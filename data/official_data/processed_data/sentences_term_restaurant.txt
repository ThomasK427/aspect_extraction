if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.__split__nori__split__negative__split__136__split__140

i reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice.__split__orange chicken/beef__split__positive__split__42__split__61

what is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.__split__food__split__positive__split__77__split__81
besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.__split__bill__split__negative__split__340__split__344

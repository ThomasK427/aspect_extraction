We live across the street and stop in for drinks on occasion since there are very few bars in this neighborhood
I had one of the best dirty martini's ever here, don't know what they did differently
I always find the bartenders are very nice and sociable
The food however is overpriced for what it is
I guess if you have kids it's a good place because the food is pretty basic
But the other places in the neighborhood have much better food
Been here a few times, it's gotten better every time
Most of the dull staff has been fired or left, and the menu is always improving
I always make crazy orders and the waitress got it all correct and seemed happy to be there
The chicken salad club is amazing
This place was so below average
I'm not too much of a complainer but $13 for a hamburger served with a wonderbread bun and the meat was burnt to a crisp
My wife and I spent $80 for soup, a burger, four total drinks and an appetizer
Atmosphere was OK
Avoid it
I was never here before, but was uptown visiting a friend and we stopped in
The food was fabulous, the atmosphere was great and the service was friendly
We just moved back to the neigborhood
To our surprise, Busby's was gone and a new restaurant was in its place
They should have kept the old one
1- the staff is inept
2- the food takes too long to come out
3-we wanted too make a reservation and were told they were booked for the night
when we got there at 7 the place was empty and when we left just a few people were having dinner
4- when the food did come out, he did not know who got what
With all of these problems happening in one night we thought a visit from the Mgr might be expected
we were wrong
i think she was busy back in the kitchen or talking too the bartender, from what we observed
Sorry guys, your place sucks
My family I gave it a chance after we were told of a 50 minute wait at Sarabeth's
Atmosphere was nice enough, and brunch menu had enough diversity
We were however met with a myraid of disappointments
First, they wouldn't make a change to their daily omelet because they were too busy
The restaurant was half empty and hey, this is New York and at $15
00 an omelet, come on!
Second, the waitress told us there were two servings in their Chicken Sausage side
Nope, one, sliced in half! Send her back to review fractions
Then, the pancakes came out raw!
The Scene Lofty sliding-glass windows and a soaring ceiling characterize Pfiff, a cozy restaurant in the space that once housed Abyssinia
Soft, gold-hued lighting and the whispering ceiling fans combine with a soundtrack of down-tempo electronica and traditional Cuban tunes for a refined, yet lounge-like intimacy
Elevated bar tables are perfect for enjoying refreshing mojitos before dinner
The Food Delicately prepared seafood is the heart of the menu
Start with slender, melt-in-your-mouth shrimp spring rolls or a Vidalia onion-and-cheese tart that strikes a lovely balance among soft, dense, musty and sweet sensations
A house pasta prepared with creme fraiche, shrimp and crayfish is pleasingly fresh and nutty, while seared yellowfin tuna pairs well with haricot verts and silky mashed potatoes
Simple desserts end the meal on a strong note, like a fresh-tasting pineapple crepe
The food here is absolutely amazing
The ribeye and pork is to die for
Not to mention the out of this world watermelon martinis
The service is always great
I actually rented the entrie restaurant for a private party in May and our entire guest list RAVED about this place
Patricia the owner was a doll to work with
I highly recommend!
The service was terrible + the food was (BEYOND) awful
It took over an hour to be served
When the food did finally arrive each person received their meal within a 20 min
of each other
That's correct the 4th person had to wait over 2 hrs
2 eat! In add
after each person was served their meal they had to return because it was either cold, over cooked, or completely wrong altogether
Mgt
came over and gave a simple shrug at our complainants and felt that four drinks would make up for our frustration
The problem is when you're waiting 2 hours to eat there was nothing 2 do but drink
The last thing we wanted after this 3 hour mess was another round
We did pay our bill, we did leave a 10% tip, we also left a promise to never return or recommend this place to anyone!
After several positive visits to Pfiff, I went with a group of 4, and they managed to make a mistake with every dinner
We all ate at different times, with one person eating after everyone else had finished
From cold mashed potatoes to hot sauce on sandwiches that never had any before, the experience was a disaster
Maybe the management changed, but I will definately never return following this dining experience
I was delightfully surprised with the food at this place
Sausage, risotto, spring rolls are recommended as appetizers
This is the first place in a long time that I have eatten a steak that was cooked just right, u know a steak is good when you can cut it with a butter knife! The Lamb, crabcakes and seafood pasta was great as well
I highly recommend this place too all
I'd like to mention the great bartender (Sprioe) a bartender who remembers your drinks all night is a big plus!
Highly recommend the risotto
The salmon over whipped chive potatoes is great too
And don't forget cocktails! Overall, I think Pfiff is great, and can't understand some of the reviews I've read that say otherwise
For the money there are much nicer placers to go in soho
it's not a bad place but completely mediocre
I was overwhelmed
The food and service; fantastic, the dj; sublime
I was there to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday evening
I cannot imagine having more fun
The best is that in this small space, the lights dim and the volume of the music increases
You look over and your server is shaking it with the rest of the staff and your friends
No pretention and that's saying a lot for this neighborhood
Oh yeah the lychee martini is the way to go
This place was really cool to chill over dinner and drinks and talk
I had a really nice time
The decor reeks of national socialism meets bauhaus
Wear your studded belts, tight blue jeans and black loafers to this over emphasized under-indulged flop house
By the way, the food was to die for
Try the shepards pie and sticky toffee pudding
This is definately a place that will be added to the lunch rotation
Good food, nice place, friendly staff all for a fair price
I HIGHLY recommend going to Pfiff
The happy hour has 2 for 1 drinks, the owners/waitstaff are very friendly and attentive, the food was amazing (I highly recommend the vegetable tart - melt in your mouth good), it has a great vibe with hip music, candle light and an eclectic crowd
I work around the corner and have had the pleasure of speaking with both the owners, waitstaff and chef (who has some amazing ideas for the fall menu) and I have never enjoyed myself with so much hospitality, good conversation, intriguing strangers, drinks specials, warm vibes
Give it a try (right by the A,C,E,1,9)
I went to Pfiff a couple of weeks ago
I was NOT impressed, the over all atmosphere SUCKED! We started at the bar where the bartender took his sweet time serving us because he was flirting with the chicks at the bar

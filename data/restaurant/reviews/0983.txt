They were turning down groups of guys but since we were a group of 3 girls, we had no problem
The girl at the door even let us cut the line
Nice is great for dancing (hiphop, reggae) but the DJ mixed it a little weird
Billy Jean followed by Sean Paul? Dance floor is packed even though only half the people were dancing
The place was crowded but still easy enough to get a drink quickly
Overall, it was not bad
Would be better if they got a better DJ
We stayed about two hours and headed next door to Plunge
We were looking for some place different, a place with a little bit of an older crowd
We were thrilled to find it at ONE
I am not sure if it was just the night we went but it worked for us
I am in my 30's now and like to be with some younger and older people
I hate feeling old at 31 but this definitely wasn't the case here
The crowd was great, the music was cool and we just had an all around good time
Can't comment on the food because we were to busy dancing and drinking and having fun
A recent Friday we went to One for some drinks, five hours later we had more than some drinks, met some really cool guys and danced up a storm
There were even some famous folk in the background
Normally I would not even write a review but that is how much a good time we all had
Check it out if you can
me and mygirlfriends went to one last saturday night and we had such a blast
We where going out to celebrate one of the girls birthdays and werent sure about going to one heard mix reviews lately
the doorguys was rude but thats typical for a club
we got in and went to the side bar and the bartenders there lite it up for us
the two guys were sooooo cute behind the bar
they make the best drinks we ever had and doing tricks with the glasses when pouring the shots for us
thanks so much for such a great night we r diffently coming back to this place over and over again
lets hope the doorguy remmember us since he was hittling on one of my girlfriends
ONE is definitely not a been there done that kind of place
I have been here numerous times and it has always been great
This time though me and my girlfriends had dinner
The food was real tasty and fairly priced
Check out the Lobster Quesadilla or Lobster Melt, yummy!!   The best part is once you are done eating you can just move into the lounge and have some drinks and then do some dancing
No need to leave when you get dining and dancing all at One place
We'll be back next to try their weekend Brunch
Me and my friends were in town from LA, actually for business but we decided to have some fun
One was highly recommended to us and it was the perfect choice
We went early just for drinks ended up sharing some food (that's their thing sharing various dishes), staying for many more drinks, dancing and meeting some really cool guys
We would recommend everything, not one think disappointed us except the fact that this was the only night we got to hang there
Go check it out!!
I have been to One many times before but only to the bar
I finally went for dinner for a friends bachelorette party on a Saturday night
We had a great time! The food was amazing and so was the atomosphere
We sat in the candle room, it was so gorgeous and comfortable- I didn't want to get up! We took our servers advice and got a bunch of dishes to share
The tuna tartare and the cheese fondue were my favorites
After dinner we moved to the lounge and had a great time
It was so convienent to have dinner and be able to party all in the same place instead of taking a cab somewhere else and waiting in line all night
Highly recommend going with a group dinner and then staying after
It's a hip and trendy place to go for drinks at the bar or bottle service by lounge but don't bother going for dinner
The staff is not trained for people having dinner specially for a larger party
As soon as your fork is down, your plate is gone
Also you risk being kicked out if you don't finish your meal on time
Few of the staff were nice enough to apologize but most seem to forget who pays their salary
I hope they realize that soon before it's too late
If you are in the area for a drink stop by to be seen and see pretty people
But if you are looking for a restaurant to have dinner look for a different venue
So many to choose from why hassle and get aggravated for an average food?
I had a surprise party for my fiancee at One and it was fantastic
The party was a huge hit
We had the party in the Cellar downstairs and it was just gorgeous
The passed hors d'oeuvres were so yummy and creative (think twice-baked potato skins and lobster and goat cheese quesadillas)
The music from the DJ upstairs was piped into our room downstairs and we danced all night! We had such a great time and ended up staying later than the end timeThe service was great, we had the best time- will definitely be back
I am usually not one to post my expeiences whether positive or negative, but I always have such a great time at One I feel obligated to refute
The food is awesome
It is so reasonably priced (especially compared to most of its neighbors!) and I love their concept of sharing everything - it is such a fun way to eat dinner
The service is always so helpful and warm
But the real reason I love One is because it can be anything you want it to be - a romantic dinner, a business dinner, more lounge-y and casual, a hoppin bar scene or the venue for a huge party in their VIP cellar
In my opinion, having a great time is always a sure thing at One!
Had table reserved, few bottles, lots of people coming--confirmed previously it won't be a problem for +15ppl, but the doorman wouldn't let in 1/2 our party and the place wasn't even that crowded
Highly NOT recommended for a crew of +4
this place is an example of how the meatpacking district will imminently disintegrate into tacky overpriced experiences
Full of a bridge-and-tunnel crown in too-tight going out tank tops, the very, very tacky sip their appletinis and chomp on the very predictable frozen-gourmet menu
please DON'T try the chicken pot stickers and molten chocolate cake, you can have them almost anywhere and these are definitely not memorable
We had to wait nearly an hour, with a reservation, and had to wipe the food and crumbs off of the bench seats as we sat down
This place incredibly tacky
I'm not sure if the be seen crowd refers to the grandmother's birthday I witnessed or the stag party of Canadians
NOT recommended
decidely older crowd
With wrought-iron decor and spacious earth-toned furniture this place is nice, cosy and chic
Can't say anything about the food because I have never dined here
However, drinks are well made and ample, the place is spacious
A elegant, crowd makes this a perfect place for singles in their 30s
However, being a twenty something year old, I felt a little out of my element
Still a great place to be but, not my choice spot
After growing up in the chelsea area and returning to the new meatpacking area this was the first restaurant i visited in the area
I made a reservation for myself and a date (a surprise for her) and was greeted warmly although i had called to say i was running a late
We were promplty seated and service was instant thx to our waiter, who was informative on the specials and drinks
The atmosphere was very romantic but chic, backround music was appropiate and eye candy for both sex's was wall to wall
After finishing our delicious meal, we skimmed around to the lounge area downstairs which was very cozy and comfortable
You can easily spend a whole evening here, i recommend the Lobster Goat Cheese Quesadilla and the Duck Spring Rolls
For Drinks, Naughty Schoolgirl is a winner for the ladies and the Blueberry Mojito is awesome
great trendy spot for a night out but to be honest the food was not worth the cost
beware
you're paying for the name and location of the place, not the quality  altho the quality didnt impress me, i loved the family style sharing plates
quite fun for large and small groups alike
btw
stay away from the cocktails
they are overly sweet
unless you like that kind of thing stick to grey goose rocks
I never realized that the food here was just amazing
the price was reasonable and service was great

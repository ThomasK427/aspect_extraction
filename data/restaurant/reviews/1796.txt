and there clearly was no longer a wait
I was shocked by the rudeness and lack of class the host exhibited
I have never had such a bittersweet dining experience
This was my first and last visit to Babbo and I do not recommend it
They clearly have no clue about class or how to treat their customers
Worth the wait if you can get a reservation a couple of months out
I really enjoyed my dinner at Babbo
Not only was the food the most delicious I've had since moving here, but the menu offered such interesting and creative choices
However, if I had anything negative to say, it would be that the wait staff is very stuffy
We are really into food and top notch restaurants, but also enjoy being able to joke with our waiters and servers
They were not having it
Overall, though, one of the best
I have been to Babbo twice
Each time was a wonderful experience
The food is exquisite, the service friendly and helpful and the wine list has something for everyone
Can't wait to go again!
I love this resturant
Absolutely fabulous
The food and the drinks are wonderful
I took my boyfriend to Babbo for his birthday celebration this past weekend and it was a culinary delight! We didn't want the evening to end! The food was amazing: we had the goose liver raviolis, pigs foot milanese and the black spaghetti with rock shrimp and chorizo for dinner
truly amazing
Every bite was wonderful
The homemade Gelatos were as good as the ones I've had in Italy! The highlight of the evening was seeing Mario at the bar
The wine list can be overwhelming but the Sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and even stopped back to make sure we were happy with our selection
Excellent restaurant from an out-of-towner's perspective
The pasta tasting menu was incredible and the wine matching superb
The service was also excellent
My rap is on the walk-in area in the front
I know that waiting space is at a premium but the tables in the front are crammed in with the waitstaff trying to wind their way through the crowd
A bad first impression but luckily the rest of the visit made up for the waiting hell
Everything about Babbo is exceptional
A truly unique dining experience
This is the way a restaurant should be run
There is no way to describe the food except go their yourself
Try the osso bucco for 2-phenominal!
Excellent everything, especially the atmosphere and the wine selection can't be beat
didn't like the ossobuco but that's just me, i guess
You'll love everything about this graceful and classy place
Babbo is the best of the expensive restaurant, it is well run without being stuffy
All the pastas are great, try the linguine with cockles, and do not miss desserts, some of the best in town
I had fun trying some new italian wines
A great brunello and an inexpensive Arneis
Great place to go for a special occasion
when i go to new york from miami, fl i make sure my trip includes a visit to babbo's, my favorite restaurant in new york
i love everything at babbo's from their appetizers to the desserts-not to mention the drinks
keep up the good work, mario!!!!
i literally have dreamt about several of their dishes
my favorite italian restaurant in manhattan; food, atmosphere service are all incredible
so friendly warm
such a nice treat even just to sit at the bar to enjoy a great glass of wine snack on delicious first courses
Good food, good service, great atmosphere
Costly but worth the trip
the food is very good, reasonable sized portions of delicious rustic italian fare
prices are a little steep
problem is, towards the front, walk-in seating area is really crowded with sporadic service
wait staff have no room to get to tables because of overflow from bar area, and knocked into the back seats of our table constantly
absolutely amazing food and wine though
and the restaurant itself is classy and nice without being overly formal
i recommend sucking it up and making the reservation (some ridiculously long wait) rather than sitting in front though
We had a reservation, but we were a half an hour late
Even though our table was gone, we only had to wait 40 minutes for another table on a saturday night
It was definitely worth it
The ambience was romantic and cozy, very knowledgeable wait staff
To top it all off, the food could not be beaten
Try the lambs tongue for appetizer
It was surprisingly good
Babbo has wonderful Italian food
The oxtail dishes are to die for and the wine list is superb
It is pricey, but well worth the treat
Babbo exceeded our expectations
We celebrated my mother's birthday here with a group of six
We made reservations well in advance and were seated promplty upon our arrival
Our waitress was incredible
We had a play at 8pm and wanted to be able to enjoy our meal
She managed our time and we enjoyed the food and company
The food was excellent and there was a great variety
I did think that there would be more pasta on the menue but everything we had was amazing
I'd go back!!
This place is so romantic and the food is amazing! The food with a bottle of 97 Super Tuscan wine is a dream! This place is really top top top of the line dining!
Although the food can be fabulous, the staff is often cool and verging on rude
Although I live in that neighborhood, and was rebuffed several times in off hours, I finally did eat there with mixed success
The staff never told me that the bar tables were not reserved, and took an attitude
If Mario's face was not plastered on Food TV and Barnes and Noble, I wonder how busy they would really be!!!!
Mario Batali does some wonderful things with some odd choices, such as tripe
But if you are willing to be adventurous, you will not be disappointed
Everything is delicious and served in just the right portions so you can fully enjoy a 4 course meal
Superb wine list and lovely ambience
the pasta i had here was the best i've ever tried, perfectly al dente! very memorable, hope i get a chance to go back again
remember to make reservations early!
There are many great restuarants in NYC but nowhere have I had what I call a culinary education and experience
Great food, great service, great wine
Yes it's expensive, but what top restuarant isn't
The place is full any day of the week, we got lucky to get a table within 30 minutes without a reservation
The wine list is huge, but you can get help with it
You also better know some Italian to help you through the menu, but go with the ravioli, they are absolutely great
Hopefully you'll get a waiter with no attitude problems, unfortunately we didn't
This was my first time at Babbo, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed an incredible dinner
The food is not for the faint at heart, but very innovative, everything had a creative and delicious blend of flavors
The only complaint we both had was that our waitress all but ignored us and had an attitude that any question we had was beneath her
When the entire menu is in Italian, this can be more than an annoyance

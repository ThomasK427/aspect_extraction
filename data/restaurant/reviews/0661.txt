Cute and cozy with excellent coffee and tea
Went there today and received excellent service from Espeth the owner
(believe that's how she spells her name)
Also had a nice little chat with her
If you're looking for a place to meet and chill, while snacking and drinking some great coffee and tea, plus EXCELLENT service, this is the place
Note that it's closed on Mondays
There seems to be a small tea boom in the East Village, New York
Several tea houses poppped up almost simultaneously
Since I personally prefer tea over coffee, it is a welcome trend
There are a few others that I haven't tried yet, but I recommend Podunk highly
Ambience is probably the most important aspect of cafes, since what drives us to cafes isn't so much what we consume there, but the quality time with our friends or by ourselves
Podunk is very cozy, warm, and friendly
My Jasmine tea and a sticky bun were exeptionally good
It is a kind of cafe that you wish you had on your block
My Podunk experience is limited to one perfect, pink-frosted cupcake to go
but that's enough to sound my approval
The incredibly nice woman behind the counter (and the pink frosting) will ensure I come back
In Short At this stylish Smith Street restaurant, bright murals adorn the walls, jewel-toned pendant lamps hang over the bar, and white linens drape over the tables
Local 20- and 30-somethings stop in for Peruvian favorites like seviche, jalea (deep-fried seafood and yucca), and palta rellena (stuffed avocado)
Rotisserie chicken, cilantro-rich chicken soup, and Argentine sirloin with chimichurri round out the seafood-heavy menu
Caramel flan, tres leches bread pudding, and chocolate empanadas are offered for dessert
After trying a lot of places on Smith street, I finally got to Mancora
Really good food, good service, and decent prices made this a great experience
The salmon with spinach and potato mash was fabulous, and the half chicken is a steal at $4
50! Definitely worth a visit!
The food here is solidly good, and the service is excellent
The portions are HUGE! Terrific value
This is one of our favorite local restaurants--and we eat out four or more times a week
We've always found the service to be courteous and friendly, and we've never been disappointed by the food
It's one of those places where you feel like a valued regular on your second visit
The menu leans toward seafood--spicy and complex ceviches are a stand-out
They make a mean pork tamale appetizer, too
And the chocolate empanada
words cannot describe
I cry for all those wasted years without its deliciousness
The service was terrible - we were constantly ignored by our waiter and made to feel like we were imposing on him when we asked him for anything
The chicken was overcooked and came with a side dish that looked like it had been thrown on the plate - no presentation at all
I think they were going for an upscale kind of feel, but the whole decor felt tacky and desperate to look classy, like a Hyundai with fake leather seats
Really a poor experience - certainly not a good date spot
Three words: ceviche de camarones! That, the Peruvian style rotisserie chicken (get a whole one) and a side dish plus don't forget - chicha moradas: a refreshing non-alcoholic drink made from boiled purple corn and lime juice with tiny pear cubes and a bit of sugar
Highly recommended
Since there were 2 of us dining, they gave us 2 pieces of bread and then never refilled it! The pizza is good but over priced I think
Any topping is $2
50/TOPPING
I had the penne ala vodka
They brought my dish a full 15 MIN after my Dad's pizza but it was awful and sauce was watered down-had 3 bite
She passed a bunch of times but never asked if something was wrong until they came to clear the table
Told her what was wrong w/it so she said sorry and took it away but then gave me a doggie bag- I didn't ask for it nor did I want but they didn't take it off the bill either! A decent place would have taken it off the bill just for the wait to get the food! $39 for 2ppl w/no apps
Pass on this 1
After reading the previous review, I had to beg to differ
From the moment I walked in, I felt completely taken care of
The staff was helpful in recomending the perfect selection of food and wine for my guest and I (particularly the bartender, who I believe was named Rich)
The food was excellent, the restaurant was clean and the service was prompt
I will definitely recomend Angelo's to my friends and family
The only bad thing I can say about the place is that they don't sell pizza by the slice
I do like Angelo's pizza and some of their other dishes (pasta e fagioli, penne with salmon
) are good as well, but it's not worth going there too often
Here are some of the problems I've found: they only deliver during the day, they wouldn't do a smaller portion of soup for a 2 year old, the service is slow and not very helpful (couldn't answer questions about preparations of the food, didn't offer us a dessert menu
)
There are so many other decent restaurants in this area on 2nd, I wouldn't make an effort to go to this one
This place has some of the best pizza I've ever had, and the waitress couldn't have been more kind
Good food overall and a wonderful (and extremely casual) dining experience
My only complaint would be that it was a slow evening (on a Saturday?) and we were still sat right next to another seated table (tables are very close together along one wall) even though there was plenty of space to separate the parties
If you like fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzarella, this is the place to go
And the crust is crisp - even in the middle of the pie
Well worth the extra cost
Yummy pizza and great service
This is a great pizza place and I want to eat it alot
Salads are also terrific
Angelo's has great pizza
From the crust to the sauce, it's delicious
This place is more like a restaurant than a pizzeria
What I don't like about Angelo's is that they're cheap! They don't do the little things
They're squeezing you for every last dime
Examples of this are charging extra money for parmesan cheese, fresh garlic, or extra sauce
Charging full price for half pie toppings, and refusing delivery (1 block) for orders under $20
These things don't cost much, but it portrays the that they're not willing to give the customer any value
They need to expand the menu some, and offer additional toppings for the pizza
Although the Pizza is upper tier, I'm giving a mid-level rating because I walked out of there thinking about how cheap they are and not how good the pizza was
The Scene Don't expect Birkenstocks and granola in this cafe: The orange walls, groovy white plastic tables, techno-jazz soundtrack and free Internet hookups attract young moderns in Steve Maddens sipping designer soy-infused teas
The Food Though the concept may seem awfully nutty crunchy, the soy-heavy, all-organic menu has broad appeal--it's not just for vegetarians
Whole-wheat paninis include a light and flavorful curried chicken with parsley, raisins, scallions, red peppers and soyannaise, and fresh turkey with roasted red pepper and sun-dried tomato
The menu shows vibrancy in dishes like thick, hearty lentil soup with carrots, potatoes and a touch of curry, as well as the tofu steak-- offers a smoky, grilled flavor along with a terrific texture
Though there's plenty to eat, many drop by for the aromatic soy milk-infused teas and coffees; it's easy to see why spicy, sweet and frothy combinations like honey-ginger soya tea are so popular
Everything I've had at Soy Luck Club is great (and I spent quite a few hours there on my laptop while working on a writing project)
The very BEST thing they make, the food that even non-vegetarians savor and devour, is the TOFU SALAD SANDWICH
I've never liked egg salad, but I'm a vegan now and thought I'd give this sandwich a try
Bits of celery add crunch to the soft tofu mixture, and the fatty blandness of the avocado is set off perfectly by crusty bread with sweet bursts of raisin
It is truly an unbeatable sandwich! Service is friendly, and you can feel comfortable spending five hours there with your computer
I love their Soy drinks and great Apple Tuna Salad sandwich
Great Music and relaxing place to hang out for a meal and snack
Original decor mixed with a refreshing selection on the menu, ranging from the best Soyafrost in town to the mouth watering paninis
I have tried most of the items on the menu I have to say that everything I have tried from the bar or from the kitchen is fabulous
My favorite it the green tea honey soyafrost and the tuna panini but if you can't make up your mind, the friendly and helpful staff would never fall short of a good recommendation
Even though I am not a computer guy, the free DSL access must be heaven to the casual internet surfer! Overall, the healthy and taasty selection offered by Soy Luck Club is definitely above and beyond your corner cafe and more 'buck worthy' than Starbuck's
It's the best kept secret in new york
I had the best experience
Their drinks are amazing
Their Honey Ginger Soy Steamer is addictive!! Great selections of dairy free desserts
Salads are fresh

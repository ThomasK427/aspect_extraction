Tapas in its original form with a new york twist of good service and lovely environment
Must go!
I had never tasted such great spanish food
Everything is fresh and the wine list is amazing
good food, good ambiance and good service make this place a unique experience for us all, especially for wine lovers
A valuable wine list that offers amazing wines by the bottle or by the glass
I have discovered a great spanish spot in Tribeca after being dissapointed few times in regards to spanish cuisine in NYC
This place brought back all my memories from Spain and tapasbars in Barcelona
Highly recommended for new couples!
We have moved recently to Tribeca and was happy to find this amazing spanish tapas restaurant
Food is superb, some dishes are exceptional such as the meat balls, the wrapped sirloin with pesto and the Paella which was the best I have had in years!  The ambiance is cozy and welcoming and our server was knowlegable and very attentive
We had great time and will definitely go back and recomend Azafran to our friends
Since walking into Azafran, I felt very comfortable
The welcoming matador photograph at the entrance, the clean and simple design and the relaxed music have caused me to feel at home
The food was outstanding and was up to my expectations
I love Spanish Tapas and always looked for a good restaurant from this kind in New York
The job they have done with the space in amazing
The sea food paella was better than many paellas I have had in Spain! I will recomend this restaurant to all my friends
I'm from spain and enjoyed this restaurant very much
Some of the food is betterthan in my country like the shrimp in garlic sauce and the sea food paella
After eating in other spanish restaurants I know this one is the best
very recommended
We went because of the high citysearch rating
yet left rather disappointed
There were some highlights, like the Sangria and the service was well above par and a few of the appetizers were quite good, but all of this was outweighed by the subpar paella
To be an excellent Spanish tapas restaurant you need to serve excellent paella and this one didn't
We ordered the seafood paella, but it was as if the rice and all the usual paella fixings were cooked and then the seafood thrown on top at the end
The calamari wasn't cleaned properly, they left the inner scales and we were all picking them out of our mouth
You'd be better served at Pipa and in a better part of town
I was looking for a good tapas restaurant when I stumbled upon Azafran
Not has it become one of my favorite Tapas restaurant but also one of my favorite restaurants in the city! The food is to die for and the service is impeccable
Try the scallops or the croquetas
You will not be disappointed at this place
The food knocked me off my feet! We were a large group, so we tried pretty much everything on the menu
Everything was very good
Stood out: artichoke appetizer, The chillian sea bass, the raspberry mousse
i SPENT AN EVENNG IN THE COMPANY OF PROFESSIONAL WAITERS, EXCELLENT CHEFS AND LOVELY MUSIC
WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
I know Tapas are appetizers but they should also charge at appetizer prices
Unfortunately, Azafran charges too high and there is nothing spectacular about the Tapas nor the $30 seafood Paella
In a nutshell, this place is expensive for the wrong reasons (except for maybe because it's in Tribeca)
My date and I arrived promptly for our dinner reservation on Sat
night, only to be told by the rude host that they didn't have a record of my booking
The host provided a half-hearted apology, but tried to redeem the situation by offering us a glass of wine on the house and told us he would try to squeeze us in
We accepted this gesture because the ambiance was nice, the food LOOKED good, and the wine list was full of interesting, good valued Spanish wines
However, when we again approached the host after 30 minutes of him walking by us without looking, he acted like he'd never intended to find us a table
Unacceptable
Now stranded in TriBeCa on a saturday night without a reservation, we ended up being pleasantly suprised by the food and efficient service at the Odeon
Service and hospitality was superb
Atmosphere is VERY romantic
Staff was genuine and informative
Management was always present throughout the evening and was there to shake hands and say goodbye upon our exit
Food was superb
(try their Cabrales cheese!!)
We had a GREAT time!
I love tapas, but sometimes being a veggie can be limiting
Azafran has a great selection of veggie tapas (the phyllo cigars and portobello mushrooms were fantastic), and the vegetarian paella was delicious! The service was great, and the owner was nice
I will definitely go here again!
For long time I'm looking for a Spanish food in that level
The food is amazing
The exelent service, the design and the music were exactly what I was looking for
The Spanish food in town is good but here I got the quality and the touch, which makes it something else
Delicious, appetizing, fulfilling, welcoming, great money value
I could have gone on by why bother - it's right here, accessible for everyone in manhattan and conveniently located in the heart tribeca
The menu is complemented by a clean and chic design
the tapas loving people divide into those who have already been to azafran and have loved it, and those who are going to love it
Azafran is an excellent tapas restaurant and bar
I was very impressed
The staff is courteous and respectful
I felt like a movie star from the moment I entered their cool slick entry-way till the moment I breezed out; smiling from ear to ear
The food was amazing and the ambiance clean and inviting
Their sangria and mojitos are out of this world
Their wine, almonds, cheese plates, tortilla and gazpacho are among the best in the city
This place is authentic, delicious and very welcoming
I obviously had great time, and will definitely be returning with a date
We had high hopes for great tapas
what a let down! Before we even sat we tried making small talk with the manager as we were waiting to get seated (even though there were empty tables)
He was so rude to us- we should have taken it as a sign and left then and there
The service was awful- couldn't get a waitress to save our lives
The food was fair- We spent over $300 and then were told that they needed the table could we get up!!!  Please save your time and money!
When my (pregnant) friend asked about a non-alcoholic version of a drink, the answer was simply no, with no further suggestions
Both of our glasses - her water glass and my wine and water glasses were bone dry before anyone (not our server) asked if we wanted more
Our server also couldn't recommend specialties of the house, according to her all was good, but not true, as the artichoke was bland and the chicken kabobs over cooked
That said, there were many menu items that were fantastic - shrimp dates, pepper salad, grilled asparagus, croquettes
What a great place: Great food, great service, great value
Don't miss the chorizos, the anchovies (I know, I know, trust me, you'll become a fan), the cheese platter
Try them all, everything is great on the menu
Also, great service, the owner/host makes sure you feel welcome
A winner
2 'sharing' size tapas and a drink, with service included, ended up costing $45/pp
Pretty expensive as tapas bars go, but is also on the high-end of the spectrum
Mojito and Martini may not be their best drinks
Wish we'd tried the sangrias
Awesome! Absolutely outstanding - we got seated on Valentine's Day with no reservations and the place was full for the night
The food was amazing - and great service
Definitely a great find and will come again
We ordered 6 tapas, tasting size, and when it all came, we could not decide which we liked best! A must go
Try the flourless chocolate cake - it is to die for!
Wonderful Experience
Shrimp Date dish is incredible

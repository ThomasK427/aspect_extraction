Large round booths make it spacious for dining for 2-4
The food is pretty good, roast beef is a standout
Otherwise, everything else is just average
I would go there for top notch service and a great dining atmosphere
Otherwise, if you're looking for a ultra, ultra fine culinary experience, this is not the place
Check out the website for pic
It could be better
The atmosphere is nice and the drinks are good
The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for
Our waitress had a weird attitdue toward us, it was not really bad per se but somewhat uncomfortable
Butter has clearly opted for the quick buck attracting the most trendy, shallow clientele with their VELVET ROPES and surly staff
The space is fabulous but WELL-WORN, with peeling wallpaper, scuffed wood floors, torn banquettes, etc
My last visit, I was thoroughly checked by the bouncer before being admitted to the EMPTY dining room for my reservation
Once seated, the service was terrible, the food was average but not inspiring
The waiter kept pouring wine into glasses filled with water
Flatware was dropped on us
The food took forever when it did come, I didn't have a fork to eat it with! SOMEONE must educate the staff on the fundamentals of service AT LEAST! Overall, we left our $600 bill (be aware that a 20% gratuity is added) with nothing more to think about than how we would have rather been at Joe's Pub
You'd be better off
Looking around the room, it was obvious that diners were initially there for the scene - but what becomes rapidly aparent is that the people in the kitchen are using the plates as canvass
The determined and unwaivering use of seasonal ingredients and the steadfast committment to high quality is what diners at butter come away with
Whether you are healing your soul with spare ribs cooked with love - or tasting the devine halibut, sturgeon or scallops
you can't go wrong
My reccomendation - don't miss the angel hair with caviar or the friend doughnuts
Enjoy an amazing evening at Butter
The new chef at Butter has outdone herself
We went for NYC Restaurant Week and were so impressed with our lunch
The food was fabulous and service was wonderful
What a great deal for $20
12
And now that Restaurant Week is still over
the prix fixe continues for an amazing $25
Go! You'll love!
I love the popcorn they serve at the bar, and I really enjoyed the food but boy, if I try to speak to anyone even a person next to me is not possible here
So Loud!!
Butter is atrocious
I spent the entire 2
5 it took to get any kind of service being horribly embarassed that I brought my date there
The crowd was totally BT, the waiter was completely unprofessional and inattentive, food mediocre
I had to ask twice for a wine list, the waiter gave SO much attitude for no reason, a terrible wine selection- nothing from South America or Australia and four pages of new world (read california)
They were trying to pass themselves off as hip by giving the smallest servings possible for ridiculous sums of $
They fried olive tapenade like a tempura
WORST OF ALL WAS THE DJ
think biggie to kid rock to old school mariah to nirvana to bad trance
in that order
it totally killed the mood, more so than the peeling cedar wallpaper
ugly birch forest background ruined the ambience
NOT WORTH IT
The review above should be updated
Butter recently acquired a new Executive Chef, Alexandra Guarnaschelli (formerly of Daniel) who has completely revamped their New American menu
I've been a fan of Butter since the beginning and can honestly say that my nights there are always a sure thing for a great time
Somehow they had a mix-up with our dinner reservation, however got seated
The warm shrimp salad was excellent! Blackened mahi mahi sucked (too many various spices mixed together that did not go with the fish at all! yuck!)
The NY steak was great
Very nice design and ambiance was very romantic
On the weekends it gets really crowded and loud
I was taken here as a gift, and I had never heard of this restaurant before
I sat in the downstairs area, and it seemed like a preety happening place by the bar on the upper level
Our table was preety small, but the food made up for the slight discomfort
The steak I had was out-of-this-world, definetly one of the best I've ever had, and the crepes I had for dessert were equally satisfying
Lots of eye-candy, and gorgeous waitresses
The room was preety dark, but an enitre wall was transparant, and it glowed red from the wine rack that lay behind it, which was a cool effect
Went to Butter for the first time last Saturday
The decor was beautiful, as were the waiters and bar tenders
Service was superb, a plus ten!! I will be back for more for sure!!
We went to Butter on a Saturday night, it was surprisingly empty
The hostesses were sooo friendly
Sit downstairs for the scene and the atmosphere
Very romantic and a great place to bring a date
It turns into a club/lounge at 10
We had the romaine salad which was awesome and the portion was big
They also brought us some samples from the kitchen of their special--polenta
I got the salmon, cooked perfectly and so tasty
My friend got the chicken which was also very good
Yes, it's a little pricey but worth every penny in our opinion
Everyone was soooo friendly, we'll be going back!
Went to Butter on Monday night for a friend's birthday dinner at like 11:00pm, the kitchen was supposedly closed, but we spoke to the manager and we were seated promptly
They had a Monday night party going on, with a nice mix of music, the waiter was awesome, the minute the wine glasses were low he would bring another!!
The crowd was really good looking and the decor is excellent
It was a bit expensive for 2 people, but we did have lots of drinks ( Drinks are very pricey) I would definitely recommend it, Mondays are pretty cool
Then go next door for Karoake night @ Pangea
I was quite unimpressed with Butter
The menu is boring and very unimaginitive, but we managed to find some things to order
What we did order was just average (my halibut was ok, though a bit dry and my friend's pork chop was ok, though a bit tough)
Given the attitude and the prices, I expected more
One utter disappointment was the raspberry beignets
Someone please tell the pastry chef that Dunkin' Donuts jelly donuts can't be passed off as beignets
The service, however, was superb!   The decor is very woodsy, which offended me to think that so many trees died to make chairs for the lounge (which were cut out tree stumps) and for the cavernous walls and ceiling
How ironic that there was a huge mural of a forest to admire at the back of the restaurant
My friends took me for my birthday dinner and I was simply in awe by the ambience and design of a place behind a dull outer facade
The food and service was excellent
Definately worth checking out on a weekday to avoid weekend chaos
So much (expensive) for so little
The table ordered the tasting menu which was a 5 course meal
I swear we came out of the restaurant wondering if we could quickly stop by Cozy's for a burger before the show
My friend's boyfriend was not happy
Decor was really nice
Food not bad, really good sweetbread, better than the one at Babbo's
As my divine date traversed the cavernous archway to greet me, her beauty was accentuated by the glorious wood finishes and perfectly lit hallway to the main dinig area
We were promptly seated
Our Aussie waiter was attentive and knowledgeable

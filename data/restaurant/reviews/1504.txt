This is place is great for a snack or dessert
The coffee is from Venezuela and is terrific! They have a very nice selection of pastries and also pastelitos (savoury pastries)!!! The location is great- right off of Union Square
Get a coffee and pastry to go and relax in the nearby park
Stopped in for lunch one day - had turkey alfalfa on a croissant, which was very tasty
Just the right amount of butteriness! They also gave us a small pastry to try, which was delicious
I would definitely go back and try others
We were seated upstairs in the lounge, around 7pm
Music was blasting (speakers located practically on top of every table), and we asked the waitress if they can turn it down
There was about 2 other people eating in the lounge
It's turned down for about 2 mins, and then back up again
We ask again, the obnoxious maitre'd comes over, makes an obviously fake apology and comes up with a story that the owner said to turn it up, and one other patron asked for it to be turned up
I don't know about you, but I've never asked for music to be turned up
He even makes some excuse about it being busy at 9pm, and it's a lounge, not the restaurant
With two othet patrons eating, I highly doubt any of them asked for the music to be turned up, not that it was even that great music
Aside from the bad hospitality, the food was good, overpriced, but good
I know big box asian fusion is hot; but don't waste your time at this place
Was seated 45 minutes late; food and service was average; a real tourist trap
Happened to walk in here one night
before it officially opened
Had the peach sake sangria
which is sooo good! A must try
Also tried the pumpkin cheesecake, served in a cappucino cup
the more i ate, the more i liked it
The space is big and beautiful and you can't help but feel glamorous here
Can't wait to come back and try the food
Japonais turns out really special, intriciate and beautifully presented dishes
The Rock offered do-it-yourself wagyu beef BBQ
Separately, the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio is THE BEST deal at Japonais - you get 16 slices of beef for $10! Don't forget to order the Eight Warrior Samurai
The Chocoloate Indulgence for Two was a wonderful end to our meal
Do not come here for the sushi/sashimi - save your money for Sushi Yasuda
this place looks all bright and sunny, but it's gross! best burgers on earth? i don't think so
the $5 burger was thin, dry, and way overdone (although the pickles and tomato had nice flavor and freshness)
the $3 crinkle cut fries were mushy - you'd be better off throwing some frozen ore-ida into the oven at home
the chocolate shake i ordered was tasty, but for $5 it better be! they only take cash, so i walked to an inconvenient ATM down the block
it's a small place, but they have THREE flatscreened televisions - they should've invested that money in some better quality ingredients
this place is totally not worth it - i was really disappointed
you'd be better off grabbing a burger at a deli or a diner
Tried this location several times and all burgers are consistently overcooked, a bit dry and fairly tasteless
O-rings were inedible: hard, chewy, greasy and over-battered
Lucky sauce? I am guessing mayo with a dose of liquid smoke
Service was slow on one occasion, much slower on others
Interior decor is aggresively ugly in clashing bright yellow, pink and orange
On the upside, the pricing (while too high) is all in even dollar amounts, with the tax embedded
Thus all checks are in even dollar amounts ! Go to Wendys
Lucky's burger is a standard burger done well
Pillowy bun, flavorful meat (can't tell exactly what spices they're using) with a nice outer char
On the one hand, I wish they'd do better than iceberg lettuce, but I can see the appeal of the All-American backyard burger and it, inevitably, includes iceberg lettuce
I would steer clear of the fries if you're looking for crisp
These are crinkle cut and not super crispy
I love this place
The most flavorful burger in NYC
The black and white shake and the onion rings were delicious as well
I'll be back often
While the Famous Brooklyn-based chain has now taken its act to Broadway in Manhattan, the Times Square version has a lot to work on
The place looks fabulous, sporting an outside patio so folks can enjoy a meal outside and a nice interior with beautiful people, great lighting, stylish furniture, and a well dressed staff
The food however, is not impressive, especially the infamous cheesecakes
The cheesecakes were heavy, creamy, and had a texture about them that seemed to indicate they weren't as fresh
The sandwiches seemed quite large, but nothing different than any other chain TimesSquare restaurant ala TGI Friday's or Applebees
The prices are a bit high for diner wannabe food but the setting is Times Square, hence, it may seem cheap compared to other restaurants in the area
Service was all over the place, with food runners and wait staff bustling back and forth, however, our waiter had ignored us for most of the night
He got some extra tip when he decided to hook us up with a free piece of cheesecake because they had run out of a few other types that we wanted
All and all, this place is no better than the other corporate chains that sport their niche in the food world and their niche (cheesecakes) is unfortunately nothing to write home about
Went to check it out THE SUSHI to see if its all that! We got blown away
The freshness of the fish amazing
This place is Nobu with some beat awesome atmosphere
this new sushi lounge/bar is very cool
plenty of room to lounge and smoke (if you like)
the outside garden is very relaxing
the inside is modern chic, but comfortable
i love the flavored strawberry and mango mojitos
come for happy hour and they are half priced
i cant get enough of the sushi
my favorite is the sushi sandwich
nothing like i have tasted before
very original
the crowd is mixed, so there is someone for everybody
tip the sushi chef well and he will deep fry a live mini-crab before your eyes
so tasty
this one will be around for a long time
ps
live dj's make every night a happening party
i love the food and the party scene
i also loved the outside garden
full of plants and very relaxing
great drinks too and always a cool dj playing
Even better than it looks! This place is hot, hot, hot! Stylish, sleek comfortable, with amazing sushi (original classics) as well as the best happy hour (5 hours) in town
Outrageous original cocktails
got to sample the new Volcano Bowls, awesome! The lounge is great after work or on Sunday nights
Their bamboo garden is the perfect place to chill with friends after a long day
Goodlooking people abound, even the staff
Video screens with outstanding visuals combined with great live DJ's make for the perfect atmosphere
They even have original paintings by a hot new artist, very cool
We love this place
You'll be seeing us there every week!
Yummy Guys + Yummy Liquor + Yummy Sushi = AMAZING!  I think it's the perfect combination! I'm not one to write reviews, but I went to Bamboo 52 after seeing it on here, and now I'm in love
I love a cocktail on a patio
ahh  So basically, I'm highly recommending it
GO!
The space is beautiful
The Sushi is great

This place is so worth visiting
The oral menu is extensive
You basically can name what you want and they will make it for you without charging an arm and a leg for it
They have delicious homemade red pepper dip with their delicious flat bread
you can even buy the dip there
Everyone is friendly and the food selection can't be beat
One problem, the waiters are sometimes hard to understand with their accents
Even with a reservation, we had to wait a half hour
But it was all worth it
The food is amazing
Even with many people waiting to be seated, we were not rushed at all
Our waiter was fantastic and was willing to recite the specials again for us if we wanted him too
(You'll only know what I mean when you go there
) And having Rocco come over to say Hi
gives it such a personal touch
But the best part was the bill
For what we had (many bottles of wine), we expected to pay about $100 a piece
What a nice surprise that it was about $60 :-)
The atmosphere was a bit loud, but it was warm and inviting
The food was absolutely delicious
Everything from the appetizers to the main course
My only regret is that I was too full to sample dessert
It's a place definitely worth visiting
I can not say enough of this place
Warm, homemade flatbread, sundried tomato paste to smear over it
I never have to open the menu
We just wait for one of their very informative staff members to recite the special's of the day
We even leave the choice of wine up to them
They really take care of you in this place
I have never had a bad meal yet
Every special occasion is spent here
And regardless of how busy they are, you will never feel rushed
Only problem is being seated
the place is always packed
I suggest early dinner reservation or go during mid-week
What a wonderful restaurant
A surprising twist on ordinary Italian fare
A special appetizer called Vegetable Carpaccio with Salmon was delicious
The combination of ingredients made this dish so fresh I invisioned myself sitting on a deck on the ocean enjoying a wonderful summer breeze! The baked filet of Trout was sublime
To finish things off have the Cannoli
Fresh pastry tube which was stuffed to order
Crisp and tasty
The wine list was exciting and interesting with some fasinating surprises
The restaurant was very busy, but the service was great
The staff knows all about the food and the Chef is very visible visiting tables and overseeing the dining room
There is culinary art outside of Manhattan and it is in Astoria!
My wife and I found this place by accident after our flight out of LaGuardia was canceled and it has rapidly become one of our favorite restaurants in the entire city and the place we take out-of-towners for nonpareil Italian food made with love
Mussels in bread pot, homemade ravioli filled with things like swordfish and truffles, orange-ginger shrimp and pizzas from a wood-burning oven in back are all recommended
Don't get too comfortable with the menu -- the specials list is usually phenomenal, as long as the actual menu and will typically not set you back more than ordering off the menu
The service is friendly and hyper-efficient
Go, go, go!!!
Although all foods are great, I strongly recommend an antipasto of steamed mussel served with bread pot
You can choose either white or red sauce, you can have not only mussel but also freshly baked bread pot, which is soaked with delicious sauce and it is very good! But be careful, you may be pretty full before main dish coming
By the way, Never expect to have a seat without reservation
I like dining in at Mike's because its the only option for the Ditmars area of Astoria in terms of 24 hour places
The service is very hit or miss but has been more hit than miss as of late
The food is quite decent and comes at an affordable price as well
One thing I enjoy about Mike's is their immense variety in their menu
They offer Mexican, Italian, American, and Greek dishes, which is a definite edge over other diners I've seen
They're situated right next to the subway, which is a perfect location for their business
This place is really bad
The guacamole was tasteless, rice and beans were pretty cold, and the meat was not tastefull like one could expect from a Mexican restaurant
The waitress who served us didn't speak any English, not even the basic greetings such as good afternoon, how are you?, or did you like the food?
The previous poster was correct, this place looks like a dive, but is quite the Mexican restaraunt
It has the most authentic Mexican found I have found in the Metro area and the margaritas are outstanding
They make every single one from scratch so you don't get the overbearing sweetness like you do with the machine ritas, just a good flavorful drink
And the prices cannot be beat
This is a wonderful place for any night of the week and their jukebox is always jumpin
This place is excellent
The food is authentic Mexican and Delicious
The service is OK , as they do not speak much English
I love the atmosphere and the great juke box which plays catching Spanish songs
Don't be fooled by its appearance
It looks like a dive but serves up fresh authentic Mexican fare you won't normally find in your average Tex-Mex style restaraunt
Meaning, not that you won't find burritos and nachos, but that you won't find cheddar/ Jack style cheeses
They use mexican white cheese instead
Try the cactus
(somehow it's fresh), or order a special
The mole sauce passes the test
Tried their meat souvlaki (usually get chicken) and I'm hooked! Excellent fries, too
Fantastic tzatziki! MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
Love Zygo's; especially the lamb sandwich and leon potatoes; the best!
I live right around the corner from Zygos and always take friends here when they make the trip out to Astoria
Everything is good here! The service is friendly, the food is awesome (I especially recommend the lamb dishes here) and the prices are unbelievable
You can get a lamb sandwich (really delicious and filling) for $4
95, and no entree costs more than about $13
The decor isn't the best and the place is very modest, but if you're around Ditmars Blvd
, this place is a must!
We had the most excellent night
The food was marvalous, I recomend the octopus its delicious, and the chillian seabas made to the perfection
The service was outstanding
Over all the night was wonderrful
Telly's Taverna is and always has been an Astoria favorite
The grilled octupus, green salad and the spicey feta dip are better than I've had anywhere else
(even Greece)
I go to Telly's often and the fish is always so fresh!! On the weekend there might be alot of noise but the Garden in the summer will make you think your in Greece! Amazing place to eat
The service is always very good
They also give you loukoumades on the house after every meal
except for Saturdays unfortunately
I would highly recomend Tellys

Once we sat down the service was prompt and curtious without being overbearing
The grilled zucchini pizza was one of the best i have tasted (and believe me i've eaten a lot of zucchini)
I had the fish and couldn't belive the moistness, trust me i tried my friends and theirs was just as good
One recommendation is to leave room for the dessert
oh the dessert!
The ambience at this resturant was warm and cozy
The fried calamari was the freshest and tastest I had in a long time
The choice of entrees was just right (Not Overwhelming)
The service was great as well as the prices
I would recommend this resturant to all my friends
This was my fourth time to Blue Grotto, and as always, everything was wonderful
First off, the service is excellent
My friends and I had a great time with our waiter
The food was so good, my friends were impressed that I picked such a good place
The aren't many places in my neighborhood, it's nice to walk across the street to something like Blue Grotto
FINALLY A NEW PLACE ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE WORH A REVIEW
FOOD GREAT, DECORE AMAZING, THE SERVICE WAS DELIGHTFULL OUR SERVER ANNE MADE OUR NIGHT SPECIAL AND THE MANAGER JASON WAS VERRY ACCOMODATING ALSO, THANKS EVERYBODY AT THE BLUE GROTTO, WE WISH YOU LOTS OF SUCCESS!!!!!
I HAD DINNER LAST NIGHT AT THE BLUE GROTTO, TO MY SUPRISE THE ENTIRE MEAL WAS GREAT, THE UES IS KNOWN FOR SOME SO SO PLACES
THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
OUR SERVER WAS EXCELLENT, THE MANAGER BOUGHT US A COCKTAIL JUST FOR TELLING HIM IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME HERE, ALL IN ALL WE WILL BE BACK; NEXT TIME WITH SOME FRIENDS, PLUS DENNIS LEARY AND SPIKE LEE WERE THERE TOO HAVING COCKTAILS
My girlfriend and I were going to to dinner and a movie on Thursday, we stopped by Blue Grotto for our first visit
We each had the dates in bacon to start, I had this great pork chop and she had the tuna
I must say, the food was much better than expected
We didn't have time for dessert, but our waiter talked us into coming back after our movie for this chocolate tasting dish which was out of this world
We ate the dessert in a somewhat busy bar scene, with great drinks (try the vodka raspberry lemonade!) I think we found a great spot to hang out during the week
I was really excited about trying out this place since it's a beautiful restaurant for the UES
The food was pretty good
However, I won't be returning due to the rudeness of the manager/owner
Service was perfectly fine except there was a mistake on the bill which our waiter corrected
However, our waiter subsequently got chewed out by his manager within our earshot for making a mistake
Completely ridiculous thing to get upset over
I felt so sorry for our waiter
Won't be going back based on principle
My roommate and I were pleasantly surprised when we stumbled upon Blue Gratto
The drinks were perfect and the atmosphere was unlike many of the places on the Upper East Side
It is a nice refuge from the usual bars filled with ex-frat boys and sorority girls
And Jason made the experience even more enjoyable
We are definitely planning on returning
finally- a neighborhood restaurant on the UPPER EAST SIDE to rave about, our waiter Stephen not only served us an incredible meal but serenaded my friend for her birthday , the decor is amazing and the food was first rate, our only complaint was that we had to wait for a table on a tuesday night
My friends and I were pleasantly surprised with the decor, service and food
Everything was wonderful
I would definetly returm
Best compliment: ladies room was superb! Clean, pretty and well stocked with amenties
The only complaint: thought the sangria was light and fruity, it was rather weak
But still tasty
I was in last Friday and had a wonderful waiter (whose name I will keep anonymous)
everything was great
until the manager started harping on him within earshot of us
I was mortified
Is this how management treats their employees? If they are being treated this way while the restaurant is open, how are they being treated when the doors are closed? I have to say, my friend and I will not be coming back solely because of the manager
I realize this is New York and all, but rudeness should have a limit
Everyone knows that there aren't too many red-hot places to go on the UWS, but when you have a place as consistent and comfortable as Jean-Luc, red-hot and trendy isn't shouldn't be your first choice
I pop into JL about once a month or more and think that the service and food and relaxed atmosphere are great
The managers comp me here and there with a glass of wine or a little appetizer and they make me feel like a welcome member of the family
Carl is one of the floor managers and he's a class act
There are beautiful bartenders (Maria? Whew!), sexy music, good lighting, booze, and good food
what more could you want
Spoiled NYers - this place would be a destination spot in any other city
We ordered 2 salads, to be followed by medium-rare lamb and steak
When the steak and lamb showed up 10 minutes later, I informed the waitress that we had ordered salads
No apologyalthough the manager then came over to apologize and assured us that we would not be seeing those same exact cuts of meat
What followed? Yesthe exact same dishes came out
How do I know? Well, first the plates were about 250 degrees to the touch, and my medium-rare steak looked like a hamburger
I called our waitress back over and pointed this out, even cutting through the middle of my steak to show her
That looks pretty medium-rare to me! Im not kidding thats what she said
I had to basically beg to have it taken back
Of course my date was too nice to complain
Unrealsimply unreal
Stay away from Jean-Luc
Stay far away
Non pretentious delicious food
Excellent service
I sat around being drunk and eating bread and drinking water for a good long time after I paid my check without any hint at displeasure at my being -- drunk and happy and full
Portions are generous and the food is really good
Costs a bit -- $35
I FEEL COMPELLED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE MY ROOMMATE AND I WE TRYING A NEW PLACE IN THE SAME NEIBORHOOD AND GOT HORRIBLE SERVICE
WE HAD TO SEND OUR FOOD BACK IT WAS SO BAD
WE DECIDED TO GO TO JEAN-LUC AND AS ALWAYS WERE BLOWN AWAY ONCE AGAIN
CAN'T SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT JEAN-LUC
THE SERVICE IS EXCEPTIONAL, THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS COMFORTABLE AND COMPLETELY UNPRETENTIOUS FOR THE HIGH CALIBER OF FOOD AND SERVICE JEAN-LUC PROVIDES
WONDERFUL AS ALWAYS!!!!!!
On no
not another poor excuse for folks to cross the bridge and infest the upper west side
Unfortunately, JL is one of many dissappointing attempts at a decent UWS restaurant
The best part of our experience (besides the company) was that we were comped drinks (for waiting 1 1/2 hours for our table - with a reservation!) and the frites (which taste curiously like McDonalds fries)
The ambiance was pleasant but dated (and the pleather in our booth was taped together!), the staff was cute and spunky, but the food lacked in freshness, creativity, and seasonal appropriateness
This is a place for young folks (trying to be hip) and old folks (trying out new hips) with money to burn and undiscriminating taste for decent cuisine
I took a date there after reading the rave reviews
I was thoroughly disappointed
The escargot jenny was poorly prepared and tasted more like a salt lick than a delicacy
The fois gras was overcooked and of poor quality
The steak au poivre was good, but not worth its price
My date's filet mignon came to the table with the string still attached
Our waiter left at 10:30 after delivering our main course without introducing a replacement
As a final insult to injury, they placed our leftovers upside down in the bag, causing them to leak everywhere before we even left the restaurant
As for the scene, the plush red velvet seating was quite nice but the obnoxious, hipster patrons left much to be desired
Overall, I found the experience embarrassing for the restaurant and myself
The food is hit or miss, but by hit I mean no more than a 7 out of 10
The desserts are absolutely awful
The service was good though

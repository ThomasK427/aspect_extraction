But they could improve their barbecue offerings and they need to keep trying
Take the restaurant for what it is
It's a niche player in the NYC restaurant sceene (southern bbq cooking)
If you feel like going for good ribs and great drinks, you go to Blue Smoke for dinner
Food is not going to blow you away, but you'll have a good meal
The staff by the way is excellent
very attentive and cordial
I had a good experience
I say it's worth going when you get that rib craving
Hey guys, this is New York, its not a shack in North Carolina
The ribs were excellent, the sides interesting, varied and delicious
Loved the sausage starter! The dessert sampler was fantastic! Aside from a very dizzy bartender, the service was uniformly excellent and extremely helpful friendly
As far as a wait, I arrived for an 8:30 reservation and was seated at a great table by 8:35
No problems
Try it yourself and make up your own mind!!
my wife and i have dined a few times, everything goes up and down though
one day the ribs are succulent, the next dry
one night our waitress is timely, the next absent
our favorite part that is always consistent, is the tall maiter d who remembers our face and names, but we hear he is gone now
know the saying if it aint broke dont fix it? the people in charge should keep that in mind so that every dinner experience is the same
consistency works!
I love BBQ! Give me a slab of Ribs and I will tear right into them and if you have a BBQ Place you got to have good ribs
I went to Blue Smoke ordered the Texas Style Ribs and was dissapointed, they were not as meaty as I need and were not as tasty as I dreamed
Would I go again reculantly I would say yes, with the lack of quality BBQ place in the city and the Great Block Party that they orginazed a couple of weekends back I would go and try something else but if it was like the first time I would be done with this place
They also forgot to visit Philly to see their Cheese Fries, but they did have Great Beers on tap
I also noticed Dan Rather there
damn that guy is old but was dressed to the T
I have read many good reviews of Blue Smoke, still no one can reallytell me what makes this so place great
I will say the bar area is loaded with liquor and look funs
but the rest of the place resembles TGIF's
I purchased 9 Ribs for $25 and it tasted like ribs from chinese restaurant down the street
Please save your money and just go for drinks!!!!
Okay, if your going to NY! You have to go here
The drinks are the best
The BBQ is AWESOME! Everyone in our group LOVED the food
The Mac N' Cheese is the best I have ever tasted, we were all fighting over it
I took the BBQ sauce home (it's bottled) and my husband LOOVVEED it
Yummy!
The Smoked Rib Meat is far supior to all other Barbque eatery in NY
The texture, smoked flavor are terific
Sauces are extreamly tasty
Last week i oreder a special, Prime Ribs of Beef, it was extreamly poor, lacked flavor
Stick to the ribs
I think a lot of the negative reviews must have been from when this place first opened
I finally got to try it last night
The service was amazing
Really friendly waiters and staff who could not do enough for you
I do not know how anyone could think these ribs are dry! They are very flavorful and were obviously marinated for a long time
The sides were delicious - mac cheese, spinach, baked beans, string beans
we enjoyed them all
I was not completely blown away, but would definitely go back!
I've been to blue smoke now 5 times and have yet to have a bad experience
the ribs are always great and the chicken is good
i've had every side on the menu and was impressed- the mac/cheese is awsome, while at first embarrased to admit i ordered mac and cheese from a nyc restaraunt on a saturday night, the table had to order more because i couldn't keep everyones fork out of it
the music is also great-- except for the george thorogood being blocked
all of you with poor reviews have NO CLUE what good food is!
If you know you are going for a getting dirty dinner, this is the place
It is unbelievable
My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst
The wings have certainly decreased in size since it opened but are nonetheless great
Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great
Great beer selection too, something like 50 beers
BTW, the service is very good
The ribs were fantastic, everyone at the table agreed that they were the best that they had ever had (of course none of us are from highly carnivorous states)
Service was very attentive
Our favorite side, the sweet potato fries
Collard greens could use some work
We think you get shorter ribs in the sampler, so just go for the baby back ribs
everyone confirmed they were the best of all options
Don't get seated in a booth unless you like TV and sitting near the bar crowd
If you're looking for barbeque like Dallas BBQ (soaked in sauce from a bottle, generic, homogeneous food) then you won't like Blue Smoke
But if you want tasty ribs and a fun atmosphere this is the place
We've had a great time each time we've been there (with different friends)
Definitely worth trying and definitely better than most of these negative reviews
We loved Blue Smoke when it first opened but now find it like going to a strip mall in the suburbs
Food is OK but the bartenders, once really nice, are rude and quite full of themselves
In fact, go to the corner Chinese restaurant and get the ribs that come free w/ every order over $10
I gaurantee they are better ribs than Blew Smoke
There was no meat on the bones! BBQ Chicken was horrible also (dry, no meat)! On the flipside, the sides were damn good (homemade BBQ Chips, Hush Puppies, and Sweet Potato Fries) and the pulled pork was excellent
Because of all the rave reviews, I thought that I was in for a treat
Unfortunately the ribs which are the only reason for my going to any bbq style restaurant seemed old
They were not fresh at all
The sides were awesome but I love ribs and I am constantly trying to find the best in the city
these were definitely not the ones
we did not enjoy the food at all
dry oversalted robs!
One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had
These were the worst ribs I have had
period
If they have supposedly improved I would have hated to be one of the first to try them
They need to go back to the drawing board, or better yet, just board it up
Let me start by saying that the atmosphere is great and the service is acceptable (rather slow), but the food is absolutely terrible! I went with several friends and we tried the ribs, and the brisket
The ribs were tough and tasteless, but compared to the beef brisket they were outstanding
First the brisket arrived cold
When we alerted our server they took them back and apparently microwaved them
they returned piping hot and OVERDONE! They were well done, very dry, but now they were hot
This was my worst dining experience in my 3years in NYC!
Cool place for a Saturday night
We went without a reservation and were told that the wait was 1
5 hrs, but were sat in a half hour

We only ordered apatizer since we were not turned on by the menu
kangeroo
snail, venison
It was not very good
We decided to get out of there and go to a safe place with bigger portions and normal food
Entered hungry left hungry
We made a smart move of leaving
Please read the menu on their website first! Dont be fooled by the dcor
This place has been recommended to me by so many friends and I finally took my new fiance to Public for a night of delicious food and celebration
My expectations were very high and everyone one of them was met! The food was delicious- there were some flavor combinations that were out of this world and the staff were perfect: professional, knowledgable and warm
I cant wait to go back!
My girlfriend recently surprised me for my birthday and took me to dinner at public
She had been there a few times and has mentioned that she wanted to take me there
I was so happy she did
We consider ourselves foodies and wow, the food was amazing
I had the grilled scallops with an amazing sweet chili sauce- grilled perfectly and such juicy scallops
I had the roast duck as a main course and it was perfect
Juicy and perfectly cooked with a delicious chorizo mashed potato and some onion-licorice chutney divine!!! i could go on about the food, but the service needs some mention as well
It was such a pleasure being served by such an attentive, knowledgeable and friendly staff
I am very happy my girlfriend took me, we will definitely be back!!
I've never been treated so shabbily as I was at this restaurant
After waiting an hour and a half to get a table, we noticed that the hostess -- who had been rude from the moment we stepped foot inside -- had begun to seat all other parties before us
When we brought this to her attention, she brushed us off
The manager was equally rude and dismissive
We would have been content with a simple explanation or So sorry for the inconvenience
It was only when we mentioned that there were influential journalists in the group that the manager seemed to sit up and take notice
That's totally unacceptable -- not to mention, too little, too late -- and we took our business elsewhere
I won't go there again - and I won't recommend it to anyone else
My boyfriend and I dine at Public pretty much 3 times a month
We love the service and food
The wait staff is so attentive and helpful with wine selection and any questions about the food
I also love their brunch
It is the best in the city
This was the best meal that I've had since moving to NY a year ago
We started with the kangaroo and the watermelon salad
The kangaroo and falafel made an amazing combination, and the watermelon salad was a refreshing choice for hot weather
For my entree, I chose snapper and it didnt disappoint! It was done perfectly- the broth was what really made it spectacular
For dessert, I had chocolate clove mousse w/cinnamon marshmallow and graham cracker
The clove paired with the chocolate was delicious
The wine list was nice- we had a New Zealand Savignon Blanc that complemented the food nicely
The atmosphere was stylish- not pretentious, and we were seated promptly (we had a reservation)
While the servers were informative about the menu, they couldve been slightly more attentive
If you are with a large group, there's a private room off to the side
Overall- great dining experience
I have never been treated more rudely than I was by the hostess and the manager of Public for brunch last Sunday; the hostess was arrogant, despicable, and mean to our party (reminder: she is a hostess in the service industry)
We were scolded every time we politely asked her royal highness the restaurant hostess about the unreasonable wait (90 minutes)
We got there at 11 AM to get priority seating for a large table (8), yet the hostess rolled her eyes at anyone who approached her and was extremely rude and snappy
She subsequently lied about her behavior in front of her manager
Even worse, no one apologized for the terrible attitude
My party was an attractive, successful group of young women with plenty of money to spend, and and we'll be taking our business elsewhere!
I went for dinner with a group of friends
I have had mixed experiences at this restaurant in the past but this time it was utterly horrendous!!! The food was mediocre at best, the crowd and atmosphere was touristy and lackluster, and the service was appalling! The New Zealand fare is uninspired and extremely overpriced for the extremely tiny portions
Two of our entrees were moderately cold when they came out and the staff attitide was so bad we were afraid to even send it back for fear of what they might do! If you are looking for a cool space with fabulous food and great service, I'd head down the street to Peasant instead
I have been a loyal fan of Public for over a year-but have never made it for brunch
Fortunately last week I had brunch there with a few friends from out of town and everyone was thrilled
I had the most amazing watermelon salad to start and then had a delicious banana stuffed French toast
The service was great too-as expected
Your brunch wont be the same if you dont try one of their bloodys- could be one of my favorites in the city
I am now a huge fan of Public for dinner AND Brunch!
can't believe this place can exist offering such awful service
seemed to be one or two wiaters on the floor during saturday brunch
hostesses were appalling, snotty and rude
we were a party of 6 and all agreed we'd NEVER return
too bad, beautiful room - real potential
We had a reservation and waited for our table for an hour
Food was horrible! I do not recommend this place! Small selection on menu
I took a friend of mine to Public for a going away dinner
We got there at 6 pm when it first opened and were the first ones there
By the time we left it was packed
I was worried that such a trendy place might not have great food but the scallops were delicious and the prawns are fabulous!! I can't wait to go back and get them again - I have never had shrimp that were that tasty
Also, the hocus pocus ice cream was recommended by the waiter and it was the best ice cream I've ever had
The service was ok, not great, but nothing to really complain about - but who cares - as long as they bring me those shrimp again I'm happy!
Great ambiance
The bartender was absolutely lovely and helpful
mojitos weren't too sweet and just right
Great place for dates
Sexy fireplace lounge is a great hangout to talk and chill
Only con was the hostess who handled the phones did not know her directions--know your south from your north sweety!--Had trouble finding the place because of that but was pleasantly surprised by the great time I had
I had a plesant dinner there
Food tasted good and the Mojitos were great! I thought the food was a little too complicated, but very creative
I loved the restaurant
It's very trendy yet not so pretentious
My bf and I tried Kangaroo meat, venison, scalope and avalone dishes
I also wanted to try the boar meat but they were out so I had the duck
I thought their appetizers were better than their main dishes
Try the Kangaroo and scalope dishes
they were really good
It was definately an experience! Matre d was very accomodating but waiter was a typical NYker who lacked smiles
We love this place
Food is so good and everything is pretty unique
Well-presented and good sized portions too
Staff was perfect - Not to pushy and still attentive
Will definitely continue to return!
I was expecting more
but the arrogant hostess, who was unwilling to seat a table of 3 whose 4th was running late, but yet decided to sit a table of 10 with only 6 people, seemed arbitrary and unjustified
The food was merely passable
The space is incredible and very interesting, but the waitstaff are in urgent need of manners
I had a 12
45 reservation with opentable which I was informed would be respected even though they didn't accept reservations via opentable for brunch
My reservation, however, was made for that time on opentable

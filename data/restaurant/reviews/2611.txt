I've been going to Dan's on the Upper West Side for dinner for many years
I've never been able to find a lunch place in the midtown with the same quality and service, until now
Thank you Raku no more fusion
I've eatne in many Sushi Bars around the city and have found this little place to be right up there with the best of them
Although it's small, the service is great and the prices are more than reasonable
Myself and a date ate there recently for les than $100, which most restaurants, based on the amount of food we ate would easily top $150
In fact I've already been back since I was there last week
That's how good it was
I saw a small ad in Where magazine and decided to try this place before the theatre
Although small, the food and service was so great I just had to let everyone know
I will surely be back soon
I never had sushi this bad in my life
I ordered toro (fatty tuna), and they gave me regular tuna and charged me the price of a toro
The hamachi was not fresh at all, in fact, it was almost like rubber
The sushi was over-priced
It's about $4 per piece
So if you want two pieces, it's easily $8
This is even more expensive than Blue Fin, the restaurant at the W with the exception that Blue Fin was better
A very good Japanese restaurant for someone hoping for a break from touring Time Square (why would anyone want a break from that
) Good, if not incredibly imaginative food, and pleasant service, as well as ambience
Not too expensive
Absolutely wonderful
It has been forever since I have recieved such great service
And the food was incredibly fresh! Chicken teryaki, to die for
The dinner box is the ticket
Perfectly timed courses, by attentive yet not too puch servers
Definately a Find!!!!
happened to find this Japanese place through City Search
Good, fresh sushi at reasonable midtown prices, whch is rare
The service was frendly and excellent
Great spot for a date, the atmosphere is very intimate
I was very impressed with the quality of the sushi and the fresh fruit dessert was quite good
Whether you're getting delivery for lunch or going out for a romantic dinner, this place is awesome!
What a nice surprise I had when I ducked into Raku for a pretheater meal
Excellent speedy service, good prices and the Chef really spent time with us making suggestions off the menu and essentially preparing exactly what we wanted
I've since ordered the take out and it was just as good as eating in
I'll go to Raku again in the future before my next broadway show
Good little place (and i mean little) to have lunch, maybe pre theater dinner
Food is OK, won't blow you away or anything
Because of the small space though, try not to sit next to the sushi bar, sometimes you get a real strong fishy odor eminating from there
Other than that, good for what it is
I would go there again (given the fact that there are virtually no other choices of sushi around that immediate Times Square area)
I love sushi, but I'm not terribly adventurous with my choices
I went to Raku thinking that I would get my usual combination of tuna and salmon pieces
Instead, I tried the white dragon roll and the luxury eel roll and could not have been happier - everything was so fresh
Also, the chef sent over a specially made combination of seared tuna , scallop and wasabi mustard wich was incredible
The service was very prompt and friendly and the staff can answer any questions you might have about the menu
The atmosphere is relaxed and cozy - it's a good place for dates or a get together with two or three friends
Last but not least, there are enough choices on the menu to satisfy even non-sushi eaters
My friend and I discovered Raku last week, and what a find! The lobster miso was fantastic! The sushi was very fresh and the eel and avocado roll was out of this world
The staff was very friendly and attentive
The owner even stopped by to see how we were doing several times
talk about service! I would highly recommend Raku to anyone looking for great sushi at affordable prices
I'll definitely be back!
My friend and I went to Raku this past week and LOVED it
I have found myself dreaming of the Lobster Miso Soup since we left the place! If you're a sushi fan like we are, you'll love the inventive rolls and the freshness of the fish
It's a cozy little place, and the staff and owner are unbelievably friendly
Ray, the owner talked to us for a while and was very welcoming! I highly recommend
Raku is a place that has earned my return visits
The service and food was wonderful
I was delighted with the personal warm feelings inspired by the articulated wood decor and attentive hosts
If you havent visited yet, you owe yourself the treat
Tucked just off of frantic Times Square, Raku makes a great little hideaway from the madness
Cozy, VERY friendly place for some really delicious food
GREAT donburi, GREAT sushi, delightful desserts and GREAT personal service
Enjoy a night of good food and sake with friends in a place that immediately feels like home
A definite must-return!
This is a wonderful little restaurant, right near Times Square
You would barely notice it walking by, but it's definitely worth keeping an eye out for
Perfect for a nice quiet dinner, in a relaxing hassle-free environment
The owner actually took the time to walk around to each table and ask how everybody was doing, and inquire about the food
He definitely made us feel comfortable and gave the place a feeling of being your own little getaway
Oh yeah, the food was also great!  I would recommend this place to friends
we were just walking on 47th st and came upon this place
the restaurant is small and cozy, just perfect for a couple or small group
we got a booth and ordered
we were so pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! we ordered all these special rolls from the sushi chef and it was wonderful
never had such good uni or white tuna! we have recommended this place to our friends and would definitely advise theater goers to try this place
one never knows what one will find on the side streets of manhattan!
The food here is amazing
The atmosphere seems a little suburban but it is totally worth it
If you cant get into Mexicana Mama go here!
We made a 5:15 reservation so we could make a show
We were greeted very nicely, but the experience went downhill after that
The Calamari was so salty we needed more water, which did not arrive
The food was adequate, nothing to write home about, but they served tea water heated through a coffee maker
Not much is worse than coffee flavored tea
Although there were many empty tables they seemed determined to get us out within 45 minutes
Plates were removed while the person was still chewing the last morsels
When the bill came the prices were marked up from the menu from $
50 to $1
00 for many items
A glass of wine on the menu was $6
00 and appeared on the bill at $6
50
The inflated prices only added a few dollars to the bill, so just left less of a tip
I selected this restaurant because of the online menu and the proximity of it to the theater
We were greeted by a rude you're late comment when we mentioned our reservation and got an attitude from the hostess the whole time we waited
Once we were seated, we had to ask for bread plates (not to mention bread!), water (twice) and serving utensils
The prosciutto mozzerella appetizer was terrible

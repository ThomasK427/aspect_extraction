The wait staff is well trained on how to encourage/ demand that you order more expensive extras without clear explanations of price details
Don't expect good suggestions in terms of size of extras needed
We had so much pricey excess food left over it was clear they were more distastefully interested in increasing their tip
Be very careful with the wine! The not so bright  staff suggested an overpriced and not so great $450 bottle of wine to one of my friends who's got more knowledge than most sommeliers
We selected a much cheaper option but again watch out apparently you have to tell them in advance if you're not interested in having all-you-can-drink of the selected wine
On purpose, it wasnt clear when/if new bottles had been opened
This was one of my worst dining experiences ever and I am from NYC, worked in the restaurant business for years
First let me just say that the food was not all that
In fact my friend I were shocked with each passing dish and that's just what they did, pass us by
Food was just so-so
The pasta was overcooked, very mushy
The veggy dishes were loaded with oil
The chicken was dry
We were rushed at each course and 4 different people came to clean my plates with fork in hand
The only thing decent was the wine and thankfully we had that to get us through this experience
We could not wait to leave!
I cannot believe that some of these reviews for English is Italian are possitive
My experience here was subpar
Sure the wait staff was nice and ambiance very trendy and clean, but the food was horrible! Let me say it again, horrible! I live in NYC and take great pride in dining out a lot, but what is with this place? $39 per person gets you a fixed tasting menu which consists of mediocre conventional ingredients that are used over and over again
For example; upon sitting down we were served three vegetable pate's one of which was mushy green peas which later also appeared stuffed in our ravioli
GROSS! Also making recurring appearances were tiny mushrooms and tomatoes
Like I said simple food meant to be enjoyed by simple people
Manhattan has so many wonderful restaurants, this is not one of them
Finally a restarant in nyc that gets it right
I have been to the restaurant three times and everytime it gets better and better
The food is outstanding, how can you go wrong with so many choices of flavors and preparations
I recently took a large group of women and let me say having no menu takes all the stress out of the evening
Fun atmosphere
Can't wait to go back
The concept sounded intriguing
We went to celebrate our anniversary and arrived early
The place was empty
Intimidated by the dirth of patrons, we decided to be seated anyway
What an experience
First, because we were the only ones there (the place started filling up afterwards), we had the entire staff waiting on us - as if we rented out the place for ourselves
The food was incredible
To the amusement of our server, I wrote everything down, lest I forget a single morsel (about 21 different dishes)
With our drinks, we could have certainly been done after the antipasti
We were warned to pace ourselves
Although not inexpensive ($165 complete), it was so enjoyable, we swore we would take friends and relatives there
Next time, though, we will forgo the 3 course menu and stick with two - there is way too much exquisite food
But what fun!
English Is Italian has an amazing array of delicous and savory cuisine that will please everyone in your party
The ambience is very hip, comfortable, and welcoming while the decor is beautiful and edgy, even in the bathrroms! A must see, hear, taste and smell!
I had a party of 30 there recently and despite other people's reviews, I thought they did an excellent job in catering to my group
The food was great, the service attentive and the space is as good as it gets
$39 for essentially all you can eat of good food is a pretty good deal in my opinion
I seriously liked the space and concept and take no pleasure in saying this, but the food was borderline inedible
Everything
It was embarrassing
Great for groups!!! Fun idea of meal sharing, although the portions are tasting menu size (but you can get more of anything that you particularly like)
we did ask for, and got, more of a lot, and it was all good
No complaints other than the wait for the check
(and the $1 kinds menu always helps)
I've been twice and only upstairs for drinks and the bar menu
Their pizzas are actually quite good and they have a wonderful cheese plate and antipasta spread; of course, the room looks great
The place is pricey and the staff is some of the worst in the city-a bad combo
We had a birthday party there and the waitress starting bitching that we had too many people and can only start two tabs, any more would, confuse her Ironcially, none of us had a problem with this, two of us gave our cards
She bitched some more, Well, who's on which card, where we repeatedly told her, don't worry about it, we'll figure it out
It was as if it was her credit card down
Not a bad place for quick drink and few apps, do not come here with a group-waitstaff is too incompetent to handle it
If you are one of those people who don't mind paying (around $300 for two) for trendy decor while getting less then average food this restaurant is for you
But if you expect value for your money, skip this restaurant
It is a shame that for beautiful restaurant such as this with head chef who is known (Todd English) falls back to the end of the list of places to visit
I really hope that the management changes their business concept before going out of business
Visited this restaurant for the second time
This time with my husband and boy was i disappointed
My initial experience was wonderful, but not this one
Service was horrible! Food arrived cold
Helpings were alot smaller this time around
drinks were the only thing that was good
Will not be returning anytime soon
I tought it was too good to be true the first time around!
Bring your date to this place if you want to impress him/her
While the food is slightly above average, the decor and atmosphere is top notch
For $39/per person, you really can't find a better deal else where
Although not included in the set price, dessert is a must here
They're so delicious!!
The meal and experience I had recently at English is Italian was one of my worst dining experiences
The service was horrible, the food terrible and it was expensive
A very bad combination
Their new style of all you can eat is: They bring barely enough food for the table, mostly just bread ,until you ask a waiter to bring some more
That is if you can find a waiter, who seem to become as sparse and lousy as the food when you need them
The pastas were served cold, 20 minutes apart and then we waited 1/2 hour for the main courses
They brought 4 pieces of chicken for a table of 11! It was offensive
With so many great restaurants to eat in New York, at every price level, this one is loser
I was there with a large party on a slow Monday night, the set-up of the restaurant should have been great for a large group
But the experience was terrible, the service was terrible (often waiting 20-30 minutes between courses), much of the food arrived cold, and the food that arrived warm was fair at best
The worst part about the experience, when we spoke to the manager after the meal, he was defensive
This was not only one of the worst meals, but one of the worst dining experiences I have had in memory
My co-worker and I went to try the restaurant's week Lunch Menu
Decor is great, FOOD are EXCELLENT
The poscuitto panini is fillling, but not stuffing
The Hazelnut ganuche torte is rich in coco flavor!!! Bascially every dish is just made perfect! I would definitely go back and give dinner a try
Just went there last night
Made reservations at the last minute and they couldnt have been more accomodating and the place was jammed
The menu is way different than anthing we have been used to as you order a 2 or 3 course pre-fix and they bring you what seems like 100 different types of food
For a good practical joke bring someone who is anorexic here
:) For those who are very lactose tolerant like me the mozzarella was fantastic
We didnt care for the bread but that was it

The restaurant had a light, airy feel, surrounded by windows, perfect for warm summer nights and excellent for people watching
yay! fleet week! I would definitely go back
I finally had the opportunity to go to Agave and it definately lived upto my expectations
Great atmosphere
Our waiter Doug gave me a great recomendation of the blue corn enchiladas, these were so good as was the passion fruit margarita
I came here with a small group-about 5 people
The food was so good! So was the service! The atmosphere was also great
how could you ask for more? I recommend the braised beef enchilada
mmmmm!!
went to agave last sat for a quick meal before the theatre
but w/o a res i was out of luck
seeing my disappointment at schlepping around in the rain the hostess suggested dinner at the bar and i thought sure- why not
i would never have considered it but what a pleasure
met two equally soaked couples and the bartender tanya
we discussed haas avocados, mole sauce and the perfectly marinated chile
so good i was late for my show
How come I'd never heard of this place before
It was recommend by a co-worker and when I got their the place was booming for happy hour
What a great atmosphere
The margaritas took me on an instant vacation, and although there was a bit of a wait for a table, the food was well worth it
Fresh and I really loved the recommendations
I only wish I could have gotten a table in the outdoor cafe but the inside was really sexy with all the candles
Can't get that crab dip out of my mind
Fun and Yummy!
While the food was tasty, the service by the place's oh-so-beautiful staff was unforgivably slow during the seating process even with reservations but turned strangely hurried as we were rushed through the meal
At one point, the table was a cocaphony of appetizer and entree plates as the servers tried to hurry us through dinner
The food was ok, but the experience really isn't worth the money or aggravation
The place is beautiful, chic and comfortable
The hostess to the waiter are courteous and attentive
The food is absolutely delicious and more then plenty to over fill your stomachs
If you go you must try the agave passion cocktail, it is to die for and the prices are just right
I think I found a new love
I took a friend here for his birthday, but the evening was practically ruined before we were even seated
We had a wait for our table, so we headed to the bar for a margarita
Fortunately the margaritas were good because I have never met a ruder bartender
He is one of these people who thinks he is above his job
Most likely an actor
He practically threw a drink menu at us when we asked for one, then acted completely annoyed that he had to ask us if we wanted our drinks on the rocks or frozen
I'm sorry, but I think that's his JOB to ask
If you don't like your job, then I am sure you're well qualified enough to get another - perhaps as a city sanitation employee? I liked the place, but because he was such a jerk, I will NEVER go back
I went here last night with another friend, I would definitely recommend making reservations, because if you do (and your whole party is present) they seat you immediately
The corn on the cob appetizer was delicious, and the carmelized pumpkin tacos were a little sweet but also very good
My friend got the blue corn crepas, which were good, but not great
This place is a good place to try for dinner, but I don't know if I would come back again for dinner because it wasn't that memorable
I do however want to try their brunch which is suppose to be amazing
I went to Agave tonight as a belated Valentine's celebration and was very, very happy
Tonight was 16 degrees outside, so the place was crowded, but not overly so
We had a nice table
Drinks were very good
The food was great
We had the guacamole appetizer -- more salad than guacamole but good
I had the ribs and the meat melted off of the bone
It was a truly beautiful thing
The ambience was nice
As I said, it was a cold night, so not all the tables were taken
The ambience, candles and soft lighting lends itself to romance
I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups, because the place is kind of small
But I will definitely be coming back
Nice experience, good but not overdone service and really tasty food
I went with my boyfriend to Agave for Valentine's Day
The menu was excellent and they had this tequila-sampling thing going on, which was fun
The sangria was awesome, and the food was amazing!! Our waiter was friendly and attentive
My only complaint is this---we had 10 pm reservations, and we were seated immediately and the place was packed
It took quite some time to bring out the appetizers and entrees
As we (and about a dozen other couples) were receiving their entrees, apparently it was time for closing because people were stacking chairs, music was being turned down, etc
And when I went down to use the restroom, the lights were off! I felt kind of rushed, and for the amount of money everyone was spending, they shouldn't have been closing up just as we were receiving our entrees
Other than that, food, service, and ambience was fabulous!!
MUST try the blue crab chipotle spinach dip and kobe beef fajitas
awesome refreshing delightful twist to a southwestern menu
strawberry margaritas with chunks of fresh strawberries
then the mexican hot chocolate w chile
WONDERFUL evening
I remember from the last time, food was very flavorful and deliciously cooked and service was awesome
However, this time was so so so disappointed in so many different levels
First, magaritas and mojitos were not good,,,last time i thought that they made the best ones, but not anymore, too sweet mojitos, mango magarita had confusing taste with great fruit juice
Second, except grilled ahi tuna, food was not as great as last summer
Third, the service was aweful, it was not, repeat, was not attentive at all
Try to get attention from servant was very hard and we were not heard at all
I was very dissatisfied with the service
Two major partsof dining out are food and service
When the food was still good, the service was not worthy of the money
I already said to couple of friends not to go back
Want to have the best time? Try Agave
The combination of Southwestern food and margaritas is Out of this world
My girlfriends and I went there for a Girlie night out and we had lots of fun
And if that wasn't enough, MIKE PIAZZA was sitting a few tables from us
We then decided to make it our favorite spot
Great place to hang out after work
The food and drinks were excellent
We had a 10 PM reservation and waited about 45 minutes for our table
When seated, the waiter service was very good - prompt and courteous
However, the food was very run of the mill and we were really starving by the time it came
The regular margaritas were bitter but the blood orange margarita of the day was good
The food was absolutely delicious, especially the chicken enchiladas and grilled salmon salad
Careful ordering the expensive house specialty guacamole though -- tasty, but be prepared for a couple of spoonfuls of yummy guac overshadowed by twice as much pico de gallo and sour cream
Margaritas taste great, but wow are they light on the pour
I ordered a Herradura margarita on the rocks, and let's just say there were more rocks than margarita
Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass
Food delivery was prompt because they weren't busy that night, but whenever our tall, lanky waiter happened to float by, he was short on words and long on stares -- almost like he was peering through a fisheye lens
Not exactly the friendly personality you would expect from someone who makes his living off of tips

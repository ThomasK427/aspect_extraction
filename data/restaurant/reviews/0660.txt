This place has a sunday brunch menu that is stupendous, not-to-mention THEY DELIVER!!! A must-hit spot for the new Harlem!!
When I first heard about Revival from a friend, I had no idea that I would encounter such a GEM!! Around the same time, I was looking for a venue to host a 30th B-day party for a good friend of mine
After encountering the private room that the restaurant has for parties, it was a no brainer
we booked the venue on the spot!! Selling points -- Excellent Food, Great Ambiance, Fantastic Service, and GOOD PRICES!! In a 5 hour event, we had great food, the opportunity to play our own music (or hire a DJ), access to karaoke and sound system, a private bar, and an amazing wait staff!! Our guests LOVED the food and were disappointed that I didn't arrange for them to get boxed leftovers
LOL
The food and service and ambience are equally wonderful
We went early for the happy hour
Terrific choice of Martinis
Then proceeded to the restaurant are, and very pleasantly surprised by the menu
Rack of lamb, splendid baked salmon, and lots of fresh, and I mean fresh vegetablews
Presentation also adds greatly to a meal, and the presentation is right on
nice looking waitress and bartender with a little french accent
i had a wonderful time
I held my office holiday party at Revival and it was great! The owners, who were readily available, worked with me on the menu and details and I was able to throw an enjoyable party within budget
The staff is very accommodating; the party space was great for my party of 55; and the food and drinks were delicious
Afterwards some people stuck around after the party for the Friday night karaoke- that was incredible
My co-workers were really impressed and had a great time
I highly recommend Revival and I will definitely return for dinner and karaoke!
We held a holiday party in Revival this past December, and I could not have been happier
The food was incredible, exactly as we had hoped
The music was rocking, people were mingling and dancing, and the ambiance was great
The best reason to go to Revival though, is the staff
Everyone was so helpful and friendly, they really wanted our event to be a great success, and it was
The location has a great Harlem feel, check out their mission and business philosophy on their website
Parking was easy, there were plenty of seating options, restrooms, coat check, projector screen, etc
for a nice classy event
Theres a beautiful bar/lounge section, and a funky dining space that has a great design aesthetic
I will certainly bring back future business to Revival (and will come by for dinner), due to their attention to detail and tasty cuisine
We have had dinner and brunch at Revival very often, which led to having a party in the Revival Lounge
OUTSTANDING! My guests are still talking about the food and service
I highly recommend Revival for all your special event needs
If you are having dinner I also recommend my favorite dish, which is seafood baked in a light filo dough
Scrumptious!
The food is great as is the service and ambience
Be sure to check it out when you are uptown!
A silent movie with a wonderful cajun/nouveau food in Harlem is something very
well,nouveau,and it really works out
The food is marvellous,i would definitelly recomend the passion fruit dessert and the raspberry truffle,the entries,even more
I liked it the both times i went and the two times i ordered takeout is that it was never crowdy,but also never empty
Definitely,a way to go
After a long and stressful day in the office, we wondered to the bar and had a mama mango martini and cocotini
It was so incredibly good! My friend and I shared the salmon wrapped scallops and the calamari appetizers
The bartender, Ashley was so charming, knowledgeable and friendly
I would highly recommend this place!
Happened to visit friend in Harlem and decided to have dinner in neighborhood restaurant
We had Crusted Chilean Sea bass and Sizzler lobster tail
Both were delicious
They also have full-page martini selection, which is worth going for
There were only two servers, considering it is good size restaurant but service was fast and courteous
I would definitely go back for sure
It's a little pricey and I don't like everything
Sometimes it's a little too rich for me
But, most of the time, I really like the food
Lastly, I'm not crazy about restaurants that take it upon themselves to add the gratuity, since I always tip very well on my own
For the most part I enjoyed my dining experience at Revival (not to be confused with the bar on 15th)
There entrees are a very interesting combination of sweet, salty and many flavors in between
The desert menu is awesome! The raspberry truffle and passion fruit puree are to die for! Everything is just right and nothing is overdone
The only thing that made the night a bit less than enchanting was the fact that the service was so slow (there were only two wait-persons)
This is a lovely calm oasis in the middle of a bustling city
I went there recently to have tea with a friend
After being happily overwhelmed by the tea selections, we each chose a special Podunk blend
I had orange mint sencha and the mint was fresh, making for a truely fragrant cup of tea
My friend had a chai blend which she loved
We both also really enjoyed the cupcakes with fluffy pink icing
The decor is whimsical and charming and the woman who runs the place was very kind and cheerful--just who you'd want running a tea shop
Don't miss this place
Today was my second time to try Podunk and I live on the block
I had had an unpleasnat experience there once before because the women who owns it was super rude and jumped on us to order or get out before we could even get our coats off
Then today, she proceeded to tell us no laptops as I was meeting old friends and wanted to show them some photos
She said Good thing I have not put your order in, since you are not allowed to have laptops in here and you should find another place That is just what we did
The biscuits are not worth the price or the aggrevation
This lady needs to chill out
I will never go back again and I hope you do not go there either
I want to recommend Podunk, but after a recent negative experience I must qualify the unequivocally positive reviews it's received! I've been a few times and loved the baked goods -- delicious and truly unique
However, the owner has been frightfully moody and possessive of her space
I stopped by recently with a friend
When we noticed it was empty we opted to go for a walk instead
I apologized and we left having not ordered anything
She shouted after us never to come back! I don't know how our decision not to eat there on this particular day qualifies as offensive (particularly since I've been a good customer in the past) but I regard her reaction as totally unacceptable
She also has a no cell phone policy (which I can respect) but enforces it, while letting obnoxious, LOUD patrons yap away at nearby tables
Amazing baked goods prepared by the charming owner
Perfect place for tea along with sweet or savory scones
My friends and I are looking forward to going back
wow, what can i say about this little haven? it's totally charming and cute and unpretentious
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade
i love it here!
This is the kind of gem you don't find often in Manhattan: an honest business based on providing the highest quality service and products without any attitude or strings attached
The savory and sweet scones are melt-in-your-mouth amazing
The cookies are way better than the ones you get in the fancy bakeries
Long list of teas to choose from
The service is efficient and cheerful
And they refuse tips! This place has tons more class than any fancy hotel's high tea
They'll even let you have the whole place for showers or private parties
This is one of those little gems you stumble upon and keep coming back
It's a tiny quaint tea salon with a super friendly owner that serves delicious fresh baked goods
The kind you wish you could still get from your neighborhood bake sale
Scones are perfectly sweet, chocolate cake is so moist it doesn't need frosting
And the cupcakes were great
I only hope they make they with chocolate frosting every day (instead of once in a while!)

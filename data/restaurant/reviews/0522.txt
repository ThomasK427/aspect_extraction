The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato
Instead of wasting your time here: SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD
Skip the boring standard of Pad Thai (admittedly not the best) and try something yummy like the Garlic Chicken
Service always comes with a smile and the prices are pretty good
Plain and simple it's bad thai food
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy
Don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door
Definitely one of the best in the city
The food is made just right with the right amount of everything and the service is great
One of my favorite places in New York
Went for fun the first time and had a great meal with a reading that was right on
These are real readings about your life, not designed to blow sunshine but tell the truth
Foof is FAB
Psychic cafe is just a pleasant place to take a couple people before/after a night of jazz bar hopping
No cover, no line
The drinks, crowd, music are all good-to-great, and Will, the waiter is probably the nicest guy in the city
I've consistently had a great time at psychic cafe, definitely recommended
Positivly a blast! good food, good service, good readings
Definitly better for small groups of ten or less
For the mind == there is no better person than your psychic
For your stomach the food is great and so is the price
Good quality, good price
as for the personalities, the front people really need some coaching
very terse, not very friendly, no smiles, no thanks
i still go there
I eat at Tono on a regular basis
The food is fresh, relatively healthy, and the price is right
I am very glad to have Tono in my neighborhood
Slimy, bad tasting, overly salty sushi
I think sushi made in a high school cafeteria would be better
Our doorman at work, Steve, told us about this tiny deli where you can get the best and cheapest sandwich in the Union Sq area, but it doesn't look too nice in there, but all they serve is Boar's Head meats
My work buddies and I tried it, and we now go there like 4 times a week
It has a certain 'cult-following appeal' to it
As you walk by, don't be discouraged by the atmosphere
You won't BELIEVE the prices, and it turns out that the sandwiches are really good
Steve also said, I get the tuna hero
It's so big that I choke on it
This little restaurant has surprisingly terrific pizza
It is a small, plain-looking place, but the pizza is consistently great
I recommend delivery
AWESOME PIZZA, GREAT SALAD! Thinking I would run into the first place I saw to grab a quick bite to eat, I came upon this small pizza joint! What a nice surprise! Now I go there anytime I'm in the vicinity, and I recommend it to everyone!
I go here at least twice a week for lunch, and the line for their mixed salads--my usual-- are always ou the door
good wraps and pizza too
very nice staff that is tipped often, which can be strange for a take-out place, but worth it
The Family Famiglia chain is well known in the US, however, this particular one has celebrity photographs and endorsements around the place like no other
I was skeptical to believe just because of its reputation that it'd have great pizza
Boy was I thinking too much
The pizza is delicious
The variety, the cheeses, the size, and the cost
Its a great place to everyday place for good pizza and a decent alternative for pricey lunches
I am impressed and will continue to come back for more slices
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded
However, it is jus too good to not praise it
By far, the best pizza in Manhattan
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out
less wait time for me!
Really
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine
All conveniently delivered right to the door
They are FAST
just had my first experience at pizza gruppo and loved it
the staff is friendly and warm and while there is (was) only one waitress, she was sweet and attentive
go for the hawaiian pizza! you wont be disappointed
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery
The food is great
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
I heartily recommend
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently
The thin crust pizza is amazing -- you can choose any toping/crate your own
The service was great as well
Not a large place, but it's cute and cozy
Not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner
We went here 2 nights in a row and love it
The pizza is fabulous - try the shroomtown (3 kinds of mushrooms drizzled with truffle oil) The caesar salad and garlic bread are also top notch
Only downfall is the room, or lack thereof - the seating is fairly cramped and the space small - but given the food, it's worth it
The first time service was great; second time - the waitresses seemed clueless and weren't paying attention to things well
Coming from someone that chooses to live by good pizza, In my opinion, Gruppo has the best thin crust pizza in the city
It is the perfect combination of fresh real mozzerella, perfectly spiced sauce and a crust so good you eat it all, even if it is off somone elses plate you don't know
You will get to know the waitstaff and delivery people by first name
They bring over your favorite beverage before you sit down and while dining you listen to a killer jukebox
Only downfall is that it is a little hot in the summer but well worth the sacrifice
I wasn't even a fan of thin crust pizza until a friend recommended Pizza Gruppos
All skepticism vanished as soon as I took my first bite
I've never had a pizza quite like it
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made
It's a weekly addiction
Crisp, light, YUM
Perfexct light meal
The crust is thin and they dont overdue it with sauce and cheese
My favorite place near my office for hangover pizza
I've only been here once, but it was very good - I had a slice of eggplant pizza
The only drawback is that it's very expensive - $2
35 for a plain slice
This place is awesome! Food is wholesome, abundant and cheap
Great lunch place but not recommended for dinner since it's very small
Been there a few times and have loved everything I've tried! Best pizza I've ever had and the prices are so cheap

this is definitely the best we have tried in along time
We cannot say whether we liked their pekoras more than their chicken soy nuggetts, their Radha Thali or their Asian Temptation, their Cheesecake or their Peach crumble pie
it was all good
The music choice is superb their wine beer list is just right to accompany the variety on the menu
Great aromatic coffee too
This place is a MUST, even for non vegetarians
Lovely atmosphere and feeling in this restaurant
My friends and I enjoyed the variety of menu selections
The Peppersteak wrap and the Soychicken tortilla are out of this world
Delicious chocolate raspberry cake and cheesecake
I really love this place and the staff is very friendly
Check it out for sure!
This is a terrific find for the vegetarian or the adventurous eater
The menu offers an interesting combination of Indian and western dishes
The home-made veggie burger is terrific and the cheesecake is to-die-for
I would highly recommend this restaurant
Went there on Saturday night with a couple of friends and I could not have been more disappointed
The food was bland as could be, which is weird because it's supposed to be known for its spices, but maybe that was just left out of the food? Our shrimp balls had this weird little dried up shrimp inside, like it was an experiment gone wrong
The pad thai was limp, not to mention had no flavor and not too many ingredients besides the big fettucini noodles
The only dishes that were good were the chicken kebob (not hard to make) and the desserts, which were rice pudding
Oh, and the waitress acted like serving us was the last thing she wanted to be doing
I am telling you if the food wasn't cheap and the bill pretty low I would've been pissed
I've read very good reviews on restaurant sites for Rice but, was severly disappointed after trying it
All the items on the menu sound very interesting and appetizing but, lack somewhat in taste
Had the butternut squash soup, house salad, chicken satay, and two other dishes
The only one I really enjoyed were the Shrimp Rice Balls
Although Rice scores low on food, the decor and attentive service are both excellent
Give it a go but, don't go in with high expectations
please do park slopers a favor and go out of business,there is not one gooed thing i could say about this restaurant, i had better srvice in my local fast food joint
This place looks like it'd be fun for a beer at the bar, but the food I ate their was very bland
I ordered a flavorless veggie burger that fell apart in my hands
The fries were ok; they were hot at least
Bartender seemed cool, so maybe I'd go back for a drink
I wouldn't bring vegetarians here
What happened? Bar Minnow started out so well and now they have sunk into the doldrums
The service has sunk to below Fast food service and the food is not far behind
Bar Minnow came out of the gate a winner -- great service, great oysters and tasty, reasonably priced food
Now, half a year later, it is stumbling -- prices have climbed markedly, food seems to be shipped in from Red Lobster, and service is just okay
Call me wacky, but when French Fries are undercooked and oversalted in one order, but tasty in the next, and lobster bisque is a gray-green gruel, I am not getting an enjoyable dining experience
To be honest, it cost $95 for two adults and a kid (including only two beers for the adults), and the only things worth eating were the raw oysters, information about which the staff was not too sure
Everything else was sub-standard
Oyster po-boy: crunchy stuff on a soft roll with some white stuff, allegedly tartar sauce
Maybe we'll try Beet and see how long that can remain good
My spouse and I had one of the worst dining experiences in recent memory
She ordered ribs which turned out to be inedible
There was no meat, It was all fat
My salad with fish had a few soggy shrimp and a few pieces of fish which seemed to be scraps
We couldn't leave fast enough
The first time my husband and I went there, both the appetizer and entreee I ordered were not available, but we had a waitress who was really on top of things
Our second visit was horrible [specifically our waitER in the front bar room]: we asked for a beer glass, never received it - had to go to the bar to ask; never asked if we'd like a second drink - my husband had to ask a female waitress who brought it; my medium-rare cheeseburger was medium to medium-well; my husband's mussels were cold; we were not asked how everything was at all
In our 4 years of marriage, we have NEVER left less than 20% - we truly value service professionals
We left $2
00
I hope the owner gets control of this situation before more people decide not to go there anytime soon
First off, let's just say, while the actual location has a homely decor and could use some improvements
It's not a location where'd I'd find myself going to have dinner
The service is entirely too slow, and I don't know if the A/C works up to par
With that being said, after being disappointed with the dine-in, and opting for the to go - VERY PLEASED
What they lack in service they certainly make up for in their food
Lunch portions are GREAT, and food taste is certainly a strong 8/10
I mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but DON'T change the portions or the recipes
For $7
95 You get a fairly large nan, two vegetables, salad, rice, dal, raita, all in large proportions (can't say for the non-veg)
Compared to the 5
95 at Minar or the 8
95 at Cafe Spice, I would say these guys are much better option for the money spent
I will certainly return as a customer, but only for delivery service
This is a great little find
The food is authentic indian home cooking and the service feels family run, attentive and friendly
Italian restaurant were there is no one single italian person working just albanian people
Is this ok?Family mafia or what?I do not like that
Dined here about a week ago with two friends
We were seated promptly for lunch, but there was only one other table being served anyway
The white sangria was good, but out of all the dishes, mine was the best
It was the chicken stuffed with plaintain and cheese
My two friends complained about the food tasting bland, and I agreed (they had the steak and the shrimp and rice)
Friendly wait staff though
Went there last Friday night with a group of 18 people, I expected so much of this place and could not wait to eat there
What a mistake was to go there, the food was horrible, it had absolutely no flavor, it was impossible to get our waiter over and the music was too loud
The worst part of the evening was the huge projector that was in the back of the restaraunt, we were right underneath it and every time we looked up that was all we saw
I will never go back there and will tell everyone I know no to
Dined here for a group lunch with coworkers
Drinks were great - loved my caipirinha! The arroz con pollo was good, not great (one coworker got the paella and couldn't stop raving, I'll get that next time)
However service was quite slow for a lunch hour
Happily, this place delivers so I sometimes order this for a not-cheap/midpriced treat
The empanadas and ceviche are excellent!
they should just be latin food not cuban food
This is not true cuban food
drinks were ok
A place for people who just dont know what true cuban food is
If you don't mind it being loud, you will luv it!!! I went there Sat
night with a group of 6 we had a great time! We had reservations when we got there we did not like where they were going to sit
We told the Host in 10 min new seats
Once we sat down the waiter came right away to take our drink appetizer order
We did have to ask for them to bring bread
The live Cuban band really can play those tamboras!!! The Sangria and mojitos are excellent! Some of the dishes we ordered was Seafood Paella, the Filet Mignon cut into a butterfly grilled chicken all of it was UMM UMM good
Overall I will def
come back! If I would change anything it would be for them to make a small dance area for people to dance
I went with a friend for some after work drinks and we ended up ordering some snacks to share
Asside from the painfully loud live music which eliminates the possibility of being able to hold a conversation, this place can cook up some good drinks and some interesting ethnic food

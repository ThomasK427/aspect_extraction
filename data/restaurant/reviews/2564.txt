I quite enjoyed my experience at Sardis but still, its average, not great
Good drinks though!
Sardi's lives up to its reputation, the service excellent, a fillet to die for and creme bruelle out of this universe
The atmosphere perfect, a perfect night after the theatre
Bravo!
After hearing about Sardi's for many years and seeing it on TV, we finally got to eat here
I made my reservation thru their website, and it couldn't have been easier
the food, service and atmosphere were outstanding
My wife and myself had one of our best dining expierences ever
A GEM!!! We surely will go back
My husband and I had dessert here after The Phantom
The dessert was beautiful and yummy
It was a quiet evening inside and not too busy
The service was very kind and attentive
We enjoyed our time here
I thought there was a reason why all these famous people come to this place
i was wrong! The food was not good at all
A real big disapointment! The French crepes were so greasy and heavy
The pasta dishes were not good at all
Definitely would not waste my time here!
I had heard of Sardi's for years and to know that I could include Sardi's in a long weekend celebration as a college gift to my son
I just couldn't pass it up
Great staff and wonderful food
great locale
We ended our trip with a fabulous time at Sardi's
Thank you!
Perfect location for theater-goers but the food was not as good as i had anticipated
the ceasars salad is made at your table -which is rare now a days - it was quite tasty - crabcakes were overseasoned and heavy - but the deserts were chocolately and satisfying
all and all a rather uneventful dining experience - nothing to write home about
THe food is terrific, the atmosphere is great
Eating here makes you feel like a celebrity becasue of all the pictures on the wall
I have never had so much fun and relaxation at a restaurant before
The best waiter ever also works there
He looks like Luke Wilson, and he is wonderful
Whenever I go back I will request him
I didn't expect to be dining almost in my neighbor's lap; the tables are right on top of each other
We went last week just because of the history
Was not everything I expected but wasn't awful either
My husband and I had dinner here last week and the food was very good
The shrimp Sardi was excellent
My husband's crabcakes were delicious as well
The service was prompt and the atmosphere festive
The food was a bit pricey, but everywhere in NY it is!
and a better value
Thsi was the WORST meal I have had in a long time - and the most expensive bad food I've had that didn't coem wiht an airline ticket
Ignore the reviews written by their PR folks
The service was unprofessional, slow, and the food coudl have been a mircowave meal
The most tasteless creme brulee I've ever had
AVOID - there are WAY better pre-theater places, like Orso, Hell's Kitchen, etc for the same price
In Short Founded as an Italian grocery in 1959 Brooklyn, this family-owned chain has since morphed into the world's largest shopping mall-based eatery, with additional locations in airports, train stations and college campuses
On-the-go diners line up cafeteria style around exhibition kitchens to choose from ready-made, New York-style pizza slices, calzones, garlic knots and Neapolitan standards, such as lasagna, chicken parmigiana and baked ziti
Most locations offer communal seating in a casual, bus-your-own-table setting
Eating at Sbarro's is no different than visiting TGI Friday's, Chili's, Outback, or any chain restaurant around the United States
However, with poor service, lackluster food at very steep prices, it becomes merely poor alternative (and bad tourist attraction) to plenty of authentic Italian places that could be found in New York
Save your money, go somewhre else
If you're a tourist, go for any place in Little Italy over this
And if you must come, go for their bunch buffet (for eggs / potatoes / sausage / bacon / fruit @ $6
95)
Such a cute little place
Great food
Great service
A must
Surprised at the simple setting and interior size
But the food was great and would visit it again - no doubt
Lots of customers for take-out and it was totally worth it!
(27 July 02) We dropped in for a late dinner after seeing a show
The waiter seemed astounded that I ordered no wine or alcohol -- just water -- with my meal
He had to repeat it to make sure that's what I meant
What if I'm an alcoholic and I choose not to drink? The service declined from there
The ambiance and food were okay, but we both felt as if the wait staff was a bit too snobbish for our tastes
And we had to wait forever for the check (with only one other group in the restaurant at the time)
A mildly disappointing dining experience
These guys at this bar are great! They treat strangers like family
One of the owners John was the nicest guy that I meet in NY
He never made a southern girl pay for a beer! How can you beat that? You Irish guys were great!! We will be back this summer
My wife and I had dinner at the Amarone Ristorante ( 686 9th Ave) while in NYC
The food and service were exceptional as was the price
Zagat rates this restaurant a 19 for food, 14 for dcor and 19 for service
I would rate the food at least a 24 and serice a 25
I agree with the dcor rating
Overall, a very good food and a very good value
I found this place to be inviting and warm but service a tad pushy
The food is tasty but nothing you can't find at other good Italian restaurants
Had the riccatto fettucine and it was good, my friend had the sea bass special and he enjoyed it too
we shared our dishes and both of us were not feeling well afterwards
Overall, I would recommend it if you are in the area
Living in the area, I can't tell how many times I have been to this restaurant, but I can say that I have never been disappointed
The food is some of the best I've found in the city;always fresh and always prepared just like Mama used to make
The wines are among the best I've ever had, especially the Amarones
Great place to take a break from the city and feel like your in a little restaurant in Italy
Amarone was recommended to some friends and I after a show
We were pretty disappointed
We were seated pretty quickly, but thats prob
bec
the place was pretty empty
The owner welcomed us warmly kissing our hands, but the food was pretty average and the service was poor
Our waitress was nice enough when you could find her, but that was a challenge
I had the tilapia special which was mushy and boring and my three friends were also disappointed in their meals
Then they brought the check without asking if we would like dessert so we went for cheesecake elsewhere
Three friends and I stopped in just to grab a quick bite before a show

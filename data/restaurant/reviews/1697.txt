There are a variety of flavours to pick from on the menu and its an awesome place to chill out with friends
They add more though like bellydancing or something like that it would make it a lot more interesting but th location is very convenient and the hookahs are pretty decent
Maybe because I went on a Tuesday evening, but I thought the service was great
Osama, our waiter, took the time to explain how hookahs worked and showed us what the tobacco looked like, since my friend and I were newbies
The hummus was the absolute best I've ever tasted
By the time we left, we were on a first name basis with all of the waiters
The patio is a great place to chill on a warm night
it might be authentic but this place is terrible
first, a hookah bar should be chill, comfortable, relaxing
i don't need the authentic chaos of cairo unless, of course, they were to charge accordingly
this place was so bad that i left well before finishing my smoke
service was terrible
went for a quick late night smoke, were forced to order overpriced drinks, deal with rude service, music so loud and tinny that it hurt, screaming underage kids
then, the nerve, they add 20% gratuity to a bill for 2 (no notice that this was their policy --- same went for their little 2 drink minimum), and when questioned about it, the waiter goes and fakes like he's asking his boss for something then comes back with one of those i'm too stupid to really be held accountable for my actions shoulder shrugs
boycott this place
The people who complain about this place, especially the service, don't get the whole picture here
This is as authentic an Arabic experience as one can get in Manhattan, full stop
Sure there are trendy places where art students dressed in black can smoke shishas to look cool, but Sahara East isn't for them, it's for people who want a touch of Cairo in the East Village
And that means chaotic service, lots of messy food, and when crowded, tables on top of each other
Let the trendoids and fashionistas go elsewhere, Sahara is a truly cultural experience
This place is good go there and try the tootie fruity hookah it will b worth it i could sit there for hours
it's a great place to go, it gets very busy on weekends, but it's a fun place and you get to meet all types of people
The hooka is very good, and the overall experience is a good one
Brace yourself for a real juxtaposition
The food was excellent: hummus that was so smooth and creamy it was like eating melted velvet; firm and flavorful falafel, fresh and vibrant tabouli salad
BUT the service was some of the worst I have ever come across -- EVER
My meal came well before my companion's and I had to ask three separate times and march back to the kitchen before I eventually got it
Our waters were never filled either
While amends were made with complimentary desserts (which were fantastic), I will not return
I was so disappointed with the service that I did not even stick around for a hookah session, which was pretty disappointing, but I wasn't going to spend another dime there
So, you are forewarned: Brace yourself
My roommate and I come to Sahara East not for the food or even the hooka--though the latter, which comes in around twenty amazing flavors, certainly helps--but for the lively atmosphere of wonderful waiters who dance with tambourines, customers who try out bellydancing skills, Egypt's top 40, and NYU students, always good for amusement
I would recommend against the falafel and the egg dishes, though I have been told that most of the chicken dishes, particularly the various kababs, are excellent
The Egyptian, non-alcoholic beer is wonderful
The wine/beer list is a little limited, but they carry the most popular varieties
It's easy to find: go to the 1st Avenue L stop, and walk two short blocks away from Beth Israel Medical Center
Look for a yellow hooka flag
Overall, a wonderful experience, but not exactly a place to take your parents
A shisha lover at heart, I really enjoyed my experience at Shara East
There are small tables in the front that give way to a simple, NO frills but, perfectly charming backyard setup
The tables are a little packed in but, I feel like it gives the place character as everyone is smoking and enjoying the shisha together
The people are mixed with some young some old
The hookahs are not the best as we our shisha was pretty harsh before a waiter came around and cleared it
Contrary to what another review said, I thought the service was excellent and attentive
It's a place with a lot of people packed in; the waiters are obviously trying the best they can
Go there when you don't want to deal with the chaos of clubs and chill out
My favorite French Bistro in the city
We live in the W
Village but trek east for the lovely and affordable food at least once a month
The wine list isn't particularly extensive, but includes some fabulous wines for reasonable prices
A new chef has recently taken over, and I won't say the food has improved, but it has certainly lived up to the standard set before his arrival
The ambience in the evening cannot be beaten (dim lights, lively music) and the servers hustle and aim to please
It seems like everyone who walks through the door is a regular and I can see why
My husband and I have also taken in brunch and lunch here
The eggs benedict are stellar and the bloody mary's may well be the best in the E
village
Lunch here is very affordable and they even have wireless internet
Don't miss it!
You always know what you'll get here
The food wine are fresh and delicious and very inexpensive
Great music
J'adore
The food is really good
It's a good place to have brunch, but for dinner it's a bit too noisy
With all the doors open and a view of playing kids in Thompson square park we sat down in de flea market to celebrate my friends final graduation
The food was nice and reasonable, and we were served by an army of young energetic ladies, smiling, and slightly dancing even
When it got colder and darker the doors were closed and the place turned into a cosy, romantic cafe
It was just very nice, next time I'll take my girlfriend
THE SERVICE WAS FINE, THE FOOD WAS OK
THE FRONT DOORS WERE ALL LEFT OPEN DESPITE A TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR AND COLD WEATHER BUT WE BRUSHED IT OFF
OUR BILL WAS $92, WHICH WAS FINE AND WE LEFT A $20 TIP FOR THE WAITRESS, WHICH WAS ABOUT A 22% TIP
ON THE WAY OUT, SHE STOPPED US AT THE DOOR TO ASK IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE, AS SHE THOUGHT THE TIP WAS INFERIOR
MY FIREND, WHOM I WAS TAKING TO DINNER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, WAS AFRAID I HAD MADE SOME MISTAKE, AND QUICKLY GAVE THE WAITRESS ANOTHER TEN, WHICH SHE WAS HAPPY TO TAKE, RESULTING IN A 33% TIP
EITHER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, THE EAST VILLAGE IS STILL FULL OF TRASH
the flea market carry a great selection of french chesse cheese that change on daily base, a bargain, $14 and the wine list is riche, my favorite the PIC ST LOUP and RIOJA
the staff is super friendly and all the girls are cute, it's just perfect place for spring time
and the brunch is a killer, great waffle, egg benedicts and now got a bloody marry or mimosa for $3
50, just can't get enough of the place
After waiting forty minutes for our brunch, learned that the waitress had -- oops! -- lost our order
She apologized profusely, and promised that our food would be out in two seconds
Fifteen minutes later (despite her promises, she clearly had merely put our orders in the queue), it arrived
We (naturally) asked for a discount when the bill came, and our waitress disappeared for a moment and offered us
one cocktail of our choice! We asked to speak to the manager
he came out to offer us -- oh, did our waitress say a drink? Well, maybe not a drink, but if we move to the bar (we need the table), we could have a dessert! Well, we're pretty full, we'd just like to lea-- oh, okay, thanks for coming! He disappears
So, we won't be going back
Which is a shame, because we quite enjoyed the food
They have the best eggs benedict and hash browns
Although the restaurant is always crowded and you are elbow to elbow with the people next you it is definitely worth it
This is a great place to eat
The food is always good, the waiters are friendly, it's affordable
But this is definitely not the place to go if you're in a rush
Everything on the menu is authentic and the standard is excellent
I highly recommend this restaurant for a leisurely dining experience
I also recommend their Bourgogne Passetoutgrain wine, it's wonderful
Flea Market is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
I've been going for years
The steak is delicious, as is the pate and seafood specials
Good wine list
For a french restaurant it is pretty cheap, too
Oh, and you can smoke at your table!

Close seating, but a clean, pretty place
If you make reservations, I'd ask NOT to be seated in the back room--it's dark, separated from the bathroom by a curtain/folding shade, and for some of the tables, the booth seating is lower than the chair seating--so you'll end up looking up, or down, at half your party
Perfect for 2 people--friends, or an informal date
I dined here in late January at the spur of the moment with a group of 8 friends
The food was good, great portions, and accomodated us without a call ahead
I don't recommend going near closing time, or lingering near closing time - I felt rushed to leave
Also, note for people splitting the check: they take either the whole amount on a card or cash - no splitting up smaller amounts on various cards
The food is fine when you're eating at the restaurant, but if you order sushi take-out, you risk the chance of getting the poor cuts of fish they wanted to get rid of
Food here is always fresh tasty! The staff always efficient friendly
Great Value! Their ginger dressing - YUM! Their delivery is great too! The back room is more romantic
The decor of the restaurant and the service were nice but for the price, the quality of sushi was very diappointing
The mackerel had a bit too much vinegar which seemed to cover up for its lack of freshness and the octopus lacked the moist, cool intensity characteristic of fresh product
Most of the sushi served (salmon, white fish, tuna, etc) was at a palate-displeasing room temperature
For the same price, you can get much better stuff at Sandobe or Sapporo East
Unfortunately, that may not be the easiest option for Columbia students, but hey, if you want to set a standard for sushi, this Tomo may not be the best place to start
Whenever I crave sushi, I go to Tomo
The food is consistently good and very well priced
My friends and I always have a wonderful time here
The service and ambience are solid
but the food will keep you coming back! Highly recommend the Thunder Roll, Volcano Roll, Agedashi-Tofu
Always busy, so try to catch it on an off time
The Bento box on mon, tues, wed is a great deal (10 bucks) for a good amount of tasty food
Their sushi is fairly priced, and very fresh
The waiters are also surprisingly courteous
No wait usually, if anyhting 15 min
While a student at Columbia, I frequented this place twice per week
The fish is always fresh, the house salad comes with a fantastic dressing and the steamed veggie dumplings are great
The service can be inconsistent, but chatting with the waitstaff while giving your order usually results in much more attentive service
Very reasonable prices
Eaten there many times, never disappointed
Great appetizers and bento box very generous--always take some home for lunch
Great ginger salad dressing and excellent sushi
Recently tried the vegetarian sushi--excellent--will get it again! Save room for green tea or red bean ice cream--they will combine if asked
Always a very solid sushi o sashimi meal
Don't come here expecting fancy cooked meals - the delight is that they actually have great sushi
Not great presentation of some other non-sushi meal but definitely great sushi
Melt in your mouth kind of sushi
Nobooers go home
You don't eat sushi
Great Sushi at Tomo on the upper west side(Get the sushi boat)
The food makes me salivate
I come every other Sunday for the buffet
YOu can not beat it
Don't bother with those places in the village, this is the ticket to memorable indian food
Yummy Delicious Dinner Buffet at 10
95
I loved the creamy chicken curry
Unlike other Indian restaurants that use poor quality chicken and cover it with curry, all the chicken were of good quality
But I LOVED the dessert like curry flavored with coconut
Yummy Chicken Tikka
The restaurant is small and cozy
You can go inside with jeans and T-shirt and not worry about whether youre properly dressed
But the downside: unlike most buffet restaurants, the waiters do not replace your plate
You use that ONE plate to refill
I guess they dont have dishwashers staffed
as a resident of the UWS who frequently goes downtown for meals, this is a great place to go if you just want to have a nice comfy meal in the neighbourhood
Their venison (if in season) w/ polenta is excellent, and the walnut-pear frisee salad is a great constant classic
The mixed appetizer plate is great for a group of people, very yummy and fresh
Tiramisu is great, all in all good prices and solid quality
Yes, they do not take reservations or CC, but it is a nice thing to hang outside on the bench in the summer and wait a bit for the table
Nice and relaxed athmosphere, although since the opened up the bigger space a while agom it is more noisy
(but don't even start comparing this to Carmine's!!!!)
This is one place you can be sure to get a very good meal at a fair price ! I have always been impressed with their consistency across the board and highly recommend the Tiramisu, which is one of the best surprises in the city
Only drawbacks consist of their CASH ONLY and no reservations policies
also, be prepared to wait should you arrive after 7:30
I went here with a friend for dinner on a sunday night and we did not have to wait for a table
The food was really good and at a good price
They also had many specials and refilled our waters frequently
The ambience could use a lift, but its a nice place to go with friends
If you tell them that it's someone's birthday, your waitor will put a candle in the dessert and sing happy birthday
Great neighborhood Italian place
I've heard the wait it really bad though so I went with a friend at about 6pm on a Sat and there was no wait
Grilled Calamari Appetizer was amazing and the special pasta bolognese was very good as well
Had a great glass of wine for $7
Price is good overall but the specials are more than other pastas on the menu
Not my favorite Italian place on UWS but close - I'll def be back soon
And service is great but you feel a little rushed
Gennaro almost always has a wait from 7 p
m
onwards
Go before then! Food is excellent and portions are decent
Would suggest asking for specials before ordering but menu offers a good selection
Gennaro is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants on the UWS
I always enjoy the food here
Most, not all, waiters are friendly
Some tend to be a little lacking in communication skills
The lines can discourage you, but go during the week
The lamb shank, special pastas and frise salad are excellent
This Italian resturant overall had good reviews on food which I must agree but their management and service deserves 4 out of 10
When I was there with a friend the waiter who served us was pretty friendly
When we were done, another waiter came up to us and tapped my shoulder without saying Excuse me and said Are you done because we have people waiting
We were not offered the dessert menu and that waiter was so rude!~ I was very offended after a good meal
I live in Harlem and Gennaro is the closest restaurant I've found with moderately inventive, flavorful Italian food
It probably doesn't deserve the reputation it has as a sacrosanct mecca for gourmet-inclined Upper West Siders, but it is a decent value in a restaurant-challenged neighborhood
With that said, the wait is often unmanageable and the interior noisy and crowded
The appetizers are tasty across the board but the entrees are, more often than not, uninspired
The service is warm, if a bit rushed, and the ambience is fine if you don't mind involuntarily eavesdropping on your neighbor's conversation
All in all, Gennaro is good for the neighborhood but pales in comparison to better Italian restaurants downtown
It WOULD be cheap, if there wasn't a $20 minimum per person! But the food was excellent (how could it be cheap, when it tastes this good?)
The goat cheese, portabella tart is AMAZING

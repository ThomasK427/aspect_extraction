it'd be nice if we got to see the actual dishes
The Scene  Inspired by nearby Clinton Street's newfound status as a culinary destination, a different breed of Lower East Side restaurant is popping up faster than you can say "Wylie Dufresne
" Among this new school is Azul Bistro, which brings South America to Stanton Street, with seduction-ready dim lighting and soft tango music
The Food Azul's focus is on the food of Argentina, but other South American standbys like ceviche and empanadas appear on the menu too
A beet and avocado salad simply dressed with an herb-infused oil shows off late summer's bounty nicely, but the skimpy size is a little disheartening
Good entrees include lamb as well as steak frites with garlicky chimichurri sauce, but the sea-salt-baked trout is just that: salty
Stick to drinks like the tart watermelon sangria, or go straight for dessert
The creme brulee with dulce de leche is silkier than a slow jam and big enough to share
They should be Spanish ecleptic new extravaganza cuisine,not argentinian
This is not argentine food
A place for customer ,who just does not kwow what aargentin food is
These owners are AMATEURS
If you like good food and good service do not go to Azul, Is not the place to have a nice dinner
The service is not better and the price it is expensive
Not recomended
I went to Azul and i really can tell is not recomended place to have a nice dinner
The waites are not friendly and the push you to live even if you do not finish
The food is below average
In my opinion not recomended
Relax about the service, its a little spot on the LES, run by kind of ditsy, cute Latin girls
No one at Azul has ever been rude to me
On the contray, the hostesses are always so nice that it doesn't seem to bother me that they are really pretty terrible at their job
The food is solid and the vibe is great
Good Malbecs on a reasonable wine list
They do tend to overcook their steaks so just order really rare and they will be good
Don't go when you don't time for a slow evening
I live about 15 feet away and I am really glad its in the neighborhood
So, I often ban places if their service stinks because this is nyc and I refuse to give money to places that have bad service and make the owner rich, rich, rich! But this place I can't seem to ban
I love the food! The skirt steak with the chimmichuri and mashed potatoes is to die for! However, I have been here about 15 times so far and the service has been horrible each time!  You are constantly seated in the worst seat, reservation or no reservation! If you request a seat you will be denied and that seat will remain open for the length of your stay
You will be greeted with rude servants and a rude hostess! You will be lied to about seats being reserved for other people when you make a reservation yourself and it seems like you are just being seated as any other walk in would
People will be seated before you who came in after you, without reservations! And you will be rushed through your dinner
The last time I went there my friend literally was playing tug of war with the waitress and our dessert plate! If the food wasn't so good this place would be Banned for sure!
Regarding the appetizers, I'd get the empanadas, the beef one was outstanding, best empanada I've ever had, the cheese one was good but more pedestrain
Did not try any other appetizers
Beef is the only way to go at this place
The other offerings are really there to allow for people in a party who don't like beef
We had the Marinated grilled and sliced Sirloin: outstanding
Steak purists might not like it because it has been marinated for 24 hours so it has a lot of flavors along with the beef
We all found it outstanding
The best dessert was this crepe filled with caramel (not sure of the name) Service was decent
I did not experience the bad service other talk about on this site but looking around at how busy they were I can see this happening
Everyone should remember also that beef quality is not uniform
You can go to Luger's and have a bad steak (not often)
Ours was outstanding last night but when you order steak you are rolling the dice, because not the butcher, the buyer, nor the cook can tell you with certainty that a particular steak will be good
This place is decorated with alot of stuff that has to do with argentina until they bring you out the food
call me crazy but isnt meat supposed to be tasty?the service makes you feel like they really dont want you there
the prices are reasonable but if i want reasonable ill go to Mc Donalds and ill get a better burger too
I dont think ill come back
This place is adorable and has such a great Latin vibe
That being said if you're looking for great food and service, this is not the place for you
Goat cheese salad had about an oz
of goat cheese (but they did bring more when I asked!)
Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks
My trout was swimming in salt
BUT!! The vibe in this place is great - great music, staff is very friendly, local crowd, and you feel a little like you're in upscale Mexico
My friends and I had a great time here on a Tuesday night and by 9:30 the place was hopping
This is a great place for a lite dinner and casual drinks - nothing gourmet
P
S
they only serve wine beer so plan accordingly
Hi all,   I've been there a few times and the food is always great! The truth is that the service is POOR and not well-trained
I recommed the provolone as a start and the cortada is DELICIOUS!! If you don't want to spend a lot of money in a dinner, don't go there
I bring all friends, business associates, and relatives to Azul for dinner because the food is consistently amazing and we always have a great time
The cuts of meat are fantastic and my favorite are the mashed potatoes, soo good
The waiters are extremely nice and they already know that I must have the dessert every time I go, they are incredible, especially the flan
Look up at the ceiling when you go, it's quite an eyefull
Azul practically specializes in steaks, but somehow the two that we tried were really bungled
I started my meal with a lovely Tomato and Bread soup - a potent and salty creation with chunks of fresh tomatoes and bread cubes
I was off to a great start
Unfortunately my shell steak was not nearly as good
The cut iteself was odd, with very thin ends and slightly thicker center; and the meat was overcooked, a medium-well, as opposed to the medium-rare I asked for
My friends had the sirloin for two, which had too many gristly bits and was also overcooked
Oh well, there're plenty of places to get good steaks in the area
I just went to Azul for the first time the other night
It was fantastic! The food and wine were both outstanding and well priced
We had a big group and they had our table ready for us when we got there because we had reservations
The service is very European - they only come around when you need something and more importantly, they leave you only to enjoy the company of your friends
If you like a server who is constantly over your shoulder and there for your every need, this is not the place for you
The atmosphere is fun, open and noisy when it gets crowded
I will go back over and over
We made a 10pm reservation on a Saturday night
No one greeted us for 10 minutes, however our name were in the reservation book
As we waited, we were able to watch the chaotic mess of service unfold
The tiny bar was not serviced1 of 2 waiters would randomly jump back and tend bar
When a 2-top finally opened up and it was our turn, the disorganized 'host' sat a couple who had come in AFTER us with NO reservations!! I had to run after him, making a scene, telling him it was unacceptable after a 40 minute wait--and that he had to ask the couple he seated to get up and give us the table (he did)
All-in-all, a bad start
Although the food and atmosphere were good, the service never improved
Oh yeahand reservations? Dont bother because you wont get any priority over walk-ins
This is a lively, boisterous place with decent food and lots of atmosphere (this is the Lower East Side, after all)
The wait-staff is busy, but they make a sincere effort to pay attention to customers' needs
The steak, lamb, and potatoes are excellent, but some of the other meats are just so-so
The wine list has many decent, affordable options that go well with the grilled meat
Expect a short wait for your table, even if you have a reservation
Yummy food, cute cozy atmosphere and friendly staff
Lower east side is really pulling thru with some good restaurants
The Filet was cooked to perfection with a lovely Chimichurri sauce but if you LOVE Mash Potato this place is an absolute must
Need I say more
More Mash Potato Please!
Arrive late, stay long
Your date is going to be impressed

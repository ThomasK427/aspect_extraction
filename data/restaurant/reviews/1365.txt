Waited forever for a cappicino
took so long that i ended up canceleing it cuz everyone was done eating
The food came cold and a sauce that came with one of the dishes had developed a skin
so gross
And the waiter got our orders wrong
dont go, just dont do it
I just loved the Burgers will recommend anyone who asks for great food!!
Had the meat loaf was pretty good, my boyfriend had some kind of chicken wrap that he really enjoyed
Also had a cream of carrot soup that was really nice
We will definetly be back
We go to this place once a week with a group of about 15, food is good and the prices are reasonable
I wish they had corned beef hash on the menu though!
Went there once, food wasn't impressive at all
For some reason felt like ordering delivery tonight to give them another chance -- but
the nachos were like cardboard, the mac cheese tastes like it came from a blue box, and the chilly fries were
lets just say it looked 'very' unappetizing and tasted worse
Really want to support this place since it's jazzing up LES -- but then again
really not worth it
I saw them on menu pages first and tasted their catering during fashion week at the Marc Jacob office
I booked them for a catering on a days notice
They really saved me
The have the cutest brown bag lunch packages for my meeting
Big raves, thanks guys
Went to this place not expecting much, had a good meal and the prices are very reasonable
About time you can eat a meal in the area without giving up half your pay check
This place is a disaster
Clearly being run and operated by rookie wannabes, LoSide can't seem to do anything right
The food is of poor quality; cold potatoes and cornbread, pre-packaged ham, unwashed fruit, really unbelievable
No butter of syrup was brought to the table until after pancakes were getting cold
Our waiter actually tried to get out of bringing us the strawberries that were part of the dish because he would have to go downstairs to get them
When he finally did bring them, he also brought over a can of whipped cream to classily put on the strawberries
When we were finished, our waiter blatently didn't clear any of our dishes, and instead just dropped the check in the middle of the mess
The manager the entire time was sitting at the bar completely oblivious to the trainwreck he's in charge of
I give the place 6 months
Really liked this place, has a pretty cool look and the food and service were really good
Went with a bunch of picky eater and to my surprise everyone was happy with there meals, a hard to please bunch
Great diner grub in a nice setting will be back
Not only is the food cheap,but it is also really good
I recomend the chicken curry wrap with steakfries
I've been coming here since they opened
Food took a little long to get out at first but i have seen a huge improvement recently
Service is good, music is fun, cool art on the walls
A nice happy place to be
Hey they finally opened
had dinner there tonight
food was great
finally a diner in LES worth its salt
pretty nice decor for a diner
staff was pretty cool
just what the hood needed

in the mood for a dinner of breakfast, I ordered pancakes with a side of bacon
One friend ordered french toast with a side of bacon and another friend ordered meatballs
Only when the waitress delivered the pancakes and french toast did she tell us they were out of bacon
A diner? Ok, we switched to sausage
Nope, out of that as well
I don't know why she didn't tell us in advance so we could change our orders
On the positive side, the pancakes were ok and the meatballs were excellent
Non-restaurant people decide to open a restaurant because it just seems like the fashionable thing to do these days
Diner in the LES is a great idea but
An incompetent staff hangs around, flirting w/each other instead of serving customers
Fries were cold and late arriving at table
My friend had the steak and felt sick afterwards
The manager came over to apologize for the kitchen that kept on getting the same order wrong (we just opened last week and we're working out the kinks
isn't that what a soft opening is for?)
I also watched several other frustrated customers getting the wrong orders or trying to catch the waiter's attention (he was posing at the soda fountain)
Get it together, people!
Very accomodating staff, they worked hard to fit you in and get you to eat there, staff is hard-working and food is fantastic served quite quickly
A true diamond in the UWS ruff, which rarely can sport restaurants/bars that have great atmosphere and/or food
Great wine list, good outdoor dining, bar is not good as it's too tightly packed with restaurant
Also sadly on a pretty ugly part of Amsterdam
Service was very good
Sangria tasted a little watered down
dishes weren't spectacular
My boyfriend recently discovered this place and boy what a find!!! We have gone back 2 additional times since our first visit
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is always welcoming
Whether it is a girls night, guys night, or a romantic date this is the place to be
The sangria is wonderful and constantly flowing
The tapas are delicious, especially the artichoke hearts and octopus
Everything we ate there, including dessert, is scrumptious and extremely fresh
It is the perfect place for any occasion
If you want to have a great time and eat well I recommend this place highly!!!!
The tapas we had was just average, but the main dish specials were great! Really cool looking place
Good Spanish wine
Great service
Ask them what to order
I don't think everything on the menu is great, but there are some shining stars
We were intrested in eating Spanish food, so we walked into Sol y sombra
Just by taking a look at the place, we relized that this was a wonderful restaurant to spend our night
The food was exceptionaly great and the service as well
Although the place was packed we still had a friendly staff
I recomend that you make rezzie's though because the place can get busy
I'm not a homesick aussie, but fell in love with the world's best comfort food on a trip to melbourne
The Tuck Shop is classic australiana - and the best fun I've had in ages

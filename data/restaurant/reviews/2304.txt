The atmosphere is lovely and the staff was very warm and friendly
Only 2 criticisms - the liquor is OUTRAGEOUSLY expenseive and the courses were served to quickly
There was no need to rush since we were the last seating, but it seemed that each course was presented immediately after we finished the prior course
Slow down!
What an ufortunate(and expensive) experience
From the stuffy atmosphere to the less than professional service and the most dissapointing meal I may have ever had
The expectations were high and for the money they should have been met if not exceeded
There was an obvoius lack of management and Chef presence was non existant
Fabulous restaurantw/ a nice selection of dishes
Waiter and captain ver good
Had something floating in my wine
They gave a free bottle
I had the rabbitt and gnocchi for 1st course and the duck for entree both very good
The bread they served was a little hard the bread boy always served us across our face
Should have been a little more professional for this place, but overall a good experience
We just got married and we chose to have our first lunch in NYC after our honeymoon at this fine restaurant
The $22 prix fixe menu was worth every penny
The service impeccable if not too eager
Gary, the host, was friendly and treated you like you're royalty
The tomato soup was garden fresh and light (best I've had) and as fort the main course, the skate fish with vegetables was delightful and tasty
The only dissapointment was the desert
We both had the pana cotta which I thought was too rich with caramel
It was better than average but I wish I had the other choice
Our friendly neighboring table said the gelato creation was out of this world
I took my Fiance here for her birthday, and was not dissapointed
The atmosphere is romantic, the food is flawless, and the service was good
Our waiter was a bit snooty, but I guess he can get away with it here
Save room for dessert, each one is a work of art!
The food was spectacular, the service divine
But if you think that privacy is an important component to a romantic dinner, look elsewhere
A special occasion place
romantic
beautifully decorated
fine service
engaging staff
Four star cuisine
The $85 tasting menu
the seafood terrine, the quail-the rissotto-the scallop with foie gras-the veal pot a feu-the desserts- the sorbets-the custards
just marvelous, multi layered taste sensations
lovely, lovely
and more!
I felt like a princess
The service was outstanding, the food was out of this world, the desserts were to die for
The most wonderful experience, especially on a sub zero freezing cold night
The wine list is a high tech Palm Pilot
The Maitre D explained how to use this amazing piece of equipment
From the minute we walked in until we left was an amazing restaurant, fabulous gastronomic experience
Thank you to all the Staff
best regards the girls at  table #27
Terrible
The service was horrible and snide
The food was terrible and cold!
Upscale without being snobby, Aureole is a great experience -- and you can't beat the $20 prix fixe lunch
The food is outstanding; it's creative while being traditional
The service is on the captain system, and our captain was great! Very attentive staff, though we did wait a bit long for our coffee
Definitely recommend
This is a restaurant for quiet, elegant dining without the hoopla and fanfare associated with the latest in joint
I'd dined at Aureole only twice, separated by 2 months and the bartender still remembered my drink
That was just the start
Service is both informed and flawless
The tasting menus were the best I'd had in Manhattan - complex, while simultaneously avoiding the quirks many chefs add into their dishes
The wine list is delivered on an electronic touch-pad, which includes complete reviews of some of the many offerings, inviting exploration
The quiet, comfortable interior, though a bit tight, is wonderful for quiet conversation and a romantic evening out
Maybe our expectations were too high, but while our appetizers were delicious, our entrees were un-creative and bland
My broiled sole, which I chose on a server's recommendation was bland and my husband's lamb special was ordinary
We were seated more than a half-an-hour late and had to skip dessert or eat it at midnight as a result
Also, the menu on their website, did not reflect the food that was being served when we dined there
We were crammed next to the people who were seated to the right of us, who repeatedly took phone calls during dinner, while the rude wait staff did nothing despite the warning on the menu that cell phones were not to be used in the dining room
My recommendation is to spend a little more money and go to the Four Seasons for the complete dining experience
I think you pay for the service in these upscale restaurants
Because even the food is pretty good and different then everyday meals, portions are very small
I guess if you order the chef's tasting menu, which is a seven course meal with an optional wine matching for $125pp then your tummy will be well satisfied
They offer two tasting menus, one is the regular and the other one is for vegeterians
Crowd seems to be mostly Madison and Park Avenue residents and Businessmen with large expense acconts
Excellent deserts! Very impressive Wine Selection
Did the prix fixe lunch on a friday, and a truly great time
Sat for hours and enjoyd the food and the wine
Great creme brulet
Very affordable with the prix fixe
The moment I walked in, I could tell Aureole was a very posh restaurant because everyone looks like they're 60 plus and just walked out of their park avenue apartment
The hostess was very nice
She welcomed us with a big smile
The bartender was a little non-chalant
He didn't seem too happy to be there
Overall, the food was fantastic
I highly recommend the Red Snapper
I thought it was fantastic
Their portion is also pretty big for this type of restaurant
Keep in mind that you can only order pre-fixe
The only complaint I have about Aureole was the blank space at the bottom of the check for captain gratuity
We didn't leave anything
When we left, the captain was standing by the door and didn't even say goodbye
I thought that it was kind of rude because we left well over 20%
The food was beutifully presented and the deserts were out of this world
We liked the place so much that we went to Aureole in Las vegas and did'n't disapoit
The place has class and romance
The back garden was especially nice and romantic and offered a private dining experience
The food was delicious, the desserts were works or art, the setting is beautiful
Not much to really complain about, this is a special place
I did think the service was a little haughty, but it didn't get in the way

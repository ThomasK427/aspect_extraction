The Sake cleans your palate and refreshes your mouth making it ready for the next sushi roll
Next time I am in NYC I will be eating sushi at Oh Raku
Use your frequent dining card
This 'Hidden Gem' should have remained hidden! Where 2 start
Edamame overcooked, dishevelled
ruined! What a feat
Fish was clammy, with slight off taste to some(according to my sashimi-eating dinner companion)
One special roll contained 'ming leaf' - (not listed in ingredients) a member of the Geranium family, acrid and overpowering - rendering the roll inedible
Heard of Raku only via rave reviews here (we prefer Hakata or Blue Chili in midtown), ironically the 'specials' white board on the wall was highlighting the fact that they are a comprehensive 9
6 on Citysearch
Service shabby
initially debating whether to seat us at a booth whilst tables for 2 occupied (long past pre-theatre)
and debut-night waitress failed to act on our spoiled fish
Also, overheard gent at the next table complaining to the manager about his food
Was this on an off-night? Will not be returning to find out
I have been to Raku a couple of times and the food is phenomenal
The saki selection should be perused
The specials should also be given special consideration as well
let those who do not care for Raku's ambiance, menu variety superb sushi specialty rolls go elsewhere
for those of us who are fans - we can appreciate what we have - our own little 'gem' as someone has described this
home made sauces, best teriyaki tempura dishes, simple but refreshing desserts (now with some creativity)
not all will be satisfied which is fine with me
to be selfish I'd rather many stay away, then we don't have to worry about the crowds
so rather than commend Raku, to everyone looking for a good spot - do go to Nobu, Haru, Sushiden, Yama, Tomoe, Sushi Gari, etc
I agree Raku is NOT AS GOOD AS THOSE PLACES!!!!!! NOT!
please do not listen to the above sour-puss of a reviewer
i have had the pleasure of eating at raku only a few times, but every experience has been delightful
the intimate, authentic atmosphere, the extensive menu, the high quality of food and the incredibly warm and friendly owner and staff have made raku my new favorite place for a quiet, enjoyable, delicious meal in the middle of the chaos of times square
skip the over priced, the pretentious, the touristy and the generic- and go to Raku
you won't be disappointed
The rave reviews seemed fishy but I decided to give it a try anyway
Showing up in the middle of business lunch, I found the restaurant empty
The sushi was mostly rice and avocado and a speck of actual fish that seemed tasteless
The miso was over-flavored and the price was not up to par with the quality I paid for
Compared to Yama, Sushi Yasuda and Tomoe, this place deserves a 5 not a 9
7! I bet the owner created the rave reviews
My boyfriend and I had never eaten sushi and they were awesome about telling us about it, he knew what to start us off with
The service and the food were great
I'd recommend it to everyone
huge comparison, but true! i work with many celebrities who frequent nobu, recently i ordered Raku for an office lunch, everyone raved eating every last piece making comparisons to the famous restaurant
i first discovered Raku w/my boyfriend who does not eat sushi, Ray swore and promised i would not be disappointed and that my boyfriend would leave eating sushi
sure enough he was right
i will only eat at certain places, and this one has topped my list
Though maybe not the best sashimi on the island, it has by far the best sushi rolls, and the prices are the most reasonable I have seen
Fish is fresh every time (I eat there once a week), and the variety, creativeness of the rolls, mixing textures and natural flavors is unparalleled (try the Chef's Special Rolls)
Not to mention for a huge sushi eater like myself, I can get a lot for a little $
The sushi was dry, the decor was average- not worth your money
I find it odd that the place got so many great reviews
my friend and i went to eat here b/c we saw the rave reviews on citysearch
this place was completely disappointing
our sushi was very fishy - we didn't even eat most of it
although the owner was nice, i wouldn't even go back here if the food was free
it's not worthy of it's rating AT ALL!
I love this place, first time we went everything was perfect, the food was excellent, Ray (the owner) was nice and friendly and made us feel very welcome
We just went back for our third visit and as per usual were treated by truly amazing sushi
This place is great and i would recommend it
The service has gotten a little slow and inattentive the server left us sitting with no water for about 15 minutes
Hopefully the new found popularity won't go to their heads and make them snub those of us who started going before the hype!
I went with high hopes as the rating was so high
Not completely disappointed but it was certainly not worthy of a 9
7 3 of us ordered a sashimi meal
It was the first time I had been given the miso soup after the sashimi had arrived, which was generally ok but the tuna was dry, and the pieces of fish were small
Even the pickled ginger had seen better days
Had to constantly ask the waiter to top up water glasses, but generally service was ok
Ordered 2 special rolls which were tasty but kept falling apart
However standard spicy rolls (we had tuna, salmon and yellowtail) were excellent and inexpensive
Good, but not excellent
I've eaten at the 'best'
Nobu, Matsushisa, Morimoto
these places have nothing on Raku as far as sushi is concerned
Owner Ray made sure we felt welocme, and Senji is a sushi master, creating an unbelievable Omakase (chef's choice) for me
Fish so fresh, even my girlfriend, who claims to not like raw fish, couldn't get enough
Make sure you try the White Tuna and the Monkfish Liver
Finish with the 'milky sake' and still have some money left to head out afterwards
I went to take my girlfriend to Raku for her birthday based on the great reviews I read on Citysearch
Unfortunately, I was so disappointed in the atmosphere that we didn't even eat there
Its small with poor seating arrangements and feels like a dive
The food is probably great, but we said forget it and went to sushi samba
Also a negative is that its in the heart of the theater district, which might be nice for tourists but not for me
It may be fun to go with friends, but its not a place for romance
If you're looking for a cute, sushi place with a good value, go to RAKU
Everyone was very nice, the ambiance is fantastic, and you get great, fresh sushi for a good price
The house sake here is great too
Raku is Fantastic! My girlfriend lives in California and I in New Jersey
we met in NYC for a nice Valentines Day and ate at Raku for the first time at lunch
The meal was spectacular, the service quick and the staff was incredibly friendly
Every time I am in NYC from now on I will be eating at Raku
Cheers!
FRESH SUSHI-GREAT SERVICE
We eat sushi at fine Japanese restaurants in NY and CT on a weekly basis
None better than recently experienced at friendly and convenient Raku
The freshness of the fish was apparent after the first bite
White tuna in the white dragon roll melted in the mouth
Outstanding were the other interesting special rolls and sushi
The service was prompt, professional and curteous
If you have any questions as to what to order, feel comfortable with their suggestions
Will return often to try the items we missed! Highly recommend this place for other lovers of Japanese food
I stopped by this restaurant for lunch while visiting NY with my gf because of it's excellent reviews and found them to be absolutely true to their words
This restaurant's food was mouth-wateringly delicious, service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere inside was warm and cozy
It was a great value and I will definitely be going back next time I visit NY!   Personal thanks to the owner Ray, who came and chatted with us about NY

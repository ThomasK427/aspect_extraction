The pizza was actually pretty darn good
It wasn't Lombardi's or Three of Cups good, but it was pretty up there - we were happy! It wasn't crowded in there and I could tell they appreciated our business
The atmosphere was pleasant and the service was impeccable
I felt compelled to put a positive review out there for them, because it was so much better than we thought
If you're with a group of friends or family and want good pizza, check this place out
This resaurant was so refreshing from the normal
Excellent menu and wine choice from New Zealand
Fabulous atmosphere and the service was top notch
The smoked salmon and egg sandwich was by far the greatest sandwich I have ever had
I have found my new lunch spot!
What a lovely restuarant! I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here! I was wondering through the West Village with my friends looking for a place to eat and randomly picked this place
The service was incredibly friendly and attentive
Everyone liked what they ordered, and the interior space is spacious and beautiful
I will definitly be coming back with friends
I was hesitant to enter the land of herring and
herring?  Smorgas Chef is a charming restaurant, with pleasant and attentive service, and amazing food
The open-faced sandwich I tried had fluffy scrambled eggs and the silkiest smoked salmon I've ever had, and I've eated a lot of lox over the years!  If you can get the window seat, it's fantastic
The cozy booths and tables in the back are generously spaced
Our cream of mushroom soup was yummy, the beet salad was delish, and the mains were great
There are chicken, lamb and beef along with the expected herring on the menu, and the special cocktails were yummy, althogh they could've stood in for dessert
Wines by the glass are reasonable and varied
Lots of special deals, as well
Tuesdays, take a friend and one entree is free - value of 22-28 dollars! Happy hours/two for one drinks as well
This place is great--drinks are beyond good, food is very well flavored and atmosphere is true west village charm
Cocktails are inexpensive and creative--a great addition to the area
Bartender and wait staff were friendly and super accommodating
I especially appreciate the drink / wine specials during the week! DEFINITELY will be coming back!
Billy's is a great WaHi option
All the food we've tried has been delicious
LOVE the mini's, they're a great way to sample everything (yummy mini burgers, chicken sandwich mac n cheese, an employee once said no order's complete without a mini mac n cheese!) Veggie burger, hot dogs, hearty sides fries also tasty
Kids' meals are great
Look forward to trying the ribs cheesecake
Clean place, friendly and helpful service
One gripe - there's no midsized chicken option other than a ground chicken burger
You go from a grilled chicken mini to a HALF a chicken for over $10 - a quarter chicken or large grilled chicken sandwich would be awesome to bridge that gap! Billy's isn't super cheap but the prices are all right
It's great grub, so it's definitely in our meal-options rotation
First time I was there its something different in the neighbrohood, when I ordered food the staff was nice and the service was really good, I got my food in about 5 minutes
After my meal the girls offered me a cheese cake, and said it was the best in town, she was right! The next time when I ordered delivery, I ordered spare ribs, baby back ribs and the rest was history, all natural ribs are incredible, just try it! Highly recommended
So this place uses antibiotic, free-range chicken? WOW!!! And it is not reflected in the price
Food was fantastic for take-out
Green beans were sauteed in front of me; mashed potatoes were real and the meat loaf was outstanding
They ran out of other vegetables though, but that's actually a good sign
I am really happy this place opened up
THANKS!
I know I should be eating the ribs or chicken, but they have the best burger on a great roll and get it with the blue/swiss cheese combo on top
I love this kind of place
where you can go with friends
and just be
The host, the tall Egytian {?} gentleman with the utmost regal manners attended to us on both occasions
He [as well as other staff] was superbly attentive, not to mention bringing us a plate of delectible Egyptian baklava on the house at the end of our night--what a touch
On another occasion, this same gentleman brought bottled water for our entire party [4] on the house again, when we missed our cab and asked to wait inside
Clearly, this gentleman knows good service and how to retain customer loyalty--I will be back again
Great teas, great hookah flavor selection, the most unique cozy ambiance
almost like you are in a cave of Moroccan design
The kabobs were surprisingly good
but the food shouldn't be the reason you go to Horus
Enjoy!
I went there last night with a friend and everything was perfect
The atmosphere is very chill, the music was arabic/latin, the food was delicious and the service was outstanding
I ordered the egyptian pharoah hookah which is pistachio and coconut and it was yummy!!! It is the perfect place to hang out with friends if you want to talk, smoke hookah and relax
Definitley a place to visit! Btw, its also very clean
a big plus in this city!
Well, I took a beatiful young lady out on a second date to this restaurants
though i truly enjoyed her company, i was extremely upset with our dinner
Actually, the appetizer was very good, but thats about it
It took me 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar
while i was waiting for her to arrive
I told the wait staff i would wait as long as need be to sit out front
but they insisted we sit on the side of the building
When they sat us, the waiter never came over till we asked him to
actually my date asked him too
the bottle of wine took 30 minutes and we had to ask them to put it on ice
the waiter didn't even know what was in the specials
even the bread stunk
My entree was wrong
if it wasn't for a great conversation, the night would have been a total disaster
this is the first time i wrote a review
i just felt compelled to complain, something i rarely do!!!
Went to dinner with my two girlfriends, and oredered a bottle of wine two salads and a salmon tartar
The bread comes toasted w/ a roasted pepper/sundried tomato in olive oil dip which is very tasty and a true tickle to your taste buds
The salads were unpretentious and tasty, greens and the other ingredients tossed in light dressings very appropriate for summer
This we followed with desserts; the ubiquitous tiramisu, the italian cassata which was fluffy and very light, departing airy taste of real chill whipCream and candied fruit and pistachios in a smooth amaro chocolate sauce, and of course the mille foglie w/ sliced strawberries - a true culinary achievement of taste and presentation! Nobody tried to serve our check until we asked for it, and that is a BIG plus in NY, we truly enjoyed our time and wine, and the pretty italian waitresses and trendy hostess and patrons :)
You can dress up, or go casual in this UES hip new restaurant!
I stumbled upon Per Lei last night and had an unbelievable experience
My friends and I did not have a reservation, but were graciously given a spot at the bar while we waited
We were seated within 15 minutes at a fabulous table where the doors opened up and made us feel like we were sitting outside
Great music and a good vibe make you feel as if you are at a party, but not in a way that is too loud or crazy
The crowd is very fun and hip, unlike some other restaurants in the area! The food was terrific and the service very attentitve
For a new restaurant, Per Lei really does things well
I can't wait to go back - especially on a warm night!
This place was so uncomfortably crowded
The space is small, and they packed lots of big tables inside
Had reservations, but still waited almost an hour to get seated
No waiters in sight, very slow and chaotic services
Got our drinks wrong, and you had to ask for things 2-3 times
Food arrived almost 45 mins after we sat down
It's very tasty, but I can get same quality at other Italian restaurants in this hood
Maybe when the buzz calms down, they'll get their acts together
Go for the food, not the service
7$ prix fixe lunch! The food is great and there's plenty of options

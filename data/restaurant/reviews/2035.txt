I'd rather have a bunch of monkeys slinging bottles behind the bar than these creeps
The maitre d' really puckers up for the aging eurotrash then explodes violently on the staff
Oh, and how much ABBA and smooth jazz can you stand in an evening? Find out here
There are bars in the area with better atmosphere and less irritating music
I have always wondered what the attraction to this bar is - the few times I have been there, I have been struck by it's overpriced drinks, it's utter pretentiousness, seen the manager (?) be incredibly rude to customers and staff, and wondered about their music selection -- a monotonous and pretty excrutiating collection of smoothe jazz and the like

In general, it's completely phoney and contrived classiness is a real turn-off, this place lacks the charm it strives for
In one word: pretentious
I think they are going for classy, but the atmosphere is fake and silly
Even worse, the service there is horrible
They overcharged me for a couple of glasses of wine (which are already expensive enough) and refused to take the charge off my bill
I would not recommend this bar to anyone
What a great combination! The drinks are prepared with such meticulousness, I finally found a place that makes great negroni
The ambiance is very classy and somehow relaxing
As for the menu, you'll find the perfect bar menu for `fins palais` Grab a book and watch a James Bond while sipping one of the best Martini in New York City
Looking for a place to relax? Stop looking, just get over Hudson Bar Books for a succulent drink prepared and served by friendly staff in a refined and tasteful environment
It's inviting and very relaxing if you want to chat with some friends or just read by yourself
They even have a great selection of cigars and a little lounge in the back
I heard they just open on Lex 73rd
Looking forward to it!
When I discovered Hudson Bar and Books, it was the Whiskey's night
I decided to try it out and was very impressed by the experience
I also had a cigar and some finger food wich were delicious
The perfect place to disconnect from the city-stress
I felt welcomed right away-
The drinks are good here - BUT, the service stinks
I waited 10 minutes to get change for a drink I ordered at the bar, my friend had one of her drinks dumped all over the floor by the same waitress above who took too long to get me my change, and it took forever for that much to happen
The staff seemed really confused - sweet, but dumb
Only improvement from other recent reviews I've read is that the infamous tv was not on
Decor isn't bad - but wow, the service sucks
Also, I don't understand why this is catagorized as a restaurant cause all I saw was a bar and drinking
Not sure why they killed what used to be a lovely atmosphere
They installed a big glaring TV and what look like heat lamps over the bar
The vibe just isn't what it was, and the staff cleared on out of there citing difficulties with the management
Terrible service
If you are looking for a courteous, friendly manager on staff to offer solicitious service, go somewhere else
Otherwise, if you want insults, threats and rudeness, this is your place
Ask for Flavin - he will be happy to ignore you at no additional charge
In Short When American comfort food cravings hit, this casual Village mainstay, with its sidewalk tables and spacious environs, does the trick
The open dining room is perfect for families--especially those with strollers--and there's plenty of room for large parties
The brunch and lunch menus cover familiar staples such as burgers, sandwiches and omelets
Dinner choices include meatloaf, pork chops, pastas, and indivual pizzas
I have to agree with one reviewer in as much as this restaurant had been going done hill some years ago, however -- and this is a big however -- it has done a total turn around
You are hard put to get better pasta dishes and salads anywhere on the island
The staff is attentive without being intrusive and all in all does their job and well
Watch out for those portions, they are huge
When my son lived in the Village, he'd order take-out regularly
I've been there a few times and each time it was excellent
My elderly parents came with us one Sunday and we were served garlic bread
my father was so happy! The waiter refilled our bread basket several times
I love the meat loaf and the veggie side
Drinks are reasonable
Go there!
for a consistent local restaurant (i don't recommend anyone travel from uptown or crosstown to visit) this place is the the best in the neighborhood
food is of good quality, and they deliver when you want to stay home and watch TV
The crab cakes, the pizzas, and the cheese tortellini are highly recommended
This is one of my first dining experiences in NYC when I first moved here 10 years ago, and although Hudson Corner is consistently good, it has gone downhill over the years in both food quality and service! I came in on a Sunday afternoon and asked if we could order off the regular menu as brunch was ending in a half-hour
I was told(very snottily) no, but then not even 10 minutes later another group of people came in, asked the same thing and because the same woman waiter knew them she gave them regular menus! I got up and left that day, have gone back and had good food at reasonable prices
they took off some really good menu items that need to be brought back, such as the chicken and mozzeralla salad and the grilled chicken w/pesto over whole wheat spaghetti! Lose the attitude, too!
There's nothing wrong with this place as far as it goes, but I thought I should do my civic duty and inject an element of reality to its ratings
The food and service are basic and well-priced but nothing special
What is that sauce that seems to get on everything? Make it a bit more red and call it General Tso's, darken it up and call it black bean
this place is cheap ($4
50 for a lunch plate, with a soda) and will not satisfy your need for great Chinese food
It's purpose is to give you Chinese theme calories in a hurry
But that is ok, if that is what you expect
The Scene Arrive early for your meal at this cozy Italian spot in the West Village
Given the stylish hordes sitting on benches and folding chairs outside, and the tightly-packed tables within, it's likely you'll have to wait--even if you did make a reservation
Servers recite a bewildering array of specials in heavily accented English--nearly everything offered is a hit
The Food Piccolo Angolo's Italian menu has never been accused of subtlety
From the full garlic cloves embedded in the pesto lasagna to the sharp pepper spicing a shrimp diavolo worthy of the name, these dishes are robust and rich
Don't miss the silken richness of the lobster-stuffed cannelloni, a rich and creamy Northern Italian favorite
A chocolate cannoli bursting with fresh ricotta will tempt even the most overstuffed to further excess
I'm disgusted
Made a reservation for 7pm; get there at 7pm; told to wait 30-45 minutes with no apology
Disgraceful
They need to learn to run a restaurant
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about! I went here recently after reading all of the reviews on city search
We tried a chicken and a seafood dish
it was completely average! I've had much better
The ambience was friendly, but so noisy that I had to shout at my boyfriend and he was sitting right across from me
The owner was very sweet, though, going around to the tables and talking with people
Overall, very UNIMPRESSED by the food and the apparent 'great value'
However, that said, a bottle of the house red wine was great - it was the best part of the evening!
If you're in need of comfort food without the typical New York scene, this place is it
It's so easy to feel right at home here
The food is incredible (don't pass up on the big-as-your-head meatballs!), and the service couldn't be friendlier
Not really a romantic place in your typical way, but if there's truth to the saying that a way to a man's (or woman's) heart is through his/her stomach, then this place is as romantic as any dark, candle-lit restaurant
Just be sure to make a reservation, which can be hard to come by
Hosted New Year's party for 11 at Piccolo Angolo after getting rave reviews from friends
Greeted by two of the owners, they offered to feed us a variety of dishes from appetizers to desserts, chef's choice
Reminding me of the best meals eaten in Italy, I graciously accepted, having to convince a few friends on the way
The food and house wines began to arrive, the only complaint was the lack of space for all the food on the table
There was a great variety for everyone, vegetarian's included
Particuarly great dishes: Seafood salad, bracciole, stuffed mushrooms, it was all reminiscent of a holiday at grandma's
No one left hungry, but everyone left with a great story
This restaurant is highly recommended for an authentic Southern Italian eating experience, just trust the chef and let the food come out
Best Italian food I've had ever in a restaurant, Italy included
This was easily the best time I have had yet in the city
I have cousins that live not far from here and I never believed them when they told me how much fun this place was

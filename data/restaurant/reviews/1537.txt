The kim chi dishes are tasty and good
And the best - all this comes at less than $25 per person! Great place!
Been here a couple times and I had to admit, as much as I love Korean food, this place doesn't do it for me
The pajun (Korean pancakes) was awful and the bibimbop was substandard
The kimchi noodle soup was fishy and spare
Both times I was there, I vowed never to come back again
And very pricey too
N

: I didn't try the Korean BBQ here but I hear this is the place to go if you want BBQ
This is a frequent restaurant for me when I'm in the mood for Korean
With a variety of dishes to try from, the food is usually pretty good
It is a bit expensive, but it evens out becuse you get a lot of side dishes which when you ask can be refilled for free
I personally like the gop dol bibimbap, hae mul pajun, and soon-dubu jigae
I haven't tried the barbeque because I don't eat red meat, but I heard that it's good also
The only down side is the service is usually horrible when it's busy, and the decor is a bit cheesy with a big screen tv in back and a waterfall in front
I've gone several times for the Korean BBQ of beef and shrimp for dinner
My friends decided to treat me for my 30th B-day last year at this place and it was a blast
The dumpling soup was bracingly superb and the seafood scallion pancakes are a must
My Birthday dessert was an abundance of fruits and ice cream
Service could be sluggish for a party of 16 but they did okay although some orders were missed
Get in before peak dinner time (7-8 PM) to avoid harried service
Tip, if you don't want to smell potently like BBQ, you can ask them to do it in the kitchen
Grilling tableside, your clothes better head for the dry cleaners or the laundry afterwards
The kim chi chige here is wonderful
It is my favorite dish
I often order it for lunch, and since it's so big, I take it home and end up eating it for dinner as well
The little side dishes are delicious
I admit that is the part of the Korean eating experience that I love
The wait staff is friendly, but you may have trouble getting your bill when it gets really busy
Eat here with your friends for a cool Korean night, or go alone for lunch
The Korean Barbecue was absolutely fantastic! The service however was less to be desired
I had to beg for a cup of water and we were left waiting for the check for an inerminable amount of time
If only the service could match the food this place would be much better
The food was delicious and worth being treated like second class citizens
Compared to Kom Tang Soot Bul, the meat is more tender and that's probably due to a better marinade
The atmosphere is also definitely livelier
The service at Kom Tang was better, I thought
and the atmosphere is more
umm
intimate? (At Kom Tang Soot I felt that I was at Korea even though I've never been, but Kum Gang San feels more like a Korean Restaurant in NYC
Kum Gang is more touristy, as I noticed from the crowd
However, still the food was excellent and had a great time
You gotta try both places, depends on what you're looking for
IN NYC! The service may be brash, but the food comes quickly and the it is just like homecooking! I would steer away from the soondoobu chigae, but the rest of the menu is delicious!
Great overall presentation of Korea's ample cuisine
If you like meat, try kalbi or bulgoki (make it yourself at your table)
If you like soups, there are plenty to choose from; aljigae is great if it's cold out and if you like caviar (but it's hot as hell, be warned)
The nice touch is the piano player and sometimes, a young lady dressed in traditional Korean garb playing a Korean harp
It doesn't always help that the waitstaff, ALL Korean, often speaks halting English at best
But they do run!
Kum Gang has delicious Kim Chi pancake but, unfortunately it took a half hour to get to our table
Seated in the upstairs part of the restaurant my party and I were subjected to rude, abrupt service and unmercifully long waits for our food
The BBQ is a definite novely but, when the grilling went haywire at the table next to ours the entire room filled with smoke
For the most part the waitstaff was friendly though a major obstacle to smoothe ordertaking was the Korean-English language barrier
Lastly, after spending a little over an hour and most of that time waiting for our food to arrive the manager barked at us to leave to make room for another party that had been waiting for 25 minutes! EXCUSE ME, Kum Gang, I along with my other friends that joined me for dinner, will be taking our business to another restaurant!!!
I have been going to Minar fairly regularly for almost ten years
It is a great place for lunch in the midtown area
The decor is not spectatular, it is a cafeteria-style place, but it is clear that they take great care in making the food, which is always great
Some particular favorites of mine include the Kala Chana (Fridays), the Aloo Gobi (fantastic), the Raajma, the Dal Makhani and the Saag Paneer
Their Fish Curry, which is a Friday Special is surprisingly good
I don't habitually eat fish, but this is one dish for which I will make an exception
Minar is not your typical cheap Indian restaurant, the food is better and more subtle than you will find at comparable places, in fact the food is better than most of the more expensive places too
this is the most hopeless place i have seen in city, in terms of service
All the females serving food have rude behaviour
And they never listen or help while you place order
Pathetic service
I use to go there regularly, but everytime I find this stupid service
Finaly i m not going anymore
I would advice to go to some other place
But if you dont care getting insulted while u pay for food, u can continue to go at this hopeless place
Although the atmosphere reminds you more of a cafeteria than a restaurant, don't be fooled
Minar offers an excellent variety of both the typical eats as well as some south indian cuisine
I highly recommend checking out the daily specials
Feel free to ask the staff questions about the food - they will be happy to assist you
I knew Minar in its former location years ago
It was great then, and it is great now
Just good, honest, inexpensive, Indian food to please anyone with a taste for Indian cuisine
It's a friendly place as well, and one of the reasons why it's great to live in New York
Minar cannot be beat
I have been going there for five years, and there is no better place to order from
It's not fancy, so don't make reservations
But the finest food to ever hit styrofoam
I love the Chicken Saag Bhuna, the Aloo Paratha, and the Chicken Tikka Masala
Hey, I'm not Indian, but I feel comfortable going where the Indians go to get their fill of Tikka
i have visited this place on 2 occassions, its like an average deli (i believe most deli's around the city get their food ingredients from a few vendors so the tastes can be judged in preperation more than ingredients
With that said
i ordered a veg sandwich, they charged me $4
75 for a roll with cheese onion and tomato
and a napkin
i felt ripped off!!! I coulda gotten a veg sandwich at subway for the same and actually fill my stomache!
Best place for late night pizza in midtown west
I would eat every meal there if it were closer to work
Having eaten here for lunch many times, I can definitely vouch this place for having some of the best per-slice Pizza in the city
The prices aren't horrible ($13 for a huge plain pie!) and the service is quick
On the surface, the pizzas look like any other pizza joint in Manhattan, but they taste fresh and are loaded with plenty of toppings
During lunchtime this place often develops a line that may even go all the way outside the restaurant and remains the most popular establishment on the corner
Not all is gravy however, they only take cash and there is no fresh pizza for dinner, only lunch
Interior is limited, but there is a second floor for dining to avoid some of the main floor chatter
I can only describe this place as an interesting mix of artists, locals, a little quirky Chelsea family of sorts

It's outstanding and well worth the wait
this restaurant is okay, and the reputation is not good as it suppose to be
i would not recommend bring friends here or theyll laugh at you
the food tasted like would you would get at a mall, and it was too salty
if you can, dont come here
Not as good as the reputation
They live off the outdated reputation! I was actually excited about jury duty so I can eat here every day
The reputation made my mouth water, but I was very, very disappointed
The dumplings are okay but it is just not that special
The other food besides the dumplings was inedible, worse then your average Chinatown food
Joe's soup dumplings are indeed delicious and legendary and are worth a visit just to eat this delicacy
However, the rest of the extensive menu is largely average
Any chicken dish will feature dry, boneless, skinless chicken breast meat that one would encounter in any Chinese restaurant in greater Iowa
Joe's also likes to pour goopy sauces on all of their dishes so if you are watching either your fat or sodium intake, ask for it on the side
Joe's legend is still alive so a wait is likely
Expect to dine at one of the large round communal tables seated next to other strangers eagerly awaiting a taste of Joe's legendary soup dumplings
It's one of our regular Chinatown places
We go for the soup buns and the Crispy Prawns in Citrus
Both are outstanding
At dinnertime, the place is in a state of utter chaos, with not enough space for those waiting for a table
The buns are worth it, though
Get 13 orders of the soup dumplings
Oh, so good!
All around a great chinese restaurant, but do not miss out on the soup buns!
The soup dumplings are out of this world
So good
Heavenly warm rich broth oozes out of the dumplings at first bite
To die for
Cheap good fresh food on menu
While the food is ok and service isn't too bad considering how crowded it gets, all the Shanghainese stay away and choose to go down toward Bayard (Yeah Shanghai or Shanghai Cuisine) for more authentic Shanghai cuisine
They all say that this is more like a Cantonese interpretation of Shanghai dishes
And the soup dumplings are the worst of it
Joe's Shanghai has the best steamed dumplings (shao loong bao) i've ever had
I'm from LA and thought i had it good here
Man, Joe's shanghai is more than generous w/ their portions
For $6, you get 8 gigantic dumplings FILLED WITH SOUP AND MEAT (pork or crab)
I didn't mind that we had to be seated w/ strangers, but what do you expect w/ a place that serves dumplings like this
Make some friends i guess
Ill definitely be back here on my next NYC trip
I also recommend their Beef Noodle Soup (nu ro mian) and potstickers (guo tie)
Enjoy
The dumplings are the best I've ever had
They are filled with a delicious soup and either pork or shrimp
Use the tongs to place them on your soup spoon
Puncture the dumpling and suck the soup out of it, then eat the whole thing
Worth the trip! I can't wait until I eat them again
It is a very busy restaurant with many communal tables
Be prepared to eat with stangers
The other food the restaurant serves is also good - no fast food Chinese here
Good service at a casual restaurant
the soup dumplings comes in a set of 8 for $4
25
Ordering one steamer per person as the main dish is more than enough
once you have the dumplings here, you will never want to eat it anywhere else
(note: the soup dumplings at Ollie's are expensive, dry, and pitiful shriviled up liitle things, never go there!) Joe's other dishes are decent, but nothing to get excited about
the service is blunt and to the point
during peak hours, they expect you to eat quickly and get out
Slightly over priced for a Shanghainese joint in Chinatown
Shanghainese places just a block away have the same stuff but $0
50-$1 cheaper per dish
The food is alright but sometimes too salty or not hot enough
But after all, Joe's is in the most touristy street in Chinatown
So the restaurant is quite presentable
But if there's a long wait, I'd recommend try taking a short walk to Mott Bayard
Yes, the soup dumplings here (both crab and pork) are very tasty
However, there are other dishes here that are pretty exciting as well
a lot of it depends on how adventurous you and your taste buds are
Other great dishes here include: lion's head meatballs (be warned, they are HUGE and are intended to be shared), soft tofu crabmeat sauce, braised pork shoulder, razor clams (or squid) in black bean sauce with jalapenos, and (if it's in season) baby pea shoots
ALERT: these are  NOT dishes that you'll find in your local take out, so if that's what you're expecting
expect to be disappointed
Also, I wouldn't order typical Cantonese style dishes here
this is, after all, Joe's SHANGHAI
stick with the typical Shanghai dishes
Come for the dumplings, best at lunch when you neither have to wait, nor sit with strangers
The rest of the dishes are great but the dumplings are sacred treasures of the NYC experience
Watch someone else eat them first though: there is a method and impulsive diners will find their clothing spattered!
that's a way to describe their famous dumplings
i'm from out of town, but the first time i had it, i knew i had to have it again
went back recently, and it was almost as good as the first time
other dishes aren't bad
but the only reason i come here is primarily for the dumplings
Plump, juicy pork dumplings are what brings me back to this place time after time
It's the best you can get, on the East Coast anyway

It's the best you can get, on the East Coast anyway
Of course, Joe's is famous for their dumplings and they are very good
Overall, it is a good place to eat
The service is amazing -- they were constantly coming back to make sure we had everything we needed
At $4
25 per steamer basket, this has to be the tastiest, most affordable dinner in all Manhattan
My friend and I cleaned out 3 steamers and practically waddled out, already planning for our next chance to dive into these incredibly delicious treats! Once you've had Joe's Shanghai pork dumplings you'll be hooked for life!
It looked nicer than the other places on that block, so we figured, why not? Bad choice! We ordered the steamed dumplings, house special lo mein, and house special fried rice
The dumplings came with a watered-down soy sauce and the pork was not only off-tasting, but my husband bit into a bone! The lo mein was a mix of chicken, pork, and shrimp
It was very bland
So was the fried rice, where house special means shrimp and scallops
We dumped the soy sauce on top to give it more flavor, that's how tasteless it was! I'm Chinese, so I know what constitutes good Chinese food
This was worse than Chinese take out places where everything swims in grease
At least their food is usually tasty! You would think that house special means something above and beyond the norm, but not at this place! One last thing to complain about- the tea was definitely watered down
It was like drinking water with essence of tea
In the end, I couldn't believe we shelled out $25 for subpar Chinese food! You have been warned!

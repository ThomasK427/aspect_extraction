Even the side dishes were bad,steak fries were almost burnt and steamed broccoli was limp and soggy
Waitstaff was friendly, but had to flag them down for drink refills
Could have tracked them down at the beginning of this horrible meal but it was about 10:00pm, I was tired wanted to leave
By the time the wait captain asked how the meal was we were almost finished
He was apologetic and brought us some free dessert samples
Big deal
Overall a very bad meal and bad experience that cost about $350 for 5 of us, a waste of money
I went to Uncle Jack's last week end with my wife for our wedding aniversary
What can I tell you ? It's the best dining experience we ever had so far in the city
We had a couple drinks at the bar before dinner, the barman was absolutely fantastic with us
We were seated next to a beautiful fireplace, we ordered the porterhouse for 2
It was juicy, tender, flavorful and was consistently made
The captain and the servers were great and very profesionnal
A bit pricey but it was definitely worth it
The food, decor and service were amazing
I highly recommend this place
I guess this place is for all the non-New Yorkers who have recently moved here
You know, the ones who move here from the Mid-West, live in a Trump building on the upper westside, and think they're real New Yawkers? (Sorry, ain't gonna happen
) This restaurant is for them
So it serves a purpose I guess
After dining in the best steak joints in NYC, Chicago, LA, KC, Chi
, SF,DC and elsewhere, this must be joke
Please stay in Queens, improve your food, service, and find top quality beef
A recent(DEC2004) visit to the relatively new Westside location was extremely disappointing
For steak lovers, and at these prices, stick to NYC top traditional places that know what they are doing when it comes to great steaks, properly cooked
By the way the Kobe at $150 is good according to one of my guests, but better buy a ticket to Japan for the real thing
Porterhouse steaks are as good as Peter Lugers
The seafood is excellent as well, especially the Chilean seabass and the seared sushi quality tuna
We were going to NYC for our honeymoon and were thinking about Peter Lugars until a friend recommended Uncle Jacks
and I am grateful! This was simply the best dining experience of my life! From the moment I walked in the door I was impressed! Everytime I'm back in NYC I will eat here! Yes, it's not cheap, but I've never felt so good about spending so much on dinner!
Classy, old-style chophouse that looks like something right out of Gangs of New York with the only exception being the well-placed Plasma TV's with the game of the night, which are viewable from virtually every table
I've never been in a joint this upscale with a game on and trust me, IT WORKS
Great place for a boys night out or a date
Excellent chops service from waiters to bartenders
Sides Desserts leave a bit to be desired, keeping this place from top ranking, but a definite winner on the NY Steak scene and a great pre-game spot for classy fellas like myself
Being one of the top steakhouses in New York City its hard not to pay for something that is delicious! The staff are very friendly professional, from taking your coat at the door to seating you within minutes and having the 'captain' of your table recite the menu
One really nice touch was pouring our already cold beers into fresh frosted glasses while we decided on which cut of meat to select
The porterhouse for 2 was fantastic! very well cooked and served Luger-style in its own juices and already sliced for you
The sides were excellent too - but the meal for 2 came to $220 with drinks tip! Ouch! but delicious
Steak is the best that I have tasted so far
The australian lobster tail was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth
Lamb chops were excellent
The steak sauce isn't as good as Lugar's
I've eaten in every steakhouse in New York City
Uncle Jack's is by far the best staekhouse in everyway
First, the steaks are unbelievably excellent
There is a quality that I can't describe but there's a remarkable difference in the taste, it's subtle but it makes difference
The Porterhouse which I've had at Jacks on 4 occassions was remarkably consistent and cooked to perfection, a welcome chane from Ben Benson's Smith and wollensky that do poor jobs and live off the reputation earned decades ago when they had litle competition
Even new comer Del Friscos has problems delivering food as ordered
The Crab Cakes at Uncle Jack's are worth the trip alone
When you taste these crab cakes you immediately know there's nothing else like it
Service is 5 star
No better service in ANY restaurant in NY
Go to Uncle Jack's once and you'll go back again and again
This steakhouse is one of the best in New York, TOP 3!! I shared a porterhouse for 3 and the meat was superb and so delicious
This place deserves more street credit and needs to be up there as one of the best steak restaurants in Manhattan
The service is above par as well which made my meal even more enjoyable
Great place, Great times, Great Steak
Open a week now, Uncle Jack's is an attractive space with an owner who seems to be very much on top of things
While service was, indeed, attentive, it was over the top in many respects and, in our case, a bit too affected
The food was certainly fine, although prices were high by any standard, with dinner for four being over $300 without drinks
Interestingly, cost only becomes truly apparent when dinner is over, as there is no menu before that presented for deserts
Most appetizers and entrees are presented verbally without prices, although a blackboard does list a few of each
Terrfic potential here, and with work addressing a wait staff trained to become your intimate friend by shaking everyone's hand as an introduction and curing the no-menu approach, it should become a hard reservation to get
The Scene A few years ago, this narrow space on 7th Street opened as the stupendously named "It's Greek to Me
" Since then, the decor and name have undergone revision
Subtle lighting, earthy woodwork, hanging pots and a comfy banquette complete the upscale Mediterranean vibe
The Food The menu offers so much to look over that you'll be happy for the complementary pita and not-too-fishy taramosalata, perfect with an inexpensive, fragrant glass of retsina
Start with the mixed seafood, bean and arugula salad--a surprisingly pleasant combination of textures
The meatballs, accented with mint, are as the menu promises, "light as air
" Staple entrees like moussaka more than make the grade, but the selection of clay pot-cooked dishes--tender lamb with orzo, or fish of the day with eggplant and zucchini--take comfort food to a new level
had a 9:15 reservation
waited outside for 25 minutes in summer heat
told hostess we were going to bar next door for a drink and air conditioning
she said she would call cell phone when table was ready
hostess called to say table was ready
walked back next door, table had been given to someone else! what nerve
a little too big for their britches
wouldn't recommend it to anyone, eventhough food has been great on previous trips
who needs that attitude
Been here twice and both times was blown away by the decor, service, food and fairly inexpensive pricetag
Portions are for real people, no skimping
Oh, and they are excellent about seating reservations on time
Highly, highly recommended!
I just had dinner yesterday at Pylos with 3 friends
We haven't met for the whole summer and it was a reunion we all have been expecting for quite a while
We had a reservation and when we entered we requested from the hostess to seat us to a nice table
And this polite Greek native girl did find us the best spot with a corner table
Not only we enjoyed the Amazing food, the polite and helpful waitor but the hostess managed to seat three more friends that joined us later and asked us twice if everyone was ok
I do not agree with the below comments and highly recommend Pylos for I had a great time!!
Everything was fabulous except the hostess
She was the least charming thing in this small but lovely restaurant
I made a reservation one month in advance and she tried to sit us at the table right by the door
I requested other table Originally I made reservation for 4 people but one could not make it
Hostess asked me to let her know if it happens next time but i was thinking what's the difference 3 ppl or 4 ppl? Are you going to split the table i half? She was walking around the restaurant whole nite looking at the tables and her watch
That was very tacky
She told my waitress to give us check which was not requested yet
She did not have a single smile on her face whole nite
It does not take too much to be pleasant
You just need a litttle bit of smile

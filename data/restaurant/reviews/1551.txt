It is turning too much into a tourist spot and the prices reflect this all too well
I'm not a connoisseur of deli food, but I know what I like
I had a chopped liver sandwich and a vanilla egg cream, and my husband enjoyed a pastrami Reuben with a chocolate egg cream
Both sandwiches were heaped high and very tasty
You won't have to fake it like Meg Ryan did
get the pastrami and tip the counterman at least $1 WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR ORDER and he will give you a better cut
If I only has one meal to eat on a stopover in New York, it would be here
ONCE YOU EAT PASTRAMI HERE ,YOU WONT BE ABLE TO EAT IT ANYWHERE ELSE,MAKE SURE YOU TIP THE COUNTER MAN A BUCK BEFORE YOU ORDER AND HE WILL USE A BETTER CUT OF MEAT AND MAKE THE SANDWICH BIGGER
ALSO BE FRIENDLY WITH HIM AND HE WILL ALSO ADD EXTRA MEAT
THEY USE TWO CUTS,ONE FOR THE CHEAPIES AND ONE FOR THE SMARTIES,REMEMBER THAT BUCK
Don't go to Katz's for anything but the food
It never ceases to amaze me when people write negative reviews of excellent, cheap-eats type places and fault them for their spartan decor, surly puryeors, and basic service
Go for the Reuben, Brisket, or any of their other hard meat selections and leave your high expectations for superflous qualities at home
If you still don't get it, then maybe next time you should leave yourself home as well
All the other delis might be able to boast better service or better seating or this or that
The one thing that Katz's does better than anyone else is Pastrami
I'm a regular uptown at Carnegie, and make my trek to Second Ave once in a while
Grew up on Pastrami King and Ben's Best in Queens, so I know a thing or two about Pastrami
No one does it better than Katz's
Their corned beef and other sandwiches leave a little to be desired, but the Pastrami, you ain't gonna find any better
Anywhere
Katz's Deli is a MOST stop everytime I go to NY
Nothing compares to their hot sandwiches! You must try the hot pastrami or hot brisket sandwich
They're big enough for 2 people!
Every time I come to NYC from Pennsylvania I stop for a pastrami sandwich take a 5 pound piece home
It's the best place i NYC
Still a classic w/ NYC attitude and the best pastrami in town
Now I know why Sally from When Harry met Sally reacted like she did
the food is that good! A must for all NYKR's and Tourists!
Forget the high priced Stage and Carnagie Delis this place is better and much les expensive
their corn beef and the pastrami are the best that money can buy and one sandwich is enough for two
Born and rised on the lower east side
The food is still as good now as when I was a kid
Luck me, my grammar school was across the street
You have to eat their steak fries
A vegetarian's nightmare (and the cow isn't sleeping too well either), Katz's Deli offers little in the way of comfort, luxurious decor, or for that matter politeness in its staff
What it does offer in spades (make that tractor loads) though is meat; accustomed to UK (read:normal) sandwiches I was little prepared for the eight inch high pile of pastrami and corned beef that was heaped between two slices of strangely insubstantial bread
It tasted fine, as did the excellent slaw and macaroni, though it was deadeningly heavy
Less pleasing was the bill which was higher than expected
While the decor does not inspire romance or images of a good-eats place (I guess this is why they call it a deli
so one is prepared), the portions are ENORMOUS and quite yummy
Go there on an empty stomach, and you won't need to eat for the rest of the day!
The pastrimi sandwich is simply the BEST in the city
The lunch-room, no frill dining adds to the charm
Don't ever change!!!
Hard to put into words
Quite an experiance with my 3 kids having gone to some of the nicer places in town, we went to katz after theater in my suit
Needless to say I felt out of place
I saw some of the roughest looking people in Manhattan in this place (patrons and workers)
I loved the pastrami and the experiance
My wife and kids were not as thrilled
Dingy w/ yellowed pictures of all the famous people IE President Clinton after 2 hot dogs and a pastami WOW howed he do that, Jerry Lewis, and of coarse Harry Sally
I do recommend Katz!
i love this place!! the pastrami is delicious, and my fave sandwich
don't miss out on a plate full of fresh dill pickles
try the chicken noodle soup when you need some comfort food
enjoy an egg cream or a cel-ray soda with your meal
if the guys at the counter are working slowly, head over to the waiter service tables
they can get in and get your sandwich faster than the guys at the counter if there is a long line
Dear God without doubt-the best sweet potato knish's and also some of the best pickles you can come by!
Puts Carnegie and Stage Delis to shame! Dingy but colorful, great food, huge portions -- and just plain lots of fun
If you come to the city and miss going to Katz's, shame on you!
You stand in line with twenty other starving souls
You nudge to the front of the line and the server slides a small dish your way with a piece of corned beef and a wedge of pickle to nibble on while he slices your sandwich
The pastrami and corned beef are handed sliced
You like lean
they got lean
You like fatty
they got fatty
You want New York Deli
this is New York Deli
Any place that uses a slicing machine for corned beef and pastrami might as well move to the suburbs
Katz's will still be in New York
Sure it's expensive and dingy, but come on
it's Katz's
I don't see how anyone can think you'll get a better pastrami sandwich anywhere, and the hot dogs are the best around
Katz's is classic New York, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it
Great tasting pastrami if you get the extra lean, too expensive for the amount of houseflies
A classice New York deli atmosphere, minus the attitude
The meats (pastrami, corned beef and tongue) are quite good (note: NOT best) but don't have anything else
Matzoh ball soup was tasteless, pickles were limp and fries were mostly soggy and greasy
And the ambience is supposedly tradition but more like an excuse to avoid spending money to renovate
For the business and prices they charge



Take the meat to go, or go a bit further north to 2nd Ave Deli
Katz's pastrami is juicy, tender, and simply divine! Service is quite fast as well
I have lived in the Lower East Side most of my life and have seen the quality of Katz's decline during the past few years
Last night (a Monday night) my husband and I went to Katz's for corned beef sandwiches, french fries and a soda
The meat was old and funny tasting, stringy and very small in portion
The french fries were also old and had been re-fried
We were extremely disappointed
We spent $30 on two sanchwiches, one french fries and 2 soda
That's outrageous for the quality of food we were served
Spend a little more and go to the Second Avenue Deli, you can never go wrong
Another ho-hum New York Pizza place
Pizza here is NOT BAD, but it's NOT something worth recommending to friends or going out of your way to try
If you happen to be within walking distance of this place and you are hungry
Stop in for a slice

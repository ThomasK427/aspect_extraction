It was a nice break to go somewhere in the city on a Saturday night and NOT need a reservation or have to wait two hours for a table
It was bustling but we got right in and were served right away
The staff is friendly and accomodating
I am a vegetarian and so I got the Vegetarian Combo (bean burrito, cheese enchilada, and yummy guacamole tostada) and it was GREAT
It was refreshing to see a mexican restaurant that tries a little harder to please non-meat eaters, as opposed to those that just slop some beans rice on a plate
My friend got chicken enchiladas and loved them
I would definitely go back again
I am a lover of Mexican food and this place didn't knock my socks off
The margs were watered down and not too tasty and the food was ok, but not flavorful enough
The guac is good, but there are better places to go for that
The service was delightful and the people were nice and helpful, but I don't think I will go back in the near future
This place has been one of my favorite staple restaurants for almost 10 years
It has a great atmosphere, warm and friendly service and yummy stuff to eat from the beginning to end of your visit
Great sangria, delicious seafood chimichangas, cheese enchildadas and chorizo quesadillas- and for dessert decadent fried ice cream
If you are looking for really good traditional mexican, not trendy- chic this is the ideal place
I stopped in Grace's one night by chance to escape the summer heat and humidity and had a drink at the small bar
I was determined to return for dinner and I did
This is a charming retaurant
Basically two cozy rooms
The front room with the small bar and a somewhat larger back room
The decor is simple, lovely and inviting
The staff are friendly and well-trained
I have a feeling this place has a lot of regulars
My date and I started with the garden salad and the caesar salad
As boring as salad is it can be a sign of the food to come
They were both delicious, crisp, fresh and tasty
We then shared the baby octopus with small potatoes - perfectly cooked with a lovely briny flavor and finally the swordfish livornese (a special) which was also quite delicious, the fish perfectly cooked (they nicely split the fish in the kitchen)
The meal, with two drinks and two cappucinos, came to $86
Although I live accross town from Grace's I wouldn't hesitate to go back
If I did live nearby I would probably become a regular too
Wonderful spot right by graces marketplace
Delicious, authentic italian food (the pasta fagiole is to die for), lovely waitstaff, and outstanding service
I have gone here at least once a week since it opens and haven't tired of the menu
Lots of variety, and everything is fantastic
Good Food
Easy reservations
Nice Decor
The service was outstanding
The waitstaff clinging on our every need
They aimed to please--and did
The food, service and decor are perfect
We ordered the scallop and lobster with pasta and they were delicious
So was the smoked salmon pizza
Great place for business or family dinner
When you are headed to Grace's Market to do some grocery shopping, do yourself a favor and go to the restaurant just next store
Grace's Trattoria
The food is amazing, the atmosphere is very welcoming and chic, and the service is so friendly
Its a great place to eat and have a wonderful meal and a NY dining experience without the hassle of an oversized restaurant
Brunch is great too!
Their food will melt in your mouth! It just might be the best Italian food without being in Italy! DO NOT leave without trying the ricotta cheesecake!
We happened to catch Oprah saying this was her favorite spot in the world and called for a reservation
Coming in late was a good approach as we did not feel rushed
We both had wonderful pasta dishes
Mine was not on the menu - the waiter said he could make something with Porcini mushrooms when I mentioned them
It was a bit more but worth it
Highly recommend
The cramped seating was actually quaint
The food was only so-so, although the waiter tells you everything is wonderful
I also felt like they were trying to feed us and turnover the table
In Short This chain of upscale diners serves big helpings of American comfort food at reasonable prices
The interior looks like a Rockwell painting, with classic blue-and-white diner decor and an old-fashioned lunch counter
Regulars love the oatmeal and granola with fresh fruit and berries, and the almond-corn-flake French toast is a signature
Typical diner food makes the rest of the menu--burgers, chili, buffalo wings and peanut butter and jelly for the kids
It's just a diner - waiter nice, food decent, ok prices, typical diner decor, not an overwhelmingly impressive experience
It's just average
its always so busy and i have to say ive eaten there a few times and its never been what ive expected
the pancakes are spongy and tasteless, the coffee is HORRIBLE and the service is generally nice but slow
I think they are good for eggs but stay away from the pancakes
great brunch and very inexpensive
basic eggs, etc
UWS has wonderful outside eating area perfect for summers
I love this spot, there are so many good things on the menu I can never decide what to eat
It gives you that diner feel but definitely with better then diner food
The service is always great too, wait staff always has a smile on their face
Never order delivery from EJs
My food came uncooked and soggy
When I called to complain, they did not believe me that my food came from EJs since they could not find the ticket and gave me a hard time about sending me something else
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
I'm not quite sure why the editorial review of EJ's raves about the cereal
Seriously, it seemed like it came out of a box: a little gray and dry
Not at all like the scrumptious granola at Chat 'n' Chew's!! However, all the other breakfast foods seemed great, especially considering all the below-par diners on the Upper East Side
I drooled over the crunchy french toast
IT'S TRUE
EJ'S HAS GREAT PANCAKES
EJ'S HAS DECENT SALADS
THE FOOD IS CLEAN AND NOT TOO COMPLICATED
THERE IS A DEFINITE EFFORT TO MAKE DOWN-HOME FOOD ALBEIT THE LUNCHEONETTE KIND
THE LINES ARE OUT THE DOORS ON SATURDAYS BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY PLACE ON THE EASTSIDE TO GET THAT DINER-ESQUE ARCHIE COMIC BOOK BREAKFAST FEEL
EJ'S SUCCEEDS IN ALL ASPECTS INCLUDING SOLID SERVICE AND EXCELLENT COFFEE CAKE
Great selection of food! Several yummy looking vegetarian suggestions
I would love to go back to try more
Big fat challaha toast
was great!
Although it's just your basic diner, EJs makes an effort with the addition of fresh fruits to their dishes
Yes, it is crowded, but what do you expect from a family favorite
Terrible, over-rated food
Waits that sometimes exceed an hour
Harried, surly and unhelpful staff
Strollers, whining kids and dirty, slippery tables
Makes cooking breakfast at home a great option

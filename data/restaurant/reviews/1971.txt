We used to go after drinking and dancing and order more wine/beer with dinner
Linguine white clam sauce/garlic and oil, chicken parmagiana (and pasta) with mild/medium/hot sauce (depends how brave you are) is reliable
The raw bar can be off with one/two clams/oysters smelling funny
Since it changed owners/chefs, the portions are smaller (I always used to ask for a doggie bag for my chic-parm), now I can finish and still be hungry even after appetizers (which aren't as good anymore)
Oh well, they messed with a good thing, now it's not so good
I even saw Bruce Morrow there once - you know the '70s dj - 'cousin Brucie'
He was very friendly, even came over to say good night and shake our hands
The bill back then was always reasonable but no more
Servive is fine but all else falls short
Good for a meal till 4am
Umberto's doesn't live up to their hype
We wandered into this little restaurant after a long day of exploring New York
Although they had the trailing end of a small Italian wedding going on, they welcomed us in and served us large portions of the most surprising delicious Italian food
The prices were reasonable, the food exceptional, and the atmosphere was welcoming and (at least for us) romantic
We go back every time we are in the city and you should, too!
Found this place randomly four years ago and haven't stopped going since
They have THE BEST caprese salad this side of Tuscany (the buffalo mozzarella they use is the best mozzarella in NYC)
Their foccaccia is delicious (and it's the regular bread they serve for free)
And of course the entrees are perfect
The service is very friendly and the price is right
I lived up on Arthur Ave
and this place goes toe to toe with Mario's and the other Best Italian Places in NYC
I ate at Le Streghe when in Manhattan for work in February
I was left on my own for the afternoon in SoHo (I'm from Nashville) and was completely overwhelmed with the activity and bustle
I ducked into Le Streghe for a late lunch and to take a breather
I found I was the only patron and was therefore skeptical
I was pleasantly surprised, however
The kind-of-scary host/server spoke broken English but was very attentive
The risotto was absolutely wonderful (spinach, tomatoes, lots of garlic and pecorino romano), and was nicely paired by an Italian wine recommended by my server
I managed to find a cozy spot in a completely foreign city, and will definitely make a return trip the next time I'm in town
If strolling around SoHo, you should be so lucky to stumble upon this little gem
The food was outstanding (and apparently award winning)
Very cozy little mediterranean themed Italian eatery
In an area of overdone and overly hip restaurants, this place takes the cake
I've never been to Malaysia, but if the food there tastes anything like they do at Nyonya, than I have nothing to worry about
The food is flavorful and comes in large portions
The staff is quick and loud
The decor is nothing to brag about, but you're not going there for atmosphere
The evenings are always packed, so expect a wait
But it'll be worth it
Having spent 18 years in Singapore, I get Southeast Asian food cravings now and then that I would typically satisfy at Nyonya on Grand Street
The fried kway teow, mee siam, sting ray (skate), rendang, belachan kang kung (water convulvus) and burbur hitam all hit the spot for me
I don't claim that the place as the most authentic, but when you're talking about Southeast Asian street food, which really represents a melting pot of cultures and have slight variation in style for many similarly-named dishes depending where yuo're specifically from, who's to claim what's authentic? I just knows it tastes good
The place gets noisy and crowded but the service is brisk and the menu's very affordable
The food here is great
Having lived in Singapore, the food here is authentic and delicious
However, the service here could improve
We were promptly given back our check when our waitress told us we made a mistake in our tip calculation (basically, she told us we didn't leave enough
)
Found this place 7 years ago and it has become my favorite in the city
Great food and inexpesive
Nyona is my version of comfort food and I am not even close to Malaysian, except possibly in the stomach
Go enough where the hostess recognizes my wife and I
As an expatriate Singaporean, I find Nyonya's offerings rather inconsistent
When they're in good form, it's decent
But when they have an off day
oh boy: I've had watered-down laksa lemaks; bland char kway teows; kang kong belachan that wouldn't rate more than a sniff, etc
If you want inexpensive, then this is it
But you get what you pay for
I'd rather go to Penang on Elizabeth Street or Sanur on Doyer Street
The Most Authentic M'sian Rest
I have ever eaten all across the U
S
My bf, also a M'sian, can't believe he can see, smell, taste enjoy authentic kopi tiam (hawker stall) style Char Kwai Teow and Hananese Chicken Rice outside of M'sia
As a New Yorker, and a M'sian, I would highly recommend this restaurant
It truly feels like coming home to M'sia
I especially LOVE the nasi lemak and the rendang
yum yum
=)~  A little clarification though, there's also another American version Nyonya Cuisine Penang owned by the same owner in SOHO
The restaurant is more up scale and the food is designed to suit the Americans taste
So make sure you go to the one on Grand St
if authenticity is what you sought after
Poor LuLu Intan, she went to the wrong restaurant and started irrelevant complains
=P
After reading all the raves and reviews about this restaurant, my husband (Malaysian) and I (Indonesian) decided to try them out during our NYC visit
This is most probably the MOST OVER RATED restaurant I have ever been to
The cooks are OBVIOUSLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO COOK MALAYSIAN FOOD!!!!!!!!! They are cooking to please the American audience
The taste on every single entree is watered down and they can't even cook a simple appetizer such as Popiah??? And they call themselves Penang restaurant? The service is great although a bit rude
The only good thing about this place is the price
Please set your expectation accordingly because you will be disappointed
Nyonya is probably the only authentic restaurant that serves SE Asian cuisine in the City
You know by the number of Singaporeans and Malaysians that dine there
Ask any one of these ethnic groups where they dine and they'll all say, Nyonya
Food is very tasty and inexpensive
Local faves include kueh teow, laksa, chicken rice, and chendol for dessert! Forget about Penang
This is the only place to go
This restaurant is not to fancy, but the food is GREAT!!!!! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone
It's a great place to come for a casual meeting w/ friend or so
I was disappointed that this NYONYA is not as good as the one in Brooklyn
Perhaps because we went on a Friday night, so it was way too busy for the kitchen to perfect on their dishes
We had hainanese chicken with oil rice, a specialty here
However the rice was somewhat bland and dry
The indian pancake was re-heated, hence, dry and crackly
The pad thai was overcooked with soggy noodles
Highly disappointed
Nyonya is by far the tastiest Malaysian restaurant I've been to in NY
All their dishes are very flavorful and prices are great! I've never been disappointed and doubt I will be
MUST TRY!
Nyonya's great - the food's more flavorful than any other Malaysian place around, the variety's incredible, and the chaos around you is refreshing
A great place for a large, cheap group dinner (if you're not too into ambience)

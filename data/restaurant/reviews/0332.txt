We were greeted by a incredibly courteous hostess
The waitress was knowledgable and accommondating
The food? It was outstanding
I raved about it to my friends and family afterward
Highly recommended if you are in the neighborhood
My date? I wish it was half as good as the food
Great place, cool crowd, good food
I'll definitely be back there on my next date
nice light environment
no wait (at 2:00, anyway), and unique menu
food's pretty good
I have only been to Jane for lunch and my boyfriend absolutely loves it
The food is fresh and service is excellent
I find that the hostesses are very good and always try to accommodate us where we prefer to sit
I am a little upset that they changed the menu
cannot get the simple eggs and toast meal anymore, but would recommend to Brunch seekers on a nice Sunday afternoon!
had dinner the other night and thought it was wonderful
the food was terrific and a great deal, the staff was friendly and helpful
the drinks were fresh and fun
overall i think Jane is a great restaurant
I used to love this place, but what happened? They had the friendliest, most knowledgable staff
I went in recently, and all my old friends were gone
A completly new and inexperienced staff, and a RUDE management (I think it may have been the owner, not sure)
The food is ok, the starters and sides are the real winners (Arugala salad, potato dumplings)
However, it was always that staff (and the huge $9 cocktails, now smaller and $11) that kept me coming back
oh well
I'd heard good things about Jane, but my experience was pretty negative
The host was aloof; my waitress, though sweet, didn't seem to know the food or the menu very well; and the waiter we flagged over to order our wine seemed as if he had never looked at the wine list before
The fries were weak, the steak was chewy, the fish was dry
The cocktails were fun and the wine list is a good value, but I won't be back
Mdae reservations after reading positive reviews and viewing the website's menu and pix
Waitress must have been new, very inexperienced
Food sounds promising, but was awful
Tartar -not fresh, fondue - unbalenced and amateurish, pork -dry, and the fries were boring
Didn't hang around for dessert
I was looking forward to our brunch after reading reviews on this site and in other publications, I loved the idea of a well priced traditional brunch
I was not thrilled with the experience
My eggs Benedict James (i think
) seemed like a geriatric dish, everything was mushy, from the undercooked (raw whites) egg, to the well-seasoned yet very soft turkey sausage and the very soft corn pancake
I missed the crunchiness of an english muffin
Thank god for the crispy, deep fried looking potatoes
Our coffee was of good diner quality
The bloodies were excellent - strong and spicy
Overall, not worth the hype or the wait at the door (even after we had a confirmed reservation
)
I think there are many resturants in New York which try to be trendy
Most of the time however, they miss the mark and your experience leaves you feeling robbed
At Jane I had a FABULOUS experience
The servers were sweet and very knowledgable of the food AND wine
The managers are floating around keeping things running great
I dropped my fork and I had one in seconds without asking
I think the best part was the food
FRESH, NEW AND DELICIOUS
Don't miss out on this place! And the Angelika is right around the corner
so good!!!! went with a friend, and we each had great breakfast food (i had the omlette, she had the french toast)
with two drinks, which are included with the meal (the bloody mary was fantastic), the total bill was $22
what a steal!  make a reservation on their website to avoid the line
it was simple, and saved us a lot of time
Went for dinner last Friday night with 2 friends, and the staff was incredibly nice
We canceled a reservation for the previous night and got stuck in traffic on Friday, but were still seated immediately by a friendly host when we arrived
The food was great - entrees and appetizers wonderful, but skip the sides and dessert if you're on a budget
Use that money to get a few drinks instead
The peach sangria and watermelon martini were both out of this world
I had a birthday dinner for nmy boyfriend
We had about 15 poeple there and others who stopped by for a drink
We did not have to do a price fixe menu and that was great because I knew some poeple would just stop for drinks
I must say the food was not only great, but what made this such a wonderful night was that the staff and waiters were VERY ACCOMODATING and NICE (something which is sometimes hard to come by, with large groups in the City)
I would suggest this place for any event
They really made what could have been a hectic night for my boyfriend
perfect for my boyfriend!
Jane is a great place to go with a group or a couple
The food is always good and the drinks are always great - try some of their specialty cocktails - you will not be sorry
I ate at Jane last night and loved it
Service was attentive, but not stuffy
Decor was trendy, but not intimidating
I ordered a number of starters and sides and shared them with my date - all were well presented and tasty
A great list of cocktails, too - I highly recommend the watermelon martini! Always nice to see a celebrity sitting at the bar, too!
Food, service, price and atmosphere were excellent
Great and fresh ingredients make the food very tasty
One of the best places I've been lately in New York
Very nice experience
The food was surprisingly delicious
I like to dine at different place every time I go out, but if I have to, I would surly not mind eating here again
I have been going to Jane since it opened and everytime I go, the food and the service always blow me away
Where in NYC can you get great food, great service and great ambiance all at reasonable prices? Most NYC restaurants lack one of those characteristics
When I went in for dinner this Sunday, after a 2 month absence, I noticed their addition of table cloths, which really add to the ambiance and I noticed that their wine list has been expanded
Jane is the perfect spot for a casual meal, a date and a business meal
Run, don't walk, to Jane!
Nice atmosphere, great food and reasonable prices for this somewhat trendy eatery
Service was very good and friendly
Jane never fails to disappoint
The food is always hearty and tasty
Jane has never struck me as the type of restaurant that's wildly inventive food
But more of the neighborhood place I'd want to go to, for good solid food, and great service
The service has never failed to be anything than professional
Martinis from the bar are mixed at the size of 1 1/2 drinks, and the wait staff leaves the whole glass there, returning to pour you your remaining drink as your glass empties
The appetizers sometimes outshines the entrees
The grilled shrimp and tomato flatbread is a standout
And Jane prepares its fish quite well
The interior is warm in tones of brown and beige

I felt like I was at a 4 star restaurant
Can't say enough good things about this place
I know its vogue to slam this restuarant with the former chef doing all he can to distance himself (while his new place falters), but the food is better, the service excellent and the atmosphere second to none
I've lived on the LES for 2 years now and had yet to try this restuarant until last weekend
I made a reservation with a very helpful young lady, especially when I had to make changes to the reservation
My fiance and I came early hoping to be seated, and were told to wait in the lounge
We had some absolutely superb sangria, but ended up not being seated until 15 min AFTER our resevation time
We were placed in the room with a skylight, which was also dissapointing because I had hoped to be seated in the room with the water
Regardless the room with the skylight was pretty great, especially that chandalier! My fiance and I tried the tasting menu and loved it
Overall it was a pretty great experience and am even considering making this my after work spot for drinks - that sangria was pretty impressive!
Everybody talks about the space issue on this restaurant
I went there for Sunday flamengo dinner
space is extremenly small and service was horrible
While I was having my food, they just took away
For flamengo, it was good
However, not for food or service though
I heard good things about Suba and expected to be in for a treat
Unfortunately, my (shrimp) appetizer was very bland, my (cod) entree made me mildy nauseous, and my (olive cake) desert tasted a bit like charred shrimp with ice cream on the side
I'm not a picky eater, but the food was terrible
The service was good (we had a large group and the staff was very accomodating) and the atmosphere was great
In short: stick to a more notable tappas/spanish eatery if you want great food
The food was definitely not worth the price
bland and served luke warm
Some of the best food I've had in NYC in recent months
The place is beautiful and inviting
Good service, exceptional food
definetly a must try
We arrived an hour ealier from our reservation
They tried to seat us as soon as possible with no luck because the place was packed
It was worth the wait
This place has great ambience - in the grotto your table is surrounded by water on all sides and the light is amazing
The food was some of the best I've tasted in NYC - really exceptional
A bit loud expensive, but hey, it's New York LES
We loved the food, the atmosphere, the grotto feel, the drinks were amazing, the service impeccable
BUT we were squeezed like sardines in a SMALL can
Please, please, take four tables OUT and see your guests bright smile, become even brighter!
I visited Suba with friends for my birthday a year ago and came back because I was so pleased with the entire night
We had prompt service, were seated quickly, the staff was friendly and the food and drinks were fabulous, both times
They also have a really fun late night scene with latin dancing and great bartenders! I highly recomend this place to anyone looking for good food, hip atmosphere and sexy dancing
Went here last weekend and had a great time, so I wanted to see what people were saying (backwards, I know
)   I'm actually surprised by some of these comments, because my friends and I really enjoyed it
We too sat in that second dining room, and eventhough I had wanted to sit by the water, but the back room was great too
The waiter was nice and knowledgible, he even helped our vegi friend pick out his meal (It's true there were only a few dishes that worked, but it's SPANISH food, people!!!)  Anyhow, the service was really accomodating, and it makes me wonder if other people here even ASKED for the waiter's help, because our experience was helpful and fun
As for the noise, go anywhere on a weekend in this city and you're going to hear it, obviously weeknights are quieter
(I'm hesitating to use the word duh)
I had been here 2 years ago on a week night and sat in the room with the moat
I returned with a group this past weekend
This time we were in the other back room which was VERY noisy with little ambience
Our waitress was unbearably rude and we had to complain to the manager
There is little to no vegetarian food on the menu and all of fish dishes have beef broth or duck skin/fat on them
The descriptions on the menu are not accurate and we ended up having to send 2 of the dishes back
While the salads and deserts were enjoyable, the overall dining experience was eally frustrating
While were were outside after the meal, another couple came out of the door and said That place sucked! Apparently we weren't the only ones who had had a disappointing meal
at first I was put off that this was a pre-paid event 4 weeks in advance of valentines day !!!! However, the experience was well worth the hassle(not terrible really) I love The grotto
My girlfriend swooned
the drinks/wines were great
and the Food
unique
special
romantic
worth It
Decor - Sexy! Food - Delicious! Service - Good! I will be back
My boyfriend took me to Suba for our year anniversary and I have to say it was one of our best dates EVER! THe service was really good, the waiters were all really attentive, but not overbearing
after dinner we stayed at the bar for another hour because the space was so comfortable, and the cocktails were so good! (they have like 6 different kinds of mojitos alone!) I really want to go back ona weekend with all my girlfriends beacuase it seems like it can be romantic AND super fun!
Beautiful restaurant
Very NYC feel
Service was great but not amazing
The food was good, but not memorable
(soup was not hot, fish was ok but not terrific)
Overall, def
worth going but the attraction is the atmosphere more than the food
I have been to many a restaurant during my years in NYC, and this is the first one I have decided to review because it was so mediocre
While the food is tasty, it doesn't knock your socks off
And while the service was good, it wasn't great
I think for the money that you spend at Suba, you should spend the extra $15-$20 a head and go someplace that is exceptional
and there are many
If the entree prices fell within $15-$18 range you would have walked away feeling like you got your money's worth
But not for the price that they are
Oh, and you can't get tapas unless you are at the bar
Suba is a cute place that is good for meeting up w/ folks for drinks at the bar Tapas downstairs before heading out to paint the town red
Sexy crowd, although sometimes so loud you can't hear any part of the conversation
Food is mediocre
Nice Dark for dates
If you look at the other reviews, you'll see that this place is a 'hit or miss'
The food and decor is above average, but it is clear the restaurant has bad management and service
We had a 6 party for dinner and was told that we must order prix fixe
They claim that we were told on the phone
We were planning to prix fixe anyway, but it's another thing to be forced to do it when reservations never informed us
The management has a very bad attitude and the guy had the guts to tell us that they are forcing us to take prix fixe to save us money -- yes, $2!!! Dine at this place at your own risk
Since Suba is just around the corner from one of our favorite bars, Verlaine; my boyfriend and I decided to give it a dekko
We were seated in the grotto, despite not having reservations
The place was beautiful, but more trendy than romantic because of the noise factor
It was still bustling when we left close to midnight on a Saturday
We were very impressed with the food
The scallops were delicious and my hangar steak was served perfectly rare
I don't remember all the accompaniments but we did enjoy the mashed potatoes, olive and passionfruit sauces
The pork was a bit of a let down- too sweet for me
Dessert- chocolate pudding was good too
My only grouse was that drinks were way too pricey ($15+), even for the setting
$30 for a flavored mojito is highway robbery anywhere in Manhattan, leave alone the LES, imho

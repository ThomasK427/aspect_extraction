The food is good, and they are generous with cooked food, but forget about the TUNA
They never put out tuna
(They keep refilling the rolls, shrimp, etc, but for tuna you have to ASK
Then they give you ONE PIECE
Or, if they are nice, two
If you ask for more than 2 pieces, they say come back later
) I've been there many many times (weekends, holidays, weekdays, winter, spring, etc) and it's always been like this
There's always a mad undignified dash for tuna, which is so stingy of them
Update: I tried the Long Island location and it's better!
not stingy like the Manhattan location
Minado is a much needed establishment in a city like Manhattan where the price of food could run one's financial well dry
If you can bring yourself to pay the $27 a person price, be sure to eat your sushi and japanese food's worth
They have a wide variety of hot / cold food, desserts, and seafood
The restaurant itself is spacious and the service is attentive and friendly
a place you can recommend to friend(s)
The services are good
This restaurant is really a good place to eat, because it is clean, foods are excellent
It is like you are at home
Very good
The food is great and the restaurant itself is very well decorated however one of the owner's (Michelle Ling), needs to take classes on how to run a business
I eat at this reaturant at least once a week
I either sit and eat at the restaurant, or order take out
Keep in mind that whenever I go I rave about how good the place is and I've must have recommended it to at least a dozen different people
Not to mentiont, that I've always gone w/ someone different
The last time I went we were a party of 6 and we spent in total $450
the place was packed as always! Would you beleive that after we paid for the check, Michelle Ling (part owner) had the nerve to come to my table and politely asked that I leave because she had some people waiting at the bar!!! Can you imagine after spending all that money!! Upon leaving my bf decided to speak to Michelle (owner/hostess)
he was there for a good 20 min and all she can say was that she had to because she had the people at the bar yelling at her
that they'd been sitting there for like 3 hrs (we were only there for 1 1/2)
Here's a tip how about letting walk ins know that it can be a while or politely turn them down
I don't make reservations so I can be told to leave after 1 1/2
After he argued that it we just got done spending all this money and she was completely wrong regardless of how much we sepnt she had the audacity to tell him yeah well that party of 12 just spent $900!!! I mean talk about not knowing how to run a business
I remember when this place first opened and reservations weren't necessary
Now she thinks just because business has significantly increased she can speak to those that pay her bills in the manner in which she had
I don't so
So before you make your reservations you may want to make sure Michelle Ling is not working that night
she may ask you to leave once you're through paying her bills
I went to Fusha with a bunch of friends recently, and the place was divine
The food was perfect (try the hot red snapper!!), and not too costly, and the drinks were awesome
we had the Lichido cocktails, which I highly recommend!!! Magical
I was a real fan of this place when they opened
It's been truly disheartening to experienced a steep decline in quality and price increases of 20% over the last year alone! I even had to return a couple of dishes twice on their delivery
There is better options in the area than this eclectic Pan-Asian proposal
My husband and I went for my birthday and had a great time
Everyone was friendly and the food was very good and beautifully presented
Definetly worth the cost, which is reasonable to begin with
The waiters sang happy birthday and brought me some complimentary fried green tea ice cream, which was delicious
The hostess, Michelle, reserved a comfortable table for us and was really great about us changing the reservation to an hour later
Absolutely worth going!
A ery good place for dine in take out
Very friendly warm services provided
We had a wonderful party here
evryone enjoyed the food and the services provided
definitely will go back to this restaurant
they have a very attractive lunch menu
reasonable price and cozy environment
I gambled on the reviews and the location and after being there and experiencing the food and ambiance it was a gamble worth taking
As soon as we walked in we were promptly seated
The hostesses were very pleasant as was our waiter
The decor was very cool and asian, by the front door a section of the wall is tiled with Majong game tiles! Because we were both very hungry we went straight for the sushi for two and it was well justified and priced right
And as a side note, the restrooms were cool with the pushbutton toilet and the glass bowl sink
I used to live around the corner from this place and ate there again recently
And although I've noticed that the prices have gone up a little since they opened, it's still a great menu
The Indian Dipping Pancake and the Seafood Hot Pot are great if you like coconut curry flavors
The Wasabi roll and the Crunchy Spicy Tuna/Salmon rolls are fresh and just the right amount of spicy
The specials are always interesting and presented very well
Great place if you can't decide on Thai or Japanese
I recently been invited to my friend, Bellinda's birthday party at Fusha
It was so good
The foods were authentic, served in a perfect temperature depends on what kind you ordered
Bellinda and all of us had great foods and great times
They have very very nice house hot-served specialties, sushi bar specials and even full-bar services
It was just a great place for any occasions or parties
The manager, Michelle and her waitstaff were so helpful and very nice, too
We will soon be back there for our luch, dinner and another party
and definitely will tell people and bring more friends!
The other thing I love about Fusha is that they always upgrade their variety of foods
So not like others that claimed their foods are the greatest but they serve same food for months and months
However, here is Fusha you will feel the real Asian dinning
It's true that the place a little too tight, but you could always coem between 5:30pm to 7:30pm and you'll have all the space that you always wanted
In Short This California-based chain churns out more than 20 kinds of fruit smoothies from behind cheerily colorful pink, green and yellow facades
Pick from ingredients that include fresh fruit, veggies, nonfat frozen yogurt, soy milk and dairy-free sherbet
Or order the Coldbuster, a blend of orange juice, peaches, bananas and 2,000 percent of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C
In addition to smoothies, it also offers a short menu of soups, low-fat breads and pretzels
THE WORST SMOOTHIE that I've ever had!! The service is the same as any fast food place where they really don't care
The juice is from a machine (!!!!) and NOT FRESH and LOADED WITH SUGAR!! I requested fresh pineapple juice and they did not have it
STAY AWAY FROM THESE UNHEALTHY DRINKS!!!
New York finally has the california bohemia smoothie company called Jamba Juice
Expect to pay Starbucks kind of prices for drinks and then some
People flock to this chain in the summertime like people flock to Starbucks during wintertime or a rainy day
The smoothies are rich in flavor and you can even try a energy booster in your drink if you are daring
Philly Slim's offers a new fast food flavor to the Hell's Kitchen 'hood
The boys know how to makea Philadelphia style cheesesteak
Your choice of cheeses, althought the Cheese Whiz is the traditional choice
They could use a few more options in sides
A salad would be good
Or a slaw or potato salad
The hoagies are fresh and chewy
And if they had a whole wheat roll, I'd be taking it! Meanwhile: Go for the sandwich with the works: mushrooms, onions, peppers, cheese
And you can share with a friend
Place is for a quick eat in at high stool / high tables or even better to carry out

The $10 cocktails didn't have much alcohol content in them
All the sake drinks are over $10
We decided to leave because we are all hungry and thirsty after 2 hours
They handed us a bill with 20% gratity already counted in
I guess we didn't have a choice to complain about the slow service, ha!
I've been to the Wild Lily's after a friend's recommendation
The place is simply fantastic; earthy, relaxing, nice and balanced environment with great layout, serving good quality tea (retailing them as well), great sweet and savory small assortments (I got the assorted cookies which were little jewels in presentation as well as taste), good and polite service, nice music in a low tone
But here's the thing; there was that whirr sound which was highly distracting and annoying some short of air-conditioner or whatever causes it, which was the only flaw!  But that shouldnt cow you; Wild Lily Tea Room is simply extraordinary
The way the Au Lait was served just simple and yummy
My friend got the Green pop-corn roasted Tea which was remarkable
Please don't tell anyone about the best meetings spot in NYC for friends
The food is amaxing, underpriced and the ambience is incredible
I'm worried other New Yorker's are going to find out about this little Chelsea place, because to date, I have always found a seat
Every friend I have brought there has been in awe
It is amazing
A friend and I had to experience a bit of a wait at Wild Lily, but the pleasant ambiance and the adorable goldfish at the indoor pond kept us amused and occupied
The waitstaff decided to give us one of the reserved tables, despite being told we would have a considerable wait ahead of us
The teas and their descriptions sound like poetry
And the service, from the clever lily pad tiered tea party plates to the wonderful details in how they served their tea (in very distinctive tea pots, based on the tea you order), made for a very pleasant afternoon tea
The owner of Wild Lily really pays attention to detail at Wild Lily
She travels to Japan, Hong Kong and other locations to purchase only the best teas
In addition to this, her staff is well trained to prepare each variety of tea
The focus at Wild Lily is an excellent tea experience, and is highly recommended if you want an excellent cup of tea
The dedication and intention of the owner alone makes a visit here worth it
The food and tea selection are both excellent; the decor with the fish pond is unusual and interesting
However, the service is usually disinterested, slow, forgetful, and unhelpful--and occasionally downright rude
If you go ever go there and there is a wait for tables, don't expect them to want you to stick around
TSalon is much better
I literally felt a better person for going! A very relaxed setting with great original food (such as the black sticky rice risotto) and service knowledgeable about the tea selection
Last night, my best friend and I went to the Chelsea Square
It was one of the best meals I've had since we moved here 4 months ago
My friend got the Chicken Caesar wrap and I got the veggie burger with fries
Both were AMAZING
(The fries were especially good, and the homemade honey mustard dressing was awesome
) We also split the potato skins appetizer (yum)
I got a coke and dessert (fluffy, light tiramisu) as well
For all of this food, the bill was $30-- and they did NOT skimp on the portions
Our waiter was very nice and apologised when our meals took a bit of time to come out
He also kept our water glasses full (and they use large glasses, unlike most NYC diners) and kept checking up on us without being intrusive
Tip: sit in the window section and watch the people go by
This is the spot for a great meal, with regards to portions and quality! ! I usually dont eat seafood at diners
but here it was UNBELIEVABLY tasty and FRESH!
I'm a regular there
and I always enjoy my meals there
The word here is bland--there's nothing gourmet about this all-purpose Greek diner, where the servers are uncomprehending and the ancient hostess hates you, no matter who you are
Stick with the basics (and stay away from the extra un-salty matzo ball soup) and you'll get a good value--eggs, burgers, fries and coffee won't disappoint
Point is, you can sit here all day watching Chelsea's parade of dogs outside and no one will care
That, in NY, is priceless
In Short While two rainbow flags and a bizarre painting (envisioning Aphrodite and Cupid as a chubby Kate Hepburn and a baby-bodied Bette Davis) hint at it's gay-friendliness and camp sensibility, this is a true blue diner at heart
The four page menu crams hundreds of choices, from Fra Diavolo, to basic breafast fare, to two-dozen hamburger varieties
It's late night hours draw a crowd
Outstanding
Well that depends what you are looking for, Eros offers great food at great prices with great service and in the company of great people
The decor is warm and inviting and the menu offers you too many choices, so you might have a problem making up your mind
If this happens all I can offer you is the option to take a menu home, take all the time you need, and give them a call for delivery
The service is great, fast and friendly
When the weather is mild take advantage of the outdoor seating, as you will find that there may be nothing better, than enjoying a great Eros meal, out in the sun
But, like I said before, It depends what it is your looking for
If your looking for a great diner, without all the cliches of a diner, you've got the spot right here
Don't be fooled - the Eros Cafe is a Diner
Expect to wait for a table on weekends - not because the food is outstanding, but because theres sidewalk seating, cheap prices and proximity to Chelsea shops
While the waiters are friendly here, they make no attempt to actually be good at what they do
I go there only because I live across the street but diner be warned: DO NOT GO TO EROS IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY
The service is ridiculously slow
I have waited as much as 30 minutes for someone to take my order, and you can expect to wait as long for a check
You'll have to get up and go search for your waiter for a refill or anything else
If you've got hours to wait for cheap average diner food than Eros is the place for you
Try the Galaxy or Venus Diners
I went to Eros Cafe for brunch this afternoon
It took the waiter forever to come get our order, after trying to flag him down several times
The waiter did not even offer to bring us coffee while we waited
A while after he took our order, he comes back to confirm the order, which probably meant that he hadn't turned in our order yet
We didn't get water or coffee refills, and to get our check, we had to again flag the waiter down several times too
Food wasn't anything special either--it was definitely not worth the wait!
Low marks for both food and service
The word chicken was barely out of my mouth when the waiter rushed away from my table without asking me about side orders or a drink
I've seen hurried servers before, but never one who showed me his back as fast as this one
He also seemed surprised by my order, as if he'd never heard of it
The chicken was pathetic -- dry and stringy
It looked like it had been under a heat lamp all day
And -- to paraphrase the old joke -- the portion was so small
They seemed to be doing okay business, which boggles my mind
Maybe it's the luck of having a great location
This place is great for a satisfying meal in a rush
The service is very friendly and helpful
I love eating here!
The Scene This family-friendly restaurant and watering hole is as well-lit as a diner, but their live Dixieland bands are on point seven nights a week
The business-casual crowd packs into the booth and bar area after work to sip Hurricanes, which are as syrupy sweet as the kind that are peddled on Bourbon Street
The Food Standard Cajun dishes are geared toward the more delicate Manhattanite palate--so if you like it hot, be sure to specify the level of heat you can handle
The crawfish etouffee is smothered in a rich brown roux, but the traditionally fiery stew is surprisingly mild
Seafood jambalaya brings more of a kick, while the tender, densely flavored blackened catfish is your best bet
Though the beignets aren't quite as light and lovely as the famous fritters from New Orleans' Cafe Du Monde, they still make a nice complement to the Cajun Coffee, spiked with apple brandy
I went to Cajun's on a Monday night so I didn't know what to expect
My date and I were promptly seated when we got there and our waitress was ready to take our orders
Our meals were a moderate portion and they weren't too spicy
The other patrons were warm and often smilled and nodded as they walked by our table so it felt a bit surreal
The band played everything from lowkey to upbeat selections and even featured a vocalist at one point

It was good, old-fashioned New Orlean's jazz
Prices were reasonable considering that entertainment was included

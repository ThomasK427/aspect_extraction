After complaining, he brought a corrected check, and we paid our bill
But then he came back, having added items we never ordered! We sent the check back AGAIN! We left, leaving cash in the amount we thought would cover the check
The whole check experience took nearly 45 minutes
Management should've offered us a round of cocktails while we waited, but instead chose to fight with our waiter in front of us
A TRULY AWFUL EXPERIENCE!
Great crowd, the type that hits the top spots but leaves to the newer places fast
Great food, good drinks and marvelous service rounded-up a great evening
Highly recommended
I went to Lucy for my office holiday lunch
I think I would have rather gone there for dinner because their lunch menu was a bit limited
The cocktails were fantastic
For lunch I had the Carnitas de Puercos (pork tacos), which was a bit bland and the portions are kind of small dont expect to chow down
All three quesadillas (mushroom, chicken and chorizo) we got from the lunch menu were really tasty
Lucy is more of a restaurant to go to for the ambience rather than for the food
I think it would be a great place to go to after work to have some great drinks and order a bunch of appetizers
Atmosphere and food were great and I highly recommend trying this mexican alternative
Service is a bit slow, but the wait staff is curteous and friendly which helps make up for it
The Barbacoa is amazing, and the hot chocolate is a must have for any serious chocolate lover
I went to Lucy's for a birthday dinner
The service was not very good
The waitstaff were friendly but useless
It took FOREVER to get to get both appetizers and entrees and while the mexican bbq was good, the appetizer wasn't anything special
The room is pretty but it's quite pricey
I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon
Went there for dinner last night, and ended up sitting there until midnight
The ambiance is great
And food is quite tasty
Lucy is more than just plain Mexican
It goes far beyond Bbq
Part Suenos, part Gramercy Tavern, Lucy is a large modern space with ridiculously good food
This high end Mexican puts Dos Caminos to shame
Go for the apple roasted salmon or the bbq chicken
Slow but attentive staff
Professional and attractive crowd (30-40 somethings, sans baby)
Dinner for two won't cut into the rent money
($120 cost for two entrees, two martinis, appetizer and tip)
If you're looking for a heavy meal
don't expect it here
The food portions are small
It's almost tappas size
The couple next to me had to order an additional entry after their meal
The food is good, just not enough for the price they charge you
They also absolutely do not make exceptions on their menu
So if you want a side of plantains with your meal, well you better order the entree that has plantains because they don't offer it on the side of anything else
I went for dinner at Lucy the other night with five friends and it was the best experience I've had in a long time
The sangria may be the best I've ever had
We started out with guacamole which was a little too spicy but delicious
After that we had some tasting plates which were really good
The best was the chorizo quesadilla
Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu
For dessert I think we tried everything
The fondue was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten in my life
It's cinnamon chocolate flavored and so good I would have drank it by itself!! The little bunuelos were also very delicious with the sesame cream
They just melted in your mouth
I would go back just for them
All in all my friends and I had an amazing experience and will definitely be back soon
The service is very slow and the taco portions are very small and the taco shells very soggy
In Mexico, at least when the service is slow, one has a steady stream of margarita's or Corona's and chips (and not the $6 option you actually have to order) to pass the time and develop a good enough buzz not to care about the service
Lucy's seems to be trying to capitalize on downhome with an upscale attitude
I'd recommend San Loco in the E
Village if you want a real taco in NY
I used to go to Chicama but I was never impressed, so when I heard that re-open as Lucy with a new chef, I could not wait to try it
It was a wonderful experience
The food was great, the quesadillas and one of the ceviches as appetizers were very good and just the right size, for entrees we had the Lamb and the Bistec both were delicious, dessert Chocolate for two
The service was very proffecional and attentive
The place makes you feel very comfortable and warm
As a Mexican restaurant, much more than one expects
Well, happy to say that Lucy's was great
Went for a business lunch and was treated to great service and a great atmosphere
Waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was incredibly attentive to our tables needs
I had the Mexican grill, and everything was well prepared and exceptionally spiced
For desert, dont miss out on the coconut flan, it was great
Definitely a step above Chicama
I walked in thinking this place would be better than Chicama, but I was SLOWLY misktaken
After it took 20 minutes to get the waiter's attention, it took another 20 minutes for chips and salsa and salad
Then, we ordered two tasting appetizers as our entrees which took another half an hour
After one bite of the food, it was apparent that the place is totally bogus
It then took another 20 minutes to get the check
In front of us sat a bunch of dorks playing a game as if they were in a lower class version of Tortilla Flats
Lucy is much more open and inviting than Chicama, which use to occupy the space
The lounge is a great place to meet up with people
The food was suprisingly good
In general I was very happy with my experience
The Scene If diners feel like they're in someone's living room, it's because the bi-level spot is an extension of owners Jack and Grace Lamb's residence
The casual red-and-white checked downstairs walls turn to a muted olive in the upstairs kitchen, then to a graceful ivory in the elegant 12-seat upper dining room
The moldings, tasseled drapes and cozy fireplace make the space so intimate that each of the stylish guests feel like your dining companion
The Food Chef Maxime Bilet remains faithful to the restaurant's signature "deconstructed" oysters Rockefeller and keeps the lobster Newburg mercifully light
More importantly, he makes his own mark with knock-out originals like thick, caramelized scallops in a nutty, velvety pistachio and artichoke sauce; silky, refreshingly cold foie gras with sour cherries; and a rich chicory creme brulee
Diners can also rely on swimmingly fresh raw bar selections like shelled Maine lobster, littleneck clams and East and West Coast oysters
I went to Jack's last night with my boyfriend
We both had the tasting menu
The food was outstanding
I was a bit worried after seeing some of the reviews here but was happily surprised
The atmosphere was great although I can see how it might get too crowded
I found the staff to be attentive and accommodating
When I requested that they seat us upstairs they happily obliged even though our reservation was for downstairs
The food was extremely fresh and I loved that we could see it being prepared
This was a great dining experience we will definitely go back
I tried both these places because of what I've read about 2 years ago, terrible, if not worse than jewel Bako, the prices are crazy for the small tiny miniscule amout of food they serve not to mention the quality
They use the whole homestyle feel with a small space to be special

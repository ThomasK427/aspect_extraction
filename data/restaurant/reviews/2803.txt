Their service is terrible
They slammed the glasses of water after I have asked a refill 2 times since they couldn't here me even though the place was empty
As I was paying the bill, the waiter would look over my shoulder to see how much tip I would be giving as where I could almost feel him breathing on my ear
If you want some cheap noodle soup, this is a decent place to go for a quick eat
Don't even think about getting some good service
Not that I've been everywhere in Queens, but after recently moving from Manhattan, I feel blessed to have found this pearl in Elmhurst, one of many Vietnamese restaurants in the area
Their seafood is fresh and delicious and their service is personalized, friendly, and unpretentious
This is not a fancy place, but it's good quality, clean, and varied enough to eat several times a week: always healthy and well-prepared, and always full of Vietnamese clientele
If you'd like to try something exotic, try the salted crab and the durian shake
(Mmmm
)
One of the Best Thai restaurants in NYC
If you like tasty and spicy food, this is the place to go
I have tried many Thai places in NYC, and not many have been able to match the food here
Nice variety of food at a reasonable price makes me keep coming back here
This is pizza heaven! Pizza is sooo good
I'm sure each one is filled with about a week's worth of calories and fat
But go for it, it's delicious
They make it fresh right when you order, little personal pizzas
I work really close and its so hard not to eat it more often
The setting is just ok, pretty much your local pizza place setting
But you gotta try the pizza!
awesome pizza great toppings!!!!!!  try alot of new locations!!! yea baby
I started coming here about a year ago, and the service wasn't too great
I eventually started eating here regularly though, and I'm very pleased
Their food is fresher than most diners I've been to, and the staff is friendly
The food is amazing for the price, and on top of that, it's open 24 hours
Even when there are a lot of customers, they have more than enough seating, so I never had to wait to be seated
Kay is the nastiest person to ever walk this earth
Make sure you request a table or booth that is not served by Kay
She is sick as the manager told me after I complained
I've been to many diners all across NYC, and this is by far one of the better ones
However, the other day my wife and I sit down for breakfast and quickly give the waiter our order
After a minute or so we discover the breeze from the front door is rather cold
We asked the manager if he can move us to another table
Even though the place was more than half empty he refused to do so because we had already given our order to the waiter and a change of tables would cause too much confusion
What kind of GARBAGE is that?! Isn't the customer always right? What a JERK! Needless to say, we had our breakfast elsewhere
Will we go there again, probably
The food is good, and we won't let one bad apple spoil the batch
But next time we'll choose our seating more wisely
My friend and I made the trek from Manhattan to Queens today to go to Target
After spending some time out there we got hungry and popped across the street to the Georgia Diner
The place turned out to be exactly what we'd been hoping for: a cheap place that could provide us with something a little different from any city diner
The menu is a little ambitious (I doubt one could order any of the seemingly few hundred entrees and expect it to be memorable), but that is the charm of this place
It is a suburban diner that reminds me of the places we would go after a late night out in the Midwest
The service wasn't amazing, but it was good for us
Just watch out for the excess mayo
It was such a horrible experience
The service was the worst and the wait was 45 mins for lousy food
Save your money and do not bother with this diner
let me tell you
this place has the best chicken in town
for 7 bucks you get half a chicken with french fries or rice and a side of salad
Also there hot sauce (aji) is so delicious, dip your fries on the hot sauce and thats all you need, but add the chicken with the salad, man its pretty darn good
Did I mention the salad dressing is the bomp too
I go there once a week and I definetly recommend this place
When you order steamed fish you expect the fish to be steamed properly and it should be fresh
So we ordered the steam sea bass
It comes out and the meat is pretty tough and there wasnt a fresh smell to it
we told the waitress and she told us that we ordered the dead fish as opposed to the swimming fish
she tells us the already dead fish is the fish that costs 14
95 while the swimming fish costs more than that per pound
first of all
why the hell would any place serve fish that isnt fresh? 2nd, the option wasnt given
The waiters kept telling us that we didnt order the swimming fish
but who in their right mind would want to order the fish that is not fresh? What a disappointing end to such a great meal otherwise
stay away from this place and itsrude staff
The food here is just like it was in Thailand
Don't be put off by the fact that it is in a strip mall
You haven't had authentic Thai food until you come to this place
These guys definitely don't skimp on the spices and the place is always filled with locals who love the food
There are dishes here that I've never seen in any other Thai place, even in Chinatown
My favorites are the raw shrimp smothered in lime and raw garlic on a bed of chopped carrots and their assortment of boneless duck
Great prices for the quality AND quantity
It's a small place, but seating is very fast
Very authentic dishes
Try their Lobak (array of fried tofu, chicken rolls, shrimp crackers) and their Satays
Also their delicious tropical drinks, like Coconut Juice or Sugarcane Drink
Not so trendy but great if looking for a quick dinner with good food
Their single serving pizza are so delicious! The toppings are good and the crust is nice and crispy
It tasted wonderful
The service was great and the environment was clean
The neighborhood area is OK
The single servings can be shared between 2 ppl but if you're a big eater
1 pie is enough! enjoy!
they make single serving (or double) pies
I love the special, lots of toppings, try chicken and jalepeno mmmm endless ways to top yours they taste best when you eat them fresh
This place is a landmark in Queens
This bakery has been around for years for obvious reasons, the cakes are delicious and the pastries are better than any I've tried in any bake shop
They have the creamiest cheesecake, any they offer a large selection of toppings (strawberry, blueberry, pineapple) for the cheesecakes which are so tasty
If you live in Queens, then you probably have already been here, but if not, definetly try it out
While the shop lacks style, they more than make up for it in quality, which is excellent
We've been buying our (Jewish) holiday baked goods here for nearly five years and they always get rave reviews from our guests--or our hosts, when *we* are the guests
The dining room is small but mirrors allow for an airy feeling
Majority of seating is booth style, which allows some privacy
Restaurant has right and left side; you won't be sittin elbow to elbow with anyone
Superfast delivery so definitely order in
By the time you hang up the phone and get your wallet, your bell is ringing
The best brocolli w/garlic sauce anywhere
I've been a customer of Tung Shing House for over 5 years

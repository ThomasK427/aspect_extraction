There's also a rotating art selection, with sometimes very beautiful pieces
Excellent option and highly recommended
Highly recommended for their great food at very reasonable prices
Cute atmosphere and the staff is great
Now has outdoor seating in the back!
i really want to like this cafe since it brings a welcomed alternative to tavernas in astoria
the atmosphere is cozy, the service is helpful inviting plus you can almost always get a seat
the problem is that the menu has far too few options
i've been 3 times ordered the same thing each time because the menu does not change or give me wide variety of choices
The first time I tasted an ice from this place, I was blown away
Childhood memories of spending summers with my grandmother in Puerto Rico came back
Made with real fruit and fresh ingredients these are by far the best ices in NYC!
If you want REAL GENUINE tropical island flavor, this is your shop
DELICIOUS TROPICAL ICES IN MANY ISLAND FRUITS FLAVOR! Once you've tried them, you'll never try anyone else
This is one of my favorite places to eat
The food is inexpensive, tastes great and very colorful
The staff on the floor provides great service with a smile and the kitchen staff gets your food to you quickly
There is always seating available and the atmosphere is great
Chef Peter How brings to you the diverse food culture of Southeast Asian
The food iss very delicious
I highly recommend you bring more friend to enjoy the food
I like the  Coconut Prawn
They recently expanded their menu
Not one wine over $20 and all good
Great place to bring a date or just to chat with a friend
Nectar has the best smoothies and wraps I've ever had
I've tasted different ones around the country, and really, I think Nectar is the best
I go in almost every day for a chicken and blue cheese wrap and a Mangolicious Smoothie
I only wish they'd open up one by my office in Manhattan!
My wifie and I use to live in the SF Bay area where Jamba Juice's were almost as common as Starbuck's
We became hooked on smoothies and missed them living out here
We have been so happy with Nectar opening in our 'hood and believe their quality is actually better than Jamba Juice's (they use milk or juice as their base instead of ice)
Their food (salad's especially) is also delicious and the guys that work there are cool
The menu is pretty diverse, and they give decent portions
The food is pretty good too, if you're looking for no-frills diner food
Delivery is fast and well packaged
But it's difficult to order because of the very heavy accent of anyone who answers the phone -- and it's caused errors in the order
Open 24 though, and the full menu seems to be always available
In Short Bed-Stuy is home to this exciting African entertainment venue, art gallery and bistro
From the unique artwork, film screenings, live music--from acoustic to DJ--and kind staff, this place is a true original
The inspiring decor--complete with a handle sculpted "Senoufo" bench and a huge statue of an African goddess--is the proper backdrop for unique menu standouts like the lamb shank, the "Pepe soup" with silver fish and the apple and mango galette
+Well as i walked into the restrant it was beatiful! it brought outtrue african culture! the service was great with friendly people i enjoyed the music the laughs and my yolele cocktail it is truley amazing you should go there i know i loved it!
VERY CLEAN ,THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS,THEAMBIANCE IS VERY WARM  YOU MUST TRY
We had a wonderful dinner here, the food was really good, traditional Italian fare with imaginative touches, but not overly exotic or inventive
Service was excellent and attentive - we were late, and called ahead, and they held our reservation and greeted us warmly
Recommend the filet mignon carpaccio, and wild mushroom appetizer
Winelist not great, but adequate
Nice neighborhood place to have a good meal without having to travel too far - good place to take visitors
My husband and I were there this past weekend with our toddler and had a very nice dinner
The staff was accomodating towards our daughter and nice enough to check up on her after they served dinner (I was a little concerned about the spices and they suggested a dish)
Needless to say the food was wonderful and they were patient and graceful towards our toddler (who was making a big mess w/the sugar packets food)! I will deff be back w/the family as well as a big appetite
Whether you are on the fence about trying Indian food, or a die-hard fan, you will come to love Taj Mahal
The food is authentic and flavorful - just the right herbs and spices are used
Each dish is sure to please, no matter what you choose
My favorite is the Chicken Vindaloo- I have searched the city and nothing can compare to Taj's Vindaloo! Of course you have to try their breads - piping hot and fresh from the oven
Trust me, as far as Indian is concerned, you will not find anything better
No reservations needed, the place is never packed or overcrowded (but there are always just enough regulars around to enjoy the food and service)
Tip: Parking is a nightmare, but the food is worth the hassle
Enjoy!
After trying this one in the 6th St row, I stopped sampling inexpensive Indian restaurants because I realized that this is it
The food is excellent, especially the appetizers (Channa Poori, Samosa, Channa Bhaji)
Many vegetarian choices
You can order wine, but I found that beer is better with this type of food
I have brought many friends to have dinner here and they all have been impressed
Very friendly staff, especially the guy who stands outside in the cold beckoning passersby
Went for dinner and it was amazing! Cozy restaurant, loved the ambience
But the food is what will keep me coming back
They start you off with a delicious flat bread, which they call a wafer, with 2 different sauces and tomatoes
Don't know what the sauces were but they were yummy, will ask when I go back
You must try the Samosa appetizer
My entree was one of the specials, a lamb dish
Portion sizes are just right
Not too much, not too little
Only downfall was the waiter that we had
Not very friendly and did not come back to check on us once, the tail end of the meal we were serviced by another much more friendly waiter
and not because we complained, they just switched mid-service, that to me, was unprofessional
But I will return, just for the food!!! And the prices are great also!
In Short Carnival prizes, a mermaid mural, wood planks and aqua blue tiles decorate this petite shop opened by Coney Island native Donnie Gonzalez
His specialties include burgers, from mini-sized Coasters to the Mondo, a one-pounder, as well as cheesesteaks, a Surf Avenue clam roll and the Coney--a foot-long kosher frank dressed with a choice of 20 toppings
Clam chowder, fish-and-chips, and breaded scallops are among the other seaside eats, joined by chili cheese fries, corn dogs and knishes
I've been going to Coney's since they first opened a few years ago
The staff is very close knit and funky and you feel like your walking into a mom and pop shop with a freak show Coney Island hipster twist
The walls are lined with carnival toys, and a painted mural of mermaids swimming under the Coney Island boardwalk
With juicy fresh beef burgers for the carnivore, they even have a massive one pound burger, chunky clam chowder, to barbequed vegetarian cheesesteak sandwiches, there is a meal for every taste
Just make sure you get the double cripsy fries
mmm mmm good! Coney's is a small fast food joint in the heart of Williamsburg that will fill your stomach and not empty your wallet
With the decor ranging from drag queen barbie dolls to Yankee/Met memorabilia, you can see the likes of Frank Sinatra to Gene Simmons eating here!
Coffee, sandwiches and homey baked goods to satisfy daytime cravings
In Short A cheerful palette of mild orange walls, vibrant green chairs and pink floral-patterned oilcloth on the tables brightens the mood at this tiny Williamsburg cafe and bakery
Neighborhood residents stop in for sandwiches and daily soups, or to pick up oven-fresh treats such as lemon pound cake, coffee cake and chocolate banana turnovers
i only started going to this place about 3 months ago, but it now ranks among my all time favorites
forget hangover cure, brunch will cure whatever ales you, american comfort food with a twist
the best french toast i have ever had be prepared to wait a little while, the place is small dinner is another delight, and you rarely have to wait for a table
keeping it simple with a strictly pasta entree, but each is handmade fresh at the shop, and it's all pre-fixe!
My boyfriend and I stopped in for brunch spontaneously and walked out more than happy we chose to pop in! The cook (who I think is the owner) greeted us when we came in and made sure we were taken care of immediately
I had an omelette and my boyfriend had the steak and eggs
The steak and eggs were delicious! The omelette was good and so were the biscuits and potatos
This is my new favorite brunch spot!
Living on this side of the BQE, we non-Bedfod Williamsburgonians do not have the full selection of shops, bars, and restaurants that are offered a subway stop away
Luckily we have the Hope Union Cafe as the greatest go-to for a sensational coffe house retreat

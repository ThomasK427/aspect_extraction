Lovely setting, fantastic food and live music make for a fun and romantic evening
I go M-W for quiet dinners in a beautiful setting
Th-Sat
the drinks are cool and the music is hot
If you are looking for good service and pleasant hostesses, this is not the place for you
During my visit, the orders were taken hours after my arrival and the hostess seemed uninterested in servicing us
They are more interested in making the almighty dollar than aquiring longtime patrons
The hostess didn't greet me at the door, I found my own seating, the restaurant appeared nice, but not the atmosphere
I was there as part of an annual girlfirends brunch on 12/27/2003
We had reservations for noon and when I arrived, I unable to sit because the table was not ready
Upon finally sitting, no water or bread was offered
Finally, a half an hour later we were given one pitcher of water for a table of 18 people
At around 2 pm we ordered but no kind of food was ever served
Mind you this was two hours later
I, as well as, the rest of the group was very disappointed
The staff was very rude and inefficient
I would not recommend
We made reservations for a party of 25
The venue was utterly unprepared
They had only one waitress on staff who was incredibly slow, unattentive and rude
After 2 hours will still had not been served
The drinks were over priced and watered down
They don't have baby seats
The staff there insulted my family and friends
Our holiday gathering was ruined
They have no business being in the hospitality industry!
Minar is a tiny place more for people who work nearby and want a quick lunch
No service, no ambience
You have to get a platter of food, just like in a food court
They also have menu options, and the food is very very good
It tastes like homemade Indian food (I am Indian, so I know)
I would not recommend their samosa chat, though
But the food is delicious, and perfect for a quick meal, especially lunch
If you do try out the food in their menu, the mysore masala dosa is ultra spicy (yummy!), so beware! And it is very cheap
The Scene The entrance leads into a dim, narrow bar decorated with sake bottles, exposed brick and a beautiful arched wooden ceiling
The dining room alongside is brighter, thanks to a big picture window and glowing yellow orbs of light
A tastefully eclectic mix of music, ranging from Tom Waits to Duke Ellington, entertains locals who seem delighted to have stumbled upon the inconspicuous spot
The Food Gourmet twists are given to simple Japanese dishes with even simpler prices
Sesame seeds add a nutty hint to sweet, thinly shredded burdock, while extremely finely diced salmon, avocado, shallots and wasabi combine for a wonderfully textured tartare
Tomato ponzu sauce provides a sweet and spicy punch to cigarillo-sized spring rolls, and a spicy mayo turns rock shrimp tempura into a Japanese spin on Cajun popcorn
The tasting-sized portions are especially convenient for a quick bite before an East Village barhop
This place is way overrated
Food is negligible, portions small, and prices definitely not cheap
Their sake collection is extensive but no bargain
Oh, and the fried oysters which someone highly recommended, were greasy, weirdly shaped, and $9 for 3, to add insult to injury
Skip this place and go somewhere where they serve real Japanese food
This is an excellent restaurant, the service is out of this world
There seems to be good communication amongst the staff and that gives a very good impression
Managers are very helpful and very service oriented
It is a great place to spend a wonderful time
Kasadela is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
I go at least once a week because I can't get enough of the nori, black edamame, shitake tempura and chicken wings
The ambience is great and the staff is always friendly and helpful
I highly recommend this place
Friendly, unassuming place/restaurant for small plate Japanese dishes
Despite the small plates, it's very inexpensive and you can get a full, interesting, and very tasty meal here for not alot of money
The staff is very friendly and helpful
Definitely worth taking the walk to the outer reaches of the East Village for this destination, I know I'll be doing so again
This Japanese bar food saki bar is low-key and the food and drinks taste great
This place is such a gem--The food is unique and delicious; the service impeccable; the ambiance/style of the restaurant great; and it being the EV, the price is right--very reasonable
I love the fact that there isn't some horrible Japanese music track playing or cheesy rice paper lights or any of the other usual boring Japanese restaurant decorations
Instead, there is great music and nice decor
It is both perfect for dinner with three friends and dinner with a romantic partner
The portions and styling of the food make sharing the perfect way to enjoy the food
As mentioned, the prices reasonable-both the food and the house sakes, which, even the cheaper ones are excellent
I love everything about this place--I especially like to take out of towners here as it is everything a little NYC restaurant should be
My fiance and I have been there for dinner since the restaurant first opened
We have introduced many friends to it and everyone LOVES Kasadela
The food is absolutely divine
The chicken wings are to die for
The fried oysters are the best I've had my life
Every dish is done extremely well, from recipe to ingredients to cooking technique
And it definitely does not hurt to have a great sake menu to go with the food
And the people there are absolutely not pretentious and so nice to us every time
Great for groups, or if you're trying to impress that special someone! This place has only been getting better since we first started going last fall
This japanese izakaya is a great place to share food and drink or keep it all to yourself, while hanging out in a relaxed and cozy dimly-lit environment
The decor is simple but elegant, with a beautiful brick wall serving as a divider between the bar and dining areas
The menu continues to involve fresh additions that complement its classics
You can never go wrong, no matter what you order! There or several sake options (size and selection), for those who want to taste and try several different ones, to those who want to share with a group of friends
They now serve wine, in addition to beer and sake
Everything is wonderfully affordable
Note that Kasadela now accepts credit cards (Visa, MC)
*Food: Gourmet Japanese, good sake selection *Setting: Minimalist, casual  A weekly(?) changing menu of tapas (small portions of a specific dish) style japanese food, along with an unpretentious atmosphere make this small resturant a haven for the conisseur of culinary delight
Those who have knowledge of japanese food will be most comfotable as the menu offers few english descriptions- but even a random choice will yeild a truely delicious adventure
From perfect, grease-less tempura to delicate sauces, each plate is a small work of art, the layers of flavors carefully crafted
This small gem is worth the price- a couple will need between 3-5 dishes ranging $8-$14 each for a 'light' meal
Many resturants brag about their gourmet dishes, but few can deliver such a tasty culinary expereince
I read about this, and like that it was touted to be unpretentious
It was a very small spot, and was sort of overshadowed by a nearby restaurant
It does not seem like a place to pick up or people-watch, which is probably why it was completely empty that night
Which is why I was glad that I chose it
The food was absolutely amazing, the cocktails were excellent, the bartender/waiter for the night was very nice
The chef even came out for a galss of wine at the bar
I think this is a great spot for the type of food that usually comes with a snobbish attitude and - without it, and a great place to catch up with a friend
my friend and I accidently discovered this small charming restaurant when we were walking along 5th ave, and were drawn by the vivid red walls
We decided to take a chance, and were so wonderfully suprised, first by the sound of soft jazz from the 50
We began with an incredible gazpacho that was garnished with corn and shrimp, one of the best either of us had ever had
That was followed by a silky salmon in a mustard broth, and piece of cod fish with chorizo sausage and garlic mashed potatoes that was truly mouth watering
We shared one of the most delicious creme brulee's ever
Our one complaint though was that the air conditioning wasn't cool

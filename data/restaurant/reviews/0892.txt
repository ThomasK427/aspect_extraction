Never, ever, will go back there again!
What a wonderfully unique dessert experience
Creative flavors combinations, and MOMA presentations were alone, worth the trip
Look forward to returning with friends soon
Moma or ChikaLicious? Chose to do BOTH! Okay,
tastes great, exquisite presentation, beautiful plates etc
but that's only half the reward
The live creation of the three course meal is what makes this dessert bar my go to spot in Manhattan
Though many choices for wonderful desserts in this city, I find ChikaLicious to be easier on the wallet and vastly more entertaining
ChikaLicious is arguably the most special eatery in NYC
Such care and detail given to everything from the presentation of desserts to the warm greeting at the door
Intricate juxtapositions on flavors are carefully conceived and well executed making it a must for all visiting friends
Truly wonderful
Wow!!! Super time had by ALL! Sit at the counter and watch the chefs whip up your selection before your very eyes
My party was six, but only four could be accomodated , the other two got the table behind us
What absolutely ming-blowing dessert combinations
delicious all!! Will go often, but earlier in the evening to avoid the crowds
Pre-fix menu for $ 12
00, you will have nothing
It's come with two really small dessert and a entree which also small dessert
This is the smallest dessert and the most expensive dessert have I ever had
Don't worth your money for crazy dessert
It's feel nothing for me, even my kids will feel nothing
You might have to eat at least 4 portion of pre-fix menu, so you will feel a little bit full
I just don't understand how this place gets these recommended reveiws
It seems like fake
The idea is good, but the sevice was too slow and portion was extremely small
You can put whole 3 course in your mouth and still eat another spoonful of ice cream
Before I even taste the dessert, it was gone
I think $12
00 is for their many dishes and soap to keep them white
After leaving there, I and my friends has to go to Starbucks for the second round
at first i thought that the prix fix $12 will get you a sample of each of the dessert on the menu list
but unfortunately you only get one
you do however, get a 3 course dessert meal
but the portions are SUPER TINY! the presentation and the taste is superb and original
but don't expect a grand dessert meal
the best thing about this place is the people! the chefs and owners are there full time and they prepare the dessert in front of you while engaging you in small fun talks
they make you feel really special and they really show interest to all their customers
at first i was kinda disappointed by the SUPER TINY size of the meal but after chatting for a while with the owners and chefs, they make me feel that the visit was worth it and i remember saying to them that i will definitely come back
I've been to ChikaLicious twice and LOVE it! Just wish the space is bigger to accomodate more of Chika's fans!   I always order the prix fixe with wine pairing, every dessert I've tried are incredible and full of surprises
Definitely a good place for date (even though you'll sit shoulder to shoulder to the guest at the next table, you won't notice because all your attention will be devoted to the dessert, and hopefully your date!)  Chika reminds me how good Japanese desserts are! Too bad I can't find Meiji yogurt anywhere in the States
My clients wanted Korean food and I was looking for a place in Midtown that was trendy like Soho with great authentic Korean food
I found it at 36 bbq
The bbq meat, seafood platter, and dolsot bipimbab was awesome
My Vegetarian friend liked the japchae and tofu bipimba
The 8 of us had a lot to bbq, and smelled liked bbq when we left
but I guess it's just part of whole experience
My first choice was not available from the menu
Then our steak tartar arrived, it was frozen
The Galbi Short Ribs were delicious, but there was only the equivalent of two ribs
We also ordered a hot pot which was meant to have pork kimchi, after a careful search effort, I was only able to recover 1 small piece of pork that was comprised mainly of fat
The waitress, however, was quite helpful
She took the steak tartar off the bill brought out some extra pork
The overall experience left a lot to be desired
Words can not describe/express how delicious the food is here
bbq items on the menu are a definite MUST! This restaurant offers a beautiful decor, friendly and helpful staff, reasonable prices and it's good for a dates, as well as large groups/private parties
This is one of my most favorite restaurants in the city
this place was awesome!!!
the one thing that made this place so great was the fact that they served FRESH FRESH meat
not frozen like other restaurants
The meat here was soooo tender and delicious
(suggestion- there are diff
beef cuts on the menu- order one serving of each and you can taste test each cut!) Compared to other korean restaurants in the city, this one was reasonably priced, very clean,the decor and atmosphere was trendy yet cozy, and the staff was REALLY polite and accomodating
Highly Recommended- steak tartare (delish!), bbq items
If you want portions, this is not a place for you to eat
It your taste bud is keen to each seasoning then perhaps you will have fun here
Many side dishes slip home-made flares then overly spiced/seasoned mass produced market-bought products
my personal favorite is bibimbop (mixed veggies and beef over rice in a hot stone bowl)
service can improve a bit, but they are pretty new trying
Of all of the Korean BBQ joints in Manhattan, 36-92 is by far the best
36 has the leanest and most diverse types of beef--all so delicious! Don't forget to get the Rock Soju (soju is the korean version of vodka) which comes frozen in a block of ice
a good compliment any korean fare
The kalbi at this restaurant is one of the best I've had at a restaurant
Another positive about this restaurant is that they cook the kalbi above coals, which gives the kalbi a really good flavor
Don't go for any of the dishes except for kalbi
Take the advice from a Korean who loves her kalbi
The best Korean food I have tasted in New York so far
This new (2 weeks) place really has it all
Give it a try and you will be back
I just found it by walking by
The waitress
man, almost embarrasing how much she cared about us
Will be big soon
Avoid this restaurant
The service is poor and very slow
The food was over-salted and poorly prepared on both visits
The food is really not authentic French cuisine
And the prices, especiallly at the bar, were not worth it
It is never crowded and that should tell a story in itself !
The service is SO bad, they take FOREVER and it's NOT busy, which seems like an oxymoront o me
I totally don't even know why people would pay so much money to have such bad tasting French Onion Soup
The bread they put in the soup is hardened, and the restaurant smells of old and stinky fish
The ground is so dusty, they do NOT have clean facilities
The bathroom smells like something DIED in there, and my boyfriend says in the men's room there is urine ALL over the walls and they rarely have soap
The staff takes so long and they often mix up the orders with someone else who is Asian in the restaurant
Personally, as a young Japanese college student they treat Asians and other minorities with no respect
I one time heard two waiters conversing about these African Americans when they were only two tables away
This place is rude, it smells, and the food tastes like it spoiled a week ago
It takes so long for the food to arrive and once it does the waitresses just pop it down and smashes it up in our face

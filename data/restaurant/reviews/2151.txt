All of these people writing reviews must not know what excellent service is
Waiters are kind, food always arrives quickly, and if you go here more than once, the owner (Johnny) will know your name, AND what you drink! I am not old (34), and I appreciate this type of traditional atmosphere that is not stuffy with trendy folks looking to be seen
One comes to Villa Berulia to be treated like family! One of my favorite spots in the city!
I had about 12 people for 12 and although i asked for a private room
A room in the friont of the restaurant without a door is what I got
The waiter was somewhat slow, but tried to amanage all of us
The on whole was fairly good, a Grilled calamari, Strip steak, which wass just OK, and a chocolate raspberry mousse cake which was fabulous
Seem s like a neighborhood joint
The owner knew everyones name
Seems like he could of done a better job with us
I hosted a group visiting New York City and brought them here for dinner
I was impressed by VillaBerullia's ease in making space for the group (providing us with roomy tables in a semi-private area of the restaurant) and dealing with the tricky financial branch of my company
The food was also good and in ample quantities for the price
However, once we were seated, the service was a little under par
Overall, I didn't feel well-taken care of: water glasses with things floating inside (and not promptly replaced when pointed out), waitor ignored request to change order while he was still at the table, empty wine glasses ignored
no egregious errors I guess, but no special efforts either
but, a very solid place with good food and efficient service
The mixed green salad went beyond the usual with fresh chopped nuts and delicious shavings of Assiago cheese
Veal scallopini was good and the chicken Berulia was outstanding! Tira mi su, while getting played out in most places, was better than most


All in all, a good place!
Nice bar, smallish lounge and very nice ambience
Appetizers were very good, entrees were lacking flavor
The creativity of the menu deserves credit, but they just couldn't bring it together on the plate
Dessert was delectable and the service was fine
Then the bill came and WOW
I know Flat Iron continues along its rennaisance, and that NY Life is across the street and business dinners are free spending
But, c'mon
The prices did not reflect the quality of the meal
Knock off 15-20% of the prices and you have a decent night out
As it is, its way too expensive
The food and service at Mad 28 are consistently good
They have recently added a private room downstairs with its own bar for private parties of 30 or more
I just had private party there and it was fabulous
The food was delicious, the downstairs space was perfect, the prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable
I just ate here last night and was very pleased with everything! The food was scrumptious, the atmosphere inviting and the service was just rightattentive but not annoying
I would recommend this place in a heartbeat!
Good food, cheap
what else do you want
Very homey and cozy
We went on a Thursday evening around 7pm and we were the only people in the restaurant
The Service was very good
They even brought a complementary appetizer
The food was fantastic as well
There were 4 in my party and we all had different entrees and all were very tasty
We also split a tiramisu dessert and it was sooo good
I would definitely go again next time I am in NYC!
Went on there on a Saturday night in a party of 4
We showed up at 9 and we were the only people in the entire place! Kind of strange, but the food was awesome, great service, and nice atmospher
A little pricey though
Drinks and Dinner for 4 came out to $200 with tip
I thought the decor and ambiance was very fun; they were showing a silent movie on projection screens which I thought was a great concept
But unfortunately, both the service and food were very poor
The waitstaff was nice but they were also confused and unorganized
Initially there was concern at my table as to whether or not anyone was going to come to take our order
I had a salad whose ingredients were definitely past their prime and ended up making me ill
Lastly, to compound my dissatisfaction, the waiter loudly announced that he was unable to use my credit card for payment when the problem was actually that he brought us another table's check
For an overall enjoyable New York dining experience, I would have to recommend dining elsewhere
Cinema is like a TGIF's only way better
Better waitstaff, better decor, better music, and most importantly, BETTER FOOD
Went on a friday night and it was generally packed with feel good music blaring to keep the mood going
Food is surprisingly good despite the seemingly standard fare menu
Great food to try: Crab sandwich, catfish, crawfish poppers (appetizer)
You won't be disappointed
Normally I am the type of guy to scope out a restaurant before I go to it but sometimes you just don't have the time to
Luckily I was walking down the street looking for a place to eat and stumbled into Toledo
Truly authentic Spanish food (Spanish, not mexican) served in a quaint, old fashioned Spanish setting with great white wines and helpful service
My only complaint was that the prices were a bit high given the amount of food received (6 shrimp for $28?) but everything was excellently prepared
Toledo is one of the finest dining experiences I have had as of yet
The food is amazing, the waiters are extremely helpful and friendly
The ambiance is perfect!
The place was fabulous, the food was fantastic, and the waiters were very friendly
And as for the other users who commented on the price, all they had to do was get up and leave
No one forced them to stay
I will definitely be returning soon!!!
In Short Artfully selected stone benches and curry-colored pillows line the walls of the narrow, people-packed room
The crowd features a mix of vegetarians, observant Jews and Indian food fans, arriving for the vegetarian Southern Indian menu that's also, interestingly, kosher
Potato-filled dosa crepes are a popular start, though the thalis (the multi-dish sampler platters) are the best way to taste the menu's highlights
Don't waste your time
This place has the worst service I have ever experienced in my life
My boyfriend and I were really excited to find this place, we are both vegitarian, and we thought it would be a great, oh we were so wrong
After being seated we sat and waited for over 10 min for a menu
We both orderd drinks that we never recived, but were charged for, and when we said something to the waiter he rolled his eyes and asked if we wanted them anyway (after we were done eating and more than ready to go
) They didn't refill our water glasses or bother to come over and check to see if we needed anything
The food was ok, but I've had much better for a lot less money and a lot less attitude
Never again!
We went to this restaurant because of the kosher vegetarian food
The food wasn't bad (the Dosai was the best thing we ordered) but it was nothing special
There are dozens of restaurants on this street with better selections
The service made this a place my friends and I will NEVER return to
They are not helpful or attentive and at times downright rude
The waiters could care less about serving you since they automatically add a 15% tip to your bill- why be nice, they're guaranteed their money! I highly recommend going elsewhere
The waiters actually roll their eyes when you order something, as if you are imposing on them by ordering food
They don't refill your glass, or ask if you need anything else, because they don't care
There will be 5 waiters standing around doing nothing and it is nearly impossible to get their attention if you want anything, and the amount of attitude is incredible
I used to think the great food compensated for the terrible service, but it used to just be inattentive, and now has become hostile, which makes it very difficult to enjoy the meal
madras mahal two storefronts south is just as tasty without the attitude
This place is always packed, but I won't be going back
The people that own and manage this restaurant must be clueless! They are surrounded by 25 other inidan restaurants serving delectable food, yet have the gaul to mistreat their customers

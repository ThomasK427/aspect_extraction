everyone cleaned off their plates
we liked the variety of fishes
the halibut cheeks and codfish tongue were excellent as appetizers
(don't be scared - it's not what you think) we received good service
they didn't charge us extra for bringing in a birthday cake
the decor/ambience was soothing (but that one mural has got to go) be prepared to have the address on hand when locating this place or you'll miss it
What a wonderful restaurant
Our entire meal was perfect, a super wine list, with many affordable bottles
Try the New Zealand white
Fantastic dry wine
We had the blue fin appetizer, and the gazpacho - flawless
And then the salmon and lobster, both superb
They have good size portions too
And dessert was a sublime finish
Make reservations ahead, and don't miss this place!
We happened upon Fresh by accident and walked in and got the last table they had at 9pm
They had a very large selection on the menu and the wine was great
The waiter gave some excellent suggestions for appetizers and we were glad we listened
All in all a nice night
The place is very open and has interesting interior
Would not recommend for romance, but definitely for business or friends gathering
The food at FRESH was truly excellent!!! You know something is right when everyody at the table made a hmmm sound when they took their first bite of food
Definitely order the fish stew for an apetizer
it was soooo flavorful!!! Although the Tuna entree was delicious, the two people at my table mentioned that they were disappointed in the portion size
I would say my only complaint was the wait we we experienced
we had to wait 30 min for our table
we had a reservation yet we weren't seated at the slightly larger empty table
Not only did they make us wait they didn't even try to make amends
In nicer restaurants, the mgr would atleast buy a round of drinks or send over a couple of deserts
they did NOTHING
So I highly recommend the food, but I think mgmt needs a little fine tuning
I loved Fresh! I thought the food was fantastic, from salad to fish to dessert, the wine selection was lovely, the service (while a tad confused - the place is pretty new) was helpful and attentive, and the atmosphere was calm and soothing
I would recommend it highly and can't wait to go back again soon! My only hesitation is to tell too many people about it
it was half empty when I was there, and I really enjoyed the quiet
Do not waste your time
This restaurant serves bland food
The service is good and the place looks fresh but the food is certainly not
Whoever prepares the dishes should go back to culinary school and learn how to present a dish!!
Recommend Fresh without hesitation to all foodies in town
Inventive menu, fish you'll not find elsewhere, all caught fresh that morning
The owner has been provisioning the best restaurants in NY (Chanterelle, Bouloud, Ducasse
) with fish for years - he has his own stall at the Fish Market
And now he's serving the day's catch himself, and pulls it off splendidly
The fried clams were heavenly
The rillette appetizer was smoky and smooth
My friend had the fish soup, and I the swordfish - also perfectly done
Portions for both courses were extremely generous
And the service? Even the bus boys smiled! The woman who waited on our table was unhurried, knowledgeable, and spent the time to explain the unusual menu offerings, like sea urchin
Also, they've done something to control the noise level in the open, clean space
it's quite quiet, even when crowded
The Kobe Tuna was excellent
There were 6 of us and we all had wonderful dishes
Definitely worth going back!
I've been hearing a buzz about this place for some months and decided to check it out early this week
Despite the reviews i've read the service was impeccable
More than simple knowledge, this young looking staff delivers unobtrusive yet warm education to the lay
Chef Burge's menu sparkles with gems like Whole Roasted Flounder served with a ginger broth that exacts the nuttiness of this fine fish
Overly clued up music selections in a pulsingly beautifull decor are icing on the proverbial cake
Check it out soon before it's imposible to get into this one
After almost missing the front entrance on an otherwise quiet street, I walked into Fresh with somewhat high expectations
At first glance, it appeared to be another mature dining experience, but the loud, busy atmosphere was youthful and laid-back
The food, more importantly, was excellent
I had an appetizor consisting of halibut cheeks (halibut have cheeks?), a huge chunk of foi gras, spinach and a roasted peach
Right then I knew that this place means business
The service was friendly and even somewhat knowledgable
I'd definately go back

The Scene The steps leading up to BB Sandwich Bar, like the steps leading to a temple, signify that you are entering a higher realm, one you must climb to deserve
Inside, there is no menu; there is no board displaying prices
There's just a few unadorned tables, walls hung with reviews and a line of people waiting to step up to the counter
The Food Make no mistake, this is not a Philly cheesesteak
It's better
Gary Thompson, formerly the owner and chef of Sonia Rose, has created an impressive, singular sandwich
The foundation of this carefully constructed specialty is a Kaiser roll; thin slices of beef come next, topped with caramelized onions, a spicy, ketchup-based sauce and white American cheese
The result is well balanced and incredibly flavorful
Your only decisions at BB are how many cheesesteaks you want and where you want to eat them
Don't even think about substitutions
I'm from Philly, but I don't really mind that it's not authentic or since NYC food is all about fusion anyway
If you're going to do some creative poppy seed bun version of the classic cheesesteak, be my guest
My beef here, no pun intended, is that the cheese and the steak part are so grossly neglected! I mostly got a mouthful of onions and hotsauce, and hardly tasted the cheese and steak part
And that is a cardinal sin, because that's basically what a cheesesteak is
Some of the best in Philly don't even need onions to be great, it's all about the bun, the meat, the cheese, and the way they all melt together and drip out the bun and give you a nice warm fuzzy feeling
This is a good value, but go to South Philly, find Cosmi's Deli, order a cheesesteak WIDOUT and get schooled
I naievely expected a traditional cheesesteak sandwich, but got one that was smothered in one of the few underknown of Heinz's 57 varieties of tomato variants that is only available in institutional sized cans
It was tangy and sweet, and left a bad aftertaste
The upside is the sandwich was really cheap
If you order your cheesesteak and they have one pre-made, don't get it
It's likely to be crusty and a bit lukewarm
When fresh, it's heavenly bliss on a bun
melting cheese, spicy ketchup spilling down your chin
mmmmmmm
It's even better after you've had a few martinis at the Fat Black Pussycat next door
Intrigued by the idea of a sandwich shop with only one item, I opened the door
I was somewhat hoping for a Philly Cheesesteak, but this version was ok

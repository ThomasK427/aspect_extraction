The uni were fresh
The cuts of the sushi/sashimi were big
But instead of getting the standard 2-piece nigiri sushi, you only get 1 piece here
The california roll was too big and overfilled with imitation crab meat, so it's not the best I had
However, the oshinko roll here is delicious since shiso leaf and wasabi are added for that extra subtle taste
Great big pieces of sushi - so big it seems like they gave you the whole freakin' fish! Fresh though sometime the tuna has seen better days - dark and dry, and forget the toro - it is minced into a blob of fish
Not nice
Also forget ordering the red wine - they chill it rahter than serving at room temp and it is tart
Avoid this and you will have a great meal!
i've had lots of sushi and many great restaurants all across the country so i had high expectations after hearing the reviews and waiting in line for over an hour
the verdict: this place sucks
the fish is NOT fresh, doesn't blend well with the rice, everything is overpriced, especially given the bad quality of the food and the terrible atmosphere/ambience, and the service SUCKS - the waitress flat-out denied my request for a tea refill
don't waste your time with this place - go to sushi of gari instead
One of my top 3 favorites year after year after year
What can I say? Just so damn good
BUT, this is my advice- TAKE OUT! Why not? No line, no wierdos sitting in your lap (kinda crowded in there) and 10% tip at the desk rather than 20% at the table
They put all your stuff in a nice box and you can enjoy it in the comfort and sanctity of your own home
I recommend the spicy tuna hand rolls- divine; the ika kimchi, the california roll- fantastic
Impossible to go wrong here
If you are from out of town and visiting in the summer, just make sure you dont show up during their week long vacation
Please dont come to Tomoe, because then other people will know about my fabulous secret! This is the best sushi place I have ever been to
The sushi is much better than the sushi at Nobu, Blue Ribbon, and all the other highly rated restaurants
Yes, Tomoe is not a pretty place
Yes, you will wait about an hour to get a table
And yes, they only take cash
But the sushi here is incomparable! You will dance with joy the second the food touches your tongue! Ahh, just thinking about it makes me plan to go there again tonight
There's two types of sushi
fresh sushi and inventive sushi
For inventive, I wholeheartedly recommend Bond Street
But for fresh sushi, nothing tops Tomoe
The line sucks but just suck it up with a good friend
Inside, the bare bones decor is forgotten when the hunks of fish come out
Service is incredibly fast, the sashimi deluxe is filled with buttery tuna, shrimp, squid
everything is just deliciously fresh and perfect
Surprisingly a laid back place, Tomoe is fantastic
This is one spot my group couldn't get in as it was so so crowded, so we came back another day early - fit 6 of us
But we were disappointed - 'monster sushi' didn't appeal to us quality was not consistent from the tuna to the salmon to the yellowtail - spicy scallop roll just OK
Glad we didn't wait on line
Funny tho to hear others talking where they have been we heard Blue Ribbon Sushi (recommend but pricey long waits also), Raku (recommend in theater district) Sushi of Gari (UES but crowded $$$$)
this would deserve a 10 if you can forgive the long long wait (45min way too long unless you're on a nice date or with friends), cramp seating, lack of ambiance so so service, then you can enjoy the best sushi downtown (yama is passe inconsistent)
the other place I favor is raku at 47th st
/bwy
sushi is so fresh comparable
SUM IT: This is my regular spot when I'm in the village, so do try to get there early if you hate waiting like I do
used to be one of my favorites
tomoe is now california-style over-sized sushi hacked with no skill and not nearly as fresh-tasting as in the past
you've got better things to do than wait in a 2 hour line to pay $50 a head for sushi that rates only average
I was a bit intimidated by the price of the sushi rolls as I looked around the dining room and noticed how small the rolls looked
but looks are deceiving
They really know how to serve it up
I would recommend this place to those looking for fresh and inventive plate of sushi
Here's a big tip for this small place: Go 10 minutes before 5pm when they open
No Wait!  What can you say? Decent price, top grade fresh fish, casual atmosphere, and a very impressive selection of sake
I liked it better than Yama and Blue Ribbon
Tomoe has great sushi one of the best places in the city but the wait sucks
For those of you that love the sushi but cant take the lines try Hamachi
Not so hyped but the sushi there is just as good if not better
Teetering above SOHO this strictly sushi house is a cut above the deep sea of Japanese Cuisine in New York City
Here's how it rates, and when visiting, order the famous Soft shell crab dish!  1
Blue Ribbon Sushi (SOHO)  2
Sugiyama (Clinton)  3
Sachi (Museum Mile)  4
Tomoe (Village)  5
Next Door Nobu (TriBecA)  Of course there are many other great Japanese restaurants in town, but these are the undisputed best
The long, outdoor wait to get in, the crammed seating
are worth putting up with at least once
The fish is very very fresh, and the pieces are huge
I do not find their fish to be the finest in the city, but that owes more to selection than freshness, as far as i can tell
The experience here is entirely different than at Yasuda, maybe like having a huge grilled burger versus a perfect filet mignon
The prices aren't super-low, but if you consider the portion size, the value is good
Tomoe makes for an excellent introduction to great sushi
very fresh fish, very well done sushi
one of the best sushi places in the city
there is a long line to get in there but it's toally worth the wait
make sure you try the grilled hamachi collar / jaw, it's amazing
the sashimi and sushi is really, really fresh
the maki rolls are very good, too
Been visiting this spot for years now
Once a secret that has gotten out, it remains un-jaded to the increased popularity
NYC to the core
big portions, real fresh, and no pretense (read, no ambiance, densely packed tables
moOOoo)
But even w/the lines to get in, still top place in my book to get wickedly good sushi
it's sublime and cheap
Get there early to avoid the lines
We went to Tomoe finally after over-coming our fear of waiting on line for an hour
We got their at 4:50p
m
on a Saturday and we missed getting into the restaurant for the first round by 4 people
so yes, we did wait for 45 minutes, but the wait was well worth it
The Sushi was delicious and fresh tasting and the pieces were quite large
If you can stand the wait, it's worth it!
You'll always wait in line, but if you want the best fish in the city, its worth the wait
We've never been disappointed
Their yellowtail is sublime
Cost is reasonable for the quality of the food
I was so disappointed in this restaurant because I had heard amazing raves! The portions are tiny
The wait outside is horrendous
The tables are 3 inches apart from one another
The food is absolutely nothing to even talk about much less rave about

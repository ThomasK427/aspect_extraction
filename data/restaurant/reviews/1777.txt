Delicious, spicy pan-Asian food
Portions are a little small for what you pay, and they could use some lunch specials
Back patio is nice, if a little dirty
In Short This Chelsea location attracts a lively dinner crowd with its casual, festive decor and broad menu of Mexican favorites, ranging from standard burritos and enchiladas to more specialized fare
To follow the freshly made margaritas and authentic guacamole, popular entree choices include the Enchiladas Supreme with chicken, the pollo yucatan and the steak picado fundido
An extensive list of vegetarian options is also offered
Just tried this place a few weekends ago
The hostess was not existent although there were clearly a group of about 10 employees in the back chatting with each other, not paying attention to customers
After about 10 minutes, we were seated - in the back - though there were plenty of window seats in the front available
After sitting there for about 15 minutes and trying to get eye contact with the many employees doing absolutely NOTHING in the back, we still were ignored
We finally left and now I'm writing this awful review because, essentially, they have no business operating a restaurant
This place truly sucked!
We went on Wednesday night the place was busy
The food was okay nothing to write home about but they were stingy on the serving
If I am paying $13 for an entree I want to see the chunkys of chicken
MOST DISAPPOINTING WAS THE SERVICE
THE WAITERESS WAS PLAIN RUDE
My friends was kind enough to leave her $6 I would have left her $0 and wrote her a rude comment! Never will I go back and would recommend anyone to a fastfood joint
If you want Montezuma's revenge, then eat here
It is a cash only restaurant
No credit cards
Mushrooms on everything, even when not specifically listed on the menu
Terrible food
Will never go back
I work nearby and have eaten here a cuple of time
Decent food, good service, reasonable prices
Worth eathing at if you want Mexican food, not really worth going out of your way for it though
Home made style Meican food, the best margaritas and cheap prices, make the best of Maryann's
Hungry for Mexican food, we sat down and ordered
The guacamole app
that we ordered never came, and after we told three different people, it still didn't come, but showed up on the bill
The food was sub-par, and they got our special orders wrong
The service was terrible, enver once refreshing our drinks and never once asking if we wanted anything else
Plus the flan tasted like it came from someone's shoe
I used to recommend this restaurant to those looking for a comfortable place to chow on some Mexican food
Unfortunately, the food and service seem to get worse with each visit
Like any New Yorker, I enjoy dining late, and slipped into Mary Ann's sometime around 10pm on a Saturday night
The waiter was blatantly rude and accidentally brought us pure hobanero sauce instead of spicy salsa
Each entree was brought out at a different time, and did not have the same side dishes that were listed on the menu
I still suggest trying this place out, but don't go with high expectations and certainly don't go after 8pm
Was there on a saturday night for dinner, not only did we have to wait 1/2 hour to be seated, but the place was so cramped and so unbelievably loud that we were all screaming at each other
Food was decent and service was pretty quick considering the crowds, but not a particularly pleasurable eating experience
the best mexican Restaurant in NYC, I Love the services, food and margaritas
Is a places were you could be yourself Hi to JENNY, Eric, Richie and Humberto the best staff
Mary Ann's is a fave of ours for brunch and I love how you can almost always get a seat
Lots of vegie choices on the menu and a comfy atmosphere
Mary Ann's is one of my favorite resturants ever
I bring everyone I know here, and they always leave with firm plans to return
The food is fantastic, filling, and underpriced, and with such an extensive menu there is something for every taste
A picky-about-Mexican friend from Arizona admitted recently that it is easily comparable in quality to any place he's ever been
The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed
in short, if you haven't tried Mary Ann's yet, you are missing out on one of the best staple restaurants in New York
I have had the pleasure of visiting a couple of Mary Ann's Mexican Restaurants and have been impressed with the food, the quality of service and the atmosphere
Everytime I plan to be in New York City, I make it a point to visit one of Mary Ann's Mexican Restaurants
I especially like the guacamole - it is out of this world!!!!
This place is second rate, college kid Tex-Mex at best
Most dishes are smothered in melted cheese or merely mediocre; flan is flat and pedestrian, drenched in tasteless sugar syrup; and even its supposedly best feature - the margarita - is a hit-or-miss affair
Some nights they were just awful
Once they even called it melon when it had AT MOST a shot of midori
I wouldn't even step foot in there if it weren't b/c that was the most convenient place to go that fit in everyone's price range for my group after our evening volunteer shift (always under my protestation, of course)
Now I gently steer them away by offering alternate options in the neighborhood
Maryann's is the American bastardization of Mexican food at its worst form!
The food here is cheap and pretty good, but the margaritas are the real treat
Also, it's nice because they make everything in-house
The food here's pretty solid fare -- no big surprises, but tasty enough Mexican and Mexican-like standards
The space can get insane, though -- too many tables, too crowded together -- so it's a better option for lunch or offpeak hours than the crazed crush from cocktail time on
Unless, of course, you like that kind of thing
A welcome dining experience!!  Excellent food, attentive staff, a very complimentary wine list, and comfortable atmosphere lead all the way to a successful time for your pallet!
While staying in Chelsea, I wandered over to Tazza two nights for dinner
The bar is beautiful, and the servers and bartender (Mike?) were so friendly
The food was perfectly divine, and the atmosphere is so relaxed, yet fun
I'm an out-of-towner who doesn't know anyone in NYC, and the bartender offered some suggestions about things to see, places to go, etc
It was a much better experience than I had at another upscale, extremely snooty Chelsea restaurant
I will absolutely go back next time I am in the neighborhood
A fancy restaurant without the fancy attitude
Dim, candlelit dining room is accented by a funky star pointed bar and multi-colored ceiling lamps, with trendy upbeat music in the background
Pretty boy waiters provide nice eye candy
We walked in at 8 p
m
on a Saturday and were seated right away
The filet mignon is ex-quisite
Try their apple martinis too
This is definitely the best value in upscale dining in Chelsea
My good 'ol standby in the neighborhood
Great food at reasonable prices
Somehow I always get lucky and can get in without reservations when everywhere else is booked solid
Dinner for 2 with appetizers, entree, dessert and even a coktail
less than $80
There's also a pre-fixe menu if you can make it in by 7 which I never can seem to do
One of my favorite appetizers is the layered mozzerella proscuitto wrapped in romaine and seared, served with ripe tomatoes and drizzled with balsamic
absolutely delicious
Simple foods but not simple in taste
Best Mediterranean fare in the area
The small, neighborhood friendly joint seems to be a great dating spot with great food and decent service
I'm not sure why the Citysearch price lists it as $$$ because its more like $
I was impressed with the quality of the food and the lovely music playing in the background as our waiter catered to our table
The one gripe I had at the end of the night was the 20% suggested gratuity, I've never had anything like that before
Its strange, but true and sadly already tacked onto the bill
It was a good time, but not an ideal one and can really spoil the mood after such a fine meal
Finally, a cozy, comfortable neighborhood place with suprisingly delicious cuisine in Chelsea!  I had the pasta special, linguine with shrimp

Both brunch and dinner entrees are well-prepared and delicious, and dessert (if you have room) is scrumptious
Definitely a boon to the neighborhood
A friend took me to Taboon for my birthday and it was fabulous
I had more than my fair share of what I now know is their infamous flatbread, because it was so incredibly delicious -- carbs be damned! I loved the zuccini cakes but best of all was the hanger steak special, accompanied by chick pea spaetzle
A truly unique menu and experience
I'll definitely be going back
Visited this wonderful restaurant recently and had a marvelous evening - the food was delicious and ambience just the best, very reasonable too! Will definately be back for more!!
This restaurant is a gem, we visited NYC for a holiday recently and Taboon has left a lasting impression
Excellent waiting service and gorgeous food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more! It really is worth a visit
Full marks
I am shocked at all the rave reviews
the bread was about the best thing at Taboon which is a shame because they had a real shot at doing something different
there is no ambience, the appetizers were better than the main course which really isnt saying much
the ceviche had way too much lemon in it, the zucchini cakes had no taste and one had to hunt for the fillings in the caeser salad in the lettuce
the lamb kebabs were dry
we were so disappointed that we skipped on dessert
the waitress had to ask us if we wanted our food doggy-bagged since we could not finish the dry kebabs
overall a pass, you will find much better value for money in the city
Hell's Kitchen wouldn't be the first place I would think of to find an excellent restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised with Taboon
The atmosphere was suitably busy but not too busy, it felt happening without making me feel uncool and the food was exquisite
I was there for dinner, and it was amazing -- the food was so well prepared and the my waiter was so helpful when I couldn't decide what to order (the oxtail stew was delicious!)
But you have to pace yourself
You'll be tempted to fill up on the bread and dinner, but dessert is not to be missed
The petit fours are presented beautifully, and they're little bites of heaven
I also spotted Jacques Torres and Cindy Adams, so it's a fun place to people watch
That the food was generally decent is irrelevant, as we essentially had to beg to be served and even then everything came with a heavy dose of bad attitude
Our waitress scoffed as we asked for water, failed to bring us menus after multiple requests, and never took our drink orders (perhaps she's a teetotaler? that would explain her sneer when we meekly asked for glasses of wine)
Maybe my expectations are too high, but if I'm paying north of $25 for a fish that comes whole, I don't want to be tossed an extra plate and given a curt The chef said he won't do it as a response to a request that it be filleted
The list goes on
Horrible service, slow and amateur
I would not go again - the meal took 3 hours! We could not make our movie on time
Food only OK, not oh my god to die for
All in all, I will not go there again
The Scene Mismatched plastic tablecloths, bright, colorful murals depicting grazing deer and Lowcountry scenery, and a ceiling of lattice fencing dripping with moss set the stage for rowdy indulgence
Casually dressed couples and families with kids are equally at home
The Food This is rich, stick-to-your-ribs (and thighs) Cajun-Creole cooking
The most popular dish on the menu is an appetizer of unabashedly indulgent, savory cheesecake filled with chunks of alligator sausage and shrimp
Look for anything that comes topped with the addictive, creamy house gravy, such as the fried eggplant appetizer
The thick, crispy crusted fried chicken is your best entree bet
Some dishes lack oomph: The too-mild and lukewarm shrimp etouffee and tough, dry stuffed pork chops disappoint
But don't miss the bright, tart Key lime pie for dessert
I heard that this place had great food/music, so decided to take my family visiting for the weekend
Unfortunatley, the food was horrible and service sub-par
I ordered a hamburger, and got a brick between two pieces of bread
Even more shocking was the shard-shaped eggshell included in the eggs benedict
There are much better places than this and probably more reasonably priced
Food quality may be subjective, and perhaps depends who is in the kitchen, which might explain the mixed nature of the reviews I've read -- but -- when as the host of a party of 7, I asked if I could get change for the parking meter and was told to go to the delicatessen down the block, I couldn't help but feel that the service might have been more considerate
Some people speak well of the food, while others don't
This may indicate a strong difference in tastes among customers, or a lack of uniformity in preparation
My own feeling was that the things I tasted were bland -- which is not to be expected in this type of cusine
The two things that were uniformly rated favorably were the Bloody Marys and the Louisiana coffee
Had a part of five and had awonderful time and dinner
in fact, too much food but that is the Nawlins way
one of our guests was from N
O
and he said it was the real deal! Our only concern is the automatic tipping scheme
if you have a large party, considered 5 or more apparently, they automatically add a 20% gratuity
Now we are not a group that doesn't like to tip well, but automatically adding the tip at that range is assuming a lot
As it turned out, our waiter deserved it
just didn't like the assumption
Altogether
a great experience
Great place - relaxed atmosphere, killer bloody marys, and delicious food
Service is always good
Go for brunch - it's sure to please for those who like their eggs spicy!
After trying a few times (unsuccessfully) to get a table, we finally broke through - and we understand why it's always crowded
Started with a truly outstanding Bloody Mary -- delicious
We had the fried chicken (very good, but probably not NYC's best) and the Mahi Mahi (also good)
Desserts were not only really good, but neither we tried were boring, classic versions -- we had the Coconut Creme Pie (yummmm) and the Key Lime Pie
Finally, the room is festive with hanging, colorful lights and something of a mellow party atmosphere, and the service is very friendly
We'll be back
The best Bloody Mary in Manhattan! Service was great, the waitress was like our new best friend
Food was fantastic and the setting made you forget you were in NYC for a few hours
Really enjoyed the food, especially the alligator cheesecake and the oysters beinville
This is not fine french cuisine, nor is it meant to be
Instead this is what a NOLA restaurant should be, storng drinks, spicy food, fun atmosphere
Bartenders and servers all very pleasant and helpful
I will definatley be going back!
The service was so bad it inspired me to sign up on this website
Ive been to Jacques-Imo in New Orleans, the wait is long (3+ hours) but the food and service more than makes up for it
My experience at J-I in NYC was anything but that
30 minutes to take our order even longer to receive drinks which they brought twice, the appetizers were cold, they forgot to bring salad and bread which they brought after our main meal
Our second order of drinks came in 45 minutes after we reminded them
The Mahi Mahi was bland
If your entrees are priced $20-$25 your wait staff should have it together
I don't remember the last time I had such poor service - this was a real disappointment - and the place wasn't full or busy? No one in our party will be returning to this restaurant
Jacques-Imo's Rules
Their cajun food is fantastic! The atmosphere is a lot of fun, and the staff are are friendly and helpful
I can't wait to eat at their New Orleans location
We've been here a few times, and each time was better than the last
Having moved here from Louisiana, I have been on the search for good Cajun/Creole food
I visited the New Orleans restaurant and met the owner
I was pleased to hear that he had opened a restaurant in NYC
We promply dined at the NYC location as soon as we returned from our trip, and we had one of the best meals ever
The alligator/shrimp cheesecake was a hit! We took our native NYC friends, and we tried many of the unusal dishes
We were stuffed, but we still made room for the delicious, unique desserts!
I had brunch here and all the food we had was quite tasty
However, $15 for a poached egg with 5 fried oysters and $9 for a bloody mary seem pretty steep
The place has a kitschy feel which may appeal to some, but not to others
Brunch for 3 ppl with drinks (one person didn't order any food) still came out to ~$60

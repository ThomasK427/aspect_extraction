For dessert, the tres leches is great
Rosa mexicana had some pretty good margaritas and some unqiue and tastey mexican food
The appetizers were a little small but very good and recommended as were the main dishes
All of them come with the opt to make them spicer
don't use too much or you'll be paying for it later!   Decor is nice and the service was on point
I found it a little odd that the male bathroom was all the way in the basement
Oh well
I have been to rosa mexicano numerous times and every time was a sheer delight! The food, service, ambience is impecable
I go as often as i can, it's a bit pricey but definitely worth it!! All you need is acceptional company to complete the experience
Rosa on 1st is one of my all time favorites
I have never been disappointed with a meal
The service is good and the wait staff are friendly
True that this place is a bit pricey but the food and drink are worth it
The guacamole served with warm freshly made tortillia and chips is fantastic
The sangria is robust and flavorful, but you must have a pomegranate margarita
YUM! My all time favorite dishes are the grilled shrimp with rice, pan seared chillian sea bass and the filet mignon with mushrooms
We just had a dinner party last night and everyone was happy with thier meal
I can't wait to go again! PS
Make sure you make a reservation!
A young upper east side neighborhood crowd the night that I went here with friends
Pricey but very interesting Mexican food that is not the average fare
The drinks are good but expensive and the dishes are just as pricey
Guacamole is made at your table and is quite entertaining
I would suggest coming to this place if you want to experience Mexican haut cuisine or impress a date
Reservations are highly suggested
Filet Migon with wild mushrooms in a tequila cream sauce=to die for! The filet is butterflied and covered in this amazing tequila cream sauce
I left very satisfied with my order
For aptz me and my girlfriends ordered the guac
which they make right in front of you and we almost liked the bowl clean
I highly recommend this resturant if you are looking for a great Mexican spot!!
Delicious Mexican food and drink! The guacamole for 2 is fresh and delicious, made to taste
The pomegranate margarita is the best margarita I've had in NYC in years - it's something very special
Thereafter, the food only got better, we had the grilled filet mignon and the beef tenderloin entrees, and a delicious fresh mango/coconut ice cream dessert
Absolutely delicious, and for a 2-person meal, getting out of there for not much more than $100 made for a very pleasant experience
Make sure that you make reservations
Three friends and I went here last night for Restaurant Week and were sorely disappointed in our choice
The prix fixe Restaurant Week menu was not very interesting or appealing
The appetizer of oysters that I had were disgustingly salty and my salmon entree was incredibly dry
The margaritas were nothing special and were $10, though that's not too outrageous in this city
What was most upsetting was that they charged us TWENTY-EIGHT DOLLARS for guacamole for the table
It was good, but not worth $28
While the waiters were friendly, service was rather slow
Overall, I found Rosa Mexicano to be far below average and will never recommend it or return
The food wasn't great for the price we paid
It is extremely overrated
Nothing impressive
Extremely crowded
I would much rather go eat Good Fine Mexican Cuisine at Maya, Mexicana Mama or Dos Caminos
I expected much more from Rosa Mexicano
Don't waste your time and money here
We've been to this place a few times in the last couple of years and never been impressed
A couple we hang with likes it a lot but, we don't see it as anything but an overcrowded, overpriced, average Mexican food joint
The Margaritas are no different than anywhere else (smaller, though!), the guacamole (their specialty) is flavorless, and the food is only a cut above the regular Tex-Mex stuff you can get in dozens of places in the city
Maya has much better food and puts a different spin (i
e
, creative) on theirs and gets much better flavors to boot
Maz Mexcal has more variety and better Margaritas
We know Rosa Mexicano gets all the press but, like I said, We don't get it
After reading previous reviews of this restaurant I was excited to try it out with a group of friends
Unfortunately, it was some of the worst food I have ever had and the service was abyssmal as well
The guacamole is tasty and some of the entrees were creative, but the praise really must stop there
The actual taste of many of the dishes (I went with a large party and tried a bunch) was bland and disappointing
The musicians are a nice idea, but really make it impossible to talk to anyone in your party and impossible for the waiters to move around the restaurant (twice members of my party were bonked with trays by waiters)! It was painful to pay the steep tab for such a mediocre experience
The food at Rosa Mexicano is extremely overrated, I have never understood why it continually gets the ranking it does
What is wonderful is the guacamole, when combined with a couple of margaritas at the bar it is perfect
And the bartenders at the 60th Street location are great, the atmosphere too
But forget about the food, especially for the money
It is the most tasteless mexican I have ever had
I thought this restaraunt was great
Loved the guacamole, sangria and the mole
My friend and I were very satisfied with the whole experience
Definitely recomended!
Why is this place rated so high?? Everyone goes here, but why? The food is served cold and is not that great
Don't go close to closing or your dining expierience will be very very short
Ask for margaritas the way you want them, the house margs are nothng to to cheer about
We had to wait 20 minutes- I made a res 6weeks in advance
We were seated next to a door that had such a horrible draft, everyone around us were wearing HATS and SCARVES thru-out their meals
When I politely asked to move, the waiter was rude and he tried to sit us at the table right next to us- which was equally unacceptable!! Normally, I'd have left but seeing as it was a special occasion we stayed
But things only got worse- the water was never replenished, the food took forever and was COLD
I realize sometimes things go wrong, but it made things worse that the Maitre D or waiter never apologized or tried to compensate for our disappointment
To be fair, the food was excellent- when we received it but service and price aren't worth it
My advice is if you want quality Mexican food, get take-out
I cannot see why anyone in NYC would pay the over-the-top prices for this place, but it still packs them in
After waiting more than an hour for a table (forget about visiting on a Saturday night), we sat down only to be conned into paying for the expensive chips and dip at the table
Once we sat down after standing and waiting for our table for more than an hour, the waiter asked us if we wanted something to drink, but then he only said guacomole? We thought it was as natural as giving us salsa to munch on since there were no chips on the table
After opening the menu, we learned that it was $14! And it tasted terrible! Two people ended up costing $120! And we each only had two drinks
Although the service is nice, the food is boring and untasty
I will never return
Big thing to know before you go: If you love the typical American interpretation of Mexican food, you may not like the food here
If you have spent time in Mexico City and loved the local flavors, this place is a must
This is true Mexican cuisine, and as such, the flavors are subtle
Cocoa, cinnamon and other flavors many Americans do not associate with Mexican food are found in these dishes and they are done wonderfully
I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce
If you haven't had mole sauce before, ask the server to bring some to the table for you to taste first
The staff is amazing and the experience is worth the price tag
Be adventurous! Try it!
Unfortunately, I don't think I could describe in words how disappointed we were with this restaurant
We went there in a group of 6 and even with all of the great ratings this place gets, we found the food to be below average
No one was happy with their meal
Even though the food was prepared nicely, it was definitely lacking flavor

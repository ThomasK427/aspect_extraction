But the prices are really reasonable, they're always available, and the food is yummy!
Food is ok
Happy hour is great, especially after work where my coworkers and I frequent
BUT service is baaaaaad, one waitress/hostess in particular!!!! Put it this way - everytime we go to try to enjoy ourselves, we always say hope the b**ch isn't going to be there
Sun
eve 1st people in for dinner
FREEZING inside Outside sign says $1 Stoli, Heineken Waitress explains we have to GO TO THE BAR TO ORDER THEM @ bar, 2 Stoli Bloody Mary's that's 6 dollars! WHAT? Yeah Stoli and Baccardi are $3, your sign says $1 Party of 3 get seated in the back (where it's warm) My friend asks if we can sit in back Waitress said NO,bartender said back is for larger parties,wouldn't want to ask us to move in mid-meal to seat a larger party  ASK US HAVE YOU MOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR MEAL? Brought the drinks to the table, worst Bloody Mary EVER, couldn't finish it
Waitress comes back to take our order, we said no and left
I don't expect pampering, BUT I expect a restaurant to accomodate their customers when it comes to the fact it's freezing and dead inside
although the food is good and the happy hour is great - the music is so loud, you won't be able to enjoy either
i left midway through my meal because - as an affront to my request to turn down the music - the management turned the music up!   although i used to go at least 3 times a week and drag all my friends from manhattan there with me - after last night I will never step foot in there again!
You absolutely cannot beat this place for a 6$ lunch combo delivered to your desk
I have ordered at night too, and the regular menu is still cheap as hell
I live in williamsburg and work in soho, I guess they opened a place here somewhere because they've been delivering to my office and in manhattan it's even faster
Yesterday I got my food in 15 minutes even though they told me 30
The prices are the same and I find them cheap in williamsburg so for the city it's increadible
The food is always consistent, try combining dishes, tomato basil salad with chix fingers in it or my boyfriends favorite, steak sandwich with jalapeno poppers
The food is priced exactly right for what I'm getting, the service for the most part is excellent they even called me once to tell me they're going to be late and they still made it on time
I live in Greenpoint and if it weren't for anytime I'd probably have to buy a car or something because there's nothing here after 12am
If they start delivering DVD's my girlfriend and I would never leave the house, besides that I can't ask for much more
The Scene Quartino's airy dining room, wrapped in high windows, hinges around a trendy bar where regulars sip wine out of blunt tumblers while swapping stories--often in Italian
Quiet couples and jovial groups enjoy leisurely meals at the candlelit farmhouse tables
Though friendly, the servers bring new meaning to the term "Slow Food
"  The Food  Quartino finds strength in the deliberate simplicity of Liguria's coastal cuisine, bolstered by seasonal vegetables and high quality ingredients
Some offerings are elemental almost to a fault: the tuna, fagiolini and potato salad escapes boredom thanks to fruity olive oil and sea salt; but a beautifully oven-roasted striped bass deserves more interesting companions than a lemon wedge, steamed spinach and potatoes
Homemade pastas and yeasty thin-crust pizzas and focaccia, however, are divine
Finish with cracker-thin, almond biscotti dipped in Vin Santo
My husband and I have been scouring the area for a decent italian restaurant and we've finally found it
The food is good and rustic, we especially enjoyed the pizza bianca with prosciutto and lightly dressed spinach
The pasta is good, although the pesto is a bit too oily
Anbience is casual and homey
We'll definitely be back
Went with my date to Quartino mid-week after work
It was a rainy night so that must have kept the crowd down, we were seated immediately
VERY fresh ingredients, you can definitely taste the difference, nice wine selection and reasonably priced
Service was a bit slow, but unobtrusive
Farmhouse decor - you might like it for a change of pace from more stylish establishments, you might not
Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant
great quaint neighborhood restaurant
service was friendly and attentive, food was excellent
great atmosphere and nice outdoor garden
highly recommend
This place was hard to find and I was surprised after all the great reviews to find I wasn't really impressed at all with the atmosphere or food
For the money spent I expected much more
The portions are perfect for those who prefer to steer clear of the super-sized food culture and the service is perfectly paced for those who enjoy to sit and sip and chat rather than rush
The food is fresh, the place is welcoming, and i can't wait return again and again
Quaint restaurant
Would definitely dine there again
Food is fresh and full of life
Felt like I was in Italy
Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened
We've always gotten amazing service and we love the food
Unfortunately, lately it has been getting harder and hard to get a table
Alas, Quartino's success is my loss!
Seldom in NYC is a meal absolutely perfect
but this one was
I brought a party of 10 to celebrate my birthday with good food in a charming setting at a reasonable cost that's exactly what we found at Quartino
Everyone was happy
Being that it is a small restaurant, I would recommend making a reservation--especially for parties larger than 4
My wife and I went to Quatino on the suggestion of CitySearch
We love the decor
Extremely comfortable and almost no clutter
There is a wonderful amount of space between the tables
The service was not bad, but a bit vague
The food was average and a bit overpriced for its quality
The quartinos of wine
Basically two shots
I think Quartino is a charming restaurant with good food
i go there every two or three months and each time leave feeling disppointed in the miniscule pasta portion
For $12
00 I think the pasta should fill me up
Instead I find myself scraping my bowl with bread trying to fill up
The food is good
just don't go too hungry
This restaurant has rustic charm and personal, warm service
The owner immediately recognized my name from the reservation I called in earlier in the day, and later stopped by our table to chat
The people who dined around us were all Italian, which was an added bonus
My companion's 'fish of the day' plate was very tasty, I would recommend trying it out
Mine wasn't as successful
The prices are hard to beat!
Skip Little Italy, and go to this place
Quartino is the real Italian restaurant, together with its rustic charm, fabulous and delicious food, and of course great hospitality
This is the ultimate chill out place
The acoustics are incredible, everyone there makes you feel like you are someone special and so welcome to be there
I've practically had everything on the menu and have never been disappointed
I can't say enough about the wine list-the Shiraz is especially delightful
The music and the ambience takes you to such a blissful place, you must check it out
Wandered by chance into the GV Bistro 4 years ago on vacation and have been going ever since
Last trip we were there 5 times in three days - great food, great service, and the owners made us feel like family, literally
On one night we heard an Irish band, saw Thai dancers, and drank absolutely lethal German beer for next to nothing
For a genuine NY/non-touristy experience, this is the best place in the Village
Tell them that you're from Pittsburgh and you'll have a friend forever
Service is a little spacey, but it's mostly harmless and the staff was tremendously nice
Food is almost good enough to merit such prices (most entrees are about 15-20ish) -- but it's not stunning
The real draw is the lovely atm
: laid back, open, accepting
It's the antithesis of stuffy, with folks sitting around for hours, people reading and writing
One woman was rolling up a ball of yarn, using two chairs
Wines and beers are pretty well chosen and fairly priced

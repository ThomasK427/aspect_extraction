The food is very affordable but the restaurant is usually very crowded
I have not had the pizza but it looks delicious
The waiter is a character
Bar none, one of the best slices of pizza you can find - unique, and scrumptious
Their gyros are super as well
Fontana makes gyros right! I've tried gyros and souvlakis there and they're great
This place is also great if you want to take out
Their service is quick and food is cheap
I have had Gyros from all over US and fonatanas is by far the best I have had
everychance I get to go to NY i make sure to go there and get some
as a matter of fact i brought some back (10) last week
They are awesome
everything is original there nothing made outside of the store
Everything is made there
I recommend this place to everyone and I have not seen one disappointed person
And you cant beat the price
Some twenty years ago a musician friend of mine bragged about this inexpensive italian restaurant he knew, built into the side of a hill, that was soooo GOOOOOD
It was called Aunt Bella's
So I went
And it was better than good
The food was GREAT!!! And like my friend said it was very reasonble
What a find
Besides the food, the ambience reminds one of being in your grannie's dining room
And the staff
Joanna, Debbie
so nice
Over the years this place has become a second home and the staff have become friends
I'll always keep going there and I tell all my friends to try it
Hey I bring my parents there and they love it too
my friends and family have been obsessed with this place since its been around
the california roll is the most amazing tasting thing ever (ask for a side of spicy mayo to dip it in)
On top of the amazing food, the service is speedy fast
you could be out of there in ten minutes if you want
This is one of the better sushi places in Queens even though it is a little small
I've been going there for about 2 years now and I have to say that their Godzilla Roll is to die for
it just melts in your mouth
mmm
delicious!
This marvelous little restaurant has it all! The food, the ambiance, the owners, the tablecloths, the bread, the French butter and the profiteroles are
and feel like you died and went to heaven! Prices are amazingly reasonable
Thank you to my friends  Marie-Lise and John who told me about it
The lunch buffet is amazing, and if you go and don't taste the bread pudding, you'll regret it forever! And yes, I only speak French when I go there
Thank you Marie-Lise!
This restaurant has been in town for more than 20 years, and is becoming less than the well kept secret we had been hoping to continue!  The owners are Algerian, and provide a unique blend of French continental and North African cuisine
In addition to the early bird menu, don't overlook the luncheons, when available
what a deal!  We have used this restaurant for celebrations for years, and are delighted to be recognized from anniversary to anniversary
The owners present a kind of charm you would want to find in all restaurants listed as providing French cuisine
Feel free to practice your French here!  Enjoy
I had food here and was very surprised
For a Little Neck restaurant the food was on the level
Great potato-leek soup! Don't talk too much to the owner, he has a bit of an attitude
Otherwise, I'd go there again just for the meal, the twilight price was very good
I love the twilight dinner menu here
21
95 for 3 course menu is the best deal you can find in city
The bread here is unforgetable
It makes you feel like dining in a country house in European country side
This little place provides excellent service
Very detailed table manner and friedly
THey offer great food at a reasonable cost
Never had a bad meal or party at TJK Cafe
This is by far the best persian restaurant in ny
A real authentic family run restaurant
Healthy, amazing food, beautiful decor, and amazing atmosphere I love this place
Also its in Little Neck not in flushing
I would say that this place is worth it for the lunch menu
Where can you get a total lunch for under $10? The Lunch comes with a meal, an appetizer, a salad and a cup of tea
The place is dark and gloomy but the lunch menu is worth the price
Parking is available
As I recall Lunch is from 12 -6
The waiters are polite and helpul
This is probably the best Iranian restaurant in New York City for the money
this is a nice place, have been a regular for 5 yrs
the lamb shank over cherry rice (special request pay extra) is excellent
cornish hens juicy cooked
didn't like yogurt drink
sambosas good, not overfried/hard, nan is great for dipping
entertaining belly dancing
SUM IT: definitely worth a try, lots of regulars, friendly svc, not fair to compare to patoug which is also good
THIS PLACE IS BY FAR THE BEST PLACE IN ALL OF NEW YORK
IF I COULD I WOULD GO THERE EVERYDAY FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER
100 TIMES BETTER THAN THE RESTAURANT CALLED PATOUGH
SERVICE IS GREAT AND THE FOOD IS TOP QUALITY
CAN'T WAIT TO GO THERE AGAIN
WORTH THE 3000 MILE TRIP
I lived in Brooklyn all my life, and after I moved to Queens I could never find good pizza
But I found it here
They deliver pretty quickly, and they have great Grandma's Pizza
It's a square w/ fresh tomato sauce and mozz
It's delicious~ They also have a variety of other toppings like you have to try the Artichoke Hearts
mmm mm mm~ They have tasty hot heroes, and delicious pasta dishes too
It's mostly like a corner pizzaria joint, but they have seating in the back when youwant to sit in and enjoy your meal
Sals is a great addition to the tradition of GREAT New York pizza and should at the top of anyones list
This coming from a born and bred New Yorker!!!!
Sal's Little Neck Pizza not only serves THE BEST cheese pizza I have ever tasted, it also has a down-home feel and friendly service to boot
As for Sal, well he's as Italian as they come-- trust him on his picks for pizza-- SAL KNOWS BEST! Do I see a franchise opportunity here?!
Sal's pizza is the best thin-crust pizza you'll find on the eastern seaboard
The ratio of cheese (part skim milk) to sauce results in a brilliant balance of taste
The crust is present, but not overpowering and is always a welcome finish to the slice
The owner, Salvatore Leo, has been feeding Little Neck for 27 years with both pizza and his theories on everything from Reaganomics to car mechanics

And the coffee was lukewarm and weak
My friend and I ate dinner at Caf Luise this past weekend after reading the below reviews
I had the $10
95 five-spice pork chop, which was a savory, large portion matched with a delicious baked apple
I was a bit disappointed with the Yukon gold 'smashed' potatoes that came with the dish they were seasoned chunks of potato, and tasty enough, but I was expecting mashed potatoes
My friend ordered the Thai chicken salad, which she thought was fine but a bit small to be an entre portion
Caf Luise is a good value, but oddly enough, the appetizers are not priced as affordably as the entrees
Nice atmosphere lots of windows overlooking a corner
Had dinner there a few nights ago and what a blast - the wait staff was so fun and the food was great oh my god the pork chops and the Salmon mmmmm - but the real kicker is when we got the check - it is so nice when you finally go out in NYC and you do not lose your arm your leg and your wallet
This may be the best deal i have had in the city - it really feels like it is supposed to be in the Lower East side unlike so many of these new places that are brining uptown prices downtown - thank you Luise and i will see you real soon
The food is really, really good
The place is cute and has really attentive service
I love it because it is BYO
And, the burger is the BOMB
You gotta try it
The place is the best value on the LOE
Everything that I wanted - Great ambience, great food and great prices
Very homey
Despite the travel (I live upper west side), My wife and I often head downtown for a bite, and Cafe Luise and their crew have NEVER disappointed
Dollar for dollar the best place in New York
Keep doin what your doin guys, cause you're doin it right
I love, love, love this place! It's soooo cute
My favorite dish is the mussels
They are to die for
You have to come here just for that dish
The owners are very sweet and accomodating
It is definitely worth checking out
Cafe Luise is a great place for informal dinner with friends for any occasion
The menu has a great variety
Each time I come I find something
The salmon with the mango salsa was absolutely delicious!! I am always satisfied with the service, ambiance, and the food!! Highly recommended!!!
There are a few small restaurants in NY that deserve praise for great food, warm service, cool people, and cafe luise is definitely one of them
The friendly staff always make me feel like i'm at home
Try the mussels, any one of their yummy salads, and their electic selection of entrees
I love this place
can't stop me from going there time and time again!!!
Innovative menu, tasty mussels, and BYOB! the location is perfect, the amount of space perfect for intimate dinner parties and the music is hot
you definitely get a sexy vibe with quick inexpensive meals
Great for people watching and cozy dates
I have been there a few times now and even though they just opened they seem to have it together
The food is really quite bold and tasty and the prices are fantastic!!! A great addition to the LES and a great date place although i would bring a group of my friends too
Keep up the good work
I think they may be in the running for best burger - morrocan style!!
cafe luise is a charming restuarant with great food
i've been there twice and the flavorful dishes and inexpensive prices will have me coming back for more!
The Scene The interior of this corner spot is handsomely decorated in bright wood
Formerly a narrow counter with a few seats, it has expanded to include a full dining room
The Food Rather than limiting the menu to one type of masterful barbecue, Daisy May's offers a sampler of several regional styles
Pork ribs come Kansas City-style, with a sweet, smoky glaze, or with a hotter Memphis-style dry rub
Choosing favorites is moot, though, amid so much super-tender meat
Coarse-chopped brisket tastes of smoke and garlic; pulled pork has a mellow, vinegary bite
The sides, like dense, chunky mashed potatoes with rich red-eye gravy, cheesy corn kernels and intensely creamy spinach, are just as excellent
Wash down a huge portion with a Mason jar of perfect sweet iced tea
If this is the place to be in Manhattan for BBQ and Southern comfort than I am disappointed
Decided to order delivery from here and got my food within 40 minutes and was let down the moment I took sunk my teeth into the chicken breast I ordered for my group and I
The jambalaya, ribs, and cornbread were dry, almost stale
The one good thing that I would consider ordering again is the cheese laced corn, which may spawn an instant heart attack from the calories, but what a good way to go out it would be! Food was a bit on the spendier side, which only helped me realize that this was not worth the trouble
I've eaten LOTS of BBQ in the South and I vehemently contest the fact that Daisy May's BBQ got a 9
8!!! The pork is barely pulled, thus resulting in big chunks
The meat is not very lean compared to what I'm used to---I can taste and feel the oily residue that's left after cooking, not to mention, it soaks through the bun quickly
Finally, the flavor is bland because it is only sweet and not at all tangy like the mustard-based and vinegar-based BBQs that are so prevalent and popular in the South
I'd rate it around----oh, let's say----5
5, maybe a 5
7 if they bun's not stale!
The best ribs, best beans, best yams, best corn bread, best sweet tea this side of the Virgina state line
If only they had better seating, DM's would be a BBQers paradise
But in warm weather, its great to get fixins to go and have a picnic in Bryant Park
Very simple _ both my review and Daisy May's
The restaurant is a lean-to, but if it's warm outside there are benches with a place to set your food
Go there for the food
I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was better than anything I'd ever had in my many trips to the south
Sorry, Carolina
The slaw was fresh and the baked beans side was a meal in itself
My friend had very respectable dry-rub pork ribs
They also were very good, but good ribs are common
No frills, very inexpensive
The highest quality
There is no place to sit down
They charge for water - can't get just a cup
The food is good
I would go back
I absolutely love the bowl o' red from my local Daisy May lunch cart (6th and 50th st)
For $6 I get a hearty, delicious lunch
is something to be desired
I highly recommend the food - as with any dining establishment, the overall experience is balanced by the service
The service is poor, delivery is often very late, and attentiveness by the individuals working there is sub par
The woman picking up the phone - well, best said as having no clue how to deal with customers
I cannot rely on Daisy May for any of my corporate catering - why should I spend hundred of dollars to be embarrassed by late delivery
Regardless of how good the food is, it means nothing if it is cold and late
If I was walking by or had direct intentions to dine there, I certainly will
Go for the food, but expect nothing from the service
Daisy May's is the REAL DEAL! No other NYC BBQ place even comes close to traditional BBQ
They have two pulled porks both are awesome
The creamy spinach is delicious as is the Dirth Cajun Rice
Do not miss Daisy May's
The staff and I at my bar have ordered 5 days in a row! Daisy May's is the BEST BBQ in New York City a city that needs to know what true traditional BBQ is!
Sure it's way the heck on the West Side (46th 11th Ave) and it's a trek and a half to a small hole-in-the-wall with no seating, but MAN is it worth it!!!! I had the Memphis Dry Rub pork ribs and my company had the Oklahoma Jumbo Beef Short Rib, with sides of creamy corn, mashed sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, and baked beans
all of which were so incredibly delish - the meat literally falls off the bone
And don't forget to try the sweet tea in mason jars
you'll never have regular iced tea again

There CAnadian Bacon strips for an appetizer are a bacon lover's dream
I love this place
I live in Manhattan, and was at Luger's today, TUESDAY, JULY 9
No reservations
2 of us
My wife and I! Got there at 7:10 pm
Sat down at 7:30
CAll before hand to see if you can just go, if you are only2 or 3 people
Usually the wait is 20 minutes WITH RESERVATIONS
But its the BEST
Just went here for the first time (at last) and had the $20
02 lunch special
It was amazing
The small (ha!) sirloin was spectacular -- tender, succulent and savory -- and even the salad and dessert (items where you might be willing to cut a steakhouse some slack) were superb
The atmosphere was pleasant and unfussy, and the service excellent
All in all, a perfect restaurant experience
Peter Luger's is one of a handful of restaurants to have extended the restaurant week offer (otherwise known as a prix fixe menu) until Sept, 2002
For $20
02 one can have salad, great steak, and cheesecake or chocolate mousse, plus friendly service
Deal applies to lunch M-F only but is well worth the treck to Brooklyn for the relaxed atmosphere and the chance to eat at a famous steak house for $20
Not very romantic but my entire family really enjoyed Peter Luger's
The steak and sides at Luger's are definitely tasty, but the legendary status it seems to hold lead me to be disappointed after the actual meal
With all the hype I've heard about Luger's, I expected it to be the best steak I've ever had, bar none
It definitely wasn't
It was actually on the lower end of the scale of top steakhouses that I've been to
It was still a decent meal, just don't expect to have a mind blowing experience at the table and you'll be OK
Whether that makes it worth a 3 week wait for reservations, well thats for you to decide
Didn't mind the beer hall decor, but what's the deal with those flourecent lights?? It felt like Monday morning at the office in there!
The food at Peter Luger's was absolutely fabulous
From the steak to the spinach to the chocolate mousse cake, everything was so good!!! I went with my husband for our 4th year anniversary
We really enjoyed our evening there
Of course, if you are looking for a romantic setting, you should look else where
This place is worst than most diners
i dont understand why this is the best steakhouse in NY
i went there last week with my boyfriend, n we were totally disappointed
if u wanna check this is best steak or not, i'm telling u!!!!! u don't have to cross the bridge (if u live in Manhattan), n pay $100 for that
i don't think it's worth it
Although sometimes inconsistent I still have to proclaim PL as the best steak house in NY
At their worst they still probably come in the top 3 and at their best no one comes even close
Only restaurant that i never want to see the menu in
steak for #, bacon all around, tomatos n onions, creamed spinach, and keep the brooklyn lagers flowing
your waiter will take care of you from there on
enjoy!!!
A nice, casual and tasty burrito place
Personally, I like Vera Cruz (on Bedford Ave
) better, but this place has it's advantages
It's quieter, a little more low-key and (maybe) a little less expensive
Big portions too
Recommended
Cono's is an amazing place
It's a pretty basic red-sauce type joint, but the quality they put into the food outshines all the rest
It doesn't hurt that their seafood is fresh and more tasty than in some places that supposedly specialize only in seafood
Their mussels are incomparable
The broth may be simple to make, but nobody does it quite so well
I'm always severely tempted to pick up the bowl and just down the broth like a viking
The waitstaff is charming and knowledgeable about the menu
And about wine
And about other things, too, I bet
I just haven't asked them about other things
Anyway
I recommend things with seafood and DO try wine lover's night
Don't just get a 20 dollar bottle for ten
Get a big expensive one and you're really saving more that way if you think about it
And it's totally worth it
Love it
It's the kind of neighborhood place where you want to be a regular
Tuesdays are Wine Lovers nights, where everything on their wine list is half off - it's a great deal
My fiance and I always get mussels a la Cono and linguine a la Cono, but all the other pasta dishes I've tried have been good or excellent
The sandwiches from the take out window are delicious too
Staff is friendly, service is excellent
THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL, BUT LET ME GO FURTHER
BOY AM I PICKY PERSON TO PLEASE BUT THEY DID PLEASE ME
THE SERVICE WAS GREAT
MY WAITER WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO ME
THE PORTIONS WERE UNBELIEVABLE
FOR ONCE I LEFT A RESTAURANT FULL
THE DECOR TOOK ME STRAIGHT BACK TO ITALY RIGHT ALONG WITH CONO SR
SINGING GOOD OLD ITALIAN TOONS IN THE BACK GROUND
THE FOOD WAS DELISH SINCE CONO SR
IS FROM ITALY AND BROUGHT MAMA'S COOK TO WILLIAMSBURG
THE PRICE IS VERY, VERY, RESONABLE CONSIDERING THE HUGE PORTION YOU WILL GET
AND LISTEN UP MOM'S IT IS KID FRIENDLY
SO HAVE A NIGHT OUT AND TELL JOE THE BARTENDER I SENT YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I food this restaurant in citysearch
I do not regret going
Food was awesome
Came to Williamsburg for a visit and heard about Cono's thru a freind
Had a great meal and had a good time talking to Joe the Bartender
Real freindly staff
The Right Bank is a great place to drink
Their food ain't bad either, but first and foremost it is a great place to drink
It is is warm and dingy and dim and welcoming
It is off the beaten path enough not to suffer from the decrepitude of most of Williamsburg, and yet not so far away at all
It will never, ever, ever catch on with people looking for some new place to make trendy
And that's a damn good thing
Go there, sit outside on the porch if the weather's nice, and drink a bunch of beers
You'll be glad you did
Raymunds dishes up the best Polish comfort food Ive ever had outside of my great-aunts kitchen
On those chilly days when all you want to do is stuff yourself sillyRaymunds is the place
I highly recommend the potato and cheese pierogis and the polish kielbasa entreesbut the real stars on the menu are the sides

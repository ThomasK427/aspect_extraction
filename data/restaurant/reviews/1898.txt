But if you believe in the so-called hipness - then join the queue!
Believe the hype! Tomoe Sushi is one of, if not the best, sushi restaurants in NYC
If you want to avoid the long lines, arrive at 5:00 PM and have an early dinner
There's nothing fancy about the interior, but the sushi makes up for the lack of ambience
I have sushi several times a week, and I have to say the Tomoe Sushi is freshest sushi in all of New York
Tomoe definitely provides its diners with excellent quality sushi and sashimi, although the quality does not justify the exhobitant costs
Without appetizers or desserts, we spent $100 for two people
While impressed with the flavor and tenderness of the fish, the quality is not so much higher than other nearby sushi restaurants and significantly pricier (for a more reasonably-priced alternative and a far better overall dining experience, try Yama on Carmine Street)
If you dine as I do, the moment you leave a restaurant is the you know whether the experience justifies the cost
For Tomoe, it does not
This is definitely one of my all time favorite Japanese restaurant
The line outside can be outrageous at times but once inside your mouth will water as dish after dish of the freshest sushi is served (not necessarily at your table
haha)
Its just fabulous! Don't let the long wait scare you
its a must try!
i've dined here twice and both times were absolutely satisfying
try going there for early dinner to avoid the long wait
I should've taken the advice of the previous reviewer and skipped this place, but I was hopeful
The wait was only half an hour on a Friday night
We sat at the sushi bar, which was more private than the tables
Having started with a great cooked toro appetizer, we looked forward to the entrees
I ordered the sushi-sashimi combo and my husband ordered 9 pieces a la carte
Size-wise, I was impressed, but to our disappointment, nothing was good
We are sushi connesuiers and know what different types of fresh raw fish should taste like
The fish ranged from ok to somewhat off
The only thing I really enjoyed was the octopus
Our bill was a reasonable $50 a person, but even at that value we will not be coming back
very fresh, very large pieces of fish
long wait to get in but worth the wait
We went to this restaurant based on CitySearch recommendations and I am bummed that they were not more accurate
We stood outside in the cold for an hour-and-a-half, (no joke), to be seated at a tiny table for two, smack next to two other couples
We could all hear one another's conversations as well as reach over and pick food off one another's plates if we were so inclined
Our waiter was very nice and accommodating, but we really came here to have good raw fish, and we DID NOT find it
The tuna was stringy and not sliced well
salmon was not pink enough
Very small choice of rolls
Overall, BIG disappointment
I have had much better experiences elsewhere
i could be sitting with the devil and still be in heaven!!! i would even sit with my dad again if i were here! I love this place and everyone i took here has made to a point that this is the best sushi and we need to go again
i think i was 9 when i first came here now i'm 25
i've travelled and tried to find better but nothing comes close, especially for the quality and price
there are no words to describe it!!! growing up i told myself i need to get an amex card
that's the only thing they accept
whenever i have a bad day, this is the place to go, not only for fod but it's a part of me loving new york city!! my brother couldn't agree more!!!
Sushi was fresh -- the sushi / sashimi combination offers such a variety of fish - yellowtail, tuna, salmon, salmon tar-tar, rolls, shrimp, squids, scallops, etc
It was definitely worth every dime
This is the best sushi in NYC
There is a huge line, usually a 45 minute wait; they take no reservations and no tables of more than five people
The sushi, is out of this world
Ive had sushi in Tokyo and this is by far better than that
Nothing is like Tomoe
The portion sizes are generous and the service is amiable and attentive
Fresh and tasty sushi
Not cheap, but not expensive
Amex only, and a funky schedule early in the week (no lunch on Mon or Tue
closed Sunday)
Still, my favourite sushi restaurant in North America
always crowded but worth the wait
the fish is cut in giant chunks, but is SO very tasty and fresh
the spicy toro tartar is great as well
i was surprised, given the atmosphere of the place -- inside it's very homey and busy and not trendy, but the food is excellent and worth the price
This place was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is Japanese
She told me that it is the best sushi she has had in NY (price was not a factor for her)
I was very skeptical when I had to wait in line for a while before I could order, but once my food arrived I was in DISBELIEF as to how fresh the sushi was
This stuff MELTS like butter in your mouth and it is truely UNBELIEVEABLE! There IS a reason why there is ALWAYS a line outside this restaurant
Some may say the ambience is not the greatest, but I consider it to be true Asian style dining (intimate)
Tomoe is the place to go for great sushi
Anywhere else, then you are just paying for the ambience and not the quality of the sushi!
their sashimi melts in your mouth
pricy, but so worth it!
The sushi is comparable to the best of Japan
No exaggeration
It, literally, melts in your mouth leaving your taste buds wanting more
The sushi is just heavenly!!
I would recommend ordering take out because the place is always crowded
FOOD is EXCELLENT and FRESH!!! a must try
Very busy restaurant, waits are usually 30 min
minimum
Qulaity of the seafood is EXCELLENT!! Nothing fancy, but great skills of selecting the fish
Space are jammed, the Portion are huge, not like the other traditional sushi places, although house is obviously too small for the size of the portion cuts of the SUSHI!!
Best Sushi/Sashimi in the city - two thumbs
Reservations are not accepted
When my friend and I got the sushi deluxe, we were rather appalled at the presentation
The sushi looked less clean cut and a bit rushed
And yet, upon tasting it, the sushi was by far, one of the freshest I've ever had
We deduced the sloppy presentation to the rush of people and the fact the Tomoe actually filleted their own fish! The sushi is a tad expensive, but everything else on the menu is reasonably priced
And even though we got there at 5:30, by 6, there was already a line waiting outside for our table! The service wasn't as bad as previous reviews make them out to be
The key is your own timing
Good sushi, but get there early!
If you want the freshest sashimi in town without paying an arm and a leg, this is the place to go
I highly recommend the tuna tartar and sashimi appreziters
Portion size of sashimi is generous for a Japanese restaurant
Great regular and hand rolls! As for dessert, try the banana tempura
lightly fried banana with a scoop of creamy rich vanilla ice cream! Pls
note they do not take more the 5 people for a table
Go in the earlier hours for dinner and line may be shorter but be prepare to wait anywhere from 20 mins to 1 hr
But the food is definitely worth the wait!
Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait on a Friday night
We had grilled hamachi, toro tartare, and oysters for appertizer
Excellent choice, especially the tartare

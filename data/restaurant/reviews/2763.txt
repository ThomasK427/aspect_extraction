I left and told my girlfriend about the jerk
She went back fuming mad, and told him he just lost two loyal customers, and he replied, I don't need your business
So he probably doesn't need your business either
Oh yeah, he'll also kick you out if you stay and talk after your breakfast is eaten
BEWARE OF THIS JERK
i have a friend who regularly makes up excuses to come to brooklyn just so she can eat the enchiladas suizas from calexico
definitely not for those on a health kick, but i can say, the best damn hangover food there is
Really good Mexican food
Freindly service
And great value
An alternative if Los Pollitos is closed or too busy
Lemon Grass is a standard in the Slope
Fresh ingredients, good preparation (more reliably so offpeak), and a charming space in summer are its main draws
Even better, it's historically been just a tad cheaper than its sisters in the city and it's highly takeout-friendly
I travel from Pennsylvania to get the Black Forest Cake here! It is THE BEST! Well worth the trip
So rich and delectable and reasonably priced
I TRAVEL ALL THE WAY FROM THE BRONX TO BROOKLYN FOR THEIR CAKE
I FOUND THIS BAKERY FROM A FRIEND THAT LIVES IN D
C
EVER SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS BAKERY AND ALWAYS RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS
TRY THEIR STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE WITH FRESH BUTTER CREAM FROSTING AND FRESH FRUIT TOPPING
THE STRAWBERRIES ARE THE LARGEST YOU HAVE EVER SEEN
TRUST ME! A+++ BAKERY IN NYC
THIS IS WHAT NY IS ABOUT
WAY BETTER THAN JUNIOR'S
THE CHOCALATE MOUSSE IS VERY, VERY RICH
GOT MILK?? WELL WORTH THE TRIP
They have the best cakes and cookies
One of the few places to get a good cup of coffe at a decent price, not likeI the over price chains all over the city
also got my wedding cake from them
Great price, not like those over price bakeries
Why should wedding cake cost so much
Cousin Johns Bakery and Cafe has the best prices
They coustom make your cake without over chargeing
Try their fresh berry cakes YUMMY
Great Brunch! Small place but is worth it
One of the few places where the kitchen is open and you can see the bakers making, all the goodies
They have a wide array of pies during the holiday season
Also one of the few places where you can get flourless cakes and sugarless cakes
Everything thing there is sinfully good
Nice breakfasts, muffis, cakes to order and pignoli nut pastries
Gets a trifle crowded so think about takeout rather than sitting at the claustrophobic tables to enjoy your cuppa
This has to be the best latin restaurant in Brooklyn, it certianly is the biggest one
The prices are great
It is one of New Yorks best kept secrets
I couldnt believe how big the restaurant was is has romantic spots and it also perfect for the kids
I have been to El Viejo Yayo 5 times and have had a great dining experience each time
The service is wonderful
The waitresses are so nice and will even help you pick a meal if you are new to spanish food
The food is delicious and not too expensive
The soft music is delightful and the interior is nicely decorated
I give it 2 thumbs up
I love this restaurant, its clean, service is fast and free chips and salsa! Food is delicious! One of my faves
This is my first time eating there and as a first time let me tell you that the food was excellent and very affordable
The service was great
Once you enter it has wall doors that are able to open so during the summer the nice air from outside comes inside the restaurant
It is very relaxing and I would return to this restaurant because it is great!
I have had nothing but good experiences at the Santa Fe Grill
It isn't overly fancy, but it's pleasant and comfy
The food is good and very reasonably priced (I usually get the specials, which have all been wonderful), the service is friendly and helpful but not overbearing, and the margaritas (super hi-test!) are good enough to please even my tequila-snob friends
Nine times out of ten, when I want dinner in the Slope, this place is it
Never had a bad meal, they have really really good frozen drinks too!!!
i have been visiting santa fe for at least 5 years now and I can't possibly say enough about what a great place this is
the food, the service, the atmosphere
even the parties that they throw are amazingly fun
It is by far my favorite place to eat, and I try to bring a new friend with me every time I go
I agree withth e above reviews--particularly nice in the summer with the wall-doors open onto the street--right in the heart of Park Slope on 7th Ave and Lincoln Place and a 5-minute walk to gorgeous Prospect Park
I like the combination fajitahs--w/steak, chicken, and shrimp
They were also nice enough to let me bring my own fat-free sour cream to the table---I know, I know--why bother if you're not gonna eat the fat-full stuff
Great frozen margaritas; the place has been in existence nearly 20 years now (I think)
Depending on what you order, the food is anywhere from just ok to very good
But, as another user points out, the drinks usually make up for the difference
Good daquiris and margaritas!
A great place to catch a margatira, especially in the summer when it's more like a sidewalk cafe
The food is okay, nothing to shout about, especially given the other options for Mexican in the vicinity
Wait service is hit and miss, but the bar os pretty good on a regular basis
A cute place, good service, great food
Recomendations are:  steak fajita( medium), bocades especiales and Sangria with extra cherries:) it worth to try! Enjoy
We had one of the worst restaurant experiences ever at this place
the owner was even there at teh time and did not apologize to us that our food was late, cold, and the bartender told us we had to go to the kitchen and get it ourselves
He himself said if he had such a bad experience, he would never go back
Do not go here, you will be disappointed
I work with Japanese, and Geido is one of the few restaurants in the neighborhood which they frequent
Not an upscale place, but just really tasty food and a funky atmosphere at unbeatable prices
Undoubtedly, one of the best values around
I'm no sushi connoisseur, but the food there is so delicious, and such a good value
I don't live anywhere near the neighborhood, but I still go there every few months for the Chirashi box
Love this place
The staff is really nice, and the stuff painted on the walls is cute
If you want to try new things ask for the cheese katsu and beef nagamaki!!! but remember that everything is great!!  Excellent service and nice atmosphere
They don't accept reservations therefore go early during the weekend if you don't won't to wait!
This is the only place in Brooklyn, possibly NYC, that I can get a good, Osaka-style okonomiyaki
They do not use the common Otafuku brown sauce, which to me is a good thing, because I prefer the kind of sauce I got in Osaka
Geido's sauce is not as sweet, which is good for me
And, their okonomiyaki doesn't have that dry bread-like texture that the okonomiyaki has at places like Kenka or Yokocho in Manhattan
I highly recommend Geido's food, it's close to eating in Japan
just, in New York it's probably hard to get ingredients as fresh as they have there, without it costing the customer huge amounts of money
So I can't fault them for that
All around, a good experience, and I go back often
Prepare to wait, however the food was excellent

The event manager was very helpful, the host who was in charge that day managed to seat all 12 of us 1
5 hour early when I called in the same day to request it
They are all very nice and efficient
Food is fantastic for the price
Will definitely go back
I went there last night with my friends, the place was so crowded and noisy
We made a reservation and still have to wait 15mins to be seated
The food was horrible, the fish was over cooked and too salty
The steak was bad, and it taste like they boiled the steak instead of grill (it supposed to be grill)
You can find any restaurant in NYC is better than this one
nothing great, just average
but prompt seating and friendly staff
This is my favorite restaurant in NYC
The jazz room cannot be beat
Service is excellent, and the food and ambiance make it a great value!
We went for a tame bachelorette party dinner
It is great for large groups! The place is large but very cozy
The service, ambiance and food were amazing
I am a non-fish eating vegetarian so I was a little hesitant of finding something on the menu
They were very accommadating and prepared a side dish as a main course
I highly recommend this restaurant!!!
I had been looking forward to eating here and always heard great things
I made reservations for the jazz room
An hour later and 60 bucks later at the bar (which only probably got us 3 drinks) we were finally seated
The service and food were pretty good but for the price you are paying I expected better
I also found the Jazz Room a bit loud and often found it hard to have a conversation
I'm certainly not saying it was the worst but i certainly didn't think it lived up to all the hype
I've been going to Blue Water for years
The service has gone down hill
I ordered the Lobster Mash and it was horrible
The manager offered to bring more, but I declined
He did not take it off the bill
Then was there a month later and order the seafood 3 tier entree
The ceveche was horrible, the crawfish was spoiled, the mussels did not even have the meat in them
The server offered to have the chef come out and he did not
The manager came out in his place
He offered to comp our apps and sent a round of sparkling wine
The atmosphere is good
Only a little loud for my taste
I like smaller, quieter places
This is definitely not it
The jazz room is great, there's live jazz playing
The service is great, the staff is nice and friendly
The rolls and sushi are good while the main course food is average - not so great, small portions and overpriced
The dessert is delicious
Overall, I would probably recomend just to go check it out since it is such a popular place
However, this would not become one of my often-visited restaurants
Blue Water is restaurant eqivalent of a beautiful girl who getsyou excited because she looks great, but is mind-numbingly dull when you finally engage her in conversation
It has a great bar scene, and a nice jazz room downstairs, but the food is consistently disappointing; good, but not great
If you don't require the scene, there is much better seafood in the neighborhood
I love this place! Excellent service, delicious food (try the Lobster Mashed Potatoes) and an atmosphere with a good NYC feeling
I recommend the Jazz Room
The music is the perfect accompaniment to the dining experience
Good date place, perfect for hosting out-of-town vistors and fun with colleagues
Great, great, great!!!
My date and I were excited to go, and didn't even mind the 25 minute wait (EVEN WITH OUR RESERVATION) to get a table
I ordered the 14 oz Grilled Sirloin and my date had the lobster and scallops
We had an overpriced bottle of chardonnay and a Spider Roll appetizer
The roll was fine, but nothing special
My steak was better than expected although the cut of meat wasn't the best
I've had far better for less at the big steak houses
Her food came cold and she was very displeased
Overall, typical New York City
you pay for the ambience and to be able to say you've been there, the food was only slightly above average
i don't have much complain about this place in fact i go there once in a while  but i have to say there are couple staffs who are very arrogant and unfriendly
once i called to make a reservation and it was absolutly terrible experience if it wasn't for my friend's birthday party i would have never dine there ever again
very very rude phone mannerism
this is corporate restaurant and i think training staffs are very important
staffs are face of the restaurant, and it was absolutely ugly
This is a great place
On the weekends, they have a jazz bar downstairs
The food was very well done and the desserts were even better! The prices are very reasonable as well, especially for New York
Nine people for dinner and everyone was pleased! Yes, this place can be noisy and the food is not tremendously sophisticated
However the food was very good and it offered something for each of the very different palates at our table
They were late in seating us despite our reservation for the first seating of the night
However we were made to feel very comfortable at the bar and they even brought exta chairs so we could sit together
For dinner we were seated upstairs and this allowed for us to hear each other and our noise didn't seem to bother anyone else
The waitstaff was efficient and pleasant
This is a great place for a large group
Appetizers, a bottle of champagne, dinner and coffee came to 58 total--including tax and tip, and we enjoyed three hours there
I Have been there a lot of times for brunch and
it's always great
Even if you have o wait to get a table, once you seat it's a pleasure to stay
Omlette is great and banana caramel desset is outstanding
After hearing about Blue Water Grill for years now, I findly was able to check it out for a buddys birthday
This place was Outstandinggggggg
All 7 people at my table agreed that it was one of the best meals we had ever had
The prices were a tad pricey but it really was worth it
Try the Blackened Swordfish and the Sauteed Scallop Appetizers which were to die for
I will recommend this place to anybody in need of a great dining experiences
While I prefer BR Guest's other seafood restaurants Atlantic Grill and Ocean Grill, Blue Water Grill does have great cuisine
The problem with it is that it is always overcrowded and very noisy as a result
The tables are also much too close together in parts of the restaurant
Nevertheless, the food is good enough to disregard the bad aspects of the dining experience at Blue Water
I'm sure that I'll continue to go back
The food was prepared exceptionally well
I had the special, grilled Red Snapper
it was excellent
I felt very comfortable and it had a very romantic atmosphere
I agree that the service here is not the best, so I try to go during off hours and days that are not as crowded for dinner

I think running out of things says that the kitchen doesn't have old food hanging around
Every time i've been in the staff has been courteous and non intrusive, and i end up lingering at the bar for the great late night happy hour
I'm a particular fan of the tremendous hamburger, with homemade ketchup, homemade pickles and potato salad
not potato AND salad like was mentioned in another review
Try for yourself
Beast Sized Tapas!!!!
Went to Beast in several ocations, great menu selection at affordable prices
The wait staff is young and cheerfull, specially the beautiful bartenders
Ah, also great selection of wines and imported spirits
Nice crowd of young and funky people
Had a great time
For a neighborhood boasting Cosbyseque brownstones, a coveted proximity to Park Slope and Fort Greene and a citizenry of limousine liberals, Prospect Heights has proven a barren ovum for solid eateries
For restaurants, the neighborhood's twin fallopian tubes, Washington and Vanderbilt, are speckled with the overpriced, the nondescript and the mediocre
So it was with trembling anticipation that we headed to BEAST
To put it bluntly, they failed in all regards
Despite a promising menu, our appetites were shriveled when told the chorizo and cod were unavailable
The fried manchego cheese was miniscule and no better than mozzarella sticks
The burgers were bland meatballs; no onions, no spices, nada
The accompanying baked potato was a tablespoon of tater salad and the salad was leaves of limp arugula
Although friendly, the wait staff was VERY reluctant to give us more bread, but she did recommend a pizzeria up the block
Terrific, top notch tapas
In two visits, I've had the red peppers stuffed with salt cod, which were delicious, and the lime-marinated shrimp which were a standout
Portions are generous, especially for tapas
Solicitous service and a staff that is knowledgeable about food make for a pleasant dining experience all around
The sort of goth decor is quirky but fun, and tall pours on all drinks complete the package
Great new place
Picket Fence is a hidden gem in Brooklyn
The restaurant is cozy with a welcoming atmosphere and staff
There might be a wait for brunch or even for dinner, but the quality of the food is always worth the wait
I go for brunch (at least once a weekend), but I always have tough decision on whether to pick the challah french toast with fresh fruit or the special omelet
Either way I am never disappointedmy suggestion is to bring a friend, so you can have a taste of both and enjoy the beautifully landscaped garden with a mimosa in hand
I visited this place for brunch on Saturday and was very disappointed!! I brought a party of 4 and not only was it extremely hot in the small restaurant (one large home air conditioner) the food was horrible
As I was dining I saw 2 r*aches crawling the wall near our table and 4 in the restroom! I was completely horrified!!! I can't image if they're in the bathroom that they're not in the kitchen
The french toast I ordered was thick challah bread that was undercooked!! It was disgustingly soggy in the middle
My friend ordered the sweet potato fries which were burnt and the omelet was completely browned on one side
The waitress was pleasant but what a major disappointment
Go to any other place but not here
I've been here about five times (stupid me), and each time except the very first has been progressively more disappointing
I went for lunch last weekend, and the service was awful
I waited for a table forever which wouldn't have been so bad if the wait staff had at least greeted my friend and me, and set our expectations time wise
The parties after us grumbled the same complaint
It looked like the wait staff (all 3 of them) were frazzled
There were a lot of people, but you think the manager would have planned for this
My friend and I waited 38 minutes for our food (I timed it), and when it arrived, my chicken was cold and had the consistency of rubber bands
The place seemed unkempt, and the servers were ditzy and unfriendly
I scoff at the reviews below touting a warm and friendly atmosphere
And good prices? Hardly!  Hopefully the new restaurant in the area will start serving more than just dinner
WOW i was very suprised of how great the food was
i live in park slope and recently had my first visit to picket fence
The staff is great and the food is even better, there is a wonderful garden thats is just to die for
Living in park slope i have so many options for good food , but i will definitly be taking random trips over to picket fence to eat there delicious food
The desserts are very good as well i had this choc pudding that was so good
I had not been there for brunch but heard its amazing cannot wait to try the brunch
This is a place to try and fall in love with just like i have
I love this place! The staff are very warm and welcoming, the food is to die for with a wine list that is inexpensive and very good
This place also has a charming out door garden
As far as being expensive which some have reported in previous reviews, I think that is hardly so, this place is more than fairly priced with very generous sized portions
Try the Calamari, Scallops and the Duck you will not be disappointed!
I was shocked to see the disappointing reviews that Picket Fence has recieved
As a mother of three as well as living in the neighborhood, I welcome a place that is so accepting of children
A lot of restaurants these days turn there noses up at kids and give crappy service as a result
Honestly, I would rather be around a bunch of children screaming than around annoying pretentious people having annoying city type conversations
If you want a place that is real and unpretentious, you have found it in your own backyard
As for the prices, I think they are reasonable compared to other restaurants
The food is absolutely delicious
You should definitly try the mac and chesse, its amazing
We go to picket fence all the time! I find the service to be friendly and helpful
The food is amazing and very fresh
We don't live nearby, it is worth the trip! We have never had anything but an amazing experience
I highly recommend it! Try the gazpacho and scallops - particularly perfect
As some of the other reviews below will attest, the food at Picket Fence can be inconsistent--I've had awesome meals, especially brunch, and then really bad ones
And lately the service has seemed to have gotten worse
It's the only decent restaurant in the neighborhood (though another is opening up soon) so they have the market cornered here for the time being
But if they don't get it together in terms of quality and service, it could be their undoing
Try it if you live in the neighborhood because frankly what else is there, but don't go out of your way if you don't live around here
I have been eating at this restaurant since it opened a year or so ago
And, although it has witnessed its share of growing pains (all minor, I think), it has gotten better and better
I think that there have also been some recent staffing changes in the kitchen that have greatly improved the consistency of the food
A few nights ago, my family had a spectacular meal--with a braised pork dish that rivaled any other pork dish I have ordered in this city
And--best of all? We were able to enjoy our dinner and relax even though we were dining with a toddler! The staff is terrific with children
I really think that this is one of the most refreshing restaurant options for families in Brooklyn
If you live in the area around Picket Fence, the lack of dining options is frustrating
And so you may find yourself there
Pretty unhappily there if you want more than yuppy-fam aesthetics
The food is overpriced (ie
, $4-5 for OJ, $4 for bacon, $8 for french toast) and all the loud tots can be annoying
Worst is the fact that the food is executed with such unreliability
The sweet potato fries could be tasty but usually are burnt
Burgers sometimes suffer the same fate
The atmosphere is uncomfortable (to me) and oddly cliquish with the propietor(?)/chef obnoxiously schmoozing with certain patrons and playing with his kids while ignoring the rest
If you live in the area, you may find no other options
But I wouldn't reccomend anyone make the trip out here for such an experience
The food here is decent, although sometimes it is inconsistent
One day it is good, the next, not so good
The food is also a tad bit overpriced for what it is
The chefs in the kitchen, one in particular seem quite tempermental, once I even saw one of them yelling at waiter in front of customers
Though the waiters I've encountered make the atmosphere warmer, the chef made the restaurant feel strangely tense
There are also too many loud children running all over
Picket Fence is a great addition to the neighborhood
We always have a great meal in warm and friedly surroundings with great service

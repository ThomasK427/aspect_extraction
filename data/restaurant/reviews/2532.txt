Fabulous sauerkraut and red cabbage, great weinerschnitzel
Potato pancakes are yum, too
I recommend skipping an appetizer and just diving into your entree! Tables are limited, so call ahead to make reservations
We went there last night Friday at about 9pm, and the place was great
Split right down the center is a long bar on the left, and the sit-down restaurant area on the right
The place is decked out for Oktoberfest
The patrons are cheery from the Live Polka music
Almost has a tavern-like feel
The food is lean and doesn't make you feel logy
You'd be hard pressed to go there and be disappointed with the menu selections
A place where pretentious people go, this is definitely not
Up to 2 Liters of a German beer
Family setting
Not quiet, but the Bavarian lederhosen-clad wait staff are friendly
Didn't see a dance floor, but could of easily
Decor is that of a tavern, with oil paintings
my girlfriend and I found it to be Romantic
Definitely a find worth many more visits
As the last remaining German restaurant in Yorkville, Heidelberg has endured for a reason - the food is excellent, atmosphere pleasing, and dirndl and lederhosen-clad staff amusing
Though weekday lunch time menu gets more bang for your buck, regular prices are sufficiently merited by the quality and cuisine
The restaurant may be called Heidelberg, but the true origin behind this charming tourist spot is from the Bavarian culture
True to the traditional form of southern Germany's history, the waitstaff is outfitted in overalls, knickers, embroidered dresses, and other Bavarian garb that will make anyone feel like they've wandered in Munich for Oktoberfest
As far as the food goes, the menu stays true by including authentic German cuisine, but it definitely not was the best I've ever had
At those prices, the wine and food could certainly be better
The live music is amusing, the food is pretty good, and the fresh draught beer is excellent
I thought that the sausages could be a bit more authentic, but they were still tasty, and the potato pancakes and baked Camembert are delicious
The service was also attentive and their prices are very reasonable
Good stuff all around
kraut, potato salad, potato pancakes, mixed salad, wurst, etc
My only quibble was that my Warsteiner was served closer to cool than cold, as I prefer it
The best part about it, though, was the pig knuckle
I was leary of even trying it, but it came on the wurst combo platter so I took a bite
Wow
succulent meat fell off the bone and melted in my mouth
I'm not going back without ordering the pig knuckle
Who knew German food could be romantic? Most people head to the Italians or French for their romantic evenings but we decided to make a switch
and we were more than glad
Heidelberg had great food, wonderful service and a relaxing and ROMANTIC atmosphere
I highly recommend it! Eat up and enjoy!
If I ever feel like re-living my Oktober fest days in Munich, I go here
And, if you have never experienced Oktoberfest, then this is a great introduction
Go there hungry and thirsty, if you enjoy drinking good beer and eating great German sausages then you must try the Heidelberg
Went here for Xmas
Amazing Food
Great Prices for the quality and authenticity
I would suggest this place over Rolf's anyday! Spacious place (compared to other German places)
nice beer selection in HUGE mugs (40 oz?) I suggest the potato pancakes, Goose, Wurst plate, and turkey plate
The waitstaff dressed in trad
German garb
a nice touch
I made reservations a week in advance for a family dinner
They lost the reservation and could not have cared less
In fact they were hostile that they should even care
The food was fair, atmosphere not as fun as Rolf's and I would not recommend the place
Although the old guy on the electric piano was funny
As a German in the States you always happy to be able to eat real German food
The place is great, the prices are ok, the service could be faster, but most important, the beer is great! the food is great! If you're in NY, it's an experience, especially for Americans
This is my favorite local Indian Restaurant
I tend to prefer spicier foods and have found a favorite in their Chicken Chili Massala
By no means am I a connoisseur of Indian food, but I have found this to be better than other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood
The owner is very nice and makes it a priority to introduce himself, which is not something usually done in NYC
I seldom write about a restaurant and do so only if it's exceptionally good
In this instance, after reading the rave reviews, I felt it was important to add balance
This was the worst Indian food I have ever eaten
The signature of the Indian Tandoor-Oven chet seems to be the total absence of spices   The pakoras were somewhere between red and purple in color and dripping with oil
Instead of a choice of wheat product the only option was one mega-puri with the consistency of the papad
The channa-saag and muttar paneer might have been tolerable had they had any masala at all
The raita was laced with tamarind and was quite simply inedible
I would not recommend the Indian Tandoor-Oven to anyone who knows and likes good Indian cuisine
They will be sorely disappointed
This Indian food is ALWAYS incredibly flavorful, great tasting, fresh, and plentiful
I often order delivery and I have never had a remotely average experience
The service is friendly and attentive; the delivery is fast and the food comes hot
As a vegetarian, it is extremely vital to me that a restaurant respect my dietary habits and this is the only Indian restaurant, perhaps the only restaurant period, that has consistently provided me with truly vegetarian food
I absolutely recommend this restaurant not only as a great delivery treasure, but also as a wonderful in-house dining experience
This local Indian eatery is consistently good with attentive service to boot
Been here a zillion times over the last decade and I still enjoy coming by for dinner and a drink even though I've moved a bit away from this my old neighborhood
If you enjoy shrimp, be sure to try the Fresh Shrimp appetizer
The basic curry dishers are tamer than B's (pleasantly so)
Try the namesake Tandoor Chicken for a real treat
For a bit more kick, be daring and go for the Tikka Boohna!  My only complaint is that they don't keep their tonic water in the fridge
Stick with the Indian beer instead
Have been here several times and got take-out several times
Food is always good
Service always cordial and prompt
Ambience is warm, neighborhood-friendly type, even more romantic than most Indians
I've been in this city for many years and have frequented the top 20 rated Indian restaurants in that time
This ranks in the top 5
No, not kidding, mpark
The service is fantastic
The prices are good
The decor is uplifting
The food is fantastic
This is my favorite Indian Restaurant in the city
I live in the neighbourhood and have tried places like Hatsuhana and Sushi-sei but I like this place the best for their good food with a lack of attitude (unlike the abovementioned restaurants)
Their sushi and sashimi is fresh and their sushi chefs know what they're doing
I particularly enjoy the monkfish or fluke liver whenever they have it in
Periodically, when it is bitterly cold outside, I switch over to their hot dishes instead such as their suki yaki and negimaki
Having come here often, it's nice that they remember me and I'm treated like family
Had high hopes that this would be our new neighborhood sushi joint

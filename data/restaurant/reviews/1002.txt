for a bowl of puree? While sitting on a stool? By far they win the award for the most uncomfortable
It's an ingenious idea
If it's uncomfortable they won't stay and dilly dally, better turnover
Not this feller, last time I have a $50
lunch on my knees
Finally made it here after several friends gave it high recommendations w/ the only caveat being long waits
Both their recommendations and the caveat were a little overdone
We only had to wait for half an hour for a table at prime-time on a Saturday night
On the other hand, the food was good but not awesome as had been described, furthermore I found the portions fairly small for this type of restaurant
The service was good and friendly and the old school pub was a nice ambience for this neighborhood
In summation, probably better for drinking than eating
never even got the food - the service was so bad that after waiting for almost 2 hours we left and had a great meal elsewhere - glad it is in a great dining neighborhood!
After being greeted explained about the 2 tier shelving system @ the pillars we were totally ignored by the staff
One of us went to the bar to get drinks carried them back to our pillar stools
We were never offered a menu not even out of interest
None of the nibbles a@ the bar were offered
We would have stayed tried some food but the offer never came so we went elsewhere
Very disappointed
i have never waited so long for a table before in my life
we put our name in at 7:30pm-- they told us it would be an hour wait
we did not get seated until 10:30pm
the food was average
the best thing on the menu is the knudi
the halibut was a little bland
the burger was too overwhelmed with roquefort cheese
the shoesting potato fries were good-- accented with rosemary and garlic
i don't think i will make an effort to go back
it is not really worth the wait!
I finally got a table after many times of great patience
This place is simply fantastic
The ambience, warmth, the cool people, all the great beers, the absolutely amazingly cooked and tasty divine food
I have enjoyed in the bar having great muscat with awesome desserts, have enjoyed in a table having so lovely food, great service- humorous and witty; the environment is so fantasticly energetic in the same time mellow
i simply truly love this place and would go again and again and yes, spend the time to wait for 'the' table
worth it! Prices are very reasonable
Went early on a Friday night
Was seated at a short table with little stools next to the kitchen - very tight quarters
However, liked the decor
Food was fresh, more imaginative appetizers than entrees
Homemade hazelnut ice cream was heavenly
Overall, it was very good, not amazing, and they loose points for cramming everyone in to such tight quarters
Won't rush back, but will go again after buzz dies down
We were seriously let down by our experience
The space is lovely and certainly hopping, the wine and beer selections were terrific, the wait staff was knowledgeable and pleasant
Unfortunately we had to leave after our (excellent) appetizer because the food was taking too long -- 45 minutes after we ordered, and 20+ minutes after our appetizer was cleared
The staff demonstrated no remorse, and actually admonished us for not telling us we were in a hurry (we planned for nearly 2 hours, which should not require a rush order
The manager gave us the same message on the way out, and proceeded to tell us that we were not welcome to return to his restaurant
Clearly the restaurant and its proprietors need to mature a bit to match the space and food quality, handle the buzz, and keep the customers wanting to come back after the buzz fades
This place has the authentic feel of an old English pub even though it is only a few weeks old
Food above average, service harried but pleasant
The Scene Mario Batali, partner Joe Bastianich and chef Andy Nusser shift gears with Bar Jamon, their first foray into the snacky foods of Spain
The teensy rustic-chic room--attached to sister restaurant Casa Mono--dispenses with table service entirely
Instead, Gen-X diners grab their glasses from wood cabinets, angle for stools at two communal wood tables and shout out orders
Thanks to fast-moving bartenders, wine flows and everyone's fed fast
The Food This Iberian "ham bar" offers just two: tender 14-month Navidul, and drier, intensely flavored 18-month Redondo sliced from the hind
Try both, as, like all the nibbly menu items scrawled on the bar mirror, they're inexpensive, generously portioned and accompanied with plenty of chewy, charred bread
Innovative compositions, like grilled sardines marinated "en escabeche" with red onion, and bacalao cod, bright with sweet clementines, tiny olives and sharp olive oil, arrive from Casa Mono's neighboring kitchen
Wow, very impressed with the place
If you enjoy a good bottle of wine and variety this is the palce to go
They offer a wide array of wines which was unrecognizable, but very pleased with our selections
Great prices as well
They wine bar ranged from $40-300 a bottle
Equally impressed with the tapas
They offer great compliments to the wine
The smell of toasted fresh bread smeared with fresh crushed garlic, and tomatoes filled with jamon and iberico cheese
Or the selection of aged Mancego cheese
6 mos, 9 mos
18mos, Hummm, just want you need when you are relaxing with a bottle of good wine and good friends
I went there with my father and brother - we are all from Spain - the food was good however the place is really tiny and the cost was downright obscene
They serve wine in little caraffes which are $32 and only hold about 1
5 glasses of wine, so it is essentially $21 PER GLASS of wine
The place is very tiny as well
I think this joint suffers from the NY attitude that if it's tough to get in and get a seat, it must be good
I went here with my boyfriend who is from Spain and disappointed doesn't really describe how we felt about the food
The wine was good, but overpriced
In his words a bar serving food like this in Spain would have to be closed down
I've been here a number of times and the food is always exceptional
The place is tiny and always packed, and you have to fight for a seat
Rude wait staff
Had to ask three different times for a baguette to eat with the meal, which was overpriced
Had to go home and eat a full meal
Not crowded, not hurried, truly the wine bar that everyone wants to come to, but can't fit in
Very small, 15 stools max
Was not blow away by the wine list, but it was enough to tide my date and myself over with some snacks
If she was a bit more sophisticated, she wouldn't have been impressed with the list, but rather with the clientele and atmosphere
One of the few relaxed places in Union Square
don't go if you are looking to impress on any factor outside of the fact you can have a conversation over wine
Please for your own sake, don't go to this place, the staff members are unwelcoming and don't enjoy their jobs
After a group of my friends and I had one bottle of wine the staff asked us to leave, claiming we were intoxicated
A strange claim considering it was our first bottle of wine and we had each had maybe one glass
We think the real reason we were asked to leave was because the busboy did not like the fact that we moved one chair over so all of our friends could sit down
Instead of explaining this to us he went straight to the bartender who then asked us to leave because we moved a chair! I've lived in NYC my entire life and have never encountered such an unprofessional and ungrateful business
Don't give them your money because they don't care about you or your comfort
This is something to consider for anyone planning a trip to Bar Jamon
Upon arriving there recently, I found all the seats taken, which I expected, but there was a place to stand at the bar
The bartender informed me the place was full, and the wait was 30 minutes
I was about to order a drink while I waited, but he leaned over the counter and repeated that the place IS FULL
In other words, get lost for a half-hour in the 25-degree weather
I'm confused, if a place doesn't take reservations, cutomers get to wait inside for a table, right? Standing outside, my wife and I saw others get shown the door in the same way
And that's too bad for Bar Jamon, because who'd want to return for that kind of treatment with so many other good restaurants in this city?
I enjoy Tapas very much

the space is amazing
the downstairs bar is worth walking through even if the bar is closed
there are a bunch of private rooms that are very cozy and cool
the blood orange mojito is a must!!!
Disappointing! They sat us right away even though we were not all there and did not rush us through the meal
But, after claiming to be booked (I called their PR for a reservation), we arrived at 6:00 and there were TONS of free tables that stayed free for hours
We asked for tap water/got bottled
Sent the halibut back since the peanut sauce was mostly mustard
The chicken satay was as meaty and thick as bacon strips
The desert called a bag of cookies was just that
3 greasy cookies in a plastic bag for $9
00
I could have bought better tasting bagged cookies at the deli
The worst cup of coffee in history (I can drink Maxwell house and be happy)
Lots of eye candy and laughs, but go for a drink ($12) and see the gorgeous space
The whole experience was disappointing for us
DO NOT EAT THERE
Beware of their family style dining
It pretty much means that their kitchen is disorganized and they bring out the food whenever each dish gets ready
And the portions were more single serving sizes
Besides that, the food was interesting and reasonably priced for a Jean-Georges place
Try the lounge downstair but make sure you bring the $$$ as drink prices are pretty stiff
Btw, make sure you have reservations because this is probably one of only restaurants that make you wait outside in a line
Beautiful atmosphere, friendly unpretenious service, tasty/different food and (best of all) great value for the quality and portions you get! Jean George does it again
If you like 66 you'll love Spice Market, as both have reasonable family style food served in an awesome space
The bar scene downstairs looks hot as well
Try the champagne and passion fruit drink
It's delicious
Spice Market is a unique dining experience
The food is remarkably delicious
The decor is authentic with the feeling of Casablanca
The service is excellent; all guests are treated like royalty
I would highly recommend a visit to this fine restaurant
stopped in, with a reservation of course, to try spice market
the food is good but the scene is amazing
great decor and many celeb sightings
good to see kunz back in the kitchen after so many years
spice market is a must try! especially the tuna and tapioca
Unlike certain overly picky reviewers who seem to think they know more about proper food execution techniques than a globally accoladed chef, I was extremely impressed by every element of the Spice Market experience
My friend and I did have to wait a few minutes for a table, but only because Amanda Hesser (the new NY Times food critic) showed up and, obviously, needed a copious level of attention from the greetings staff
Aside from that, the service was exemplary, up there with the best that NYC has to offer
We were impressed by most of the dishes we received and disappointed by none
The restaurant's decor is to die for
I walked in with co-workers late on a Saturday night just to check things out
The atmosphere was amazing, the music, hypnotizing! I felt like I was transported to a far off place
We sat at the bar and had some spiced almonds and some kind of wasabi flavored nuts and if that's any indication of the delights to follow, I can't wait to actually sit down to eat there
(No, I haven't dined yet) Service at the bar was friendly, willing and accommodating
I did peruse the menu and was surprised to find it very affordable and to my delight Jean-Georges himself, pristinely chef clad,was there chatting with patrons and consorting with his staff
I loved the look of the open kitchen and watched the kitchen staff deftly, all soloists, dancing to a tightly choreographed routine, moving as one
I ate at Spice Market in a party of 8
The day before, we called to add 1 person
The next morning (Saturday) at 9:30, they called to say they couldn't seat 9
When we arrived, it was empty
In fact, they seated us at a table for 10
Spice serves its food family style aka tapas
We were so tired of this trend (Casa Mono, Alta, inoteca, etc), that we requested our own portions
Our waiter actually said he would check with the chef, like they might force us to share our food
On top of it all, 5 people wanted to pay with credit cards, but our waiter refused saying the computer only accepts 3 cards
We refused to pay any other way, requiring a visit from the manager who refused until we said we'd leave without paying
It took them 45 minutes to run our cards
Spice Market thinks it is too cool for school
Using the excuse of crowd control it is turning people away at the door despite wide open tables and half full bars
Last night I had to fight to get the last member of my four person party into the restaurant
Despite the fact that the bar wasn't nearly crowded and we had been there for over an hour, it took a manager to deem him worthy enough to get him into to his very crowded, over-capacity restaurant
Meanwhile, there were tables upon tables open - and we had been saving him a seat anyway -- which was unecessary since there were so many free
Puhleeze
Now apparently it is booked for over a month
Riiiiiggghhhht
The Scene Step past the Ferraris parked out front and make your way into the candlelit lounge and dining room, where tanned scenesters sip spendy cocktails and pose in their designer duds
DJs spin pulsing house music, and there's an unabashed "look at me" vibe throughout, encouraged only by the Versace micro-skirt uniforms female servers wear, which come dangerously close to revealing a bit too much
The Food Diners are prompted to order several shareable dishes which, considering the food isn't what's drawing most of the crowd, are surprisingly good
Atkins devotees should opt for the hanger steak, perfectly tender and nicely balanced by a tangle of fresh herbs, or the seared yellowfin tuna with vibrant minted mango
A stunningly rich mix of blue and goat cheeses tops the two mini-burgers; the "club"--celery, salmon and potato, topped with caviar dressing--is another very good choice
There are very few places in the meat packing district that continue to provide a New York Vibe worthy of us TRUE New Yorkers
It seems the area is becoming oversaturated with the likes of tourists and commuters
However, one exception to this is ONE LITTLE WEST 12Th ST
Located directly across from Pastis
My Girlfriend and I went back to One (after having not have been there in over a year) the other night to celebrate out anniversary
Immediately we noticed a new Vibe in the place
It was much more like a real dining room as opposed to a nightclub that served food
We both ordered 2 excellent cocktails off the specialty cocktail list
I had the new Old Fashion and she had Pretty in Pink, a drink made with a new Vodka called PINK that is infused with Caffine and Guarana
For dinner we decided to take our servers advice and order several items to share
Some of the things we ordered were The Duck Spring Rolls, Lobster and Goat Cheese Quesadillas, Wild Mushroom Ravioli and the concluded dinner with a steak special that was out of this world
I highly recommend ONE to everyone
The service is awesome very chill and relaxed, but efficient
The Food was extremely tasty
And even if you have been there before, I encourage you to revisit it
It Rocks!
Okay we admit where gold digging girls we are hot and we know it and girls ssome of your groups know what i am talkin about not the fat pigs the fat pigs who eat there before so they can get in but we do have our femine side

But everything else was different from the frontdoor guy wanna be playgirl, to the btl services and the bartenders
it was like no one know what thy where doing
never ever ever will we come again and girls trust me
Came here after dinner at Buddha Bar
I agree with the pervious reviewer in that the crowd is a bit older ( late 20's - mid 30's?) than the usual places
Got there around midnite and the line was maybe about 15 ppl long

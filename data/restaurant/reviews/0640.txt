It is a little crowded and loud but it is a blast
I was a guest at a birthday party and we had a great time
The staff was cute and friendly and the food was fun and entertaining
The drinks were great
For a fun place to visit I think it's worth the trip
I could see my daughter loving this place
As a matter of fact I think I'm going to take her and some friends there early tonight !
Waikiki Wally's has fun, kitschy decor and a good drink menu but that's about where it ends
We got seated in the side room which did not have any heat, my feet were like block of ice throughout my meal
They brought a small heater in but the waiter kept tripping over the cord and unplugging it
The food was TERRIBLE
We got the calamari, the pork spring rolls and the pulled pork entree
I would suggest coming to this place with your co-workers for after-office drinks or maybe for a bachelorette party
Just like Lucky Cheng's -- Waikiki Wally's novelty wears quickly
This place is absolutely hilarious! It feels like you've walked into a comical version of a Hawaiian resort in the 50s
The waiters walk around in coconut shell bras and all the waitresses are cute and in bikini tops
The decor is really detailed, kitschy and fun
However, it gets really dang crowded with loud obnoxious drunks
The drinks are in the $9-12 range, but they are elaborately garnished (some with fire) - so not so bad for a special occassion
Definitley not for a quick hang out
What a great fun, relaxed, inexpensive place to go hang out
The staff was so friendly and accomodating
The noise level was perfect for conversation
It was just great - I met up with old friends there and we had so many laughs
It's a great place to hang out with your friends, chat and hear what each other is saying! And some stiff drinks!
Great Food, great people and most of all GREAT atmosphere!! Walking into a tropical rainforest, complete with waterfall, tiki hut bar, girls in grass skirts and leyes
Drinks were great and fun to share with a group of people, the shrimp rolls and rib appetizers were the best
Each of us had a different entree, all were amazing
Come enjoy the tropics and warm up with atmosphere, great drinks and food as the cold weather approaches - you won't be dissapointed!!!!!
After we got booted from the pretentious Il Posto Accanto down the block, we went to Waikiki Wally's and had a blast
We got to relax, have fun, and suck down some delicious rum drinks (oh yeah)
Not to mention the bill was extremely reasonable
We all would definitely go back
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND WERE IN THE EAST VILLAGE AND STUMBLED UPON WAIKIKI WALLY'S AND WE WERE IN NEED OF A DRINK
AND WE RAN ACROSS THIS PLACE WITH CATCHY HAWAIIN MUSIC PLAYING AND SPOTTED THIS HUGE BAR MADE OFBAMBOO HUT LIKE SURVIVOR STUFF!!! WE STARTED WITH A VOLCANO BOWL THAT WAS DELICIOUS!!! AND WENT TO PINA COLADAS AND THE REST IS HISTORY !!! WE HAD A LOT OF FUN THERE
THE STAFF WAS SO FRIENDLY THAT WE ENDED STAYING THERE THE WHOLE NIGHT!!! I DIDNT HAVE THE FOOD BUT IT LOOKED AND SMELLED GREAT!!!!
I stopped by Wally's for a drink after a dinner party at Lucky Cheng's
I was so transported that I came back the next night for dinner
The food was devine and the drinks will blow you over! The atmosphere is so kitsch! Right out of an episode of Gilligan's Island
A must for warming up on a cold winter evening
What do you expect from the owners and management of Lucky Cheng's?
RECENTLY THREE OF MY FRIENDS TOOK ME FOR A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY DINNER,AND I WAS PLEASANTLY THRILLED AND DELIGHTED THAT THEY CHOSE WAIKIKI WALLY'S!!! NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS IN FOR I STEPED INTO TO THIS LAVISHLY DECORATED PARADISE THAT KIND OF RESEMBLES DISNEY MEETS THE ISLE OF WAIKIKI HAWAII!!!! I WAS IMEDATELY LEIGHED AT THE FRONT DOOR BY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT LOOKED VERY EXOTIC,CLAD IN BIKINI TOP AND GRASS SKIRT
THE FOOD WAS FABULOUS I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THE RIBS AS A STARTER THEY ARE REALLY DELICIOUS!! FOR DINNER I HAD THE PANKO CRUSTED OPAH FISH, WHICH THE SUPPER FRIENDLY HAWAIIN MANAGER BRIE INFORMED ME AS HE PERSONALLY WISHED ME A HAPPY HAWAIIN BIRTHDAY, WHY MAKING SURE WE WERE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH OUR MEAL ,WHICH WE WERE!!!I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE THE STAFF IS FRIENDLY GOOD LOOKING AND VERY UPBEAT! DEFINATELY CHECK THIS FABULOUS PLACE OUT !!!!
poor unattentive service that was suddenly attentive when it came time for the bill
drinks are alright but nuttin special
tropical decorations are alright
would not go there again
even tho i live right across the street from it
Unfortunately, the interior, nor the drinks are good enough to have me recommend this place to anyone
Our group of six waited 1/2 an hour for drinks, that were good but nothing great
We wandered into the karaoke room of Lucky Cheng's and enjoyed ourselves much more
my date didn't show and i was bummed but the staff was so accomodating, i was distracted
Then, the Tiny Bubble Band started to play
it was totally entertaining and fun
The food and drinks were really good - i think this is one of the only truly Hawaiian restaurants in the city - you know, with grass skirts, waterfall, giant tiki statues, etc
The best part of the evening is that I left WITH a date!
EXOTIC
the food and the drinks were fun, delicious and inventive and the decor will make you feel like bob denver on good acid
Janine, our cute and lovely waitress was fun, attentive and animated
Bottom Line: The Food and drinks were good, the crowd sucked, the service sucked and the menu is pretty minimal
After a while, the whole Hawaiin can look like a bad Brady Bunch Vacation episode
We ate there last night
I am not a cranky person but I was moved to write because I was shocked at how bad the place was! The room is small; there is a bar where people smoke
But the smoke drifts throughout the room, since there is no ventilation
They made an effort with decor but the lighting is ordinary, with the result that there is no atmosphere
The server was affable but incompetent
The minute we sat down he asked us what we wanted to drink (there is a nice Hawaiian-themed drink list that takes a minute to get thru) and when we asked for a minute we got about 20 instead
Then he brought us our drinks one by one, which seemed inefficient
After another long lapse we ordered
I got the steak ($21)
It was funky
My stomach hurts today
I hope it was really beef!
Just had my daughter's birthday party here
Brie, the manager, was fabulous, both on the phone and at the party
Her friends have been calling all weekend to say it was the BEST party - complete with hula dancing and fun food!
I discovered this amazing place by accident
I had taken some out of town corporate guys and their wives to a place around the corner, Lucky Cheng's, had an amazing meal there
We were headed to the car on Second Street and there was Wakiki Wally's! Had a nightcap at the bar and made reservations for the following Friday
Well all I can say is from the Don Ho host who greets you to the over top cocktails to the fabulous food to the model wall street types waiting to get in, Waikik Wallys is a jewelof a find
I don't understand the negative ratings of this restaurant!!! Went there for my sis's 40th b-day a few weeks ago
The food was absolutely to die for, and our waitress was very attentive
The decor was over the top and fun
The manager, who is from Hawaii, was very helpful
The biggest asset of this restaurant, however, is Mr
Cheng, the busboy, who gave us leis, coconut bras and grass shirts!!!! We all agreed that it was one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had and I have reservations to go again next week!!
I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday at waikiki wally's and it was SO MUCH FUN! HUGE tropical drinks, really great food and great decor - total party place
We had a set menu which worked out really well for the group
The service was good, too
We all loved it and stayed at the bar for hours afterwards
It's really easy to have a great time here
I came to this resturant for my 8 year old cousins birthday
he loved it there and so did I the food was great, it's a cool place to be in
when youre in there it feels like your in hawaii
because the bamboo,the water fall the tropical birds, and the hula dancers
i cant wait till i go there again  my cousin loved the birds
the owner let me and him hold the birds
the big white one was our favorite
Try this : Get there by 10
00pm, have the best hawaiin food (excellent sea food by the way), and then head to the bar

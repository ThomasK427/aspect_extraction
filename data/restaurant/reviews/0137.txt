With the energy of the dining room it was like having 200 friends over for diner
The steaks were great
I loved the green beans and asparagus
The cocktails in the bar unmatched
Then dessert, the pie martinis (tasty) and the chocolate porterhouse cake were too cool
I just went to Dylan Prime for my birthday and had one of the most FABULOUS dining experiences ever - amazing food and spectacular service
The cheese fondue was delicious; the steak was sublime - with a lovely bordelaise sauce, as recommended by my very knowledgeable server; the horseradish mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were delightful; the drinks were awesome; and the dessert, an extraordinarily delectable molten chocolate cake with ice cream, was superb - replete with birthday candle and all
did I mention how phenomenal the service was?? Really and truly, I enjoyed every single moment of my time in this fantastic restaurant
Great Steak
Great Drinks
Great Service
Great Website
This is a restaurant with a lot of thought put into it
GO!!!!!
I was at Dylan Prime a few of weeks ago with some friends and had a wonderful time at the lounge bar
We were served some of the best mixed martinis in the city by a very attractive and tall asian bartender
She made our night! The food was wonderful, and the vibe of the bar was very comfortable
Chic but not snobby
Cheers Dylan! Keep the cold drinks comming
Dylan prime is 'off the beated track' but certainly worth a visit
With much more than just steak, the menu has grown since I was first there a lot
Service was GREAT - our waiter went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our meal
Steak cooked to perfection, sides were execellent (if not a bit on the small side for what you'd be used to at a steakhouse)
I wouldn't go here for a true steakhouse experience, it's more of an upscale downtown restaurant with a great martini menu, fabu service, and a pension for a good piece of red meat
Be sure to sit in the main dining room for a more romantic visit, bar upfront is loud but enjoyable
The steak was great, my dates halibit was delicious, loved the sides (green beans and muushrooms)
I drank beer, but I tried her apple martini, It was great not sour at all
Waitress was friendly, busboy was attentive
Table next to us got a bit loud, but that's part of dining out
Thank you citysearch for helping me find this place!
I was quite disappointed with this place, food was over priced and my steak was so burnt it was barely recognizable
But the worst part was the waitress; for a restaurant of this standard I expect better, she would have been more suited at TGI Fridays! She was simply unprofessional, bordering on rude and even got our check wrong without apology
There are better places to spend your money
i love their steak and all the sauces
wish service was better
went of a friday, wasn't that busy there but the wait staff is very, very, very slow
the water guy was extremely attentive, thank god he was because we had to ask him for our waitress many times: for ordering our food, more drinks, dessert and check
like i said it wasn't busy that night - many tables empty
We started with some fabulous bellinis at the bar
We were seated in a cozy corner booth and started with a delicious salad and great lobster bisque
The main corses on Prime Rib and the carpetbagger were perfect
But the best part of the meal were the truffle oil pototoes, by far the best potatoes I've ever had
The whole experience couldn't have been better
For $$$$ I expected better service, food and drinks
Drinks SUX, food were just Ok, and the service were not living up the $$$$ standard
Seriously go elsewhere if you are paying this kind of money for this kind of experience!
I have been coming here on my birthday w/ my steak snob father for 3 years
My father has never not sent a piece of meat back and looked disgusted
until Dylan Prime
He ordered his PR black blue
It actually came out black blue
He loved it
I wasn't even eating red meat at the time of our 1st visit
I had the salmon; possibly the best I've ever had
I've never had one complaint here
The service is A+, as is the food
We met up in the bar, where the drinks were pricey but generous
It's incredibly expensive, but I still rated it as a value because this is the price you pay for perfection in all facets of a dining experience
In fact, I'd pay more
Personally, I loved this place
I am a martini guy - vodka, not gin - and their classic martini with blue cheese olives is pretty damn near definitive
And they know to shake it until it's cold - and keep going
I followed this up with a Carpet-bagger steak - a beautiful marbled prime steak, stuffed with oysters, and then a guinesss, brown sugar glaze?   And then I had my arm twisted to try one of their dessert martinis - a pietini
We had a round for the table, so I got to try several
This is the best way to do this, because once you've tried one, curiousity will make you want to sample them all
Everything I tried tasted EXACTLY like the dessert it was named after
A little upscale, but if you're looking for an impressive place to take a client or a date, I wouldn't hesitate
So, good
We had a couple drinks at the bar
before dinner
It was a wonderful Saturday evening and all the windows in the front were open
Food was great
THe cheese fondue was excellent, as were the steaks, wine, and sides
If your going on a date call ahead for a more private seating area like the booths, those were great
Dylan Prime was a huge disappointment
The worst part, by far, was the service
Our waitress was merely inattentive at first but became just plain hostile after we had the nerve to ask about the wine we had ordered to go with dinner (we were halfway through our entrees and still no wine)
In terms of the food, the mixed green salad had no flavor and my medium rare tuna was an unappetizing shade of gray
The famed martinis are more gimmicky than tasty
Good mashed potatoes, but they are definitely not worth the pain of enduring another meal at this place
New York is filled with wonderful restaurants
Why on earth is this place so popular???
This place is great frome head to toe
The drinks are awesome
I love martini's and they're apple martini is the best I've ever had
The lounge/bar area is really cool and laid back
The food is great and everyone was really nice
the place is very low key and very inviting
I went labor day weekend and I think I'll be going back at least once a month
My friend told me I'd say that when I tried one of their pietini dessert cocktails and I did
I had the peach cobbler she had the keylime pie
We went to the bar where we drank mojitos
We ordered beef wellingtons, calamarie and fried oysters all really good
Then we drank our desserts
I'm really looking forward to going back and having diner in the restaurant part (and dessert in the bar)
If you have not been here GO!!! the steak is the best i have ever had
the drinks kick butt and the service is great
i went with 5 other people and everyone loved it, I can't wait to go back
Was there this past weekend
Very nice decor, service was great

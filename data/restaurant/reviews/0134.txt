She was very nice
I had a dual reason for coming as I had also been looking for a place to bring a group of friends for a small dinner gathering later in the month
I asked her if they had an area to accommodate a group of about twenty
She brought us to a back section that was very charming with lots of large plants and a glass ceiling
It had been very sunny that afternoon and I must admit that the room looked very bright and inviting
We proceeded to order our meals and the food was pretty good
The wait staff left a lot to be desired
They were not very friendly or attentive (it was early afternoon so the place wasn't very busy)
As we were walking out after we had paid the bill, I stopped by the counter to ask the heavyset man if there was a business card I could take with me
I explained that I was thinking of bringing a group of friends there at another time
He then proceeded to lecture me on how his was a family restaurant and not one for noisy parties
I was a little taken aback by his response and presumption
I am a 40 year old professional
On that day, I was wearing business casual attire
I tried to explain that he must have misunderstood me, but the I don't give a damn expression he had on his face, told me that I was wasting my time
Never again will I return there
For a great Greek restaurant, with delicious food, Stamatis is where I will be taking my business
I was disappointed with the overall service and food when you order takeout in person
First off, I was given a dirty look when I was looking at the menu and had gotten a nasty yes reply instead of what would you like? The pastisio platter especially because you get a good amount of salad that's dry as the sahara desert, three wedges of bland potatoes, and a thin slice of microwaved pastisio that was awful for $9
25 but when they ask if you want bread they add
75
Gimmee a freakin break! That's $10
00 for $1
00 worth of ingredients
I don't know why people are making such negative reviews about this place
I live in the neighborhood and it is by far my favorite place to go
The food is awesome
I highly recommend the spanikopita (the best in Astoria in my book) and the bifteki (ground beef kabab)
Also the ambience is REALLY cool
The first couple times I went there I just thought it was a takeout place until I discovered the hideaway restaurant in back
They also have a really nice courtyard which is a perfect place to eat in the summertime
For some strange reason you don't hear the N train which runs about 50 feet away from the place
I've never had a problem with their service, though I know how one bad apple can totally ruin a person's impression
My girlfriend and I go here atleast once every two weeks
The food is great! The lemon potatoes, spinach pie and souvlaki are outstanding
service is hit and miss
Sometimes it takes forever to get another beer or refill on water but oh well
The hostess is always gracious and the prices can't be beat!
Me and my boyfriend went to Opa! Opa! for our anniversary last october and were very dissapointed in the quality of the food
We had heard good things about the restaurant and my boyfriend has been there in the past and thought it to be good but we were disappointed this time around
The chicken was horrible but I will say that the lemon potatoes were great
Enjoyable funky interrior--especially the bumpy, white, plaster ceiling
The food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters
Creamy appetizers--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas
HOWEVER, I stopped going to Opa! because the waiters need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars
I ate at Opa! several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy
Finally, I got sick of the bad service, obnoxious smirks, and snotty back talk
As of march 2002, I now walk the extra distance and pay more for meals to avoid feeling like dirt for asking for a place setting
Consistently good food and always fast service! Go with an appetite because the dishes are big enough for two
The 'Bandeja Campesina' is worth the subway trip from Manhattan
Sunday afternoons are always bustling but the service is fast and friendly
We go to Tierras Colombianas every few weeks and the food is consistenly delicious
The portions are great for the price and the svc is always fast and friendly
If you live in L
I
C
/Astoria area, you must try this spot, and if you live in the city, you must take the N/W to try it
It's worth the trip!
They have a large variety and food is like home made
It seems like it is traditional Colombian food
The only problem is that they don't accept credit cards (there is an atm inside but they charge a fee)
The decoration could have been nicer, it looks like a diner
I've been going to Tierras Colombianas in Roosevelt and in Astoria since I was a little girl and love the food
Huge portions, delicious food and cheap
So much better than the so-called Latino restaurants in Manhattan
The first time I came here, I was overwhelmed by the menu so I asked the waitress what she recommended
She suggested something, a steak-type dish, and it came
I ate one bite, hated it, and asked if I could have something else
I don't know why, but she wouldn't be accomodating
She said they couldn't do that
So I had to spend a lot of money eating just rice and beans and the little salad that came with the gross steak
However, I did come back again with some friends and this time I ordered a chicken dish that was amazing
The portions are huge, and the lines are long
I've been going to Tierras for 20+ years, first to the one on Roosevelt
This one on broadway is at a much better location, neighborhood-wise
The food is amazing (try the Carne Asada and ask for the green hot sauce) and the chefs have never had a bad day since inception
The staff has always been helpful, accomodating, and quick
Dont go for the scenery, go because your tummy will thank you! Definetly worth the trip
One thing - They still dont accept credit cards, so be sure bring cash
Muy Excellente! Ok, it's not the fanciest place in town, the decor while clean, is nothing special
But, the food is delicious, and cheap for the amount of food that you get
Definitely go on an empty stomach, otherwise you won't be able to move afterwords
Wondefrul latin food, far better than most of the trendy latin places in Manhattan
Greek desserts at this late-night cafe
In Short Ommonia is a luxurious coffeehouse consisting of two rooms graced with green plastic and neon lights
The bakery counters are stocked with delicacies like kaidaf, a concoction of shredded wheat, honey and nuts, and all kinds of Greek coffees, alongside American coffee--and pizza
There's always a large Greek crowd frequenting this cafe, which stays open very late most nights, or, rather, mornings
Ommonia is great for sitting outside, having dessert and drinking coffee
When the sun goes down the little candles are lit and the trees and flowers are perfect
You must taste the tiramisu and the caramel cake
Are there still people in Astoria that haven't tried this place? If you are looking for amazing desserts and pastries, this is the place to go
I've never tried their 'regular' menu, i
e
sandwiches, entrees, etc, but their cakes and pies are top notch
Be warned, it can get pretty crowded on weekends and also quite noisy, especially if the piano player is in
But if you don't feel like dealing with all that, just walk up to their takeout counter and enjoy your cheesecake in the privacy of your own home
In Short Patrons here include famous Greek movie stars and lively folks with time on their hands and dollars in their pockets
The seating for Athens spills out on the sidewalks on three sides, making for fun summertime noshing

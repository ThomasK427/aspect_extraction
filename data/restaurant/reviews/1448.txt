I would recommend this restaurant to even the most discerning of restauranteurs
Went here for a friend's bday on my suggestion after reading a few good reviews
Extremely disappointed! Service was horrible
Waitress didn't even speak english and we had to call her over every time we wanted to order
even dinner!! The drinks were ok but i have had better caipirinhas before
The worst part of all was the food
It tasted like it was cooked hours earlier and then microwaved before they served it
I was embarassed that I was the one who suggested going there
Your sure to find better brazilian food in NYC
samba-le' is a fun, lively place---the music is great, the staff is fun and laid back, and the food is very good and unlike anything else you may have had before (a blend of italian and brazilian cuisine)
it is also pretty affordable
overall, a real find
I went into Samba le after work for drinks with friends and ended up staying all night
The food was amazing, tapas style I think we tasted everything on the menu
Don't forget to order some Sangria and the Gnochi
Mmmmm good!
Cool place, good music, great vibe
Came here to celebrate a friend's bday
Will definitely return for the awesome caipirinhas (another friend loved the white sangria)
Drinks were surprisingly cheap given how good they were (nothing over $8)
Heard the food is good too but had too many caipirinhas to remember
I was walking up Avenue A the other day and I saw the cutest colorful awning and stained glass windows
and wondered what new restaurant had opened
I decided to stop by with my friends another night
Dinner was delicious, reasonable and well priced! Yeah- about time!!! What a cozy, cozy environment! The music was great! Especially last friday night a little later on-when we were there- there was live music
We stayed on well after dinner and went to the bar where we sampled the sangria's made by the cuuuute brazillian bartender! We will return!
When Fanny opened I was very overwhelmed by the dcor, it seemed a little too much for Graham avenue, didnt really want to see my cozy Italian neighborhood becoming as trendy and crowded as Bedford avenue
But they got me
The food is great, home cooking, tasty and not pricy
But most of all, its very comfortable, it gets sometimes packed on the wee-end but its still very welcoming, they do their best to seat you fast or you can hang at the bar, no liquor yet but very soon
They are French but not snob, it seems theyve been here forever, they totally feet and I love it
Long life to you
A friend recently took me to Fanny for a late dinner--it was great! The food is basically French with some interesting variations
I've never had better grilled calamari, and the oxtail was also the best I've ever had
All of the appetizers and entrees we ordered were really good, and our waitress was very attentive
They're still waiting on their liquor license, but if you bring a bottle of wine (we brought whiskey, which was perfect), you're all set
In fact, there's a liquor store 2-3 blocks south of Fanny on Graham
The decor is also on point
The lighting was subdued but not dark, the design is simple and clever
This place definitely rivals a lot of Manhattan (and other Billyburg) restaurants
When you're sick of Diner and Relish, just go a few stops further on the L!
How nice it would be if the smoked duck (appetizer) would come from poultry and not from pork,and if the microwave would heat up the ordered food totally and not only partialy
The interior decor is nice, the menu is simple,avarage
Desserts are higher quality than the rest of food
How did they get such high style in such an ugly neighborhood? Well, I guess thats Williamsburg
The food here is always great too
We were supprised to find so few tables full this Sunday at brunch
Maybe people don't know it is also a great spot for brunch
? well now you know, it was terrific standard french brunch items done well
I won't mind waiting for a table next time I want brunch here
good luck to em'
menu too limited
burgers, roasted chicken, nothing really jumped out at us
but the duck breast special was great, cooked rare
the best mussels-and-fries deal in the area, even better than at Fada
only one salad on the menu, boring lettuce deal
both servers (the owners?) seem inexperienced
the woman seemed totally bored
they ought to spend a little more energy getting you excited about the food
every time the door opened, the place lost half of its heat, which made for cold food
the front door also made a horrible scraping sound
the design is slate and wood, modern, angular, dark
needs a little work, but they'll succeed, especially in this restaruant-poor part of williamsburg
The owners take care great care in running this wonderful place
They manage to deliver consistently great food
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu
French bistro food never tasted so good and modern in Williamsburg
Fanny is the perfect neighborhood joint that you've been dreaming of
This small restaurant boasts a very tasteful and sophisticated interior yet it also has a very cozy and comfortable atmosphere where the food is served by its friendly owner and staff
The menu is a fusion of southern french home cooking with spanish cuisine
The food there is lighter, fresher and healthier than your average french bistro but can veer to the exotic for those unfamiliar with the regional cooking
For the moment it's BYOB since they are waiting for their liquor license
It's a great place to have dinner with friends over a bottle of wine
If you prefer to bring your own vintage, this is the time to go to Fanny
In the last couple months I've become a local fixture and somehow the menu stays interesting
The fare is humble, hearty and down home with a kind of European flair
It's definitely a Williamsburg cafe
You might think you're walking into a storage space or a dive until you make it inside to find a spectacular antiqued atmosphere
Roebling is a great place to have dinner on the cooshy couches with a big group of friends or sit at the bar and strike up a conversation with a total stranger
It's quiet during the week and you'll see a lot of williamsburg types working on their computers during the day, but there's often some kind of live music or movies on the weekend and some nights
This is a beautiful cafe/wine bar situated in what appears to be a converted factory
The decor and ambience is great for a nice conversation with friends over a bottle of wine or beer, without the hustle or noise of traditional bars
That said, this is NOT a restaurant, and one shouldn't expect to have a delicious meal here
I went with several friends and we were all underwhelmed by the taste and prices of the courses we ordered from the *extremely* limited menu
All in all, this is a great place for a coffee or drink, but not for a meal
This Tea room/cafe has great ambiance with sofas and an outdoor area
The food is tasty american fare and very affordable
They have an extensive tea offering but I am not a big tea fan
The service is ok since it is new and the staff didn't know the food items too well
But everyone were very nice
On one of the occasions that my friends and I were there for dinner, they ran out of the wine we ordered and they gave us each a free glass of another wine that was amazing
We would not have know the difference since we ordered the first wine from the discription rather than experience
The food went well with the wine but option was limited as it seemed to have been from a lunch menu
But I am sure with time, this place will be rockin! Love the comfy atmosphere
I LOVED this place! I have been twice and plan on goign back many times! And I don't even live in the area
The food is good-went there for brunch the first time which had some different items from the usual norm brunch good
Second time, I went there for dinner and had one of their specials-meat loaf
The proportions are always a good size and the wait staff was very attentive and poilte
Highly recommended!
Great job for such a new place

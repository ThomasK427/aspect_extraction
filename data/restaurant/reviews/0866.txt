The menu is very well thought out, and will not overwhelm you with choices
The chef has created the perfect combination of appetizers, entrees, and desserts to please all
8 of us sampled most everything on the menu, and from the octopus carpaccio to the roast suckling pig - served table-side - our experience will not soon be forgotten
Thank you, A

twice now, once for paella and another for the veal and lamb
both times we were treated well and were not rushed when we were there past the close of the kithen, on a sunday night! the place is perfect for a date, and the mixture of long and votive candles as well as a dimly bonze-lit hued bar gives the experience of being without electricty
forcing you to lean closer and inspect the delicious (and the spaniard bf should know) paella and enjoy your company
AOC Bedford is romatic, charming and a great date place, but only if you have an unlimited budget
The food is good but it is expensive, especially for the location and service
Service is very frenetic; one waiter is taking your order, another is serving your food, another is asking how your meal is
who are all these people and where are they when you need them? Based on the tight quarters, the winter will be a real challenge when they need to handle the overflow
Went to AOC Bedford for the first time last night, had a great meal all around
the tartagliatele was an incredible (and huge) appetizer, pasta tasted very fresh, and the salt cod main course was cooked just right
cute place, a little loud but overall great atmosphere, waitress was the perfect amount of attentive without being too much in our way
definitely recommend it for a date!

, for Appelation of Control, has certainly carried out the philosophy behind its inception---to provide only the highest quality products and service in order to bring to its customers nothing short of excellence in their dining experience
From their breads, to the butter and olive oil, salt and pepper, to their selection of wines and liquor, including the cognac used in cooking their crepes tangerine (I'm sure they call this dessert by its authentic name), one can expect only the best available ingredients possible
In addition, guests are served by the most attentive staff, who will proudly explain their restaurant's philosophy, in the hope that an appreciation for quality will make the patron's dining experience worthy of its own appellation

is among the best newcomers in NYC and will CERTAINLY be ranked among the best within a short period of time!
terrible service not authentic moroccan food, not tasty, I tried it because I love moroccan food, but I'am not coiming back crown is like tagine : they claim to have moroccan fod, but it's not ! go elsewhere ! try cafe mogador or zerza the food is much better there, particularly at zerza where the food is so delicious
This place just opened and it's definitely been found already
The wait wasn't too long, and the restaurant is very cute
It's obviously Moroccan but isn't overkill
The Kefta were great as was the Village Platter appetizer
No room for dessert - maybe next time
The wait staff took forever to take our order and forever to take our money
This is a small quaint little place
The portions are small by my husbands standards and wonderful for my standards
The dishes were nice Pad Thai w/shrimp, chicken satay
Tim Yum goong soup, SeaFood Gra Tieam
They seem to have a nice flow of business on the weekends
Nice little place and the food is nice
The food at Sabor is simply amazing
While the main dining room is on the small side, you won't notice as the Mojitos start coming
(FYI-The mojitos are the best in Bergen and Hudson County
Reservations are a must b/c if not you'll be waiting at the bar forever
We had steak and chicken left over and enjoyed sandwiches the next day
Hubby I will definitely be back for the Peruvian Chicken Churrasco
Even on weeknights, the crowd is strong, as this is the most stylish, flavorful spot this side of the Hudson
The decor, the food, the people
EVERYTHING about this place is great (except the microscopic parking lot and the parking attendants' inability to avoid tapping your car as they park it
)
this restaurant was CRAP
the food was CRAP
the service was CRAP
and to make it worse, it wasn't even cheap CRAP! we ordered tom yum soup, which tasted like water with hot sauce, pineapple fried rice which tasted like cheap yeung chow fried rice with some canned pineapple tossed in
the service was even worse than the food
the server had some serious passive aggressive attitude, and she followed through by bringing food to tables that sat down and ordered after us before us
topping off the crap food and service was upmarket pricing
worst thai ever
i make the trek out to brooklyn to go to joya now whenever i want thai food
this is the best mexican in the area by far! make sure you get the at the table guacamole
its to die for!!
I go to Charrito's at least twice a month - you can always count on the awesome Mexican food and sangria (bring your own wine)
My favorite is the Rey Burro but the fajitas and dou de enchiladas are also delicious
I've brought many out of town guests here and everyone loves it
Cheap food and plenty of it!! Bring beer or wine and not liquor because to be honest the magaritas they make are pretty poor
Bring your own bottle of tequila and they'll make you a pitcher of margaritas
only problem is that our pitcher mysteriously had NONE of the tequila we bought in there
My boyfriend and I ate there this weekend and, from that one pitcher, each got about 4 large margaritas
I'm not much of a drinker, and after 2 large margaritas didn't feel a thing
Neither did he
They couldn't have put any of our tequila in there, so who knows where it ended up
beware
The food is way overpriced, especially for a Mexican place
We also got charged for the chips and salsa they brought out before our food came (we never asked for them, but assumed they were free)
What a ripoff
We will never go here again
This is truly one of the best restaurants I've ever been to
The Scallop aptizer is to die for
Keep in mind you are going to open up your wallet here but if your willing to pay for great food and a great expierence this is your place
The entertainment is wonderful just remember they add $15 or so per person to your check
Well worth it when you realize there are about 20 people entertaining you with music and dancing
When your debating on where to go for a special occasion skip the city and come here
If you're looking for great food and excellent service this is your place
We lived in Manhattan for 6 years and recently relocated to Montclair and we were searching for an upscale place for special occasions
This is it
Danny our waiter for all 3 visits remembered our drinks and our names on our second visit
The music (11 piece orchestra) and entertainment is truly an expierence on Thurs-Sat nights
All of the food is very well prepared and you will not be disappointed
If your lucky you will be seated near one of the soprano's or someone who looks like they belong on the show
Bring your wallet and enjoy
I've never had a worse dining experience! Signs of foreboding disappointment abounded from the moment we were seated
Both tables on either side of ours were confused, shocked, then disgruntled
We, however, didn't heed the signs and stayed anyway
Evn though, we overheard their complaints of watered down espresso and a surprise split charge for a dessert that was shared, not technically split
We made note not to make those mistakes
Didn't matter, though, because we weren't exempt
My husband and I ordered appetizers (3), a rabbit dish (for him) and the hangar steak (for me)

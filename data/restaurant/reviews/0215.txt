Our waiter was horrible; so rude and disinterested
He seemed like everyone around him was a nuisance to his existence
The sangria's - watered down
menu - uneventful, small
the food - not worth the price
went to sala recently to celebrate a friend's birthday
we were a group of eight and even though not everyone arrived on time, the servers were very accommodating and allowed us to reserve our table until everyone arrived
the food is tasty, although the choices are somewhat limited, and the setting is very warm and cozy, similar to rustic, spanish villa
It is an excellent spot to throw a going away party!!!! Pizer
Lata!
wonderful tapas and pinchos
the dates were excellent
and great sangria, although the pitcher was on the small side
went with a group of 10 on a friday, had no problems
wonderful service
can't wait to go back!
I absolutely love this place
we went here for drinks one night and then came back for dinner on a Tuesday
Service was absolutely incredible, our server was warm and helpful, prompt and appeared at just the right times
We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was yes, expensive at $24, but well worth it
We then ordered an eggplant appetizer and fried goat cheese (13) which were both delicious but small
For entrees we got the pork, which was superb- sweet, with pears and homemade crispy potatoes- large enough that I couldnt' finish it all
The whole experience was incredible- the atmosphere makes you feel like you are sitting outdoors in a Spanish village
I highly recommend this place for a date
I recently visited Sala for the first time for a good friend's birthday shindig
Liking, but not loving tapas that I had had in the past in Spain, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy every dish at Sala
Unlike some tapas, theirs were all bursting with flavor and were very varied in makeup
To top it off, the service was excellent
I will definitely return
Food was amazing and the ambiance and service complemented the experience so well
Highly recommend ordering the dates and/or the fried goat cheese
The place was unpretentious yet the scene was so 'happening'
We left at 11pm and the place was still packed with customers
A truly NY experience!
I thought this place was great
The tapas were very tasty-- I recommend the dates wrapped with bacon
It's unbelievably good
I also thought the sangria was the best I have had so far in the city
I thought the service was good-the manager was very accomadating
The atmosphere was great
I will be going back
I visited Sala with a group of friends for a going away party and we all had a wonderful time
We reserved the downstair lounge for private parties and the price was fairly reasonable
The food was great and plentiful
The service was excellent
I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking to throw a fun lively private party for a reasonable price
I expected there to be more options for tapas the food was mediocre but the service was pretty good
Went with about 8 friends and we were seated in the corner so we wouldn't be disturbed
Food was good
If you order cheese, they give you a lb
If you order sausage, they give you a pig
The drift is, they give you huge homogenous portions that make you a little annoyed with your order
A little on the noisy side, but enough to have table conversations
Okay if I'm in the neighborhood and want tapas
Sangria was GREAT! Value was 'eh'
Service was good!
I have never had more expensive food with such horrible service
The waiter was very rude when cleaning the table and dropped utensils all over me, staining my clothing! I will never go back because the food is not all that, and the service was horrendous! Not worth my money! Even Peter Luger has better service than this place!
Went there last night
The food was great but the music was loud and hip-hop and the wait was ridiculous and the prices were out of this world
But I will still go back for the pinchos
Unless you like getting forced out the door before your check hits the table, I would stay far away from this place
Went with friends for dinner, and spent quite a bit-multiple courses, rounds of drinks, and desserts
Still not enough to be respected by the staff or managers
Other reviews are here from people with similar experiences
The people running this place need to learn to respect their customers, because there are plenty of other fine restaurants in the city that do
Slow service, the waiter didn't seem to care at all
took us 20 min b4 he came over to ask us what we wanted
Ham coquette, duck over toast, pork loin over toast were good
Main courses-pork chop with potato chips and lamb shank weren't so good
i suggest ordering only tapas and sagria and skip on main dishes
Been to many tapas restaurants, but this one has the best variety and flavor of any tapas restaurant I have been to in the States
Even rivals some of my favorites in Spain
The Sangria is a must have
Don't miss this one
I recently went to Sala for my birthday dinner with a party of six
We all agreed that the sangria was very good (increase the size of the pitchers!)
The rustic feel of the restaurant coupled with the hint of latin music were the perfect combination for a relaxed setting
The menu was limited but the selections were very good
Desert was a treat
Try the flan! Service was very informative and prompt
Overall, Sala provides a the essential ingredients for a lovely evening replete with good food and good times!
What a find! I went with two of my friends and we had the best time there
The ambience is very nice
The service was awesome
The food was delicious
If you like tapas
this is the place to go
I didn't eat, so I can't comment on the food
But they do have the BEST sangria I've ever had
Downstairs dance floor was a joke
way too small, way too crowded, music was so-so - mostly hip-hop but a lot of what you can hear on the radio
The owner of Sala needs to decide: do I run a bar that serves tapas or a tapas restaurant with a bar area? On a recent visit, the so-called restaurant was overrun with smokers (Mayor Bloomberg should have this place on his list as soon as the smoking ban takes effect at the end of the month)
There is no delineation between the restaurant and the bar
I was seated at the table closest to the bar, so I spent the entire evening surrounded by overflow from the bar (who for some inexplicable reason refused to sit or stand in the part of the bar farthest from the restaurant, which was uncrowded and had seating available)
It's really too bad
Great space, good food, accommodating service should add up to a good time, but I felt as if in the middle of a fraternity party during my last visit
Went to Sala for a birthday dinner - it was perfect for a group dinner
The atmosphere was nice and cozy
The sangria was delicious and the food was great, there was something for everyone

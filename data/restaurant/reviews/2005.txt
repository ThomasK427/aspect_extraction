My friend and I went out for an afterwork relax 'n catch-up session
We certainly stopped by the right place
The bread really IS to-die-for
I swear I'm going to try it at home
As the previous reviewer said, the food is basic (I had the lobster ravioli), but still a treat
There seemed to be a lot of fun going on inside with the karoake session
I'm going to try it next time
this restaurant was the very first Italion eatery that served a blue crab pasta sauce
When I saw it on the menu I didn't beleive it and was not expecting the real thing
This was the real thing
Salute' to Angelo and staff
Great place
An experienced waiter/waitress can usually read a good order/good tip, bad order/bad tip
You get what you deserve
Our original party of 7 became a party of 9 with two people coming late
They actually saved a table for them while the resturant was quickly filling up
Portions were generous and food was excellent!
Reservations are pointless at this place
The staff is incredibly rude and we waited well over an hour, despite our reservation, only to sit in an overcrowded and loud dining room and eat average italian food
If you want good italian there are plenty of other places in Little Italy where the food is fabulous and they treat guests like guests even if you aren't a 'friend of the family', if you know what I mean
I have been to Angelo's several times and was always very satisfied! I love the food and the entire place is very romantic
This is a grat spot to bring a date
I have never been there during prime dinner hours like Friday or Saturday night though
Im usually there late afternoon and I have had no problems with a long wait
If you love Italian food and want a little romance, then Angelo's is the place to be!
After calling a week in advance for a reservation for 3, we were told when we arrived that we did not make that reservation because they don't take reservations for 2 or 3 on a weekend
then waited with 20 other people (who all had reservations) outside while groups of obvious acquaintances of the owner, host, or waiter were taken right in with zero reservations
When the host/greeter got sick of all the upset people asking why their reservations were not being honored, he just left and went to the bar to hang out the buddies he had let in
We didn't eat there, but the place is shabby, the owner who was present was an ass as was the host and a waiter working the front
It was a nightmare
Don't waste your time waiting a hour or better to be abused by these flakes
angelos is great! yes the wait may be a pain and it does help to be a regular but its def worth the wait
ive been going there for years and it hasnt failed me yet
if your a first timer get the stuffed veal chop (its off the charts) they do one of the best lobsters ive had and if those dont suit you you really cant go wrong with anything they have
good wine selection not much variety but it has the classics that are worth drinking
its perfect to any occasion business ,family,friends it dont matter
try to make friends with your waiter and stick with him everytime and you wont ever wait in line again
Huge portions, authentic Italian cuisine, cooked quickly
I suggest checking this place out during the day or very early evening
It gets crowded fast!
I hadn't been to Angelo's in nearly a year and was so pleased to remember how fantastic the food is! The waiters are knowledgeable - and straight from Italy! The spedini is the best I've ever had and their pastas were absolutely delicious
I had simply forgotten how good it is and thought I should write about my experience!
Angelo's food is the cream of the crop in Little Italy
The service can be harried and hurried, the wait, even w/ a resvn, is omnipresent, you certainly won't be in a trendy environment, but from the top to the bottom of the menu, the food is great
Furthermore, the menu is extensive enough to accomodate vegetarians, so everyone can be happy
I went here on Valentines Day with my boyfriend and we had the most incredible time
The place was perfect
We did have to wait about 40 min (even with reservations) but it was well worth the wait
The food was delicious
Real Italian food
And the service was impeccable
Everyone was so nice and helpful, they didn't rush us at all
We had such a great time can't wait to go back!!
The food at this Little Italy restaurant was very good
I have never been to Little Italy before and was quite impressed
The service was incredible, and the waiter even referred to my brothers fiance as bella
I assumed this meant he was trying to give her a jump so I switched into attack mode, however, my brother informed me that was the custom in Italy
Chalk it up to ignorance I guess
The appetizers were done well, the dinner portions good and the I did not have desserts so I choose not to comment
The wine was excellent
Great romantic spot for a date, although you may end up leaving without the girl because of the super suave waiters
Ambiance and area very nice
Prices are alittle high, as I didnt feel like I got all that much bang for my buck
All in all give Angelos a shot
PEOPLE WHO KNOW GREAT ITALIAN FOOD GO TO ANGELOS, YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO GO, LIKE IN THE AFTERNOON, AVOID THE CROWDS
IF YOU GO ON SATURDAY NIGHT EXPECT TO WAIT! BUT IT IS BY FAR THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN NYC NO QUESTIONS ASKED!! REAL ITALIANS WILL EAT THERE OFTEN
AFTER YOU TRY IT YOU WILL SEE WHY ITS ALWAYS PACKED
ITS WORTH THE WAIT!!!
I absolutely loved it
The food was wonderful and the service was great
It reminded me of my grandmother's cooking
The entire staff treating us like gold
I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Italian food
It's worth every hard-earned penny
the food was pretty good and our waiter was so nice and knowledgable
He catered to our every whim, even though there were times where he disappeared
ON the other hand, the food was a little expensive but worth it in a way
We waited over an hour for a table
Then 2 couples who came after us were seated before us
It was crowded and noisy
The service was the ABSOLUTE WORST service that I've ever had in my life
The prices were ridiculous
The food was very good but portions were small
I cannot emphasize enough that the service was awful
I do not reccommend going here
A friend told us to try Angelo's when we were in New York and we're glad he did
It was the best meal we had while in the city
Food, service, atmosphere
all great
Our waiter, Ralph, was adorable
He made our night
At the age of 15 my Dad starting taking me to Angelo's, always just the two of us, it was a special thing between father and daughter
My Dad was born in the old country in Avelino, worked as teamster local 478 much of his life
He took me to Angelo's twice a year from 15 till I was 22
I remember walking in and the Maitre D
saying Louie come sta, shaking his hand and seating us
I remember the older guys sitting at the bar, my Dad would smoke a cigar w\them
Dad past away when I was 23 and for the 1st time in 9 yrs
on My 31, 2003 I returned to Angelo's with someone very special but it was nothing like I had remembered, lights glaring, no old world charm, poor service
I was deeply sadened\displeased with the service, not what I remember at all

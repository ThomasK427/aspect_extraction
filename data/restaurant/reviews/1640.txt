The food was okay
I could name ten places off the top of my head I'd rather go to and spent the same amount of money for dinner
Atmosphere was average and could use some updating
Service was average, but our waiter was full of tude
I had the best lunch ever
Gotham is truly a place to dine at least once
The layout and decor are great
The staff is truly wonderful and classy
we didnt have to want for anything
our waiter was so friendly and made you feel at home
Food, 5 stars, filet migon
One of the best
But i say the chocolate cake, it was like great sex
Gotham's food is fabulous, 98% of the time
I've been there on numerous occasions and with the exception of a recent disappointment (ordered the duck and the dish came cold to the table, so I had to send it back), the food is always excellent
The service is efficient, but mechanical
There is not an ounce of warmth or sincerity in the wait staff
They are simply doing their job, which five years ago would have been just fine
But dining today is a multi-sensorial experience and the staff's attitude plays a huge part in that
They should try to smile every so often and mean it
2 part review
Food was off the charts
Loved it all
4 of us went for dinner on a Tuesday
seafood, steak, dessert all wonderful in presentation and taste
Go for the food!! The wine guy was horrible
He talked down to us, when we could even get his attention
Felt like a beggar on 5th Ave talking to him
Have a drink or soda and stay away from the wine!
After doing hours of searching for the perfect place to take my mom to dinner for her birthday I finally discovered Gotham
It was exactly what I was looking for; gourmet, seafood, excellent presentation, enormous wine list, beautiful setting
We opted to do the three course option and were not disappointed
The miso black cod and rack of lamb were the hits of the table
The one drawback was the service-while professional and precise, our waitress was not friendly by any stretch of the imagination
She was as rigid and cold as a frozen turkey
I would have to agree with previous reviews regarding the aloof staff
The food and presentation were extraordinary, but the greeting I received at the door was a step or two just below a sneer
I was with a business group and well dressed, so Im not sure what prompted the response
When reminded of a drink order that had not been received, our waiter felt it necessary to claim that the drink was not ordered and that is why he didnt bring it, not that he had forgotten
With the amount of money that was put down for that meal, I expect EVERYTHING to be outstanding, including the service
So, even though what we were served was beyond perfect, I probably wouldnt return because of staff
Great food is not that hard to find
Truly a special place-food great-service excellent-made you feel special
A real treat
My favorite will have to be the seared foie gras the grilled lamb! The foie gras would transport you with it's flavors and it was simply divine, the grilled lamb was perfectly tasty, not overcooked, and the seasoned herbs were really mouth watering, and I can't wait to return for another occassion! The desserts I loved was the creme brulee of caramel or chocolate dipped with the churros, as well as the delicious strawberry souffle! I loved the presentation, the service, and most importantly the food, we were never rushed, we had the nicest table, and we enjoyed the whole experience!
My girlfriend and I ate at Gotham bar and grill last night, and our experience was amazing
Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection, and was presented perfectly
The asparagus mushroom risotto, seared tuna, and lobster tail were the best we ever had
Then the desserts came, and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had
The cinnamon rolls melted in our mouths, and the chocolate cheese cake did as well
Our waiter took exceptional care of us and paid proper attention to us
I will sum it up with, it was worth every penny!
Gotham has been my cafeteria for over 5 years
The food are always great and nicely prepared
Although the place is a bit overcrowded, waiters are always polite and professional
The newpaper reviews in the window are from 7 yrs ago! The service was helpful, but aloof
The dinner dining had mixed reviews by my party
I ordered the seared tuna- give it a 8
5 out of 10
The organic free range chicken was a 6, the lamb chop was excellent, and we had to send the halibut back 2x with no result- ended up having to order anther dish (cod) in which the fish was good but the clams were too tough to eat and the sausage wasn't even finished cooking (thus could not be consumed)
Save your money and eat somewhere else
I really cannot believe all of these negative reviews on Gotham! My husband and I are hardcore traveling foodies
I think I have been to all of the restaurants in NY ranked 20 or above on Zagats, in addition to as many Michelin-starred restaurants as we can manage on vacations
Without a doubt, Gotham is our favorite restaurant in New York
The food there is always polished, but really tasty
It's a beautiful space
The crowd is not young, but hey, go somewhere else to get a drink afterward
The highlight here is definitely the food
I have loved the seared tuna there
I have had an incredible duck risotto there (with cabbage), sweet shrimp risotto, filet
Gotham is awesome- so much better than Jean Georges (where I found my food inedible), or Union Square Cafe, or so many other hyped restaurants in NY
The rack of lambs are to die for, the service is great, the ambiance is perfect
I took my cousins here and they were completely smitten
This is one of my favorite places to have lunch and dinner
I sometimes come here with my friends after work
I had a wondeful time at Gotham bar and grill
We had their filet mignon and lobster pasta
Both were delicious
However, even though i understand its a service thing, or perhaps we were there when it wasn't too busy, but i felt like i needed some personal space
The waiters were staring at our table the whole time
It is very pricey though, and the portions are small, so you will be hungry!
That place is overpriced for what you get in your plate
If you are hungry don't go there
I don't eat fish and I wanted just pasta
The PASTA of the DAY was linguini with lobster sauce and I didn't want that
The waitress said I can't have any substitutions, which was absurd
If you are going to an expensive restaurant the least they can do is work with you
I got the VEGETARIAN meal
When the dish came I thought it was a joke
There was 3 baby carrots, a spoon full of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, 3 pieces of eggplant, and 10 string beans, oh and onions
That was it
No Rice,No Pasta NOTHING
I had to go home and eat
Maybe I'm not classy but when I go out to eat that's exactly what I want to do EAT
I will never go back there again
The food, waitstaff etc are wondreful
but the greeting at the door is so rude, that it puts a damper on the entire meal
everytime I go to Gothan, I am treated like road kill by the dragons at the door
Steel yourself to an unpleasant entrance to get to the wonders that await
Gotham has good food that is displayed elegantly (can you say Leaning Tower of Pisa made of lobster?) Our waitress was almost snotty and was sometimes difficult to find

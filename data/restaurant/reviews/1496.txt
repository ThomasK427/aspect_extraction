Great job, thank you- Jerry Linda
Good food, spectacular drinks, fun crowd
I could not have had a better experience and cannot say enough positive things! Would recommend to anyone looking for a great night out, and definitely advocate taking Choice up on it's outstanding happy hour
Tried this new place on Friday night and we weren't disappointed
The drinks were excellent, the food was delicious and the waitstaff was so nice
I can't wait to go back
In a neighborhood that doesn't really have too many places, besides a diner, where you can just go and get a burger or some grilled fish this is definitely a welcomed addition to 3rd Avenue
My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick dinner and decided to check out Choice Kitchen Cocktails
My salad was perfect! Lots of yummy veggies and the portions were huge
My boyfriend thought that these were the best boneless chicken wings and nachos he had ever had! The restaurant had a great vibe - super sleek but yet really relaxed
So going back!
I typically hang out in the East Village or LES and decided to meet a few friends for drinks at Choice before going out
We wound up having such a great time that we stayed the night! The drinks
the food
the people
such fun! Happy that I can now save money on cab fare not having to travel all the way downtown
Well done!
I was having a corporate gathering at my apartment and took a chance on ordering delivery and was i pleased
The food was just as good as eating at the restaurant
Although you cant have martinis delivered
Just another great aspect of this homerun of a restaurant
My girlfriend and I came here on a Saturday Night as we were looking for a place in the area to eat
It features a long front bar and seating for about 40-50 people in the back
We came in at 9 p
m
and the dinner area got more crowded as the night went along
The food here is very good (I had the chicken, she had the steak salad) and reasonably priced
However, the service wasn't the best
Our appetizers came out the same time as our entree and our waitress disappeared quite frequently
Beer is reasonably priced (a pint of Coors Light was $5
00)
We would probably go back because of the food although if the service remained the same, that might be our last visit
We went to brunch at Choice this past Sunday and really enjoyed everything
We sat outside and enjoyed a great afternoon
The outside is a little cramped but I guess that's NYC
The food was first rate with a nice selection of omelets, traditional dishes, and some tasty unique entrees (banana stuffed croissant is amazing!)
It thought it was also reasonable, includes 2 drinks w/ alcohol
There has been a buzz about this place since opening and I can see why
Very well run, excellent food, and an overall great experience
Our waitress, Carra, and manager Cindy were great
Welcome to the neighborhood, sorely needed!
I live across the street next to the Rodeo Bar
My husband and I stopped by Choice on Tuesday evening and were pleasantly surprised
It really is a beautiful place and the staff was great
Very nice crowd, a break from the bt bars in the 30s
They need to make sure that people know how big the place is and about the huge dining room, from the street you don't get the full atmosphere of the place
We both had drinks and entrees
Food was flawless and probably the best in the area
Nice assortment and variety, I had the potato cod, Jerry the duck breast
Both were great
It was also difficult to find the bathrooms (downstairs), need more signs
Overall a great experience and a welcome to the neighborhood
We will be back

Prior to Choice opening, there were limited places for a nice meal, no ear piercing music and a good time
I quickly grew tired of the fondue place and the cafe bar, nice but boring and the food was miserable
My co-workers and I went to Choice on Wednesday for their martini night
Katie Rich (the managers) were great to my group
The appetizers are delicious! goat cheese tapas, Asian dumplings, Brazilian skewers, lemon shrimp and baby back ribs! The martini selection was FUN! We tried all of them
On the receipt it asked to review the place on Citysearch, and I am doing just that
Beautiful place, great staff, no attitude, fun tunes, and an amazing menu (a true gem)Thanks for a great night out, you have a beautiful place, great staff and really know what you are doing! - Thanks Jenny Mutual of America Group
Apparently, Choice opened this last week
I went to Choice this past Friday for dinner with friends
It is the same owner as the Uptown Restaurant (which I frequent alot)
As a resident in the neighborhood, It is a HUGE asset to have a nice classy place like this in the area
I am sooo sick of the run of the mill frat bars and higher end Park Avenue fare at crazy prices and so-so fare
The food is superb and very reasonably priced
Great selections of boutique wines (loved the Oregon Hahn PN), martini's, and specialty drinks
The space is beautifully designed, very high end but comfortable
Exposed brick, fireplace, very open and an alive vibe
For a first time visit, I was very impressed and you will see us again
Best of luck and keep it nice!
Was @ Choice for it's opening night, and was not impressed AT ALL
Yes, the decor is trendy, warm, and inviting, however the scence does not override everything else that sucked
The seating arrangements were too tight and cramped
The waitress was not only slow, but screwed up our order (5 appetizers only) by forgetting one of our appetizers and the condiments for the nachos, as well as overcharging on the bill
Food presentation was sub-par (I've seen better plates at TGI Fridays), taste was bland, and I was so ready to leave once the meal was over
The menu is pretty extensive though
Overall, it's not worth it
Choice restaurant was the ideal place for me and my friends to gather after work
The service was attentive and friendly, the drinks were amazing, and the food was superb
The entire feel of the restaurant made me feel like I was a regular patron
It is a great place to meet for dinner, drinks, or to watch a game at the bar
I went there with a few business associates the other night for dinner and drinks
We all had a great time
This place is amazing
There is nothing like it in the area
The food was top notch
I don't know where they got the chef from, but this isn't anything like what I expected
I will go back 110%
Its a great place to kick back and hang out with either business or friends or even a date
The decor is nice, the staff and service was also top notch
I have no problem recommending this place to anyone
This place is amazing
All around I was very impressed with my first visit to Aoki
Everything from the ambiance to the wait staff and most important the food was first rate
Everything was done to perfection
The Chilian sea Bass and tuna steak was out of this world
The Salmon tartar and tuna carparcio was worth going back for more! Amazing sushi
excellent roll and well prepared

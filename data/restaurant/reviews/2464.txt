COMPLETELY OVERRATED
i would rate the service as horrendous, but we never received any
the servers ignored us as we sat there for 30 minutes
when we finally decided to leave and ordered our desserts to go, the server asked us to check the display case to see if our dessert choices were still available
HELLO? wasn't that her job?? despite the cute decor, lalo is not worth the hassle or the attitude
there are many better dessert places in the city
i'd rather wait in line for emack bolio's any night
All those dreams of pastries and chocolate and fruit come to life! Lalos packs a lot of variety into a small and very charming space
Exotic coffee drinks, brunch and lunch items from a solid if a little limited menu, beer, wine, liquor - Lalos can satisfy your craving for delish
After going to this cafe 4 years ago and being impressed with the experience, I decided to try my luck at this eatery again
Unfortunately, the experience I had a couple of evenings ago was vastly different from my memory of the past
Upon entering the atmosphere, my family was herded to an undersized table with little room to spare
Those waiting inside to get a free table and waitresses carlessly walking by only served to make matters worse
The sounds inside were loud and hurtful, with the air shaken by African drum sounds and patrons' noisy talk; not what you would expect from a cafe serving European desserts! The food was up to my expectations, but the surroundings prevented me from receiving any enjoyment during the evening
Eat here only when a semblance of order comes to fruition! For now, try your luck at Cafe Mozart instead!
Lalo is always booming and serving scrumptious desserts! Expect long waits on weekends that are well worth the time spent smushed up against the dessert counter
Have been here numerous times, and have decided that the Mint Tart is the best choice!
There are not a lot of good places to take a teetotalling friend or date, but Lalo has something for everyone and its impossible not to be tempted
Great for a laid-back, just-checking-it-out date
And it heats up naturally because they pack 'em in
I initially went there b'cos i knew that it was the cafe in the movie 'you've go mail'
but i've gone back thrice cos i loved the ambience and the food
I have to say that the service is TERRIBLE
but if you're not in a hurry, you could do worse than spend a couple of hours in there
it's a lovely atmosphere, especially late at night or on a lazy sunday afternoon
The desserts are to die for
and you have to try the cafe lalo supershake
Another thing
DONT go there if you're on a diet
Lastly, there a lot of stuff there for vegetarians
The desert selection is pretty awesome, but that doesn't necessarily mean the deserts actually are awesome
Maybe I just haven't had the right desert, but each time I go I am disappointed
Although it's crowded (VERY crowded), I do like the atmosphere though, and they have pretty good smoothies there (best I've had in Manhattan at least)
They seem like they're always buzzing at night
The food was great, but the service was maybe the worst I've had in NYC - and I'm not picky about service
The waitress could not have appeared any less interested - she just stared off into space and barely listened while we ordered
Took 15 minutes to bring water, another 15 for the dessert menu, another 15 to bring the check
We thought maybe she was busy, but she was just standing around at the bar with the other hooch waitresses
I don't know if they purposely train the waitstaff to be 'stylishly zoned out' or something, but it's a real turnoff
Cafe Lalo has got the best variety of desserts
something for everyone in your group
but the seating is crowded and like other's here have said
it is a bit loud inside
In Short The flagstone floors and marble-topped tables are atmospheric enough, but fun-for-kids faux-Gothic touches like "decaying" stone walls and a "crumbling" ceiling are a bit preposterous
The crowd, a cross-section of Upper West Siders, is made up of couples, solo intellectuals, and families with kids
Enormous salads and a few pizzas and sandwiches make up the menu; but a bigger draw is the coffee, served 20 different ways, and the wealth of dessert choices: chocolate cheesecakes, bombes, mousses, and fruit pies
You walk in to see a huge assortment of cakes and pies and cheesecakes - trust me - they're all good
The raspberry almond marzipan cake has huge pipings of actual marzipan (none of this almond essence nonsense) and a delicious custard with lots of raspberry
The Vesuvius cake I described to be made of babies, puppies, and rainbows because it honestly is just everything good in the world
With a smooth white chocolate, a light chocolate mousse, and a deep, dark, and extremely satisfyingly rich dark chocolate part, you can't go wrong
The blueberry vanilla tea was also very good - it tasted like a muffin almost
My most favorite dessert location
After watching a movie on a Thursday night, my wife and I decided to have some desserts at Edgars Caf
We were pleasantly seated by the wait staff at a table of our choice
The service was okay and they took our orders accordingly
The staff member even repeated our orders to make sure that she got it right
Although, the food was served in due time, they still brought me the wrong beverage! The cheesecake was average
The ambience and dcor of the place is okay
I think it is still a great place to talk with friends and family
My sister and I went here to try out their desserts
Our father is a baker and we have tried desserts from many bakeries cafes over the years, so we feel we are not newbies to judging the quality of a dessert
We were appalled when I was served a stale dessert and the manager tried to convince us that that's the way it's supposed to be
The cafe was also very crowded and they initially tried to get us to sit at a table for four that was occupied by two other people
Ive never been to a cafe/restaurant that tried so hard to pull the wool over our eyes
A cafe that tries to cut corners on service and quality like this is not recommended
I don't know what the big deal with this place is
The desserts are nothing but average and actually one of our cakes tasted stale
Our waitress was very unfriendly, but that could be only because she was the only one serving a full house
Overall I would probably give it another chance but only because of the convenience of the location
Edgar's cafe has been one of my favorite dessert cafes in New York City for years
The desserts are to die for and their salads are also very tasty- always fresh and the portions are very large
I've always found the service to be very quick and polite and the owner is a very sweet woman who greets me everytime I enter the place
--Did I mention the desserts are to die for?!
I've been reading the reviews of Edgar's Cafe, and I'm shocked to find such awful reviews of the service
While I would certainly not call the service 'friendly,' I have never had a rude run-in with the staff
However, I do wish that the waitstaff was more attentive in terms of getting the check faster and refilling water
The desserts are pretty good and my mocha was amazing
Definitely get some coffee to go with your pastry!
I stumbled upon Edgars on a rainy, cold saturday night
I had to wait online before getting inside, and was greeted with a big smile by the owner, whose name is Anna I was told
Anna cheerfully showed me my table
I had the salad with tuna, and white wine, a chocolate cake for desert with a delicious cafe mocha
It was great
I love the decor, the atmosphere, the feel of the place that comes from an attentive staff and an owner that obviously loves her cafe! I'll be back often
I live two blocks away from Edgars and will never go back again
During a recent lunch we ordered four entrees and three drinks
While we waited for our order, we took out some cards to play a game
In an extremely brusque and rude way, the owner/manager told us to stop playing
In a cafe, I can appreciate the need to prohibit people from lounging around all day, esp
if they have only ordered one coffee
In this instance, the request was unnecessarily rude
We mentioned this on our way out and the response was defiant and unapologetic
The owner said he couldn't force us to come back and I agree wholeheartedly, we will never patronize this cafe again
The service at Edgars has gone from good to being absolutely atrocious!! I have been a frequent visitor and enjoyed the famous Edgars Cheese Cake
After the latest incident of shocking service, I have vowed never to go back (no matter how good the cheese cake might be)
The owners of this establishment seems only interested in achieving as much turnover as possible, with a total disregard for service, friendliness, politeness and making one feel welcome
I refuse to support any conduct of this kind, especially when a Sunday afternoon coffee with friends turns into an affair, where one feels like the proverbial cattle herded to the end point which in this case happens to be the cash register
To Edgars Caf - I say good riddance!!
We had made a reservation for 10 for a weekday afternoon
They assured us there would be no problem

We really enjoyed our selves there is a tight squeeze at the tables, but the ambiance is very cozy, romantic
We will definitely go again, I hope things will only improve
I enjoyed the food very much we had big proportions
I recommend everyone to try the vanilla martini
Great ambience! great staff! good prices!
The only thing I recommend is make reservations on a busy night this is a small place
Fo a Sunday night, this restaurant was fairly busy
I'd recommend reservations if dining at a popular hour
Ambience was comfortable and romantic
The service was without any complaints
My waiter was extremely polite, courteous, and timely
The other customers were really great too
friendly atmosphere
The food was great
If you like soul food, this is the place to go! I had the blackened catfish, which wasn't too spicy (surprisingly), and my friend had the jerk snapper, which was, but in a good way! The candied yams were like dessert, which was a good thing because I couldn't eat another bite!!! It was around the corner from the Beacon theatre too
food is pretty decent, service is amiable if a bit scattered, and the vibe is chill
it's a good combination of neighborhood watering hole and semi-swank eatery
beware the fried appetizers (tasteless), but check out the sweet candied yams and mashed potatoes
The Shark Bar, a good place to go if your looking for great southern style cooking
Well, i heard about this resatauraunt from friends who have heard about it too, but they never went
so me and my girls all decided to go to see what it was like
The restauraunt is really nice, the atmosphere that is
The food thats a whole new story, i didnt like it, my friends werent too fond of it either
And when we got our bill, we were very disappointed also
200 dollars for bad food, and this was with 5 people, definitley not worth it!!! Go to TGIFridays or something
Great gathering place, drinks weren't the cheapest, but it was great to bring friends
Staff was considerate, and food was interesting
Portions were definately generous, but prices for the sort of food could have been cheaper
Overall: A-
The Shark Bar is a nice place to go with your boo
In the back are tables that have curtains you can pull for a little more privacy, the bread is good, the waiters are attentive, and the food is yummy
The only negative thing I have to say is the tables are too close together so you'd hear your neighbor's entire conversation
Other than that
it's all good!
This restaurant had wonderful soul food
The atmosphere is very romantic and the bar is nicely sized
The wait is long but it is worth it
I can't even recommend one type of food
they are all great
Keep going back to try everything on the menu
Very good looking people and you might be able to catch a celebrity or two sitting in a booth nearby
I am a regular member of this establishment
Just about all the staff knows this
I am a good tipper and I do this with them because they are accommodating and innovative with their meals
The staff makes you apart of their ambiuance
The food is really really really good
Do not leave until you have had the mac and cheese and strings beans as the side orders
The app's are delicious also
My standard meal there is app's: catfish strips, wings
Entree: fried catfish or the seafood combo or the specials
Ask the bartender they will give you in detail about the specials
It's a must go
I don't care what color you are
Don't be afraid because most of the people in there are Afro-American
Please come one come all
The atmosphere is so relaxing and down to earth
Please go!
After a long Memorial Day weekend, my Lady Friend and I decided to eat something that was not barbecued or fried
We decided on Italian food
Since my Lady Friend is Italian, her bar for her country's fare is high
However, she went patriotic with a salad and grilled chicken
I had the penne a la vodka
The best thing about Bello Giardino was the garden in the back
Covered by a canopy of vines and leaves, it didn't feel like NYC
I imagine that the staff was short because the service was a bit spotty but very friendly
I'd recommend this for a casual dinner, but make sure you sit in the garden
My girlfriend and I dine here on a regular basis
Our food has been consistently good, and we can always walk in and get a table
Prices are very reasonable
The bill for the two of us is usually around $60, including drinks, tip, etc
While the pasta dishes are good, I highly recommend a chicken or eggplant dish
This place can have a romantic feel to it when it isn't crowded, but when they are busy, the acoustics make it seem a bit noisy
Overall, I find it to be an enjoyable experience
went w/ several friends based on the previous reviews
unfortunately it seems the restaurant must be under new ( disimproved) management
food was mediocre (bland served luke warm) service was inconsistent (attentive @ first and then nothing near the end)
but the worst part was dealing with the rude manager
our party would have left were it not for the fact we were there for a bday celebration
suffice it to say we will not go back nor ever recommend the place to anyone unless we happen to hear there is new management
DO NOT GO HERE! In my 4 years of dining out in ny, this was the worst
the place was cute enough, but it was prob the worst italian i have had in ny
(vodka sauce tasted like powdered milk chicken was dry, appetizer portion was way too small) but worst of all, the manager was so rude and confrontational
despite the fact that everyone had ordered, he tried to make us order more food wine
if i were the owner, i would first fire the manager/bartender
Once the service improves, i would fire the chef
What can i say? It was a great place
Some friends and I, all college students, decided to go there for a friends birthday, expecting an okay place in the two-$$ range on city search
Wow, were we suprised!! The food was great, the wine list was, well, better than we expected
Granted, it was a thursday night, but the service was wonderful
Great decorations, nice background music, and, above all, clean bathrooms
It's hard to go wrong here
Total bill for 6 people, with wine and grat: $150
This is my absolute favorite place - I bring everyone I know here! The owner and staff are wonderful
The food is some of the very best and the outdoor garden is delightful
This has all of the other UWS side places (including those with Columbus Ave
outdoor seating) beat hands down!!! Give it a try for lunch or dinner!
There are many Italian Restaurants on the Upper West Side, but it is hard to find a good one
This restaurant has the most authentic Italian food at really easy to swallow prices
The Garden, with it's Monet-Like Murals is such a pleasure to have dinner in
Honestly, this place is top-notch!

The vibe couldn't be better - nice lighting and awesome loungy brazilian music
Great food and tasty martinis and fresh fruit caipirinhas
What a special place
Had lunch, thought it was great
Would return if I knew I was going to have a big dinner that night
Otherwise, not for someone like me whose main meal is lunch
Having a delicious crepe after lunch helped fill me up, but I'll still be starving later
I was pleasantly surprised to find this hidden SoHo gem
Portion size was great, crepes both sweet and savoury were tasty and filled with just enough of each ingredient to really balance the flavours
Cute ambience, especially on a warm summer day when the open air breezes through
Palacinka is one of my favorite small places to eat in the city--either by myself or with others
The lunch crepes are small, yet fulfilling, and are very fresh, but always very tasty
just enough
And I always recommend the banana nutella crepe as well
It is a nice place to bring friends to relax
The best light lunch and casual atmosphere
Don't come here expecting heaps of food, but a good light crepe with various fillings, toastey sandwiches, and 'sweet' crepes
Really really well priced
Casual
Just a very friendly, home like atmosphere
Highly reccomended if you are in the area and even if youre not
The nutella and banana crepe is to die for!
great place, cool ambience, very-well designed, candle light tables, packed with people, fun atmosphere
ambience was hard to top
food was cool, creative very good
i'd definetly recommend the food
wait staff was horrible! group next to us arrived 30mins after us and finished (yes finished) their meals before ours were served
i brought this up to the waitress and she blamed me! she said it was our fault because we ordered appetizers (which were cold appetizers by the way)
she sensed our disappointment and comped us two bottles of wine which was cool and somewhat made up for the slow service
I've been there 50 times and this place rocks
great atmosphere, great people and very good food that is not priced like Tribeca real estate!
You rarely find places like this in NYC- good food, reasonably priced (fixed price menu before 8pm rocks), not loud or too crowded and decent service
This restaurant got very good reviews from this site
I was surprised how bad the food was
It all seemed old, like a few days
The duck leg I had I could not eat because it tasted rancid-like
I believe it was a better restaurant in the past
The french posters all over the restaurant are beautiful
It was cheap but I rather pay more for eatable food
My friend's beef stew also tasted very old
The same goes for the mussels
it was fairly empty, no big surprise at about 8pm on a Tuesday
Tables fairly spaced, considering NYC's cramped norm
Wait staff attentive and accomodating
No music pumping to disrupt conversation, decor mainly vintage French advertisements
Had the apple tart with vanilla ice cream
Apples were soft as fresh powder in Vail, an excellent complement to the ice cream, rich and smooth
This place was great! You can't beat the $19 prix fixe menu
You get to choose from ANYTHING on the menu and nothing is off limits! I tried the Crab Croquettes (delicious, and yes, the sauce IS hot) and the Salade Jumelle (a good, basic mesculen salad)
For the entrees, I tried the Steak au poivre (very tender, though the sauce could use a touch more pepper), the scallops (delicate and delicious), and the Salmon (great flavor, interesting presentation, crispy on the outside, but juicy and flavorful on the inside)
Warning, I ordered the steak Medium well and it came out Medium
It was still delicious though
For dessert, the poached pear with chocolate sauce was amazing (they used a very good chocolate) and the Mud cake was good, but heavy
If you love Bistro's, this place is for you!
They have a burger with fries and a salad for 6 dollars! All the food is excellent, and I can say that because I have tried 75% of the menu
Go now
I went recently and had a great experience
The Pre Fix dinner is the best deal ever, for $18
The food was delicious and our waiter was the extremely friendly! I highly recommend this place
The best kept secret in NYC! Fantastic food, adorable waitstaff, down-to-earth atmosphere, at very reasonable prices
At $18 prix fixe, it's a wonder all of New York isn't there!
what a score!
Fantastic great quality food
From the fresh, and i mean fresh, mozzarella and tomatos, to the pasta cook just right, this place is a hidden treasure
The staff is freindly and prompt
We got a complimentry photo of me and my friends after becoming Nelson, the waiters, freind
Try it once and I guarentee you'll be back
Less fancy then it's neighbors, but cheaper too! Try the lobster capellini, or the stuffed artichokes
YUM
The inside ain't got much character but sit outside on a busy summer night and watch the tourists pour by, catch a glimpse of the empire state buidling framed by the street
Suck down some cheap chianti
Walk away with your wallet in one piece
The waiters are pretty nice and attentive
You won't be disappointed
Everyone I've taken there has loved it
My boyfriend and I (both born and raised in NYC and know a good slice when we eat one) moved to Battery Park 2 years ago
It's pretty, and clean, and quiet
but good luck if you're hungry
There's great Chinese in the Financial Center
but if you're not in a dumpling mood, you're out of luck for takeout
We discovered Raimo about 6 months later and order a couple of salads and a pie from them just about every weekend
We're moving next month and will really, miss thier pizza
It is that good
Nothing fancy, no brick oven - just a plain old excellent new york pie
The salads are fresh and delicious
and the guys who answer the phone are super friendly
We will miss you Raimo's! We really thought we owed you at least a good write up on CitySearch for all the great dinners! Cheers
Tribeca is not the pizza capital of the pizza capital
We may be the toughest place in NYC to get a decent pizza
Finally, after reading the original worth a try review, we gave Raimo's a try
And they deserved a second favorable review
Now if you're a thin crust pizza fan (and you should be), Raimo's is probably NOT for you
This is thick and chewy pizza -- just as valid a way to go
Generous amounts of cheese, sauce, and, in my case, pepperoni, with a chewy thick crust
I've also ordered a few of their dinners
Eggplant Parm dinner was very good
Pasta was solid
Excellent for the price and delivery is quick
Haven't visited the restaurant personally, but wouldn't hesitate
So, I'll give them 8 for ambience just so I don't disturb their overall score

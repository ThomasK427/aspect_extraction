I've had issues only with the seared tuna club, but it was better than the one I had at Odeon
Considering the recession that we're in, cafeteria is still the best place to eat
Inexpensive, and the best mac and cheese in town
The cafereria cosmo can't be beat
When your on your way home from bar and club hopping, there is nothing like stopping by this 24 hour diner in Chelsea for some eggs and a kir royale, though the bar does close sometime around 4
The patrons are hip trendy folks, chelsea boys, and even some regular people too
The food is cheap, and decent for the price, and the white space with outdoor seating is attractive
The bar is small and crowded, and I only wish you were allowed to smoke at your table, which is reserved for people who are dining
There is also supposed to be a pretty cool lounge downstairs, though its not always open
The staff has a horrible reputation, but I though the waitress was fine
I've been going to Cafeteria for over 3 years now and the food, service and ambience has improved from 'quite good' to 'always very good'
The place is always busy and very up with great service and cheap exceptional food
Music and ambience is always on point and perfect for meetings during the day and hot dates at night
Despite all the new competition and try hards in the neighborhood it remains my prime destination for anything sociable or fun
A very pleasant experience,promptly seated,great service, great food,very goodlooking people,clean and modern decor and best of all inexpensive
Five stars  *****
Great selection of food for all people
Missing mom's meatloaf, head to cafeteria
The ombiance may be a bit more like your own loft, but how cool to eat food like home
The service is generally friendly and food is delivered promptly
Don't forget dessert either
food is great
love the mac and cheese
meatloaf is just like mamas
sevrice though ---- that adage that actors cant be servers is painfuly true here where actor wannabees practice their blank pouty expressions on the guests and brings rachels and pheobes characters to real life
Well I have been to Cafeteria so many times and everytime has been an outstanding couple of hours
the food is hella good, come on where else can you get CHICKEN and WAFFLES
AND
A WATERMELON Martini
Dig the the Ambience and the trendy Hosts
The waiters are all but kind and helpful and attractive
especially the one that looks like lenny kravits
but becareful with him
Something tells me he's lonely and looking for love
Flirts with anything that comes in
All and all you'll have an awesome time
so sit back and just chill
;)
Really good food (and cheap), quick service (a little brisk at times), and great late night music
Really great music, actually
But their air conditioning SUCKS! Too damn hot, so wait until fall
Finally!!! A place that's open all night that has GREAT atmosphere- NO scary bright diner lighting or elevator music, it has a really sexy vibe all the time
So even at 4:00 AM my friends and i can feel like carrie and samantha even when we're pulling a patsy and adina!
The best way to end an evening but continue the fun
Great eggs benedict and really cute waiters
Prices are very reasonable and music has a really good vibe
I always count on it to be open and it has some of the best comfort food in N
Y

I walked in one night at approx
1:00 am on a Wed
with a friend and sat down at a table
There was no one at the door and the restaurant was quite empty
The bouncer came over and asked us rudely to get up and wait at the door (eventhough there was no one there)
We told him nicely that we would be happy to move if there was a problem with sitting at that particular table and we would ask the waiter/host when he came back
However as part of his power game, he was determined to make us stand up and wait and outrageously proceeded to ask us to leave
We asked to talk to the manager who seconded his decision
Totally absurd considering we are two nice, unthreatining girls and there were about 2 other tables in the whole place
This is the place to see and be seen
The food is great and the atmosphere is better
Good place to meet chicks
This is a great place for people watching and munching on light foods
I take all my friends to eat here
The french toast croissant with berries is absolutely terrific! The great part about Cafeteria is the basement area with a bar and egg cushioned seats for large groups to chatter away
Cafeteria is one of the most exotic place to have your lunch or dinner
It sure has the best food and the prices are reasonable
Not mentioning that the chef is non-other than Tyler Florence of food 911
and i always go there whenever i am in New York and that makes it almost every month
We went to Cafeteria after a nite of low-key partying
One of the people in our group still wanted to stay out, but others just wanted to eat
So, we chose Cafetria as a compromise
It was perfect way to end the nite
Trendy atmosphere, so-so-service, and great drinks
The food is great, price is unbeatable, waiters are nice and atmosphere is always right
Cafeteria is definitely among one of the best in town!
Yesterday was the first time I had been to Cafeteria
The restaurant is very modern, cool with young people dining and lounging
The place is set so that there are a bunch of white tables that offset a somewhat serene, simplistic setting
The lighting really sets the mood as a restaurant where dining and lounging are welcomed
I had great salmon there
I'd definately go back
On a side note, the service could have been a little better
This was my first time here
Waited 25 minutes to be seated for lunch
Don't understand the draw or popularity, neither the decor nor the food are above average
If sitting next to Sandra Bernhardt is the reason for their overpriced burgers and fried chicken, then I'll pass on dining here next time
Too much hype!
I'm wondering if most of the negative reviews are from people who experienced late-night problems
I went for lunch yesterday and had a lovely time
Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, the food was fantastic, and the prices can't be beat
The banana pudding isn't quite up to Magnolia Bakery standards, but it's still pretty fantastic
Cafeteria used to be one of my favorite restaraunts
Predictable, convenient, fast but good
Ive been a regular since it opened and lately things seem to be slipping bigtime
i waited 40 minutes for a sandwhich last week only to watch a couple seated afterwards finish their entrees before we even got ours
That was after waiting 30 minutes for a table
Ruined the night
A month ago I ordered tuna that had so much pepper on it - it was inedible
The mac cheese still is the best in town but the kitchen and service dont seem to be as reliable as in the past
I just wanted to add my thoughts about Cafeteria

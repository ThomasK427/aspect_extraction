Absolutely superb! Not only is the food to drool over, the service is something I have never experienced! The delivery guy forgot my drink, so I called and asked them for the drink
The manager came personally to apologize and to my surprise, he brought me the drink, a big chocolate chip cookie, and a bag of chips!!! Just to say sorry and that they'd appreciate my business again
I am utterly impressed and will be ranting and raving about this fab place to EVERYONE!
a great place for a salad or sandwich; both are excellent! nice place to relax as well
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant
fine dining restaurant quality
Over 100 different choices to create your own
A must try!
If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff
STARWICH has combined atmosphere, service and food in such a way that overpass any restaurant of its class
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it
Delivery service is great too
Thi swa sby far the best sandwich I have had anywhere in the city ! You can choose from a list of ingredients, right down to type of bread to fully customize your sandwich, and you really can't go wrong ! All of the ingredients are so fresh, tasty, and oh did I mention amazing! There is a cute communal dining room table couches to settle in with your AMAZING sandwich, or AMAZING Soup one of the newspapers hanging on the wall
Definitely worth the trip from anywhere in the tristate area
We have been waiting for someone to get it right -and Starwich had done just that
The food is innovative and excellent, and the service is great
It's great for a quick and delicious lunch and ideal for corporate catering
Our company will never use anyone else for our corporate catering needs
I love this place
The food is amazing, the atmosphere is great, the owner is the nicest guy ever
I live close by so I take all of my friends there often (the owner greets me with kisses, that's how I know it's often) :) The food is really really good, it's the kind of food you think about the next day
Extremely delicious food! I would eat there everyday If I could
You have to try the steaks, do not leave without trying!  Dont forget about their seafood as well! I highly recommend this place for anyone craving for great food, at a good price too! Dinner for two or entire family this is the place to go
Plenty of parking everywhere and close to highway and L train I'll see you there!
My friend recomend me the restaurant (chimu), I and my family we have such a great time and the food was fantastic
I highly recomend the restaurant
We really enjoyed the food, although the entree portions were way more than we could handle (which kind of annoys me), and loved the service
Very warm and friendly people
We had the empanadas as an app, which were great; the Aji De Gallina, which was chicken and potato covered with a creamy, slightly spicey sauce and was also very yummy; and the ice cream combo for dessert, which I highly recommend for its original flavor
Please go to give them more business!!
Food was great, flavorful and large portions
Owner was super nice
Overall a great night out and highly recommend it
Check this place out! The food is incredible, the atmosphere is fantastic
My girlfriend and have gone several times (she happens to live around the corner), and every time has been great
The steak is wonderful, as is everything I've had
You've gotta try the pisco sour
Unusual, but great
AND spectacular service! The owner is a wonderful guy who is there almost every night
One of my favorites in Willimasburg
great food! great steak! cheap! what more can i say! it was empty when i went, so before it closes, check it out!
This little place in Williamsburg is a hidden treasure
It has great Peruvian steak and seafood, great drinks, and is a great value too
The two times I've been there, I've tasted 4 completely different delicious meals (I split dishes)
The place was cute and was completely empty; no one seems to know about it
It's everyone else's loss
Great for dates or with friends
Clearly, I can't rave enough
I hope this place doesn't go under before it has a chance
Check it out! Short walk from Lorimer stop off the L
This place rocks, from their chicken caciatori pizza, to the frozen moocachinos, everything is first rate at this neighborhood eatery
Visit their ever growing market area where you can find anything from peter pan peanut butter to pate
The Scene Young couples on dates make up the vast majority of diners; that's a good thing, since the slim space is lined with two-tops and space at the bar is scarce
Servers rush about, weaving through waiting wine sippers to deliver pitchers of sangria
The atmosphere is fun, festive and friendly--it's an instant neighborhood hit
The Food The affordable tapas menu runs the gamut, from more traditional tapas like ham croquettes to intriguing inventions like the already infamous combo of chorizo and bittersweet chocolate, which is anything but frivolous once tasted
Snack on a bowl of fried chickpeas while you browse the menu, then move onto the tender lamb skewers, which arrive atop a slab of French bread, perfectly poised to catch the meat's sweet drippings
Specials shouldn't be overlooked, especially the braised veal cheeks sided with an herb puree and apple-fennel slaw
Forego dessert; instead, sip a Spanish sherry
So
i heard about Tia Pol because I used to work in Philly with a friend who worked with one of the owners of Tia Pol back when they were both at Ino (an amazing place in the West Village)
So i took my boyfriend there back in November
This review is long overdue, but it was an amazing experience
We did not wait too long for a table, and once we were seated, the food and drinks arrived promptly
the food was AMAZING, especially the croquettas
everything arrived in a flurry, it was sent out as the kitchen prepared it (which is the best way to eat this kind of spanish tapas food)
i cant remember how many plates we had, but it had to be at least 10 or 12
our waitress (amazing and friendly girl, ask for Meryl) suggested a great bottle of spanish wine for our dinner, along with spanish dessert wine, which i know nothing about
we left completely satisfied and full
I went back once or twice since then and its popularity has caught on
Hard to get a table, but i think they're open for lunch
I was told they're working on opening the back part of the property with more tables for the restaurant
Let's hope! But like I said, it's been a while
The days of a relaxing tapas evening at Tia Pol are gone
A recent visit found the bar seats to be under the control of the dim-witted hostess; marked with a placard 'These Seats are Reserved' immediately after the previous guests have left
The sangria pitchers are now heavy on ice and light on sangria; yielding just 3 wine glasses for your $28
The bartender compounds the disservice by not pouring the sangria on your behalf or offering the requisite spoon for digging the fruit bits from the colossal pile of ice left behind
The Dinner seating scheme is unintelligible with many tables left empty while guests and servers jab and jostle in the narrow entrance; most of the former not informed of the restaurant policy that allows you to place your name on the dinner list and then return hours later to claim your reservation
The wait staff does an admirable job and the kitchen continues to produce top-notch tapas variations
If you can handle front of the house ineptitude for an hour or so, the food is worth the wait
Sadly, a former neighborhood gem has fallen
I will not return
There're much better places in the city
Even for tapas the portions were ridiculously small, especially for the prices they charge
There were flies around the place too and just about anywhere you sit you'll feel you're in the way
Very disappointing expericence
even though there were plenty of tables available, a disorganized hostess tried to explain to us why there was a one hour wait
To be even more annoying, they include the bar area into their reservation policy
So forget about stopping by for a drink
Sorry
but attitude paired with a total lack of organization just does not go well together
getting seating at this tiny but cozy restaurant is challenging
if you go anytime around 7-9pm your bound to wait for 20-45 minutes
the seating waitress was pretensous and completely forgot to bring us water that we requested
the food overall was salty but decent
the lamb kabobs were okay
i think the restaurant is overrated, not a good value, and not worth the hassle
its one of those places that seems appealing if your looking in from the outside due to the long line

This is my favorite place to get a cupcake
The frosting is out of this world! Just walking up the block, the smell and the smiling faces of people leaving with those telltale little white boxes, lets you know good treats are around the corner
Yes, it's crazy crowded, but that's just a sign of how good it is
Sure, their cupcakes are heavenly, but their other stuff is crap
This place is good to bring an out-of-towner late on a weekend night, to grap a still-warm cupcake, and enjoy the campy atmosphere
That's about it
What a find! When I crave desserts like mom used to make, I think Magnolia Bakery
Recently tried their cupcakes - the buttermilk frosting ones wee dee-lish
Chocolate fondant was truly an experience to be savored
Wash it down with copious amounts of coffee
Banana cream pudding
Gilligan would crave this if only he knew about it
Excellent stuff
Served in a cup
Large or small
Would hazard a guess that other desserts on offer are equally good
I was pleased with the overall quality service
Though I was very disappointed on my first time there: I was allowed to buy more than 12 cupcakes at a time (I needed this for a birthday)
I wished somebody had put this on the web/informed the public of this
How sad this city does not want for wannabes who think because something is overpriced,buzzed up and backed up with customers then it must be good
Now that one of their cupcakes were on a Sex and the City episode the Lemming Lines are out the door
Everything they make is basically a Betty Crocker recipe souped up with more sugar and butter fat and fancy coloring
The only thing extraordinary they ever made was their ice cream but the price became obscene
If your place has a stove,buy any Betty Crocker anything and you'll see what you baked is similar only fresher
Another NYC triumph of buzz over substance
I like the classic bakery goods that both Magnolia and Buttercup offer
For the average person, there is little difference in the chocolate cake they bake
However, if youre looking for a last minute chocolate birthday cake and forgot to order one 2 weeks ago as Magnolia requires, go to Buttercup on the upper eastside
They have fresh 8 round cakes made daily
No advance order required
I had the worst time in trying to order a cake from them
The staff is as incompetent as they come
First, there's the responsibility shuffle, because only the staff in the back can take orders
I had arrived early and was told to come back in 15 minutes when they actually opened to place my order
That wasn't egregious, but having waited in the cold to get back in, I was then told because of mechanical difficulties, they wouldn't be able to take any orders
I suppose they couldn't have told me before
Their cupcakes aren't worth it, but their cakes, particularly the red velvet, does happen to be the best in the city
However, for the kind of disservice they provide, I'd rather go without than to step foot inside there again
The cupcakes are great but everything else is nothing really special
They have a nice variety of cheesecake but my girlfriend can make better
By the way, don't expect to find seating
Good luck of finding one
Overall, its an ok place
As one of the tour sites on the 'Sex and the City' tour visiting the Magnolia Bakery was one of the highlights for me, especially their irresistable cup cakes which left you wanting to sample all of the delights they had to offer
Simply wonderful
I think the food here is great--but you have to get where they are coming from: all the recipes are 1950's recipes--that means heavy, rich and high in butter
I never liked cupcakes, but i find the cupcakes here allright
my favorite is the hummingbird cake--i think it is bana walnut cake with a cream cheese icing
my friends always go for banana cream pie
i have also tried the german chocolate cake which tastes exactly like one my grandma used to make
don't plan on eating here unless it is middle of the day during the week
their are only like 5 seats
plan on take out
You can smell the goodness from blocks away
The place is cute with limited seating, there's always a crowd
Get a cupcake to go, because one is all you need to get your daily requirement of sugar and butter
Lots of goodies here, especially the banana pudding with vanilla wafers
You're not going to see Jared from Subway fame eating here anytime soon
With all of the hype over Magnolia bakery, I decided to try it
I was let down
If you are looking for a good cupcake, I recommend Buttercup Bake Shop, which the founder of Magnolia now owns
It has MUCH better food, and better prices
Magnolia is not as exciting as I'd hoped! The shop is also TINY and the staff RUDE
The cupcakes are self serve as well, which is disgusting
Everyone touching, sneezing, coughing
gross
well, after hearing wonderful things about this place, i went expecting something wonderful
there was plenty of evidence of homebaking, but the 'grandma's kitchen' vibe was lost with the added touch of the 'cool kids' serving you behind the counter
the cupcakes looked good, but tasted like they were made of pre-packaged mix
the banana pudding was lovely, although tasted like it was at least a day old
it's an expensive place
$4 for a cup of pudding
nah
great place to go to occasionally, but you pass about a million other bakeries and patisserie's on the way to try
The Cupckake Nazis! Proof of concept that if you make a second or third rate product, overcharge for it and cop some attitude along the way then people will come in droves
Firstly the icing on the babies are sickeningly sweet
The cake itself is a rather dry affair(akin to antacid tablet perhaps)
Oddly enough there are four or so different colors of frosting without any taste distinction between them
Blue tastes like the red - aghh food coloring! The people behind the counter are too cool for school, they routinely run out of cupcakes and although there are full trays of them behind the counter within sight they will make you wait
The price - a $1
75 a piece
That's about a $1
74 more than they are worth Oh yeah and the coffee was cold
Head the 39th St
Bakery or the ButterCream Bakery instead
I have watched them remove the cupcakes from the oven and still they taste like they've been sitting around for days?! Not enough oil, water-based?? Anything else I've tried, and I've tried to like something there as I live just a few minutes away, tastes either too sweet or tasteless
I'd rather eat my own hair
I always take friends here when I want to show them around the city
Buy a cupcake or two and eat it in the park nearby
The icing is buttery rich, not crunchy sugary like other icings, and the cake part is deliciously spongey
Fantastic variety of cupcakes, try them all!
It's true, Magnolia Cupcakes are divine
If you're a tourist looking for a slice of New York City nightlife encapsulated in a place that looks like your ole southern grandma's kitchen, then you should go to Magnolia
The pale green interior and the coconut flocked cakes will bring you back to a kinder, gentler era
And the cupcakes will leave you hallucinating in a fog of sugary delight
The service, on the other hand, can be lacking, though I think they fired the guy who could easily have been crowned Worst Customer Service Queen of the Universe
Go to Magnolia
You can start counting your Weightwatchers' points tomorrow
I recently tried the banana pudding and their to die for cupcakes
the banana pudding should not be overlooked but Out of the Kitchen Bakery on Hudson St

Not to mention the music was phenomenal making you want to dance to every song which was played
Coming from a hard-to-please, ex-chef, I was highly impressed with the cuisine, service and ambiance
[It's rare to find all three!] Some friends took me there for my birthday on a recent friday night
After getting soaked in the freezing cold rain, I was greeted by a lush environment and wonderful staff
The food was excellent and innovative
I loved the music and the vibe
and yes, the staff were lovely to look at, but more importantly, they were intelligent and personable
I went to this place just to get a bite to eat with my friend
The food was alright, the service amazing, but all of this was hard to take in because I couldn't get my eyes of that hot bar back
As long as they keep such a good looking staff I will be going back to Link
I had the greatest salad at Link --it was huge -- followed by a very tender steak
I can't even describe how yummy it all was! And I saw other tables getting desserts
sundaes with sparklers on top
I'd go back in a heart beat!
I went on a business lunch to Link because it is close to my work
Proximity was all it had to offer
The service was terrible and we were only one of three occupied tables in the place
We had to flag the waitress down to get a drink refill and waited an extrodinarily long time for our entrees
The food was mediocre to horrible
I had their Fish and chips
I got two pieces of fish, one good and one grey, with very over seasoned herb fries
Just two of these fries haunted me for the rest of the day
Their Chicken Pot Pie was like soup with a lid on it, there is much better to be had close by
Link may be an okay bar but I wouldn't recommend it for food!
I enjoyed the design and layout, and the waiters were super-friendly and served up great drinks
As a bar, I would definitely reccommend going here
If PR people are hanging around this place writing reviews, at least write them like normal people
These catchy phases and 10 ratings are very anoying
Nobody writes like that
I went soon after Link opened and the food was excellent for the price, but the service was very slow
I didn't mind because I was hanging out with friends, and I'm hoping the kitchen is quicker now that it has had some time
I'd go back
we went there for a birthday last night - the place is great a mixture iof bar and lounge seating and music at a level that allows you to talk and not yell to friends - its a really great crowd friendly design - with high ceilings which make it feel open and airy!! and destined to become a really popular new place- greatest find we have had in a long timw
What a great place to hang out! The lounge is funky and laid back and the drinks are oh sooo good! And what a great mix of people, I'd bring both friends and co workers here and expect an amazing time!
I had a fabulous night of dinner and drinks here! The crowd was classy and fun, the service personable and prompt, and the atmosphere was all that and more! Plus the decor makes for a trendy mod evening!
The place was nice and the bartenders were friendly, but the cocktail girl was rude, obnoxious, and over charging all of us
The managers didn't do a thing when I mentioned it to them
Will not be back
It looks designed for a Soho locale but both the service and crowd prove it's much further uptown
We waited 20 min for a drink (after the wrong one was brought to us), the sweetbreads were gamey, the scallops tasteless
And our waiter seemed like he needed to run to the bathroom every time he hurriedly came over (though he never asked how everything was)
Too expensive for what it is
If there were more places like this (but with better food) in the area, no one would eat at Link
Although Link's decor is sleek, the menu is as tasteless as the modern hospital building in which the restaurant is housed
The shortribs were sour, the lamb confit vomitous
It's almost as if they wrote the menu to sound good, but never considered how it would taste
This one's a loser
A great new spot
Worth trying and returning to
Try the amuses as a start and save room for dessert
A welcome addition to the neighborhood with great food and atmosphere
Link has great flavorful food and the prices are totally reasonable
The ambiance is great
Just the perfect amount of candle lighting for either a romantic evening or just a night out with friends
The best tasting short ribs in town!
I held a birthday gathering at Link for my husband at Link on a Tuesday night
It was a great place for the our 15 or so guests-- not too crowded, but a lively ambiance
The staff could not have been nicer or more attentive to our group
Also, of the amuse bouches, the calamari and salmon tartare were excellent
Whether you are looking for appetizers and drinks, or a multi-course meal
Link is a new find that stands out among the best
You must try the little cheese plate
this is not your ordinary cheese!
the food is amazing-i can't get the chocolate fondue off my mind!n
LINK has a very friendly, party-type atmosphere that is a great base for a fun evening out
I've been a few times, and have consistently enjoyed the food, the staff and the look and feel of the spot
Try the fried cheese on the Amuse menu! its awesome
What's in a Flirtini? Who cares, it is so delicious, it makes you want to try all of the martini drinks on the menu! Great place for drinks
There is room for improvement on the food, however, the menu is decent and provides variety
Great cool space, Fab food and great service, definately worth visiting
I recently visited Link ,and then again again and again
It has become my favorite spot
The atmosphere is really great and the place attracts really  hip crowd
Greaaaaaaat bar ,they have the most amazing bartenders!!!These girls are amzing( no fence ,guys too
)
Go Girls!  If You'll go You gonna have good time
who do they think they are???? service was horrible with lots of attitude
in a neighborhood with so many restaurants why not provide a good quality!!!! shame on you!!!
Totally cool, comfortable, funky setting
The right lighting, the right price, fun delicious drinks (try the link drink
) The amuses are also great and cheap--especially the fried calamari
Great place to meet a group of friends or go on a date
Beautiful place
Very sexy
A perfect place for everyone
The food is extraordinary and the service is warm
friendly and professional
Take a first date out for dinner or relax with a bunch of friends in there sexy late night lounge
Link is a great addition to the neighborhood, the bar and lounge are unpretentious, and fun, and the great bartenders are serving up some of the best cocktails I have had in NYC
They offer a great amuse menu at the bar, I loved it
What a great addition to the neighborhood
Excellent food, great service
The bartenders are v/ nice and cool
Will be there often
The Scene A lengthy, shiny dark-wood bar is telling of this Austrian restaurant's aspirations--and its customers
In true Viennese style, Paul Goebert (Max    t, sour cherries and gherkins
Move on to the delicious chicken paprika, stewed on the bone and served with a creamy sauce over spaetzle
The staff's favorite treat: Rich chocolate custard buried under whipped cream
We live down the block from Steinhof, so of course there is the convenience factor, but this place has been a consistent pleasure for us over the many years that we've been going: drinking, chatting with the friendly neighbors - many of them musicians and writers - watching the mostly funny Sunday night movies, and thoroughly enjoying their Austrian/German/Hungarian dishes (which we are able to do now without a dictionary)
I highly recommend the chicken paprikash with spatzel and the seafood bowl, which is loaded with fish, mussels and seasonal vegetables

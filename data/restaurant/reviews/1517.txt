We ate really fast because we were starved by then
Then we kept waiting for the check, but no one came by
We finally just left the table and went to the front to pay
They forgot to charge the pelligrino, and had charge our card AGAIN
Thought they would at least give us the water for free after the bad experience, especially since they forgot to even put it on the bill
The food here was excellent and the ambiance was charming
As a foodie who has been to some of the best restaurants in the nation's major cities, I was pleasantly surprised when I was introduced to this little treasure in Montclair, NJ
The cuisine: fusion
Includes a diverse array of entrees ranging from Boar (prepared in your choice of either the French or Asian tradition), Mussels, or Pad Thai that grace the menu all at once, each one prepared in a distinctly different and delicate sauce


appetizers are not to be missed either, Mushroom Ravioli, Curried Puffs stuffed with Prawns, Escargot, Foie Gras??? Need I say more? Yes
Bring your own wine, and don't forget to leave room for one of their many deserts
The bananas and ice cream are amazing
This place is wonderful from the atmosphere down to the coffee
The live performances are great and there always seems to be something new when you go there
I went there on a sunday around 1:15 or so
When me and my dad first walked in, we walked into a bar, which didn't seem right
There was a room down a hallway
That's where the jazz brunch was
It was a fairly small room, but it was bright and airy, not at all like I expected
As soon as we entered, a hostess seated us and gave us menus
Mostly everything had eggs in it
The service was kind of slow
The music was good though
It wasn't very jazzy though, but in my opinion, I think that's better
The guitarist//violinist//bangoist played with the keyboardist for all the while me and my dad were there
The food was good
I had an egg and cheese sandwhich
Parking in downtown montclair is usually pretty bad, but there was a parking lot very close by
My boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner last night, looking forward to another good meal
(We'd visited several months back and were impressed with both ood and service)
This time, ordering a beer was a 10-minute-long process
every beer he ordered was out of stock
The waiter didn't charge us b/c it took so long
I ordered the Mediterranean Cachet
same as last visit
It's supposed to have scallops and kalmatia olives
both of which were missing upon BF's sandwich came on a plain hoagie roll, while the menu advertised sourdough bread
I noticed that the couple next to us was also being told things were out of stock when placing their order
When we brought our issues to the waiter's attention, he assured us he'd take care of it
When he came back, he informed us that the powers that be said we could give our half-eaten food back either order something else or not be charged
Not wanting to make a huge issue since the food WAS edible, we declined
It was 10pm, and we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for something else to arrive
We assumed he'd still comp us SOMETHING on the bill
Nope
the bill arrived with everything we ordered on it
No manager came out to apologize
The waiter seemed somewhat irritated with us
Is it too much to ask for food to be served as described on the menu? And if a KEY ingredient is out of stock, isn't the typical protocol to TELL the patrons first
not make substitutions without consent
God forbid I was allergic to shrimp! Overall, the food was lackluster and the management lacking in etiquitte and customer service skills
My bf summed it up on the check
we had a great time LAST time, but will NEVER be back after this fiasco
A shame, since we're probably moving into the area
and had we been treated graciously, South Park likely would have become a regular restaurant for us
The first thing you notice is the high prices, which do not equate to paper napkins, homely table settings, and teenage waitresses with exposed belly-button rings
Then comes the dry, overcooked, unsightly food
This restaurant embarrasses the city of Montclair
Make this spot your regular haunt
for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert
The only thing that beats the interesting and fresh food is the atmosphere and the personal touch when Raymond himself greets you
Once you try Raymond's, you'll understand why
AMAZING! sushi is fantastic and fresh, we go every week! the friendly service cant be beaten
SUSHI HANA is a must-try
i've been going there for 7 years already ever since they opened, even though i've tried many other japanese restaurants throughout the years that claim to be excellent, i always find myself coming back to SUSHI HANA
They have a menu to suit every palate from vegetarian to meat lovers
i'm a steak and sushi fan, the variety of sauces like nagano garlic sauce and shiitake mushroom sauce is delectable and the meat is always cooked to perfection
yummy
great food at great prices! im recently out of college and in love with the sushi scene however this love of mine is usually expensive but at Sushi Hana i can get the best tasting and freshest sushi without ever worrying about the tab
the sushi for two is great for me and a friend when out in town for fun, the assortment and inclusion of soup and salad makes for a pleasant evening
We went there twice to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke
Both times the service was terrible and the food was OK at best
With so many good places in Montclair, there is no reason to go to Palazzo
Am surprised no one has highlighted this restuarant
The food is excellent, the service is very good
The ambience is well set
I would highly recommend it
Mexicali Rose use to be one of my favorites restaurants but not anymore
Since they change owners is not the same, the food have change and to make it worse the manager is just a pain
I was sitting with my husband outside trying to have a great time and just to see the way the manager was treating the waitress (just ruing my night)
After I have my dinner I try to talk to the manager and let him know that he had very good workers and that he should be more considerate with them and the answer that I got from him was (THey can leave I don't care)
and after that he told me (Don't take the glass with you) like I'm going to still it
The owners better put that manager in the place or they will lose a lot of people
We loved the ambience at Mexicali Rose and there's a lot to look at while you're waiting for your food
The menu is packed with a lot to choose from but it's WHAT you choose that can be hit or miss
My chicken breast, although covered with a delicious sauce, was very dry and the rice too salty
Waiter had to be summoned twice for us to receive the complimentary chip and salsa(they were delicious) and to wipe the table
My friend's fajitas were delicious
Not the best Tex Mex but not the worst I've ever had
I am so dissapointed in this place since the original owner, Dominick sold it
The food quality has really gone downhill
The people are nice, but it's just not the same anymore
Rather good mexican food, and always served piping hot
The ambience is great, always something to look out
Service is great and the owner is almost always on hand to make sure you dining is a pleasure
Prices are moderate and menu is expense
Bring your own bottle
Wines and spirit store across the street
Once you try it you will always return

The spinach salad was great too!
I started going to Three of Cups several years ago and it has become my home away from home
The food is always right on, they have the kind of dishes that you think about having all day
The staff has always been friendly and attentive, and create a vibe that makes you feel at home
The atmosphere makes ot easy to stay for a while and if you really want to stay, check out the Lounge downstairs that has great rock 'n roll, cheap drinks, beautiful bartenders and is open 'til 4am
I love the food at 3 of Cups
It has rarely let me down
But, the service is simply the worst
Don't go there! Order in (they deliver) and the food arrives faster, fresher and with a smile
Go to the restaurant and you'll be disappointed
although the food is good, the service is terrible
we had to ask for the check four times and they had a problem with our friend who showed up late and just nobbled on some bread
they took the bread away from him! how cheap! especially after our table of 5 had 6 bottles of wine and a full dinner
Our opinion - order for delivery or to go
I have been going to Three of Cups for years and the food has only gotten better over the years
The pizza has always been one of the BEST ANYWHERE
The staff is always accomadating and friendly
They have a Lounge downstairs that hosts some of the coolest Rock n' Roll parties with really cute bartenders
I hope they continue to do just what they're doing right now!!
I am at a loss to understand the praise and high rating for this restaurant
I went to Three of Cups once and would never go again
The food is barely acceptable standard fare for a pizza place that also serves Italian-American food
The pizza itself was inedible - the crust both burnt AND soggy
The tables are also very cramped
Don't believe the hype! This restaurant may be a nice casual hangout, but doesn't deserve to be on a best list for the quality of its food
Excellent Pizza, Food and friendly Staff
I like to go with friends and sit in a booth eat and hang out, then go down stairs and listen to the DJ and talk all night
Truly one of the few really comfortable places where you can get a great meal, or just hang out at one of their two bars
One thing that you can count on in life is amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Three of Cups always has pizza that will make your mouth water
amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; I am always happy with the tasty thin crust pizza and the amazing combinations of gourmet elements that are placed on top
That combined with an affordable bottle of great wine
But the pizza is great t share in the beginning, just an appetizer for one of their fabulous pasta dishes
The atmosphere while you eat is inviting, friendly, and comforting
You can choose to eat alone, bring your date, or party with friends
Three of Cups is my safe spot
Some places are good sometimes, but Three of Cups is good all the time
Having been to Three of Cups a couple of times I can only say that the food is mediocre
Owners/managers of the restaurant must be writing the glowing reviews and voting repeatedly for the restaurant in multiple categories for Citysearch's Best of
My boyfriend and I are regulars here
The food is always great, the atmosphere always cozy and the staff always warm and friendly
I take out-of-town guests here and they love it
I've only been here once, but I'm sure to return again and again
This place was recommended to me by several members of the Montalenti family and I'm so glad that I went
This is the place you always want to go back
Nice atmosphere, wonderful and friendly people and great food!
The food is superb, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is conducive to intellectual encounters of the nth dimension


a must try in New York
By all means recommend it to friends and relations
Three Of Cups, has great food, great atmosphere and a great crowd
good good stuff, all the time
best pizza in the USA
Great people, good food, good times
this place has a great atmosphere when you walk in, it's too bad the servers ruin it
went in w/a big(ish) group and our waiter was giving us the evil eye even before we'd ordered
he snapped at us when we ordered different glasses of wine (rather than ordering a bottle, which we didn't want), dropped a knife on my friend's head (w/o apologizing), spilled our drinks on us repeatedly (w/o apologizing), sighed and rolled is eyes every time we ordered anything
we weren't being demanding or obnoxious, we were there to hang out and have dinner
the food's okay, but it isn't worth putting up w/MAJOR attitude from inept servers
The food is very good at Three of Cups and the atmosphere is very romantic
The value is good and it's a great place for birthday dinners and first dates
Try the Chicken Mustardo
It's devine!
Decorated in a Medieval castle look, Three of Cups has great Italian cuisine, reasonable prices and friendly service
Just the place for a witch to unwind!
I wandered around the east village one lovely sunday and came about the Cups restaurant
An enchanting and sweet little Italian bistro
No pretension, but lots of loving, friendly people! And the bread and the brick oven pizza is above and beyond any I've had in the city
and i have had them all
And if you aren't in the mood for sauce, but still want pizza, try the Margarita Pizza
Out of this world!!
No better pizza in New York doesn't BEGIN to tell the story of Three Of Cups
Nothing ANYWHERE comes close to their awesome mouth-watering pizzas
Try the one with Truffle Oil, or the Soppressata, or the Four Cheeses, or the fresh Arugula Al Giardino
They're all pitch-perfect in every aspect: crust, toppings and seasonings, all heavenly balanced
And the place is Just Great, with that authentic crustaceous old-time East Village character that's become all too rare around town
It's just a PERFECT HANGOUT
Check it out!
Fire is back and this genuine brick oven from the early 1900?s gives every tasty morsel that special flavor
Fueled by big chunks of wood, this oven cooks one of the best tasting pizza this side of the solar system
Whether is a baked potato, bread, pizza or calzone, the food sparkles with taste and flavors
If you enjoy huge salads, big tasty portions, at inexpensive prices, Three of Cups is the place
Darkly lit local restaurant, bar and lounge serving up the best pizza (period!) in the City
Laid-back crowd, great food, great music, reasonable prices
Check out the lounge downstairs - favorite of the locals in the E Village
When you want the best thin-crust pizza in town and a good selection of salads and pastas, Three of Cups is hard to beat
It's worth going out of your way for
I think nothing of schlepping from Lincoln Center after an event all the way to the East Village for a visit to Three of Cups, even though it's not on the way home
This Place was always a great place for Dates
Good food and they don't rush you out, you can linger over a cup of coffee or wine talking after your meal
Plus it's also good for group of friends
3 of my friends Ate and drank with the for 75 dollars
Everything is excellent
Food, Service, Drinks , Music
You can't get it any better !
The Scene Stepping into Frank is like entering a sepia-toned photograph
Pinched lace peeks out from antique cabinetry, ornate mirrors overhang a marble bar, and stained glass illuminates a communal banquet table
But the quaint rummage-sale charm quickly transforms to a hip, lively vibe with the din of diners and the chaotic, sardine-can bar scene of waiting parties
Though the host is selective and aloof, accommodating servers somehow make their way through tightly packed tables
The Food Frank Prisinzano's home-style recipes pride themselves on fresh ingredients

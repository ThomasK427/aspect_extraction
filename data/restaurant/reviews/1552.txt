But DO NOT go out of your way to come here
If you are planning a trip to NYC don't plan a special trip to this place
It tastes exactly like the same pizza you can get anywhere else
It's just very generic pizza
There are so many other places in your own neighborhood that have pizza that tastes the same
It was two hours late, the wrong order, and cold
it wouldnt have came at all but we called approx 10 times to check up on it over a span of two hours
and no, we couldn't get any kind of discount
dont order delivery if you want to get it before you grow old and die waiting
This place is on the same block as Katz's deli
Man, this block is a disappointment! The food at Katz's is unedible, and the pizza here is just average
It tastes like the same generic pizza I've had at hundreds of other places in the tri-state area
It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't worth raving about or going out of your way to go to this place
If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you are hungry, stop in for a slice
Otherwise, if you live far away - just order delivery from your local pizza place - there is no difference - REALLY! There is nothing special about this pizza
C'mon New York! Why is the food in NYC at best Average
thick mushy dough, too much cheese, and too much sauce; some of the worst i've had in NY
(although it competes w/ the best in CT)
I tried this place because the previous review said that the cheese was really good
It is! It was a great-quality pizza, delivered promptly, for a reasonable price (!)
great cheese pie! fast delivery
super friendly service
the ultimate pizza delivery spot in my LES hood
love you guys
I ordered a large pie with extra cheese and pepperoni and discovered a light, crispy, and delicious crust beneath
It's a solid pizza for the money and way better than a big-brand kind
Everytime I return to New York, I hit Ray's on my way out on the town
It's location is perfect if you're partying in the Village, and it's the best I've ever eaten anywhere
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
Service is extremely fast esp
since its always packed
The WIFI is cool and no one makes a better mocha cappaucino
But its Starbucks so its on the xpensive side for coffee but what you expect
The Scene It's not just about the ice cream
Ben and Jerry, two childhood friends from Vermont, built their empire on a great product laced with social awareness
Sit in this scoop shop, grab an unbleached napkin and gaze at the murals depicting hormone-free cows munching in green, organic pastures
While you're there, pick up literature supporting some local environmental causes
The Food What a difference pure, delicious ingredients can make
Favors include Chunky Monkey, Phish Food, Cherry Garcia and New York Super Fudge Chunk, just to name a few
Decadent sundaes swim in real hot fudge topped with fresh, homemade whipped cream
Cookies, brownies and waffle cones are lovingly baked each day in-house
For the light-at-heart, there are sorbet splashes--refreshing, fat-free fruit slushies
Tasty, fresh, rich, creamy and unique flavors that aren't available in other icecream parlors
The  combination of ingrediants are scrumptous
Ben and Jerry's rocks! where else can you get flavors like Cherry Garcia, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Chunky Monkey, Phish Food, New York Fudge Brownie, Karmel Sutra, Wavy Gravy, Concession Obsession etc
the list goes on
it's more expenisve then other ice cream places but worth it
The BEST ice cream ever! Unbelievable varietywith choices from Vanilla to Phish to practically anything else your heart desires
And low fat and frozen yougurt version of many popular flavors are available
It's the famous Ben Jerry's! It tastes pretty good, but not awesome
It has too much sugar
People are friendly there
In Short Since first opening in 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill
, McDonald's has become one of the most recognized brands in the world

Tracy J's is a great after work spot if you work in the area the happy hour specials are great and the owner, Art loves to give out free tee-shirts and food to his patrons
the only downside to this bar is the attitude of the female bartenders who seem to hate everyone for no apparent reason
It's a great place to watch TV, eat a delicious dinner at the bar, listen to the regualrs chat
The meatloaf is DELISH
We went here a few nights ago on what happened to be Karaoke Night
Turns out that it was a $7 minimum drink order per person, so my girlfriend paid $14 for our two light beers
When we went up to get what we assumed would be our second drink at no charge, the bartender charged us $5 a piece
So 24 bucks plus tip for four light beers? we asked
She said, I charged you $14 up front because that's the minimum, you had to have ordered two beers each up front
Now we have to charge you again
When we protested, she proceeded to rudely talk down to us and act like a know-it-all
Needless to say, we left
Don't bother with this place -- you can get the same dive-bar ambience without the bad service, tricky beer specials and oodles of 30-year-old ex-frat boys elsewhere
I just ate my first bagel from Bob's and was inspired to immediately write my first-ever Citysearch review
These bagels are fantastic
The onion bagel was light and flakey and you could actually taste the wheat in the whole wheat bagel
This is the new standard for NYC bagels
Their bagels have the perfect firm outer crust with a nice soft inside
and the staff are experts at creamcheese spreading!
HOORAY, BAGEL BOBS!  Very friendly staff (especially Leo)
fast, inexpensive and DELICIOUS
On Paddy's Day they put GREEN food coloring in their bagels
Brilliant!
The bagels are so fresh, you can taste it
I always get a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with the cinnamon-walnut spread
Too nice! The salmon bake spreads are also hard to turn down
The place just got renovated a few months ago, so it looks so nice and clean now
$0
25 bagels on Mondays 4-7, so lines are a little long!
very yummy bagels, the staff is a little rude but fast and they dont make many mistakes, so who cares?
hot hot hot! best and freshest bagels EVER! the lines are long but that's good
means the more bagels they need to make, always keeping them hot right out of the oven
Awesome bagels, spreads, egg sandwiches
Newly renovated/expanded too and fast delivery
can't lose with this one
Their coffee is only 75c a cup and it is fabulous
Even my true Italian friend loves their coffee
The guys behind the counter are very friendly, very fast and they deserve a mention
The bagels are your run-of-the-mill bagels, hard to do that wrong
But they're always very fresh

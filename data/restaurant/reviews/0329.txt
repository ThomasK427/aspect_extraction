the service was impeccable; they accommodated 6 of us on my friends birthday including an 8 month old girl! very friendly and professional (they provided two bowls of hot water to heat the baby food in)
unfortunately the porterhouse we ordered was on the bland side
all five of us had to add salt to the steak
although it was cooked well (crisp and charred on the outside) the steak really lacked that burst of flavor you usually find with dry-aged beef
As an absolute fan of all thinks steak, top honors to MarkJoseph
This place may have been started by a Luger's cast off, but even after 5 trips across the river in teh past year, I have to declare MJ the winner of the steak wars! Perfect steak is coupled with this well-bred steakhouse, servers are quick and courteous, respect that you're plunking down big coin for a great piece of beef, and let you enjoy your evening
It may be a bit out of the way (remember it's the off shoot of the 'other' Water street) but well worth the hunt!
This a great alternative to Luger's
This is a place that you can take the girlfriend/wife and that she will actually enjoy eating there
Food, drinks, and wait staff are the best
Been going there off and on now for a few years
It is always the best service and great food
I just have to say, after reviewing other reviews on this site they don't give this rest restaurant enough kudos
I have been a patron to MarkJoseph since it's inception and can honestly say that i have never had a bad meal
All have been superb!!! Along with the great food come John, Joe, Charlie JC and the rest of the best wait staff in NY
They make the experience that more enjoyable
So when in town do yourself a favor and give it a shot if your in the mood for the BEST STEAK IN NY!!!
Not only the steaks, all the food is great
The bacon and shripm salad, the creamed spinach, the grilled tuna are magnificent
The atmosphere is cordial and relaxed
Very satisfying in all respects
Been to Mark Josephs a several times and was always amazed by the porterhouse
Cooked to perfection charred buttery outside
Side dishes also good (no side comes with a $60 steak?), lobster was great (what good is a porterhouse if its not flanked by a few tails?), seafood platter appetizer is A+
Never got out out for less than $100 per person but it seemed worth it
Then something changed
The last two times I went (went back the second time out of utter disbelief) the porterhouse was nothing but grizzle? Each time I sent it back they replaced it with one no better
I think even the maitre'd was embarrassed
Took the steak off the bill but it didnt really matter, you cant put a price on a bad night
Maybe they changed chefs or meat suppliers? However, with two strikes they're out
A group of my friends (15) and I go to a different steakhouse every 3-4 months
In Sept 03' we decided to try MarkJoseph's and were not dis appointed
The food was excellent
From the cracked lobster and scungelli (which I usally don't eat but could'nt get enough of on this day) to the poterhouse which I would rate in the top 5 in the city
The waiters could not have been nicer and the desserts looked wonderful, but I could not eat another bite
Hopefully I'll be able to control myself next time and I'll be able to give the dessert a try
Looking for a romantic evening for two or a nice place to take the wife and kids? Not here! This is a place for carnivores who relish in the finest seared beef Manhattan has to offer
This is a no-frills kind of place where food and service take presidence over presentation and atmosphere
A mecca for hardcore steak lovers who dont need the hype of a more well known NY steakhouse, because the steak is the best in NYC! Don't get cought up in the hype of a Lugars (ok) or Old Homestead (worst in NYC) when you can have better beef and even use your credit card!
Go for the Steaks
I haven't yet done Lugers, but these were fantastic
The porterhouse was seared perfectly
The middle was cooler than I like, but the meat was so good I would have eaten it raw
The wait staff was friendly and knowledgable, but expect the 3rd degree from the maitre'd if you're not wearing an armani suit
Do you love Peter Luger? Try Mark Joseph! Same steaks
extended menu for the ladies
better atmosphere
better service (no grumpy old men)
same prices
I'll never go to Luger again
If you haven't been to MarkJoseph, you haven't been to the best steak house in NY
or maybe anywhere
This is one of the better filets I've had, and one of the largest
Probably twice the size of a filet at another steakhouse, so bring your appetite
I agree with earlier reviews that the steaks are undercooked from normal, but that's the way I like it anyway so it was perfect
Get the bacon as well to start, its the best $2 you will ever spend
The service was excellent
We didn't have to do anything really
But the place was half empty
The place itself leaves alot to be desired, and finding it is somewhat of a pain in the neck, but if you go to restaurants for the scene then you shouldn't be going to steakhouses
Definitely one of the better ones!
Blow's Luger out of the water, the right atmosphere and excellent hospitality
Steak done right!!!!
while the carbon copy Luger menu was pretty much alright, the room is awful, like eating in a holiday inn in the midwest
The service was downright rude, and the broker boys are way too noisy in a way that makes peter luger's look quaint
Cross the bridge
Amazing food and great service
The steaks however were not cooked like we asked
Medium Well was more like RARE and Well Done was more like Medium Well
everything still tasted amazing
especially the lobster bisque
I can only think of one reason this is not the BEST steakhouse in manhattan: It is a little out of the way
The food is exceptional
Steaks every bit as good a Lugers (probably due to the chefs influence
He used to be a Lugers) The wait staff is far more attentive than Lugers and the scenery is far more etherial
Top notch!
All the acerbic charm that one expects from a steakhouse with the best damn steak found in Manhattan
I've worked downtown for some 3 years now
In general, food is just passable in the area
I didn't know that MarkJoseph existed
Someone told me about it and said it had former Peter Luger owners/employees
I went there today and was pleasantly surprised to experience the sort of quality dining I used to enjoy when I worked uptown
I wouldn't go there all the time (especially on my own nickel) because of the price, but I'll certainly go there occasionally
Went to Mark Joseph's this past weekend and had a magnificent porterhouse
If you like Luger's but are tired of traveling to Brooklyn, want better service and more options on the menu this is your place
Hands down one of the top three steakhouses in NYC
Went to MarkJoseph's and I now have a new favorite NYC steakhouse
Better than Benson's, Palm, Ruth's Chris, Peter Luger or any I've been to
I ordered the filet mignon, it was so tender and flavorful, I thought I was dreaming
I also had a bite of the sirloin and ribeye my companions were having and they were of equal quality
Tremendous seafood appetizer of lobster, shrimps, clams, calamari mussels
Sides were Ok, nothing special but good
I can't say enough about the dessert
Melt in your mouth cheesecake that has to be experienced to believe
Service was professional, pleasant informative
Although it was a bit rushed
The time in between courses should be a little longer
We were just finishing the appetizers when the steaks arrived
All in all, a great steak experience was had in this out of the way hidden gem under the Brooklyn Bridge
I went to MarkJoseph with high hopes that it would live up to its reputation of being the Peter Luger of Manhattan

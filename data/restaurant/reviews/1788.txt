Their $25 Prix fixe menu is a very good value
The service was awesome! The hostess called my name for our reservation almost immediately
The food was served promptly and was really hot
The waiter suggested great desserts that looked deliscious when they arrived
By the way the fries are to die for
yummy!
Service counts for a great deal
It wasn't a good omen if the hostess never found my reservation that I made three weeks ago
The food took forever to come out from the kitchen
The waiter forgot to put in our dessert requests and when they did arrive, one order was misplaced
Since they served us our coffee before dessert, you would have thought they would have offered to refresh them
Instead they got cold
And the boast that they have NY's best fries, is an overstatement
Chelsea Bistro and Bar was a truly enjoyable dining experience
I made reservations for a party of four, we were seated immediately, and the room was cozy and quiet
We could actually hear one another speak at this sophisticated but non-snobby institution
And the food was top-notch
I highly recommend - the food was pricey but not shocking at all
What a pleasant experience! From making the reservation to the time we left
The food is outstanding, the wines well picked and according to my husband the bartender can make A mean martini
The host was helpful and gracious (we later found out that he was the owner - That always makes a difference)
The menu offers many light dishes and is geared more toward seafood
We will definately be back with friends to take advantage of the 15% Off promotion they run during the summer
Excellent, well chosen wine list
The food is expensive, but then you do get what you pay for
Every meal I've eaten here has been superb
My only complaint- the service could be better: the sommelier could be more available, or at least, the wait staff could be better informed about the wine selection
Chelsea Bistro has the wine, food and service to satisfy business dining, a romantic evening or just a great night out at the Bistro
Chelsea Bistro is a snapshot out of France with upscale service
Despite the number of bistros in New York, it remains a challenge to find the authentic bistro
We had dinner there several times
We sat in a romantic booth by the fire place and green house room
Both are equaly charming
Although seating in a dining room with a fire place in the middle of winter adds to the experience
The food was outstanding and very consistant
It is undeniably French and does not lack creativity
The extensive wine list can be overwhelming at first! They offer a selection raging from the low $20's - $800's
Fortunately there is plenty of wines to choose from in the lower price range
Nothing is perfect - I would say that on weekends the noise level can be disturbing
That aside, this bistro is definitely worth a trip to Chelsea
It's like going to France with neither the airfare, jet-lag nor the attitude
Chelsea Bistro is nice if you like spending $9 on a glass of wine
There's no bottle of wine under $30
My meal was good but we're still in an economic downturn and these prices were just too much
Desserts for example are $8
50 a pop
Entrees are at least that
Service was also less than attentive but that may have had something to do with my not ordering said appertizer/dessert
In sum, I'd say it's nice if you've got the dosh
The service was so inept that our dining experience managed to cross the line from offensive to surreal
While we waited an hour and change for appetizers to emerge from the kitchen's Bermuda Triangle, other tables in the mostly empty dining room breezed through three courses
No explanation was offered, letting our imaginations run wild as I visualized a harried chef chasing a runaway snail around the kitchen with a fishing net, like in a cartoon
No explanation either for a subsequent half-hour wait for our entrees, which arrived without the requested sides
Getting the manager to admit anything had gone awry was like debriefing a hostile witness
An artful session of good-cop/bad-cop elicited an offer of a complimentary dessert, but by then my date and I were simply anxious to leave
Superior bistro fare abounds in the neighborhood; try Le Singe Vert or the lovely Gascogne instead
That's the Uncle Moe's logo!! I've been going to Uncle Moe's in Park Slope, Brooklyn for years but now that I've moved back to the city, I was thrilled to find they had a location right near U
Square! The food is unbelievable and well prepared - esp
the vegetarian burrito and cheese enchiladas
Top it off with a tamarindo drink and you're in Mexican heaven
This is my local for lunch and it rocks, Moe's is worth looking for
the food is top notch--i like to have grilled corn and the zucchini added to my chicken burritto
it's a fun place to eat--a magnet for super-cute guys who work in the hood, so a treat for the eyes as well as the tummy
I used to work on 20th street, so I frequented this spot
The lunch line moves quickly and the staff is efficient and polite
The food is fantastic! I love the vegetarian burritos (they're huge), the ---- beach, and the ----- thai
The Hail Caesar is an office favorite
Also- try the rice pudding empanadas, YUM!
I have eaten tacos across this great city of ours and this place hands down is the best
Best value and best taste
If I am even close to 19th street I always stop by for at least one taco
But as always one is never enough
The burrito's are huge and dont fall apart when you eat them
And to top it off the staff is as nice as they come
Do not believe the previous comment about high prices
Where else in NYC can yound $2-6 mexican food, this place rocks!!!!! Really good food and really nice employees
To me that isn't expensive but then again i was born here and I am used to our prices
I've been going to this restaurant for years and have never had a bad experience
It's a great place to bring adventurous out-of-towners to show off New York City
It's also a great place to bring friends for a calm, relaxing, and delicious meal
I almost always order the mazza
It's a lot of food that just keeps coming
Salam is a place to go for incredibly good food, wine, middle eastern decor and respite from the hustling world of New York
Don't expect a rushed experience
We had a beautful time, from the pouring of the hot mint tea, through grape leaves, chicken ouzi and turkish coffee
Try a Lebanese wine called Les Bretchens
Something special
This restaurant is absolutely delicious, and the decor resembles an authentic harem
And the best part is, nobody has heard of it, so there's never a wait, not even on a Saturday night
Try the ouzi, it's particularly sensational! And there's a wonderful room for private parties
I'm a a semi-regular at this place and every time I go, I have a good experience
The ambiance is perfect and I'm always able to get the table tucked away at the corner
The mazza is my favorite
you get to sample different dishes family style
The wait staff can be slow sometimes, but this is the type of place one would go with good friends and/or date--relax, have good conversations and linger over the meal
I have eaten several times at Salam, and on each ocassion have found the food outstanding
I've seen a few comments about slow service and am not sure I understand what the problem is
I always found the staff accomodating and never had any complaints
This place has some of the best baba ghanoush I've ever had
The lamb ouzi is also one of my favorites

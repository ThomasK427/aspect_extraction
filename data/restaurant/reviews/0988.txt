It is just like what everyone else says good food but over-priced
The decor is fabulous but there was only one waiter (maybe because it was late Sunday night??)
Great place to take an out-of-towner or for some client wining and dining
This is definitely the place to take someone you want to impress (preferably a beef eater) but be prepared to shell out the dough
im a out of towner- went to 20 diff sushi places during the 2 wks i was here
the kobe is definitely delicouss but the rolls are mediocre
great presentation but i dont know how authentic japanese this place is
if you're entertaining to impress this is the place to be
if not save your money and buy yourself somethign nice
I went with 4 of my girlfriends for dinner on a Saturday and had a great time
The cocktail list is awesome! Try the rasberry mojito and the Maiko
The space is beautiful and certainly a place that deserves wearing your trendiest outfit
The food was ok
Don't get the three tier raw bar
There was hardly anything on it except shaved ice
1 part shellfish and 1000 part ice
The kobe steak is worth trying as well as the seared foie gras
The sushi rolls are above average and received a wow from a couple people at the table
Make certain when you go that you're not in a rush because the ambience is perfect for a mellow night of dining and also
because the service is below average
Our waiter didn't really know the menu and was not attentive
I live around the corner and stop in at least once a week
I love sushi and can't bring myself to eat cheap fish (it's true what they say
you just can't go back)
I'm also a big fan of the chicken pizza on their new bar menu (no bread - weird, huh?)
Everyone thinks you need a black amex and a reservation to eat at MEGU, but that's just a rumor
MEGU is a great people-watching destination for all styles
I always see celebrities and the staff is really friendly
It's easy to keep the bill low, you just need to know how and where to order (the secret: start with the bar)
The food at Megu is really inventive and delicious
For starters, they have one of the most comprehensive menus of any restaurant I've ever been in
Everything seemed like a specialty
I'm not big on raw fish or sushi, so I always go for beef or chicken
This time I had kobe beef skewers, it was absolutely delicious
Great cocktails too! I'll definitely be back and highly recommend Megu
After all the hype surrounding Megu, my boyfriend and I decided to finally go here
We made reservations about an hour before going there for an early dinner
Our waiter was nice and offered many helpful suggestions
To start we got the tajima sashimi, kobe beef filet, two foie gras teriyaki skewers (best foie gras in the city), okaki, miso soup, two bowls of platinum rice (rice cooked in Evian) and kobe beef foie gras croquettes
For the main meal we ordered kobe beef short ribs and the tatsuta fried chicken
Everything was superb
The only issue was the time it took for everything to come out
Sometimes we'd wait 40 minutes for just one dish and the next we'd have 4 things arriving at once
It got annoying but overall it was an excellent meal
The final price was around $350 (with 4 drinks) after tip
After reading all the mixed reviews for this place, I wasn't sure if I'd end up loving or hating Megu
We were with someone who was very familiar with the menu so he helped us pick the dishes
All of the small plates were very good, both presentation and quality
The fish was extremely fresh
Deserts were amazing as well
The service was great; the waiters were very attentive and friendly
they made us feel as if we were the only ones in the restaurant
I will definitely go to this place again
The food is AMAZING! I'd heard a lot about MEGu before dining there the first time, like it was too expensive, but I found it to be a good value
I've been back several times
The best sushi I've ever had, but they have so much more than that, like the steaks
It really is inventive Japanese cuisine
Sure there are some pricy dishes on the menu, but you get what you pay for! They have a lounge menu too, very inexpensive with some yummy bites! I'm gonna be a regular! Delicious!
(must be way passed the opening hype bc its was only half full)
As a Japanese food connoisseur, my wife and I ordered simple to test the quality-sashimi sampler, four handrolls and miso soup (and a very good sparkling sake)
The waiter made a huge production over what order he should deliver the food, as we all agreed the miso should be eaten with the sushi to aid digestion
The food was medicore at best (soggy handrolls), and the miso NEVER CAME! After all that, the waiter tried to backpedal saying its too hard to time the cooking of miso soup with the sushi bar offerings
Basically, he just forgot and made a million and one bad excuses
Food was not good enough to carry the bad service-WILL NOT GO BACK!!
I thought this place was going to replace my favorite Japanese restaurant but after eating here half a dozen times I'm convinced that it will never be what I expected
The quality is never the same as it seems to fluctuate after every visit
The service is laughable since it's comprised of inexperienced leftovers who just don't fit the Asian vibe of authenticity that the cuisine demands
Even the managers are seemingly useless
I asked one of the more elderly managers what we were eating and he joked that he didn't really know so he referred someone else to us who basically repeated what was written in the menu
Completely useless!   Also, while we were having dessert a cockroach crawled across the the wall behind my wife's head
It was so disgusting we had to leave immedietly
We'll never eat here again
I spent about a month looking for a place to have a cocktail party for 100 people
Everything I found was closed-off and stuffy - or WAY over-priced for what you get
I thought Megu would be out of my price range, but they were able to work with me
The bartenders and servers were really fun and very personable
They added something to the ambiance
My friends and colleagues didn't want to go home (so the tab stayed open!)
We had a raw bar, sushi, and passed apps that included all of my personable favorites (crispy asparagus on sticks and spicey fried shrimp - to die for!)
Per person it was cheaper than dinner and yet we were there for over three hours
We left full (and drunk) and everyone was talking about going back
Megu saved me
I'd tell my friends, but they all saw for themselves
I went to Megu three times in two weeks
It is the best sushi I can get outside of Okinawa or anywhere in Japan
I had 2 celebratory dinners there and one for business
The toro impressed my guests as much as the decor
However, the service is a bit lacking
Wait staff are not too attentive and they can surely perfect their Japanese a bit more
I am looking foward to my next visit, hopefully very soon
Having heard (and read) about how expensive Megu was, I was pleasantly surprised by the $35 prix fixe 4-course (salad, soup, sushi, dessert) lunch
Having lived in Asia 16 years, mostly in Japan, I know good sushi; this was outstanding quality and value, particularly the hirame and mirugai
My colleague equally enjoy his Kobe beef burger
Encouraged, I went back for dinner and was again impressed: crisp, spicy asparagus spears (tad too spicy?), silky chu toro avocado ravioli, and tasty wasabi soy beef skewers
But the standout was the poached miso-marinated spanish mackeral with parsley pesto - moist, garlicky perfection
Service was friendly and informed, and while there were some pricey items on the menu, we ate very well for under $100 pp (incl
couple of glasses of wine each)
Bottom line: food you can't find elsewhere at a surprisingly reasonable tariff
Architecturally stunning, Megu is curiously cozy
The greeting area is separate from the dining room, cutting down on distractions/extraneous noise

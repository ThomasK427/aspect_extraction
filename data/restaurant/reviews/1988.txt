There is quite a bit of parking available in the area so it makes it very easy to get there
It is definitely a restaurant that you want to keep going back to
A keeper!
A friend of mine and I recently stumbled into restaurant about five months agao, and had no idea what to expect
It looked very warm, spacious and inviting from outside and we felt compelled to check it out
The low lighting and mellow music makes it the pefect setting for a business lunch or or romatinc date
The food was absolutely incredible, and the friendly serivice will keep us coming back
We particilarly liked it becasue it is out of the way from the hustle aned busle of traffic and noise
I have been there three times so far, and have always been impressed with the creative menu that never fails to please, comfortable spacious seating and warm glowing atmosphere
You couldn't ask for anything more at these prices!!
Recently my wife and myself had the privilege of dining at this wonderful restuarant
All of the staff were friendly and attentive
They catered to our every need
Everything we ordered was delicious, and the ambiance was conducive to a memorable dining experience
Parking was not a problem and the prices were very reasonable
We can't wait to go back there again!
I entered this restaurant late one night only to ask for a wire hanger
I had locked the keys in my rental car while it was still running!!! The hostess in Oro Blu gave me a hanger immediately and said she would also get someone to help me
I wasn't even a diner! Two seconds later, the restaurant's owner walks me out to my car and tries everything to open the door
Then he gets on his cell phone and calls Hertz to get emergency road assistance (Hertz sucks at this!)
No luck
All of a sudden, he does something to the driver's side door and it OPENS!!! I couldn't believe my luck
What a great guy!! I'm gonna dine there all the time!!
Went on a Friday night and they had a local salsa band playing great music all evening
They also have poets, performances, singers each taking place once a week
Perfect for dates, romantic dinners
But the drinks are a bit pricey
Japanese owned, Spanish cooks, with an Italian cuisine
Strange but what a great turnout!
My boyfriend and I found this Italian gem in Zagat's for Valentine's Day
We enjoyed a 4-course, pre-fixe meal - pretty good deal for $$ (which included a bottle of champagne) and the lobster and calamari with marinara sauce over linguini was excellent - but make a special request to remove lobster shell, which made eating pretty messy (not good if you are playing dress-up)
The only drawbacks were that we 1) the atmosphere wasn't very intimate because of the live band (good jazz, but disruptive) and 2) were unsure who are waiter was, and thus had a little difficulty getting attention to our requests - there was a string of busboys who attended us (and perhaps our waiter?)
Otherwise, we had an excellent time
The neighborhood, albeit quiet, was a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of busy city streets
We love this restaurant
The pre-fix dinner menu is also a great deal! I had the chicken francese and some friends had the pasts and everything was delicios! The tiramisu was out of this world! We didn't waste a single bite
The wine menu was very good, and the service was great
Great for groups!
I went ORO BLU with my friends to have dinner one day, and I had such a great time
Food was delicious, service was perfect and atmosphere was so romantic
I've heard they will have grand opening party for lounge this Friday 25th
You shou go check it out!!
A precious jewel on a relatively quiet street
Oro Blu offers an upscale experience at moderate prices
Service is impeccable, the decor is elegant, the food is top notch and the ambience, though quiet at times, is pleasant, intimate and romantic
The bar offers ENORMOUS, well-mixed drinks at $10 a pop
Perfect venue for private parties or corporate events
Expensive and not worth it for the money that you pay
The soup was way too salty and the bread was hard
The sandwiches are average tasting and once again, very overpriced
Also the staff is not very good at their job
The first time I went they said there was a $5 minimum to charge, which is understandable
The next week they claimed it was $8 and was changed 2 weeks ago
Absurd!
This is an excellent spot to grab lunch for anyone in the neighborhood
There are tables for dining there, but it is loud with constant traffic, so I would recommend grabbing high-quality food to go
The create-your-own salad is a must, and well worth it!
The Scene Set in a dingy, badly lit basement with faux wood-paneling and linoleum accents, an eclectic group of Chinatown explorers--from students to silver-haired baby-boomers--struggle to recapture the authenticity of the restaurant's former incarnation as Vietnam
Servers rush to take orders but aren't very interested in the follow-up
Dishes arrive in haphazard, random order and empty platters overstay their welcome
The Food These Vietnamese dishes are cheap, generously portioned and perfect for sharing, yet truly uneven quality-wise
The kitchen misses with leaden, fried-to-death spring rolls; an ungainly, oily crepe stuffed with bland shrimp; frighteningly undercooked grilled meat balls; and an over-battered soft shell crab
The hits--a perfectly dressed grilled pork and shredded green papaya salad, juicy diced beef with onion on watercress, and an aromatic, fiery and flavorful basil chicken--aren't strong enough to encourage repeat visits
This place was a gem in the beginning, when it was owned and run by Vietnamese people
It is now owned and run by Chinese and it's lost its spark
The food is so-so, but then again, most Vietnamese restaurants on the East Coast are average
Go west
My family have been going there for years
It's our favorite place
Try the curry shrimp or chicken
The Sate is out of this world when it is on and okay the other times
The summer rolls are light and airy and better than any of the other Vietnamese Resturants downtown
The other dishes to try are the lemongrass chicken, or the curry duck soup
The salads are also great
The food is not oily like most vietnamese places but is rich in flavor
Just a good solid resturant with no pretensions
i have been ordering from here since it was called Vietnam
Great place always good food and i am a cook and picky about the restaurants i eat at
I visited 2 weeks ago friday
Had lemongrass chicken, raw spring rolls, papaya salad
Objectively, I gave the food an 8
8 - 9
0
It was outstanding, and when the bill is considered $23 for all (plus 2 desserts) AND 2 beers, it's off the charts
Others may have had bad experiences, but I for one had nothing of the sort
This is just the real thing, and it's very good
The basement setting isn't nearly as dingy as it's made out in the reviews
While reading Z (ratings guide) I came across Doyer's in their book because it's among NYC's highest rated and cheapest restaurants
It CERTAINLY earns RESPECT
I've lived in Thailand and am familiar with cuisine from that region (Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian)
Doyer's is the REAL DEAL
Hey, did you catch the review by the Vietnamese guy? He has nothing but high praise
Every time I go looking for the restaurant, I always forget it's location
I've spent up to 1/2 hour looking
Worth it
This is our favorite NYC Vietnamese Restaurant, a real treat
It is down steep stairs and is busy so the service is not always perfect but we are always quite pleased with it
We find the atmosphere pleasant
This restaurant is our first choice to take friends to in Chinatown
Disregarding the wildly mixed reviews of this restaurant, I went into this basement on Doyers St

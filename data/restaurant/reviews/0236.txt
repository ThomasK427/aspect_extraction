The sea bass was one of the best I've had in the city
The XO shrimp were delicious
The filet mignon was incredibly tender
However, it was very different from a steakhouse steak
It was essentially well-done, but it must have been cooked in a different way than it is at steak houses because it was still very tender
The service was good
I will definitely return to this place
The $20 prix fixe lunch is a wonderful deal
I went to NYC for July 4th Weekend
I had dinner at TAO and it was great! That place is beautiful
The HUGE Budda was incredible to look at
The restaurant was super clean
Staff was friendly and drinks were great
I had the LO MEIN Pork and I've had better
The chicken dumplings were great
I bought the double cd of TAO
Its lounge/house music
The CD is pretty good
I wasn't thrilled with the food but overall this place is great
If you just want to see the place, go! but if you want to eat a good meal, go somewhere else! The Peking duck spring roll had no perking duck inside, the Kong Bao Chicken was as big and as hard as rocks, and salmon was try and tasteless
Being a Chinese and a food lover, all I can say is - Never had such terrible Pan Asian Food before! I highly recommend you go somewhere else to eat
Any asian restaurant in New York city can prepare food better than they do AND you don't have to wait for an hour to be seated
Never written a review before
Went to Tao last Saturday night
Our reservations were for 7:30
Arrived at 7:10, had drinks
At 7:45 started asking questions
Many people that came after us were seated
It was to the point where people having been there only 10 minutes were being seated
We were told that our table had paid their bill but had not gotten up
We were only 3 people
Most of the tables were 4-tops! At 8:15 we were finally seated
I just wanted to sit within a reasonable time after my reservation
Food: mediocre at best
Overrated takeout! We had lobster dumplings - fried dough
Never saw or tasted any seafood! We ordered non-sparkling bottled water
Never saw the bottle, each only had one small glass
Was told that's all it serves
Hmm
Spent well over $100
Not worth the hype!
we took my friend there for her birthday, and we had 10 oclock reservation
we didnt sit for 45 minutes
so we had to stay in the crowded bar/waiting area
not really fun
dinner was good, and the bathroom is nice
the guys there were drunk and crowded the table
the bouncer had to remove a man twice
If you are looking for a nice place to have dinner and relax this is not the place
If you are looking for an overall crazy scene and energy then this is the place to go
My husband and I went to this restaurant on May 20th, 2005
We both had one of the best meals that we have ever had!!!!!! We had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation time, but it was well worth the wait
It was a Friday night, so the lounge area was crowded, but a great atmosphere
I highly recommend the wasabi crusted filet mignon
TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!
Looking for a place to drink and found this very chic, hip bar/restaurant
We did not have the food but it looked great
The drinks were good
I recommend the Tao martini
It was spiritually enlightening
OhmmmmmmmmmMusic great, people watching great and overall very Buddhalicous
Amazing experience, Tao is one of the trendiest, and delicious restuarants in the city
The service is impeccable
I had the strip sirloin which was amazing and already pre-sliced, and a shrimp tempora sushi roll
We sat on the main floor with a view of the large buddha
I highly reccomend that
MY friend had the chilean sea bass, I tried it, and it too was amazing
My recommendation? Go to Tao at least once!!
The owner's first priority is table turnover
It's not sufficient that you actually called and made the reservation for a specific date and time
You need to call back the day of your reservation or risk losing the reservation! If you don't call (just to call their bluff), the hostess will call you and leave a brusque message that you need to call back and confirm, or you'll lose the reservation
Once you're in the restaurant, you'll get your food in five minutes flat
After youve received your fast food, the staff circles you like vultures waiting to grab your plate away at the first sign you might be done--asking to take your plate once it's in mid air
The check is promptly dropped on your table with the credit card receipt including signature line--EVEN BEFORE I GAVE MY CREDIT CARD! Better service at similar prices can be found elsewhere
A friend and I made reservations for 6 PM and were seated promptly
We were escorted to the second floor (where you can still see the head of the largest 2 story buddha you have ever seen)
Our server was prompt, polite and made great recomendations
The creative cuisine and the overall scene make for a great place to hang with your buddies or impress a first date
Expect a loungy, relaxed atomsphere (dimly lit) with a hip twist
Highly recommended
It's hard to find a restaurant as cool as Tao without having to deal with large lines to get in
Definitely don't be late for your reservation, you'll get no sympathy from the full-of-themselves host(ess)
The service is excellent, the food is excellent
Not recommend for large groups, they have one table that can hold 12 people and the wait for the table is 2-3 hours if occupied
I recommend the table in front of the 20 foot Buddha
It's the best table in the house and holds up to 10 comfortably
Book reservations as far out as possible (one month)
It's a loud restaurant, don't come to be to have quiet talk
Tao is way too crowded with mid-town business types and BT folks
There is no room to move and when one is sitting down at a table, the sorrounding humanity, waiting for a seat, causes tension!! The food is great but not unique so why bother? Even the bar is too loud for conversation
I would skip!
Great Atmosphere! Walk in and you feel like you are stepping off the streets into some beautiful peaceful retreat in southeast Asia
MUST have a reservation or you are lucky to even get in the door
Very good menu but VERY dissapointed they changed the beef filet mignon that was originally served on a hot stone and you cook it yourself
to a big pot of scalding water you actually have to dip the raw pieces of meet into
The steam is annoying and they had no comment as to why the menu was changed
Still a great place-decently priced and good atmosphere
Tao is always a great dining experience
It is always busy but if you have a reservation you are set
the restaurant itself is fantastically decorated

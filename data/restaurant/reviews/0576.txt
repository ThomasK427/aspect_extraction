debated posting this review because i want to keep it my secret spot!
The Scene  With flickering sconces and rough-hewn brick walls, Crispo may look like an elegantly restored Italian farmhouse, but frenzied servers, tight tables and wait-list hopefuls at the marble bar make it feel like a city-slick hotspot
In season, solace-seekers retreat to street-front patio dining, while foodies observe the kitchen through a wide window in the white-tile back wall
The Food  Frank Crispo's confident cooking drives this imaginative Italian menu
Start with prosciutto di San Daniele and peaches enlivened with tangy drizzles of aged balsamico, or braised baby artichokes offset with slivers of toasted almonds and parmigiano
Homemade pastas are emphatically flavored, so half portions suffice
Crabmeat agnolotti is sweet with carrot-butter; sausage orecchiette robust with broccoli rabe
Grilled mustard-glazed salmon with smoky pancetta slaw and tender veal medallions with fontina and mushrooms in a marsala reduction are heavenly followed by creamy buttermilk panna cotta or homemade gelato
My boyfriend and I always go to Crispo
We love it! The food is great, especially the carbonara and if you like spicy, the orecchiette
Crispo is aperfect combination of great food, sophistication, and neighborhood comfort
They have the best chicken in the city and their tomatoes are the freshest and incredibly flavorful
Highly recommended for dates, casual dinners, parties, or just about any occasion
The salad and cheese plate were decent, but the pasta and service were terrible
The papardelle were overcooked and tasteless
The waiter couldn't recommend a wine or pasta after we asked him, and the restaurant serves wine in tiny glasses
And the cars buzzing by on 14th street does not create the most serene atmosphere
Also, incredibly overpriced
The best italian restaurant in NYC
My experince is like fairt tale
This is Italy
Don't waste your time walking through Little Italy and come here
The food is delicious, service is great and overall impression is just lovely
I recommend reservation
You have to check this out
I recently dined here for the third time
Have loved the food, ambiance and wine list
However after the last visit I would be foolish to go back
The staff acted as if they were doing us a favor by showing up
Service was slow (an hour between finished entree and dessert menu) and snippy
( If you're not my waiter than who are you and why have you been taking my orders and bringing me food???)
I get the message- won't be back
Very disappointed in the service
Waitress did not have knowledge of what the dishes were
Felt very rushed by all staff members
The worst part was the manager didn't care to better the situation for us at all
I always thought that you went to a restautrant not only for the food but the ambience as well
Bottom line is I will never eat at this restaurant again, nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone
It doesn't matter how the food may taste if the service stinks it ruins the experience
Made a reservation last night to sit in the garden
Have been here 5-6 times before, but this was my first time outside
All I can say is it's one of the nicest al fresco spots in Manhattan, they must have spent a fortune on this patio
As always the food, service, ambience were all excellent
This place keeps getting better and better
Go!
The food here is very good and reasonably priced
The only issue is the service, which remains challenged, and where waits between courses can be quite long
Management should take note- your formula almost works, and would be perfect if the service got up to snuff
A cold reception got even colder when we didn't have a reservation for a Tuesday night (the place was half empty)
Our hostess gruffly sent us to our table where an over-zealous waiter explained EVERY special in detail (all 10) and made snide comments when asked for an explanation of a menu item
(didn't realize we were within ear shot)
Despite bringing the wrong appetizer, the food was tatsy
Not over the top, but good nonetheless
No attention was paid during our meal, excpet when we were asked twice if we wanted another bottle of wine for dessert
The check was average, but picked up and wisked away before I could say I didn't need change
Not a word of thanks or a how was your meal
If there were a next time, I'd stop to let them know how my meal was
Sadly, that day will never come
Food is simple and pretty good
Somethings are not to miss
(Octopus salad ; Pear Carpaccio with gorganzola and prosciutto; Lamb Chops ) Consistent
Not gourmet but damn tasty!  Service is back and forth
There are waiters who are a familar face every time I go which has been on and off for two years now
They are excellent! One or two servers who were really bad!!! Pray that you get one of the excellent ones and your night will be fun and enjoyable
Decor is simple
There are so many themes going on I don't quite get it
I just sat in the new garden and its like I was in the Italian Countryside
My only negatives are these
The host can be short
They overbook and you wait
(Only on weekends) It gets really crowded
Cocktail drinks tend to sometimes take a long time
Its simple
I took two out of town guests to Crispo on Saturday night because I had read a good review
After we sat down, I soon wished we had gone somewhere else
It was 20 minutes before anyone even greeted us at the table, and when our waiter approached, his pompous attitude was overwhelming
The relationship with our table was borderline hostile! He didn't want to answer any questions, and it seemed like he didn't want to serve us at all
With all the restaurants in New York, why go somewhere to be insulted
And the place wasn't even crowded at the time! I called the manager the next day, and he offered nothing
TERRIBLE
Food was pretty good, but far from mindblowing
Nothing I'll remember
Go someplace else if you like to enjoy yourself while you eat
I was expecting to get a bit more harrassed, based on the reviews here, but I thought they were on the right side of the pushy/attentive dichotomy
Crispo needs to lay off the salt
It also got pretty loud as the evening wore on
Fine, but I wont be going back
First things first, the food is fantastic
I've seen some reviews about long waits, but I had a Thursday night reservation recently and we were seated right on time, and our waitress was extremely pleasant, if only moderately attentive
The torta melanzane appetizer was AWESOME
We made our reservation two weeks in advance and confirmed the day of
We ran into traffic on the way down and called to say that we would be 10 minutes late
Upon arriving I told them that our party was complete
After WAITING ONE HOUR and being told that our table was on dessert 3 times, I inquired as to how much longer the wait would be
I was told that since we were late (10 minutes) and our party had been incomplete (?) it would be at least another HALF-HOUR
A 1 hour wait with a reservation is unacceptable
I suggested that they pick up a round of drinks, since we had been waiting so long
I was told that Crispo felt that they were under no such obligation to do so
We left
We were treated with rudeness and disrespect

Highly recommended establishment taht could only use a couple more broads to even it out
Excellent value for your money
Seafood appetizer was super! The filet mignon was excellent
Good service
Great dining experience overall
has the best sushi around
(Voted NJ best of state) A must for sushi lovers
The lobster salad and spice tuna is legendary
the sushi chef is reowned
It's isn't cheap, but then again, great food shouldn't be
Say hi to Charles
and enjoy!  Zagat viewed
This place is a bit of a surprise - an old fashioned luncheonette with a Chinese food menu
There must be some magic performed by the kitchen
The appetizers came out only seconds after we ordered and were freshly made for us
The food was much better than average, but definitely save room for the homemade ice cream
That was the real highlight and the only relic of the deli that survived the transition to Chinese food
If you like cookies and great Italian pasteries, come here!!!! AMAZING!!!
If your looking for a resonably priced Pizza Reasturant,with Fantastic Pizza's and speciality items,This is the place
Homemade soups made fresh daily,with many Italian specials added to the menu daily
If you like homemade Italian Foods then this is definetly the place
Free local delivery and Fax orders taken
Catering is also available at a very affordable price and highly recomended
Napoli has very good pizza
The delivery was fast and courteous and the pizza was a great blend of flavor
Not flimsy, not too thick
Not too heavy on any one ingredient
Charlie the bartender makes a great Bloody Mary
Friday nights they have a young lady singing in the lounge who is spectacular in talent and appearance
Sit, listen, dance, sing along
it makes for a great night
Wish I knew her name (and phone number)
Party of four and not a single complaint about the food
Generous portions without being overdone
This is absolutely a good times go to place
If you are not careful, it could become your hangout!
In Short Festive decor of colorfully tiled tables, vintage photographs and sunny Southwestern accents welcomes an all-ages crowd at this informal hangout
Youngsters and their parents pile into dining room booths; casual business types toss back margaritas and watch televised sports at the bar
The menu features mild versions of Lone Star state favorites, from double-basted baby back ribs and steak fajitas to red-beef chili and deep-fried onions
The buffalo chiciken was terrible but the rest uf my family liked it
The only thing that was good was the chips it was'nt surprising
On the border right next door is much much better
I never want to go back again to chili's again
The kids menu was fine usualy like every other kids menu
This restaurant is delicious
I highly recommend the steak fajitas with the salsa
The chips are ok but with the salsa, it is very good
Basically the salsa makes almost everything
The service is average and the ambience is good
If you love mexican food, then this restaurant is perfect for you, don't forget the salsa!
The chips , salsa and steak fajitas were the best ever and really tender food!!!!!!!!!Everybody, would love it really much that they will want to go there every few days nothing is bad about the service in fact I've seen so many people go there, it's a good thing
That is the best mexican restaurant ever
I'm going to go there again for sure
The prices are a little high (entrees $20-25), but the quality is definitely worth it
The meats are amazing
I had the veal prepared with sherry and chopped almond sauce -- it was soft and flavorful
Someone else had the special rib eyed steak also very tastefully prepared and soft
Another had the tenderloin cut-- it was like butter
the meat melted right in your mouth
Each entree was served with a large side of delicious Spanish rice, veggies, and homemade Spanish french-fries
We also had an order of the clams casino and an order of escargots
Although both appetizer selections were delicious, however to save money I suggest sticking with just the entrees
The portions are large and plentiful
The Sangria was refreshing but I definitely had better
If you are cost conscious, it is the best choice from the drink menu
A large pitcher is about $21
You don't need to go to Newark to enjoy the finest Spanish cusine in North Jersey
El Cid is wonderful in all capacities
huge portions, wonderfully seasoned food, tasty sangria, and relatively inexpensive
I have been there with family, friends, and on romantic dates
great for any occassion and I have yet to be dissapointed in the quality of the food or it's service
Garlic afficionados will fall in love with the flavor of all of El Cid's dishes
This place has huge portions and great sangria pitchers
The prices are reasonable and the service is pretty good
The menu is spanish and has a ton of great choices
I have not been disappointed yet
Best Pizza in Paramus, much better than King, and Clemenza !
Can't find better pizza
Service is great
Great Soups and pasta as well
You can't go wrong with La Bella Roma
Jingle Inn has the best selection we've seen in a Japanese/sushi restaurant and we've been to all the best ones in Northern NJ
Great place for groups/kids as there's something for everyone
Make sure you try the Jingle II roll - spicy tuna on the inside w/ hot grilled eel on the outside
The Maryland Crabcake roll is good too if you are not into raw fish
Can't wait to try their new place Koi in Englewood
The wife and I have been going there for the last year and outside the city it is the best place to have great sushi for a good price
Sit by the bar and have a conversation with the owner and chef
I've eaten at Sanducci's any number of times, and bring out-of-town guests here regularly
The food is good and the portions are large--and at some point we always realize that we've outstayed all the other patrons
There's always a wait, because this is a great neighborhood place
My wife and I have gone here for years and it remains one of our favorites
The food and setting is very nice
I will admit the waiters can seem at times a bit pre-occupied but the food is teriffic
I went to Nanni's for the first time for my birhtday dinner
We had 8:00 reservations and were not seating until 9:00
during that time, we were left to stand in a smoky bar/walkway without any acknowledgement or when we were going to be seating
Once seated, the host did not even apologize
The waiter was odd, he would not make eye contact even while telling us his specials, instead he kept glancing around the room
We left there very upset

The hamburger/ice cream chain is very much similiar to that of Serendipity, only less expensive and the portions come smaller
And they probably recieved quicker and far more organized service
Yes, and we all know, because it's on the UES, why not serve caviar as well? the Caviar Burger
And any fanny-packed idiot looking for some intelligent lunch
Don't even think so
For starters, caviar tastes so bland and doesn't even accompany anything, except for cristal
which also tastes so bland
There
A perfect match!
I went to this place once a few months ago :had a bad experience
A friend of mine came in from out of town and begged me to go after seeing it on Oprah
Never one to disapoint a friend, i went
AGAIN, the experience was awful, i just had to write and let everyone know
Food is bad, expensive and not fresh
Service is awful also
The frozen hot chocolate is good but just a blown up expensive version of wendy's frosty
go there, save yourself the money and aggravation
Service is probably better there anyway
After reading all the negative comments, I was a little concerned but after having a wonderful experience at lunch today, not sure what they are talking about! We had stopped in an hour before our reservation time and we told they could seat us immediately
Our waiter was friendly and attentive
Everyone in my party was pleased with their meals
We split the frozen hot choclate and it was amazing! This is not to be missed!
TRY THE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!! It comes in a pretty big serving
You can also get a mix of the stuff to go (but I'm sure they make it better)
I will be going there again!
I am a visitor to NY and was looking forward to enjoying dessert at this spot
Dessert was great, but the rude staff ruined my whole experience
The wait on a Sunday afternoon was 1
5 to 2 hours
The staff act like customers are an inconvenience, instead of having a good attitude and customer service
They yelled at me for not being there when my name was called
And told me to get out of their way
When I called to make a reservation, the women who answered the phone was rude and hung up on me before taking our name
I called on the day of to make sure they actually had the reservation, and was berated for calling
The waiter took my boyfriend's order, snatched away the menus and stormed away from the table without even looking at me
There is something seriously wrong with the people who work here and whoever allows them to act like that
Also, at around 9pm, while we were dining, there were about 8-10 empty tables downstairs while dozens of people waited outside
Very peculiar
I took a date for some dessert
We're waiting for 40 minutes and a girl walks up to him to check in
The host goes to seat her and my date knew she signed in after we did so she stopped him and said We've been waiting much longer
The host, whose job is to manage customers, immediately snapped
They were only here 5 minutes before you
That's definately not 'much'
He came back and started harassing us all the way to the table at high volume in front of all the other customers
Embarassing! He had such an attitude! I complained to the manager and he refused to do anything
Forget about a free ice cream, this guy was ready to kick us out for getting in the way of his revenue
We left, furious, and on the way out, the host wanted to fight with me
Unheard of
i called to make a reservation
and i'm sweet as pie
and all i got was a nasty attitude from whomever happened to pick up the phone that day
the joint is way too crowded, service is bunk and the staff is anything but friendy
and i'm really upset about the nasty man on the phone
ok for a sweet tooth, but you could def def do better
It is not a bad place to have these monster deserts, however from making reservations, they are rude and the actual service is slow
They are not in any hurry and seems they could give a rats but_
If you have to wait an hour, LEAVE!!!!
it is definitely overrated! the place is small, and stuffy
the setting is nothing special
the food was pretty good
the thumbs up - huge and delicious deserts
but we waiting two hours to get it (we had reservations but it was late so we wanted to try to come in earlier)
bottom line, the deserts are great but not worth the hype around the place
This place is not worth the money
Their is the attitude that since they were on Oprah that customers should be thankful to be allowed to come into their establishment
I know places that we could get better service and better Ice Cream
It is a very small place and the service stinks!
A group of us went to celebrate my friends birthday last night
What a nightmare
We told the staff we would be 5 minutes late and were told our table would be given away, when a few minutes earlier another staff member said we have 15 minutes to get there
The staff was RUDE
This place provides ZERO customer service
Not worth the wait or abuse at all
Our napkins and flatware were tossed on the table, our waiter spilled vinegar on my friends hair
I am surprised Oprah would receommend such an unfriendly place
When we went to purchase the hot chocolate mix we were repremanded for touching the merchandise
What a way to sell your most famous product
God forbid there is a fire in there
There are mobs of people waiting and crowding the front door
Once was enough, never again
The staff is terrible
They could really care less if you were there or not
The host was extremely rude
The servers were rude as well and service was pretty much non existent, just plop your dessert on the table and then you never see them again
The frozen hot chocolate was definitely not memorable and neither was the hot coffee that was served cold
Totally overpriced and totally not worth it
Don't go and waste your money, there's plenty of nice dessert places in NYC
Also, as another reviewer said, the A/C barely works at all so if you go be prepared to sweat throughout your meal
Well, after seeing a lot about this restaurant (even on the Oprah show) I decided to go there and see
Unfortunately, the food is awful, the staff really doesnt care about you, and the frozen hot chocolate is just a chocolate milkshake (it wasnt all that great) I went before lunch on a Thursday and it took me 2 hours to get in
By the way, I order a cheeseburger which for 13 dollars was really small
The place looks ok, but not nicely decorated
If you go during the summer be ready to sweat because the AC seems to be really low
As a New Yorker, and a regular at Serendipity's, I find the sourgrape reviews incredible
The Food, as well as desserts, is wonderful and served in abundant portions (and worth the prices)
Reservations are possible - Call a week in advance, for dinner -not just desserts
My party is always greeted warmly and the service is cordial
My children are now bringing my grandchildren and we all agree that it is just as good today as it was 20 years ago
The only problems that I sometimes see are with the guests who rudely make demands of the staff, most of whom are trying to please everybody all night and day long! I could never do what they do, or put up with the grind that goes with working in such a busy place

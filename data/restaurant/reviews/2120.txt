$7 margaritas guaranteed to do the trick
Free chips with very tasty cilantro-y salsa as well as guacamole salsa
I ordered the cheese enchiladas
I think they were good but after two margaritas
I admit it's kinda up in the air
My friend got the chicken chimichangas
He enjoyed but then he also had the tasty
and toxic margaritas
Good ambience for a Mexican place
We spent A LOT of $$$ on drinks while waiting for our table and an hour later they said we would have to wait another hour (after they talked about us as if we weren't standing there) I will NEVER go back there
El Rio Grande has very inconsiderate bartenders that treated us very poorly
I would never recommend this place, and I will never go back
I have been going to El Rio for well over ten years and I love this place
The frozen margaritas are excellent and strong
The green tomatilla sauce that is offered free at the table is DELICIOUS and not offered at any other Mexican restaurant I know of in NY
I always get and share the steak nachos and the stuffed jalapenos (stuffed with big shrimp and jack cheese)

delicious classics
Don't forget to jazz up your steak nachos with the relish tray
Then for dinner I like the biztec mexicano medium rare
Wrap it up in one of their delicious flour tortillas and you are in business
If you can stand it, finish up your meal with the banana pinata
Mmmm
I hope they never change a thing and stay around for at least another 10 years
The steak nachos are the most pleasant way to start off any meal
Follow those up with a couple 'ritas and you will be singing and dancing yourself down 3rd Ave
Excellent bartender mixed scrumptious margaritas
Interesting bison with wings suspended from the ceiling
To give the drinks a fair chance I had one mango (delicious but a little sweet for me) followed by two strawberries (JUST RIGHT!) - we also had chips and wings at the bar
Perfect blend of well prepared frozen margaritas and great service
I was told that Rio Grande had the strongest Margaritas anywhere and I did not believe it
I learned very quickly (after one) not to doubt the rumors
They are the strongest, best tasting Margaritas in New York City by far!! Be careful, they sneak up on you!!
The Quesediallas here were great, but probably tasted a lot better considering I was sloshed after swigging down two of their famous Margaritas
Look out though, they're great drinks, but ther bill creeps up on you and you'll find yourslef drunkenly convincing your friends to cover your tab
Good bar scene, the waiters left much to be desired
great Mexican
You can make your own spicy salsa, and they ask how you want your meat cooked as opposed to the other mexican places that give everyone the same steak burritos
Nice chill atmosphere, the short wait is enough for a cocktail and the food is worth the wait
Only negative
the wait staff seemed to be in a rush to clear our table
Overall, best Mexican rest
in the city
Well-deserved reputation for the strongest Margaritas on the planet
After three, I couldn't write
Never tried to food, but it's a good place to tie one on before heading out
Had reservations yet waited to be seated for over half an hour, so don't even bother with making a reservation
The service was slow, yet the amazing margaritas make it somewhat worth it
The prices are decent
I recommend starting with the steak nachos with jack cheese
We waited over an hour for a table after being told it would take 30 minutes
If the host would have made a better effort to reset tables after people left, the wait time would have been much shorter
The staff here needs to get a clue
Better yet, the person who manages this place needs to put a little more thought into new hires
In NYC, service can make or break a restaurant
Yes, we NY'ers like good food and ambience, but we are much more likely to return to a place that treats us well
regardless of the other criteria people look for
I went for a work function with about twenty people and we were treated extremely rudely by the staff including the hostess and the waiters
The hostess was unaccomodating even though we were obviously going to spend a lot of money
The food was decent, I had the skirt steak
Not bad
The drinks are a different story
I don't know if there was a communication problem but my friend and I ordered mojitos and the waiter came back with some frozen drink with anise in it
He insisted that it was a mojito and when we argued that mojitos contain mint leaves he very rudely snapped that we were wrong
I will never go back there
This place is great if you are looking for strong margaritas and awesome queso
Not too many places have this Texas delicacy
As for the rest of the food, it is fair
And so is the service
Don't go there if you are in a hurry
But worth the trip
Had dinner at the bar
At the bartender's suggestion, I had the shrimp fajitas (he said the shrimp dishes were the best)
Chased it with two margaritas
All the previous reviews were right: the food is great, and the drinks are powerful
I will definitely be returning
Would've liked to have slightly larger portions
ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PLAN TO HAVE A WHEELCHAIR WAITING FOR YOU UPON EXIT
Although Rio has lost some of the wild abandon from its double-patio-bars of yesteryear
You are likely to find a decent amount of talent - both male and female - milling about on the 38th Street side
Battle your way to key bar space along the Big Buffalo-supervised Margarita Mile and consider pausing for reflection after Rita #2
If you need to use the bathroom, try to plan ahead, as you will often need to step over girls who haven't been pre-warned about the suspiciously strong cocktails
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

This is gem
A great selection of British pub pies, only made the Australian/NZ way - with choice ingredients and expert technique
Even though this is mostly about meat, meat, meat, there're even a few really tasty vegetarian pies too
A little out of the way, but so good
This would make a great choice for your next party
I have not been to the Brooklyn restaurant, but instead ordered some pies as soon as I read about Dub Pies online
They arrived in a temperature controlled shipping box by UPS yesterday and these pies are fabulous
I love the Mince and Cheese - the meat is much higher quality than the usual US Ground Beef and that white cheese gives a great flavor
The Sausage Rolls are also fabulous, and my husband (also a Kiwi) loves the Steak Pie
We've lived in NY for many years and there is nothing like this product available anywhere in the area
We will keep our freezer stocked with these and can't wait to try the Lammingtons
Dub pies are one of the best finds in Brooklyn
They're delicious, feeling and reasonably priced for something so good
I even used them to cater a party of 300 and they made special bite size pies
The Meat pies are great quality - my favorite is the Potato Pie , which is just awesome
easy to use web site and a prompt delivery service
prices are very reasonable and their food is fresh and tasty
highly recommend and if you have never tasted an Aussie meat pie, give these guys a try
you will be addicted,,,
My partner is from Melbourne
Since moving here in 1999, he's been mourning the lack of meat pies
(We'd been making do with pies from Myers of Keswick, which makes a decent pie, but English-style, not Australian)
Dub Pies not only finally brings proper Aussie meat pies to NYC, they do them amazingly well -- the quality is better than any I've actually had in Australia
We buy them by the dozen for Grand Final parties
and -- Dub Pies has LAMINGTONS! if you want an inexpensive taste of Aussie food culture, go here

Go eat pies
The atmosphere is great, the food spectacular, with manti and the swordfish as the stars of the menu
Order a bunch of meze to share and enjoy them while drinking some raki
In a city full of good restaurants, often ruined by snobbish or clueless staff, this one stands out as a warm, friendly, bustling port of call in a somewhat barren and non-descript area best described as Far West Soho
In a room decorated with beautiful Ottoman antiques and artwork you can pick exceptional mezzes (appetizers) from a selection presented by a super-friendly staff or order lip-smacking dishes (especially if you like lamb) from the menu
Wines and cocktails are well above average and the house raki, Turkey's national drink, akin to Greek ouzo or French pastis, is well worth a try
Overall, a purveyor of many-layered pleasures
Very busy on weekend evenings
I read a review about this new place and wanted to give it a try
and it far exceeded my expectations! The decor was great, food absolutely delicious (tapas style), waitstaff patient and prompt, and the whole experience was affordable! I definitely recommend it
Great date, spot, too, since they have a full wine bar! A must try
We will be back!
Fast food joints are a dime a dozen and this one is no different with exception that its been fairly new at Ditmars
The nice thing about this place is that it boasts good delivery times, lots of interior space and clean facilities coupled with TVs around the place
What it lacks is good customer service and good food, which kills any reason to order from here in the first place
Each time I've called to order delivery, I've had rude high school like kids hang up without a thank you or a goodbye
The owner of the joint always looks so unmotivated to be there and seems very standoffish to feedback
Whats interesting is this place is almost always near empty -- it could be the fact that its directly across the street from a gym and healthy restaurants or it could be the terrible lack of professionalism and service at the counter
Recommended only if desperate
We tried this new restaurant for the first time last night, and found it to be excellent
The steak was the best I've had in about six months, and that compares to Ben Benson's, Del Friscos, Smith Wollensky, AND Peter Lugers
Charcuterie Bar, is a decadent pleasure, good sides and starters, and Love the steak sauce freshly prepared table side
BRAVO!
QULAITY MEATS IS BY FAR THE WORST OF THE SMITH AND WOLLESKY RESTURANT GROUP
WE HAD A RESERVATION FOR 5 AT 8, WE WERE SEATED AT 845
THE STEAKS WERE ALL OVER COOOKED, THE SERVICE WAS BAD
WE LEFT THERE LAST NIGHT AND ALL SHARED A PIZZA
SO MANY BETTER CHOICES HERE IN NY
Overall, cool interior design, very solid steaks (try the three filets), and the corn creme brulee and cheesy gnocchi were terrific sides you don't find at any other steakhouses
Service was a bit leisurely, but would definitely would go back
I must have been there on an off night
Below average food, poor service
With all the other steakhouses in the city, what's the point
bring back manhatten ocean club
Didn't know what to expect from this place when my friend suggested it
In general, I think steak is good but all the steakhouses kind of blend together in my experience
Not this place!!! Not only was the steak possibly the best I've *ever* had, but the sides and appetizers were absurdly good (try the gnocchi, marrow, or crab cake)
The atmosphere is incredibly cool and different, not stodgy or testosterone-laden like other steak joints, and my non-steak-eating friends were just as enthusiastic about their meals
It's pricy for sure, but definitely worth it for special occasions
I've caught myself thinking about the corn creme brulee at least three times since I was there
Can't wait for an excuse to go back
While I may have trouble remembering the odd name, Quality Meats was a wonderful experience last night
The salads were a stand out as were the top rate steaks
Order as many sides as you can muster
Corn creme brulee, fries, asparagus and creamed spinach souffle are musts
Try as many desserts as humanly possible
The service was great, the decor was great, the food was great
What more can a diner possibly ask for?
The industrial design for this place was amazing! Very different from anything else uptown
I thought the food was excellent and the desserts were incredible
This place was sexy enough for a date, but laid back enough to go with a bunch of guys
A real winner!
I would not recommend going to this place if you are looking for a good steak
It has a good ambience but that's about it
The service was average
Do not order the three fillets, one steak has a not very tasty sauce, and the other two are barely eatable
i loved our dinner there! we decided to check it out and from the minute you walk in, it's a great experience and atmosphere
the fresh baked bread is amazing
we all had steak, delicious with corn creme brulee! homemade ice creams were offered by the pint, really cool
I rarely venture uptown for dinner, but from the moment I stepped in to Quality Meats, it was certainly worth the trip!! The restaurant is beautiful - every detail attended to
The people working there could not be friendlier and more accomodating from the host, to the bartender to every server
And the food - I am still dreaming of my dinner - a steak prepared three different ways
I could have ordered it all over again! I loved my dining experience at Quality Meats and will certainly be back
Perfecto!!!
Ate at Quality Meats and had an overall fantastic experience
The setting is very cool and seductive (same design team as Public and Stanton Social)
And the food is refined and delicious
Steaks are expertly prepared and the raw bar was fresh and excellent
The sides are wild and amazing - corn creme brulee, creamed spinach souffle, gnocchi and cheese
you get the point
It's a really fun night out (great beer list, too!)
Well worth it, I'm excited to have this one around
Offers great food but not so great service

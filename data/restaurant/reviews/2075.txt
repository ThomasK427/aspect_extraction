I didn't think City Search allowed people to vote more than once a day for Best of but it is obvious that Tanti Baci has figured a way around that
I'm shocked by the glowing recommendations, particularly since this is an area filled with outstanding Italian restaurants, so how does Tanti Baci, which is a mediocre place for a quick meal get noticed this way?  We live around the corner and never go there though we did go shortly after it opened and had food delivered
While it's okay, there's nothing to recommend this restaurant, which is below ground and has no windows - though it now has limited outside seating on Seventh Ave
So
It's got pasta, a few daily specials and I don't want to sound as if you'll hate it, but let's be realistic
What a cozy place and great food! I had a chicken dish instead of pasta and it was wonderful! The bruschetta was yummy and fresh
I also highly recommend the sauteed spinach if you are a fan! Listen carefully to the specials because there are lots and they are all delicious
my friend had homemade pasta with a delicate vodka tamatoe sauce and shrimp and it was incredibly good
I started with a tasty caprese salad and enjoyed a pinot grigio from the extensive wine list
I give the place two enthusiastic thumbs up and can't wait to go back!!!Before I left, I made a reservation for our next visit
This is a decent neighborhood Italian restaurant
Decent pasta at reasonable prices
However, it is not good enough to justify a cab ride
Only stop by if you happen to be in the area, but wait until winter time - THE AIR CONDITIONING DOES NOT WORK
The atmosphere is very cozy but relaxed, with brick walls and dim lights
The food is great, the servings are just the right size, and their olive oil with bread is absolutely delicious! (The sign is easy to miss because the resaurant's entrance is below street level
But when you get there, you'll be glad you did
)
I found this restaurant on citysearch, and decided to check it out with my boyfriend over 4th of July weekend
Let me tell you--we walked in and walked right out
Never mind that the place looks like somebody's old apartment
The menu was not appealing at all
Maybe it would have been good, but not good enough to be an audience winner for Best Italian Food!
If you like sweating off your meal as you eat
this is the place for you
Tanti Baci is in need of a desperate make over (and an air conditioner that works)! I will give credit where it is due
the food is excellent, however, paper napkins, dripping with sweat and no more clams when all I wanted was linguini and clam sauce made for a less than perfect annaversary dinner
P
S
this is the last time I use citysearch to find a romantic setting for dinner
the waitress was the pits
she ran out of the restaurant, accusing us of not covering the bill (at the top of her lungs in the middle of the street), when in the end she counted WRONG! the food is mediocre; the place has no ventilation; it's lit by candlelight not for ambience but to conceal the less than average interior; just don't bother going
Do Not Go There, the food was terrible
You better eat the falafel next door
Make no mistake it is
A DISGRACE!!!
This was a repeat experience for me simply because you can't miss with Tanti Baci
The consistancy of this restaurant is amazing
I took two business clients there yesterday evening and we all left full and satisfied
Take your time when dining at Tanti Baci and order off of the Specials menu
You can't go wrong
Also, save room for dessert
I had the lemon sorbet which had the texture of whipped cream and the flavor of natural lemons
Wonderful end to a fantastic dining experience
really good vegetarian dishes
stir fried tofu in garlic and vegetarian duck were both good
fast delivery
In Short Despite its cheesy name and exterior--neon beer signs and cartoon cacti, suggestive of nothing more than a run-of-the-mill kitschy Ameri-Mexican dive--a peek at the menu reveals a wealth of authentic-style Mexican dishes, such as cold avocado soup, fried pieces of pork with mole sauce, and parchment-cooked lamb
The atmosphere is festive, with weekly events and a nightly happy hour involving cheap tamarind, coconut, and "Hawaiian" margaritas
My husband and I have been going to Burrito Loco every chance we get for seven years
You won't find better Mexican anywhere north of the border
The salsa is homemade and scrumptious (and has a little kick), the margaritas are to die for, and the food is as good as it gets
Nice ambience and excellent, attentive service, too
Make sure you save room for the fried ice cream -- the best ever! My only complaint is that the background music is always way too loud
A minor thing for my favorite restaurant
Finding a quality Mexican restaurant in this city isn't easy
Burrito Loco is that rare exception where you can find outstanding service with quality food
While the restaurant/space itself isn't so great (somewhat cramped cheesy interior, and the name implies its a burrito take-out place), the service and food outway its few cons
The frozen margaritas come in a wide assortment of flavors and they are quite tastey
The guacamole is to die for (and before going there, I didn't even like guacamole!) and they make it right at your table
I highly recommend the fajitas
It has a fun environment but not really a place to go on romantic date, but rather with friends or a 3rd or 4th date type of place
I've been going there regularly for over ten years
It is always excellently prepared, delicious mexican cuisine
The wait staff is forever friendly
and at your table
I do believe I have tried every mexican restaurant in NYC
and I always go back to Burrito Loco, when I want authentic mexican food
If you want REAL mexican dishes
definitely try it out
you will never be disappointed
I have been going to this restaurant for 13 years (go once a month) with my husband
The food is great, drinks are amazing and the service is always fast and friendly
The waiter staff remembers our drinks and our favorite meal
I highly recommend going
The salsa is the best I have had
RECOMMEND HIGHLY GO
With an enormous erray of shooters and mixed drinks on their drink menu, its easy to find ourself and a few friends to drop 200bucks
With smooth music and great waiters all around, the food just seems to taste a little better
For a prearranged group birthday dinner, several friends and I went here a few weeks ago
While I thought that only my meal was disappointing, talking with some of my friends after the fact allowed me to conclude that my experience was not unique
The rice was cold and partially cooked, and the prices were high
Service was dismissive
One of my friends had a quesadilla that was cold, and completely uncooked
You can do far better for Mexican food
This place serves some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life
I went with a group of friends, on a weeknight, for a birthday dinner
The service was slow (if you could find it), the margaritas (while they tasted good) were extremely weak and the food was bad and WAY overpriced
None of the entrees we ordered looked good - mine was a semi-hard, mostly cold block of previously melted cheese
Terrible
Either the rave reviews on here are sponsered by the restaurant, or those people were on something
After walking in the village on a sunday afternoon, we stopped at Burrito Loco because we were in search of good mexican food
We lucked out
Burrito Loco made all of us happy
The food was to brag about and the staff was super firendly
They made us feel right at home
We will surely return
Thanks for making our day
Great and fun place to have a few drinks
The atmosphere is lively and authentic

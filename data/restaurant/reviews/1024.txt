The service was excellent
Kile, our server, and Federico did an excellent job at making sure that everyone was well taken care of
The food was great, as well as the prices
I love the decor of the restaurant-very warm and cozy
I am definitely returning to the Primitivo-right now, my favorite Italian restaurant
I give it a 10 in all the fields
Thanks Primitivo and its staff for making my birthday such a memorable experience
Definitely, a Jewel!- E

I went to this place after a recommendation from this site and I wasn't disappointed
Very tasty homemade pastas, great antipasta apps and exiquisite salads
I go back there again and again
Unfortunately, after a recommendation from a friend, four of us came for the first time to receive the worst service we have ever had in the city
Three of our meals were good, though we waited over an hour for them, but one was cold and unsatisfactory
Since the waiter never returned, we coudn't rectify the problem
I was surprised since the other reviews on this site were so positive
I would not go back
Very good food
Fast service, promptly seated, good bang for you buck
I also choose this restaurant from this website
4
5 out of 5 stars
This restaurant was chosen from this website and a great choice it was
Excellent food and huge portion, superb service and very inexpensive
Will definitely return when in NY
Highly recommend
This is a great place! In the morning it's sunny and alive, at night it's romantic and cozy: perfect for all occasions! The food is delicious and oh my God, sooo cheap! You can't beat the lunch prix fixe, where else can you get app, main course and a drink for $8??? And where else can you get unlimited mimosas??? The staff is sweet and very attentive
I recommend it to all!
This is a lovely, inexpensive spot that has top quality food
The service is always warm and gracious, and the food-to-value ratio can't be beat
It's quiet and homey, and the service is always appropriate
On brunch days--I've become a regular--they offer unlimited mimosas, and they automatically bring you refills
They're great!
Soups are superb
A beautiful room which is not noisy
A great lunch value
Great food
Good service and great bar
Wonderful attention from staff and just a great value in an area where most other restaurants are overpriced
Room is very romantic and wonderfully lit
This place is right on! The food is great, service is getting better and best of all, the value is there
We nned more places like this trendy and comfortable rare find The Rigatoni Pollo Pazzo is wonderful, they have a prix fixe lunch that includes soup or salad, entree and hot or cold beverage for $8, The Sat and Sun brunch for $11 is exceptional, considering they offer unlimited mimosas!! Give me a break, and the food is unbelievable
Great night out at this place
Good mixture of people
Bar and service is good
Perfect place for coctails and a light snack
Highly recommend for a fun night out
Our experience here was so poor
We started with very salty/not well cooked edamame, forced ourselves through some tuna tartare, and didn't even finish the rolls that were unimpressive, had no taste, and were presented with the lack of attention with which they were made
We have had better sushi from supermarkets for sure
It was nice to sit outside but the block was noisy, dirty, and had nothing around it to make the ambience nice
I was embarassed that I made the suggestion!!
Pretty decent sushi for this part of town: decent cuts of fish and some inventive rolls
(Lobster, cilantro, and mango are a good combination
) Standout sake list and service round out the experience
(Just beware of the karaoke if you happen to go late
)  I wouldn't commute from my nabe just for the sushi since there's plenty of good stuff where I come from (the Village), but it's a good bet if you happen to be in the area
Expect to spend about $35-40 for an entree, shared appetizer, and drink
The food and fruits are very freshly prepared
The portion of the food is a lot, but not excessive
I think it is worth every penny to wake up on a weekend morning for such fresh food and nicely brewed coffee
It is a great place for anytime of the day
All breakfast/brunch dishes are great
I like the egg benedict and either the berries or banana walnut french toast!
AWESOME food (try the banana/hazelnut french toast which is to die for!!! or the fish and chips), GREAT service and just a generally cool vibe, Comfort Diner is seriously my fave place to go in NYC
You can choose to sit at the bar or in the main dining room - either way, you won't be dissapointed
Sometimes it gets a bit hectic around lunchtime, but that's just because it's so darn popular
Go around 11:30 or 1:30 when the lunch crowd either isn't there yet or has died down a bit and you'll not only get great food but a server who will have a lot of time to kill spoiling you and giving you friendly, fabulous service
This IS NOT your typical diner, and I mean that in a good way
I've actually been there several times as I live nearby, but other than pretty good pies (with bad coffee), there is nothing approaching special here and the service rather sucks
The worst is the pack 'em in and rotate mentality at lunch
The house policy is no seating until all persons in the party have arrived -- even if that's only 2 people and you're ready to order
Worse yet: rude comments (if you want a casual lunch you came to the wrong place
Go to Melrose Diner or Chat 'n Chew instead
if you are looking for diner food, this may or may not be the place for you
it is a little expensive, but for the most part the food is okay
i go there for lunch since it is convenient
the last time i went, the manager was aweful
i ordered mac and cheese and it looked as aweful as it tasted
he said that was how it always was, which the waiter denied and agreed it looked horrible
then the manager gave us lemon juice instead of ceasar dressing for a ceasar salad which ruined the salad
Nice space, clean, good service, good music and best of all, quality diner food
Excellent sweet potato fries, good burgers and breakfast food that is actually quality
This means lots of fresh fruit on your waffles, not frozen or bottled
Give it a try!
The service is friendly at this Greenwich Village Italian Restaurant however the food is just all right
We ordered the chicken with vegetables that were a little dry
The steak salad that we ordered was undercooked
The place looks pretty however we would most likely not return
My friend and I literally tripped across this place after a day of shopping
We sat outside and enjoyed a wonderful spring afternoon along with some appetizers and amazing wine
Our waitress was beyond pleasant and made sure we could sit back relax and enjoy our surroundings
which by the way is beautiful if you sit out back in their rock patio area! Although it was daylight we both agreed Cascata Cafe would be a great place for a date or night out with friends
The only thing that topped our $20 three course dinner was the beautiful garden
I will certainly be back next time I go back to New York
The table outside in the corner is worth the wait
Stay classy
A Great Place in the heart of the West Village!  My Friends and I went into Cascata because of the heated garden, sitting outside in a beautiful setting(huge fountain/rock garden) sipping on wine when it was 35 outside was glorious
The food was  excellent,big salads,good pasta, and excellent  homemade desserts
The service was very friendly

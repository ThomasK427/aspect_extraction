I came in around 11pm with a group of 5 and was simply blown away by the place
I made a reservation for 10pm to eat in the back VIPs cabanas
we had to pay a little more to be seated back there but it is well worth it! After dinner we continued to stay at our table and acquired bottle service with a bottle of vodka
There was a live dj, which she was amazing
This is definitely a place to go to!! I recommend going on Fridays! Thats when I went
I really had a great time
I will be going back this Friday
Staff was very friendly accomidating
Cocktails were way too sweet and not too good
Not a hot spot at all
Apptzr were nice priced right
Website looks more impressive then actual space
Convenient location to clubs galleries
Wouldn't go again though!
Came to the restaurant with a group of 10 before going to local clubs
Was a bit skeptical about going to a new restaurant and was surprised as service/food/ambience exceeded all expecations
The drink menu was fantastic and our waitress was very helpful and attractice
The setting and service was very accomodating to our group and we all had a great time before going out (some of us even came back after for a post snack)
Overall, a great scene complimented by great food and drink
Would recommend for any size group
This place is bad on every possible level
Do not be fooled by the cool interior setting
The food is absolutely horrendous, the service even worst
The crowd is so trashy and below average, and I think they depend on people coming there after a night out at the clubs
so drunk that they don't know what they are eating
Terrible, just terrible is all I can say
One word: Awful! Slow service, food took forever to arrive, menu is nothing like in their website
Bad experience
With so many places in Manhattan don't even bother going to Pre:Post
I heard the owners of quo nightclub opened this
Carlo , Gary and JE
so I wanted to go check it out
Service was not good!!!
I had a reservation but we sat by the bar for 15 minutes before we were seated
Then we were seated at a large booth and it took the waiter 20 minutes to come back and take our order but I sort of expected that with a new restaurant
Location and vibe in the place top notch
Place is gorgeous!! Food is average but good presentation!! Me and the girls liked it overall
A great spot to scene and be seen!! Defanitely worth checking out!! I will be going back!!!
The strong suit of this place is the decor, alas we was seated and served by some guy who looked like he was out of a seedy 70's porn movie and everything went downhill after
Make sure you eat a burger or something before you go, coz although the food is fresh, the portions are extremely small, more fitted for the anorexic than for anyone who has a regular appetite
The service is slow and rushed (Le Miu somehow managed to juxtapose the 2 service no-nos beautifully)
A desperate Sex and The City chic wanna-be, with the price to match, but ultimately not worth the money
Since when is asking whether one has a reservation a problem? And since when are we not allowed to eat in a restaurant in the east village that doesnt have grafitti on the walls? Quite frankly my fiance and I really enjoyed it
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service
The negative reviews are so predictable
Just because a place is in the East Village, doesn't mean it has to be cheap or easily reserved
The managers aren't snobby for wanting reservations -- it's a new restaurant and they're trying to manage the flow of diners
The manager is actually extremely nice and accomodating; and vested in the experience there
The food absolutely warrants a higher pricetag
It's as creative and well prepared as any i've had in the city recently -- both hot and raw dishes
This restaurant is wonderful
I went there a few days ago with some friends and we had a great time
Everything we ordered was amazing
The freshest fish
it just melted in my mouth
All the specials were just as good, my friend ordered the fried oysters and said they were great as was the tuna carpaccio salad special! I think this restaurant is a great deal
Le Miu is the place to go for wonderful sushi, good service, nice atmosphere and food that tastes great!
What is Le Miu doing in the East Village? I find the attitude of the managers to be appallingly superior, and the food below average, at sky-high prices
My sushi was entirely unmemorable, and the management treated me as if I were second-class
There is so much good food at good value in the East Village - I can't imagine how Le Miu will survive for long
people behind nobu, megu and others
70 seat sushi parlor
First impression: way too snobby for EV
The bartender asked if we had a reservation (no) and then implied that it'd be impossible to get seated without one despite the fact that it was only about 4/5 full
Then he retracted by saying well, tables for 2 are easy to come by
End result -- we sat at the sushi bar, which was actually entertaining because the sushi chefs rule the roost here and take great pride in their work
They are the only reason why I'd give this place another try
The $45 prix fixe is a good value if you want to try a little bit of everything
The food was extremely creative and beautifully presented
The host was also a bit arrogant, but was kind enough to apologize and discount our check for an operational glitch that had people waiting almost half an hour for their food
Great sushi, great atmosphere, great staff
This new East Village Japanese restaurant has all the key components
The food is amazing, presentation extremely artful
Favorite dishes include: Seafood Salad, Tuna Tartare, Osaka style sushi with salmon, sundried tomato and mozzerella, the rock shrimp rool, spider roll, and black angus steak with sesame sauce
The also have a great bar with delicious cocktails, sake, and wine
The icing on the cake is the decor, which includes fantastic lighting, terrific music, and plasma screen tv's which play a fun variety of films to entertain you while you sip on sake and snack on sushi
I totally recommend this place for a night out on Avenue A!
the steak was delicious as well of the crepe of dulce de leche
You can't go wrong
Great wine list and amicable service
We found Buenos Aires las week and we decide to have my birthday at the argentinean restaurant
The customer service is great and my family and I enyoyed the dinner a lot
It was my first time at an argentinean restaurant in NYC
I can tell is really exellent
I discovered the argentinean dulce de leche (caramel) and it is delicious, the steak also
Fair price and nice atmosphere
I had the best ribe eye anywhere, So tasty and the papas provenzal to die
The host very nice and friendly, the waiters too
From now this is my favorite restaurant in NYC
I love argentinean food
The decor very cozzy and nice atmosphere
And by the way the price really inexpensive
Highly recomended for meat lovers and vegetarians too
They have a lot of salads and pasta as fetuccini pesto (really home made)
I am from Argentina and Buenos Aires is an authentic argentinean restaurant
The meat is full of flavor and tender
The caramel panqueque is delicious and the wine list is the best one in Manhattan
In my opinion is the Best argentinean in Manhattan
If you are still looking for argentinean food and the best argentinean wines in NYC you should go to Buenos Aires
Exellent atmosphere and service

Perfect for a date or a family outing
It's at a great location with plenty of bar and lounges nearby to enjoy afterwards
Pizza here is consistently good
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
You should pass on the calamari
It is thick and slightly soggy
Decor is charming
Service is average
I can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks? Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC! Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad
Great staff
Always great service! I go twice a month! Fantastic!
There are way to many moms with kids and strollers here and the food isn't great enough to make it worth it
I also think the space is too small for the type of production they are trying to pull off
I guess the food is ok
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
So eat fast and order a lot
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
Great pizza and fantastic service
There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected
Located at the end of a magnificent block
Very cozy and warm inside
I will be back!
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it
very fortunate, location wise
The pizza was pretty good and huge
The price very reasonable
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion
a bucket of food literally
We got most of it back at home with us
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest
tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne
got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed
lol
The best pizza I've ever had! Friendly, attentive service, nice atmosphere, and generous servings of delicious food
Only complaint: they don't take credit cards
I love Pizza and this is by far the best town to get as close to authentic pizza as possible
Paty's is terriffic, I've been there many times - just an fyi: they don't take credit cards so bring cash - its not too pricey
I've heard that Patsy's and Lombardi's are the best pizza in the city and they're right
It took more than 20 minutes to place our order after we were seated
Then we had to ask the waiter for the soup of the day four times before he came back with the answer
He never brought us water - I had to go downstairs and ask someone else for it
Oh, and he brought the soup with the pizza
The salad and the pizza were good, though
I would go back because it was good, but next time I'll bring my own water
Really great thin crust pizza - hot and fresh and fast, though you'll probably have to wait for a table
It's worth the wait
The place is noisy and crowded
The staff is friendly but seem a little overworked so sometimes you have to ask twice for something but again, that's ok since the pizza is amazing
They do have other dishes
The pastas arriving at nearby tables looked very good
PS You can get pizza to go
Finally a place who knows how to make a pizza! Good sallads, excellent value - now if they could only put some candle light on those tables, they would be making a fortune!
The pizza was some of the best I've had, and believe me, I'm a connoisseur
The freshest basil and the freshest cheese
Too bad all but one of the servers were clueless
We were approached by a total of three waiters
The first mumbled and there was some confussion as to whether we had ordered or not
The second offered to take our order, which we had already placed, but brought us drinks
The third, luckily, was able to correct out drink orders
We got regular instead of diet
Ultimately we were satiated, but patience is required
The Scene You want to resist everything about this place--the silly napkin sculptures, the mirrored walls, the color scheme borrowed from the world's worst wedding halls--but somehow wind up enjoying it all in the end
Part of the charm is in the earnest service; part of it is the colorful clientele; but the real charm comes from what emerges from the kitchen
The Food The classic Italian menu gets off to a good start with Queen's famous bread basket, which is loaded with a slew of crunchy, yeasty homemade varieties
Navigating the dinner choices is easy if you stick to the huge array of specials, which range from homemade lasagna to simple, yet gorgeously grilled meats
Whether it's a half-pound ball of milky fresh mozzarella, a bowl of cushiony gnocchi with peas and mushrooms or tender veal saltimboca, dishes are carefully prepared and presented
Many people seem to think highly of this restaurant, and maybe I just haven't eaten the right things, but I have been disappointed every time
I don't think that the food is all that traditionally Italian to begin with, and many of the seasonings used are combined together quite oddly
I have had dishes poorly cooked on more than one occasion
The wait staff is only mildly polite and all seem to be very sour
I've given up on Queen
The first nice dinner I've had in Brooklyn
I am here for a year and plan to eat my way through Brooklyn Heights during my visit
Nice polite service, adult atmosphere, and perhaps the best Italian food I've had since I came back from Italy
Wonderful flavors, well-presented
Good wine list
Small tables, designed for couples?
It doesn't matter if you order in or eat at the restaurant - the food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS
This is pure, old school Italian food that is so worth every penny
The decor is nothing great to speak of, but who cares - the food is top notch
If you are looking for service and all the frills $$$ - Il Mulino is the best for both - if you are looking for a fabulous dinner in/out - this restaurant is it! I must admit, I am very spoiled by Queen -I get a FABULOUS dinner once a week - delivered to my door, piping hot and absolutely delicious!!! Queen, you are my Italian Gem in Brooklyn!
The ambience is somewhat lacking
The service is good, but the staff is not too friendly
I had the lasagne, which was tasty, a little salty, but good, nonetheless
The cheese ravioli is very good
Overall, the food makes up for what is missing in the ambience and service
A tip for Queens' employees - smile, will you!
Forget the decor, food matters! One of the best Itailan in the city, Queen is worth visiting from Manhattan! Straightfoward, pleasing or whatever you expect from real Italian food
This is Shabu shabu
I am from Japan, went to Ginza to eat shabu shabu all the time
It's worth the price because in Ginza it costs $200!!
I love this place
I have had shabu shabu from tokyo to taiwan to LA to NY
This place stays in true Japanese traditional shabu shabu
For the price you pay, you get good quality and deliciously thin sliced beef
(trust me, i've had it sliced thicker and the taste is completely different

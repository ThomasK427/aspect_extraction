The food
what else is there to be said
excellent!! With all the gushing we were doing,we asked to meet the chef
If you are looking to have a romantic evening, this is the placce! Our trip into the city was all well worth it!
With a dozen reviews within a month, all fairly similar, had to find out if this was friends family, or really special
Truth is, the restaurant which is very attractive is average at best
The menu is extremely limited, with no one dish that would make us come back for a second time
Ambience service was fine, but food was nothing like the glowing reviews
I was told to check out Ribot for Lunch being told it was the new hotspot of Midtown
I brought along my commoradite to check out the new spot
And fell in love, the decor was flawless, Italian with a japanese flair
The food and service were excellent
I had the menu prix fixe which was price at a modest price and we also had a bottle of wine from Ribots impressive wine list
I highly recommend Ribot for your next lunch meeting or after work dinner drinks
I will surely be back again
Wanted to try this place
Good food and good service
the wait staff was on point with service and the food was very good
oftentimes the midtown lunch scene is either too pretentious and expensive OR too casual and quick
not too many options in midtown for an affordable yet above average experience
So, RIBOT is a blessing
great lunch fixe menu
my client was vegetarian and they havd nice dishes for her to choose from
light fare
nice outdoor terrace
not too busy, just right
I just dined at this place based on the other rave recommendations, and had a bad time
There were 4 of us and the waiter messed up the order for 2 of us; then brought out a menu so we could point to what we had ordered
By the time the food came out, the other two had completely finished; and the food wasn't even that good
The service was awkward at best, and the entire experience left me wishing that I hadn't gone
My colleague and I tried them for lunch
Very nice atmosphere
It seems expensive, but seriously it's not
Overall package is very nice
Their lunch prix fixe is a great way to eat
Took my boss out to lunch for his birthday - great place for that! Great Service, quality of food caught us happily by surprise, and a friendly environment
must try, bringing the wife for dinner on the terrace this weekend
We had brunch outside on a saturday and it was great- the food was delicious and the service was very good
Everything from the food to decor was great- I would definitely go back

Had lunch with a colleague at new charming place

Definately going to be one of those hard to get into lunch places soon
Spent most of a beautiful Saturday enjoying the great food and wine on the terrace
The staff is very friendly and our brunch was delicious reasonable
Definitely looking forward to returning
Very nice people working here
I took my wife to dinner for her birthday
The food and service was fantastic
The staff was so kind to us
What a beautiful looking room to sit in

had a good time with my girlfriends
Really great place to eat and have fun with your friends
Beautiful room with beautiful people
And the food is really good
Welcome!!! Glad to see such a nice place with such nice staff that really wants to take care of you without the pretentiousness of midtown
I live in the area and was walking by and noticed this new restaurant
My husband and I stopped by and had dinner
I found out that they just opened two days before and was very suprised because things seemed in order
The food is delicious and atmosphere was beautiful
Had dinner there the other day
Very beautiful room
I believe they just opened
the food and service was quite nice
My friends and I shared some dishes just to try them out
Jumbo shrimp raviolis were spectacular
Lobster spaghetti were also a big hit
the manager said that they were just starting with a preview menu
just a 'teaser'
Well I can't wait to try the regular menu!! There is also a beautiful chandelier to look at
There was a large section in the newspaper introducing this place so my bf and I decided to check it out
The place is tiny so we decided to sit outside
Why, it was even worse outside
The view was a dirty wall with graffiti and instead of romantic lighting they had these bright lights that made you feel you were being interrogated by detectives
The restaurant was understaffed and the waiter messed up 3 times with our order, not to mention it took him around 20 minutes to take our order
Now food
We ordered the ground veal and it was incredibly dry and tasteless
Mashed potatoes was watery and the spinach (side order) tasted like it was marinated in lemon juice for years
Everything we ordered sucked but we still hoped our assortment dish would be alright
We waited and waited, thinking the best comes last
It turned out the waiter forgot to write it down
so we never got the dish
What a joke, we had waited so long at the restaurant that we had no energy to complain to the waiter manager
All we could do was laugh
Cute, friendly restaurant with some incredible food
The leg of lamb is a favorite, as is the octopus appetiser
Eaten there three times, and quality of the food is consistent
BYOB and cash only
Great restaurant for a casual night out
Good portions; you won't leave hungry
Went to Elios last night before BAM
Service was warm and friendly, and the meze was really delicious
Highly recommend the veal meatballs
Very reasonably priced, BYOB

Delicious meal, owner Peter greeted every table, I felt like I was at a small-town restaurant but I was really on the UWS! Portions are good-sized since you've filled up on the delicious bread!!!
In Short The fairy-tale Central Park backdrop and the lush private garden, filled with illuminated trees and Chinese lanterns, are the real draw here, particularly in warmer months
Menu items include rack of lamb, veal and various seafood dishes, as well as starters like shrimp cocktail, caviar and chilled artichokes
I have aways wanted to go to Tavern On the Green ever since I was younger
My husband and I went a few months ago for our anniversary and it was horrible!!! For starters, the table was terrible, so close to another couple, I was actually close to the womens elbow! The other tables were emtpy the whole night so we could of sat there
The service was horrible, I still can not believe it!! I had to get up 3 times to find the waiter to ask for water!! We got one drink each and they tried to charge us for 2 drinks each
I had to get up to look for the waiter for coffee and our check!! The waiter acted like I bothered him and was rude and never, ever nice to us
I regret not asking for the manager at the time
I called the next day to complain and the manager said Things like that do not happen in our restaurant
He didnt' believe me!! And it was super expensive for the worse anniversary ever!!! I still am so upset about it and worse when I watch tv talk shows and they have wedding there, I feel like you have to be someone to get treated good
I am glad that other people had a nice time, but, we had the worse time ever!!!
I finally got to have dinner here
I loved every bit of it too
The place is so pretty (in a classic kind of way), the service is A+, and the food was delicious
It's right in Central Park too, and looks so pretty from a distance in the dark
There are tons of other places to go, but this is a must see
and experience at least once
Let me start with a little rant
If you notice, most of negative reviews are from tourists who for some reason discovered that (gasp), dining out in NYC can be expensive
Who knew, right? The comments about the 20% tip, for example show how little some know about nicer restos in NYC, and are laughable
In fact, the only thing I DONT like about TOTG is the fact that too often it is overrun by improperly dressed tourists wearing jeans and T-shirts or shorts
Dont get me wrong; I am not an idiot - and routinely offer my help to out-of-towners that I see struggling with subway maps etc
, but tourists that bash wonderful places like TOTG out of sheer ignorance bothers me! Rant over
review below
Thank you for bearing with me
Tavern on The Green is fantastic
The ambience is beautiful and historic, and the food is very, very good, and not at all expensive for what you are getting
Let me repeat that
not at all expensive for what you are getting
Soup will be $10-$12, Entrees will be $22 - $40, Filet Mignon probably about $35 -$40
This is NOT expensive for a premier and famous restaurant in NYC
This is not Johnny Rockets
I recommend the crystal room, and do make sure you tour the outdoor areas before you leave
Another good tip is to have a pre-dinner drink at the bar
Most dont realize TOTG has a bar, and it is charmingly old fashioned and nice
I only have two complaints about TOTG
1) I do agree with some that the gift shop is a bit tacky
I think the incremental income the gift shop brings in probably will not offset the revenue lost by people who shun the place thinking the gift shop is tacky
2) Some nights TOTG is overrun by improperly dressed tourists wearing jeans and T-shirts or even shorts
Unbelieveable!
If you don't know what this term means, you will after you visit Tavern on the Green aka Ripoff in Central Park
I have lived in New York for less than a year but gone to many Must Go To restaraunts
I heard that the food and ambience was worth the visit, however, my boyfriend and I went on my Bday and were totally disgusted by the fact that this place had a GIFT SHOP, BALLOONS, and a PHOTOGRAPHER trying to sell rollercoaster type photos
it's really ashame this one has the central park as it's property
This landmark is worth jogging by in the park and that's about it
Food is average and extremely overpriced, environment is distracting and tacky
Ate with a big party - not sure if snobby/poor service is the norm in NY but this place stinks
The food was OK, and the view nice, but the waiters are rude, the prices are a little high, and I don't like 20% tips being added after such poor service
Go somewhere else
Took my mother there for dinner
WAY OVER PRICED
A half a head of lettuce was $11
00!!! Food was good on the other hand, had seafood ling, very fresh, nice overall
Price is just a tourist trap
You can get the same food in nyc for much less
Overall nice time!
Last spring I visited Tavern on the Green as a first time visitor to NYC
I was pleasantly pleased by the service, food, and atmosphere at this quaint resturant
It definately lives up to its reputation! I was surprised to find all the negative reviews online and I wonder on what day and time of day these people went and whether they are sure they were describing the same resturant??!! I am planning on returning to NYC in May and you can be sure that I will be visiting the Tavern again! (This time without those ugly orange flags obscuring my view of Central Park!)
The decor has not changed at all since I went for my sister's 16th birthday in 1984
The hall way entrance to the dining room is enclosed with 70's style mirrors
The carpeting was old and there was a musty smell of grandma's house in the air
The worst part of the night was the photographer
She approached our table kindly requesting to take our picture for a photograph wall of guests
She came back an hour later with a cheesy framed picture of us and then ASKED HOW MANY WE WANTED TO BUY AT $25
00 a piece! The service okay but had trouble finding our waiter for a drink refill
Finally we paid our $200+ bill and went to get our coats to be greeted by a line of 25 people at the coat check
They charge a $1
00/coat upfront
Went here for restaurant week, what a bad choice
The food wasnt even decent
Atleast the dessert was good
But the decor is amazing
we are moving away from the city and decided we couldn't leave without trying Tavern on the Green
The coat check girl was a little rude but otherwise we had great service
We were seated promptly and had a wonderful view of the park
We couldn't have asked for a better wait staff, if anything they were too attentive
I ordered poorly and didn't enjoy my meal
I don't recommend the frittata
I nibbled on my husband's meal though and thoroughly enjoyed it
The chocolate pecan tart was delicious and more than made up for my entree
The decor is worn and needs to be updated, I was more disappointed in the topiaries though
They're fake! I was so disillusioned
All in all it was a fun lunch and I'm glad we went
Oh, it was also much cheaper than I expected
I had been looking forward to lunch at Tavern on the Green when we flew to New York from California
We were seated promptly, but the good experience ended there
After 10 minutes I got up to ask for water
After 20 minutes I got up to ask for a menu
When our waiter finally came to the table he was stuffy and rude
The food was mediocre at best
For the cost of the lunch I expected much better service
I get better service at McDonalds
At least there you get what you pay for
If you appreciate delicious fine dining served by arrogant grumpy wait staff this place is for you
My party felt like we got put in a dining room for tourist, which must have been the penalty box area for the disgruntled wait staff on duty
Everything from coat check, being seated promptly to the wonderfully delicious food was excellent
Best prime rib and the Price Fix menu is a great value
I honestly feel like I'm dining in the Pennsylvania Poconos circa 1990
Seriously

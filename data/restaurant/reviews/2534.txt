Zocalo may not be the most beautiful, but it is the most fun and Julian Medina's food will grow into the finest Mexican in NY
No doubt
What a great new chef- the food is light and modern, not at all the typical Mexican food Americans are used to
Every dish is well balanced and the fish dishes especially good- a trio of ceviche, great whole snapper
Service is good and the drinks great too
Just went to Zocalo with a group and enjoyed a wonderful meal
We were seated immediately and ordered some delicious margaritas
Try the white peach or pomigranite which were awesome
The chips and salsa are some of the best around and definitely order the guacamole because it is killer
The entrees were good but the portions were small considering the prices so be sure to order an extra appetizer if you are hungry
Desserts were also good but not great
All in all a great mexican restaurant in NYC
Great new Chef from Maya and Pampano
Zocalo is the best Mexican Restaurant in New York
Have a Silver Coin Margarita, they are fantastic
I went and was extremely disappointed
I love Mexican food, which this place claims to be but isn't
I'm from Calif and I know good Mexican food, this place was horrible
I had the Halibut Tacos, and thought the fish was bad, only to find out that it was the way it was prepared that was horrible
The salsa and chips were ok, but not worth the torment my stomach went through for trying out this place
Eat at your own risk
The hostess at Zocalo deserves mention
She is beautiful, kind and keeps the whole place together
She is a pretty asian chick, I don't know her name
The bartenders are also great, the waiters are ok
The food however, is very good
The guacamole is great
West Coast good
This is the most decent mexican I have had in NYC since moving from SF
Cheers
By far the best mexican food I have had in the city
The tequilla selection is enormous and the ambiance is authentic
This is a must see restaurant for mexican cuisine lovers
I eat Mexican food all the time and coming from the West coast there really isnt Mexican food here like over there
But i have to admit Zocalo is very good
The drinks are STRONG and YUMMY! The chips and salsa is awesome and the food EXCELLENT!!! i have been there many times and will go back!
I went with my boyfriend on a Sunday night
The salsa was one of of the best I've had
We then ordered a pork fluta appetizer
fantastic smoky flavored tender meat surrounded by crisp non oily fried tortilla topped with fresh salsa and homemade guacamole
It was delicious
My boyfriend ordered the steak special for the night
It smelled so good when it got to the table
Everybody was looking to see what he ordered
It was probably one of the best steaks he ever had
It was tender and the marinade was flavorful and out of this world
I order a spicy shrimp plate with rice and it was also very good
Not impressive but it had nice flavor
The waiter was friendly and ethustiac and also helped my boyfriend pick the great entre
Only disappointed with the Margaritas we ordered on the rocks
Otherwise we loved the place!
The Scene If you've frequented Zabars on the Upper West Side, you know that the quarters can be tight
At Eli's, that problem has been solved
Two levels of space with beautifully presented food make this shopping experience feel almost suburban
The Goods Enter through the flower shop, packed with Technicolor stems from all over the world
A flat fee of $35 allows you to take your pick from gorgeous vase arrangements
A trip down the escalator brings you to the produce section, where veggies are displayed like gems
There's a great selection of ready-made food here, much of which is available in the attached cafe
Blond-wood bookshelves span the perimeter of the store and house imported pastas, truffles and, upstairs, the baked goods
If you're looking for a food item of the highest quality, chances are you'll find it here
On 7/13/06 I pick up a package of refrig
blintzes for $7
99
Others charge $4
59 for the same item, but this is Eli's, you expect to pay more
Bring it home, heat it up for dinner and take one taste and we notice it's spoiled
Call Eli's that night and a guy name Chu says no problem, return the packaging and receipt when you can
We were away for a week and on 7/26 I go to the store with receipt and packaging for an exchange
I pick up 2 packages and a manager name Michael and I notice they were moldy also
He says they have been having these problems with this product
It's getting close to dinner time and I said just give me my $7
99 back
Michael said we can't do that
You only get a store credit
I said you guys already ruined one of my dinners, I come back and I am more than happy to use store credit but the product I want to buy once again is moldy, I have lost my appetite for this place, I paid cash, have the store receipt and original packaging and just want my money back
He said that is not store policy and he will not make an exception
This is a store that prides themselves on quality and customer service, they charge 50-75% more than other stores for the same or similar products and they won't give me my money back
The next day I call the store and speak with Ross, the head manager
He said you do not get cash back, only store credit
I will never, ever go to this store again
Any other food store would have given me my cash back, but not at Eli's
They repeatedly sell moldy and spoiled food and won't give cash back on a cash purchase
Shame on Eli Zabar, owner of Eli's and his entire staff
Some of the user reviews on this site complain about the prices at Eli's
You know what? You get what you pay for
If you can't deal, go to the Food Emporium and stop complaining
I thought the prices at Eli's were perfectly fair and not much different from Citarella
Maybe marginally higher, but then I think Eli's is a nicer store than Citarella, so I'm not going to split hairs about it being a touch more expensive
The store, by the way, is incredibly spacious and relaxing to shop in
Everything they sell is superior quality
The only thing that didn't impress me was the fish
Decent, but nothing great
I guess with Rosedale's and Citarella right near by they figured why bother
Although you can find obscure items, heirloom tomtoes, handmade Kosher Matza, exotic fruits and custom-butchered meats, you WILL PAY DEARLY for all items here
This is one of the only places that carries Green Black Organic Chocolates, though - so we forgive
The fresh florist in the front of the store is also EXCELLENT (and, of course, pricey)
They had fresh, sweet smelling stick and English Freesia - straight from heaven
$5 for an apple, $3
50 for an orange, I'm going to the green market! Worst customer service even Eli himself was arrogant rude
I stopped in for a quick meal with my date and shared the mussels in red sauce (a nice portion) a cobb salad and a salad nicoise

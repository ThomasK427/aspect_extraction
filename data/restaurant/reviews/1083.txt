The waiter apologized for the disaster in the kitchen but the management could've cared less
all too willing to blame it on the wait staff
DON'T BOTHER, lament the loss of Grange Hall instead
The atmosphere is beyond wonderful, just as the staff are professional, attentive without being pushy
After three visits I'm confident in saying that the food is great and worth every penny
And to top it all off, it's such a warm and romantic place that my hubby and I decided to have our wedding reception at the Blue Mill
It was a smash hit with all our guests and a truly magical place to celebrate
Try the beet and grapefruit salad, the pork chops, and do not miss the succotash
It's a bit hard to find the place, but well worth it
mapQuest before you go and you'll arrive early enough start off at the bar with a fabulous old school cocktail
The Blue Mill is a great New York art deco treasure
My lover and I had tried this restaurant for dinner one night
Thought the interior decor was very trendy for the neighborhood
The crowd was surprisingly older
Happily, we were able to sit next to each other in a booth
Our waiter was very nice and accomodating to us
I ordered the duck which is my favorite dish but it came out partly overcooked
The pork chops were good but small
Overall, nice place but food not worth the prices charged
So not on our short list of places to revisit
Took my wife to the Blue Mill for dinner and drinks
She couldn't have enjoyed it more
The staff was friendly and attentive
The drinks were tasty and served with style
The food was great
Save room for desert!  We can't wait to go back
My friends and I had a wonderful experience at the Blue Mill Tavern
We started off with some spectacular 1940's style cocktails, followed by a fabulous cheese fondue
The entrees we selected were the prime rib, salmon, ravioli and the Waldorf salad
All were perfectly prepared and delivered promptly
The chocolate cake melted in my mouth
I would recommend this establishment to anyone
I'm looking forward to going back for more mint juleps and Harlem cocktails
I made a reservation for 15 for Sunday brunch, for my birthday, but 20 showed up, not all at the same time
The staff was totally accomodating, not a whiff of attitude, and the food was great
Thank you - I had a great time
After multiple mistakes with securing a reservation, our party of 9 arrived at Blue Mill
We were seated in an awkward area in the middle of the restaurant
We waited 30 mins for the waiter to appear
In the middle of taking our orders, his cell phone rang - and he answered it! I wish I was kidding, but I'm not
We again waited a long time for our food to come out
Three people in our party got the wrong orders and had to wait even longer while they fixed the mix-up in the kitchen
The food was alright, but certainly not stellar enough to overcome the horrendous service
After we ate, we were pretty much rushed out of the restaurant without even a goodbye or thank you from waiter or host - which was fine by me since I have nothing positive to say about Blue Mill Tavern
Saw ad for $5 burger, so was thrown when we found out the prices were, shall we say, pretty pricey
Ex: their blue plate special was $23
Where I come from, the blue plate is $6
$23 is NOT a special price in my book, however, the food IS EXCELLENT
The meatloaf is to die for! BUT STAY AWAY FROM DESSERTS
NOT worth it AT ALL
The cakes were VERY VERY DRY and bordering on tasteless, except for the frostings
Cocktails, VERY FUN, but pricey
Their website says they serve cocktails plus a little extra in the shaker which didn't happen
Their 2 popovers for $7: PURE INSANITY
Just bring your credit card or a couple hundred in cash (literally) if you have a party of 3 or 4
We just returned from an unforgettable evening at the Blue Mill Tavern
My friend and I were on double-blind dates so we got there early and had some tastey old school cocktails at the deco bar
The bartender let us taste a few different 40's drinks and we setted on Old Fashioneds (4 of them!)
They were nice enough to give us a booth in the corner and we ate like the Rat Pack (who were singing to us all night) -- prime rib, scallops, even mac N cheese
And a knock you out chocolate cake to finish up
The blind dates were duds but we'll be back soon -- its hard to find so do some mapping!
Commerce Street is such a unique, little block in the west village
I am so glad I found the Blue Mill tavern
The interior is laid back, relaxed but elegant
A great piece of history as well
A good time for dinner and cocktails!
The experience was creepy and bizarre
The food was okay, but the atmosphere was strangely hostile and manic
A shame
We just got back from a terrific dinner at the Blue Mill
We had scallops as well as the prime rib with sides of the scallop potatos and creamed spinach
The prime rib was as good as any steak house in the city and the scallops where some of the best I have ever had
The x-mas music in the backround along with the bar decor made me think I was in a great movie with New York as the backdrop
The staff was gracious and efficient
A definate must, if you want a great dinner at a great price
Immediately upon entering the Blue Mill, I knew I was in for a great night
The environment is reminiscent of a romantic, 1940s big band restaurant
We had a short wait, but had the fortunate alternative of sitting at the bar where I ordered a wonderfully made old-fashioned
The bartender was particularly friendly and personable
After being sat for dinner, we enjoyed the fresh bread and butter before the salad and main course
Overall, the food matched my expectations
The real value, however, is in the overall experience of eating at the Blue Mill
Although I was faithful to the Grange Hall, I couldn't have asked for a better alternative
This restaurant is a must!
What a great find! Although I was disappointed to see Grange Hall leave
the Blue Mill has given the West Village not only a neighborhood secret (like GH) BUT also fabulous food!!!! (and delicious margaritas!)
Drinks are served club service, which my boyfriend seemed to enjoy
not very often do you get to pour your own drinks! We started the night with crabcakes and ended with pork chops and yummy ravioli
Seemed as if there was something for everyone--without getting too fancy
Same for the service
the staff and bartenders are very friendly and attentive
Maybe its the music or the whole 40's atmosphere, but everyone around us looked as if they were having a great time! My only complaint would be that they do not take reservations for small parties
But if you have to wait, at least the bar is just as fun!
Located on the corner of the horse shoe shaped and incredibly serene Commerce Street, The Blue Mill is a restaurant with a 1930's retro (and I believe original) decor, eager and friendly servers, club style cocktails and a truely wonderful chocolate cake dessert
Approximate price for an appetizer, entree, alcoholic beverage, dessert and tip was about $60
00 per person
I consider that to be more than fair considering that the overall experience was a pleasant one
The Scene Bare brick walls, rough wood beams and a profusion of windows create an airy oasis during earlier hours; as evening wears on, the dining rooms fill with a swankier cocktail crowd
Service is casual and friendly, but expect follies even during less busy times
The Food The snacky Italian menu is full of crowd pleasers, the best of which are the wood-fired pizzas: thin, charred crusts topped with seared wild mushrooms and truffle oil, or pancetta and radicchio

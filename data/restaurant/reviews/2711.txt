! I ordered the plain pizza (just crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and a few leaves of basil), and got half of it topped with mushrooms
The crust was absolutely perfect - thin, crispy-chewy, soaked with the tangy-fresh tomato juice, scattered with charred slices of mozzarella topped with the fragrant leaves of basil
Service was decent, and the waiter was actually friendly (surprise, surprise)
If I lived in NYC, I'd go back every week
MUCH better than Lombardi's and John's - save your pocket change for Grimaldi's!
having been a new yorker all my life (mind its only been 22 yrs!) i'm fnally starting to discover the the charm and beauty across the river
grimaldi's was a perfect inception into this whole new unventured territory! the wait wasn't too bad, had my girls w/ me
after stuffing ourselves w/ 2 pies antipasto a stroll down the waterfront was sweened by a stop the ice-cream factory
They truly have amazing pizza
Good prices, decent service, and great food
but I go at off-times, which means I don't wait in line forever
Be warned that dining here can mean waiting out front in line before getting a table
I know there's supposed to be like this big debate over who has the best pizza (john's, lombardi's, or grimaldi's) but it really isn't too big a debate to me
john's CLEARLY loses
their pizza is horrible
and lombardi's while quite good, still isn't QUITE as good as grimaldi's
I've eaten at all three places many times, and grimaldi's is, hands down, the winner ever time
just getting a plain pizza at grimaldi's is better than a decked out one elsewhere
the servers are pretty to-the-point and not excessively friendly
but the pizza is why you're there
superb pies, brooklyn atmosphere, good music
This is the true, old fashioned pizza place
don't expect to be kissed, be fun ::))))))
After a LONG walk across the bridge, we settled down for an authentic Brooklyn pie
We were not disappointed
The pizza was simply fantastic
maybe a bit too fantastic
We took the subway back into Manhattan
The service was
well, it was Brooklyn
Highly recommended if you're willing to make the trek
Without doubt, THE most overrated pizza joint around
Morons stand in line waiting up to 45 minutes just to get in! I WAS ONE OF THOSE MORONS! I thought I was in for a treat
But the pizza was bland and unmemorable
I was incredibly disappointed
Don't waste your time
If you want really good brick oven pizza, try Romano's on 13th Ave and 72nd street in Brooklyn
Try a pie with olives, pepperoni and hot cherry peppers
You'll forget about Grimaldi's
And there's no line that keeps you waiting like a dog
(Also try Krispy Pizza right across the street from Romano's
The best JOE BROOKLYN pizza in Brooklyn
Unfortunately the best part of the pizza is the crust
Topping sauce is watered down
Place is noisy and tables are placed too close to one another
No Italian atmosphere whatsoever
Prices are outrageous
Give me Old Forge, Pennsylvania pizza anyday- now that's pizza!
The best pizza in new york, hands down
I've tried them all: John's, Patsy's, Lombardi's, Angelo's, etc
; none of them compare
The mozzarella is so fresh and the crust is chewy, crunchy, and light
While this place is outta the way for most, you have to go there
As a long-time Manhattan resident, I say Grimaldi's makes the best pizza in NYC
Good root beer, too
this place sucked! my neighborhood pizzeria is better
Servers are rude as hell and the pizza is tough, bland and burnt, would not recommend it and don't know what the hype is all about
Go to john's or lombardi's much, much better
absolutely the BEST pizza in NYC - or anywhere
The original (no matter what anyone else tells you)
Definitely worth the trip over the Brooklyn Bridge
If I had to choose a last meal, it would be a Grimaldi Pie
You can't beat it - even in NYC!   Of course, they use ONLY FRESH ingrediants, and you can totally taste it
Here's how they do it
it's simple - now pay attention:  fresh dough fresh mozzarella (a must!) fresh home-made tomato sauce with chunks of awesome tomatoes fire it all up in a brick oven
You can get some awesome toppings (my favorite is the pepperoni), but as with any top notch pizza, you don't need any!  Indulge yourself at this place
And remember, it's all about the pizza!
This is by far the best pizza I have ever had
The crust was thin and crunchy,the toppings were fresh and plentiful
The service was outstanding!! The atmosphere was fabulous
Simply the BEST
I have lived in NY and Italy for most of my life, and I have to say this is my favorite pizza
The only people who complain about it seem to prefer thick-crust
In my opinion, it beats out Lombardis and all the others
The first time I went, I was with a Chicago native who was prepared to hate it, and he was speechless
Heard all about it went last week
What a disappointment! The pizza was fair--Lombardi's is much better as, of course, is John's
Ben's in Soho is first-rate, although not thin-crust
We consider ourselves pizza lovers in NYC and we have found that Grimaldi's is by far the best in the city - Years ago we liked John's but we have found their pizza to be just average since our discovery of Grimaldi's
The pizza is awesome - but try the calzone
Delicious and big anough to feed a family
The ATM is now located right inside the front door
As a life long New yorker, I have tried pizza all over the city and Grimaldies is the best
I live in bayside, Queens and have been going to eat there for 15 yrs
The freshest ingredients for pizza on the planet
No one could speak once the pies were served
Highly recommend the garlic onion pie
The crust is sheer heaven
so thin and perfect
There is nothing like Grimaldis
if only I had one in Wichita!
PIZZA
BROOKLYN
UNDER THE BRIDGE
THHHHHHEEEEE BBBBEEEEEESSSSSSTTT!!!!!!! WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE THE PIZZA
Worth the trip over the bridge, worth the search for parking, worth the wait for a table at dinner time and worthy of a ten rating
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIVE IN NEW YORK
THE BEST PIZZA ANYWHERE AT ANY PRICE
This is a great to find the perfect pizza pie
Lots of cheese and sauce, a match made in heaven

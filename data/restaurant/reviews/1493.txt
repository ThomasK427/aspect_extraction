One of the best (and most authentic) French restaurants I've been to in years
Completely charming, good service, and amazing food - I definitely recommend their prix fixe brunch, it's delicious! Great addition to the neighborhood
I am a big fan of the Craft empire and have been looking forward to experiencing CraftSteak
And what a wonderful evening it was
The dining room is beautiful with a wonderful painting in the center of the room, huge windows and enough room between tables that you actually cant hear what guests are saying at the next table
Yes, this restaurant is IN NYC! The food was great start to finish
The waiter, Chris, did an outstanding job providing suggestions and just being attentive
If you like great steak and atmosphere
Dont miss it
And for the record Adam Platt at New York magazine
You were SO Wrong
But then again, you usually are
Ate at Craftsteak last night
The place is huge and stylish, in a great trendy neighborhood
My companion and I had the kumomoto oysters and the sweetbreads for appetizers, both delicious
The sweetbreads were tender, large, and perfectly cooked
Then came the cow
After endless deliberation, we chose a Hawaiian Grass-Fed Ribeye and a 42-day Ridgefield Farm Corn-Fed Premium Hereford Beef New York Strip (Dry-Aged In-House)
I mean, come on, how pretentios is that? Anyway, we would have forgiven the annoying headlines if these slabs of beef had any taste, but they didn't
The grass-fed beef tasted too much like grass
And the 42-day strip tasted a day too old
I ate no more than a few bites of my steak
The wild mushroom mix and fava beans, though, were good
So all you vegetarians with fat wallets out there, rejoice
I would write a whole review here, but Frank Bruni said it all
Too many hardly distinct choices, steak so pricey its quality is an obligation rather than a joy
Fair meat, but not even close to other, experienced steakhouses (we had the porterhouse)
It was fine
The SERVICE itself was not bad, per se
But I kept getting in trouble for checking my watch
I mean, it took FOREVER
Sides were fine
Typical mega restaurant
Good choices, good intentions, cafeteria style execution
See: Tao, Morimoto, Del Posto, etc
Good wine list
nice to see the Gigondas getting some street cred
Overall
entirely overpriced
Not because was expensive (which it is), only because it is expensive for the quality
I had dinner with eight people at Craftsteak last night
we did the tasting menu and were regaled with one wonderful taste after another for over three hours
The waitstaff was extremely attentive (we had three, sometimes four people servicing our table) and the food was delicious from start to finish
In addition, we were recommended several fantastic bottles of wine
Special praise goes to the incredible Weygu beef and the amazing deserts
Thanks Craftsteak!
The dining room is lovely
Service impeccable
And the food lives up to Mr
Coliccho standards
I didn't particular like the Hawaiin grass fed steak (not soft enough) but my dining companions were fans
We had great sides (mushrooms and asparagus) and terrific wines
Our only complaint- we wanted a cheese course!
Lovely, comfortable atmosphere; Great service; Very good food
(We only had 1 complaint: The lazy/inept Manager: see below)
Anyway
the menu and flavors range from exciting/interesting to traditional - something for everyone
We 'experienced' the menu by trying several different courses (we were extravagant)
The Best: the veggies, fois gras, sashimi, smoked trout were all perfection! The steaks were unbelievably tender, cooked perfectly and very flavorful without being salty (but
they had all rested too long = felt a bit too cool)
The Not so Good: The lobster bisque
although others recommend it - we thought it tasted like a bowl of creme with lobster in it)
All in all
we all want to go back and experience the rest of the menu!   Our only complaint was the inept/lazy Manager: We had a very loud group of 'cocktailed' women seated near us
All 5 tables around them repeatedly complained (including us) and requested that the manager kindly do something or move us - the manager ignored all of us - and did nothing! So 1 by 1 each group left (including us) some very unhappy
HOWEVER, we decided to not let anything/anyone put a damper on what had been a delightful and lovely evening
Went to the Las vegas one and loved it
This one in NY is just as great
Steak was the best I've ever had and I've tried a ton of upscale steakhouses
At our table, we ordered the porterhouse (which came with a huge bone w/ bone marrow!), the filet, and NY Strip
All excellent
Lobster bisque was the best ever
served in the most unique way, too
Check out their menu online
it says it all
Nothing was overly seasoned at all
ANd the wine selection was very respectable
Deserts were phenomenal, too
We had rhubarb ice cream (came in 3 scoops), baked alaska (yum), and something else i forgot
Only con was the 2ndary waiter dripped a bit of red wine on my guest's sleeve! BUT the main waiter quickly returned with a dry cleaning voucher and a complimentary dish of gourmet cookies
But they should have presented the voucher in a discreet private way instead of making my guest feel cheap if he were to take it
Anyway, food was amazing, the clientele were very attractive and dressed the part, even for a tuesday evening
Must try it out
You won't regret it
Man was our dinner great
First the setting is mind blowing,40 foot floor to ceiling windows
A gorgeous bar with an awe inspiring wine cellar behind it
Now for the food
The lobster bisque was the best I have ever had, items from the raw bar were beyond fresh!!! The steaks take Craftsteak into the next stratsophere
The Hawiian grass fedd ribeye was to die for
My friends 42 day dry aged strip was on the next level of perfection
The service was kind and gracious
Except to drop some coin, but the prices are the same as other top tier restaurants in the city
We will be back!!!!
We decided to skip appetizers and order steaks and sides for the table to share
After 40 minutes, with only bread and drinks, our wailter told us the food would be right out
Forty minutes later he told us we were the next ticket
With the 9pm reservation, the thought of eating a steak at 11pm was less inviting than the door
We asked for the check
The manager then came over, gave my husband his card and told him to call him

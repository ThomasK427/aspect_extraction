Service, however, was *completely abysmal*; we left very disappointed
Had to ask for bread after main course was served despite all other tables having it before any food served
Had to ask 3 times for coffee refill
Waitron attempted to suck up at end w/ 2 free glasses of port wine, but not enough
Would not go again
Overpriced, VERY cramped and steaks are mediocre
Spend a few extra bucks and get a real steak at Smith W or Lugars
The food was divine, my steak cooked perfectly, the foie gras was great and the apple tart was like buttah
We did wait 10-15 minutes after our reservation time, but that is to be expected at a packed restaurant on a Thursday night
Of course if you're looking for a nice, quiet place without crowds or a wait then this is not for you
If you, on the other hand dine to enjoy good food, then you'll love Les Halles
I will definitely recommend it
I was looking forward to eating here but the service was lousy and the food at best bad
The steak was tough the terrine bland
The place was a zoo so loud i struggled to hear my dining partners
If you want bad steaks go to tads
The best thing was a badly served 1993 Pommard premier cru at a reasonable $59 served in $3 paris goblet glasses
This place has no class
I am a chef a restauranteur there are so many better places to eat for $50 a head in this city
They also had the nerve to add a 20% tip for a party of 5 i normally tip higher than this for good service which this was definatly not
Les Halles looks like a nice French bistro
However, when I was there for a friend's birthday dinner recently, it was nothing short of a nightmare
Sure, on a Friday night, I expect a restaurant like this to be crowded, but
this place was packed to the point of no movement
My party arrived on time and still had to wait 45 minutes--with a reservation! The bar was so crowded there was no point in ordering a drink, and when we were finally seated we got no service at all for 20 minutes
So, after numerous attempts to let the staff know we existed, we left
Thanks for nothing, Les Halles
I am so impressed by Les Halles
My friends and I are real foodies, so finding a good place is something we get very excited about
The escargot was the best I've ever had
We also had the duck confit: delicious and surprisingly NOT greasy! I had the Choucroute Garnie which was so delicious, despite the enormous portion, I ate it all
You'd be hard up to find a more authentic, more traditional, more delicious, French bistro outside of Paris, that doesn't focus on 'fancy,' it just focuses on QUALITY
Wonderful wine list and when our server found out it was my birthday, we got a comped chocolate dessert sampling! I will definitely go back
And believe me, I'd wait an hour to eat here again
Can't speak for the other dishes, but the mussels mariniere and the steak frites were awesome and a great value
We went on a busy night and didn't wait at all to be seated, though the seating is totally cramped in some areas
One of the best meals I have ever had!!! I am a student at the proclaimed CIA and know a thing or two about food
I went to Les Halles ready to knock it down, thinking it was just pumped up do to Bourdain's success with books and tv
Well, I have to say I was VERY VERY happy
I can even comment on the butter
AWESOME! I wonder if they use butter from Normandy
I would have been happy just eating the bread and butter
Got the mussle app and had a great steak
The fries were also excellent
Only con is how close the tables are to one another
WOW! My first visit to Les Halles was AMAZING, but I thought maybe I was a little starry eyed
WRONG! My second visit to Les Halles was twice as nice
I keep looking for something to be wrong, so I can be a fraco-basher, but I CAN'T
The service was amazing again
The food was amazing again
I'm sorry to see so many people who have had bad reservations or some other mishaps, but none for me
Reservation honored
Seated promptly
Food was great
Price was decent
Going back again next week
I had dinner in this cramped bistro last night
My party was seated 45 minutes late with absolutely no regard for our reservation
The food and service following our seating were acceptable, but the place really is a glorified steak frites restaurant
nothing special and no incredible atmosphere to justify paying $25 for a mediocre cut of meat
Coming from France, the land of many culinary delights, but living in New York, I am always excited to go out to a French restaurant, to go back to my roots and enjoy food from the motherland
Unfortunately, Les Halles did not even come close to living up to my expectations
The place was horrendously overcrowded on a Friday night and the food was way below even an average rating
Everybody at our table was unimpressed with their meal: my steak was decent but the Bearnaise was overly buttery and the cassoulet was dripping with grease - my sister gave up on eating it after a couple of unappetizing moutfuls
The onion soup was the only mildly enjoyable thing about the meal
I will be sure to steer clear of this establishment when making future dinner plans and so should anyone who reads this
i went to 'les halles' on friday night
we had made a reervation but we still had to wait 10 minutes, and we got a really bad table
i ordered the cassoulet - my first mouthful was pure gristle, and the rest of the dish was awful
the beans were swimming in grease, the meat wasn't tasty
the other 5 people i ate with also had bad food
no-one finished their dish
it got really crowded, they kept turning up the music and i couldn't hear what anyone was saying
my worst new york restaurant experience yet
Busy Saturday night
Only a 15 minute wait
We stood by the butcher case and looked over the menu
I looked up and saw a huge cockroach climbing up the wall
I pointed it out to the hostess who looked at it and said, yes
Decided if cockroaches are such an acceptable part of the place, I'd rather eat somewhere else
The food is solid as long as you stick to the meats: Tuna was overdone (what do you expect from a meat place, anyway?)
Steak frites were excellent
Foie gras appetizer was silky and delicious
Duck confit melted in our mouths
Steak tartare was the star, one of the best traditional renditions we've had
This place is dark, dingy and smoky - very much like my experiences in Parisienne bistros of the same calibre
The service was, generally, attentive and our waiter was kind enough to recommend us away from the bottle of wine we had originally picked, and referred a pleasant, comparably-priced substitute
We were seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time but there was enough room to grab a few seats at the bar while we waited
In all, a cozy evening with good eats, but we reeked of smoke practically the entire weekend to follow
We (husband, a somewhat belligerent teenage son and me) discovered Les Halles two years during spring break vacation
We all loved the ambience and the food
Our son didn't mine being seen with us at this restaurant
Though the restaurant was busy at lunch, we were greeted with smiles and attention; the wait wasn't extraordinarily long
During later visits to New York we found it was a restaurant we all could agree on (even our teenage son)
This past August we dropped our son off at college, we had dinner there on a Friday evening
We didn't have reservations, but didn't feel forgotten by the wait staff
After reading the books of Anthony Bourdain I was expecting something of a much better quality than this chewy full of nerves pan fried foie gras, this dry overcooked daurade accompanied with vegetables swimming in oil, or this tarte aux pommes whose soggy puff pastry was covered with barely cooked apples and lying in a bath of syrup
No need to mention the disorganised and rude service
Holy Carnivores Batman! This place gets an A+ for a simply splendid menu, they've got everything
As far as the complaints here regarding the service, while I was there during a VERY busy time, the Waiters were amazing, and you should witness first hand these guys debone your fish right at the table! I've had most of their cuts, the Lamb chops, even the fish, and all I can say is that it's great! Also I personally dig the dark French Steak House look, very cool!

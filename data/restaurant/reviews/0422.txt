Unfortunately we were running too late to sample dessert, but will be back
Recently went before a show and it was the best meal i have had in a long time
Liked the scene and the sushi! It's a splurge but worth the money
I didn't believe it was possible to find good food near Times Square, but Blue Fin proved me wrong
The pan-seared cod with asparagus was incredible, as was the chardonnay suggested by the server, who was both friendly and helpful
Try to sit upstairs, as the downstairs room is quite loud and crowded
My boyfriend took me here for my B-Day on Dec 1st
I have always liked the W hotels and this one is also very nice
We made a reservation for 9:00 and were seated upstairs promptly
I was very impressed with the decor and meal
The Red Snapper was delicious and well as the Lobster Bisque soup
I would recommend sitting upstairs, you get a very nice view of the whole restaurant
The also have a sushi bar dowstairs
It can be a little bit of a tourist trap being in the middle of Times Square but if you are attending a play it is convenient
I will go back again just to try the sushi
Hearing great reviews, I was excited to try this new Blue Fin restaurant
Made a reservation, yet still waited 45 minutes to sit
Waiter was arrogant and aloof; did not smile once while we were there
The bread and butter was cold, and the fish was disappointingly overcooked
Do not recommend for dining
Try Trattoria Dopo Teatro on 46th b/w 6th and 7th for excellent fish and wine
Located in the middle of bustling Times Square, so it would seem like a convenient spot for pre-theater dinner
However, the food was so mediocre in preparation/flavor and quite undersized for the oversized price tags -- one of the worst dinner deals in the area
We had reservations and our party of 6 was seated immediately
Service was good considering it was pre-theater, and we got over to the Marquis in good time
The drinks were good, if on the pricey side, so I'd recommend this more as a place for drinks as opposed to eats
If you must eat, the sushi and rolls are not worth it (bland, not the freshest and expensive)
Food was great, bar was hopping, atmosphere hip (but not stuffy), out of towners need to try it! After reading about Blue Fin in Citysearch, my husband and I decided to try it during our annual Thanksgiving trip to New York
It was fabulous! Our waitress Lane, was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu
My husband had the filet and I had the tuna
Although my tuna was not cooked to my liking it was quickly fixed
Three different people came and apologized and were most couretous
The food was okay but unexceptional
The decor was very bland as was the service
They need to allow the servers to let a little of their personality show instead of acting like scared robots
Had one of their towers of seafood and the dips were totally inadequate for the type of food you were eating
The filet was good but you can't really mess up a prime piece of beef unless you really try
Won't be back and won't recommend to anyone
The Blue Fin isn't bad I've eaten there several times for business trips
They have a very good breakfast (because they are the W Hotel's restaurant)
The sushi is very good
Can be a bit loud
Flue Bin has the best sushi I have ever had anywhere
They will make any combination you request even if you don't see it on the menu
Try the tempure shrimo handrolls
They melt in your mouth
Prices are pretty outrageous, but its worth it
Its hard to find great sushi in Times Square and they serve until closing
We went for sushi and champagne after a broadway show and I thought I was going to have to be carried home
You walk in and its beautiful
We were taken upstairs and the hostess' stand was like an obnoxious club
We waited 1 hour, (we were 10 min
late for our res) The bar was overcrowded it took 15 min
to get a drink
After an hour our table was finally ready they walk us around and to our avial, no table ready
they apologize and give us a glass of champagne
15 minutes later
a table
The waitress was not friendly and messed up the entire order, apps
and entrees came together, the coffee was cold
The GM came over to ask if everything went well
I was not nasty and explained brieflly, the evening
She couldnt' understand why we just wanted to leave, so she apologized and we ordered dessert, she made is sound like it would be on the house, it wasn't
UGGGGGHHHHH we would never never go back
Really cool corner with a window to one of the best sites in the world
Time Square
then fabulous food to follow
it didn't hurt that I had great company
Blue Fin is definitely one of the fanciest restaurants in NY
Even though the food may not blow you away, it's still a wonderful place with great live jazz!!
Good neo-asian seafood served by atypically nice wait staff
Space unusually large - try to get seated upstairs
The bar is great
The second floor lounge is a great little hide away
Bartenders were very attentive and the three piece Jazz band was a nice addition to the ambience
Drinks are a bit pricey, but what the heck isn't in NYC
It's the raw menu that rocks
A friend of mine was staying at the W for a visit, so we hit Blue Fin a couple of times for dinner -- the quality of the sashimi is amazing
It melted in our mouths
Every single raw item we tried was perfect, and the dessert (some chocolate/caramel concoction) was delicious
I've read a lot of complaints about the rest of their menu, but I have to tell you, their sashimi is some of the best I've had in this city
Incorporate that with some of the excellent sake they offer, and you can't go wrong
Been here twice - first time was very disappointing
Had a cold seafood platter that looked very meager and did not taste much better, followed by the sea bass in a sauce that looked like baby food
However, the second time was a much better expericen
Lively sushi, excellent lobster/clam chowder, and delightful scallops
Am anxious to see how my next visit turns out
Despite all the negative commentary I heard about Blue Fin, my boyfriend made reservations for us so we could find out for ourselves
Surprise, surprise, we had an incredibly romantic evening and enjoyed some pricey but delicious food
My entire experience was very relaxing and enjoyable
If you're looking for a little privacy, ask to be seated in the little back room upstairs
Blue Fin is definitely a little on the expensive side, so don't go here if you're looking for a $50 dinner for two
including a bottle of wine
Beautiful ambiance, and kudos to Steve Hansen for putting some stake into Times Square
However, the food was seriously lacking
For the sushi, we tried the yellowtail jalepeno roll and lobster roll--I can't say it's very much better than East or any other run of the mill sushi joint
The entrees were decent but not amazing
Service was good
Overall, it's great to have a seafood place in such an accessible location--which is probably it's greatest asset
This place was amazing!!! I ate brunch there, everthing, especially the Belgian waffles!!!!!, was delicious!!!!! The Belgian waffles were the best I've ever had in my entire life!!! They had a great selection of smoothies and juices, I had rasberry-orange juice which was delicious! I definitely recommend it!

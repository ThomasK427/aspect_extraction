A great place for family gatherings and many good memories
I have been coming to this place for years
They have been serving great middle eastern food longer than anyone in the neighborhood
Friendly and family owned
You have to come here with a big group so you can get tons of appetizers
The hummus with lamb is incredible
The mixed grill as a main course is excellent also
It is not as cheap as some of the kebab places around, but for a nice restaurant, the prices are good
the service is cold ,brusque, unfriendly and too clicky
the burger was just average, the fries boring and warmed over ! the value dosen't measure up
maybe it was better in the 90's
NOT RECOMMENDED
where everybody knows your name
This is the Cheers of Bay Ridge, only better
Super friendly neighboorhood atmosphere where even a lady can go alone and have a drink and feel comfortable
Bartenders are great (especially John) and fast! Excellent bar food and the burgers are some of the best in all of NYC! Real reasonable prices, wait staff friendly and attentive
Wonderful, cozy decor with music just at the right volume
Great place to watch a game, hang out, eat, relax and meet other Bay Ridgers!
Food is great especially their hamburgers
Service can be slow even when not crowded
Great dacor
One of the best things that I like about Skinflints is the decor
Its has real cozy old world feel
There are many antiques, statues and great paintings
I particularly like the 4 monkey lamps on the bar
Skinflints is a great place for having a few drinks, eating at the bar, or sitting at a table
In the summer time they even have outdoor seating
I highly recommend however on the weekends be prepared to wait to be seated
Rumor has it that Jerry Garcia played at skinflints back inthe 1960's when it was a biker bar
The food is always great at Skinflints
Its a great place to eat and then move to the bar afterwards for some drinks
Was visiting my sister for the weekend and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Skinflints
The food was great, it was a great addition to our weekend
Friendly neighborhood atmosphere
Good bar food - nothing fancy
best burgers in New York
Nice old time bar feel
Long waits on the weekend - but worth it
A great bar with one of the best hamburgers in New York
It's not in Manhattan and it's not Donovan's so it's a secret
I get it with bacon and blue cheese
Fantastic!
took 10 people via limo to embers to satisfy a steak dinner bet among friends
ordered a couple of 64 oz
T bone steaks
lobster
great appetizers
our first time there and lou and theresa the owners treated our group from south philly like we knew them for many years
we are definitely going back
embers is a neighborhood restaurant and was recommended to us by a local who goes to all the new york steak houses and considers embers the best
if you go tell lou the gang from south philly sent you and we will be back with home made wine and soppressta
I went with 14 people to Embers mid afternoon on a Sunday
the place was empty and the waiters just hung out at the bar
ordering and waiting for the food took for ever the food was good  I wonder why the service improved only when this place filled up If I worked there I would be catering to a large group
The steak was awesome
The review that complained about the Brooklyn week menu, you got that a small steak b/c you ordered the $19 special at a steakhouse that usually costs $40-50 a person
The filet mignon for two and the steak for two are both great
(Though the filet won't be enough if both have hearty apitites
) Small but good wine list
We had reservations, and although it was packed we got seated in 5 min
I went to Embers with two of my girlfriends for Brooklyn's Restaurant Week
The menu was disappointing
Pasta or salad to start with
the salad was good but my friends hardly ate their pasta
Fish or filet mignon for the main course looked more promising
I have to admit that I loved the filet but we got a tiny portion (smaller than usual for filet mignon) and it was smothered in a roasted mushroom gravy type sauce
The sides were one piece of broccolli (that looked as if it had been heated in the microwave) and a baked potato
My friends hated the sauce
I liked it
Finally dessert was a cup of vanilla or chocolate ice cream (and no toppings offered), and we had to ask for some whip cream
This place is probably a decent steakhouse if you order from the regular menu but I was sadly disappointed
I'm sorry to say this, but I can't really rate the food because after an hour wait my husband and I never got seated
We finally left only to have trouble getting our car from the valet
After we handed the ticket to the valet he told us we had to wait because he needed the spot
Our car was right across the street and we wanted our keys and he wouldn't give them to us
He said he didn't care that we never got seated and wanted to leave and that he needed the spot and we would have to wait
With that my husband just grabbed the keys out of his hand and told him we didn't care about his job we wanted our car
Needless to say he didn't get a tip
EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT FOOD!!! We went on father's day b/c Lugar was booked, but this place is the equivalent! Make sure you get the HOUSE SAUCE!! VERRRRy tasty!
My boyfriend and I decided to try Ember on a friend's recomendation
Though it was crowded we only waited about 5 minutes for a table
We ordered the t-bone for 2- it was so good that even when we were full, we kept eating
The service was excellent as well, which was suprising because it was so busy
I will definately go there again, but I will make sure not to eat the day before!
But its great value
T-bone for 1 is massive good it may not be Prime but you are paying select prices
Lento's serves the best pizza in the world
This giant thin crust pizza is what I think of a great pizza
I've been going their since I was a kid, and haven't found anyplace that could match the taste, quality of service, and the way it is made
I highly reccoment this little resteraunt in brooklyn
Hey, but you be the judge
I'm a regular at Lento's and will always be a loyal customer
The pizza is some of the best in Brooklyn and at a great price
Both the white and the red are worth ordering
my personal favorite is the meat pie (which uses meat sauce instead of regular marinara sauce)
The mussels and clams are so yummy that you MUST get them as an appetizer
And
they have a great happy hour every weekday that should definitely be taken advantage of
Mmm
mmm

The bread was good
However, the quality of the steak is sub-par at best
We had two skirt steaks which were completely different cuts, and were overcooked, unseasoned, grey, and bland
To top it off, the drinks were weak which is unusual for an east village restaurant
Would not go back
Went with a couple of friends, and we were really happy with our experience! Great food (I had the tasty duck, and the tuna ceviche) and delicious drinks
It was busy (Fri night) but the staff was really friendly and fast, so we loved it
Highly recommended!
Don't order anything but the steak, the chops are rough, the chicken and duck dry as the desert
I was very disappointed with the meal althought the drinks were fantastic
i decided to post my review after scrolling down the list
i found that many of us are not patient at all
no offense! i personally went to Esperanto on a friday night
Yes the place was crowded and i had to wait, about twenty minutes for myself and three friends
During my wait i had a great tasting mojito and caprihina, and i got to know the staff
they where very pleasent with me and my friends
when i finally sat to have my dinner, my waiter immediately came over to our table to notify us about the foods that are 86
i told myself damm! i wanted the special
i ended up having the grilled tuna and my friends had the steak, crispy fish and the Moqueca
it was amazing
overall i had a great expierince and the service was good for a busy place

remember
be patient
relax
enjoy
Went last Friday to Esperanto
Immediately ordered drinks and the tapas platter
Waitress brought drinks and took entree orders
Time passed
More time passed
30 minutes or more later, no appetizers have come
Waitress comes up and tells us I forgot to order your food--what do you want me to do? I ask about the appetizers--surely she put those in
Nope
So we got a round of free drinks, cancelled the apps and got our entrees about 10-15 minutes later
The food is really good, and a great value
Drinks are fantastic--you must have a mojito or passion fruit caihpirina
Its too bad that the service almost ruined the experience
Expecting goodness, that's exactly what I got
Nothing mind-blowing, but everything was good or good enough
The night was Halloween, so the place was booked with masked men and women
Can't complain about the environment -- friendly staff, great music, plenty of space
We ordered calamari and crabcakes as apps, and both were delicious and fairly substantial (especially for two)
I then ordered the Pollo de la Casa, which was, at the risk of sounding redundant, good
Size was fine, taste was decent, good sides alongside
To wash it down, I opted for a Bavaria (an above-average light beer) and then an average mojito, an voguish cocktail I'm not crazy about to begin with
Around the table, no deep-rooted complaints to be found
Although the service was a touch tardy, everyone left satisfied after a good night out
Laid back chilled environment that always has a great vibe, be it coming from a charming manager or the warm and friendly waitstaff I always enjoy going there
the food is very tasty and inexpensive at the same time, I recommend the goat cheese salad or the coconut shrimp they're both great
they have good mojitos, but the really special drink that I really enjoyed is the passion fruit caipirinhia
overall great place where you can have great time with your friends
This is one of my favorite restaurants, but they need to do something about the service
we waited for so long the other night and there were only three of us
the Manager was somewhat rude and the bartenders completely incompetent
If I didn't really enjoy the food, I definitely would have taken my business elsewhere
The specials are always great, and I usually order the coconut shrimp
it's amazing
Still, the bad service and having to wait so long really kills the mood
Great drinks and corner terrace location that's really hard to beat are what make this place worth the schlep to Ave C
Go for a late brunch or dinner Mon - Wed and catch the live Cuban/Latin Bands
Hoever the food is hit and miss
The meat dishes are the strong point
Great Chorizo and Spanish totillas
The crab in banana leaf seamed out of a can, and ceviche had microscopic pieces of fish in it
The service was pleasant, but rather pushy when it came to ordering drinks and lingering at the end of the meal, despite the fact that they had a tendency to forget about the basics like water and bread
Excellent food but the service almost nullifies the good fare
Very festive but smokyAlso, what is this having to order your entire meal all at once? Appetizers, main course, desertnot cool
They should change that ASAP
I would recommend this restaurant for a good night of Latin American food but be prepared for spotty service
I've gone to Esperanto twice, and although it's not as cheap as the alphabet city location might suggest, it's quite good
The first time my friend and I were there early, and I took advantage of the early price fixe special
It was okay, and definitely a good value (appetizer/entree/glass of wine for like 20 bucks)
I got the chicken, but had to overlook more tempting selections that weren't part of the deal
The next time I ordered a la carte -- the shrimp in coconut milk is amazing, as are their mojitos
Yum
Went Wednesday night with two friends--loved the atmosphere and the food! Great mojitos, as reported, food really good--but not great, although great value
The winner on the menu was the crab in banana leaf appetizer--mmmm
planning to go back
The drinks aren't big but they're fresh and combined with the atmosphere, it's all a nice change from the usual happy hour
The walls are open and a corner breeze sweeps in and removes the cigarette smoke
If you don't smoke, this is a good place to bring your smoker friends without smelling them
If you don't want a loud crowd, if you want a spot at the bar, as small as the bar may be, this is a good place to check out
And best of all, when it DOES get too crowded, go to the bargila bar next door or wander up to ave B and take your pick of next places to hit
Can't go wrong in this neighborhood
I stopped in here with a friend to catch up over a few drinks and some dinner,the place was a bit trendy but friendly at the same time,there was no wait and the staff was all very friendly-our waiter didnt really speak much english but he was very attentive and accessible-all of the food was good- even the presentation was nice and we were in no way rushed out -we spent a solid two hours there with no signs that they wanted our table
This place is notorious for its bad service, granted
So when we went, our expectations weren't high
But as soon as we walked in, the manager started being extremely rude to us, telling us that we couldn't fit 5 people into one table and refusng to seat us separately, even though there were plenty of tables
Then we had a few entrees including the chicken, which was very dry and tasteless
The prices are too high, the service stinks, and the food is mediocre
All in all, a waste of our time
The atmosphere and vibe at Esperanto are fantastiic -- a bustling yet laid back environment that makes you want to linger while sipping one of their excellent mojitos
The food was abive average, though not outstanding
The staff was great! Friendly, fun and helpful
Quick service
friendly
informative about the menu
The food was wonderful

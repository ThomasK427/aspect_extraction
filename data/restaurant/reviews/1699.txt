The only good thing about the place was the host and the coat check
I waited an hour after I ordered for my food which wasn't very good, then the bus boy went to take my plate away before i was finished with it
Not recommended
I can't imagine how anyone could write a bad review
Can't wait to try out their new location in Vegas
Everyone in my party and around us was in hysterics, not a dry eye anywhere
We didn't order the erotic cake, but the one I saw served looked SUBSTANTIAL
Good food, great drinks, fabulous waitress - Gretchen, I believe, was the BEST!!!! The show was great - we got our bachlorette up on stage, although she didn't win, it completely made our evening
We went here for a bachelorette party and it was a disaster from start to finish
The food was about as good as you can make at home, if you're a terrible cook
Takeout is better
There's supposed to be a great show, but it lasted about 10 minutes - one set - and then nothing for the next 2 hours
Unless a waitress in a costume is a show
The drinks are beyond disgusting, weak, and $10 a glass
We ordered a cake for the party - it tasted good, but was tiny for the $75 it cost
The big surprise was when they tacked on a $15 service fee *to the cake*
And it was just plopped on the table, not cut or served
I could go on, but you get the idea
A huge waste of money and a huge disappointment for a special occasion
Then come to this place
Dont go for the food because the food is mediocore
The ladies are fun and funny and amusing and they hold back nothing
The place is incredibly crowded so if you expect to move even an inch lol dont go
Its fun to watch the entertainment and what not
Its a good time lol just dont expect too much
The food was good but it will not make up for the negligent, rude, condescending and hostile service with the full support of their management we received
Our waitress ignored our table for most of the night
The issue came to a head over getting change
We were paying cash, which I guess is unheard of in this establishment
She disappeared then we were told the entire restaurant did not have change for us because most of the customers were paying with credit cards
At our incredulous exclamations she threw our money at us and screamed that she did not want out tip though she tried to keep it
We complained the manager but our complaints fell on deaf ears
They are apparently making way too much money to care about a few disgruntled customer treated in a horrible manner
I asked for chopsticks to eat with my Pad Thai
Oh, we don't have chopsticks
We're 'Pan-Asian'
????? That was the first no no
Then the food itself was bland, overly greasy, and just plain bad
For the $14 I paid for that crap I was expecting something a lot better
But of course, the main thing here is the show, right? The 'Hostess/ MC' that night was just a bad comedian
He
she had tired old sexual innuendo's and jokes
They didn't work
She could've been much more witty and smart than she was
I will not come back to this shabby place
Came here again for a friend's bachelorette party this past weekend
The new menu is more Chino-Latino inspired than Pan Asian with salsas and sofritos as accompaniments
The cold Tomato-Mango soup is very much like gazpacho
The Mako shark is nice but still skip the desserts
The cakes are still dry,tasteless and unattractive
The Banana Split is a joke
Better off going to nearby Veniero's after dinner
This place is a blast! I've been here before and love it! Noticed that the menu is totally new and twice the size of the old one
With the large crowds here and the larger menu, be prepared to wait for your dinner to arrive at your table
The lines to the bathroom are pretty long too so I suggest going easy on the water! LOL! Seeing familiar faces here working makes me feel like I've come back to old friends and I know I'm going to have a good time in spite of the wait
Dont forget to bring a $1 for the bathroom attendant! She can be a bit crotchety! Check out karaoke but no Madonna songs (the host gets bitchy)
I loved this place
There were 12 of us at the table, and everyone had a blast
We got two of our friends Lapdance's, and neither of them had any idea about it
The whole restaurant was in hysterics, and the feeling was warm and inviting
I had the Sirloin and it was perfect, i enjoyed Every aspect of my time at Lucky Cheng's
I was brought up on stage, given 3 lapdances by customers, then pretty much undressed, haha
Take notice of the hostess
very very hot!!!
On a recent return visit I was pleasantly surprised to see a revamped menu! With a 10th anniversary next week I'm sure that this was all planned
The Thai chicken soup was divine (full of flavor with a kick!), the BBQ salmon was good if not a bit too salty from the heavy miso
My friend had the Dancing Shrimp (delicious!) which was curiously shaped like 2 shrimp entwined in a Tango
The Ahi tuna special was perfectly done rare with a nice tangy citrus sauce
All the dishes beautifully presented as are the waitresses
Definitely a delight to come back to an old friendly place
We went there with a small party (only 3 people) resently and had a great time
Our server Mayuko was a Queen in all senses of the word
I had the asian pear chicken, which was divine, and a lap dance for our birthday girl, which was hilarious
We all had a great time
Prize tip which we overheard from a manager(??): MAKE RESERVATIONS WELL IN ADVANCE
Walk-Ins, especially on fridays and saturdays, will be seated on a smaller are away from the main dining room (and the stage!!) if it's full
Then again, that area looked pretty quet and might be ideal if you don't want to be in the middle of all the excitement
This place attracts a lot of loud drunken bachelorette parties so it's not for families with young children
Cross your fingers that you are not sat next to a large party of them since they forget that they are out in public
My young daughter was scared of the place so we left without seeing the show
I'll come back another time with my adult friends
The food and drinks were good though
Karaoke hostess kicked our Bachelorette out of the bar after we had already paid for ridiculously expensive watered down drinks because the bachelorette wanted to sing a song that the hostess did not like
Hostess followed us out the door and called a member of our party a horribly derogatory expletive
Waited 30 minutes to speak to a manager who told us that this was all perfectly acceptable and that we were in the wrong for suggesting the song---the one that was in the book they gave us to pick from
NEVER AGAIN!
The food here is just awful but then I guess no one really go to this place for great food
The atmosphere is interesting but if you have been there once, it's enough
Went for a bachelorette party and the girls put us to shame!! Loved the food and our special cake
The honoree had a pretty racy lap dance
The best part about our night was the show
Sang karaoke until very late
Get a lot of sleep before you go
Visited this past weekend after reading the reviews on this site but the food here SUCKS! We waited FOREVER for a table and when the appetizers arrived they were cold or frozen in the middle! The chicken was raw on the inside and the pupu platter was cold
What gives????
What a riot! Bring your sense of humor when you go
The cocktail list gives you a hint of what's to come
Hillarious names for the tasty drinks! The food was very good (i
e
the chicken was not even dry) but the show and the staff are why you should go there

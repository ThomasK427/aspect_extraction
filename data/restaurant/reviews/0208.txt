had the portobellos, don't know why the other raters on citysearch raved about them so much
overall everything was around a 7 but I would only go back if I had another coupon
Went here with the Dine Out NY certificate which took off $50
Well worth it
Steak was good, not the best I've had
The mashed potatoes with bacon were delish! Also had sweet potato fries, asparagus and portobello mushrooms
all very tasty
The service is good
Nice atmosphere, nothing to fancy
Overall, a good steak experience
Left very satisifed and full
Went with a few friends with gift certificates
The steak was great
not the best in the city, but certainly well worth it
The sides are what blew us away though
The portobello dish was to die for! You must order it as a side
Nice wine selection as well
Everyone was pleased
Went with a gift certificate, which knocked $100 off the bill- definitely made it worth it
Steaks were good; nothing great
Unfortunately this was a last minute decision as we had tickets for a concert at MSG
Unfortunately this restaurant did not meet our expections with respect to the food
My companions meal was dry and my meal was a little bland
The only thing I truly enjoyed was my glazed carrots
Also, a little over priced
Went to Nick Stef's since I heard that it was led by a famed Los Angeles chef named Joachim Splichtal
Heck, this fellow knows hardly anything about steaks! His original restaurant in L
A
was great, but the food here was disappointing, atmosphere was even worse - a depressing experience, sorry!
The Scene The background music starts the journey, a modal Arabic mix of sitar and tabla
Patrons are guided to tables named "Damascus," "Beirut" and "Jerusalem" by a motherly hostess who addresses them as "baby" or "darling
" By the end of the meal--especially after taking pulls from the strawberry tobacco-filled hookahs--you'll be convinced you're in a Paul Bowles novel, ready to wander out into the moonlit desert night
The Food Middle Eastern fare that runs the gamut from the familiar to the outre, scoring big in each category
Six courses are served; their composition is left up to the kitchen
Highlights include zatter, a flat, round bread topped in a dark, dried smear of sesame seeds, olive oil and thyme; a brilliant, virtually narcotic vegetarian mousaka; and mjadarra, a strange and wonderful sweet-spice-flecked lentil puree usually served with tender grilled chicken kabobs
We came on a Saturday evening, the seats are very uncomfortable, we sat far from each other, the music very loud and it was difficult to talk
We had a predeterminented menu (whats usual on Saturdays) and the food was pretty good
The belly-dancer was average
The prices more than good, very expensive!! We payd $ 80 each
Dont't go on Saturday evening and ask for the prices!!
Mamlouk is as good as it gets
Arrive hungry (actually starved) because the amount of delicious food they bring is almost overwhelming
You will surely leave full and satisfied
It's got a very sexy atmosphere - ideal for a second or third date
The wine list could use some expansion
Be sure to let them know ahead of time if you have any vegetarians in your party
It's also perfect for groups
If you're into Middle Eastern food, this is the creme de la creme
We had a wonderful time at Mamlouk
We were there for the second seating (at 9:00) and the belly dancer was great
The food was amazing, and it just kept coming
one delicious dish after another
The wait staff were friendly, quick, and efficient
we got our drinks within minutes of ordering them
The best part may have been the apple tabacco and hookah pipe at the end
so fun
Definitly worth the $20
We had a bunch of drinks, coffee, tea, and the hookah pipe, and each couple ended up paying about $150
not bad for such a big dinner and such a great experience
We did the 9pm seating (they only have a 7pm and 9pm seating) and while we sat down right away, ti was 10pm before we had any food
The service was abominable; our waiter barely paid any attention to us, never filled our water, and overall couldnt have been more rude
He basically threw our food on the table and almmed our bottle of wine down without even asking us if we wanted to try it
We were also a party of 7, so they automatically added the tip in, making the meal evn worse of an experience
The food was tasty, but was completely overshadowed by a truly bad dining experience
the food was plentiful and good, the service waned towards the end, beware of the mint tea, while good
they are a bit sneaky since they don't tell you its not included in the price fix, so we got charged an extra $12
You'd think price fix menu means everything is included! Cheapest bottle of wine is $22 (merlot)
Overall recommended
I read the reviews on citysearch before dining here
The food is not large and I could have had a few slices of pizza after I left
If you are with someone you are both served little dishes at the same time which you share, not your own dishes
Might not work out well with vegetarians, though informed in advance, that does not seem to matter
There were only two groups in the restaurant at the time
I watched the other group receive special treatment and much more food since they seemed to speak their own language
The bathroom is pretty nice considering the location
The ambience was too dark too feel comfortable
The music was middle eastern and more authentic
I have never even LIKED sea bass before this dinner, and it was absolutely my favorite thing in the meal
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava
soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious
Slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?
I'm ambivalent about this place
First, the food was amazing
Go there not having eaten for hours, because your stomach will be sore by the end of the adventure/ordeal
Have a couple hours to spare with some friends
Now to the bad parts: for us, it was more like an ordeal
The music was too loud to sustain conversation and our waiter was not polite and SLOW
The belly-dancer that came out on that Saturday night was a pleasant surprise, but the bill came to over $50 a head (from each of 6 of us), albeit with red wine and hookah
But the hookah took forever to arrive and I wanted to start serving myself while staring at dessert waiting on a nearby tray for 20mins
I think the idea was to give us time since we were so full, but over 2 hours in one place is excessive
Went to Mamlouk for the first time last nite at the recommendation of my boyfriend who had been there before
In a city full of plentiful restaurant offerings, Mamlouk is one of the great finds
We took out of town friends there for dinner who like us, are serious foodies, and everyone was so impressed
The prix fixe menu of $35 is such an amazing value for the amount (go hungry! we rolled outta there) and the quality of the food you get
If you're a foodie and you are looking for a unique dining experience, head to Mamlouk
Just make sure to go hungry! You'll come out stuffed but happily so
I just had a birthday dinner here and we all had a wonderful time--the ambiance was sexy and cozy and the food was delicious! We enjoyed the wines we chose (just don't expect a lot of choices) and did I mention the food? Just don't fill up on the first few courses
the best is yet to come
The cheese puffs, falafel, and various dip-type items (hummus, etc) were tasty, but wait for the sea bass and lamb before you truly pig out
They have 2 seatings (7 and 9 PM--I'd recommend the later seating) and an upstairs and downstairs (which is better and more private)

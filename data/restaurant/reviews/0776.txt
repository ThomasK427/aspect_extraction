We had great service every step of the way
Sleek drinks and Great food
We ate and hung out untill the resturant evolved and took shape around the beautiful people in side
This had to be one of the best experiences I have ever had
Just wanted to say thanks for such a great night :)
Oh please! Do not listen to this person
The only thing that I will agree on is the place looks great
I went there for dinner and then late night and I had the best time
B+T? What place is not anymore on the weekend
I don't think this person should be writing a review
doesn't sound like they have gone out in over 6 yrs
As far as the music, i was there on a sat nite and the music was better then most places
The DJ was very good
Yes he played everything from hip hop to 80's, but if I recall every hot spot does now
If you want something different go to crobar for House Music! Oh and 2 last things, the food and speacialty cocktails were incredible, and the bartenders and waiters were very helpfull with any questions I had
TRUST ME
GO
We've been going to Taj for over one year now for its exceptional environment (it's a lush, warmly lit, gorgeous space) and fantastic, friendly staff
Located amidst 21st Street's many clubs, Taj does a great job of balancing class with what the crowd wants
The bartenders are fast, serving up good drinks
The DJs are always great
The place itself is nice looking and in a good area for club hopping
But the positives end there
Dodgy cheeseball crowd
Hate to be cliche but it was BT to the fullest
If you are into that type of thing great, but if you're not into greasy college kids from Jers grinding up on you avoid this place! DJ was eh
Hip hop from the 90s mixed with the typical Come on Ilene trax
Drinks were poorly made
Coat check was mandatory
It took 20 minutes to check my coat and about a 40 minute line to get it
Bouncer guy was smoking inside
are you kidding??? This place is pretty low class all around
Can't wait for it to close so another better lounge/club will go in since the only thing I like about it was location and the room itself
The decor is incredible, but they could definetely work on the service
The coat check person greeted us with absolute misery, the hostess basically ignored us (a party of 7 with interest for bottle service), and the waitress was MIA for the longest time!
What a great place!!! My birthday party at Taj last Friday was AWSOME!!! From the moment we got there the doorman was really friendly and made us feel totally welcome
We got inside and the party was picking up really busy
The drinks were great the service unbelievable and we never stopped dancing
Everyone had a great time which made my birthday the best ever
I definitely will be back
Had an amazing time with my friends
It was my first time there an I wasn't perpared to stay out all night but we had so much fun I couldn't leave
I had my 29th b-day party here on Saturday
A mgr promised me no cover midngt / $10 after, a 'VIP guest list' so we could skip the line
Instead, the rude completely unreasonable bouncer didn't even have my list, told me that the deal was *before 11pm*, we now pay *$20ppsn*
He scathed me (ON MY B-DAY!) for not getting there by 11pm, even though this wasnt what we discussed, that now we had to buy a table to get in
I was literally in tears w/the slew of frustrated messages from friends colleagues (visiting from out of town) who got turned away or told to wait most left
Moreover, the music was terrible; it totally didn't make up for things
In short, TAJ COMPLETELY RUINED MY B-DAY
Heard some great things about the ambiance and the drinks so with a group of friends, I decided to check it out
Not only was the decor very appealing but the drinks, appetizers and service were also top notch
I'd highly recommend Taj for groups or a private event
The ambience of Taj is magnificent and truly lives up to its name
HOWEVER A WORD TO THE WISE: the service is truly not up to par and brings the level of this place way down
I threw a private party there and was told I would be getting the VIP section
Not only was I not given the section when I showed up but the place actually kicked my party out after two hours- they had neglected to mention they were holding another private party that night
If you want to be in a beautiful setting and be treated in kind then by all means go there
If not, I would hightail it to another of NYC's fine establishments
The ambience is what makes this restaurant
Read some reviews re: small portions
Hate to say this but I have to believe these are early 20 year olds who are writing this
The portions are fine
They are well sized
But the food, overall is just average
The drinks are well done - and the ambience is great
You can't get that ambience easily
So it's worth it for a date - for mood - but if you want really great food - there are far better places
I've been coming here since they opened a couple years ago
The ambience is perfect - beautiful, harem-like drapes and pillows - and the Indian fusion menu is just wonderful
The portions are small, which means you'll still have room for their delectable desserts
The drinks are expensive, well worth it
I'd definitely recommend paying Taj a visit
I took my boyfriend to Taj for his birthday on Saturday
I was impressed by the reviews on citysearch and thought it would a good place to dine
I had reservation for 8pm
I figured from the review I should reserve a place early
We get there and decided we did not like the seating the host chose for us
She said everything else was reserved
Even though it was only 3 other tables dining
Anyway, our waiter Jesse moved us over to one of the separate seatings
I was very suprised how empty this place was on a Saturday night and we were there till 11:30 pm
I had the Red Snapper, which was very tasty
Say no to the mango chutney and raita
Beef is good
Servings are quite small
It looked more lounge than restaurant
Ambience is good, but I would definitely recommend going for drinks not dinner
We had an early dinner here and can't wait to go back to try all the other creative menu items we didn't have
We especially loved the delicious mushroom tart: just sublime! The drinks and wine selections perfectly compliment the food and the atmosphere is sumptuous and inviting
The service is attentive, genteel and entirely conducive to a leisurely meal
the service was verry bad i has a horrible time
I've had the pleasure of hanging out at TAJ on a couple of occassions
First impressions leave a lasting impression and the ambiance in TAJ is beautiful
They've taken great measures to make sure the food is just as amazing
You get the best of both worlds here
If you come in for a late dinner and stay a little longer, you can enjoy the latest hits as you dance your meal off until the early morning
Mixed crowd of ages and people, it's appealing to all
The service is excellent and people watching takes on a whole new meaning from the balcony level!!! Great place!
Reserved a table on the mezzanine for a party
We had to wait to get up there, but once we did, it was a generally good experience

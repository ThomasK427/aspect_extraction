Ignore the negative reviews - their expecations are skewed
No - it's *no* Turkish Kitchen (God Bless That Place!) but this is a great place for what it is - kick back for a bit and have some authentic meze
I'm from this part of the world, and must say the eats were pretty good
NOT a date spot, or grab the posse for a Dinner Night out
Point is: MUCH better choice than the local diner for some pre-drinking/partying yums
The most delicious food on the UES
I went last night with a friend -- we got a table right away and the service was friendly and helpful
But the food! The hummus and philo/feta mezes are outstanding
Delicious
We kept re-ordering everything
The prices are very reasonable as well
It's a must go!
The food is good if you like appetizers and desserts, but the waiter's attitude is terrible
The whole service was incredibly bad
Since we hated the service we tipped him 5%
The pig immediately came back and told us that we had to tip more
What a beggar
I have never been or seen a situtation like this before
Luckily, the manager was kind enough to apologize on waiter's behalf
If you don't want to be rushed when you are eating and be shown more respect to yourself rather than your wallet, don't go to this restaurant
This place has the look of someone's second floor apartment with a few tables thrown in and some waiters running around
The food was tasty and cheap but nothing great
It took 25 minutes for them to seat our table of four even while seating two other groups of four, and then stuck us next to the coat rack, which is just thrown in the corner of the place
We ordered wine and it took another 20 minutes to get that
Also, with our appetizers we got four slices of bread for four people, so the bread bowl was empty the whole time
There are about four main dishes, hardly a selection
Basically, the place just makes you want to throw some cash on the table and get out of there
Having lived in Istanbul, I can certify that Beyoglu serves very authentic and delicious Turkish cuisine
If you are unfamiliar with that country's foods, start with the yogurt soup (hot, creamy, and savory), a Coban Salata (with just the right amount of mint), the ezme (perfectly spiced chopped meat meze), and the Iskender Kabob
Add an order of hummus if you have room as a perfect complement to their wonderful, fresh bread
If you're not in the mood for wine, try the Efes Bira: a perfect complement to the above suggested menu
Don't feel that the serving staff is hovering; it's the Turkish tradition to have several dedicated waiters standing within arm's reach to ensure promptness of service
Raki is not for the faint of heart, but the perfect ending for such a meal
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT IS ALL HYPE
ARE THEY PAYING SOMEONE TO WRITE THEM UP EVERYWHERE????ALMOST ALL OF THE MEZZE'S ARE COLD
THEY BRING OUT LITTLE TINY PLATES OF COLD SALAD TYPES OF FOOD
(LIKE COLD SPINACH WITH YOGURT) IT'S NOT BAD BUT NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
FOR GREAT TURKISH FOOD GO TO TURKISH KITCHEN
THE FOOD THERE IS AMAZING AND JUST AS CHEAP
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BUZZ IS ABOUT FOR BEYOGLU
IT'S DECENT BUT HARDLY MEMORABLE
At first I thought that the problems had to do with the fact that they were a new restaurant
However, they continue to be plagued with inefficient, terrible management
My friends and I LOVE middle eastern food (espeically Turkish)
so I must say, we were quiet disappointed with the food after reading all the reviews
For a house that raves about parsley being the main ingredient, there were hardly any in the tabouleh
we are sure one yogurt appetizer was made from sour cream and not yogurt(ugh)
and the sardines literally tasted like it came from a can
Otherwise, it's definitely lively and the ambience is good
The staff is very nice as well
However, it's pretty bad when amateurs like us can tell that it is NOT authentic AT all
If your in the neighborhood, this restaurant is a must try! It serves meze's (tapas) and only one main course which is the Doner - delish! The meze's are interesting and lots to choose from
The atmosphere is fun and the service is good
Great for a quick meal
As I am not a big fan of Turkish food, I was skeptical about going there
Once there, the lively atmosphere and the buzzing scene made me realized that at the minimum, I would have a fun night
The food did not disappoint either
The appetizers were average but the donner kebab was the best! Even better than the ones I've had in Istanbul! So remember to save your appetite for the kebab and
a Turkish coffee at the end of the meal!
My first Turkish food experience was not as I hoped
I got the Kebab Doner and barely finished a quarter of it when my date finally realized I wasn't enjoying it
It was too salty
The mashed eggplant was lost in the dish
She had the shrimp dish, which seemed be only shrimp simmering in a marinara sauce
She didn't like her meal either
I was also bothered by the waiter constantly hovering over my shoulder
I don't like being rushed to finish my meal
We were persistently asked if we were done or if we needed anything else
The only saving grace was that the atmosphere was intimate and I enjoyed being with my date
I went to Beyoglu last night with my boyfriend and really do not understand the positive reviews
Two positive things: nice decor and cheap
Now for the rest: the waitress was very strange: the whole meal, she marched up and down the aisle inches away from our table (to make us uncomfortable?)
At the end of the meal she seemed upset because I didn't want to take the leftovers with me
Of course, the reason I didn't want them is that the gyro platter consisted only of overly thick pieces of greasy meat
We were so uncomfortable, we left in under 30 min
Have never had such a quick dinner before!
Good food, nice decor but the owner has made sure my friends and I never visit again
It's a Turkish Tapas place with only 2 main courses and the waitress was angry at our group when we only ordered appetizers and drinks and no main courses
When we asked what the problem was, the owner made a rude comment about how we should have spent more money!
Even though I went there very late (around 11
30) they were still serving food
The food was adorable, it's an experience that u should definitely taste
Nice people, nice music, it was great!!!
We had to wait until 10 to get a reservation, but it was worth it
Great ambience, good music (although loud at times), and wonderful food
Most amazing grape leaves I have had, great hummus, kibbi and shepherds salad
Would be perfect for a large group of friends
I will definitely be back!
This was my first Turkish food experience so I was glad that it was a good one
A very good one
The restaurant is new so it is still working through some kinks (lots of greeters, helpers and servers milling about - but all eager to help)
The food was very fresh and served fast
Order a few appetizers and then go for the Kebab entree
So yummy
Good atmosphere, great prices
A perfect UES addition
I've been to Turkey 5 times and met my wife there on the first
The two of us went here a few weeks back and it was honestly nothing special
Its kind of over-hyped
There are plenty of much better options around the city for great Turkish food

Amazing Fondue for chocolate lovers
The food was very good
Our party had four people in it and we all tried eachother's meals - one was just as wonderful as the other! The service was okay - but when I made the reservation I told them that it was my Mother in Law's birthday - what was great was come desert they remembered
It is that kind of service that means a lot to me - more than if my water gets filled quickly
I took visiting family to BWG after a recommendation from a friend
However, the service was horrible
Even though we had a reservation we waited for a long period of time and the host was rude
It was a Sunday night and not overly crowded
Once we were finally seated, it was way in the back and under a staircase
On the positive side, the food is quite good, especially the olive crusted tuna
If you can deal with bad serice, the food is worth the trip

I have been here a number of times because I love the atmosphere so much that I continue to give it a chance to redeem itself in the food department
Unfortuanately, the food has been consistently disappointing - especially the fish, not fresh most of the time, flavorless, over-cooked and the tuna I had (rare) on one occasion seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and was extremely gristly - I've had grilled tuna across the park at L'Express that was superior compared to this
Unless someone else is paying, I won't go back here for dinner
My sister and I treated an aunt for brunch last Sunday
We chose Blue Water Grill on the recommendation of our friends and for its live music
Food was good
Ambience was good
Music was good
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR WAITRESS SUCKED BIG TIME!! She looked like she had a hangover that it took her 38 minutes before she got our orders
Two groups of diners behind us in line had been served already while we were just waiting patiently for someone to take our orders
Calling the attention of a service staff is comparable to catching a fly with chopsticks
Sad to say, she seems pretty clueless as to what service means
I may come back but only with the assurance that I do not come across her
I strongly recommend she goes back to training
This is not my favorite seafood restaurant in NYC (Shaffer City is better), I thought the food here was reasonably priced and tasty
When I went, the place wasn't that busy and the wait staff were rude
However, the food made up for what the service lacked
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS
DIVINELY DELICIOUS
THE SEAFOOD IS FRESH AND MARVELOUS WHEN GRILLED
EVEN THOUGH WE GOT THERE EARLY WE WERE SEATED RIGHT AWAY
EVERYTHING FROM START TO FINISH WAS GREAT AND I HAD A WONDERFUL ANNIVERSARY
DO TRY THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE AND THE VALROHNA CAKE (SINFULLY DELICIOUS)
Blue Water is great place to eat dinner
Nice atmo and good seafood
Around 120 for 2 people, app, entree, bottle including tip
I've taken a few of my clients there
Everytime I went I had a very pleasant experience
The food was very good
The Chilean Seabass does not disappoint
But you need to save room for desert because the Banana Caramel Tower was very good
I'm shameful to admit I ate every bite of it
I've eaten dinner here at least 10 times and never been disappointed
The service is always helpful and attentive
The oysters are great, although I would have liked a larger selection
The fish is fresh, nicely portioned and well cooked
I always finish with the Valrhona chocolate cake and a glass of Port
Always very solid and reasonably priced
Being from San Francisco I may be biased on this but I had a $9 glass of cab that was similar to the quality of a $3 bottle of wine
Other than that, the food was very good
I had a tuna sushi roll that was excellent
I liked the downstairs eating area best, where the jazz is performed
Everything we ordered was delicious (from fish to steak) plus we had a great table in the jazz room
The entire experience was perfect
The reservation system is a bit messy it took the host upstairs a while to find our reservation the host downstairs did not have our information at all but was able to squeeze us in
Service was friendly we don't feel stuffy like some other restaurants
Blue water lived somewhat up to its hype
It energized atmosphere was all there however the food was good and service could have been a little better for a so called great restaurant
Not to say it was bad, it just wasnt the best
Also be prepared to drop some dough
Excellent food service
You got a bang for your buck
Recommend it to everyone and will return ASAP!
I was disappointed with our dining experience
We had a group of nine
Seating was very cramped
The service was poor
The food was pretty good
But, I've had much better in NY
I will go elsewhere next time
I've had a great experience everytime I go to the Blue Water Grill
The jazz room is amazing and so are their oysters
If you plan on going, make a reservation at least one week in advance
they book up quickly!
Just had a great Brunch with a friend on Sunday
This old bank converted into a restaurant looks very cozy and chic
You can walk in without a reservation to nab a table but they request that you'd better be finished in an hour though
The fluffy seafood omelette and fresh squeezed orange juice is hard to beat
With the Jazz music filtering in and the cocktails come in after 12 PM, you are guaranteed to ease your way into a lazy Sunday
We're going to try the jazz room next time
My boyfriend and I got there early and ordered a martini from the Jazz Room bar
These martinis were huge, two for one basically, and absolutely delicious! Our waiter was incredibly friendly and was very knowledgeable of everything in the restaurant
We ordered the chopped salad and filet mignon maki roll (cooked) for appetizers
The roll was amazing
I had the blackened swordfish and he had the monkfish special
Everything was so savory! The more we ate, the more we loved our food! We had to try desert, even though we were stuffed to the gills
We shared the chocolate fondu and quickly forgot how full we were
The fruit that came with the fondu was perfectly ripe, no bruises at all
Everything about this place was perfect, even the price! What a wonderful treat! We can't wait to go back!
I've been here a million times and never been dissappointed
It is consistently good in all aspects
It is a huge space, there are three seating areas

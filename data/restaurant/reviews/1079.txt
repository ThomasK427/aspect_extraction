WE ordered house wine at $6 a glass, instead they gave $15 glasses of wine
WE complained they took the wine and charged us anyway
Then host insisted we drink a wine he likes, he brought out pepper wine
The spicey hangersteak was three tiny little morsals that would fit a thimble
Unhip additude , snearing grins and overpriced tiny portions says it all
NO NEED TO WASTE A WONDERFUL EVE AT THIS HORRIFIC RESTAURANT
Six of us for a 7:30 reservation and were seated once everyone arrived
The waiter was nice, knowledgable, and helpful
The food was mediocore (once it arrived)
Definitely plan on waiting
Expect the Lobster/pasta dish
We shared it as an appetizer, it was surprisingly flavourful
Interesting spicy cottage cheese served with the bread
The lamb is ok, all portions are freshingly small, although unexpect when living in the US
The only thing that came promptly was the bill, then we were asked to leave and have a drink at the bar if we wished
If they needed our table so badly the appetizer's and entrees should have come at appropriate times
Try it once, no need to return
PS: Bench seats need back cushions!
We went there for dinner on a weeknight at 09:00pm
The waiter advised us to order an appetizer since 'it will take 30mns for the entree to be ready'
It took 30 mns for the appetizer to arrive
Very good but not enough
Then we waited 40 more minutes for our entrees
The waiter was friendly and sorry for us
My boyfriend and I dropped in here without a reservation and were treated like royalty
The staff was wonderful
and the goat entree was to die for !!! The bar menu is fantastic
try the Pompadour !!! I'd definitley go back here
the food, service and atmosphere make for a wonderful experience
I did not get a chance to enjoy what was supposed to be great ambience for long
After a short 30 minutes of chatting and enjoying our drinks we were approached by the very pretentious Maitre D' who RUDELY demanded we order as our table was needed
At all times there was an empty table next to us so we didn't understand the necessity of US leaving
We were also never told upon arrival that our table would be needed by a specific time
For the fine dining establishment it is supposed to be, unless you're friends with someone be prepared to speed eat
It will however keep you for spending and outragious amount of money on the bite sized entrees
They seem to have missed the class on servicing the customer and making them happy so they'll spend more
even with a reservation, expect to wait at least 45min- 1 hour
Bad overpriced drinks at the bar
there are better choices in the area
5 ninth's menu is wonderful and unique
I will definately come back here
I brought a date with me and we loved everything from the bar, to the food, to the design, the wine list was very different and rare from most restautants I'd been to
Had a great time!
The food was great, as always and hanging out upstairs after dinner was so much fun! Many beautiful people everywhere
great people watching and the music was the best that I've ever heard there, that should definitley NOT change
I loved 5 ninth, food is exceptionally good and the design is really beautiful
It stands out from the rest
Our waitress was sweet and fun
They also have a lounge upstairs where you can have an after dinner drink!
Though the restaurant has a nice ambiance it wasn't worth going with all the other negative parts to our dining experience
The menu options were not appealing, we had to beg the waiter to ask the chef if we could have just a plain dinner salad to start as their salad choices were not appetizing
The waiter was rude and a low talker and when asked to speak up he rolled his eyes
The food was average and was abslolutely not worth the price
For two people to eat without any alcohol or dessert was $140 including tip
It wasn't worth it!!!
Meal or Saturday Night Live Skit? I am still not sure
The only thing I am sure about is the fact that i will not eat here again
Make sure you ask for all of the ingredients of EACH dish
They enjoy throwing in controversial items without a mention
I came to 5 ninth last week with a bunch of friends and had a wonderful time
The food is truly delicious and the wine list was very interesting
they had a bottle of Basque wine, whcih I have never found in any restaurant in NY
Later we went up to the lounge and had a bottle of Krug and some desserts
I would come back to this restaurant in a heart beat, but watch out it is expensive, but I guess that comes with the neighbourhood!
This is the worst restaurant I have even been in
The menu was small and horrible
They were out of 2 items
Loud,cramped, terrible service
Food was inedible
We all looked at each other and saidyou've got to be kidding AVOID
It doesn't matter how well the kitchen turns out food when you are ignored by the front of house staff
Typical of the new Meatpacking District vibe
the staff has the I can't be bothered with you vibe down pat
The meat packing finally got a place worth coming to for the food
Which was amazing
really interesting delicious food
The place is really warm and has a great design
I just moved to the west village and will make this place my spot
Hate coming to meat packing district nowadays, but this place was worth it
The space is gorgeous, the maitre 'd super charming, the food was sooo delicious
Had an overall lovely experience
I go out to eat alot in the city and rarely do I go to an expensive restaurant that makes it really worth every penny
The food is delicious
I came with three other friends and we were seated on the 2nd floor
After telling our waiter that we would be back for the lamb dish, he said that hopefully it will be on the menu next time
When we asked why, he said they change most dishes on their menu every week
I loved that! It reminded me of dining in rustic places in Europe
The food rocks at 5 ninth, the ambiance was sexy and energizing
service was somewhat slow but when the food arrives
its heavenly
I came with a bunch of friends and the host at the door was very friendly
I will definately come back with a date
My boyfriend and I arrived early for our reservations
We were asked to wait for a table, although we noticed that people who came in after us were seated immediately
When we were shown our table, it was in the middle of the walkway in the bar area, terrible seating! When we asked if we could wait for another table, the hostess told us nothing would be available for 30-45 minutes
When we said we'd wait, she told us it was the table in the middle of the walkway or nothing
When we looked as though we were going to leave, she showed us to a cornertable
Which she knew would be available, but just didn't want to tell us
The food was mediocre
One of the covers of the dishes was scalding, but the waiter didn't tell us and my boyfriend nearly burned his hand when he removed it

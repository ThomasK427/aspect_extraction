With Bocce (sp) Ball playing across the street and the amazing Lemon Ice King of Corona, Parkside is great
The dishes are reasonably priced and the restaurant is very nice instead
The Veal Sorrentino is great and so are the seafood dishes
Don't knock Queens
Parkside rules
I've been going to Rincon Criollo since I was born
My parents both love this restaurant and being born into a Cuban family, I enjoy coming here as often as I can
I feel like I'm in the old Rincon Criollo which originally began in Cuba and came to the United States later on
The food is fantastic, the staff is fantastic, and the atmosphere is fantastic
Some things are a little pricey but not all
Overall I give this restaurant a 10!
This is the best cuban food in NY
the atmosphere is outstanding
Come celebrate a birthday there and see the crowd go nuts with festivities!! The food is outstanding and the service is authentic
Take it form someone who has been there from the begining
There is no Match!@!
Great food! A bit greasy, but delicious
Good prices (average $9=entree) and great staff! You are seated and served promptly
Not chinese food, but rather some chinese and a lot of spanish styled dishes
I have had brazilian style before, once in NJ, very similar to here and once in brooklyn, HORRIBLE
This place is really good, a few meats werent to my liking but i promise u will find AT LEAST 1 thing that you can just eat, mine was the beef ribs, AMAZING, and i dont particularly like that usually
avoid dessert and drinks, long island iced tea 7
50
Not worth it
Just come in get a lot of meat and thats it
the all u can eat bar is good to, but ur here for the meat remember that
Bar has, french fries, bunch of different vegs and fruits, sushi, ribs (not great, wait for the waiters that come around with the meat)
When we arrived we were greeted by a very unfortunate-looking which symbolized the very unfortunate service and food
The meats were overseasoned and the rice was stale
We had to fill ourselves with salads and french fries to feel like we actually had a 'meal'
I hate this place and I would never come back here again
Take my advice and stay away!
The food is good along with friendly and accomendating waiters worth the price which isn't bad
But, don't be on a diet or have a colesteral problem
All I can say is we ate straight for 45 minutes straight, and that did not include the desert
This was the first time I had went to Grees Field and I was blown away with all the meat, however I will not be sidetracked by the salad and side buffet next time
At least 20 different kinds of meat being paraded by your table on a regular basis
They had a great wine selection to choose from, the single mixed drinks were a little pricey
You can totally get you moneys worth if you just skip lulnch and catch a late dinner
Oh, try for the reservation
With out one, a table for 2 took about 30 minutes
If you are on a low carb plan, and even if you arent
this is the place for you
Meats galore
bountiful salad bar with many low carb choices
hot foods (most are carb laden)
come hungry
very hungry
This place was terrific
I've been to Brasil more than once and it's the closest thing to it
Way better value, price and quality than other places in the city
Definitely make a trip here but don't eat for awhile before you go, you'll be stuffed!
Where should I begin? This restaurant is a favorite of mine
There's nothing like the combination of meats from Green Fields combined with their sangria
It's a great place to take a group of friends
It's not romantic, but I would recommend it for steady couples looking for great food
FYI
With Brazilian food, there's no menu
It's a all you can eat style service
But don't confuse it with bad buffets, the food here is top notch
The Green Field is a huge Brazilian (it's owned by Koreans) Churrascaria
The decor is certainly not top class here, but the meat selection is almost overwhelming
Pace yourself, perhaps starting with some greens available at the buffet table, and then enjoy! I highly recommend the chicken hearts, but remember: ask the waiters, since they're not usually available and will be cooked upon request (and will go fast)
$25 will give you as much meat as yoy can eat (and very good meat), but stay away from the overpriced drinks and desserts
If you're looking for the best Chinese food in town, you've gotta visit Double Happiness! The egg drop soup is delish, the sweet 'n sour chicken is tempting, and as mentioned
a big wow for those wonderful wan-tons! Just the name inspires me to dine at this lovely restaurant/spa 'two-in-one
'
Great place to go eat after church
Really enjoyed the food
Great if you have kinds and it's nice and spacious
Food is always fresh, top quality ingredients always used and most important, the place is always clean
The best pizza (try the eggplant and ricotta pie!) and the veal and chicken dishes are out of this world
Great homade slada dressing too! Also very friendly and They always get your order right when you call in
Original Rosa's Pizza hands down makes the best pizza in Queens
The staff is very friendly and the the owner makes you feel like you are family
They make you want to eat out every night!! You have to try the Chicken marsala and the home made salad dressing! My mouth is watering!
This place is a classic the best place for a burger
The beef that they use is definitely top quality
Believe it will the best experience you have in eating a burger
I FINALLY ATE AT JACKSON HOLE, AND I HAD THE BEST CHEESEBURGER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! THE GUACAMOLE IS GREAT TOO
GREAT APPETIZER BEFORE THE BURGER!
The burgers at Jackson Hole are to die for
You should come on an empty stomach becuase you will really fill up on one of these gigantic burgers
Gianni's has the best chicken francese
I have had in other places and just can't compare
They also make a mean garlic bread
My husband loves the Veal Marsala and Monk fish
A friend recommended this restaurant to me, and it was a solid choice
The food was fresh and flavorful (Chicken francese was divine, a great variety of desserts)
The prices were reasonable considering other places in Queens
A pleasant and clean atmosphere, with the owner, Ana, accommodating and warm
Good homestyle Italian cooking!
Breakfast served all day and pancakes served a variety of ways are the hallmarks of this diner-style restaurant
In Short The first International House of Pancakes opened in a suburb of Los Angeles in 1958 serving a menu of hearty breakfast favorites
Today the restaurant still serves its signature dishes like the original buttermilk pancakes and pigs in blankets: sausage links wrapped in hotcakes
Other breakfast items include waffles, omelets, French toast and crepes
Non-breakfast offerings include sandwiches, burgers, entree-sized salads, and dinners like T-bone steak, pot roast and herb-roasted chicken
I looove IHOP! You can't beat the Rooti Tooti Fresh N' Fruity
The griddle cakes are exceptionally fluffy and lite
This is about the only place I can go and eat everything on my plate

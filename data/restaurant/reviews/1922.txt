:(
Caffe Reggio is the quintesential cafe
My only complaint is that it has the world's most uncomfortable chairs, but I figure the reason for this is they don't want people too stay TOO long (it's easy to get lost in a book while sipping a fabulous latte and forget about anything else
including ordering a second cup!)
Also, service is unpredicatable - sometiems they're nice, sometimes they're just too busy or bored to be nice
But still, it's one of my favorite cafes in the city
While I was eating a tasty Rome at Night--which is a cocktail of fresh fruit in yoghurt with the fat back in where it belongs, my friend commented to me: This is the sort of place you expect people to write in
We looked around
She was right
Two people at different tables were scribbling away
Tourists on a break? Students from nearby NYU? Who knows? This little coffee shop, with its cramped tables, tiny wall-mounted busts of composers and huge old paintings, definitely has character
Supposedly, the building dates back to the 18th century; the cafe itself to the early 20th
Plus I was sitting in what appeared to be an old telephone nook at the back of the restaurant
(The door was gone; the phone remained
) With its old world charm and nicely bitter cups of coffee, this joint is a Village classic
It's really the best sandwich I've ever had
Seriously
Yum
I work around the corner from this small take-out place and all the gurls at work love it
The soup id great, the slice of break is about 1/2 inch think and huge
Everything is fresh and in the monrning when I go for breakfast (recommend the cinnamon roll-molasses!) I see the workers making the lunch specials
You can see inside the place and it's very clean
They are always nice to me, although they speak mostly spanish
The prices are a little high, more like a cafe price than a take-out place
The place has a kind of farmy look too
My co-workers like the cookies too
The specials are great too
Each day is different
It's a great little break from the shopping in SOHO and well worth the visit down Prince, while there visit the shops on the sidestreets and say HI
I had a soup a Olive's the other day, which was real good indeed
It comes with a meager slice of white bread, however, and when I asked for an extra slice they charged me fifty cents
Hard to believe, but yep! - that's how good the service is
The sandwiches are great
Ditto salads
The brownies are so good, they make me want to slap my mother
Yet, it's expensive
It certainly was not a good eating moment for me
The salad was heavy on the dressing, so sour my mouth pucked and the greens seemed a bit stale and dark
The pizza was my sad, sad lament
Two key things about me: I LOVE pizza and I HATE waste, which means I tend to finish what is on my plate
Maybe I did bad in ordering pizza by the slice -- I had two mushroom pizzas and found the slices heavy with oil, hard with congealed cheese (did they microwave my pizza?) and the mushrooms tasted and looked like they were canned
Ambience is fine and probably, if I had eaten better, I would have appreciated it more
I was too terrified after the food to try the coffee
(Revised) This used to be an excellent pizza joint
The pizza with prosciutto arugala wass to die for
Even if you to specify that you want the crust burnt, and you remind them of this, they will deliver doughy pizza crust
On the phone, the pizza cook is cantankerous and difficult (gender issue?)
lots of pizza joints in the Village and Tre has gotten my very last order after screwing up at least 5 times (every time I have called) in the last 3 months
I went to this place because a friend picked it - i had bad impression right from the start, because the restaurant was empty
The service was bad, nothing worse than the usual for that area
But the food was terrible, the cream sauce i had was greasy and heavy
My family is originally from Naples and I got there often to visit
I get shocked when people try to compare this food with real italian food
It's cheap, but it's not that far from cafeteria pasta
I've worked in this neighborhood 8 years, am no stranger to good food, especially Italian, and especially in the part of the village where tre-g resides
I LOVE this little place as do those in my office! For the prices you can get delicious pizza and very tasty trattoria fare
It's frequented by NYU folks and locals and does have the casual feel of say a busy, unpretentious wine bar in Rome
The service can be mixed overall -- it is very casual and can get crowded -- but it's never stopped me from going and enjoying it all these years
I've been all over the city to cheap little Italian places with the same prices, but there is definitely something about this place that gives great bang for your buck and delicious food
If you are in the area, it's silly not to go here, you won't be disappointed!
Ok first of all the lady who said a cat jumped on her is completely a moron
I suggest getting a little older and coming on this site
you know some people actually want GOOD reviews
anyways the food was great in this and the inside is magnificent
I loved the style of the restaurant as it reminded me of a restaurant in the lower regions of Italy
As for the service it was pretty good too(I have no clue what the cat lady is talking about) I reccomend this restaurant to everyone who wants great and inexpensive food :)
I went to Tre Giovani on a Sunday and had the worst service I ever: while we were eating a cat jumped on my friends lap! We asked the waitress and the guy at the counter to take it out of the room, but they simply ignored us
The food was not much better, I had a rigatoni with a very acid tomate sauce
hey - the food is tasty
I got the tri-colore pesto, friend got the pizza
Both were filling and yummy
good bread, but they only take cash, so be ware
The soup and salad look good too
The waiters, however, are typically unpleasant and non-existant when needed
But hey, that's new york!
This is another one of those places where good food comes cheap
The service is quick, and the guys behind the counter are polite and friendly
As for the pizza, it is quite good, and well worth the paltry $2
00 per slice that they charge
Sit down for a minute to enjoy your food, or grab a slice or a pizza to go
Either way, you can't go wrong, and it is definitely worth a try
Ben's pizza is amazing!!!!! It's the perfect late night pizza stop, my friends and I swear by it
If you're in the village, it's a must!!!
THis is the best pizza there is, forget Joe's on Bleecker this one is the one to go if you want really good pizza
Nice thick slices
Never fails after a night of bar hopping
whenever I'm in the Village I always stop by Ben's for a slice or 2
the guys behind the counter are always friendly and they always have fresh pizza ready
it's pretty cheap also
The Scene This small (predominately takeout and delivery) location of the Two Boots chain is almost always bustling with activity--you'll always find a crowd here late on the weekends coming for a slice on their way home
They even have some cute tables to sit at while you devour
The Food Two Boots proffers one of the more unusual culinary hybrids around, joining flavors of Italian and Louisianan descent (two boot-like landmasses--get it?)
You can order po' boys and other Cajun dishes, but as at all the Two Boots outposts, the delicious thin-crust pizza is the main attraction
Sample celeb-inspired pies like the Larry Tate (white pizza with spinach, garlic and tomatoes), the Mr
Pink (spicy chicken, tomatoes, fresh garlic) and the Earth Mother (a vegetable-only homage to Bette Midler)
You can't beat Two Boots for a quick snack or gret lunch
Ever since I lived down the street, Two Boots has become a NY favorite
I loooove the Larry Tate, and there is always something great to try!! Don't miss it next time you are in the City
we go to two boots every time we are in the city
everyone we bring there loves it too

but I actually like over-attentive waiters, so I didn't mind
If you're craving seafood
GO
you'll get your fill and walk out satisfied
Quaint setting too
Food was very good and the seafood was fresh, we went with a party of 8 and we all enjoyed it
They even gave us a free pitcher os sangria while we waited for the table
We will definetly return
After reading your ratings I was disappointed
The food was moderate, I had much better spanish food! It was so cold in the restaurant, we were all freezing during dinner
There are lots of better places in NYC!
Excellent food and service, very caring and attentive staff
Sure beats the places in NJ, well worth the trip
I have been to most Spanish places in NY, and the majority are not even owned by Spaniards, this one is, and you can tell
I was pleased with the service and Food
It appears small from the outside but dont let it fool you, the place is quite large, so large it extends to Sullivan street
I definitely recommend it
Twelve of us went for my girlfriend's birthday and we had a great time
We ordered a whole slew of tapas and lots of sangria and the bill was ridiciously cheap!! The service was wonderful, which is hard when there are 12 people, but we didn't have one complaint
I definitely recommend this place when searching for tapas and sangria!
Cafe Espanol is hands-down one of the best restaurants in the city
Not the fanciest, not the trendiest, but great food, huge portions, amazing sangria, and an incredibly attentive waitstaff that make it a dining experience perfect for any occasion
Go go go!
I took my girlfreind and her parents for there annivesary
We all loved the restaurant, its small, but not cramped and has a bit of intimacy to it
We loved the food and the service was excellent
If you are in the village and in the mood for seafood, visit this restaurant, by far one of the best restaurants
I will be returning in the immediate future
Se habla Espanol? Well, whether you speak Spanish or not, this place will have you speaking ABOUT (Cafe') Espanol for days
Every person I have ever brought to any of its three locations have deemed it 'fantastic' and have gone back for more
This Bleeker location is the one with atmosphere
Gardens, ambience, different rooms, etc
The broiled lobster and sangria are must-trys
If you love paella or lunch specials, you're in for a treat
The prices are quite reasonable
And the flavor? You'll be speaking Spanish in your sleep!
outstanding food and service, consistency being the main point
Beautiful outdoor garden
Probably the best place for a meal with prompt and quality service in the area
Sangria is smashing and should not be missed when ordering
After living in Spain for 6 months, I have been hard pressed to find any sangria in New York equal to the delicate balance of wine, and fruit that I found there
Good news! I have found it again in the sangria at Cafe Espanol
Great place to go for Paella, and the best sangria in NY! It can be a bit loud and crowded, especially on the weekend, when the wait can be insane for a table
But, service is always quick once seated
It was quite good i had the hangar steak and pommes frites (french fries) with a peppercorn sauce and grilled calamari as an appteizer
It was good
The creme brulee was really good
The butter that comes with the bread tasted as if they had just made it
however the service kind of sucked there was only one waiter and one busboy!
I dined here on a Saturday night, and was very pleased with the quality of the food
The menu offered a respectable selection, and all of us enjoyed our entrees
The wine list was long, but a bit on the high side
The host was very welcoming, but our waiter was inattentive, slow, and a touch condescending
I will go back, and will hope for a better server
I recently had dinner at chez Jacqueline, the food ambience and service are all excellent, Jacqueline is always a very gracious host
The food is always beyond expectations, if you like duck, cassoulet, sweetbreads or quails to name a few all that in the 20 dollars price range don't think twice, the wine list also has some great burgundies or bordeaux to go with that! BON APETIT!!!
After living in Monaco for six months, I returned to New York needing to find a restaurant serving good southern French cuisine
While Chez Jacqueline's food can definitely be beat outside of the country, I have yet to find any better in the States
You must try the Soupe de Poissons Traditionelle as well as the Carre d'Agneau if you want to eat what a Frenchman would
Along with everyone else, I've been going to Dojo's (West) for years
It was one of my first vegetarian havens, and it was also mighty cheap (depending on the order)
My favorites are the yakisoba vegetable (with tofu added in) and the hijiki tofu salad
Sometimes the wait staff is nice, sometimes it ain't; but it's always pretty low-key, and the food comes quickly
An excellent place to go for cheap food, relatively little wait, and decent service
The food varies in quality and tastiness, but not the place to go if your feeling especially particular anyway
Check it out sometime if you are looking for quick, cheap eats, and an interesting and wide ranging menu
I go to this Dojo's all the time
For the price you pay, you cant get any better
The food is good (not great), and you pay about $6 a plate (that's about the same as a MCDonalds value meal)
The appetizers are crazy cheap too, ranging from $2-$5
I always get the dojo dip with pita bread (tofu), and its like $3, and can serve 2 people
Definitely check it out if you want cheap good food
It gets pretty crowded and the service is not so great, but its still a great deal
I went to DoJos after walking around for an hour in the freezing cold shopping with a friend
We ordered the turkey club and veggie burger and calamari to start
The calamari was served with what looked like a mayo and thousand island greasy mix--ick
The other two dishes were so so
Nothing to write home about
But the waitress was so not friendly and in such a rush to get us out of there even though the place was more than half empty! She smacked the bill down before i had a chance to ask for dessert!
There is nothing special about Dojo West
The food is bland if not a little too salty (and I am a self proclaimed salt addict)
The service is so-so, the quality of ingredients mediochre, and the prices low
This confluence of factors allows one to consume fairly uninspired fusion food at low cost
I eat at Dojo West because I am a poor college student
Maybe that is why it is located near NYU
Note that it is a CASH ONLY establishment
I have been going to Dojo's for years
The dish I have been getting is the Hajiki Tofu Dinner, a plump, crispy patty filled with tofu and seaweed, served with rice and salad
The carrot tahini dressing is amazing! you can even buy it by the pint
I did
The Dojo Dip sandwich is great, as well as the cold sesame noodles
The home fries are fried potato wedges, a perfect side for $1!!!!! Ignore the NYU film students and enjoy
Good place to pretend you're eating healthy--they've got some pretty good brown rice
I too was not impressed by the plate of what they were calling 'chicken'
It is very reasonably priced, though--possibly worth giving it another go
When a meal ends with a pile of chicken gristle, you know it's going to be a tough night
Such is the sad state of Do-jo
At Do-jo, standard American and Japanese cuisine collide and die
The food is saltier than a sailor, and as noted above, the chicken demands serious attention, unless you like crunchy fat
It seems like a decent place to have a pitcher of beer, unless it is chicken beer

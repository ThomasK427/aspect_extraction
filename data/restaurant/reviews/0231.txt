and the fries are great too
am a huge corner bistro fan but rialto beats, especially since there is rarely a wait and it doesn't get nearly as smokey
pastas are really good as well
service can be slow when it gets crowded but the vibe is chill and the prices are fair
Love this place! The serivce is so friendly and the food is execellent
Some of the best calimari in the city I swear to God and the steak au pouve is fantastic
Try the side order of corn
Great drinks too
Went there on a Friday night for a birthday celebration and was surprised at how well the staff handled our large group
Service was great, food was delicious and the chianti almost poured itself
I had a 30th birthday party for my boyfriend for 35 people at Rialto on a Saturday night and it was phenomenal
I had the good fortune of organizing the party with Sam and Wilson who were stellar in every way
friendly and accomodating, both made the whole experience as stress free as possible
First, without my having ask, Sam and Wilson dedicated the back bar to our guests for the gathering before dinner
For the meal, we sat in the romantic outdoor area where the tables were set beautifully (fresh flowers and candles on the table
) The food was great and extremely reasonably priced and the service impeccable
Anyone who's looking knows how hard it is to find a fun but elegant venue for large groups in NY at an affordable price but THIS IS IT
Thanks to Rialto for such a memorable party
My boyfriend loved it
I came here with a few friends on a Monday night
I was very impressed
The food is excellent
Grilled corn, fresh vegetables, and plenty of seafood and meat entrees to choose from
The patio has to be the best thing about the place
It is nice and cozy, candle lit, and very good for big groups
The only thing I would recommend for this place is to serve more wine by the glass
There are only 2 or 3 options to choose from, or else you have to buy the bottle (which for most people is not a problem)
The Scene This staid yet elegant restaurant creates a dramatic atmosphere with a dark red bar, warm yellow walls, French doors and a 12-foot-tall photo collage
In hopes of attracting the swinging Euro set that frequents nearby Brown's, Amaranth offers frozen cosmopolitans in addition to bellini cocktails
The Food Renamed for an ancient herb (which in its seed form is a popular cereal grain), Amaranth serves a Mediterranean menu from Venetian chef Alberto Leandri (ex-Felidia) specializing in lots of small dishes, including everything from fried artichokes to halibut carpaccio
The few entrees are heartier, such as lobster risotto and braised short ribs with mashed potatoes
Hot looking, trendy people
The owner is friendly
Cool vibe
Food is exceptional
i was MORTIFIED by the host at this place
we finished our meal in about an hour
after a full meal (which was completely mediocre) minus dessert, my girlfriends and I continued to chat and catch up for another 10 minutes or so
the host came to our table and said, WE NEED THE TABLE, ARE YOU GOING TO GO? need i say more? jerks
You should definitely try this place
Where else can you get Portuguese food in a refined but relaxed atmosphere? The food was pretty good, generally the meat dishes are better as tempting as the seafood dishes sound
But the food was so salty the last time I went I haven't gone back
Some places aren't that great sauciers, you know? They try to make up for something lacking with too much salt
It was easier to get into than the place next door
The food was good, and the service was great
Such a great place to enjoy a quiet lunch -- they're not that busy, they have 2 walls of windows so it's nice bright, the waiter is friendly laid-back , as a Portuguese person, I can tell you the food is authentically delicious
A nice relaxing dinner if the resturant is not crowded - go on weeknights
Waiter was Portuguese - a good sign, but he didn't really know what he was doing (in a very friendly sort of way)
Probably a great place to be a regular
The wine he recommended was good
We were happier with the red meat than with the seafood, but it could have been an off-night
The whole place has a friendly familiar vibe which helps to overlook any negatives and provides an oasis from many other establishments in the area
I brought my portuguese boyfriend here when he was visiting from Toronto and Pao blew us both away
The ambience and the quality of the service were perfect, but the food was amazing
I loved that we did not feel rushed through each course and the staff was super-friendly and attentive
My boyfriend was thrilled with the food and swore it tasted exactly like the food his grandmother from Portugal cooks
I completely recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a romantic meal and authentic portuguese cuisine
I have been many times without a disappointment
The Stone Soup is excellent as are most of the seafood options
Don't miss the Acorda
went to Pao last night early and the service was great since it was not crowded in the least we arrived at 8:30 and were out by 9:30
cream of asparagus soup was yummy, and the shrimp turnovers were delicious
the steak in port sauce was really fine and went great with the sourgrape wine which was a winning recommendation from the waitress
The atmosphere is very old world, white linens and candles, very relaxing however the music being played was a cheesey mix complete with kung fu fighting a little bizarre but a nice evening nonetheless
All I have to say eat before you get there or make sure to take full advantage of the flowerpot full of complementary bread they offer
and don't be ashamed to ask for more during the hour long wait for your entrees
otherwise you'll be sorry
Stingy with portions, very expensive
not worth the hassle and belly ache!!!
Everything was scrumptious- I had lamb which, as the waitress described, was so tender it fell off the bone, and my girlfriend's cod fish was really tasty
Everything had a meditteranean feel- the food, the people, the place
My parents are from Portugal and the dishes at Pao! tasted almost as good as my mother's cooking
Really nice restaurant
Small space with a nice bar, soft lights and candles
It's got a great atmosphere
Food was good and prices are reasonable
Cool place for a date
Service is not great, but since the place is so small they are easy to grab
The shrimp soup was really good! Plus, they have a nice collection of Port for dessert
Nice restaurant
Good wine and good food at a reasonable price
Service was a little slow but overall a positive experience
In Short This uptown branch of the French Roast Cafe is virtually identical to its downtown double, with omnipresent cafes au laits served in big white bowls and a bustling, stylish crowd, great for people-watching
The menu offers light cafe fare, like grilled chicken salad served with piles of mesclun dressed in a vinaigrette
Salads and sandwiches are freshly made
Soups are also available
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there
The food was authentic
I felt as though I were eating in Paris
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive
The prices are wonderfully low
Very good wine choices
I live right near the rest so have been for both breakfast and dinner - I agree with the other reviewers - it is nothing memorable and you can get better meals a block or two away
But French Roast is perfect at 3am on a Sat night on your way home from a night out - they have great burgers
They really hit the spot
This cafe is right around the corner from my apartment and I probably eat there about twice a month
The food is decent, but not memorable, and the service when I go is never consistent
Not a bad experience - I've never had a bad meal there, but never had anything GREAT, reasonable prices, open 24 hours
I went here in the afternoon with a friend
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better

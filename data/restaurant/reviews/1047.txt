The waiter refused repeatedly
The manager said sure, we'll just charge extra
Sure
The spaghetti came, not with mozzarella on top, but rather with a separate caprese salad, and they charged me $11 extra
I brought it up with the manager who didn't see the problem
He admitted I should have been told it would cost $11 extra for my mozzarella on top request but wouldn't do anything about it; he felt that our $40/person meals represented a good value so we shouldn't care
He cited the chef/owner's policies
Pathetic
We just came back from Italy and wanted to compare notes on pasta - this place was highly recommended and had a rating of 9
4
Whereas this is a nice place with pleasant staff, the pasta was very mediocre
I guess they just don't really know how to make it as special as it is in Italy
Don't miss out on the overall experience at Bianca
The food and service were impecable
The lasagna melts in your mouth
Worth the wait
Inexpensive
Very good overall
I chose this place because I wanted a small, dark, and intimate setting
Minus the host messing up and saying that he was going to get us at the bar next door when our table was ready
and never did, everything else went flawlessly
The service was very attentive, the food was good (minus the chicken liver) and although the restaurant is really noisy with everyone chatting away and the tables being so close to each other - the only conversation I could hear was the one I was having
I will definitely go back! Plus, the bar next door is very nice too
I was surprised to read so many good reviews on a restaurant
We tried Bianca last night for the first time and it was terrific
The service is impeccable and the homemade pasta is delicious
My lover and I decided to try dinner here recently and we were very pleased with the everything about the place
The restaurant is romantic and cozy
We got there early so it was especially nice
The puff dough w/sliced Italian meats app is so good! The waiter was extremely helpful when we had questions about the menu
He also helped us select a superb red wine
My lover was extremely pleased with the choice
The prices for everything is very reasonable
Cant wait to go back for dinner again
From the ambience to the food, this was a great dining experience
All the food suggestions in the reviews are definitely true
We had the gnocchi appetizer, lasagna and the filet mignon, and it was all delicious
And if you like tartufo, they have a really great one
It's very romantic for couples and I'm sure we'll be back
My husband and I ate here on Saturday, we had a wonderful experience
It was one of the best meals we've had in the city for a long time
The lasagna was perfect, be sure to try to gnocco frito appetizer with cheese
The atmosphere and wait staff were charming
Bianca was everything it was said to be
The food was amazing and the service was what you would expect for a small and busy rest
They only take cash and no reservations so you may have to wait at the bar next door where they will come and get you
Great Value!
This is truly one of the nicest dining experiences I have had in NY
The food was delicious, I had the filet mignon
My boyfriend had the salmon, which also tasted perfect
and everyone else who has posted about the tiramisu are right on-- the best I have ever had
The place is small but with a really nice ambience
I'm so happy I discovered this place, I will definitely be back
The staff were utterly delightful and helpful, the food great - although my appetiser was a tad oily - and it's a lovely place for an intimate dinner
REMEMBER CASH ONLY! And the tables a deux are a little close together, so don't take tons of bags
some of the best italian food i've had in manhattan, especially for the price
great lasagna, great desserts! highly recommend it, and good date spot
Very good food w/ a menu to please everyone, friendly and informal service, nice ambience and an excellent value
Always crowded and for good reason, I'll definitely go back
One note, despite Citysearch saying it takes credit cards, it's actually cash only
We heard of Bianca from a New York email newsletter and decided to give it a try
We were promptly seated, and both commented on the feel of the restaurant
It's like being in an old Italian country kitchen
The waitress took our order right away, and the food was phenominal
The Gnocchi was the best we've ever had and the cream sauce was yummy, with just the right consistency
It had the best flavor
The pasta was so tender
We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert
it melts in your mouth
Hands down, the best we've ever had
The service was impeccable, very friendly and attentive wait staff
We would highly recommend Bianca to anyone, and definitely will dine there again
Absolutely excellent
Possibly one of the best restaurants we've ever eaten at
I took 2 friends earlier this week, and we were all impressed by the lovely atmosphere, friendly service and yummy food
The halibut special was a favorite, but I loved my tagliatelle bolognese, too
we'll definitely go back
Thinking back on my dining experience at Bianca makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
The waiters are courteous, they take care of you, they genuinely care about your experience
it was a revelation!  The gnocci was not great, but the tiramisu was TO DIE FOR! Seafood pasta was also very good
Had an amazing dinner at Bianca on Saturday night
Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the food was ridiculously delicious
Try the halibut special if it's available
Friendly service, great menu and reasonable prices
Would go back in a heartbeat
After reading about Bianca in the Times, we decided to try it with a small group of friends
The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating
We waited in the bar next door and they came to get us once our table was ready
The staff was great, friendly and knowledgeable and the price can't be beat!
I saw the review of Bianca in the Times and decided to give it a try
We were plesantly surprised with this small restaurant tucked away on a little visited part of Bleeker Street
Staff was very friend, although a bit slow
The food was fantastic! Each of us had a different type of very fresh homemade pasta
The wine list was great also
Both food and wine were definately affordable, especially considering the quality
To top it off the host/owner remember my name as we were leaving
Definately give it a try!

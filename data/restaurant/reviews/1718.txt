I love the giant seaweed salad with paper thin cukes, and the oshinko appetizer is big enough for four
The decor and the music is retro early nineties/late eighties, it's always a lot of fun
was 1st here 13yrs ago, impressed by the dragon panic rolls still am today
came on a date, but conversation was trying - noisy dark
food selection was good
svc could be more attentive
if you like club like atmosphere this meets your needs
but the wait for seating can be exasperating
but it is a nite scene (opens till 3am on fri/sat
)
13yrs later still going strong! The SUM IT: try at least once but expect a wait don't expect quick svc
change of pace to your typical japanese eatery
oh yeah - the food is still good
HMM
well not to mention the terrible wait I had to get inside even though we called for reservations 3 hours prior and they said it was ok
while waiting outside a bum came up to us for quick chitchat
Maybe I am being childish but that is one thing I didnt want
Food is not bad, Dessert is pretty good
Food is not bad but I would say that its not worth the effort
place is dark and I would say that not one of the best places that I ever been in
Go for the good eating of fresh sushi (and regualr japanese dishes) while you wait check out the comic book art/b-movies/retro decor/DJ spinning--and leave with a full stomach and a wallet that is not empty
If you ask me, thats closure
Good environment if you don't have much in common with your date, if you can't find a topic for conversation then you should not be allowed to leave your house--better order in
Food is cheap
it is a good value place
there is a DJ there, so it is kind of cool
service is ok
This place has rock and roll written all over it
I have never been to a sushi resturant quite like it
They make unusual awesome cocktail and the sushi is excellent!!! You can swing into the back of the resturant and see them preparing it!
What a great idea -- great (affordable!) sushi, cool music, great ambience, terrific service, and fun people
In an awesome neighborhood right near the park, as well
Bottle of white wine, 3 rolls, 2 pieces sushi, and 2 appetizers was $40
10+ on value!
Don't expect great sushi if you visit here
I was atleast looking forward to a fun atmosphere, but was disappointed with that as well
Tried about every roll and didn't find any reason to return
A classic NYC way of blending sushi, art, and music
The food is great, music gets you dancing in your seat (techno remixes), there is always a good movie on, and don't forget the sushi art and hung up art
I could drink sake there all night
as long as your okay with veg food, and are not looking for a sit down
It's called Punjabi Deli, and it's just that
No-nonsense Indian soul food, good and cheap
I recommend getting Chana (chickpeas) with Samosa but it's all wonderful
The people who work there are great too
Another plus is: open 24 hours
!$2!
Punjabi has been one of my favorite Indian holes-in-the-wall for some right now
Don't bother with Pak Punjab or some of the other Houston street hindi-spoons
This is the real deal
$3 gets you a bowl of rice topped with one of 5 (or so) tasty, homemade vegetarian dishes
Add another buck and get a plate with bread and lettuce
Always packed with local cab drivers and in-the-know Villagers, this place is an affordable gem not to be overlook at 2 am or 12 pm
As one of my close Indian friends says: Mmm
just like home!
The Scene Portraits of mothers cover the walls at this appropriately named East Village spot
Mismatched tables and chairs make for a lovable afterthought of a dining room; one that's close enough to the kitchen that you can hear the cooks hacking away at chickens during prep time
Mama's clientele is extremely loyal--regulars are greeted by name
The Food Mama's serves up overflowing plates of Southern-style comfort food
Though any marginally competent home cook could whip up a meal of comparable quality with ease, Mama's food is undeniably tasty
And the low prices make it only a little more expensive than raiding your parents' refrigerator
Choose an entree (salmon, catfish, meatloaf, fried chicken) and a few sides (macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, pasta salad, grits) to create your own cholesterol-laden meal
Maybe it's better in the restaurant - I've never been - but the delivery is kinda crummy
Lukewarm, greasy food and vegetables sit in a pool of oily water that leaks through the bag
I won't order again
I've been searching for a place to get good southern, comfort food
I came upon the reviews through Citysearch and was extremely excited about going to Mama's due to the 9
2 rating
I went into the buffet style ordering counter, got my plate and was surprised when I bit into a cold plate of chicken and sweet potato
I did however LOVE the Mac and Cheese, because lets be honest, you can't eat Mac Cheese Cold
Maybe it was the cold weather outside that was drifting into the restaurant as the food is right by the door, but no one should have to eat a cold dinner
The food here is excellent and portions are huge
Not many people can finish an entree with 2 sides
I order Mama's in at least once a week! The portions are large, the salmon is the best I've had in the area (very plain but- gasp!- not dry at all), and you can't beat the price
$9 gets you two huge sides and a great big hunk of whatever meat you want
I think of it this way- I usually pay $13 on average for a piece of salmon half that size
The long list of sides includes great favorites (like mac n' cheese or mashed potatoes) and some new ones with a twist (broccoli with whole pieces of roasted garlic or cous cous)
I typically opt to get delivery just because I'd rather eat it in my apartment rather than the actual restaurant, but either way, you're paying the same- tip the waiter or tip the delivery guy! And either
treated like garbage, then try Mama's
The baked chicken and mashed potatoes are really good, but the service stank
For my hard-earned cash I am going to find someplace else where I can at least be treated well
I won't get into name calling, but you will see what kind of staff they have when you get there
Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend Mama's for a first date
Only for a good friend who you like to try new things (no uptight people)
Also, most of the food isn't really southern, but just regular homecooked food
I mean couscous isn't southern at all!!!
Mama's has the most delicious meatloaf and mashed potatoes
These are a definite must try
The sweet peas are also garlicky and yummy
The salmon tends to run out early
This place is so cheap and worth it
You get whopping big portions
Sit outside in nice weather in old school desks, it's too cramped inside
Yeah, the food is cheap, but the whole heat it up in the microwave thing, freaked me out
Too low budget for me
If you want good cheap grub, go to any cuchifrito in the city, or hit up the outer boroughs for some decent comfort food, where the space is clean and sanitary
Plus, the food was just OK
nothing spectacular
The food is tasty, especially the mac n'cheese
However, each item is mass-prepared and sits out without being heated (which I personally find disgusting), so your food is likely to come cold or luke-warm at best

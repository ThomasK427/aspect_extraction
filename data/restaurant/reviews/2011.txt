Food was also good, but nothing special
Though I do think that the desserts were excellent
If you can afford to eat at fancy places like this often, then I recommend it
But if you do it once in a while, there is a lot better fine dining in NY
We went to Bouley for my Birthday, and the overall experience was simply so so
First, the average age of the diners must be in their 70s, and several looked like they were going to do a face plant in their fish
Return from Chiang Mai should have been called Return to Kitchen
No joke, the jelly like ensemble must have been prepared a week in advance, and the so called lobster was essentially non-existent
The black sea bass with encrusted scallops was not only original, it was divine
I highly recommend ordering this
The only other negative, we found the waiter to be slightly pompous, and when I asked him some very basic wine questions, he was lost
Spend your money elsewhere
overall, wonderful experience, but
ambience is great - romantic, unique inviting
just right
service was just right too - attentive without being overzealous
and the food was good - but not superlative
and at these prices, it should be
boyfriend and i both got the tasting menu
kobe beef should not be texas kobe at a restaurant of this caliber
return to chiang-mai or whatever it was called was a bit indecipherable
deserts were fantastic - the standout
but a bit too little too late
like i said, overall experience was wonderful
but somethin isn't right if i feel more satisfied after a meal at houston's than at a restaurant like bouley
good thing work was paying
I went to Bouley for the first time since their reopening
I had a very nice experience overall, great service, fantastic wine, and very comfortable atmosphere, but food was a little inconsistent
One dish would be Wow, and then the next course would be plain, needing more salt and seasoning
One sauce would be very rich and tasty but the other would be overkilled by herbs, etc
I've had better experiences at Bouley so I would probably go back though
i came here a few months ago for an early valentine dinner
we both had the $95 tasting menu
i started with the return to chiang mai which consisted of cool lobster tail mango in a fruit-flavoured sauce
it was really good, but i also mistakenly chose the lobster course as my entre and it turned out to be the same dish as my appetizer (but warmed)
i thought that was pretty funny, though im not sure that my bf was as amused
the rest of the food was good, though not particularly memorable
service was attentive
seating was comfortable though the seats were sort of low and there was too much table space between us to be romantic
ive heard good things about the prix fixe lunch, so maybe ill come again for that
a dense loaf of fruit cake came with our check a nice ending
My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner here and I must say that I was blown away
From the entry to the ambience to the dinner itself, it was excellent
Perfect place for romantic dining!
A special evening for a party of six
The fragrance of apples and the anticipation of the meal make one's mouth water before being seated
Personal service that makes you feel special and menu selections that were varied enough to please everyone
My only disappointment occurred at the end of the meal
as we exited the restaurant we happened to look accross the street, into the second floor windows above the Bouley Bakery
There was David Bouley cooking up a storm for the patrons of the cafe/bistro above the bakery
If I had only known
one of the Bakery staff was kind enough to take one of the restaurant menus and get David Bouley to autograph it for me
If Bouley is a little too expensive, stop in the bakery accross the street, the lemon cake and blueberry muffins are to die for
who knows who will be cooking upstairs
food here is ridiculously good
yes, RIDICULOUSLY good
however the overall experience falls short of being ridiculously fabulous due to seemingly trivial things -- small things that really add up
example1: everytime i have been there it has been NOTICEABLY (either) too hot or too cold
i should NOT be wishing i had not coat checked my scarf and wondering where the air duct causing the draft is located
example2: waterstained and fingerprint smudged sterling silver flower vase
gross! example3: WHY are the chairs SO LOW? everyone looks silly and appear to be straining to shovel world class food into their mouths
I have gone to this place for lunch and dinner and is one of my favorite restaurants
It is great for a romantic evening
The food is very good and the ambience is nice and romantic
You even get a little gift when you leave
How cute is that!
The food was good
Nothing that made me say wow, until the desserts, that is
For the money you pay, you'd expect more robust and flavorful dishes, which unfortunately doesn't happen at Bouley
The ambiance is great, however, the food needs to be stepped up a few notches to be worth the price
Bouley defines what fine dining should be
The food is exceptional in every respect and is well known to be among the finest in the city
The cuisine is matched by immaculate service that is both warm and attentive
Bouley is as good as it gets
We had a truly excellent lunch
For $ 48, you get a 4 course tasting menu, with every course on the same height as all the others
Outstanding, if pricey wine list, but they offer good wines by the glass that matched the food very well
Very attentive, but unobtrusive service, with several waiters from France which gives the restaurant an extra atmosphere of culture and European refinement rarely found in New York
I'd give them 4 Michelin stars, for the quality of food and its presentation, their lack of pretentiousness, and the relaxed atmosphere
We were just happy
Friday lunch drew a mostly older (50+) crowd
For $35, amuse of beet root gelee with mascarpone cream and almond foam was texturally pleasant if a bit sweet
Appetizer of pan-fried skate and mushroom ragout was over-salted - ironically, some sweetness here would have helped balance
Entree of roast chicken with demi-glace was executed well and the puree of fingerling potatoes was ethereal
An interlude of pear soup with chestnut sorbet was over-chilled to the point of dullness
Then, a plethora of dessert riches - given choice of chocolate souffle or pineapple meringue I ended up with both, and it was the meringue that blew away the cloyingly sweet souffle
One other complimentary dessert, petit fours, and a cake to take home! Overall, a decent but not outstanding lunch, with a lot of extra desserts thrown in
Just enough to entice me back for dinner one day
My friend I were very excited about going to Bouley for their tasting menu during lunch today
I was very disappointed
The waiter were staring at us as if we were Aliens
The canape was horrible
The tomatoes were not fresh
The baby skate fish was too salty
The cod was somewhat over cooked
The only things that was good was the souffle
Overall, I would not recommend Bouley and needless to say may not patron this
The food at Bouley is worthy as is the decor
That is where the great experience ends
The Sommelier doesn't understand wine and it's relationship to food

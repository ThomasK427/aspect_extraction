This place cant get better!! The atmosphere is great, the people and the music
The late night sunday dancing is great with good looking people and fun atmosphere
If you like the small yet fulfilling environment with great people and music then this is the place to go
Everything started well that night
We got our table on time and this place has a nice setting
Food was good
A bit pricey if anything, but good
The evening got almost ruined when the female maitre d' tried to kick us out of our table while we wanted to order another round of drinks
She couldn't have handled the situation any worse
Rude, no respect whatsoever
What does such a restaurant gain of behaving so badly? Not much as far as we are concerned, we won't return!
I had heard so many things about this restaurant that I decided to try it with a group of friends
I will not waste anyone's time with any description of the bad food we had
The service was terrible, it was like we were not even there
Even to order a THIRD bottle of a $50
00 bottle of wine, we had to endure the waiter's attitude, like he was doing us a solid, if you're into huge Euro crowds and don't care about what you eat and how it is served to you, Baraonda is your kind of place
Dinner at Baraonda is a nice, relaxing night out
The pastas are hearty and delicious, the salads are fresh and inventive, and the atmosphere is loud but cozy
I've gone back a couple of times now, and am never disappointed!
Baraonda has the best gnocchi (potato pasta) i've ever had, and i've been to Rome
The seating is VERY cramped and perhaps uncomfortable at times but the food makes up for it
Sunday nights are always fun until you get the $3000 bill for the bottles
All in all, give it a shot
My heart begins to hurt when I imagine what they had in mind while creating this restaurant, but it sadly runs in a state of confusion while trying to find its identity
The decor is clearly Latin, as is most of the unbearably loud music, but the cuisine is more of a mixture between Italian and French
A blink-and-you-missed, tiny bar lines the lefthand side wall as you enter, which is packed with neighborhood hipsters, but it sadly interferes with the tables filled with dining patrons that are forking out mega bucks for mediocre fare
From start to finish, my experience at Baraonda was horrific
Reservations were at 7:30, they called at 7:25 with an attitude to ask if we were coming
Sat us at a table for 6 even though we had 9 in our party
Once dinner was served, the waiter didn't come back for over 45 minutes
Obviously the blonde who greets people at the door is more concerned with flirting with the clientele then serving tables
I was appalled by the entire experience and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
this place is such a fun place to be
if you are looking for some quiet place, Baraonda is not for you
all the waiters were very friendly
it was very crowded, so we didn't really get prompt service, but we didn't mind it at all! from appertizer to dessert, everything was very delicious
i will go there again
on weekend, it's better to make a reservation
What might strike you, as a colorful and artsy place with a somewhat interesting sounding menu; it will soon dawn on you when you sit down in this loud, badly organized and horrific place that you just entered Freddys equivalent of the Elm Street Diner located on 75th and 2nd
Not only do you have to put up with horrific service (our waiter was taught by another how to open the wine bottle!), dull food but also you most likely will be an expert in mime, as you cant possibly keep a conversation with your date/friend
Baraonda is a great place to have dinner
I went there with a few friends and my son for my birthday and the service was fantasic, the food was even better! Their rasberry creme brulee is to die for! If you haven't been here you have to go at least once
My son ordered steak and it a huge! We really enjoyed out time there
The place is packed which is no big deal
Baraonda means chaos and that's what you get
You have to accept that going in
Subpar food is the issue
I had the pan seared tuna
At $24 you expect a nice piece of tuna
What I got looked like scraps
Not good
The tuna didn't taste fresh and the vegetables were about the same
Sunday nights are so much fun with dancing after you eat
The food is delicious, the wait staff is friendly and they play fun music! I would definitely recommend!
I was expecting a great dish with reliable service from all the hoopla I heard about this place
I was sorely dissappointed
The food took forever almost 45 minutes and was cold when I got it
Our waiter actually turned another table before we got ours
He was not attentive and didn't even ask how our dish was
One place I'm definately not going back to
Staff are good-looking, and for an Eastside restaurant, it is hip
I found the food characterless, except Tiramisu, which was one of the best in town
I was annoyed how often I was bumped into whilst dinning
Perhaps too many tables for the small establishment?
Haven't ever been here on a weekend, but i went for dinner on a weeknight
It wasn't too crowded or too noisy
really nice atmosphere for a night out with friends
the food was actually pretty good, and the service was okay
the wine menu was pretty pricey, and the bill definitley added up quickly! Not bad for an east side restaurant, though
Located on the corner of Second Avenue and 75th Street, this Mediterranean flavored restaurant offers nights full of fun but dishes empty of flavor
It is mostly known for its dancing and loud music towards the late hours of the evening also it is nicely decorated with drawings and paintings in red tones
Late diners can witness the transformation of this restaurant to a dance club, if you are willing to have a pretty late dinner
It is a nice place to visit for drinks or even maybe some appetizers but if you are looking for a dining experience skip this place
Menu is mostly Mediterranean influenced but some how pretty blend
Safe choices would be pasta or pizza
Eat somewhere else; come for the dancing and drinks
This place is awesome if you live close by
Everything I've had here has been really good (especially their gyros)
They're open pretty late (I think 1:AM) and the food is actually quality food for a diner
The people who work here are really nice and they actually get pretty busy at times
If you live in this area--this is definitely a place to check out
They have basically every kind of food you could want
A plethora of salads, breakfast foods, sandwiches, burgers, greek food, italian, seafood, EVERYTHING
yes, they give you a gently service, and very healthy food at reasonable prices
I go there at least twice a week
It is my favorite place for diet while eating delicious! the oriental guys are the sweetest waiters in town
I'm Vietnamese and I've had a hard time finding a good Viet restaurant
The food here is interesting
authentic, but not put together how we would normally do it--but it just makes it a more interesting meal! The quality of the food is superb
The Chilean sea bass was AMAZING
Ambience is nice
Service is superior
We felt very well attended to
Wine was good too! I'm glad we tried this place for valentines day
This is not just one of the best vietnamese restaurants, but is one of the best restaurants overall in NYC
Its food is consistently d-e-e-e-lcious
The ambience is great, and service is fantastic
It will please a romantic date or a large group
I have eaten here several times and each and after each time I am more convinced that it is one of the CITY's best picks if overall for food, ambience, service and value
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

However, everything else about the experience left us soured, from being seated in the cavernous back room - far from the much-discussed soaring ceilings - to the spotty service that disrupted the flow of our conversation and enjoyment of our meal
The accustics were maddening - we easily overheard diners seated several tables away from us
The tables were too close together and the server made several mistakes with our meal, including making us wait over fifteen minutes for our check - after we asked for it! I thought maybe our experience was a singular gaff, but a table of four seated next to us complained as well and argued pretty fiercely about whether the server even deserved a tip!
The Restaurant Week menu is quite nice with around ten options for the first and second courses instead of the usual two or three
For starters I had the seafood raviolis (small but excellent) and my girlfriend the chilled asparagus soup which she liked
The main courses were a little sloppy with my fish being slightly overcooked and hers being accompanied by an (optional) overpowering parsley sauce but the other spices and accompaniments went well
For desert I had an amazing frozen blueberry cheesecake with warmed blueberries and she had an average pistachio ice cream
The service though was great and the space is pleasing and airy as always
it seems that i had high expectation of this place
first of all decor is simple yet elegant which i like
food wasn't so good that makes me want to go back
but i think it could be the very bad, slow service that ruined my appetite
for that price i expect better value for my money
i was very very disappointed with wait staff's service
My boyfriend and I went to Eleven Madison Park for dinner tonight and were sorely disappointed
We had been there last year for brunch, which was great
We waited 20 minutes for our table
We were ignored by our waitress after our entrees had been served
During dessert, my coffee cup remained empty for at least 10 minutes before I had to ask for a second cup
My boyfriend's squid appetizer was fair
My entree of beef cheeks was extremely fatty and miniscule
Dessert was fair, but we didn't get the little petit fours that other tables received
All in all a sub par experience
I've never been to a restaurant that is so cheap with their coffee
My friends and I went there for brunch and each of us had to ask for our coffee to be refilled repeatedly as we see the waiter stand there watching us eat!! My friend ordered the fluke but the waiter decided to give her the mahi mahi instead
When we informed the waiter that that was not what we ordered, he then told us they ran out of the fluke
My french toast was two fried pieces of french bread
Overall food quality? decent
Ambiance? i have to admit, it's there
Service? you get more attention at a diner
I went there with a group of friends
None of the food struck our nerves as being delectable and definitely wasn't worth the price
The tuna tartar was bland and came in 4 thin strips
My chicken entree was the only medium portioned entree and despite the first bite being savory, the inner pieces were dry
The ravioli entree had 3 pieces! the venison came with 4 thin slices, the lobster- one tail, the duck- shreds, and the artic fish entree looked incredibly small as well
To top it off, we got three orders of chocolate souffle which we assumed would be a normal dessert and ~12
00
Shockingly, the souffle is bigger than two entrees combined! The first few bites were OK, like a mushy chocolate brownie, but got very heavy and none of us could finish it
Imagine our chagrin when we saw the price- 72
00 for 3 souffles!!
This was an amazing experience
The bar is beautiful and the atomosphere refined
The wine steward was excellent
He brought over quite a few bottles for us to taste so that we could pick the perfect wine and spirits for our meal, for every course! The food was superb and I look forward to finding a reason to go
11 Madison was a wonderful dining experience
the menu was so full of intersting and palatable(!) dishes - so unique but pleasurable
it was elegant, lively
even romantic with and without my mate!i've been back a couple times after my first experience was so divine
even once just for dessert and wine! defintely a 10 among the mass eateries in the big apple
my first visit to a danny meyer restaurant
very good experience
our waitress, amy, was very helpful
everything was good, especially the bread
the skate was excellent
so was the steak
the desserts were great
this place is on par with gramercy tavern, my favorite restaurant
but gramercy is still the best
We have been to Eleven Mad
Park now on 3 occasions, all have been excellent
Service is always friendly, food is always wonderful, and the ambiance is lovely
One night we landed at the bar for a late night dinner, and the hanger steak and frites w/ marjoram aioli was the BEST
I love the 3oz
or 6oz
different wines by the glass, and the lovely cheese puffs/gougeres are out of this world! Addictive! I have enjoyed each of Danny Meyer's restaurants, but this is my favorite
I look forward to dining there again tomorrow evening!
Eleven Madison is my recommendation for special occasion dining
Khalid, one of their servers had remembered me from my previous dining experience there (over a year ago!)
Needless to say, the service is superb
The food even better --- Kerry the chef came out to personally meet his diners
I recommend anything on the menu, especially the cheese puffs, the skate, and make sure you order the chocolate souffle! One week after my 2nd visit to 11 Mad, I received a thank you letter from the chef
This place is above and beyond!
A+++
I went there around 6pm during the week - on purpose, so it'd be less noisy - and had a wonderful experience
Everyone was smiling, from the hostesses to the waitstaff, and so pleasant
The service was prompt and courteous and we were never left waiting for our wine, entrees or the check
Loved the feel of the place - perfect for a business dinner
Did I mention our food was absolutely delicious? All three of our entrees were tastier than we could've asked for
We left around 8pm just as things were picking up (along with the noise), and our exit was just as warm as our entrance: all smiles and thank yous as we left
Definitely recommend this restaurant and I'm certain I'll return
(I know I sound like I work for the place, but it really was that good
)
My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at this well-known restaurant
My earlier skepticism that Eleven Mad could be the typical overly en-mode restaurant actually turned out to be an extremely inviting and comfortable atmosphere
The attentive staff truly lifted the experience and the food lived up to its reputation as a great culinary showcase
Great place for an anniversery, or special event - the room is beautiful, the service is very attentive without being aloof and the food is devine
The portions are just right (although I'm sure out-of-towners would be dissappointed by the size
)  There's a french influence to the food but I've no idea why the previous review got so twisted up, they don't claim to be french at all
Oh and don't miss the souffle
!
Went to this establishment with a french female trying to impress her with my knowledge of french food and wine
Unfortunately, this place didn't help
The food was dull and uninteresting
I don't think just giving you small servings necessarily constitutes being french cuisine
Later that evening I was informed that it was not really french food, but just a restaurant claiming to serve french food
I was very disappointed with the overall experience and needless to say I went home alone that evening
Great meal
Wonderful place where you can hear each other speak
The chocolate souffle for dessert is an experience unto itself
This place is so nice

Just imagine rigatoni STUFFED with veal and vegetables in a light tomato sauce
Service is very personal and personable
Go!
For someone that does not like to eat/go out, I must say that I finally found a restaurant that has a romantic, warm and inviting atmosphere-- with great food!! The maitre'd is always willing to help guide my family and I through the menu
The pasta dishes are delicious
Pasta alla vongole is a favorite
The polenta with sausage meat sauce is to die for
The pork chops w/balsamic, pan roasted apples and pears is out of this world
I discovered Degrezia a year ago and my wife loves me for it because it's the only place I'll ever take her
Great Food, Good Wine and Nice People!!! Si Mangia Bene!!!
I was thinking I am gonna have a nice dinner in that place that a friend of mine recommended to me , but beside the expensive prices that it has was nothing more
I had a bussines dinner there but it's a shame
Nice place to say but service was bad and we had problems with the food
I wouldn't recommend to nobody
I have been dining there for years and it keeps getting better
All I could say is the food was always very good, but now it's better than ever
The waiter mentioned to us the menu was changed in jan
and everyone is flipping over it
So if your in the area, you have to stop in, if you love great italian food and good service
We can't wait to go back Enjoy
This is a nice place; no doubt
Quiet, sophisticated, spacy, quiet but not very exciting
But who needs that? We had a run through of the menu choosing both from the specials and the classics and it was good, but not more
Nothing lifted us to higher grounds
Good wine list (and extensive) but weak on the white wines (for some reasons)
Service was good but nothing special
The bill for three persons (incl tip) for a drink, a bottle of wine, starter and main course, dessert and coffee was $300
Not that bad
I advise you however to stay away from the buffalo mozzarella which is extremely over rated (and actually quite sub standard)
But it's a nice (and very civilized) place
I just don't understand why I should come back
This is one of the finest restaurants in the city, bar none

The experience we had at this restaurant was second to none
The ambiance, food and service were great but this is NOT cheap by any standards
My wife and I shared a meal, appetizer, and dessert with two glasses of the house wine and our meal came up to $85
It was a magnificent experience
The food is great and their wines
The decor was pretty nice and the food was full of flavor
The prices are a bit pricey because entrees don't come with nan or rice, they need to be separately ordered
So they add up
However, if you go between noon to 3pm on the weekdays, everything on the menu during lunch time is 50% off
It's a great deal then
A favorite place for me and my boyfriend
Warm, inviting atmosphere, great food, beautiful dinnerware
Never seen the place with more than a few tables
Service is knowledgeable, professional, but somewhat disinterested
Portions are also relatively small
bear that in mind if you're really starving
A great place for lovers of Indian food looking for a warm, relaxing meal
better for dining with friends/significant others
I visited the 53rd St
Baluchi's for lunch today, 2/10/05 (2nd visit)
The food is average and they give you no complimentary breads, etc
like the other Indian restaurants do
The value is great, BUT the service is horrible
On my first visit, I asked the waiter to please wrap my leftovers and was refused adamantly (he told he wasn't allowed to package the low-priced food)
And, today's lunch visit (experience) was just as horrific
I was rushed out so the waiters could set up for dinner
They even went so far as to sweep dirt behind my chair (hint, hint) and clear my dinnerware right out from under my nose
If they felt they needed the table, then they shouldn't have been so greedy as to accept my service at 2:45 pm only to have to rush me out at 3:15 pm for the dinner set up
The food wasn't that great
But it's a cool looking place and there's a great scene
I've returned only for the bar
It's always packed upstairs at night on the weekend
Sukus is like an oasis in the middle of noisy over crowded Bars of second avenue
It is a small cozy place where one could relax and enjoy the evening with friends for a reasonable price
It has soothing ambiance that is supplemented by soft background music and a friendly service
The best of all was the authentic Indian cuisine that is not very greasy or spicy
They have some unique items like Flat Nan bread with cheese and tasty toppings, that is defiantly better that any Pizza I have tried
They also serve grilled vegetables and Seafood platter that is unique to Sukus
The Owner personally came as a host and explained the food items to us; he had some very interesting stories about the culinary history of India
Visit to this place is must for all
Ignominiously located on Second Avenue in the 50s, Clay Oven offers some surprisingly good Indian food that is better than most that I've tried in the City
There isn't much on the menu that is unique to Clay Oven, but it all is consistently very good
The breads are particularly good, and the disehs aren't so saturated with ghee that you feel bloated after eating them -- most of the food is deliciously light
Definitely sticks out in terms of the type of crowd it attracts
Let's just say that if you're looking for a place to take your grandfather for a few drinks, you won't find a better alternative in Manhattan
The crowd is mainly senior citizens as are the waitstaff
Prices are a little high, $5
00 for Coors Light, but then again you're appealing to a crowd with no real need to save
There's a bar area and a seating area for dining in the back
No music gets played and there is a TV in front although it wasn't on when we were there
Menu is mainly seafood however if you order the chicken it will take about 45 minutes to cook
If you're under 40, while it might be good for curiousity, not worth your time
A neat neighborhood Irish pub! Feels like you've stepped back in time but it's warm, comfortable and the food is good! Had some of the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had
And, the chicken, as another reviewer said, is worth the 20 mintue wait
Service is pleasant and attentive and the $$$ are entirely reasonable
Yeah, the patrons are mature but we're all getting there, aren't we? And, we still like to eat, right? Well, here's a friendly neighborhood place to do just that and enjoy it!
I had a great meal at this restaurant
I don't think the $$$$ is fair since most of the entrees are under $22
The restaurant has a wonderful Irish staff that nows what they are doing
Once inside, you feel as if you've just driven down a cobbled street in Ireland and settled into a cozy village local
The warmth comes not just from the paneled walls and deep burgundy upholstery, but also from all the staff- everyone from New York's original leprechaun, Jimmy Neary himself, to the cheerful and welcoming coat room attendant
They always have a number of fresh fish specials, as well as the 'standards' for which they are famous
Their half a roast chicken is to die for' and well worth the 20 minute wait
The crowd is mature, and it's great to see so many older Irish eyes smiling

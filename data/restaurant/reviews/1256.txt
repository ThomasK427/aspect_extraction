The dumplings were decent, and the people I was with all thought their meals were above average if not exceptional
Over all, I would definitely go there again many times, but would NEVER order out from there again
I can't even believe the food was from the same restaurant! But eating in was great!
?????Fusion?? i dont get it  too much chili garlic in the spicy tuna
The Scene Clever design touches, like glittering crystals, hang over the bread-splayed bar
Plastic candy shop containers stuffed with dehydrated fruits and vegetables keep the white-on-white interior from seeming sterile
Despite the doily place mats and frilly eyelet wall pattern, the crowd is decidedly more leather than lace
The Food Chef Iacopo Falai's light and inventive menu stands out for its pure, nimble flavor combinations
Astonishingly fresh Buffalo ricotta forms a flan-like mold and harmonizes perfectly with a drizzle of hazelnut oil and the crunch of crisp snowpeas; ethereal rounds of spinach and ricotta gnudi gracefully embrace a butter and sage sauce; and large, firm langoustines swim in a dainty shell fish consomm
Desserts show equal poise, with a row of tiny, flaky profiteroles filled with chocolate and marsala cream, and a delicate almond foam and cocoa butter panacotta, topped with brittle slivers of dehydrated strawberry
I'll admit it
I spend way too much on food in NYC, but listen
if you are going to do it, do it here
Yeah Yeah, so the location is a bit tired, but they make up for it 1000 times over
I love the service, and I love the food
It's just all around terrific, and I will continue to go as much as I can afford! Thanks for a great new spot to be a regular!
The food is absolutely amazing
All the pastas are made fresh daily, and everything I had was fantastic
Warning, you are supposed to order multiple dishes, so if you order just an entree per person you probably won't have enough
Just order a few of the excellent pastas to split among everyone, and you'll be just fine
It did take a while to get seated, but it's a small restaurant and the staff were all extremely friendly
The white decor was great, like being in some mod Italian film
Overall, a very hip restaurant with great food and friendly servers
Falai is great
So it is small, hot and loud
But that is a part of the ambiance
As a matter of fact, i read this review from the real deal and pondered why there would only be one meat dish on the menu
It turns out this reviewer was full of ****
The menu has 3 meat dishes to offer as well as a number of fish dishes and many homemade pastas
I highly recommend Falai
This website is for reviews, not complaints
The servers were all very friendly, and i highly doubt they would say something like you people
Hell if you came to a restaurant i worked at mr
real deal i would say you people too
Falai: great service
delicious beautiful dishes
Too hot, too loud, but worth it!
I'm sure opening a restaurant is tough and all
I'd be awful at it, so I have never tried
Beyond the white decor, small portions bratty staff (yes, bratty is the word here), Falai is so LOUD
When full, the place sounds like the inside of a jet engine: bare walls + bare floor + open kitchen = LOUD
The food was OK, very expensive
Now for the bad story, because I promised my table of 6 I would tell it here: For parties of 6 or more there is a limited menu, check, no problem
The only meat on this menu was a Short Rib which seemed a little rich for 96 degree weather
When one person at the table mentioned he'd rather have another meat dish (a substitution yes, but a single one) the manager cried you people and turned on his heels to storm away
Our poor waitress was shocked and I almost got up an left
My friends assured me it was worth the tude and we continued to an extremely small, extremely rich Short Rib while sweating bullets in a crowded cafeteria
Never will be back, and would actually persuade those planning on going to go to another place
Or is there anything more annoying than 2 people next to you staring at you every second of the meal, listening to your every word and not talking amongst themselves? I guess we were just interesting to listen to, but they weren't, and we wish we had more than 6 inches of space
They laughed when we asked for the Sommalier who recommended the first bottle on the menu which was absolutely mediocre, Try Again
The starters were fine, but nothing exciting (Scallops for her and Liver for me) The liver had a dash of brilliance but the polenta cube it was sitting on was detracting from the meat
The wine perfectly crushed any flavors that were in the mood
Main courses were equally lackluster
Why are people raving about Gnudi? It tastes like a clump of uncooked dough
My date left two on her plate and they weren't exciting enough for me to snatch them up--and I eat anything
My Short Rib was actually very good as were the presentations of all dishes, but after a few bites, we were over Falai
The atmosphere is nice for about 5 seconds and then you want to be out--enough white already
There is no intimacy or even a hint of romantic ambience--unless you get the table outside perhaps--it was empty the whole night? I wish we could have given dessert a chance but I have a feeling we were going from bad to worse
In summary, Falai is not horrible, it's actually fine, for what it is--almost upscale
Warning--The people next to us might be sitting next to you--they are regulars--Beware :)
Good authentic Italian food and portions and good choice of wine
Unfortunately, the service is far behind
Even with reservation, it might take up to one hour to get a table and the staff might not even say a word about it
The staff is not very attentive; our waitress did even not know basic Italian drinks nor did she know how to pronounce it
There is a lot of room for improvement
Unfortunately, the food is the only outstanding quality of this place
After visiting Falai several times over the last year, I must say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in New York
The food is always full of flavor, artfully presented and just generally outstanding! Although the space is small, and can be quite crowded, it remains charming and very fitting for the neighborhood
The staff can get overwhelmed, but they manage to make up for it with friendly attitudes and helpful suggestions
All in all, I highly recommend Falai to anyone thats looking for something special on the Lower East Side
The biggest problem I have with this resteraunt is the portions are tiny
I mean seriously I shouldn't have to go out for dinner after dinner
It was really that small
Entrees were the size of small appetizers
If your super rich and have the wallet to order several appetizers and several entrees then knock yourself out you may have found a winner
The atmosphere was alright, relatively warm for a stark white room
No waiting during the week and the flavors of the food was pretty tasty
But we left there with light wallets and even lighter stomaches
Although the food was absolutely incredible, we were disappointed with the sommelier
He was very heavy handed so much so he poured off our first bottle of wine before we were even finished w/our appetizers
Decor - too white, too bright
Food - excellent, especially the short ribs and the chocolate dessert
service - good
I will be back
We went last night and what an experience! Relaxing Italian minimalist decor with marble and tile and a friendly staff who re-arranged the schedule to accomodate us
The food was out of this world
We had the octopus app
which was soft, and flavorful
For the main course, I had the short ribs (meal of the night) which melt in your mouth
Wifey had the squid ink pasta which was also excellent
For dessert, we had profiteroles with chocolate sauce
Price wasn't bad
I just wish there was more food as I left a little hungry
Say Yes to the bread they bring! The portions are a little small, even by European standards
I made reservations after reading all the rave reviews, and my boyfriend and I got the little table in the front window - cozy and away from the bustle of the rest of the restaurant
Our waiter was exceptionally attentive and the food was very good - inventive and different from your standard italian restaurant
I enjoyed the whole experience very much and highly recommend it - only drawback, they have only italian wines available
one more to get in and enjoy very much, i love it, me and my boyfriend will became regualr ( i wish i didn't have to go away for work so much
nice wines and delicious presentation of this little culinary experrience
bravo!!!

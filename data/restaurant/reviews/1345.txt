With all there restaurants to choose from in this neighborhood you'd think at least their service would be good
What a disappointment! While we were promptly seated, we waited a long time to have delivered to our table a breakfast that was unappetizing to look at and, at least with the biscuits and gravy, inedible (biscuits were hard as rocks and gravy was dark brown with mushrooms like you would serve over a steak)
My boyfriend's chicken fried steak was edible but he said not exactly good
I have never sent a meal back in my life but this time I did
The only positive to the entire dining experience was that the waitstaff willingly agreed not to charge for the meal
I would encourage anyone to stay clear of this restaurant
It is nice to go with a couple or a large group of people
Food is great and affordable
I especially like rose roll and tempra roll! Try these with a white wine!
Turquoise is an interesting blend of smart-chic Israeli Riviera meets cafeteria
It's a small, cozy, overly-lit room with an equally small, but comfortable, bar at the entrance
It's attractive with a clean, fresh look
Although the room had empty tables my date and I opted to sit at the bar
This also gave us the opportunity to watch as patrons came and went
The menu has an extensive array of fish so if you are a seafooder you'll enjoy it here
There are also a variety of salads (we saw a few being delivered - they are large, too)
After a few relaxing drinks we ordered the baba ganoush and baked clam appetizers
Both were delicious
Followed by the Israeli salad, just the right blend of those simple ingredients
Finally we shared the scallops and a side dish of beets
The scallops were perfectly cooked and flavorful
The dishes are very plainly plated on whiteware
All in all, an enjoyable experience
If they lowered the lights a bit it might actually be romantic
The meal (with drinks cappucinos) came to $95
I went here with my fianc on a Friday night back in February
We had a late 9:30 pm reservation; when we arrived and went to be seated, there was some type of discrepancy since the hostess was missing in action
This resulted in us standing in a small entrance way in the front of the restaurant (they wouldn't allow anyone else to seat us except for the hostess) for awhile which was weird since I felt like we were in the way of people entering and exiting the restaurant
However, about five minutes later (although it seemed much longer) the hostess showed up and seated us
The wait was all worth it after experiencing the exceptional service and food
My fianc had tilapia stuffed with crabmeat and shrimp and I had a combination platter of scallops and sea bass flavored with white wine, lemon, garlic, and capers
My combination platter was a custom creation of the owner's after he sat down and welcomed us personally! THE FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING
The fish was cooked to perfection; the salads are also highly recommended (the Greek salad was the best I've ever had; the Israeli salad was also very good and it was different from the norm)
The wine list was good
As far as atmosphere- this is a small restaurant which got very loud at times
Overall, if you love seafood, don't miss out on this place! This is #2 on my top ten list of best of all time seafood restaurants!
Excellent food, service and atmosphere
I had the seafood combo and it was absolutely delicious
The clams were delightful
The hostess is a sweetheart
Highly recommended!
My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience here
The service was great
We were promptly seated for our 7:30 reservation
And it's a good thing we made a reservation because the place was packed by 8pm
The waiter was nice, always checking up on us, and gave us samplers to try
The food was excellent
I usually don't eat seafood, but the fish was fresh and delicious
We had the sesame shrimp, the St
Peter's Fillet, and the salmon fillet
The chocolate souffle dessert was tasty too!
You must try this restaurant
You will not be dissappointed
I called ahead to make a res for my girlfriend and I for after I proposed to her
The hostess was so accomodating and did everything in her power to make the dinner special
The owner sat with us and asked us what fish we liked and prepared an entree for each of us with an array of seafood
The service was incredible and the meal was absolutely delicious
The seafood was extremely fresh and the salads, apps dessert were equally satisfying
Now I realize we got a little special attention due to the occasion, but the owner and staff were equally attentive to all the other tables
You can hear and see how content the other patrons were with their meal
This is an all-around great restaurant
I am a true fish and seafood lover and often have a hard time finding that perfect fresh piece of fish
until I found Turquoise Seafood Restaurant that is
I had a whole grilled bronzini while my boyfriend ate a whole red sea bass and both fish were unbelievably fresh and cooked to perfection!! We also enjoyed the most refreshing israeli salad that we have ever had
The whole experience was amazing because not only did we absolutely love the food but the restaurant itself is just beautiful
The turquoise ventian plastered walls and the rocks that surround the bar make you feel like you are close to or on the beach
Even the faux ostrich chairs are beautiful!! And to top it off we had the most amazing tiramsu dessert
Every part of our meal was a ten! This is a restaurant that every fish lover must try!
Fantastic whole fish
An experience to be experienced more often than not
Friendly informative service, combined with extraordinary fish, provide a worthwhile and memorable dinner
I feel privileged to live so close to this fine establishment
After many trips to downtown and midtown for seafood, my boyfriend and I were thrilled to hear about a new place opening up here on the UES; unfortunately, the experience did not live up to expectations
The wine we ordered was unavailable, the appetizer (zucchini medallions) was bland, the tuna was not fresh, and the dorad was below average
Overall, the mediocre food is not worth the price (over $100 for 2), and the atmosphere does not help the situation
We have had much better UES seafood and more at the York Grill and other spots
My girlfriends and I found this gem in the UES
The place had just opened and the place was busy
The food prices seemed a tad high but in the end it was all well worth the price
Their wine list was more reasonable in pricing as we truGreat Gamaly enjoyed the Gamay our server suggested (this after finishing a bottle of Simi Chardonnay first)
Sam the owner is fabulous and everyone there is suoerduoer friendly
We'll definitly will return
Great Fish, Great Ambiance A great Isreali Wine List
I would Suggest the St Peters Fish Red
They just recently opened, but they seem to have it all figured out in terms of food quality, the dcor and their service
Youre started out with a little taste of it all - Middle Eastern salad combo (definitely order the refreshing Israeli salad) and from there you have a rich variety of Seafood options, all of which go highly recommended
If you wish to discuss the owners are there for you
The service is home-made the owners go out of their way to make sure you order the best they've got and that you're satisfied
Move over, because they will join you at your table, after all you are in their Turquoise house
You will find that going a little bit out of your way for good BBQ couldn't come any better than Smokey's in LIC
The ribs are perfect
moist and fall right off the bone with just a hint of sauce and the pulled pork melts in your mouth, cooked to perfection
Make sure to get the cornbread, whose presentation as 2 giant slices will suprise you, then when you taste it
heaven
To end the meal, get a Mojito
Seriously
After you finish what is a fairly heavy meal, the Mojito will be just light enough for you to finish your meal off correctly
If that's not your thing, go for the Blue Moon draft
As I stated earlier, going one stop out of Manhattan will definitely be worth this meal, and you will pleasantly suprised to find out that LIC is, in the near future, going to surpass DUMBO as being the in place to live
I was about to go into this long thing about where else you can find meat that melts in your mouth, while you can feast your eyes on the meat AROUND you except AT Smokey's, but never mind

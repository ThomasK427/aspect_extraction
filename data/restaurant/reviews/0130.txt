The portobello mushroom roll app
was fantastic and huge and the rock shrimp app
had a ton of flavor
The avocado leaf tuna entree was great (a lot of heat, the way I like it) as well as the pulled pork special
Good cheap wine list and awesome raspberry margaritas! Honestly just as good as Mesa Grill for about half the cost
the appetizers were tasty and creative, though a tad small
the main courses were incredible
the desserts even better
even the pre-appetizer dip was delicious! i will definitely go back
the prices were also very reasonable
a great value! much better than many higher priced restaurants in the city
We went to Hell's Kitchen a while back for pre-theather dinner for 6
It's a small place with an intimite appearance and trendy ambience
But, it is a little loud for group conversation
Their dishes were more fusion than most Pan-Asian places with a variety of influences and were very innovative with nice presentation
Prices were moderate, and I would definitely go back
We didn't need reservations, but I would probably recommend it on weekends after 6:30
My college roomate and I stopped in to have a pre-theater dinner at Hell's Kitchen and we were not disappointed
The food was delicious and creative and the prices were very reasonable! I would highly recommend this great place!
Great food- nice Mexican/southwestern influences on traditional American cuisine
It's loud and a bit packed, but the food makes up for it
Not recommended for a date, but a good place to go with a friend or two
This is one of my favorite places to eat in the city
The food is terrific! It offers the perfect combination of sweet and spicy
My favorite? The grilled shrimp and guacamole on plantains with jalapeno puree and deliciously sauteed veggies with tortilla strips
IT'S AMAZING!! Their fresh fish dishes make you moan
And the free cornbread/bean dip appetizer rocks
There's a reason this place is always packed
Although small, croweded and loud, the food is so amazing that I didn't mind the ambience
Try the duck empanadas for appetizers- they come with a fig mole sauce
Amazing
Small and cozy, but can be hard to get a table around theatre dinner times but it is worth a wait
Try the seared tuna appetizer with gauc on chips-excellent!
After requesting to be seated at an empty table, the waitress (who was so terribly burdened when we asked to move from the bar to the table to have dinner) asked us to get up from our seats and wait for a smaller table because a party of 3 just walked in
and the table was for 4
How exceptionally rude!! I have never been seated and then asked to get up and wait because a larger group came in!! There are so many restaurants in the city
no need to tolerate that treatment!
Outstanding, fantasic food!!! What a talented young chef
I highly recommend it
The shrimp appetizer was wonderful, great avacado salsa, great everything
I had the special quesadilla -- artichoke and fontina or something, and it was pretty awful
But everything else, from appetizer to dessert, was great
Yes, the reservations policy is weird, and yes, we had to wait 30 minutes past our time to get a table even when half the restaurant was empty, but who cares when the watermelon margaritas are that great?
A friend and I made reservations for 6:15 this past Saturday, and although she was running a bit late, I was seated at the table while I was waiting
The food was excellent
The opening shrimp cake was very tasty and full of flavors
My friend's chicken quesedilla puts others to shame, and my pork loin was quite good
The service was excellent, as was the maitre'de, which I was surprised about considering the other reviews
Overall a great restaurant
Despite the reviews that the staff was bitchy, we still went
The four of us had a super friday night dinner
The place was packed, and we secured a 7pm reservation (no reservations past 7pm)
The margaritas are amazing, best I've had in the city
If only it were closer to the East Village! We shared the shrimp, crab and duck appetizers
All fantastic
We had the steak, the halibut and the lamb for dinner - equally incredible
The portions are all very well sized
We couldn't make to dessert
Entrees were $14-20, apps all under $10
I highly recommend it
We are going back
I find it a real bitch to find a great place in the theater district that's got super-great food
This was really refreshing and fun and I plna on goign back for sure
I only wish it were bifger and not so hard ot get a res! The food has to be great and I'll forgive them everythign else, but everything else was really good to - the waiters were helpful adn not annoyingly firnedly, i like the decor
definately a switch from the bad meals at ridiculous prices you usually get around there
Haven't eaten here in awhile - went for Memorial weekend - sat at the bar because I was dining by myself - felt comfortable doing so
Had the special tamale and the lamb with blueberry compote - both very good
It wasn't a scene mainly because it was late and holiday weekend
Other times I have been - it has been too full of pretenious silly loud people - which makes dining, either alone or with friends, not pleasent
In a city of many mexican-themed restos here's one standout
Surprisingly good from appetizers to entrees (and usually entrees diappoint me)
Don't eat too much of the cornbread/bead dip since it only gets better from there
Biggest issue: noisy
Sue Torres is an excellent, inventive chef
Her restaurant is so unpleasant, however, that I can't recommend it
1
The reservation policy is confounding
Long waits, and then the staff rushes you
2
The staff is unfriendly and unprofessional
Yesterday we weren't greeted at the door
After finding the hostess, she held up her figure to tell us to wait while she laughingly finished her story to her friend
3
The room is too dark, too loud, and too cold
The AC blasted down on our table and the tables to either side of us all night
We requested that it be turned down five times
Nothing was done
We ate with our coats zipped up
Furthermore, if the room is already loud, why would you add piped in music to the din? It was such a relief to get out of there, who cares if the food is good?
The Scene The small, below ground dining room has the feeling of an exclusive, well-bred supper club
Framed by backlit banquettes and warmly illuminated brick walls, and with a cozy bar at the entrance, the design is refreshingly notable for advancing absolutely no architectural metaphors--it's just a nice place to eat
The staff, while professional, can be humorless and rote
The Food You certainly won't need to be carried to a cab from overeating here
In the feathery, well-conceived dishes of chef-owner Dan Barber, flavored broths supplant virtually all sauces
For instance, a beefy charred hanger steak rests on a mound of romaine lettuce in a mild horseradish broth; perfectly poached salmon is elevated by an orange-scented shellfish broth, and crab meat lasagna, while texturally uninteresting, nicely counters the sweet shellfish with a mustard sauce
For starters, try the walnut-based eggplant and zucchini
Just made my second visit to Blue Hill and it was simply amazing
Chef Dan Barber and his staff are master's of taking high quality ingredients and maximizing their potential without overcomplicating the food with smoke and mirrors
The portions are not huge, but the $68 tasting menu is quite a bit of food
On my last visit I ordered the tasting menu and added on a course (that made it $83)

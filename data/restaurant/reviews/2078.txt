great food, great service, the waiters even tied our lobster bibs on for us
we went around 9 on a saturday night and there was no wait
I was here last night with five friends and the service was all over the place
They stuck us in the back in this sort of crevice where getting the attention of the staff was nearly impossible
At some point the manager attached his personal attention to our table, but that didn't fix the situation
The appetizers (we ordered 5 or 6) came out out over a 10 minute time span
I had to ask 4 times (4 times!) for a coke before it was delivered
I was eating with a bunch of off-duty restauranteurs, so they left a big tip, nonetheless, but it was much more than the restaurant deserved
My advice: sit up ront where you'll be noticed!
The 16 oz
steak or lobster special prix-fixe kicks butt! Only twelve bucks AND the waiters are total professionals
For side dishes, get the garlic-y green beans AND their lightly fried sliced potatoes (my hubby's favorite)
I had a big family birthday dinner here, and I bring out-of-towners here for Maine lobsters authentic neighborhood dining
The best lobster, sangria, Cosmo, calamari, seafood stuffed mushrooms
you name it, are tucked away in Greenwich Village at an affordable price
Cafe' Espanol's three locations offer the real deal for a great deal
I prefer Carmine Street because there's usually a seat and my favorite waiters are there
While we're at it, how about a lobster dinner for $11
95? The way they broil it with garlic and breadcrumbs is worthy of an encore
How do I know? Every one I've brought by has become a regular!
good food, in a nice spot on a beautiful block in the west village
the eggplant lasagna appetizer is great, and their pasta dishes are too
the prices are very reasonable, and although there can be a wait, its worth it
Casual and cute atmosphere
Make sure you're up for dining next to strangers because the tables are pretty tight
Food was great, service was okay
A very inviting space, but so-so/average food and amazingly inept service when we were last there
We ordered wine with our dinner - yet it didn't arrive before our meal
Our waiter disappeared and we asked other waitstaff and busboys for drinks to no avail
It was actually pretty funny
They later told us that our waiter had to fix the 'computer' - that was the reason he couldn't bring us our drinks
I don't know
screw the computer - serve us the 300% mark-up wine first
I went on 5-21-04, we couldn't find parking for awhile, but that's a given when eatting in NYC
The restaurant is romantic, but congested! Its hard to hear what your date has to say at times
The food was okay, I rather travel to Little Italy and get a better deal
Did I mention there is no signin sheet? We had to wait by the door, and the host failed to acknowledge our existence for a whole 15 minutes! If you plan on going on a rainy day, bring your umbrella! We ordered Brushetta, a 6 on a scale of 10, I like cold tomatoes on toasted bread, they had warm tomatoes
We had penne vodka, which was a 6, too creamy; riccotta cheese filled ravioli with marinara sauce was a 7
The totalw/ tip was $40
Pricey for the small quantities, especially vegetarians!
Have these people never heard of seasoning?! The setting is very cozy and intimate with soft candlight and a corner location that looks out onto the quiet street, perfect for a date
Unfortunately the food was not up to snuff
My salmon, which was purported to be herb-encrusted, was nearly flavorless
My date's lamb chops, although beautifully presented, were also direly lacking in taste
He had to use a liberal amount of pepper to awaken his entree
For the money, there is better out there
The secret is out, La Focaccia is now serving Brunch on the weekends!! No need to wait in long lines at surrounding establishments; La focaccia has always seated me immediately
They even offer complimentary homemade muffins and breads, adding a special touch
Here is another secret, last week they temporarily renovated the restaurant to shoot a scene for the movie Mona Lisa Smiles
Everything about La Focaccia is wonderful - the size, the service, the lighting
I keep wanting to go back there because I know I'll have a great time
Truly a resturant you need to try
Great little village spot
Good food, service is very good, I have occasionally been served by the owner
Very nice ambience, its romantic without being drippingly romantic
great date spot
We've eaten here 4 times since February of '06 and it has always been a positive experience
We've brought 2 other couples and they've also enjoyed the experience
I planned an event was ready to send out my invites, when a partner told me his partner booked another event didn't put it in the book
It took him 5 days to either check or let me know; unfortunately, my invites were already purchased
Instead of giving me a real apology, he brushed it off saying sorry sweetie hanging up on me
I will not be recommending this place
It is also worth knowing that when I originally inquired, the partner told me the family portion serves 4; by the time I went there in person to check it out, 4 turned into 2 or 3 per the lead waiter/bartender who was discussing the $30 pre-fixe option with me, alongside the partner
Since I wasn't electing the pre-fixe or family style option anyways, it didn't impact me or my decision then
Now, I'll never eat there
Hi,  I am usually very picky for places to eat
I loved Torino
Nothing pretencious but just a really friendly, laid back atmosphere with solid Italian food at VERY affordable prices
i will definately go back there soon!  Chris
We all know there is no shortage of Italian spots in this town
Cafe Torino is a standout place
The food, service, ambience, and wine list (try the Italian Shiraz!) are top notch
The pasta is homemade on site and to die for
Huge portions for very reasonable prices-without compromising the quality
The outdoor garden is charming, romantic and fun
An easy, no stress place to visit
Go check it out!
You can't stop thinking about if for days to come
I went to Caffe Torino with a group of friends yesterday and loved it!!! The food was delicious and I loved the atmosphere
The waiters are super friendly but none of that overdone Hiiiiiii is everything oookaaaaaaaaaaaaay stuff
Allen, I guess he is the owner, has a great sense of humor and makes you feel really welcome in his place
I am definitely going back whether with a group of friends or just on a romantic date
but you can still experience Torino in the Village
The new owners of Caffe Torino have recast a West Village favorite as an elegant, yet cozy Italian trattoria that welcomes regulars and newcomers
The new changes - from the redesigned interior to the new additions to the wine list [Valpolicella Ripasso] and menu [spaghettini carbonara, cheese clock and chocolate souffle] - are an Italiophile's dream
Torino's famous tiramisu is still the best I've eaten in the city, and trust me, I've tried the lot! The long-overdue renovation of the basement has created an ideal party space for large or small groups
The new Sunday brunch is also great - a nice change from the tired 8th Ave brunches in Chelsea
caffe torino has now new ownership and has a new charrming and very italian look the food has the same good quality and consistency but the new owners improved it with new dishes and fine new wines
the restaurant changed alot and I suggest to go see the pic on the website to have an idea
A beautiful lounge area welcomed me and made me feel comfortable right away
as usual home made bread, pasta and desserts make the difference
A must in the west village
What happened to the old Caffe Torino? It used to be amazing! There used to be great menu choice, stellar service and it was worth every penny
Now it has gone downhill
The garden dining could be such a great experience and has been
Now, you can easily be ignore and the food is subpar
It's not dining experience that it could be and certainly isn't the experience it used to be
Owner and bartender were so nice, wine list was delicious (and educational), and the food is tasty
Overall - great place to spend a few thoroughly enjoyable hours
Great place to go with friends! The food is delicious, it's always to share, and the prices unbeatable

It continually measures up
The service is good and friendly and the price is right
We've been going for years
I recommend it highly, it's a great neighborhood place
Fantastic food, great value
Lots of comfort food prepared exactly as you wish it would be! It's the best Italian place I've tried so far in all of New York
We got the cold appetizer sampler and the dish was FULL of food, all for $12
For entrees, I got Veal Piccata and my girlfriend got Eggplant Parmejan - both were delicious to the extreme! We would definitely come here again!
The food was great and the service was even better
Manhattan atmosphere at a Brooklyn location
I have to admit I have not been to Aunt Suzie's in a while-but I used to live down the street and came here often
The food is delicious-don't believe the bad reviews-trust me-I have eaten hear at least 15 times and never had a bad meal
The ambience is warm and cozy
The canoli is to die for! They fill it fresh after you order! Don't miss it! I look forward to a visit-hopefully in the near future!
The homey decor and loads of people are inviting enough, but dont come here expecting to be bowled over by the food
Unispired at best, the food at Aunt Suzies is too bland to make a lasting impression
If your looking for good food, great prices and good service, then you must go to Aunt Susie's
Its cozy and intimate
They don't take reservations so expect a wait at prime times
Aunt Suzie's is a great restaurant
Don't listen to the bozos who compare it to the Olive Garden
Or maybe you should, because then there won't be as long of a waiting list next time I go there for dinner
The nay sayers obviously have not tried the rice pudding or the eggplant parm
I loev Aunt Suzie's, and I'm eating there tonight
I can understand why this restaurant has garnered so many vociferously negative reviews
This restaurant has no place on a New York's Top Ten list of Italian restaurants
However, Aunt Suzie's is not as bad as it's detractors claim
It is basically a neighborhood joint, with food that varies between quite good to pretty mediocre
I live 2 blocks from Aunt Suzie's so I occassionally get takeout or take friends there
However, if I did not live in such close proximity I would make no effort to eat there
If you are looking for great southern Italian food in Brooklyn, try Queen in Brooklyn Heights (though it is expensive) or countless other cheaper places in South Brooklyn or Bensonhurst
Aunt Suzie's is nothing more than your neighborhood version of the Olive Garden
The food is not all that appetizing--there are so many other great Italian restaurants in this city! And I'm sorry, but I feel like I'm dining in the country store rather than an Italian restaurant
Except for one instance with bad mussels, the food here has been reliabley good
I like the sauce, the eggplant is great, and the seafood marinara is (nearly always) fantastic
It's close to home, and not too pricey
(When I want outrageous Italian, I head to Besonhurst
)
Great food for the money, and
it is a little bit different than most italian restaurants
i had a good experience here, though it was a little pricier than need be
the anchoive salad was just a glorified ceasar salad, but the escarole appetizer was fabulous
i had the cheese tortellini with meat sauce and it was pretty good, nothing amazing
but the atmosphere is relaxing, good place for kids
I lived around the corner from this restaurant for four years and never could understand why people actually chose to eat there
The food is really unimaginative and the ingredients are cheap
The service is equally poor
Most dishes any self-respecting bachelor could easily make for himself at home (e
g
spaghetti sauce from a jar over macaroni)
Oh, and don't forget all of the noise from children! Don't go!
Nothing special at all! Your average Italian Restaurant
There are many better ones in the neighborhood
Wouldn't go there again
A few people have noted that Aunt Suzie's has poor service and unresponsive management
Well, folks it starts right at the top
The owner was a misery to my group over ten years ago and I haven't been back since
OK, maybe I am holding a grudge
But if the owner is nasty, why should I give her my business? The food sure ain't worth leaving home for
If you want Italian food in Brooklyn, go to Bensonhurst or Bayridge
Its superior by far (hint: try Areo's, Il Colosseo and LB Pizza
Some of the best foods at Aunt Suzie's are the traditional comfort dishes
Chicken Parm, Lasagna, Ravioli
It's a treat every time and the servers are polite, warm, and efficient!
I head down the street to Aunt Suzie's for some ravioli or lasagna
Something my grandma would make
I have dined there alone a few times and once had great service and once was ignored
Other wise all my experiences with this place have been great
I love the little tomato, oil bread snack they give you to start
If you are looking for straight up classic italian this is a great option for you
bring your friends and the kids too
Boy, this place never disappoints
We always leave with a doggie bag
Great prices and great food
What's not to love
The food is great, the prices are inexpensive and the service is good
This is my favorite neighborhood restaurant anywhere
You can eat her twice compared to most other places
This food is what I mean when I say Italian
red
Tomato sauce to write home about
No pretentions about the food or anything else
It's actually better than mine, so why spend all those hours in the kitcken
Both me and my partner feel very at home here and the price is right
This place cooks like Iowa, Bland uninspired you can easily make this stuff better at home
Any decent jar sauce is better than this
So ask yoursek, why eat at this place? What's it's purpose? This is not Brooklyn authentic, its Park Slope dribble!!
This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city
I've taken visitors from out of town here repeatedly
Off the beaten track--well, it was until recently, Aunt Suzie's has good sized portions of delicious food served at reasonable prices
Warm in ambience and equally suitable to families as it is to romantic couples, this little restaurant is one of Park Slope's culinary treasures
Aunt Suzie's is a safe bet in the best sense of the term--you can usually get a table (no longer a given on Brooklyn's bustling Fifth Avenue strip), the food's sure to be plentiful and tasty, and most palates will be pleased and gratified, if not stunned and amazed
A longtime area favorite, Aunt Suzie's has managed to hold its own against more chi-chi newcomers, and it's not just the low prices -- the comfortable family vibe and bonhomie go a long way to explain its appeal, too
They have amazing food! It's served shortly after ordering, which is great because you'll starve smelling other's food
If it's a busy night, they bring it even quicker, and they don't really rush you! They'll keep the salsa and chips bowl filled (so don't snack beforehand!)
I recommend the fajitas, sizzling, hot and tantalizing! Amazing place!!! Try the margaritas, sans salt!
Fresh, pure, colorful - a dream
Friendly wait staff
Excellent variety for vegetarians, like myself
I was actually excited to have Mexican food in Park slope and decided to go to Elora's after reading citysearch reviews

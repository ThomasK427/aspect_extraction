Try the seared Tuna it was so fresh I was debating whether or not to get another
The wine is some of the most affordable in the city and doesn't sacrifice quality and they actually had a DJ who played a very ecclectic mix
I love this Hell's Kitchen staple
Eatery is my favorite place for lunch
The staff is very friendly and seem to be having a lot of fun at work
The eclectic waitstaff creates as much of the atmosphere as the fun wall sconces and the funky green seating
But really why do we go out to eat - food! and Eatery's is delicious
Great salmon club, enormous burgers, and yummy salads
Also, as about their daily specials that can be really great
But no trip to Eatery is complete without sweet potato fries!!
I usually don't go on blind dates, but my friends kept insisting they had this guy that was perfect for me, so I agreed to meet him
He picked Eatery, a joint I had heard of but never visited as I live in Brooklyn and rarely make it past 14th street
The experience was totally worth the trip
The restaurant was on a short wait so the maitre'd pointed us to the bar where I enjoyed homemade red sangria and my date grabbed a hitachino, which the bartender informed us is a white Japanese ale
We were seated promptly and greeted quickly by our friendly and cute server
The chill but professional atmosphere of the restaurant made both my date and I very comfortable, so conversation flowed easily as we went from delicious mussels in a amazing curry broth, to light salads perfect for the hot weather
The night ended perfectly with a to-die-for warm chocolate cake and a good night kiss from my date! I will certainly be making more trips to Hell's Kitchen
to visit both Eatery and my new boyfriend! :)
Some friends and I recently stopped by Eatery planning to get drinks and a bite, but loved the space and the vibe and ended up having dinner at the bar
First, I must say that their mojitos were delicious and muddled to perfection! The bartender was fantastic and suggested some terrific dishes
We sampled the tequila shrimp over flautas (amazing!); the very flavorful duck tostada; and a special with balsamic glazed flank steak and an inventive, refreshing salad
For dessert we had to go for the molten chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream, and the oozing hot chocolate was rich enough to inspire some very naughty ideas!  The crowd was a little bit of everything - boys, girls, straight, gay, very attractive (not to mention the staff - a little built in eye candy never hurts!) If you like pretty things and good food, this is the place to go
Having lived in HK area for 4 years, I have seen restaurants come and go
This one has lasted! Other restaurants have tried to copy Eaterys' formula of decor, service and food, but no one can beat the Big Purple E
The Mac Jack and the Asian Chicken salad are of course staples but their daily menu additions is one of many the reasons I keep returning
There is always something new to try and is always delicious! Speciality drinks from the E-bar are fun and hit the spot! Rumor has it that they are expanding
Can't wait to see what they come up with next! Hail to the Big Purple E
I hadn't been to Eatery in quite some time, but decided to try it again with some friends
We got seated promptly, the waiter suggested cran-apple martinis,(so yummy) We ordered some apps; ginger calamari, with an amazing dipping sauce, and black mussels in a curry broth, so tasty, but the best part were the entrees
We ordered this amazing tuna dish that was served with a warm noodle salad (so so good
), we also had the best salmon dish ( I'm not even a fan of salmon but there was this amazing mustard sauce)
Of course no meal would be complete without an order of the Asian chicken salad, I have had it dozens of times and it's always fantastic
I love coming here, the food is always great, the servers are fun and attentive, and the music is a combination of 80's nostalgia meets the Buddha Bar series
I've just got to say that I love this place From the Mac Jack to the Warm Chocolate Cake
They just do it right
The atmosphere is very upbeat and energetic
And the great cheerful, friendly staff are always they there to fill any need I may have
It's the perfect place to go and have a great meal
And if the Cranapple Martini does not satisfy your sweet tooth their is always plenty of Eye Candy that will
I love the Eatery
I go there often just to make my way though their fabulous menu
The food is awesome and creative
I know I'll have a great meal, but I also know I'll have a great time
The waiters are fun and sassy and know their way around that fantastic menu
I followed my handsome waiter's suggestions for everything from my cranapple martini, BBQ duck tostada appetizer and rum-glazed pork tenerloin entree to the scandalously good brownie sundae
The entire experience was highlighted by my waiter's good-time spirit and great taste!
Life was getting me down
My boyfriend cheated and my dog ran away
My friends decided to rally the troops for a night out
They dragged me from my couch straight to Hell's Kitchen for a little pre-party at Eatery
As I peered around the frosted glass into the E-bar I knew things were looking up
Maybe there was magic in my mango mojito, but life was looking up After a perfectly timed wait that left us three cocktails deep, we were escorted to a corner banquette perfect for us six sexy sirens
We gushed over an order of ginger calamari
Feeling like I deserved a little pampering I indulged in the chipotle spiked meatloaf that made me so comfy I wondered how I was ever sad in the first place
My biggest dilemma in life was now who to flirt with next, the bartender, the waiter or the dj?
i've only been in the city for about 8 months but have dined in many restaraunts all over the city since i've been here
eatery, however, has been the restaurant where i have consistantly felt at ease about being in such a big city
the restaurant is trendy and exciting, yet comfortable
the staff is always making sure that we are enjoying ourselves and our meals
everything from the music to the decore to the comfort food makes me feel as if i've been in nyc my whole life!! some of my favorite dishes are the mustard-crusted salmon, mac and jack, pork tostada, edamame soup, and the baby spinich salad
all highly recomended!!
I live in the neighborhood and love Eatery -- it's my regular funky haunt
Took some friends there last Wednesday and they had a DJ which made it really fun
Food is always delicious -- gotta get the duck tostada! I also love their tequlia shrimp dish -- the menu is really creative and diverse -- my picky friends even found stuff they loved
We got there early so there wasn't much of a wait -- otherwise, I usually sit at the bar and have a cocktail
They have a watermelon martini with fresh juice that rocks my world!!!! Service has always been fast and friendly -- even when I go for brunch -- which is a rare thing in this neighborhood! And they're open late -- which is an after theater plus!
This place is so over-rated
The food does not live up to the hype- I have had better Diner food at half the price! Bad brunch- I don't understand how this joint ever got a good write-up
My stuffed french toast was something only a 10 year old wolud like- mushy, way too sweet, and swimming in chocolate sauce
My date had the Burger- it tasted like over done sawdust and the french fries were soggy and limp
Eatery is getting scratched off our list
Bad Food Tragically Hip
I had the e-benne (their version of Eggs Benedict) and my friend had the Cheddar Bacon Omelet
At least the e-benne was totally flavorless, and that was a real benefit compared to the omelet
The hollandaise sauce was runny and the eggs sat atop a pile of cardboard-like hash browns
The omelet, on the other hand, was just plain awful! The eggs were rubbery, the cheese clumpy and sour
The omelet tasted like an old balloon
My friend sent it back and ordered 2 eggs over-easy with a side of bacon
Big mistake! The bacon was a heap of limp strips- greasy and so not-cooked
The toast was cold and flimsy
I cant even find the words to describe the home fries
The eatery has only two things going for it; location and no competition
Be warned
Be very warned
I finally found my place to hang in Hells Kitchen! Just when I thought that I was about to give up hope on finding a place to meet with my friends before we go out for the night, I came across the Eatery restaurant
My favorite things about this place is that its not painfully filled with posers, the food is awesome, and the staff is so informative and friendly
My first time there I had the tuna entre which was seared perfectly
It was just right for a summer night
Not too mention the 2 Ruby Slipper martinis I had along with it! The new Absolut ruby red is too good its scary!!! I actually came back that weekend for brunch
Even though it was busy, I still felt welcomed and loved my Fellini along with my crab cake benedict
Its great to know that some places still appreciate their customers
People just want to go out and have excellent food, get friendly service, have a fun time and still be able to afford the other things that the city has to offer
The Eatery gets it and thats why we will definitely be back!
My friends and I have dined at several places in New York on our weekly get together
We found that our experience at the Eatery very inviting
I had the duck tostada and the tuna entree and loved both of them
My friends really enjoyed their spinach salad with portabello and the tequilla shrimp
Our favorite was the special pistachio crusted shrimp and scallop dish
Our waitress Laila was refreshing
She made us comfortable and kept us laughing

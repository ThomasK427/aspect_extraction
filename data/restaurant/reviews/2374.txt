Desserts, like the drunken donuts, combine whimsy with delicacy
My husband used to work in Manhattan and ate here weekly
Now when we visit NYC, we make a point to dine here first
Yes, it's pricey, but the filet was so good we think about it for a week afterward; and the fish stew (like buillabasse) is the best I've ever eaten! In fact, I ordered it as the meal and it was perfect
We love the crispy sesame flat bread
No problem splitting the house salad, which has an excellent house dressing
The wine selection is satisfactory
I guess what brings us back every time, though, is the service
We find the waitors very attentive, friendly and helpful
The atmosphere is pleasant, not dim or loud, and romantic
We feel our dining money is well spent here! Highly recommended
This one of the best places in NYC to eat at the bar
The old-school professional Irish bartenders give the best service in town
They have had the same staff for years and do not have the high turn over of staff like many NYC establishments
The food is great, look for the white cheese pizza often on the special board
As far as steakhouses go, there are finer outlets in the area
That said, Maloney Porcelli did things a little differently in terms of presentation (the porterhouse came with several interesting garnishes on the plate) and the use of homemade steaksauce, but, on the whole, there is no reason to go here over any of the other steakhouses in the area
I've been to this restaurant twice, once for dinner and once for Sunday brunch
The food was very good
I had the filet for dinner and a filet and poached egg sandwich for brunch
Both times they got my steak right
The service was courteous and the place very clean and attractive
The appetizers and soups are huge
Be careful when ordering soup before a steak
You may not be able to finish it all
The Sunday brunch is very reasonably priced
Possibly the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant of this caliber
Wrong drinks arrived, mixed-up drink orders, wrong cutlery removed, wrong dinners served, no dessert service
Coffee lukewarm at best
I have had better service at a corner diner and it didnt cost me $300
00 plus
Mind you the restaurant was almost completely vacant on a Saturday night at 8:00 PM! And we were seated upstairs in an empty restaurant
The food was alright for what it was, and I'd like to have the pork shank again, but not at this locale
Perfect after work for drinks then dinner
Great bartenders! The staff is very accomodating and the food is amazing! Try the Crackling Pork Shank if you are STARVING!
Almost a week later and my friends and I are still talking about it,we had such a great time!All the staff really go above beyond ,the service was outstanding yet relaxed fun
Great bar scene,incredibly good food lots to choose from!Can't wait to go again!!
this is great place to go on expense acct
if you have to pay yourself, there are other better places
the food was good - med
rare steaks, appetizers, sides all good
nice interior, noisy tho
svc
just ok
The SUM IT: save your money go elsewhere unless you're on expense acct
I was taken here as a surprise for valentines day and it exceeded my expectations
I had one of the best lobsters in NYC
And they even took it all out of the shell for me! The waitstaff was attentive and humorous
Although expensive, well worth it for special occasions!
if you decide you want to try something different, like i did, let me warn you NOT to order the crackling pork shank
unless you are bringing a jackhammer
this is their signature dish, sounds interesting on the menu, served with spicy applesauce
however, you will soon learn that crackling on the outside of the shank is so hard, that you need a tool stronger than a knife
once cracking thru the crackling, i found the pork dry, grislely, and not partcularly flavorful
i also had the lobster springroll appetizer
another bad choice, virtually no lobster, and somewhat rancid tasting
everyone else seemed to like their steak, on the bright side
I had lunch here a few weeks ago with a group of about 7
Everyone was very pleased with the food
Not one complaint
The sides dishes are the best, especially the fries, grilled vegetables and creamy lumpless mashed potatoes
One order serves at least 2 people, maybe 3
And you should also know that the entrees come as is
You must purchase your side dishes separately
Which in my mind is a negative
But nevertheless we enjoyed ourselves and I would definitely go back!
It's all done well here - except the steaks which are best served medium rare
All the trappings of the NY Steakhouse - with an airy atmosphere that you works as well on a date as a night out with the boys
expect a huge glass of bourbon, giant shellfish and a tremendous cut of meat
the most stylish of the top end steakhouses in the city
The wait staff is attentive and innovative
went on a sunday with a group, service sub par, food below avg, i got the signature dish and still can only give it a 5
I have visited this restuarant several times and each time is great
The service was excellent and the food was also excellent
I would definitely recommend it to friends
Guess I went on a good night
But my first time here was awesome
The waitstaff was extremely attentive
Angry lobster, creamed spinach and steaks were great
I'd definitely go again
My family and I went there for a birthday celebration
and the only thing that I found to be the best part was the dessert
I thought there wasn't enough of a selection of entrees, and what they offered was very pricey!  Our waiter was not attentive, and his personality was awful
I would NOT go back there at all
We held a birthday dinner for my friend and were very impressed w/both food and service
7 of us tried 6 main courses and all the dishes were generous and delicious
We all tried the tiramisu for dessert and that was also very tasty
It is a bit on the pricier side, and the ambience is just a homey feel, nothing fancy, but the service was very accomodating (a couple from our party unexpectedly showed up 1 hr late) and the waitstaff made sure we had everything we needed
definitely try this place out!
This restaurant serves up some of the best authentic italian food I have ever tasted! The food and desserts are to die for! I always throw major events with my family (like birthday parties etc
) at Raffaeles
No one can compare
Service there is EXCELLENT
I almost don't want to let anyone else in on my boyfriend and I's little secret
It's not trendy, it's not a single's scene but if you want delicious food in a warm atmosphere, then Rafaele's is your place
My boyfriend has been going for year's and Rafaele makes us feel like family
My father is one of the pickiest eaters and we took him there for his birthday which he raves about to this day
Rafaele and crew NEVER dissapoint
I promise
This little place turns out some of the best -- homemade -- pasta I've eaten in a long time

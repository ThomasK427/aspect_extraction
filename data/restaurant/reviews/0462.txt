Also had the pork belly which was absolutely phenomenal but again
the portion was very small
after dinner went down the block to Bereket to finish off the hunger cravings
Props to the bartender who knew the menu like the back of his hand
I went on a Wednesday witout a reservation
The hostess was firm that there were no tables available (James Beard Foundation was in town), but would happily seat us at the bar
While the portions were on the small side, it was nothing short of incredible
We left feeling satisfied, yet without that disgusting stuffed feeling from places that give you too much food
The bartender was an able server, quite knowledgeable and very entertaining
For a special occasion (given my budget), I would recommend it highly
I can't afford to eat here every week though
It is close to impossible to make a reservation but we managed to snatch a super early spot on a Saturday night
Bad timing: the welcome message was we have 3 sittings we don't want the 2nd sitting to wait for your table
Of course they don't tell you that when you make the reservation! And this is not exactly a cheap place
I guess they'll take your money but make sure you chew your food fast and keep smiling at the condescending waitress
The funny thing was that the 2 tables next to ours were empty the whole time we were there!! (yes, Saturday night)
Otherwise, we really liked the food (be adventurous if you go), cool wine list system (notice the dots) and the sommelier was both helpful funny
It should have stayed closed
Overrated nonsense in an area that may be so-called hip, but desperately needs a street and sidewalk cleaning
Tastes more like WD-40
need to get a few things worked out
phones are always busy
hard to reconfirm your reservations
should think about adding a confirmation number
food rocks, well executed and thought out
although waitstaff needs some help
the table next to us was having a tasting menu (which isnt advertised, and when I asked about it was told they dont do tasting menus) whats up w/ that? I understand if it was a friend of the chef and it was something special, but don't treat customers like idiots
I have been there twice and the food has been really really memorable
Just loose the 'tude guys
Everyone in my party was very disappointed in their meal
The duck appetizer tasted like deli meat
The scallops were ok nothing exciting but too small of a portion
The skate was bland and there was nothing else on the plate to compliment it except for 3 small gnocchies
We left paying $80 bucks per person and we were all starving and had to grab a slice of pizza
The best thing about the place was their cocktails
We love the chef and were bummed that we hated it so much
food was just ok,, to many high end places in such a cool lower east side neighborhood,like prune and apizz, prices to high in these places for this hood
I was excited for this place to open for weeks, but it didn't come close to expectations, and didn't stack up against 71 Clinton Fresh (the way it was two years ago, not now)
The small menu was not very exciting, and the food was very marginal
I would not go crazy trying to get in
Wait a few months for the place to develop
The decor is nice, but not up to places like Blue Water or Fiamma
Why don't they just make the Edamame covered Sea Bass again and be done with it
Wylie Dufresne's WD~50 ranks up there with the best restaurants in NYC
In fact, for my money, there is no restaurant in manhattan where i'd rather dine
The menu is inventive and fresh; the ingredients handpicked by Mr
Dufresne himself
The service is impeccable and the decor, modern yet classic
Make your reservations now, because this place is going to be perpetually packed!
I was one of the lucky who got to dine at WD50 during opening week
Chef Wylie Dufresne does it again
His restaurant is a definite winner
His cooking is sublime and the space is really out of this world! The relaxed and friendly service just makes it a place you'd go to all the time if you can afford it
The Scene Rich brown banquet tables, decorative cream and crimson accents and a mood-conscious soundtrack immediately distinguish M from any number of carbon-copy Chinese restaurants in the city
Gracious owner May Liu elegantly integrates the space's clean, earthy aesthetics with a Williamsburg sensibility, offering the bonus of a hopping downstairs lounge
The Food The vibrant Chinese menu reawakens the palate to the flavorful possibilities of the cuisine
Steamed pork buns, spicy wontons and beef marinate each make sumptuous starters, while black mushrooms and the crave-worthy shredded potato with fresh chili pepper invite sharing
House specials such as shredded pork with bean curd and salmon with a silken tofu satisfy deliciously
The kitchen would do well to offer more desserts--the one option of Eight Treasure Sticky Rice connotes a Chinese fruit cake--but the drinks downstairs encourage one to linger
So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good


the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions
The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though
Unfortunately, the food is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you! Walk-ins are risky too
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood
This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout
May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps
They're terrific!!
What a restaurant! Delicious chinese food, Sauces made at your table
and every sunday night they have a Hip Hop Karaoke Night! What fun!
This is a special place run by really wonderful people who give anyone who walks in the door a warm welcome and sincere interest
My friends and I have been here numerous times and have always been given the utmost courtesy and consideration
It's a great time whether we're eating the wonderful soup dumplings, moo shu chicken, and shumai upstairs or lounging downstairs with specially mixed drinks and hearing truly fantastic live music/excellent DJs
The 80's night rocks!! We love it here!! :)
Great food, great prices great service! M Shanghai never disappoints
Great for takeout as well!
Why do you go out to eat? I go out to eat for good food at a good value, good company, and a fine host
May has all of these covered soundly
I have not been to Shanghai, but I've travelled extensively in China, and May's Shanghai/Northern fusion is delightful and creative
Are there 4 waiters swarming around you to wipe the gob of delicious sauce off of your chin? No
But the kindliness of the staff, with May as the warm queen bee makes this a neighborhood place extraoridinaire
Music, often great
Drinks, excellent and reasonable cost
Consistency? Imperfect
But, if you can run a better restaurant, sign right here some call me Lucifer
I was so disappointed
Frankly, the chinese food here is something I can make better at home
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs
I thought the food isn't cheap at all compared to Chinatown

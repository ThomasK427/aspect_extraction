I thought the environment was more remniscent of a small (friendly) French restaurant than an actual cafe which was nice
Dimly lit and romantic-y
At dinner, I'm a fan of the tagines
Other good options include the falafel and hummus combo plate
I was not such a fun of the steak
Brunch is also really good, esp
the omelets
It's inexpensively priced, but only takes cash
The ambience is pleasant, but it tends to get very crowded
Great brunch place, especially if you like Eggs Benedict or other poached egg renditions, but it does get crowded on the weekends
For dinner, the bastilla--a Moroccan dish with chicken, almonds and other ingredients in filo dough--is quite tasty
In Short The "vegi" burgers (and the full bar) are the main draws: ranging from the Super Veg-Burger with lettuce, tomato and Abijah's secret sauce to the McKate (two "un-beef" patties, special sauce, lettuce, dairy or nondairy cheese, etc
), with a pizza burger, chili cheese burger and a portobello mushroom burger as well
Soups, various fried apps, salads and sandwiches are also served
Come the weekend, locals pack the place for the super-sweet brunch deal
This is one spot I visit frequently
The best veggi burgers in the EV
Friendly staff and quick service
I highly recommend it
The food is banging must add that I don't know how much you can eat, but I've gotten a good fill
Affordable pricing a good spot to small talk before diggin a bak out
Hope they get the blender fixed - the fruit/veg mix was unavailable
Seat yourself, 'cause it's easier finding a seat that way
When I choose to not eat meat, I choose Kate's
The veg reuben, the spinach and walnut salad with warm maple dressing, the enchiladas, etc
etc
And, the best gravy (veg and meat) EVER - EVER is here, which means the mashed potatoes and gravy are to die for! As is the vanilla tofu cheesecake
Now, I dont even love cheesecake in the first place, but this stuff is like crack! And for those who do, my best friend LOVES real cheesecake, and for her birthday we got her this instead cuz she loves it so much
Kate's is the real deal! Good music and beers too
The best vegetarian comfort food
If you are into mom's meat loaf, try it here, you will love it and you will wonder if it really is vegetarian
Then, if you have room, try their vegan cheesecake
It tastes like the real thing and with the raspberry sauce drizzled on top it is scrumptious
The best value in town is their weekend brunch
Lots to choose from, tofu, eggs, pancakes
with a cocktail or juice and coffee for $8
95 (plus tax and tip of course)
I went for brunch on sunday with my friend
The food is always good
and if you are a veggie then that usually outweighs the horrible service
Honestly the wait staff used to be ok
Our waitress took our order and then NEVER came back to our table
We didn't get our drinks until the hostest passed by after 30minutes and i complained
after the people sitting next to us (came after us) were served and left, we still didn't get our food
FINALLY the waitress came with our food after an HOUR! she didn't appologize or give us anything for free
THIS is the first time i didn't TIP
Kate's Joint is comfort food for veggies
Although some entries miss the mark (go to a real Mexican restaurant for nachos) Kate's excells in making home cooked meals that are tofu-fake outs
The best I've had is the fried (un)chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy, simple and delicious
I like ALMOST everything here
I would recommend their sauteed collard greens, the southern cutlet sandwich, karen's burger, their bbq special, and the garlic fries
Their tofu scramble is dry and poorly seasoned and is only enjoyable if eaten with the vegan benedict brunch special which is great
Also their fried vegetable appetizer was soggy and gross both times I've sampled it
Awesome service and great music, even if the waitstaff makes me jealous cuz they have more tattoos than I do
A bonus was the evening when Russel Simmins kept coming inside to hassel a group of young hardcore kids while ranting about veganism
Kate's has wonderful bunch items which I think are fabulous (and I'm not even veggie or vegan!)
The food is great and moderately priced (I love the unsausage)
The service isn't perfect, but the value makes up for it ten fold
Kate's offers a great diner experience, excellent food and very friendly service at reasonable prices
Every item that has a dairy component is offered in a dairy-free version
Go there for a sleepy hangover morning eggs (or tofu) and toast, or a devour a hearty unturkey club for lunch with friends
This place is incredible, even my non-vegetarian friends love it
The atmosphere is hip but unpretentious, you can't miss with the food, and most of the seats are close enough to windows to people watch
I'm not even a vegetarian and I love Kate's
From its retro-diner decor to its sharply-garlicked Caesar salad, Kate's is the eating destination of choice on B
There's a real emphasis here on making food that's tasty as well as veggy: Popcorn shrimp are just one standout example
Plus, the staff's efficient, laid-back and attitude-free
You'd almost think you were in Brooklyn
Highly recommend the country salad and the chocolate cake
The whole grain apple pancakes are heavenly
Great vibe for dinner or just drinks at the bar
A truly phenomenal brunch / breakfast dining experience
You get to see the food being prepared infront of you, you can see how fresh it all is
The OJ is heavenly, the Belgian waffles are better than any Belgian could muster up, and the portions are made for giants
Good food, great Diner Ambience, and the biggest shock comes with the check - its next to nothing ! Great family service and guaranteed to keep every high maintenance date from the night before, extremely happy for brunch
The Scene Tucked away on a quiet block, this small East Village Italian restaurant offers inventive dishes and friendly service in a rustic, warm atmosphere
Tables are packed most weekends, but during the week they're perfect for a date over candlelight
The Food Lavagna ups the ante on ambience and culinary adventure with a modern Italian menu
For appetizers, try the roasted artichoke hearts nestled with cremini mushrooms on a bed of white bean puree
While the pizzas are standard, the pastas are inventive and cooked to perfection
An enticing puttanesca dresses hearty bucatini, and spinach ravioli is bathed in a delicate porcini sauce
Among the entrees are a tenderly roasted rack of lamb and ahi tuna, jazzed up with preserved lemon over eggplant compote
Save room for dessert, especially the mouth-watering banana-bread pudding with a scoop of coconut sorbet
Basically, I took my sister to eat dinner and the minute we both walked in we received diry looks from the owner
Then we looked at the menu not much to choose from and finally they did not great us good bye
So its was the worse experience in my life
A Great Date spot, food is good, service is beyond excellent, it's a perfect cozy little place, large wine selection, I been there several times and am never disappointed by anything!!
The food and the ambience are great, but the service tops everything, the staff welcomes you and makes you feel right at home! I highly recommend it to anyone!
I had dinner at Lavagna the other night with friends and the service has gone down hill
I ordered the same pasta dish as others in my group
My portion was noticeably smaller than others in my group
When I complained to the guy who brought out our food he made a mockery of the situation and failed to take the complaint seriously
I asked him where the owner was and he said that he was the owner and laughed
We complained to our waitress who gave us blank stares
Later in the evening we found out he was not the owner
Later in the evening after our meal we finally found the real owner behind the bar of the restaurant and explained to him the situation which he had been made aware of by the waitress
AVOID THIS PLACE
After waiting an hour with a reservation for our table, we were so appalled by the rudeness of the matre'd, we left
The people sitting at the table we were supposed to have told us they were asked to leave
I could not have been happier since the bathroom air freshener permeated the entire dining room

I got steamed shrimp dumplings in salad and while it was good, i thought the dumplings were a little bland
The menu described these as having wasabi and I was disappointed that they were not hotter
On a positive note, I thought the menu was simple to understand
They did not overwhelm with a ton of choices, my order was ready in 5 minutes if not less, and I got a relatively large meal for 8 bucks
I will try it again but next time, i am going to go with the fried stuff
Okay, it's not the best for dumplings (though not horrible)
HOWEVER, it is ABSOLUTELY the best for two other things on the menu: (1) the chocolate mochi dessert
Fresh mochi entirely covered in roasted black sesame and filled with gooey chocolate
Just barely sweet---it is DIVINE
There's nothing else like it NYC
(2) The Watermelonade
FRESH WATERMELON JUICE!! This is impossible to get anywhere else! These two things are spectacular and more than make up for any shortcomings in the dumpling dept
PS Oddly, vegetarian dumplings seemed more flavorful than shrimp or pork dumplings
This was my second visit and I was throughly disappointed in my shrimp dumplings and miso soup
The shrimp dumplings that were pleasant my first visit tasted very off the second
After a few bites I skipped them and focused on the soup which was mediocre
Edamame was the highlight dusted with a tasty flavored salt
This is a cute place and the concept is great
I think the food needs to be greatly improved though
to the reviewer who said they use the same soups for all dumplings
thats wrong, they actually have 5 different soups
you would know that by simply reading the menu
anyhow i really enjoyed the dumplings especially the peking duck and chicken and thai basil
you should definitely try it with the soups because no other dumpling place in new york has anything nearly as good and with such high quality
These are like gourmet dumplings and cant even be compared to chinatown
Finally tried Rickshaw dumplings after reading about all the hype
its definitely a sanitized version of china town dumplings, but worth a visit
I had the duck dumplings, and the cashier told me to get them fried
They were yummy! My friend got the chicken dumplings, steamed
Could not get enough of the peanut sauce!!! Grabbed a green tea milkshake on the way out, warning drink it quickly because it will seperate, but very delicious
I would go back next time I'm at home depot
dumplings tasted like they were frozen and the soup was bland
asked for more soup - found out they use the same broth for all the dumpling's soups
very disappointed in terms of quality and taste
might fare better in chinatown for real authentic dumplings
I was very impressed with these light as air gyoza style dumplings
The green tea milkshake was yummy
Best of all, though, is the lightning fast service and cheery demeanor of the wonderful staff
Try the Chicken Thai Basil with Peanut Soup (Steamed Dumplings)
It was Fantastic! Can't wait to go back try something else
NO NO NO! This place is awful! The fried dumpings are hard and chewy, and the filling tasted like mystery mush!! Not enough seating, and a limited menu
Peking duck was bleck and the pork chives will only keep coming back to haunt you! Go BACK to chinatown for the real thing!!
Had low expectations compared to my fav dim sum in Chinatown
Was very pleasantly surpised
terrific dumpling options (I had the shrimp in miso soup) and sumptuous drink (green tea milkshake) followed by chocolate soup dumplings for dessert! Skip the trip to Chinatown
enjoy Chelsea instead
Quick service and good prices to boot
Eat well!!!
Among all the unique dumpling fillings I decided to order the chicken and thai basil dumplings with a side of citrus salad
It was more like delicious gourmet dumplings, much tastier than the ones you get in Chinatown, not to mention skipping the trip there
Seating is rather limited so plan to get there early if you want a table
Service is relatively fast during lunch rush
I will definitely go back to try other creative items on their menu
This new dumpling house is great! The quality of the dumplings was good, with a variety of choices and options for either soup and noodles with your order or salad
Try the Peking Duck dumplings or the tofu ones - also the green Asian salad was wonderful
I will be back for another green tea milkshake
Fast and friendly service, and there are some tables to sit down if you choose
Everything was very reasonably priced - you can fill up for less than $10
The Scene A high and mighty air prevails at this dressed-up Lower East Side eatery
The soaring main dining room makes an impression with its high tin ceiling, soft rounded banquettes and small back balcony framed by the restaurant's wine selection
Servers hover one moment and vanish the next
The Food The "fun" factor is high on the menu of experimental, multi-ethnic shared plates
Tender Kobe beef sliders, sweet chunky lobster rolls and mango-studded red snapper tacos look almost too cute to eat
And it'd be easy to become an oyster addict with the restaurant's Rockefeller, breaded, deep-fried and topped with bacon
For less-traditional fare, try the French onion soup dumplings--their liquid soup center bursts in the mouth--but steer clear of the confused beef short rib ravioli
Larger plates like the wasabi-pea salmon satisfy, but lack flair
For a simple finish, the piping hot sugar-coated doughnuts do the trick
The pierogies, pizzetta's, and steak are my favorites
The cocktail list is a little pricey, but everything I've tried has been worth it
Like the menu, the wine list has some really unique items
The food is incredible
I live in the area and have been back four times since my first visit last month
The frittata's at brunch are delicious
Everytime I go, I have a great time
The Stanton Social is a busy NYC restaurant and at times may suffer the usual mishaps, but all around it's got great food, a friendly staff and a great vibe all around
Arrived at 7:30 pm on weekend for a birthday with group intact to have dinner in lounge area
Wasn't nearly full and there was certainly room for my small group of seven, but we were made to wait 1 1/2 hours, even though it was not full
Told that we could choose to sit at one spot but would have to vacate in 45 minutes because the owner's wife or sister was coming and that was HER couch
Snobby and stupid and witchy hostess - completely unneccesary
We were well dressed 30 somethings with a tab well over $600 in the end
The floor manager tried to smooth things over with a bottle of champagne, which was a nice gesture, but late in the game after several guests left because they were starving and I had to personally complain to the manager
Smooth and great food/drinks after it all, but certainly left a bad taste
Plain and simple: the Kobe Beef Sliders are life-changing
I just went last night for dinner and I think I may need to go again tonight
Ordered a couple things at the bar, great service with no attitude and strong drinks
Pink Grapefruit mint martini is awesome
And the donut holes with dipping sauces? Why didn't someone think of that sooner?
the pictures make the place look much bigger than it really is
kobe burgers were really good
french onion soup dumpling were really small
nice atmosphere playing generic loungy music
Stanton Social = Overrated
While the kobe burgers were delicious, the bar was too crowded, the hostess incompetent and the service sterile, at best
Rather than receive bread before our meal, we received a bland bean spread on not-so glorified bagel bites
We didn't have to worry that the line to the only unisex bathroom on the floor was too long (and the bathroom without toilet paper), because the server still hadn't arrived by the time we managed to make it back to our table
In summary, if this restaurant ever deserved high praise, it has since failed to accomodate the influx of New Yorkers seeking the trendiest fare
Bring low expectations for atmosphere and service, and the kobe burger will impress you!
Having read the good reviews, my girlfriend and I were excited about this place
We had an early reservation (7 p

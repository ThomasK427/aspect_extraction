I agree with other reviewers that this restaurant is certainly better than most in the area and it is very reasonably priced
However, why is it so dark in there? Couldn't they add a little extra light?
This place has been quite a find
I've never been overly thrilled with many of the Theater District Italian places
Most of them are overcrowded and suffer from poor service and overpriced food
I found this place a few months ago and have been back since to be sure the first experience wasn't a fluke
The menu is loaded with great Italian dishes
It's hard to choose
The prices are fair and I had a courteous and attentive server during both visits
The ambience is perfect at night, a little dark and cozy feeling
The decor is a mix of traditional and modern
Give this place a try!
I was looking for pre-theatre dining with my 13 year old son
With theatre on 42nd St
, there is not too much to select from besides fast food or chains
We did some searching and found this little gem! Great prices - food was very good
Shrimp were large and tasty and generously portioned
Wait service was attentive
Lots of groups, including some with children
Will definitely try this one again!
This place is slightly off the beaten track just outside of Times Sq
The exterior is nothing fancy, but the interior is attractive and inviting
The waitstaff is great and they accommodate groups well
The food is solidly good with standard Italian dishes as well as some other choices
There were also a few vegetarian options
The portions are just right and I think this is one of the better values per plate in the area
They also have a nice wine list and good dessert
Nothing spectacular but the food is good, tasty and fresh and can be had for a reasonable price
Not the best spot for a romantic dinner, being rather noisy and crowded despite it being a decent size, but a great place to grab a decent meal you will enjoy
A favorite at my office for birthday lunches
This place is nice for a group
The food is a great value and service is friendly
I recommend this place if you live in the area and are looking for a casual dining experience
In Short High ceilings and brick walls make visitors to this dusky, multi-leveled bar and restaurant feel welcome
Beyond the front room is a lounge with a fireplace and a cluster of tables overlooking the bar
A staircase leads to the dining room and, farther up, a skylight-crowned loft space for private parties
The bar draws a mostly after-work clientele
The menu reads like one of those "six-countries-in-five days" package tours
Get on board! The place to see hot bartenders is here
Me and my girlfriends love going therebecause the bartenders are so cute
We even think some of the girls are cute too
They are always having a good time and love to hang out with their customers
Happy Hour is the best time to hang but we've been frequenting Nation now for the soccer
It's packed!!!
Me and my friends always go here
It's great for lunch because the food is simple and good
After work is always a good time
There are nice people working there that make you feel at home
This is my kind of place!
MY CO-WORKERS AND I HAD A GREAT TIME BETWEEN THE MUSIC AND GREAT SERVICE AS I ENJOYED THE BEST BURGER IN MIDTOWN IF NOT MANHATTAN! GREAT PLACE TO MEET NEW AND OLD FRIENDS
The cosmos and the martinis are worth the visit
The staff is always very welcoming and friendly
The Friday night manager has alswys been very accommodating to big parties that we bring in
Thanks
Above it all one would not think there was a such a great restaurant upstairs it serves everything from a real yummy tuna dish to burgers
I also highly reccommend the chopped salad
This is one bar where everyone is there to meet other people, the bartenders hand out full bottles of shots to be poured in the mouths of customers and everyone leaves with a new number
The women in this bar are amazing! Everyone is friendly, having a great time, meeting people
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is upscale but casual
Perfect after work or anytime bar!
Fabulous after work bar to meet people and enjoy the atmosphere
get's crazy later on, people dancing on the bar
I always have a lot of fun here
This bar is busiest after work hours and frequented by investment banker types
There are young guys and old guys here, they're all working guys though
A good place to chill out or meet your investment banker friend at
Don't count on meeting random people though
Some hostesses are ultra nice
Four of us had a delightful dinner at Barrymore's on a Sunday evening
The food was great, prompt seating and a fabulous waiter
When one of us couldn't decide on the cheesecake or key lime pie, our waiter brought both
no charge for one of the desserts!! And they were both delicious!!
This place has some of the worst food I have ever had in my life
Years ago I had fish and chips
The fish was so over fried that there was no more fish left-all grease and breading-YUK!!! You don't come to this place for the food-it's supposed to be a big hangout for theater people-I say whatever! Pretention reigns
The staff and management at Barrymore's are the greatest--very friendly, efficient, attentive and fun
The food is always delicious, atmosphere great and is a very cozy NY hangout
This is basically a saloon, with a cozy no-smoking dining room decorated with memorabilia relating to the Barrymores
The food is reasonably priced standard American fare
The service was excellent in all respects
We arrived at 5:30 and the place was so quiet that we were able to converse without raising our voices
This friendly haven is a real find in the gouge-the-diner, tourist-trap theater district
The Scene Abbondanza is the name of the game here, where a one-price-buys-it-all menu gets you in and out quickly, inexpensively and wishing you hadn't had that second bite of dessert
Almost before you take your seat, you're besieged by an assortment of antipasti that changes according to the season and the whim of the chef
The Food Every dinner includes the all-you-can-eat antipasto and a pasta selection that whizzes around the dining room in well-worn saute pans
Servers pile your plate with papardelle in veal ragu, linguine with black olive paste, penne, rigatoni, gnocchi, ravioli--every night the choice is different
The timid stop there, but if you're still hungry, a small supplemental charge earns you a generous entree
BEWARE! this place charges 18% tip automatically if you have a party of 6 or more, and on top of that, the tip is on top of the tax, meaning they are really getting you for over 20% tip, and their service is not worth it
They may have all you can eat pasta, but you practically have to beg to get a second round of it
If it's all you can eat, when you are done, shouldn't the waiter come around asking if you want more? not this place, they try to take your plates away
We tried to ask for more, and the waiter looked upset, then he called the guy carrying around the pasta to come back, the guy wandered off and we waited about 15 minutes to be served our second round, none of us dare ask for more
With their dessert sampler, they include ice cream and sorbets, but a tiny scoop of each, even if you have 12 people at the table, meaning 12 people will have to dig their spoons into one tiny ice cream flavor, talk about stingy when they charge like $40 for some unlimited pasta and some entrees and dessert
The food tasted good, but the service and price kills it
I go often and recommend Becco's to out of town business associates and friends
Went on a Saturday with out of town tickets and the food was great but the service was awful, even surely
Ordered a $25 glass of wine and it was bad
Told the waiter
A young host came out and said it was good, obviously we were wrong
Left it on our bill until we asked
Was told mistake but it felt like trying to get the tourists!

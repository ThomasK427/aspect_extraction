Try the torta della nonna dessert
The outstanding innovative pastas taste better in the open space garden at baciabbracci
The trip from Manhattan is short and it's worthed
The pizza can be compared only to the one they make in Naples
The servers are well prepared and friendly
Just visited the new neighborhood addition, and it is really fantastic
In terms of pizza, last year's opening of fornino was a lankmark occasion for the neighborhood
Baci takes it a step further, with personal pizzas instead of standard sizes (Small/Large), and a more straightforward menu selection
The ingredients are fresh and tasty, the crust is thin and extremely good, and the inventive combinations make it tough to decide
Overall, highly recommended
The proprietor is also extremely customer-focused and his genuine enthusiasm is the icing on the cake
Grand Street is quickly coming to rival Bedford's restaurant row
In a part of Williamsburg that is long on Authentic Asian and Asian Fusion, Baci and Abbracci is a welcome addition
The food is excellent and stays true to it Italian roots (to the point that some of the dishes can be challenging to the American palate) and the service is attentive, if a bit disorganized at times
My only worry is that Baci and Abbracci's aggresively upmarket approach may lead to a lamentable slide in quality of the food and service as the quantity of dinners goes up
This place is a great addition to the neighborhood! Everything we ordered was delicious
The calamari was tender with a light, flaky breading, the hearty lasagna was velvety and full of flavor, and the wood-fired pizza was incredible!!! The crust was perfectly charred and the tomato sauce, cheese and salami were all so tasty and fresh - just like the Neapolitan pizzas I had in Italy! We topped off our feast with the fluffy, creamy tiramisu
Our waiter was friendly and very attentive which added to the cozy chic atmosphere (they have a cute, spacious garden out back)
Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in NY, but the exceptional food and overall ambience at Baci Abbracci truly stand out
I can't wait to go back!!
This place has it all: delicious food, great ambience and attentive service
And those pizzas are to die for!! Try anyone of the pizzas or experiment with their innovative pasta combinations
Dessert is also a can't miss
Sitting on the outdoor patio is great for brunch or a nice night out
It's perfect for all occasions and an extremely good value!
The fresh pasta dishes mouth-watering pizzas are AMAZING at Baci Abbracci!!! They have a great brunch dinner menu, and the outside patio in the back is a wonderful place to enjoy good food drinks with friends family!!! I definitely will come back try a number of other things on the menu (including dessert!!!)
We have been waiting for the opening of Baci Abbracci
and it was worth the wait! This place is casually elegant, with a wonderful menu and excellent service! I'm looking forward to trying more dishes on the menu
Outside patio is beautiful too!
Stopped by for our dinner reservation on a Thursday night when the weather had topped 90 degrees to discover the restaurant had no A/C (they told us it was broken)
They had huge industrial size fans blowing which did not make for the most pleasant dining experience to say the least
Although staff was pleasant, they seemed overwhelmed and we had to wait for drink refills and food -especially uncomfortable considering the heat
When the food did finally arrive, we were very underwhelmed
Bruschetta was nothing special
Striped bass was flavorless and such a small portion that after appetizer and main course, I was still just as hungry as when we arrived
Prices were unjustified given the small portions
Owners kept moving the fan away from our tables, toward the bar area where his friends were seated without so much as a word to us
All in all, a very disappointing experience
We will not return
Italian TAPAS! That's what they serve
You'll be lucky to get two bites out of each course
The best value on the menu
Dessert
The cheesecake was flavorful and filling
Oh, and since when is a straight up martini served with water? Ice doesn't melt that fast
Drop the arrogance Giorgione and serve some food
Everything on the menu is delicious, the service is impeccable, and the setting is very intimate
The food portions are smaller than normal restaurants, which is perfect because you have room to taste several dishes (think tapas size)
This is a great place to take a date
Although I went on a double date, I recommend Giorgione 508 for you and just one other person
The majority of the seating is along the big counter in the center of the room and it's tight for groups of more than two elsewhere
The lighting is the best you'll find in the city
It's a really beautifully designed restaurant
I thought the service was wonderful and the food was to die for (albeit small portions
)
While wandering the streets of Tribecca two friends and myself crossed paths with an appealing window front, patrons sat inside nibbling bread and sipping wine - it was about 4
30pm
We took a peek in and decided to sit at the long center bar for a bottle of wine
It was fairly empty and the counter waitress was extremely pleasant, knowledgable, helpful and accommodating
Before long it was 8
00pm and we were famished
We ordered a couple of appetizers to share which were excellent and I had the lamb chops main which was perfect (highly recommended)
Portions are on the smaller side
Ambience was comfy, cool and modern but warm
By the time we left (at around 9
30) the place was packed
I am a fan of Giorgione and was happy to hear that they were opening another place around the corner
My girlfriend and I stopped in for drinks and dessert on a Thursday night
The place is very laid-back and gives off the vibe that you are amongst friends
The first reviewer might have interpreted that as poor service, but we find comfort in the feeling that no one is rushing you to order, eat, and leave
The desserts we ordered came out in a timely fashion and it was obvious the ingredients were very fresh
We will be returning again and again
My boyfriend and I frequent the soho/tribeca area for dining and decent spots to have a glass of wine
The first time we stopped into 508, we were the only customers, with at least 5 staff members
We were ignored for 10 minutes sitting at the bar, until finally we over heard the bartender telling another co-worker that the kitchen was closed
The following time we were ignored as well
The last time we sat for 10 minutes without a menu or drinks while the staff members focussed on arguing over their tips
The food is excellent but the service is offensive and I'm almost embarassed for the business itself
There was no manager present and the establishment is put to shame by the surrounding businesses that dont have half the allure that 508 has
When they first opened a month or so ago it was fantastic
As soon as they were written up they stopped caring as much the service and food shows it
Be careful what you wish for
My husband, our friend, and I shared the most delicious dinner I've had in a long time at The Orchard last night
We started with the Robiola cheese flatbread with spinach, pancetta, and cranberries
Robiola is my favorite cheese so I was excited to see it on a menu
We next shared the lobster empanadas (fried pockets stuffed with lobster served with corn on the cob--the corn was wierd and unneccesary) and the crispy rock shrimp salad (super dressing!)
I had salmon ravioli with asparagus in a light lemon creme sauce
My friend had butternut squash agnolletti (pasta pockets) with sage and butter, and my husband had the cavatelli with avocado and pancetta in tomato creme sauce
The raviolis were so delicate, and all of the flavors were fantastic
Portions were perfect (not too small, not too huge)
Service was very helpful and friendly
Ambiance was lovely--lighting was pretty and amber, tables were spaced far enough apart
The only think we didn't enjoy was the dessert; that could use some work
This was my ideal restaurant
Bill for three (3 apps, 3 entrees, 1 dessert, 1 coffee) came to $125 plus tip
Being a BYO saved us a lot of money and made it so we were more willing to spend more on food
I can't wait to go back
I only have good things to say about my meal at The Orchard
The servers were very helpful but left us to relax and enjoy our food
The portion size was very generous for the two appetizers we ordered; one would have been sufficient to share

night dinner wonderful! I was visiting a friend in NYC last week, and we decided to try out your restaurant with a few friends
Being from New Orleans, we have many great restaurants down here
but I loved Cuba!!! The music added an extra touch also!  Thanks for serving such a great mojito
It was absolutely the best I've ever had!  I was wondering if there was any way that I could get the recipe for the mojito?  Thanks again for a memorable dinner!
Just to warn you, reservations dont mean anything
I had a reservation and ended up waiting over an hour to be seated! The place is so tiny, you couldn't wait anywhere but outside
And if you don't keep checking up on the hostess, then you will have to wait longer
Once seated in my very cramped area, I managed to enjoy an ok meal until I accidentally burnt my wrist
The waiter failed to mention that the plate was piping hot didn't have anything for me to put on my burn
I wouldn't come back here again
Such a bad experience!
After seeing an ad in Gourmet about private parties, I booked one for a friend of mine in the downstairs private room
The food was great - and what a value! Perfect atmosphere for a party
I LOVE this place!!! The band is AMAZING and can really get the crowd going
The bartenders and servers are all great and super friendly
They all look like they are just having a good time and enjoying themselves, even though they are working
This effervescence transfers itself over to the customers who look like they are having an equally fun time
Just a warning that the sangria and mojito can knock you OUT! My only complaint is that the area is too small, so that you can't just get a drink or shake your booty a little
Definitely get a dinner reservation so that you have a seat to listen to the band
Best mojitos in the city!! Maybe even best mojitos north of Havana
Great live salsa music
A lot of fun and the food was excellent
Despite having a reservation, we waited for over an hour for a table
Lucky for them, the food made up for the wait
Great food at good prices
Would return, but probably wouldn't bother to make a reservation
Cuba is a GREAT restaurant, in capital letters
I was there with my wife and son and I was promptly seated
I ordered Solomillo de Vaca and Paella Valenciana for my wife and wow were they delicious!!, no wonder the place was packed
The site was marvellous, the service, the music, the ambience, everything makes this place worth visiting many, many times
No wonder people keep telling that this restaurant is NUMERO UNO in New York!!
The terrible service more than erased any positive impression I might have gotten from the food which was ok at best
I made a reservation weeks in advance for a party of 10 (which I confirmed about 3X with the manager)
When we got there, the waitstaff ignored us and then gave us the runaround about who to speak to have our reservation honored
When we were finally seated, the waiters proceeded to stare us down so we could order quickly
Ironically, however, we had to flag people down to even get drink orders filled
When we were done, they tried to stare us down presumably to rush us out asap and started clearing the table before we even finished getting up from it
This is NYC and there are so many good restaurants to spend your hard-earned money at; this is not one of them
Although we waited for an hour past our reservations, I still enjoyed Cuba
There was a live band playing Cuban music and the drinks were great, if you can get the bartender's attention
The hostess was apologetic about the wait time
However, the food and sangria certainly made up for it
we had a wonderful meal and a wonderful experience all thanks to our waiter tony
i would definitely go back the food was wonderful and very reasonable
I made a reservation for a Friday night at 9 pm
We didn't even get seated until well after 10 pm
Once we sat down, it took forever for the waiter to take our order
He never refilled our drink order and we had to go the bar and get drinks ourselves
The food was delicious, but the service was possibly the worst I've ever experienced in a restaurant that charges as much as it does
Don't go here unless there's no crowd
The food is good, but not worth the bad service
One of the best places in NY to eat Cuban and Spanish food
The ambience and the people who serve are really great
You gotta try the Paella and the Solomillo de Vaca, great taste!!!
Mojitos are readily served, so you can't complain about service
For me, it's the best Cuban restaurant in town, go and see it for yourself!!!
After going for dinner at Cuba
I understand the fascination that New Yorkers have with the Cuban culture
This place has a really nice warm ambiance and the night I went with some friends the place was full of beautiful people
I wish that they had some of those cds for sale cause that music was really good
We were so happy with our food and man those mohitos were out of sight
In one word, this restaurant is THE BEST in town, you gotta go and see it for yourself
After making a reservation and then waiting by the bar for 40 minutes, we were then seated only by myself approaching the hostess to remind her we were there
Ordering at the bar, the bartender pretended to make a drink with contents I requested and turned the bottle around so I wouldn't see what he really put in the drink
I knew at this point we were heading for disaster
We were then seated in the highest traffic area, and the food was marginal at best if you eat a lot of Latin food
The greatest thing about Cuba is the live music which I can listen to cheaper on the other side of town
I do not recommend getting sucked in to all the hype!
Unfortunately this cute little place has the rudest servers I have ever encountered in NYC
Our server was a rude older gentlement who didnt even think we deserved a simple HELLO
And dont even think that anyone else will want to help out if your server is chit-chatting with the bartender for 15 minutes or more
If you dont mind bad service this is your place, if not there are great other latin restaurants in NYC with great service!
I was in Cuba for a romantic dinner and everything was perfect
We tried the mojitos, and really are the best mojitos in town as everybody says
The food was exelent, the Empanadas with tomatillo sauce were great
we tried the Paella Marinera perfect
The live music great very romantic
And the prices really afordables
I reccomend this place
The worst dining in NYC in many years! After leaving the traditional 15% tip, the waiter ran after us for half a block to confront
In his opinion, the tip was too low - he expected at least 20% added to the taxed total
His dissatisfaction ended with heavy profanities that I will not quote here
If you are looking to be cursed at for leaving 15% tip, you know where to go
Real cuban food at very reasonbale prices
The atmosphere was electric w/ latin muisic playing
live and via DJ

We were a goup of 10 people out celebrating a birthday
My friend made reservations and called to confirm twice
When we got there, they made us wait 40 minutes for our table
The hostess was rude and the manager was no help at all
In fact, I saw him get chewed out by another angry customer outside the restaurant
We were finally seated in an area that should probably only fit 6 people - everyone felt pretty crowded
On the plus side, the food was good (not very expensive, too) and our waiter was great
After making reservations two weeks before and confirming 3x by phone, we went to Cuba for a birthday dinner for ten; eight of us showed up five minutes before the reservation and stepped into CHAOS
We were told by a frenzied hostess to wait at the bar
Five minutes later, the remaining two of our party showed up

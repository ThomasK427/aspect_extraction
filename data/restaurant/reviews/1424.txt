Some of the best pizza I've had (definitely on par with Grimaldi's and Lombardi's)
The other entrees are delicious and the service is wonderful (the same two owners are there almost every night)
The decor is a little lacking, but everything else more than makes up for that
After months of anticipation for their opening, Anthony's came through!!! It was worth the wait
Went their Friday night with a friend
Place was full, but we were seated quickly
Must try eggplant parm
which was sent out to us, compliments of one of the owners, Louie
We orderd the baked clams, which were some the best I've I had in a while
Louie recommened we try the pizza, being it was our first time visting
He was confident we would be back to try the rest of the menu and boy was he right! The pizza was chard to perfection and the fresh mozz
was nice creamy
Finally made it in to try a pie today
Whole pies only
Went at lunch and had margarita + extra cheese + sun-dried tomatoes
As soon as we sat down, bread and olive oil came
Manager checked on us and was very friendly
Pie + 2 sodas = $20
We went on a Sunday for the Sunday Ragu (the owner's mother's pasta sauce with meatballs, brocciole, and ribs)
We ended up ordering the stuffed mushrooms, which were just right, and the margherita pizza, which is thin crust and perfect in every way
We waited around because we were so pleased and ordered the Ragu when it was ready aorund 4:00
Let me say, this is the closest thing to my grandmother's sauce that I ever had; the sauce and rigatoni were excellent and the meats were so tender
We talked to Joe and one of the owners, Sal, and they couldn't have been nicer
There is such a great family atmosphere here
The desserts are even amazing
We had the chocolate cake and the best homemade cannoli I've ever had
We plan on making this a Sunday tradition, and we will bring family and friends to this wonderful establishment
I decided to be one of the first people to get a pie and, after the first bite, I knew that this would be one of my favorite spots in the Slope
The service is super-friendly and it really does feel like it's a family run business
If you're on 7th Ave, this is the place to get a pizza!
I love Ammos
The spreads and bread was amazing- thier selection in Greek wines out-did my expectations and the entrees served were beyond delicious
A plus for Ammos!
What a terrific experience! My first visit to Ammos was excellent all around: from the very pleasant hostesses who greeted us at the door, to the delicious appetizers, main course and desserts (Greek Coffee Ice Cream-my favorite highly recommended), great music, to the extremely friendly Maitre D' that came over to our table to check on our experience
We had at least 5 of the appetizers on the menu, which all were delicious
Must try the Octopus (the best I have had in NYC)!!! Everything was way beyond our expectations
I have returned numerous times since my first visit and it seems as if it gets better every time
I highly recommend Ammos if you are looking for GREAT Greek food!
the food was absoultely excellent, i enjoyed the great service i was getting, the food made me feel like i was traveling through different parts of greece, the wine was great, i went the other night, not willing to try a new restaurant, but im happy i did,i went on a saturday night and they had greek music , im not sure if its everydasy but it was truly comfortable and enjoyable, i will most likely attend again
We went there for our first anniversary and had a great time and a wonderful dinner
Ammos offered an authentic menu with great wines from Greece
I will definately go there again
We came here for lunch and thought the food and service were excellent
The food was so flavorful and I had the vegetarian dishes
The others in my group had the seafood and other items and thought the food was wonderful as well
The dessert was absolutely delicious
I would definitely come again
My visit to Ammos was a great experience
The food, the service and the atmoshphere were all excellent
Finally, a place in NYC I can tell people to go to when they ask me for a good Greek restaurant
It is a nice restaurant where you can spend some time to feel the delicacy of the Greek sea-food paired with the nice and very refreshing wines, in a fine ambient taken from the islands of Greece in the company of the Greek music and an attentive service
Ammos has excellent service and the food is delicious
I highly recomend this restaurant
Greek food at a different leval
The best in town, have to try it
Most BBQ places in NYC have bad BBQ and are over priced - not a good combination
Being a North Carolina native, I am quite picjy when it comes to barbeque, but Sawa is great
No, it's not entirely authentic Carolina BBQ, it has a japanese twist
And the best part? A Sandwhich, roll, a side, and a piece of pie cost me $7, which is unheard of in New York, even at a street cart
And Sawa's sweet potato pie was awesome!
This is such a fun place to go to, for kids and adults
The food is great, not necessarily anything to write home about but everything we ate - burger, veggie burger - was savory
Loved the sweet potato fries! And it's cool that you can get root beer floats, shakes, rickeys or a drink from the next door bar as a beverage
The shakes, malts, floats are awesome
Those watching their calorie intake beware: though there are healthy choices here (grilled chicken, etc), it's tough to bypass all the delicious fun choices you can get here instead! Service was very friendly
We were 4 adults and 2 young kids on a Saturday around 7pm
The place was nearly empty
The two tvs they have were blaring and another family left on account of the news
We placed our drink orders and waited 15 minutes for them to arrive
The vanilla egg cream I got was great but a companion's cappacino was all froth and tasted burnt
We then ordered ice cream and waited another 30 minutes for that
My ice cream arrived as a soup
The brownie was stale
Also, one of the children's sundaes never arrived
One of the adults said that his sundae was great
For our inconveniences the waiter took a large chunk off the bill
What more could you ask for? The food is delicious- homemade fries, excellent burger (veggie burger is quite yummy), and the malts are out of this world
The staff is extremely pleasant and helpful
When I'm in the mood for comfort food, Homer's always comes through for me!!
And I mean that in the best possible way
It's the type of malt shop you've seen in old movies
Handmade malts and shakes, jukebox, funky interior and seriously cool folks who hang there
The burgers were da BOMB! Bring the kids!!!
This place is chill
Good burgers and frys, lot's of choices of different kinds of frys- shoestring,curlys,waffle, etc
great hot dogs, fish and chips and now they are doing home made soups which are terrific, I had the minestrone
The service is good and the place has a really nice neigborhood diner buzz to it
Oh yeah they have air hockey in the game room in the back
When did they get here?
This place has been a godsend to our neighborhood
You can't go wrong anytime of day here
Breakfasts sandwiches are the best in the neighborhood, the potato chips are way too addictive and for dinner the steak tips, mac n'cheese and beef stew are awesome
How on earth is this place only rated an 8
4? It's fantastic! I signed up so I could write a review
My boyfriend and I stopped in for the first time during the Blizzard of 2006 and had a delicious lunch of butternut ginger squash soup and what was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in NYC! (roastbeef with roquefort cheese, lettuce tomato on whole grain
mmm) They even serve my favorite, sweet potato fries! The people were so friendly and the place is adorable
Although it does only have one table and a few stools at the window so it's best for takeout or a small group
I will definitely be back!
I have never written a citysearch review but of course do read them when I want to check a place out
And, if any place warrants a glowing review it is Chicory

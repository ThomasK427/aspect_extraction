You are bombarded with a team of great service
From bow-tied and jacketed host to impecible linguistic Captain to an unbelievable wait staff
Great seating, had a six pm reservation
We were the first table in the joint
It was half filled at eight
Only thing on the menu written in English were the descriptions of the entrees, so brush up on your basic Italian(or bring Italian girlfriend)
Lots of Veal and Chicken selections
Solid pastas and plenty of great sounding specials
The food was the best I hav had in a long time
I highly recomend it
Servers are very approachable and helpful
Ask for the best seat in the house when making reservation or ask the table in far corner
You can apprietiate the great room best

Everything was excellent
The food is the best Tuscany in NYC
The ambience is splendid
It works for either high powered business meeting or a romantic evening
The service was superb
I could not ask for better
The value is excellent
The food was so tasty for the money
The overall experience was amazing, I cannot say enough good things about Acappella
My bridal shower was held here on a Saturday afternoon
Everyone raved how the atmosphere was perfect, the food was delicious and the staff was great
It was a wonderful day and it the restaurant was the perfect place to have it
I have can't wait to go back and enjoy the meal!!
A pretty place, mediocre food and slow service, and one that nickels and dimes you and makes the evening infuriating and unpleasant
As for their famously moderate prices, alas theyre not any more
Beware the waiters innocuous questions
May I recommend a special glass of wine? How different can it be from the $7 glasses on the menu? $18 a glass
You ladies want to split a salad appetizer, may I put on two separate plates? Thats $7
00
You arent interested in our desserts, how about a fruit platter? Whod have thought that a little fruit would cost so much more than a Napoleon?   And if its raining, hold onto your umbrella someone else may want it, and theyll get it too
I think I know who took it
Well call you if it turns up
Um, wouldnt that require you asking for my name and number? Oh, oops
Great food for a VERY reasonable price - the faire was the standard fusion cuisine (combining French/Asian etc) that many restuiraunts provide, but it was done perfectly and at half the cost of the others
Attentive service and prompt lunch timing of the food made it ideal for an extended business lunch - and the $20
00 prix fix lunch is GREAT
Whenever I visit NYC, I always expect to eat at a restaurant with snooty service and poor food quality
But Rouge defied all of my negative expectations of NYC restaurants
After years of dining experience in NYC, this is the best restaurant in New York! They have an excellent vegetarian menu and the best wait staff
The wait staff was so incredibly attentive and never once let my glass of wine stay empty
The prices were unbeatable and an excellent value
Rouge was the perfect choice for New Year's Eve!!! The staff was friendly and efficient, the atmosphere warm and inviting, and the food beyond expectations
We had the special tasing menu (regular and vegetarian) and were thrilled
We weren't rushed at all so we had the time to enjoy all of the above
I had the Petit Syrah- it will be a new addition to my list of favorite wines
In a word, Rouge was: Spectacular!
Perfectly executed elements come together to create a wonderful dining experience
Elegant surroundings, delicious imaginative dishes, extraordinary wines, attentive service and value priced
My wife and I dined at Rouge after receiving a glowing recommendation from a friend
We were not disappointed
It is a romantic restaurant on the east side that is definitely worth the visit
Dinner for two including a bottle of wine and tip cost appox
$150
00
I had the $45
00 tasting menu and was a little disappointed at the overall flavors,but my wife had the vegetarian tasting menu which both of us would recommend
I've dined here a few times, trying different dishes each visit, and have always been pleased
One time I ordered a Dubonnet aperitif and they didn't have it so the maitre d' went to a liquor store to purchase a bottle
The ambiance is warm, yet elegant, and the prices are unbelievably reasonable
Highly recommended!
Don't even bother looking for eggs on the menu at weekends - they are not here! Thank heavens! Saturday lunchtime it's wonderful to have a proper grown-up lunch and the choice is excellent! They have kept the $20
02 menu for the summer and it's superb, especially the lamb with the risoto
They also they do an excellent value tasting menu with 5 or 6 courses, an amazing array of flavours and textures - for $35 is quite stunning value
Excellent choice of wines and very little mark-up
The upstairs dining room is very pretty - I must go back to dinner
don't know what this place is like at night - but it is not worth the effort to go for brunch - the service is terrible! food so-so
they didn't have orange juice at all! that doesn't compute - breakfast + orange juice - go to the market on the corner if you have to! i had to ask for coffee twice
get a clue!
This place is fabolous
went there for drinks with friends, the people are so friendly and the staff is too nice! i definitely recommend this for late night hanging out!
The Scene If the dining room looks empty, look again
Chances are the garden out back is hopping, with happy Slopers sipping wines that start less than $20 per bottle and munching on more than a dozen kinds of pressed sandwiches
It's not exactly a "wine bar" as the sign says, but it's certainly a bright and airy choice for lunch or dinner, with or without the vino
The Food Pressed sandwiches make a flawless transition from day to night, always warm and satisfying if done just right
And these are
Choose from Italian-cured soppressetta, Cuban-inspired homemade roast pork and pickles or a delicious home-roasted turkey and cheese
Vegetarian options abound as well
The owners focus on fresh local ingredients such as Hudson Valley apples, New York sharp cheddar and chewy ciabatta bread from nearby Uprising Bakery
Kids can order pressed PB
Always a good sandwich for anybody on your list--from veggies to babies
Staff is considerate, and patient
Gets too crowded during lunch--but that's a good sign!! #14 w/goat cheese
I get serious cravings for Press 195's Hudson Salad and walk all the way over from Windsor Terrace for it
This place is the best! The sandwhiches are great too
Excellent bread and fresh ingredients
Ate here with large group of relatives ranging from ages 10-70
Everyone found something they loved
I love #10!!! It's a good option when you don't want to spend a lot of money in a dinner!
This place is great

The coconut-wood tabletops--once used to support the occasional dancing model--are now more likely to be propping up glasses of wine
The Draw Pop and French techno--from a DJ booth topping the see-through wine cellar--gets increasingly ear-splitting as the night plays on
The food--$60 for a flight of appetizers for two--is rather pricey (especially when it leaves you craving a slice of pizza on the way home)
Consider splurging instead on the delicious French martinis, blended with Chambord, pineapple juice and vanilla vodka
the menu isn't that extraordinary
cramped seating
overpriced for the low quality of food
loud and noisy especially when the restaurant turns into a bar scene after dinner service
I planned our company Christmas party at Meet and while the food and atmosphere were excellent, the staff (especially the bartenders) were extremely rude
Given the transit strike, only 40 of the 60 people made it to the party
We asked that they keep the bar open for an hour longer given that we paid for 20 people who were not even there and that most people were an hour late to the party given the traffic
they flat out refused to do anything for us
Did they really think they would have had a crowd on a Wednesday night during the transit strike? Given their Grinch attitude, I will never return
Moral of the story - an extra hour of drinks would have cost them nothing and now it has cost them many customers
Extremely overpriced, greasy, and bland sandwiches
Service was so awful, it is hard to know where to begin
We were seated promptly for brunch but were left there unattended for about 10 minutes
Ordered hamburgers w/fries, 2 Grey Goose and tonics and two waters
Waited another 10 mintues but still no waters so I reminded the waiter that we ordered drinks and waters
We waited another 5 - 10 minutes amd Greygoose arrived but still no water
Asked again for waters
We received the greasiest hamburger and saltiest fries you can imagine
We had to blot the grease from the burgers with paper -- still no waters
Finally, I went to bar to request waters, made them fill glasses there and carried to the table myself
They never came back to us to check on the food or ask if we wanted more drinks or water
I went into Meet for dinner around 8pm on Thursday night, with zero expectations
I had looked at the menu beforehand, and appreciated some of the unique options the menu had to offer
Most of the restaurants in the meatpacking district offer bland options, with high prices, and a highly pretentious attitude
At Meet I found the service to be wonderful (granted, it wasnt very busy), the food to be an excellent value, the ambience to be cool and casual
All of my food was craftily prepared, cooked at all the right temperatures
The wine list was beyond reasonable
I reccommend the risotto and gnocchi appetizers as well as the filet and lobster tail
The chocolate cake was also a tremendous dessert
I went into Meet this Saturday night with my boyfriend after another restaurant lost our reservations
It looked pretty busy when we walked in, so I was sure that we were going to have to go somewhere else
The hostess was really sweet, and really went out of her way to get us a table, even though they were so busy
We were told the wait would be like 15-20 minutes, but we were actually seated much faster than that
When we got to the table it was a little too close to the table next to it, but the whole place was tight so we didn't complain
Our waiter was wonderful, and the food and service were far above what I've come to expect out of the MPD
I would not know anyhting about brunch, but dinner was wonderful! I'll be back, and this time, I'll make reservations!
We went for brunch last Sunday and it was the worst brunch ever
The waiter did not know the menu, and was very unaccomidating about substutions
We asked for French Fries instead of Home Fries with our omlette he said that they were out of French Fries
then 5 minutes later we see another waiter bring out French Fries to another group!! The food was also terrible
The cesaer salad was just plain NASTY and the omlettes were boring
Not worth the time or the $$$
As we get seated on a Friday night, the place was empty! The service was very pushy, as we were finishing up our main course, they would bring us the check already!! Of course we asked for desert
The Creme Burle is outrageous, although, I would have to say, MEET was the first place EVER to rush us out of the restaurant
They practically told us to wrapp up our conversations and leave! Never ever was I told from any upscale places such a thing
FOOD? Not too special,, you can definately find other restaurants with better steak and seafood
I HAVE BEEN IN MANY NICE PLACES BUT MEET IS JUST BEAUTIFUL
NOT TOO BIG BUT JUST RIGHT
THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD AND THE STAFF WAS FRIENDLY
MY FRIENDS AND I HAD A GREAT TIME, DJ WAS GOOD TOO
WE THINK THAT THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PLACE TO GO IN THE MEAT PACKING DISTRICT IF NOT IN ALL OF N
Y
Meet is awful
Last night I made a reservation on Open Table
When I got there, they denied my reservation saying they had no record of it
Despite that blunder, no apologies were made and the host (he says he is the owner) was incredibly rude
After that, we sat down and had a terrible waiter who never once came to check on us, ask us if we wanted more wine -- or really anything
You know it is bad when you have to ask the bus boy for everything
As I left, the host did nothing to fix his restaurant's terrible behavior
I say -- why bother? It is very BT anyway
I through my sisters suprise party here in november
We had the private room all to ourselves
The bartenders were very punctual and extremely helpful
They took care of all my guest and really made the party go smoothly
Service was great food was great and drinks were faboulous
It was the perfect size room and had a very nice decor
We had a great time
will book future parties here
If you are of the distressfully hip crowd, or perhaps think you are, this is the place for you
But if you are interested in a lively, unpretentious atmosphere, look elsewhere
Besides, the drinks are ridiculously expensive, the service is slow, the food is at best average, and it is loud to the point of distraction
I find myself at Meet quite often and love it
The staff is great fun and the bartenders are amazing and cute
It can get loud, but no louder than any other place that gets loungy in the later hours
And every time I eat there the food is incredible
I am yet to have a negative experience
Plus the ambience couldn't be better
The place is hip, but not trying too hard and I always have a blast!
I went to MEET with 3 girlfriends last weekend
We had a delicious dinner the crab cakes were the best! The bartenders were kinda hot
And I really liked the artwork on the walls, they were very dramatic
I have such a great time in the meatpacking district so glad that there are more places coming up
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business! shame! Went there last night for a drink, and realized (too late) that the wine I was drinking was $14 a glass!!! NO WAY!!!we're in the cool and trendy meatpacking district!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not recommend MEET at all, it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in!
It was a first time experience and definately a last at the MEET
Prices were through the roof
The Bulgarian house wines by the glass were served by the spoonfull at twice the price of any other restaurant in town and were rancid
The quality and design of the decor are let down by the lack lusture quality of the food, wine and service
Very dissapointed in the food
Very dull and soggy Frisee salad, small and over cooked rib-eye, taste was ok, sides were bland, fries soggy
Waite service was good, shoudl know nad have their wines, ambience fine
But for the price, this place should be a lot better
We had ideal valentine dinner
The set menu was exceptional , live latino band during the dinner playing soft music gave it added romantic touch , only to be fallowed by a very good D
J
who helped to make this evening not only romantic but exciting as well
Full marks to MEET for it's touch of class

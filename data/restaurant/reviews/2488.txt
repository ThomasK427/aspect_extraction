The Goi Du Du (green papaya salad) is fantastic
The spare ribs are phenomenal and a bargain
The soups are terrific
Ga Sate (Chicken in peanut sauce) is unique and wonderful
The Bo Luc Loc (steak cubes) will satify any meat eater - cooked perfectly every time
The beauty of saigon grill is in the consistency and the food comes out fast every time
I don't know how they do it, I'm just glad they do
I have been fond of Saigon Grill for years for the incredible food, fast and reliable service, and modest prices
Unfortunately, we've had bad experiences with the new location
We waited for almost an hour (when they had told us 30 minutes max), the service was unfriendly, and it was noisy (attempts to curtail this with random pieces of foam failed)
The food, however, was fantastic
I will continue to relish their victuals but will only dine-in at odd hours
I think I'll primarily stick to take-out
(addendum 11/22/02): Now I have to rethink takeout
we ordered tonight clearly for pickup and when I walked the 10 blocks to get it, they told me that the food was being delivered and that I had made a mistake
Apparently the delivery guy was less then gracious as well
BE CLEAR WHEN YOU ORDER
Unfortunately, their infrastructure hasn't caught up to their popularity
This place is great - it's inexpensive and delicious
Best for take out - one entree will definitely feed two people
We read the good reviews here and decided to give it a try, since we love authentic Vietnamese
We ordered the the ginger chicken and another chicken dish (the ordered names escape us)
As soon as it was brought to us, we knew we had been had! 100% chinese! What a disappointment since we both hate chinese food
The two dishes we ordered differed only in sweetness!! If you want authentic Vietnamese I suggest going down to the Vietnamese area of Chinatown
My favorite Vietnamese restaurant, and quite possibly my favorite restaurant
Pho bo, green papaya salad, crystal dumplings, vegetarian curry, and barbequed beef are unbelievably delicious
Always crowded at dinner, even on Mondays
They just moved to a bigger location (thank god) so there's more room to sit down and someplace to wait if you do take-out
Good Food
Fast and Polite Service
Nice Ambience
Reasonable Prices
Worth it
Best Vietnamese food in NYC at a great price
Their new upper west side location (they moved around the corner to Amsterdam) is a huge improvement -- more spacious and better decor
You still may have to wait some before you are seated, but their near McDonalds-speed service makes up for it
For the same food with less of a wait (and less frenetic environment), try the upper east side location
The place to eat Vietnamese, this side of Manhattan
My personal favorite: Grandma's Sweet Rice Dumplings! No meal is complete without it
The food is fabulous -- fresh, just the right spices -- and there isn't a faster takeout city in Manhattan
If you're hungry and you just can't wait, this is the place to call
If you're eating there, expect lines but everyone moves in and out fairly quickly so the wait is rarely too long
The papaya salad and the shrimp curried soup are always good bets
I will never go here again! The food was terrible
The service was terrible
Should of just stayed home and ate dog food!
I don't go to Mary Ann's for the food, period
I can get better Mexican food elsewhere
I go because they have good margaritas (large margarita royale on the rocks no salt)
On a warm summer afternoon, my lady and I get a seat outside, drink our margaritas, with the very good special guacamole as an accompaniment, and watch the world go by
Louie's is exactly the kind of place where one COULD eat every day
They've got a great, diverse menu full of food that falls somewhere between comfort food and haute cuisine---reliable and tasty, yet a little creative
This place is an old-school style classic neighborhood spot
If you're eating out, but your not sure what you want, give Louie's a try!
Great neighborhood place
My personal favorite: Scallops over Pesto Risotto (outrageous)
Fabulous regular menu with dishes from home-style meatloaf to Broiled Lamb Chops with Potato/Pear Gratin cilantro/garlic chimichurri
Creative specials everyday
Friendly staff that make you feel at home
A good place to relax
have a glass of wine - good list
Calamari isn't bad either
Service is well
New York style
Quiet in the afternoons
Whenever I go to this restaurant I've never had one bad experience
The staff were always helpful, polite courteous
Every server we've had was always great the food is never disappointing
The price is unbeatable the ambience is even better
Nice place to have a date and dine casually on a weekly basis
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends family since I've always had such a great time here
The calamari is great so is the shrimp scampi
The resturant is outstanding
The service is very attentive
Food is excellent; especially the specials
Nice place for a date
Drinks are good, too
Could use an update on red wine list
I recommend, and I'm picky!
The service needs a great deal to be desired
Also, the food quality has slipped
Become too commercial for its own goos - I think this place has seen better days - time to look for the next haunt
As it goes in NYC, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time
I visited Bella Luna by accident
my best friend and I were walking down Columbus Ave one night and we asked a passing woman where a good place to eat was
she recommended Bella Luna
what an exquisite meal we had! From the bread dipped in Olive Oil to the mouth-watering pasta dishes
the ambiance is very relaxing and quiet
a great place for a romantic dinner or even just a night out with friends
On the bright side, our server was polite and friendly, definitely the best aspect of the establishment
From the street, where we were weary of walking, the Diner looked like just what we wanted-- clean, air-conditioned, spacious
We ordered a turkey burger and a turkey sandwich
Both were bland and undistinguished
It didn't seem worth the money or the calories
It might be good when you're desperate at 3 AM, but for lunch or dinner you can do better
The menu is extensive, there's a large selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner and desert
The service was fast and friendly and the place was quiet with a definite mix crowd
Definitely a good place if your looking for a late night meal with a date, friends or family
My partner and I are in the city to apartment-sit on the UWS 3-4 times/year
We end up at City Diner most nights 3AMish

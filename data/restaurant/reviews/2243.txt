If you're a regular, you might even get a complimentary cookie platter the size of a gondola
Good food, prompt service
Perfect setting for a relaxing evening
Try the scallops, you won't be disappointed
The best part was the fact that they don't rush you through your meal, even when they are packed
Honestly, I am not a big fan of dining in Midtown
The restaurants always have mediocre food and the atmosphere, well, is very blah
Remi is a great place for italian food before or after a show
The placed is not filled with tourists and buisness men
Try the risotto
Great food and great presentation! Great service from the staff! Great environment!  In the sea of Italian restaurants, this is truely one of the best! The dishes are prepared and presented in a way that stands appart!
We loved the service and food at Remi
They have a great $30 prix fixe dinner with a good number of choices
However, both times we went there for dinner, they failed to include the prix fixe menu
We had to ask for it
We think they do not want you to order from it because it is a very good deal
The wait staff does not even mention the possibility to any of the diners
This was our only complaint about this great restaurant
Terrific food - the owner has pride in the quality and authenticity
Try the stuff that is not standard fare and you will not be disappointed - it's worth taking a chance
Excellent value; good food, well worth the visit, simple surroundings
This is a cute neighborhood restaurant that has wonderful food at reasonable prices - the rosemary potatos are delicious, as is their grilled seafood! We've gone several times and never been disappointed! Great place for a casual, delicious dinner!
Homemade food at our local Hellenic Orthodox Church festival is the only Greek cooking I have had that equals this place on this side of the Atlantic, and they do fish as well as some of the little tavernas in the Plaka
They make OK hummus but only give one piece of pita and charge 75 cents if you ask for another
Come on guys, it's a dip, not soup
and it's just a piece of bread!
I have NEVER been to a Greek restaurant that was such a disappointment! The food was bland, the service was inadequate and knew NOTHING about Greek food and the atmosphere was sterile
Try another place for Greek dining
That includes Astoria
I have never been to Greece but I have had GREAT Greek food
I am happy to find a soild Greek eatery in the city, but I still pine for those in the midwest
The Greek Kitchen ranks very high on the list
However, if you have been to a Greek restaurant in Chicago or Detroit you won't be as impressed
This goes for Mexican food in the New York area too
Next time you are in Detroit or Chicago try a Greek restaurant, any Greek restaurant and you will know what I am talking about
It is a verry nice restaurant with a verry good food and service
I have been often in Greece, the kitchen was not better there
This is a great Greek restaurant
Its inexpensive and consistantly good
I no longer need to travel into Astoria for non-overpriced good greek food
Furthermore, the Greek Kitchen is cleaner, better run, and far friendlier than most Astoria Greek establishments
Service is consistantly good
Food is consisatntly tasty
Great place for a casual lunch or a nice pre-Lincoln Center dinner
The ambience is both classy and casual
I strongly recommend it
Friends and I stopped by Saturday night for dinner
Place was empty and we were shown a table by the rude manager/owner
I have been to this restaurant a number of times and I have never been treated so rudely
As we looked at the menu and the wine list, my friend overheard the manager comment to a waitress about me that the least he could do is wear a button down shirt, and not show up dressed like a Gristede's boxcutter
My friends and I dine at some of the best restaurants in New York and comparitively this place is at best a low tier Bennigan's
With that we abruptly left and walked up the street to a restaurant where they appreciate your business - El Azteca
Avoid this place like the plague
We went to Vintage on a Saturday night in February because wed heard about the great drink menu
After asking for a menu, the bartender let us know that there was a new chef and the menu was in transition
Everyone had a great time drink- and meal-wise
When we returned about a month later there was a list of specials and a slightly changed menu
So far weve all been very happy with the food
Its so much better than regular bar food and it complements the drink menu
The fun in each return trip is ordering a different entre and a new drink
I went to Vintage for drinks on a Friday night with 5 friends
There were plenty of seats available, and very comfy at that
The atmosphere was just about perfect, right down to the music
And the martini menu--to die for! I've never seen so many drink choices, and at such reasonable prices
A great place at a great value
I'll definitely go back on my next trip to NYC
I just saw that someone, don't know why, gave this place a thumbs down
I became a citysearch member, just so I could vouch for this spot
Excellent drinks (there martini menu is about 25 pages long), really nice wait staff, great appetizers
I'm going back for sure
Vintage has a cozy atmosphere with reasonable prices and a friendly waitstaff
It's conveniently located right outside the theater district
Overall I had an amazing experience during my visit to Vintage
The food was great, service was great and the Martini's
awesome! Definately a great place to hang out with friends
Superb is the only word to describe my experience at Vintage
Delicious Food, exemplary service and incredible ambiance
Before dinner we had drinks at the Bar
I could not believe they had over 60 different beers to choose from
We had dinner on the patio, and it was quite nice to eat outside
I will be back
At first, the place looked promising, with a cute patio at back
Beer and mixed drink selection was good
But the food was awful--the hamburger I ordered tasted bitter, and my friend's calamari was barely fried
A disappointment for dinner, though perfectly fine if you're just looking to drink
I had my birthday party here and it was a great experience! The staff were more than happy to accomodate us
The atmosphere was great and so were the Drinks, Music, and Food
Everyone had such a great time - I would definitely recommend this place for your next event
I will have my party here again next year
I can not say enough about how fantastic Vintage is! The Martini list is unbelivable, the service is outstanding and the atmosphere cannot be beat
It is very difficult to find a bar with a cool vibe, absolutely no pretension and superb food
The crowd was a great mix of people too
I was impressed with Vintage I absolutely recommend this place
Truly the best bar in the city! I have never seen such a selection of Martinis
They must have 160 different ones to pick from, and there Beer selection is crazy with over 60 different beers
I will definitely be back to try all the rest
It is refreshing to find a place where the service is both curteous and friendly
Without a doubt an enjoyable experience that I look forward to repeating!
I had dinner there last night as I always do when I go into to see a show
The food is great and they have a wonderful selection of martinis and beer- rarely do Ifind a place that serves Magic Hat

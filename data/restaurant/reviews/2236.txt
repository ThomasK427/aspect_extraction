opened up in Hells Kitchen, it would put this dump out of business
Don't know if it's the cilantro or onions, but they serve the best salsa in the city
This is a great dive bar for good margaritas and cheap eats! Friendly service although it can be slow at lunchtime!
The Scene Teak ceilings soar above well-spaced tables appointed with caramel leather chairs; the occasional Asian accent provides color and flair
And while a few serious food-lovers may be spotted, perhaps at corner tables, it's suit-and-tie businessmen that abound, sealing deals over efficiently paced tasting menus
Professional servers keep things flowing effortlessly, if somewhat humorlessly
The Food Chef Eric Ripert's French seafood is expertly cooked
Escolar is poached in olive oil until exquisitely tender; barely cooked scallops, prawns and clams happily loll in a decadent, buttery sauce topped with sea urchin and caviar
A flight of four fluke ceviches is equally intriguing
But the knockouts just barely outnumber the less-inspired dishes, such as salmon carpaccio out-muscled by its yuzu accompaniment, and a similarly unbalanced dish of lobster and bacon-laced sauerkraut
Desserts, however, don't disappoint, particularly the milk chocolate-caramel egg with a wisp of sea salt
Having lived in NYC for 7 yrs now, I've heard a lot about this place and was very excited to try it
Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed
The crowd was older
The menu was, for the most part, all seafood, and while fairly good, it is easy to find MUCH better in the city
The appetizers and entrees were not very inventive and the flavor was fairly bland
The best I had during my meal was the raw tuna - great flavor and large portion for an appetizer
While service was friendly and attentive, it was otherwise not noteworthy
The space itself has past its prime
The dining room is not ornate or luxurious, but rather dated with yellow wood decor that reeks of the 70s
I would maybe recommend this place for a power lunch (much like Aquavit), but for dinner there are so many places in NYC that leave this place miles behind in cuisine, decor and service
Definitely not worth the high price tag for an average meal and ambiance
My girlfriend and I had the standard four course meal -- and every dish was fabulous -- fresh, fragrant, full of interesting flavor combos around the world
Fluke tasting, the kanpachi with wasabi fish roe, soft shell crab with a spicy pumpkin broth, sea urchin (like butter/foie gras), skate pork, monkfish with a chorizo emulsion -- just increadibly creative and tasty combos
(who thinks of cooking Fish with pork!) Desert were unreal as well -- a green tea/yuzu ice cream with grapefruit and rice crispies! who would think that citrus could complement a dairy
Service was attentive, a bit stiff, and never intrusive (as in they don't drop the food and then brag about every ingrediant in the dish)
We gave the sommelier the go ahead on wine from $60-$80 and he came in with a loire valley at $55 based on our preferences
The only off note was the amuse bouche of poached lobster in cucumber broth -- flavor good, the lobster a bit chewy and overcooked
I think the creativity rivals WD50 with better (larger) portion sizes
Haven't been to Masa or Per Se, but compared to the other 2 and 3 star joints I've been to, this is tops
I recently had a birthday dinner at Le Bernardin, and must say it was a perfect place for the occasion
We had Le Bernardin Tasting Menu with wine paring, which I highly recommend
Each of the seven courses presented a different personality and was paired perfectly with the wine selection
They were all excellent, but two courses definitely stood out for me: scallop ceviche and sea urchin custard
The scallop sang in my mouth, and the sea urchin evoked the ocean
In addition, the service was thoughtful and professional, as it should be at a top-notch restaurant like this
Sorry to say this restaurant was a bad experience for me and my family
The staff was rude
We were not seated in a timely manner
The food was average at best
Inedible at worst
We had made resrvation way in advence but the total experince was not worth the money we paid
We felt ripped off
I don't recommend it
We went to this restaurant with high hopes
The truth is that this place fails to deliver
We waited a long time to be seated
Finally we were seated but not attended to
The food was disappointing
I oredred the tuna which was average at best
The ravioli was undercooked, almost frozen
The decor was good, so was the location
The food was overrated, seafood below standard and service terrible
Disappointing! We were made to wait at the bar for four hrs eventually we ate there , sitting on an uncomfortable chair
even though we spent $500 on dinner and wine
The restaurant was only half full and it was very early in the evening
No excuses for such terrible negligent discourteous treatment
This place is a disgrace
The seafood was stale
I've been to many good restaurants in Manhattan
Daniel, Le Grenouille, Alain Ducasse
all first class retaurants with courteous service and fresh food
This restaurant does not compare with the above restaurants
It seems like most people writing reviews of this place are talking their own books
Since they paid so much for so little it must have been worth it
If you are a fish lover you are better off going to Red Lobster
Most people reviewing the place will also try to appeal to your sense of elitism - oh, if you truly enjoy fine food you will love this place, blah blah
But don't fall for it
Buying a beautiful piece of fresh salmon and preparing it at home is much more satisfying
This is NOT the best fish restaurant in America let alone NYC
I was hesistant about going here, with all of the new restaurants on the scene that could have been chosen, but Le Bernardin did not disappoint! Service, food and atmosphere was amazing!
I dined at Le Bernardin alone, which really allowed me to focus on the food
And what food it was! From the starting amuse of poached lobster with coconut/lobster/ginger foam, through the progressive tasting of fluke ceviche, to the pan-fried skate and crispy pork belly with butternut squash mousseline, the quality of the ingredients was impeccable with execution to match
Asian aromatics and techniques may not be to everyone's taste (especially in such a classically French restaurant), but having spent a number of years working in Asia, this is the type of food I would cook if I could
Can't wait to go back again - this time with friends!
After reading all the great reviews, I decided to have lunch here
Food was fantastic - I didn't think Tuna could taste that good
The ambience is rather formal, but service was great
Great value for lunch !
The reviews weren't kidding when they said the service, food, and ambience is great at this restaurant
I never had to worry about my drink being low or my empty plate sitting on the table
This was a great first night dinner in NYC and it was in walking distance to our broadway show later on that night
Call in advance for reservations to get the time you want
They book up months in advance and this place is definately worth it!
Amazing food and impeccable service
This is a truly special dining experience
I recommend going all out and getting the wine pairing
I had a phenomenal dinner at Le Bernadin! It is a rather formal and slightly intimidating restaurant due to the much older crowd that usually dines there but don't let that stop you from sampling this excellent restaurant
It truly serves the best seafood in town
The dishes are creative and the kitchen obviously understands seafood because nothing was over-salted and over-sauced
The tables are nicely spaced apart, so lots of privacy between diners
Everything was prepared to perfection!
Food was very good but nothing moved me
Service was excellent, atmosphere was not stuffy and they were very receptive towards my young nephew
Phenomenal, The most outstanding ambience, service and food! Truly a delight! I wish I can afford to eat here often, the dishes served were heavenly, portion sizes were perfect too make you full but not stuffed! I was treated like royalty and it was the most wonderful NewYork dining experience
They know how much you pay to dine with them and they made every second worth the dollars spent
You will pay a pretty penny to dine at this establishment
Once you've accepted that you will have an experience to last you a lifetime
Everything was impressive and impeccable! If only I could afford to go more often
if you are a foodie you can't pass up this dining experience

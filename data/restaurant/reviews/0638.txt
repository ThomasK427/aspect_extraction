This was one of the most disappointing restaurant I've even been to
They have ridiculous Reservation requirment for party over certain size
I can't see what the hype about this place is
I went on a saturday and the atmosphere was no more exciting than eating dinner at home
The only thing that's pacific hawaiian about it is bar table
They have overly priced food that tasted no better than my local takeout place
Be Careful of the Pupu platter
Is a rip-off
They don't keep a clean tap
We were charge for drinks that we didn't order
I know I sounded like a angry custumer
But I only wanted to let other restaurant beware
The other review about this restaurant was just being on the nice side
Everytime I've gone to wally's, I've had a great time and make a point to bring my out of town guests
It really feels like your getting away
The drinks are great, a bit pricey (but i guess that's the part that reminds you that you're in manhattan) but we always get a volcano bowl of something
Big fan of the tuna poke! The staff is always friendly, a bit silly and really attractive
The one with long black hair and shiny red bikini kills me
probably not from hawaii, but who cares
Definitely worth a visit
This restaurant was just average
My friend I had an early dinner, so there were'nt too many customers
Anyways, for the price, I don't think this place is worth it
The food portions were quite small
My friend I left still hungry
The drinks were good though
The atmosphere was nice
Pretty authentic
Don't come for the food
Atmosphere drinks are a plus
Where else in New York can you go and get lei'd by a pretty girl as well as enjoy a bit of Hawaiian Paradise? It's quite balmy in here (the staff are in bikini's and grass skirts) and the huge water fall make you forget that it's winter outside! The food is pretty good and the drinks are just as colorful and tasty! The bartenders are really cute and the live performances are a plus! Visit the exotic birds and Wally the cockatiel in the darker back room (perfect for a romantic dinner)! Popular with young good looking people
This is New York, good food and eye candy abound -- no need to see a short man hula on a chair or force yourself to eat bad bbq billed as suckling pig
The place was filled with young upper east siders celebrating birthdays
A guy in line for the bathroom told me he had come in to check out the waitresses in bikinis
Skip it -- if you want a fun theme night you can do better at Tortilla Flats
but all about the alcohol and the atmosphere
It's a fun place, but you don't come here to really dine, given the kitchen appears to be shared with Lucky Cheng's which happens to be around the corner
Unless you want really overdone fake Polynesian cuisine
But the drinks are really what makes this place fun, served in tiki glasses and coconut shells
Just make sure you eat beforehand
I had heard about the great drinks, waterfall, hula-clad waitresses and live music cockateel, but I didn't expect such great food
ingredients are super-fresh, sauces are perfect, and nice presentation
The Pu-Pu platter is a must, soooper delish ribs, stuffed shrimp, calamari
Try to catch the Moonlighters (I saw them on a Tuesday)
My girlfriends and I had a great time there the other night
We were kind of bummed about being in the city during a beautiful summer weekend, but being in Wally's was like being shipped off to a mini vacation
The atmosphere was adorable with fake palms trees, thatched hut and a waterfall
Service was adorable with bikinis and grass skirts
Food was actually pretty good, we thought the salmon was the best dish
The drinks were strong, but a bit too sweet
be careful with the prices of the volcano drinks, they can really add up
Went there for a birthday party a couple of nights ago
The atmosphere is really cool
Everyone liked the food
(Some of the drinks were really weak though
) The only thing that irked our party was the waitress
She was a bit too full of attitude
(I heard one guy actually say, I HATE her!) It would hurt to smile once
They have a really great drinks menu
They are mostly rum drinks and they come in those kitschy ceramic glasses with the tiki design
The food is very tasty and the night we were there they had live music
The music was a little loud but since we had finished eating it was OK
They do have a side room where I think it would have been quieter
I was disappointed in Waikiki Wallys
Our food was cold, the drinks incredibly weak, and the waitress didn't smile once
The only appealing thing about the place was the cockatoo
Never go to this place if you like to have something good to eat and drink
Cilantro Heaven! Do not waste your time on ordering if you hate cilantro as much as we did
It was in just about everything
Save yourself, your money and your friends the waste of an evening
I highly recommend Roy's Restaurant if you want something hawaiian
Who ever thought you could find something exotic in Manhattan? Once you walk in the door and the lei gets slipped over your neck, you've just crossed over into the tiki zone! Sit by the waterfall, chill to the sounds of Martin Denny and sip an exotic cocktail: from the tried-and-true kings like The Zombie, to Wally specials (they even have Virgin Sacrifices for the kids and designated drivers!) Served by a gorgeous waitress in a grass skirt! And the food's good too! Order up a flaming volcano bowl with three straws -- and three friends! Word of warning: don't drink one by yourself (like I did) I could barely finish it -- and I was in a tiki coma for the subway ride home (and boy did I have to pee later, but that's another story!) Complainers, boring people and the generally lame need not venture forth!
I took my boyfriend here on a Friday night after work
When we arrived I was a little nervous about the outside of the restaurant, but pleasantly surprised when we walked in
We were greeted by a waitress in a hula skirt and she proceeded to put leis around our necks
The atmosphere was very relaxing after a long week
I especially liked the live birds and the fountain
The food was good but I would have like more sauce with my appetizer! Drinks were great as was the service
Overall a very great experience and I would recommend it to anyone, but it was a little pricy
I threw a birthday party for my boyfriend at Waikiki Wally's on the advice of a coworker, and was not disappointed
The atmosphere is very fun and festive (I highly recommend going on Monday nights, when the Tiny Bubble Band performs), and the food was actually quite good, especially considering it's a theme restaurant
We ordered the set-menu for 13, and it was enough food
The staff and band were all very friendly and accommodating
The band even got my boyfriend up to sing the Tiny Bubble song, and then we got to hula dance! The only drawback is the relative lack of vegetarian options, a problem for some groups
Plus, I think it's a bit overpriced
But the evening was a whole lot of fun
So for a special occasion dinner that you won't soon forget, Waikiki Wally's is a good choice
My friends and I walked in on Saturday night
The place was packed but the host found us a table after about 20 minutes at the bar (excellent bartenders)
Pretty good considering our lack of reservation! The food was flavorfull and matched the ambiance
The staff looked great and was efficient enough
Overall do not expect a 3 star experience but a lot of fun for the money!
Best place for a birthday
Was taken by a group of stodgy doctors from New Jersey and the staff really encouraged them to let their hair down
One doctor danced with the waitress in a grass skirt, much to the displeasure of his spouse,
Food was delicious, as were the cocktails
Highly recommended for any festive event
According to restaurant legend, there WAS a Waikiki Wally, so maybe the food here was what did it to him
It was pretty bad, with a redeeming appetizer here and a vegetable side there
In spite of the huge bar scene, 9 bucks is an awful lot for a glass of ice and weak cocktails

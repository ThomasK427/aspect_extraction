Every Saturday from Sept-Nov Blondies turns into a little Columbus where all you see is scarlet and grey
I brought a friend of mine who doesnt really know what going to a big time football school is all about, and he was speechless, not to mention blind drunk
Pre game you will once again witness chants of O-H-I-O and listen to the fight song during halftime
And the wings!!! Some of the best in the city and tops on the UES
Sorry Back Page
Some of my best weekend afternoons in the city have taken place at Blondies, from what I can remember after all those pitchers
Call ahead and get thier early, you wont be dissapointed
I often come here to watch SEC college football games and it is never too crowded and the service is pretty decent
There are two floors, with the bar setting below and more tables above
The Blondie's buffalo chicken sandwich is among the best they have on the menu, reasonably priced at $8
The beer selection is limited, but also reasonably priced
The place is also quite clean for the fact they're in a rowdy neighborhood, in addition to their bathrooms
Will be coming back here again to drink and celebrate
We order from here all the time
Great food, clean restaurant, and prompt delivery
That's all I've had here, and it's about all they sell, but they're fantastic! (My boyfriend thought they were a little greasy though
but not enough to bother me) They're cheap and quick and delicious--a perfect snack!
I work in the area and wanted to love this place
But they only seem to get worse
They have possibly the worst service in New York I have waited until the waiter has finished his paper, begged for water and waited over an hour for my meal
You never know in what order your meal will arrive or if you'll get what you ordered
Most disappopining, their special chicken was undercooked and stale, and their French Fries greasy
What are people talking about? I think the service has gotten better here
We had a wonderful new waitress last Wednesday night, who was funny and attentive, and the food was good as usual
When it's not too crowded, this is a great spot to hang out with friends or have a relaxing evening
They're not nearly as expensive as Amsterdam Cafe right down the street, and the food is better too
We sat outside at the sidewalk cafe basking in what little sun we have had this spring enjoying our drink
We order a 25oz Frozen Margarita called the El Grande
This drink was as good as it size
We decided to get some appts as well to go along with the drink
We got the Shrimp Quesadilla and the fried Calamari both were excellent
Our service was good and our bill was under $30 before tip
Will be back!
We went last Tuesday nite to eat but got a pleasant surprise
We had the house special a half of rotisseree chicken with a mountain of real hand cut fries
As we were sitting a jazz band was setting up to play around 9PM
We did not know about the music and it was not advertised
The band started with my favorite Blue by Miles Davis
The band played to sets and finished around 11PM
We sat and enjoyed our meal without being rushed out
Our experience was nothing short of Perfecto
I would highly recommend it to anyone even if you do not live on the Upper West Side
I went with 8 friends for lunch after the commencement yesterday
It took them more than half an hour to get the appetizer out
Our food, just simply a few hamburgers and salad, was never come near our table after we had been waiting for almost an hour
Even though we were a party of 9, we seemed like transparent as we hardly got the waitress to our table
We got two set of extremely dirty forks and knives
We asked the waitress about our orders, but she told us that she was kicked out of the kitchen by the chef
The waitresses and I bet the kitchen staff, were out of control because of the crowded brought by the commencement
Finally, we left after waiting for more than an hour with an empty stomach and excessive dissatisfactions
WHAT a disappointment! We went back to Radio Perfecto last night for dinner after months of not going
The service was spacey (our appetizer order never made it to the kitchen), and the food was sub-par - greek salad with canned olives in it, linguine with shrimp so bland we had to add parmesan (usually a no-no with seafood pastas)
Even the sangria sucked, and we never got any water to wash it down with
Was there for lunch last week, and service was similarly spacey (getting a spoon AND sugar for a cappuccino took three requests of the waiter)
For the prices they are charging in a largely student neighborhood, the quality of food, and the service, ought to be higher
I think it's about time that there was a fun afforadable place to hang out uptown and I'm so glad that Radio Perfecto came along
My friends and I hang out there about once a week and we always have a great time
Sometimes there's live music (last Saturday night was great!) and there's always a fun bar crowd
I even took my parents out to dinner there (and they are hard to please) and we all had a great time, and the food was really good, too
Definitely recommended!
I RECENTLY MOVED INTO THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AREA AND WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THE NEW ADDITION OF RADIO PERFECTO
THE AMBIANCE IS PUB LIKE WITH A CHEERS LIKE QUALITY
STAFF WAS VERY FRIENDLY AND THE COSMO'S WERE QUITE REFRESHING
THE FOOD IS GREAT AND PRICED JUST RIGHT ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS
I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AND MOST LIKELY BECOME A CLIFF OR NORM REGULAR
CHEERS RADIO!!!!!!!!!!
While initially a strong culinary addition to the neighborhood, I experienced what was nothing short of miserable service there on a Saturday evening
All of this actually happened: There were no place settings (silverware, etc
) until after our meal was served, We were not given bread plates with our bread and olive oil, Drink orders were not brought until a second request, Meals were served to the wrong people at our table of four, A request for a dessert menu after the meal was ignored, We were never asked if the meal was okay
WHY HAVE SERVICE STAFF? Why didn't we just go to the bar and back to the kitchen and help ourselves? The dinner would have been far more enjoyable
In Short Set below the sidewalk, this restaurant and bar has high windows, a turquoise tiled bar and yellow and pink walls to let in the sunshine
Caribbean music and fruit-print plastic tablecloths further brighten the setting for Cuban plates
Ropa vieja and stuffed poblano chiles join picadillo Cubano, a beef hash flavored with raisins, olives and yucca, and garlic-and-lime marinated chicken breast, along with seviche, roasted corn, and the always-popular pressed Cuban sandwich
Do not book a dinner party at Cubana Cafe
I called the restaurant to set up a dinner for 20 people a week and a half in advance (contrary to the CitySearch profile they do take reservations) and asked if there would be any problems with a group that size or larger and people trickling in throughout the night if they wanted to have drinks
I was told that it was fine if we didn't mind being a little cramped
I called them a few days to confirm and again the day of and everything seemed fine
But when I arrived for dinner the manager suddenly demanded that I guarantee him that we spend a minimum
He also wanted it calculated on a per-head basis even though I had told people if they wanted to come later just for drinks that would be fine
Being asked to gurantee a minimum at the last minute was a shady move especially because I couldn't change my dinner party at the last minute
We met the minimum easily but the nature of the request was rude and added an unnecessary stress
I've done dinner parties like this at Sala years previous but decided I wanted a switch but I think I'll head back to Sala where they are super-friendly and helpful in setting up a dinner party for you and don't pull any stunts like this
Went there for dinner last night w/ my boyfriend and a friend after work and got there around 7 so we were able to score seats in this tiny cramped space
prices were reasonable but the portions were really small
I had the ropa vieja which was pretty bland, my boyfriend had the chicken breast w/ mango salsa which was ok but nothing special, and my friend had the chicken quesadillas which were tiny and plain
Dont think I would come back but at least their drinks were good
my friend and I went there last friday 3/31/06, we weren't sure where the place was but we finally found it
Is most cozy and lively place I have ever seen
The music is great and so is the service
I had the mesculin salad with avocados,mangos and fresh shrimps
Delicious! I would definitely go back
We just fell into this restaurant for dinner, and it was great
The food is authentic, inexpensive, and great
They have cheap cocktails ($6), and wine or sangria by the glass is $4
50
It is a bit cramped, but everything is great (especially the ropa vieja)
My wife discovered this little hidden treasure about a year ago
We've been there several times and I've taken clients for lunch a few times
It is great and the clients are always charmed and impressed
Service is good and very freindly

A clear-cut challenger to the Patois rendition available a few doors down on Smith
The worker bee waitstaff here are polite, sharp, and personable
The requisite apologies were delivered for our inordinate wait, along with token cocktails on the house
I prefer the inside dining room to the patio out back, which the other night seemed to contain many coed parties of recovering nerds in their early 30s
All were strangely overdressed, sat up too straight, and chose to communicate by murmuring, which lent a flat vibe in an area I'd otherwise expect to be a little more lively on a Saturday night
literally
Every item we oredered was burned, with the exception of my date's salad
But I'm sure they could have figured out a way to burn that too if they tried
The service was great but it didn't make up for the terrible food
The only thing I enjoyed was the wine
Not worth it - there are plenty of better places on Smith St
Dine out in Brooklyn Week Menu - $20
06 gave us an excuse to make reservations for Chestnut
I loved the beet salad with almonds and arugula
My pork chop stuffed with fig was delicious
Toni and I then ordered the Chocolate Budino with carmel drizzle
It was the best flourless chocolate cake on Smith Street
Believe me, we have trying them all for the last 5 years
We will be back!  michele
great food, great menu, great wine list
price fix on tuesdays and wednesdays can't be beat - it's the whole regular menu and a great price
we love this place and keep going back!
Everything here was lovely, but nothing blew me away except the desserts -- the hot chocolate here is *phenomenal*
Everything else was solidly done French-influenced New American Creative food
The appetizers were far more impressive than the main courses
(The flatbread was truly excellent, though the harissa could have used a touch less salt
) Wines were a bit on the pricey side, to match the menu
Recommend calling ahead on the weekends
the chef has recently changed at this place
i've had some fanstastic meals from the new menu
i was lucky to discover their prix fixe tuesdays a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed the best osso buco i've ever tasted
the chocolate budino is addictive
i went for brunch the first time this weekend and had lobster benedict
it was beautifully prepared
perfect meal to start off the new year
Chestnut is a wonderful additon to a neighborhood bustling with new restaurants and bars on a weekly basis
I stopped in at least 3 times a month and have a seat at the bar where I am always welcomed by smiling service and rich delicacies
The menu has changed since it open, seasonally I suppose, and one can expect to find specials often
I once had a duck soup in late February that was unsurpassed as a antidote to the city winter blues
Thank you for opening in my yuppie neighborhood- its quality and hey- who wants to see just another pretty face?
Had dinner here tonight
came in at 9:30pm or so, was seated with no reservations instantly
Nice, warm, clean room
our server was particularly excellent
had no problems with making some changes to the meals we asked for
made some good recommendations with the squid appetizer which was particularly excellent
The mixed drinks were ok
strong but not mixed well
The entrees were good but not great
I had the grilled shark which was cooked well but a tad too salty
Overall, dinner was good
excellent service, nice place
decent food
Wonderful and authentic cajun/creole food! The eggplant appetizer is a must
Enjoy
If this is good cajun then Teriyaki Boy is Nobu
Start with a dark cave-like space without air conditioning
Add slow and disinterested service
Oh, the prices are high as well
That should be enough right? Wrong! The food is absolutely awful
I am talking about off the shelf from dagastino's cajun food like Zatairan's etc
I mean this place shouldn't last more than, well it is June 13th as I right this and maybe they can make it until the end of the summer
although it will be tough without air conditioning
They need to pray for a new chef, new waitstaff and an early winter
Ugh!
My friend and I had an awful dining experience here
Apparently our order went unnoticed by the kitchen for over an hour as our slip fell on the ground
Our ditsy waitress failed to come check on us ONCE during this hour so we continued to wait unknowingly until we finally flagged down some other waiter
The food, once we received was decent but nothing special
Combine that with the blah decor and the AWFUL, spacey service and I definitely will not be back
There are so many better restaurants in Union Square
I don't predict this place will last long
Went to this place last weekend and the food is outstanding (if you like cajun)
The decor is kind of funky although the crowd is a tad sketchy
Don't go here if you're looking for trendy
Also, the servers are a bit spacy, but nice enough
Do go if you want to stuff yourself silly
Also, prices for NYC are a bargain w/dinner for two w/drinks still under $100
all i have to say is the food is wow! the staff could not be nicer
decent beer selection and fun n'awlins inspired drinks
and did i mention the food?
Went there because I had a gift cert
I am really amazed
The ambience is like a perfect place to bring a date or a long time friend to chat
They have a nice small bar
really friendly staff
great food
great tirimisu =)  I really enjoyed my experience and i would DEFINITELY recommend and go again
I agree that this is the perfect spot if you want to avoid the craziness of the traditional Park Avenue scene
Casual yet cozy, this restaurant has a varied menu with fair prices
The quality of the PEI mussels was excellent! The staff don't fuss too much and it's a good place to go for a quiet drink at the bar
Unlike the big, loud Chicago-style joints along Park Ave
S
, (like City Crab or Chango) Gamut is a warm, friendly neighborhood joint
Another contrast: not very expensive
The food is solid, though not exciting
A respite from the overblown scene joints in this area where you can actually talk to whoever you're dining with
This place is way cool
You can come here for a nice dinner - great food, atmosphere, nice staff - or hang by the bar especially after midnight as the place becomes a happening bar scene
This is my favorite spot to get together with old friends

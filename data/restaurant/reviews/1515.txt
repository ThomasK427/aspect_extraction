Its worth the price too
I highly recommend it!
This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken
The food is just fabulous - comfort food that has a twist of sophistication in presentation
For dinner, I love the churrasco and halibut with of course black beans and yellow rice
For brunch, the huevos rancheros are delicious
But the absolute best: cafe con leche (you can get it to-go, too) and arroz con leche (rice pudding)
The two cons: 1) can be along wait since the place is small, and 2) service isn't the friendliest
But the food definitely makes it all worth it
The pan seared red snapper was phenomenal! The dish was infused with many different flavors done
Hands down one of the best fish dishes that I have ever had in presentation and in taste
Also, it was all for $18
The service was a bit lackluster
The waiter barely refilled my water, but other than that I would highly recommend this restaurant
If you're looking for ambience, this is not the place to go since it is very small and resembles a luncheonette more than a restaurant
However, if you are willing to overlook those things, you will be in for a lovely culinary delight!
This is the best restaurant for Cuban food
I have no yet found a better one in NYC
The trip on the PATH train is worth it
The food is fresh and delicious
My favorite is the garlic grilled chicken; they give you a lot of food and the rice/beans is awesome
However, from the outside of the retaurant looks very run-down
La Isla fits the Don't judge a book by its cover
motto
This is one of my favorite restaurants
wish there was one like it in NYC
hmmm maybe I will open one up
:)
YUMMY!!!!! Pizza was VERY FRESH AND TASTY rather than canned and common!
I Always go there when I have a chance! Pizza is thin crust made with the freshest ingedients
Absolutely love it!
Great pizza - try the white pie! Nice thin crust
not too filling
It truly is the best pizza I've ever tasted
The ingrediants are as fresh as can be and the result is an amazing coal oven pizza
Sure beats any manhattan pizza
This used to be a classy one about 7-8 years ago
Now I feel like I'm eating microwaved Italian food
Hopefully mgmt can wake up and bring it back to what it used to be
When at this restaurant, stick to a pasta favorite
The chicken tasted remarkably like that which I would find at my local take out chinese place
Slightly peculiar
Skip the first chicken dish on the menu (with misspelled ingredient -butter-) and get lemon chicken at your favorite Panda Express Take Out
Bread was nice
Our waiter was absolutely unhelpful with helping us call a cab at the end of our visit
Crowded atmosphere
also fairly cold in the restaurant
Excellent bus boy!
Well, having traveled up and down Washington Street many times, I and my boyfriend have visited several Italian restaurants
One day, disheveled, cold and hungry, we finally went into Tutta Pasta
Although the somewhat posh-like marble, fountain, red and white decor was daunting, the food was delicious, the service leisurely but friendly, and the overall experience wonderful
It has become one of our favorite restaurants
I highly recommend the various tortellini dishes and the bruchetta
Tutta Pasta has a great location, but if you don't sit by the window it can lose its charm
I have only had the alfredo and pasta primavera and both were excellent but their service could definitely use improvement
The small chicken burritos are fabolous at this take-out place
The beans are delicious
But that is really all I would buy at this place
I ordered other burritos (w/cheese, sour cream, etc
) and enchiladas and they were just slop
Also be careful, they charge you extra for sauce, sour cream, salsa, etc
You can end up paying $5
00 just for condiments!
Great Mexican food and the Margueritas will put you on your a$$
Go there to pre-game a bar night, because their bar-front only seats like 5 people, there is no standing room, and they close early
Eat there, then go to Cadillac
I'm a sucker for romance so it's no surprise that I fell in love with Amanda's
It's a quaint, lovely and romantic place that serves delicious delicately prepared food
The prices are higher than the average place in hoboken but it's worth it
It's really a gem
This place has wonderful food and the best placed I have ever dined in all of NJ and I have been living here for 3 years! We go as often as we can and I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE! If you like to be waited on, fed delicious food and want an intimate dining experince this is the place for you!
attended a bridal shower at Amanda's on July 26,2003
Everything about the place was great
The staff went out of their way to make this occasion enjoyable for all involved
The food was delicious and every dish had a little something added to make it distinctive
The ladies at our table ordered the Grilled Hanger Steak on mixed baby greens and said that they did not know that flank steak could be so tender
The currants and pecans on the Sliced Grilled chicken breast on mixed greens were a savory addition
The celebration cake for dessert was moist and the frosting had just the right amount of sweetness
If I am ever in the area again I will plan on stopping in for dinner
It's OK if you are in the area
Not a smoke filled place which is rare for this area
So if you are in the area, it is OK
The decor is very pleasant
The mix-match charger plates are lovely, also a great way to save money and be chic
Very romantic, especially near the little garden
The appetizer and main course are good except the small portion
Lamb chop is recommended! Fish dishes are good
The dessert came as a disappointment though
Hot chocolate fudge cake and vanilla ice cream, the fudge cake was reheated in microwave making the cover kind of chewy
Overall recommend as a romantic dinner for two place
But order something else for dessert than the hot chocolate fudge cake vanilla ice cream
This place is great
I went there for my Anniversary and couldn't have picked a better spot
It is a really cute little spot to take a date or a loved one
Very romantic and the food and service were impecable
Pricey yes, but worth every cent
Amanda's was amazing
I have lived in Hoboken for almost 10 years and don't know what took me so long to try Amanda's
I went there for a bridal shower and the food was delicious
Service -- great

The service also is good
But sadly the food is terrible
My steak was so tough i couldn't eat it, which is even more annoying for the place
This place has the potential to be a great local, but not at these prices and certainly not when the food is at this level
HQ was recommended to me by a fried who had recently moved into the neighborhood
I stopped by a few days later for dinner and drinks
it was a week after their grand opening
The space is perfectly warm and intimate
Great for romantic dinners or small groups
The menu was superb and service attentive
This is what great new american cuisine is all about!
This recently opened Bistro in the heart of Soho is a diamond in the rough
The room is warm, exposed brick walls and rich leather banquettes, with a hint of modern elegance in the steel fans spinning overhead and wine glass chandelier  The cook's hits all the marks
Well prepared, fresh, american bistro cuisine presented in a stylish professional way without annoying downtown flair
Highly recommend the parsnip soup, scallop seviche, hangar steak and yellow fin tuna all delicious and fresh
The chef Terrence has been in the NYC restaurant trenches for years and gets the best product from his purveyors
Enjoy
I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting
But I've got to second the comment that the owner/manager has some issues handling customers and staff
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer
It could have been handled better
Made my dining experience uncomfortable
However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you
Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together
I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about- the service coudl not be friendlier and more welcoming, the radio and singing staff in teh background add to a friendly feel, there is table service at a place that you woudn't expect, the condiments are plenitful and the pastrami is AMAZING
we consider ourselves enough of foodies to not be exicted by just anyplace that calls itself new in brooklyn, and we have only had good experiences here
had a PLT (pastrami, lettuce and tomato)
even though they were out of rye bread, i had the marble and it was great
i also took home some chopped liver spread that was almost like my grandmas
this place isnt bad at all!
and that's saying a lot
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful
It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows
The food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs
I just ate at Mundo for the first time yesterday, and I have to say it was fantastic
The space is small but cozy, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable
There was some great music playing, which kind of made me feel like I was on vacation some place far away from Astoria
There are a lot of really great vegetarian options, as well as several authentic Turkish dishes
If you're still wasting time reading this review, stop now!, and head straight for Mundo! Your stomach could already be filled with tons of deliciousness!
After a long time searching for a place to eat on a Saturday night with my girlfriend, we decided to go to Mundo
The place is tiny and quaint, but very cozy with the soft candlelight and jazzy artwork adorning the walls
Our waiter was very informative and recommended a few items on the menu, which is seasonal
It was a warm summer evening which made the glasses of Sangria, abundant with slices of fruit, even more enjoyable
We had a crab and roasted red pepper dip along with a beef empinada for our appetizers, which set the tone of delicious worldly cuisine that we were about to experience
For our entrees, my girlfriend had the crabmeat burger with oregano seasoned french fries and I had tiny beef dumplings in a mildly spicy yogurt sauce topped with mint
Both items were absolutely delicious and not too filling, which allowed us to save room for dessert
We shared the pasha mundo, which rolls of cheese and almonds in a white creme sauce
Phenomenal!  Overall, Mundo was excellant from the service tight down to the food
The prices weren't too exhorbinant and it is an establishment that we would visit on a fairly regular basis
This place is hidden just off Broadway but not to be missed! I went with my girfriends on a Thursday night and it was great
There is something very calming about the restaurant and you feel it as soon as you walk in
The service was great and not once did we feel rushed, but at the same time not ignored
The waiter was friendly and made suggetsions on the menu
Although the menu is not that extensive, weverything we ordered was really tasty
I would highly recommend this place to anyone, its great to find different places in my neighborhood and take a break from the tried and tested
Finally
it open again
after long time close
and now its open again
Even thought the food is not the same like before, but still it has the best scenery to go
The bar is good, the food is okay, and everything is okay especially
its a place for us to hang out
but too bad its not good for kid
I am so excited that there is finally a trendy place in this area!!! The ambiance is great, the service couldn't have been better, and the food was delicious
LOVED IT HERE :)
Great ambience
Sitting in the bar infront of the flat screen tvs was awesome however the food was so so
I had a duck salad which was large and the sauce was good but nothing spectacular
I also ordered sushi and it was horrible
The rice was warm and didn't have a hint of vinegar
I would not recommend this place until they work out their kinks
finally a good sushi place near my apartment! and great prices too
Ive been there 3 times since it opened and ordered in once
Service in the restaurant is fantastic, the hostesses and waitresses are so nice and friendly
delivery was super fast and easy
and the sushi is delcious
chilean sea bass was amazing too
super!
The weekday buffet is wonderful as it is reasonable (although it went up to $8
95 as of 2/1/2006) and full of great options
First of all, the service is very acommodating and they are very helpful in making sure I've been taken care of
The buffet variety was great, some of the tastiest pakoras, palak paneer, excellent fresh naan, great fish curry as well and much more
The decor is clean, very pleasant as is the table arrangements
I felt like I was paying too little to eat at this place given the high quality service and lively atmosphere
But make no mistake, this won't be the last time I'll be there
took my girlfriend for valentine's day
was very excited to see the $14
95 prix fixe menu; a little leery when we walked in to find we were the only ones there
at least we couldn't complain about the service
the menu was confusing in that you're weren't entirely sure what you were getting, and what some of the items were

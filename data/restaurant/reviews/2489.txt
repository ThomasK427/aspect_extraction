With 30+ visits in last 4 years we've never been treated badly, never been rushed, never been dissapointed
Food is always generous, well-cooked, and satisfies that 3AM comfort food craving
The big burgers are soul-satifying, Buffulo Burger is almost healthy
Club sandwich is great
Tuna/chicken salad, good
Egg salad? Wonderful--one of the few places I order it
Soups are homemade and good
The fries are too good not to eat, unfortunately
Amibience-wise, it's brightly-lit and deco
Cleaner than your avg NY diner
Great people watching at lunch and late night--short story fodder for writers
Only annoyance is the ocassional noisy gathering of tragically hip UWS 20-somethings
A few order food, the rest just coffee, or nothing--even so, they're largely tolerated by management
the last two times i've been to city diner, the staff has been inexcusably rude
Once, on a weekday morning (restaurant virtually empty) I asked to be seated at a table rather than a booth
The snotty hostess rolled her eyes and said Noooooo like I was stupid
The next time I went, with a couple of friends, we were pushed out 15 minutes after our food arrived
They even took away my friend's salad before she was done! We had been there for literally less than 30 minutes, and though the busboys apologized profusely, they had been obviously told to rush us out
it was embarassing
I will never go there again, let alone take anyone there
Shame on you, City Diner
City Diner has come through for me in a drunken clutch time after time
They're a 24hour diner that delivers! I've only had their Burger Deluxe delivered, but the delivery guys are timely, and the food delicious and laden with fat (trust me; this is a GOOD thing at 4am)
I haven't actually been to the diner, and I actually don't intend to
But the delivery is impeccable
Enjoy!
This small romantic lil spot on the Upper West Side has been one of my favorite restaurants for years
Great Pizza as well as other classic Italian favorites
Not overpriced
Good Service
The tortellini daniella is the best! Great portions, great flavor
Truly authentic cuisine
Wait staff is courteous and knowledgeable
Good wine menu, and very good prices for midtown manhattan
Wait staff quickly brings foccacia bread to your table as soon as you sit down
The ambience is nice and it's an easy walk from the 1 train
The food was very, very good
The ambience was reasonably nice, though with paper tablecloths
However the hostess was at best unprofessional, talking incessantly and loudly on her cell, and seating people only when she couldn't avoid it while the one waiter was handling eight tables alone with a fair amount of effort
One cook was handling the kitchen
Again, if you can handle the agita, the as good as home-cooked by the ladies in the Italian neighborhood where I grew up food was excellent
uhhh
ok, so the last review was a bit irrelevant
Who would bring a 16 year old bday party to this romantic italian spot anyhow? So disregard the bitter soccer mom and read on
Coppola's is a warm cozy romantic spot or a spot for a small group of friends
The foccacia is served warm with mini olive oil decanters - to start
The place is filled with the aromas of the wood fired oven, very cozy
Service is non-intrusive and friendly
The penne is simple just how I like it
It really comes down to the sauce when determining the quality and Coppola's has the perfect blend of sweet fresh tomatoes
The chopped salad is the perfect start - to share
Could be a meal in itself
The minnestrone tastes like grandma's
That's all I got to say
We finished off with espresso and walked it off at the Whitney
I made a reservation for a party of 7, 24 hours in advance in person for my daughter's 16th birthday on a Saturday
When we arrived I had to approach the hostess for service
We were told the wait would only be 5 minutes
25 minutes later we were still waiting, no reason or apologies given by the hostess
Instead, 4 members of the wait staff were giggling and carrying on at the corner of the bar
Add insult to injury, a party of 8 had arrived about 10 minutes after us and were seated in 5 minutes
I asked the hostess why we had not been seated yet despite making a reservation so far in advance
Response: Well, too bad for you we are just too busy, so, you're just going to have to wait! With that, I gathered my group and walked out
The food was outstanding and affordable by any standard
What a wonderful ambiance which is quaint and charming
The staff was prompt and courteous
A true New York secret that needs to be told
Coppola's is a wonderful little Italian joint--I moved back to the west coast from NYC a couple of years ago and lament almost daily the absence of a Coppola's where I am now
It's the first restaurant I intend to visit on my upcoming vacation to NYC
Probably one of the best Italian meals I've had in the city (which as a relative newcomer I found strange that it wasn't even in Little Italy - maybe that's common?)
I went with a date and had a fantastic meal, in a great setting
And not expensive at all I thought
Definitely worth a visit
It's too good and I want to be able to get a table! I took my sister there with a friend and my boyfriend a few months ago
Every dish was wonderful, we had excellent service and the bill was so low that I thought they'd forgotten to bill us for things - like the bottle of wine
Simply great
YUM! everything we had from the bread to the appetizers to the meal itself was fantastic! the cheese was incredible, and everything was cooked perfectly
the space is a little cramped, but hey, its NYC
what do you expect? highly recommend!
I took a friend to this restaurant for a birthday celebration
The menu was quite comprehensive and the specials of the day added even more variety
The service was prompt, the wine selection was good, and the food was fantastic for the price! Overall I was highly impressed and plan to go back again soon!
La Vela is one our favorite UWS locales
The service is efficient and friendly
Their homemade pasta is amazing, especially the gnocci with gorgonzolla
Completely impressed with them every time
Great neighborhood place! Nice ambiance, great classic Italian dishes and a good value
They don't rush you out and you don't feel cramped - unlike a lot of the other small lower priced Italian restaurants on the UWS
I'll be back
This was great food and at an excellent value!!! The service was fantastic and it was a real homey place to eat
I will definitely be coming back!!!
When my boyfriend and I want to treat ourselves, taking a break from cooking and from our diets, we head to La Vela
The friendly staff, beautifully decorated dining room and delicious food combine to make this an outstanding eating experience
I have never once had any hint of any reason to not return again and again
Their food is fantastic, their drinks are generous, and their desserts
well if you have any room left over after their over-sized entrees, then you shouldn't pass them up
YUM!
I am addicted to this place
I go here almost three times a day
That's how good it is

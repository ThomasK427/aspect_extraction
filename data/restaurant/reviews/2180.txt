The service was good but that not why I go to a steakhouse
Try Ben Bensons or if you're really a meat fan, Churrascaria
Very Genorous Portions! The steaks were fantastic, the veggies very good
Excellent service
all around great experience!
i was a little disappointed w/ the steaks and the service
i wasn't aware that this was a place known mainly for its extensive wine list
i just wanted to visit and eat here b/c of the famous gambino killing
steaks were decent
service was ok
need to try pete luger's or smith/wollensky next time
This is one of the best steak restaurants in the city
The cavernous room may overwhelm some but the service, food and decor are outstanding
The steep prices are well worth eating this well
Reservations: Prompt
Service: Excellent
Food: None better anyware
Crowd: Cosmopolitan, epicurean
Dress: Whatever, Jeans to tux
Prepared as requested with ample portions
Price: commensurate with service and food
Looking forward to going again
I travel quite often
While away i try many of the better restaurants around the world
I will venture to say that sparks is one of my favorites! It brings me back to New York time and time again
My first visit being of the best
We were a group of 10 and the service was still top notch
Probably the best fillet i have ever eaten, prepared to perfection
The cold asparagus salad was to die for
Fantastic service atmosphere, and above all, food!!
My filet mignon tasted more like rump roast and the service was obnoxious and slow
This place has no clue
Opt for the Strip House, Old Homestead, Peter Lugars, or Dylan Prime
I could not believe that a steak house did not have Porter House Steak
We expected much better food and better service
The food was nothing out of the ordinary and the service was very lacking
The waiter was cold, rude and unfriendly
He served our desserts and after-dinner drinks and threw the bill on the table along with it eventhough we had not asked for it
We then ordered coffees he had the nerve to coldly ask 'You don't want the bill'? We (four of us)spent $450 for an experience we won't be repeating
We will not be visiting SPARKS again!
Since we had a reservation, I did not need to wait for long, but everything was ordinal
The Spark's original steak sauce is worth trying, but meal itself is just OK
This place makes Outback a better alternative unless your company's expense account lets you dine with someone else's money
I went with a group so the waiting was not too bad
I do not recommend for lunch due to the wait
The food was excellent when it finally arrived
One of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have had in a while
Perhaps it was the 1 1/2 hour wait on a weeknight with reservations
Perhaps it was all the cigar smoke from folks who looked like central casting could use them on the Sopranos
The mediocre, wildly overpriced food in a dining room that looked like a basement surely did not help
Even Outback's is better than this place
None better when it comes to steakhouses
The service is great, the food is great, and the setting is great
what more can you ask for?? It is a bit pricey, but you pay for what you get
For all of you Peter Luger's lovers, well, this place makes Luger's look like the Outback Steakhouse
In my estimation, the steak and the service can't get any better but you must bring your wallet w/you in order to enjoy this establishment
Service seriously lacking
I eat out alot, and was floored by how unattentive and unprofessional the service was at a place the I thought mastered the craft years and years ago? What suprised me the most, was that after ordering a $325 bottle of vino (I wasn't paying) the service STILL stunk
I guess Sparks will continue to draw crowds due to its name (and the steak was quality) but the poor wait-staff won't get me back anytime soon
Well, if it is than the mob knows best
On a recent visit to New York, both my dad and I ordered the filet mignon
The filet was awesome, the wine was great, the ambiance was what it should be!
The only thing worse than the improperly cooked steaks was the non-existant service
Once a great steakhouse, now a schlockhouse
Take this one off your list!
Over the years Sparks has been one of my top dining picks
No Longer! Sparks has sunk to mediocrity
Service is non existent
Water was unattainable
In desperation my diner guest went to the side stand retrieved a pitcher of water and served herself
My martini glass remained on the table throughout wine and diner
Steaks ordered med-rare and medium were served blood rare
When the waiter ultimately was located (no easy task) the requested medium steak was returned to the kitchen
It arrived from the kitchen rare
She surrendered, ate the tips of the sirloin and left hungry
Paul Castellano the mob figure slain some years ago at Sparks entrance would have been better off had he dined at Palm west as we did the next evening
Mr
Castellano would have experienced an excellent steak, excellent service, and who knows may be alive today to talk about the experience
I have never had a steak this delicious before in my life! The cut was perfect and tender
The wine list is unbelieveably extensive and quite reasonably priced
The service is awesome
they see to it that not one customer goes unattended in any way
Expect the bill to be a little high - but it's WORTH it!
Undoubtedly, NYC's largest, most thriving and most bustling steakhouse
Huge! Became famous because a Mafia leader was killed on its doorstep some years ago
Service is professional but totally colorless, service at the bar a bit better
Steaks are certainly not prime quality, though their price is
Not my favorite by any means
A friend of mine couldn't stop talking about this place, and I just had to try it
I went here for lunch the other day, and I was pleasantly surprised! It was really busy, but we were seated promptly
The server was really nice, and was VERY helpful in our orders
When we looked at the menu, we couldn't believe the prices! For sushi (at lunchtime), I thought it was really cheap, and it was so hard to decide since there were a variety of options! My friends and I absolutely loved their dishes, and when the bill came, we felt like we were ripping THEM off! I definitely recommend to come here for lunch if you're in the mood for sushi and don't want to spend too much money
If you're like me, you'd be going to as a regular esp on their special nites, Mon, Tues, and Thurs where prices are slashed and quality is not compromised
Yes, it's very crowded and popular thus, you will have to wait at a table after 6:30pm-8pm
The staff is very busy, but I'll never had a problem getting my food within a reasonable time, and they are very attentive with filling your tea
This is one of the best restaurants in the midtown east/UN area
Since renovating the interior, this East location has become very crowded during weekday lunches and most days for dinner as well
I live locally and know when to eat in to avoid the crowds, but I would caution anybody else to avoid the place whenever it looks crowded
The service is pretty bad when it's crowded and the manager is rude
I wouldn't be surprised if the service is bad because good help won't work for the manager at this location, but who knows? I do know that this place is pretty good across the board in terms of the food and is a good value, especially on a specials-nite

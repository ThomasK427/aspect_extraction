soon i will try on the lunch buffet they have
As a cook that formerly worked in an Indian restaurant , I know a thing or two about the cuisine
BLCH is a disaster with terrible food service
Ate there with four friends and all had the same reaction
Now the details
We started our evening with a Tandoori Sizzler ($20
00)
A few pieces of over cooked meat on bed of tasteless vegetables
Prawn Balchao- Not bad, but still not impressive
The Goat Bhuna had 0 meat and all bone
Lamb Biryani- A Classic- This tasted like Rice a Roni cooked with  Cardamoms in a masala dark mud sauce
Goa Chicken did have a better taste but the chicken was so over cooked I thought I was eating beach thongs
Phaal- No balance in the spice blend, just mirchi, ginger in a tomato goo
Folks save your money
It is over priced and not worth the $200 we spent
I have been to Bricklane twice and both times have been great
The staff was very attentive and the food is out of this world
If you have any questions about any of the dishes, the staff is knowledgeable and can answer any questions or give recommendations
This place has got to be the best Indian food in New York
The ambience is inside is great for a group of friends or for a date
Definitely recommended
Started my meal with the Shammi Kabob Appetizer
It's some best I've ever had
They come out on a steaming iron skillet
Taste so fresh and bursting with spice
My companion had the Goan Curry, very unique tasting
The corrinder and vinegar come alive in cococunut milk
I like to test my love of spice, so I got the Phaal Curry
It comes with a verbal warning, and if you finish it you will get a free beer (every last drop of the meat and masala)
But its ridiculously hot, I ate all my meat, couldn't eat all the masala (even with raita and bread)
The extreme spice definetely takes away from the flavor of the dish
Its is a dark brown curry
ONLY FOR THE SICKO SPICE PEOPLE TRUST ME
Our waitress, Jade, was very pleasant and knowledgeable
They also do a bunch of Chai Cocktails which looked interesting
Who is writing these rave reviews about this place ? I have been to bricklane twice and both times was left utterly disappointed, from flat beer to bad desserts, they seem to have no kind of control over the food, both times the food tasted different and spicy
I wouldnt go to this place ever again, the other cheaper resteraunts are much better
I'm a big fan of Indian food but I'll not return to Brick Lane
The service and ambience were very nice
It's nicely decorated and has good music (not particularly Indian, however)
Unfortunately, the food did not measure up
I had lamb vindaloo which was VERY spicy and that's ok but the meat wasn't properly cooked
It was tough and tasteless
Any of the restaurants on Lex between 25th and 30th are far superior
They don't have the ambience but if it's good food you want, don't go to Brick Lane
Even the beer was flat
By Far the Best Curry in the City
The only place doing justice to Indian Food
I was very excited to find an authentic english curry house in curry row in the east village
The food was a little spicy which was exciting as other resteraunts tend to spice it down to american levels
Food by far the best Ive eaten outside of England
Hope they open one up on the UWS
I love to try new rest
but this place seems to lack in everything! The service was soo slooww
Once we were seated, it took a long time before we got our menu and at that time, it wasn't even at their peak hours! I wonder why all the craze for this place and about their food
The flavor were bland and there were nothing that seems to excite my taste buds! Worst of it, me and my friends were very dissapointed because it wasn't what we expected and we were totally ignored when we wanted refills for water
I would never recommend coming to this place ever again! There are lot's of other good indian food in other place but definitely not here!
i have been looking for the good old BUTTER CHICKEN from MOTI MAHAL in delhi, but? These guys have everything upto my expectations, but they should add BUTTER CHICKEN, Chicken Tikka Masala is OK, but BUTTER CHICKEN is the real thing
I'll be back hope they have it on the menu when i go back
Everything else was outstanding
I've enjoyed very good curries at Dawat and Chola, and more recently at Banjara, and I've also tried many of the other 6th street and thirtieth street curry houses
BUT, until I ate at Brick lane for the first time last year, Ihad never found an Indian resturant that consistantly combined the full flavor, heat, textures and freshness that make for great Indian food
Brick Lane is simply the best Indian food I've had in this town!  One dish that I particularly like to share as a starter (although it its in the entree section of the menu) is the outstanding pudeena paneer which is grilled chunks of paneer cheese placed on sizzling, white wine-marinated onions, red peppers and cauliflower
Simple and delicious
This resteraunt certainly seems to be on its way up, I was here 2 years ago when the place was small, but now a bigger better location
Fortunately the food hasent changed and is still some of the finest Indian I have ever sampled
This place certainly is doing things right
Will definately come here again
Brick Lane is exceptional, head and shoulders above all those other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood
The menu is varied and I have yet to eat something there that I didn't love
Service was excellent and there is a fun and relaxed atmosphere
A great value for your money
This restaurant is a relief from the usual throng on 6th Street for those looking for more than a cheap dodgy curry
The bar is spacious and well suited for pre or post dinner drinks, the place is clean and the food is excellent
The service can vary although overall its been fine on my last couple of trips
Hopefully this will continue to improve and not distract from an otherwise excellent dining experience
I've eaten here twice in recent months
The first time I called in a to-go order
They said it'd be ready in 20 minutes, and sure enough, it was
A few weeks after that I made the mistake of eating a meal in the restaurant
The comments everyone else has made are pretty accurate: it took nearly an hour for the entrees to arrive after we'd eaten our appetizers, and we certainly didn't get an apology for the delay
I highly recommend the food, which is some of the best I've encountered outside of the real Brick Lane in London, where I used to live
Get it takeout, however
The food was so tasty, the service was great, and every person we encountered was pleasant and fast
The ambience was very cool with colanders as wall lamp shades and neat lanters from the ceilings
Each dish was more than plenty and so good we tried to finish what we ordered, but ate until we were too full
I regret not having room for gulab jamin
Another time
Definitely would come back
Love the name too!
This Indian restaurant is a cut above the other 6th street establishments
Each of the dishes we had were great, but personal faves were the toor daal, chicken makhni and the naans
It's not for people with sensitive stomachs, but if you like spice and not all your dishes to taste the same, go here!
Who's writing these reviews? The service was the worst -- I waited 15 min before my dinner arrived even though my companion was already finished eating
I just moved here from London and its a disgrace to call this place an Indian Restaurant
The curry's were muddy, the appetizers greasy and cold
and the prices were expensive
SKIP IT!
I eat out very often, but this place is by far the best i've been to in years
The food, the people,

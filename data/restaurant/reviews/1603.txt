The fireplace was a nice touch, and the patrons were all lounging and chatting but it wasn't noisy
I had a terrific experience here with this ambience
Couples only
A charming tiny restaurant with delicious food! Came here for brunch and everything ordered was fantastic
But we were especially impressed by the attentive service
The wait for brunch is kinda long (what can you say? The place is popular)
But the waiter noticed how long we were waiting and let our four-person party sit at a two-person table and order drinks and our meal while we waited
Very generous for a tiny space
I'm definitely going back for seconds!
Only good things to say about this place
Everything was wonderful, and we were impressed by the server's ability to handle the entire room so efficiently
The place is tiny, so try to make a reservation
Had the blackened catfish, which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned
Very reasonable prices, large portions
Don't miss out on the fruit crisps
In Short Secreted away in a small site in the heart of the Saint Mark's Place chaos, Khyber Pass is surprisingly peaceful and romantic: a dark, smallish room walled with brick and decorated with elaborate fabrics
The menu features halal meat, and offers a selection of Afghan favorites: charcoal-grilled kebabs of filet mignon, ground beef, or Cornish game hen; sauteed pumpkin; housemade noodles in yogurt sauce; and a number of spicy meat sautes, as well as plenty of vegetarian options
I have been to this restaurant maybe 4-5 times with both parents and friends and it was excellent every single time
I have been there twice
The second time service was a bit slower, and less attentive (supposedly an Afghan celeb was getting all the attention at the table in back of me)
But it has a nice, romantic, and afghan ambient to it
I have also been to Bamiyan afterwards, and found the setting there to be a little bit more exotic and romantic, but however, perferred the food and porportion-price deal at Khyber pass
I went there the other night on a date, and the food to put it simply was amazing! The portions were big enough for one, and big enough for the price ($10-$15 for an entree)
The restaurant is decorated beautifully, you have to check out the ceiling and the chandeliers! The service though was horrible
After being seated for a half hour with our menus closed, my date had to get up to get a waiter
He then had to get up to get the check also
It was the worst service I have ever had, and there were only 2 other couples in the entire place!
I also had apps the first time I went there and the best was the pumpkin filled fried dough things
They came with a great slightly sour sauce (yogurt and spices?) and it was SO good
The lassa like cardamom drink is great too
There is a beautiful little window seat with a low table and some cushions
SO romantic
If you're looking for something that's a fusion of middle eastern and indian, then you'll be very pleased with Afghani food
Khyber Pass is extremely inconsistant in terms of the quality of the food and the service is always slow
I'd recommend getting a number of appetizers and a single main dish so you can get a range of flavors
A pot of spiced tea is a must
This is one of my favorites, and it's the restaurant I always take my out-of-town friends to when they come to visit for one night - the St
Marks atmosphere to give them a little culture, and Khyber Pass for the great food and delightful ambience
Great restaurant for a cheap-but-not-sleazy first date too
My fiancee and I had a very nice meal here - unusual food (pumpkin) but very tasty
The atmosphere was very warm and homey for a cold winter evening, and the service, while not spectacular, was fine
Definitely a nice place to go for a relaxed, cozy atmosphere and a slightly-more-exotic than normal menu
DING DONG - great experience, service slightly inattentive and slow, but go it's good
YUM! This place is quaint and the food is yummie and interesting
Service is a tad slow
well more than a tad
But overall a definitely good meal
don't compare this restaurant to the indian dives around st marks--this place has a beautiful interior and delicious food
the best afghan food i've had in the city (and you might be surprised at the number of other afghani restaurants)
the food has a lot yogurt in it, but its all very savory and delicious
i had a chicken curry dish and my boyfriend had the pumpkin dish, both of which were wonderful
the prices were quite reasonable
I'm not adventurous when it comes to food, but my bf convinced me to try this place
I was happy that he did
Once you walk into this place, it's like you're not at St Marks anymore
It's cozy, and private, clean and pleasant
Definately recommended!
If you're sick of the East Village Indian dives, check out this variation on similar spices, but done to another culture's specifications
Best of all, they've got a bar, so no need to BYOB
I was unimpressed with Hasaki on several different levels
Although we were seated immediately, our waiter was practically non-existant
We constantly had to flag him down, even to place our order
More importantly, the sushi itself was substandard
I've eaten at Hasaki many times and the food and service are always excellent
Last night, the seatrout appetizer was fantastic! Fatty and gelatinous and creamy
We enjoyed the sushi/sashimi special for two
The salmon, tuna and yellowtail were sparking fresh
Like butter! The tuna in the spicy tuna roll was as fresh as could be and the California roll had real crabmeat, not surimi
We had toro and uni for desert(!) and they were the best ever
Im very fussy about where I eat uni! The service was solicitous and attentive, as always
the house sake is very nice at a reasonable price
The only drawback? Hasaki is so popular there's often a long wait
Highly recommended!
Patroned at this establishment for 4 plus years
Never have I been treated the way I was last night
Last night they gave me the WORST cut of fish I've ever seen in my sashimi/sushi combo priced at 20
00! When I complained, I was told that We cannot give you any other fish
Basically I was being asked to pay a lot of money for cuts of fish that would have been trash elsewhere! I've never been so appalled in my life, by the way, that quote was from the manager
He never offered an alternative dish, service or anything
Apparently, bad cuts, bad portion size and good customer service means nothing to these people anymore--I left and went two doors down to another sushi place, where for 1
50 less, the cuts and portions we're amazing and presentation was flawless
Hands down, Hasaki, is one of my favorite restuarants in NYC
The sushi is always fresh and succulent, if I am feeling the need for something cooked, the slamon teriyaki is slammin'
The restaurant is clean, the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious, the servers take very good care of you and the food is consistently DELICIOUS!!! Another bonus is the affordability
This restaurant has been the neighborhood for many years and should stay forever more
Been a fan of Hasaki for many years
They offer consistently good food
Sushi is fresh and tempura is perfectly fired but light
I used to like the Japanese Steak when it was served in a hot metal plate
It doesn't taste as good when they changed it to a regular plate
Servings are small but it is not too pricey
If you have a small crowd and don't mind the wait, you can't go wrong with this place
The sushi was pretty good quality
They didn't offer too much variety and did not make any rolls that were not on the menu
Service was a bit slow
Usually there's a wait but it's a nice area to walk around in
This is one of my favorite japanese restaurants in new york
With so many restaurants to choose from in the city, this is the only one that I come to regularly
The sushi is so fresh and tasty! I've also tried their tempura which is perfectly prepared, and even something as simple as the salad is delicious here
Be aware their portions are a little small but it will allow you to savor every bite

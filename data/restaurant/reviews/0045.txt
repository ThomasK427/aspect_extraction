The service is casual and skillful; servers are able to discuss the restaurant's well-chosen wines and beers at length
The Food  Raga does a brilliant job with Indian fusion dishes as simple as vegetable curry or as ambitious as pan-roasted lamb sirloin with cranberry beans and nigella ragout
Nigella seeds also scent the otherwise conventional roasted potatoes, which typifies the restaurant's inventive, yet solid, approach
Across the menu, and even within a single dish, there is a stunning variety of scintillating, distinct flavors
Mussels in deeply aromatic lemongrass broth make an excellent starter, as do the light and spicy house samosas
Keep an eye out for safari-esque specials featuring wild boar, alligator and the like
Raga is perfect in everyway! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant on a lazy Sunday evening and I am so glad we did!
Raga is a cozy little place, with great music and the staff couldnt be nicer
However the real standout is the food ! We took our waiters suggestions to order the wild boar with coconut rice and the lamb chops
WOW! They were both amazing
The way the Indian and French styles meld together is perfect
The meat was sooo tender and tasty, best lamb I have ever had in any restaurant by far
The Indian spices give everything a unique and tantalizing flavor
Try the Naan bread with mango chutney
Give Raga a try you wont be disappointed
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent
The filet mignon dish was superb! I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
It's a small cute restaurant
Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
It is also extremely well priced
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
We love eating here for the comfortable yet creative atmosphere, the scrumptious fare, and friendly staff
We haven't been disappointed yet
We'll be back!
From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning
Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service
Prices are not cheap, but not expensive but the meal is worth every penny
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests
Be sure to reserve in advance!
Food was Awesome! Lamont is truly a gracious as a host should be
Food was plentiful and reasonably priced
Definitely go and try the inventive fare!
My partner and I ventured down on the hint that there would be a wild boar dish available for a limited time
The Wild Boar in Curry was delicous as was the lamb
desert, a chocolate soufle, was incredible
The ambiance was nice, a low-key hip place
The service was adequate
very nice servers, but they seemed more interested in conversing with the regulars than bringing food and being attentive
My wife I have visited Raga more than 15 times in the last few years
Anymore and we'd get too used to the food
A few things about the menu that are worth mentioning: 1
Attention to detail in the ingredients, always cut to the right size so as to blend the flavor with the tastes of spices pefectly in your mouth
2
Consistency: Everytime I visit, the taste is exactly the way I remeber it (which is difficult to do) 3
Variety of flavors among all the entree's are excellent, which means you get to tantalize the tongue in more than one direction in a night
Overall, I'd describe the food as orally orgasmic
Rack of lamb, mahi-mahi, grilled salmon, blah-blah
The usual boring American dishes, with a few unimaginative spices, packaged as Indian-influenced for those who can't handle anything too new or different
I wasn't expecting Indian, but I was expecting adventurous, original or surprising
The only thing adventurous is all the Indian silver jewelry on the maitre-d
The Scene The main dining room of this boisterous Carnegie Hall restaurant, dubbed the New York Room, is a cavernous space with high ceilings and sweeping glass windows
Columns painted by students from the New York Academy of Arts depict New York street scenes
The Food With nearly 80 selections to choose from, the menu takes time to digest
Among appetizers, shrimp and smoked fish selection score highly
First-rate entrees include red snapper baked in a clay pot with tomatoes and black olives
Meat eaters can indulge in everything from steaks and wiener schnitzel to roast duckling
The brief list of desserts includes a rich chocolate marquise and a lemony banana-cream pie
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table
Service here was great, food was fantastic
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared
Will absolutely visit again
Maybe tomorrow ;-)
A friend of mine brought me here
I loved it
I brought a friend of mine here
She loved it
We brought a bunch of friends here
They loved it
The Cobb Salad is to die for
The service is friendly
The place may be a bit on the loud and bustling side, but that's part of its charm! Try it
You'll love it!
Big and gawky on the outside
Tends to turn people away
Go inside and you won't want to leave
The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants
Nice find
In fact, you can't miss it
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody
The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great
They also do a great job for restaurant week
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad

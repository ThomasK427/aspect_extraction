If this wasn't bad enough, in a loud tone that was meant to be overheard, he yelled at whoever was responsible for cleaining our table and told them to clear away out plates and bring out our dessert
As if we wanted to stay there any longer
I would NEVER go back and do my best to advise other people not to support this type of service or treatment
Been there three times and have basically tried most of the items on the menu
My girlfriend and I have not been disappointed! Make sure to ask the waiters about the dishes
They are very attentive and willing to explain
The mixed drinks are good and the appetizers are our favorite
Highly recommand the lamb chop and the prawn entree - both were marinated just right with either curry and tandoori sauce
The desserts were also good
Try the 3 creams
The ambience is great - nice and modern indian style with great lighting
One thing to take notice - almost every dish is spicy!  going back again soon!
When I went, I had the vegetarian tasting menu
Some of the entrees had what I thought were inventive and unusual spice combinations and presentations, especially for North Indian food, which often tends to encompass the same old dishes from restaurant to restaurant
I especially liked the ice cream, which was a kulfi wafting in some kind of tangy sweet water
Overall, though, nothing stuck out in my memory as being particularly delicious or a reason to crave a return to the restaurant
The 6 of us ordered 12 dishes, and nothing was exceptional
Lamb stuffed chicken ($12 - 3 small pieces of chicken), Manchurian cauliflower (tastes like kung pao
cauliflower!), Bombay Bhel Puri (a tiny pyramid with just a few morsels of Bhel Puri)
Even as an appetizer, I can't get over the size of the dishes
I'm not particularly impressed by the taste either at this point- there seems to a total lack of the fresh flavor that defines good Northern Indian food
At $21, my turkey keema arrives with no rice or nan
So I separately order the $6 bowl of basmati rice, which is three tablespoons of rice!! I finally just want to scream in disbelief when the kulfi arrives and is smaller than a tablespoon
After paying $100, we walk out still hungry and head for slices of pizza
I've never left a restaurant feeling more ripped off
I'm not sure what the other reviewers are complaining about but they must think excellent Indian food exists on 6th street
That works well if you want to have cheap and heavy Indian food
Devi on the other hand is an eclectic twist on the everyday Indian cusine with an incredible rajasthani influenced decor
I do recommend you make reservations and go with an appetite
The services is incredible and extremly attentive to the patron, just as one would find in any 5 star restaurant in India
The mango chesse cake is an excellent desert to top off the night
Seven for dinner, and everyone regretted it
We did NOT find any delight or even pleasure in any of the 10 dishes that we ordered (a consensus)
At best, the preparations were mediocre the diners on Lexington Avenue serve more flavorful dishes
The single tiny fritter placed at the beginning of the dinner with great ceremony was oily and chewy
Be it tarka dal (watery and missing the earthy roasted cumin seeds), assorted vegetables (bland as if from freezer to steamer), chicken makhani (pedestrian sauce), lamb with spinach (over-spiced with black peppers), the uniform feeling was that of disappointment
The pooris were miniscule, about 2 bites each; they serve 4 of those as a dinner for $25! The portions are ridiculously small, especially at these prices
The service is fawning and irritatingly patronizing, as if it was a rare privilege for us
None of us will go back
Heard very good things about this restaurant before going, but was quite disappointed
We ordered a number of dishes for our table and the food ranged from good to mediocre, with nothing really standing out
Many of the dishes were cold coming to the table and some were greatly oversalted
Spicing was suprisingly tame (except for the salt!) and not very complex
For these prices, and these are serious prices, I would have expected much better
The cocktails were quite good though and no complaints about the service except that they subtly try to up the tab by pushing more dishes than you need
I have been surrounded with Indian food my entire life, and my lunch time experience at Devi was absolute bliss
For about $20 I got a 3 course meal and a lovely very unusual lemonade which was just the right portion size
This meal began with a perfectly crisp crab cake with a sort of curry drizzled over it
then proceeded with the tandoori halibut with briyani rice and this delicious mint/celantro chutney
the dessert was like NOTHING I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant
It was a kulfi ice cream with crystalized sugar, rose water, and nuts
I live in Los Angeles, but whenever I visit NYC there is one thing on my mind: Lunch time at Devi
We had the tasting menu, and nothing was truly out of this world
I've had much better indian food elsewhere
The lamb chops, although parts were tasty was mostly full of rubber, which was a real shame
The chicken stuffed with lamb tasted was overdone
Halibut was decent
Dessert was good
Mushroom appetizers were good
Note that the 7 courses add up to a LOT of food - you need a huge appetite to do it justice
Also, the service was pretty slow
Good food but not inexpensive
The restaurant is small so ask for seating in the front upstairs (the back, where we were sitting was incredibly hot) or on the first floor
The service was good not great, and it should be for the price

Very disappointed
We had a dinner party of 20 there in the balcony seating area
It was so uncomfortably hot - their heating system apparently had been broken down for at least a week
We had the 4 course meal, and the portions were too small
The tastes and presentation of the dishes were interesting but not worth the price
My Indian colleagues would agree
I would advise not having a group event there - the event planning on Devi's behalf is not up to snuff (and not up to their word)
Everything tastes fresh, unique, well spiced
It's one of the few restaurants that seem to pride themselves on the food, service and it's a joy
We are picky, food snobs, and we were impressed
Supposedly homestyle Indian, but whether its like what they make in India or not, its great and unusual food
I ate veal brain (at my date's insistence) and liver bruschetta that was tasty
Spicy prawns for an entree were the size of your head (ok maybe more like a lobster tail), along with some good although more standard saag paneer
Lamb stuffed tandoori chicken, excellent appetizer
Service was solicitous, we had 3 guys pouring wine and serving us constantly, only cons were that they somehow ran out of 2 of their speciality cocktails (don't know how you run out of a cocktail) but the drink list was unusual with a south asian flavor influence (saffron infused drinks, fresh fruit, ginger etc)
meal was a little pricey
the bill was about $200 but that included a $55 dollar bottle of wine
ranks up there with Tamarind and Tabla as far as unusual Indian food
Maybe because it is restaurant week, but service was very poor and the food okay
I saw alot of hype, with no reason
Caveat: our meal was $20 for restaurant week, so I imagine the food is typically overpriced
Decor was lovely, service attentive (waiter seemed to love working there), and food managed to be authentically Indian yet uniquely flavorful
The desserts, especially the kulfi, blew my mind (I usually find kulfi to be quite mundane, but here the saffron and citrus sauce were absolutely sublime)
I liked it far more than Tamarind
Should be a great date spot
To not L-O-V-E this restaurant! Everything from the prompt attentive service to the last morsel of mango cheesecake on my fork left a resounding impression of perfection and sumptuous Indian food
My entire 5 person group fell in love with the food
There was something for everyone to devour
Even my wonderful yet eccentrically pretentious friend said he was glad he flew from Seattle to enjoy this amazing treat
If and when you make the choice to give this gem a try, I recommend you set aside all expectations and allow yourself to be amazed!
Like dining in an Indian palace
Takes service too an elegant extreme
Food is spectacular

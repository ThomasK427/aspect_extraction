Coffee was brought to us after the check!   It didn't help that we had two new-money early 30-something girls talking about how unhappy they are with their 5 carat rings (no joke!) and their water breaking in Bergdorf's
Tables are too close for that type of discussion
And they were LOUD
I went to JoJo on a Friday night around 8pm without any reservation
My friend and I passed by the quaint restaurant front and decided to give it a try
We were seated immediately without any wait, service was impeccable and the dining room romantic
The two of us sat in privacy with our table located on one side of the dimly lit narrow 2nd flr dining room
The food was good but you could probably get more bang for your dollar somewhere else
I did enjoy the whole dining experience though, tasty food, wine and great ambience
My dish, venison was delicious but still, not out-of-this-world
If you wanna splurge a little go for the ambience - you'll leave with a satisfied stomach and happy tastebuds
My friend thought his food was fantastic
For a three star restaurant, it delivered good food and diner-style service! Below expectaion
The food was great, but not outstanding
I had the chicken, and it was a little dry, but the steak my husband had was delicious
The appetizers were the stars of the night--squash soup that will blow your socks off, and goatcheese fondue that you just want to keep eating and eating
The goatcheese paired with beets was fantastic
My complain was the noise--high decibels, cramped surroudings, below average service
Overall, for best experience go late at night, after 9:30 pm when the crowd is gone and staff can pay more attention
To compare it with Cafe Boulud, which is a restaurant of same caliber and associated with a celebrety chef, Cafe Boulud will get my return business
Not worth the money or the ridiculous wait
We had to wait 45 minutes for our table because they claim we didn't confirm our reservations -- whatever -- we confirmed that morning
The bartender made a great french martini though while we waited, as I got a dozen dirty stares from the overage snotty crowd in the broom closet size front bar
The food was good but nothing to brag about
I was expecting more from Jean George
The service was horrible! Our waiter handed us the dessert menu before we even got our main course -- hello?!  The restaurant itself was very elegant, but I wouldn't go back again
My family and I had dinner at Jo Jo last night and we all thought that the food was excellent
I had the salmon with mashed potatoes and a truffle vinagrette and a goat cheese tart
These dishes were both very flavorful and cooked to the salmon was cooked to perfection! Not fishy at all
The wine list was very affordable with nice selections and the desserts were all fabulous
The chocolate cake was especially good
The atmosphere was also very nice and the service was good, but this is not a restaurant where you have a quick meal
The food was eclectic and delicious, the service was perfect because you never noticed the waiters, the setting was dark and cozy
A great date place if you have the $$ to spare
The ambiance at dinner was fabulous
You can go semi-cas or elegant
Yes, the tables are small, but realize that's part of the charm
If you want a cavernous restaurant, pay big at Le Cirque
The food is affordable considering it's fine dining in NYC--and it IS phenomenal food
Our server recommended our whole meal and was right on the mark with our tastes
Those who have never worked in this business might complain about seating, but in a cozy place like this, seating's a science
Jo Jo is still on top--Go Jean Georges!
This is a dreamy bit of the Left Bank in Manhattan
The menu is simple but far from basic
This is not one of those places with odd concoctions that sound impressive, but taste confusing
The warm asparagus salad is exquisite and the swordfish with carrots and cumin is just out of this world
Weekends are very crowded, and we had to wait 30 minutes even with a reservation- but they were almost overly apologetic and a drink on the house in the tiny wisp of a bar made the wait acceptable
The service is close to the best I have ever experienced- attentive but not intrusive
The townhouse atmosphere is intact and each small dining room has a cozy and intimate feeling
Very romantic, but not hushed
And the most amazing fact is that the prices are stunningy reasonable for such true gourmet fare
Can't wait to go back!
maybe they were having an off night (it happens) but this place was awful
first off, they crammed us into a corner when no one else was even on the same floor as us
the service was inattentive (didn't bring us wine til our main course was already served and didn't open the bottle in front of us!!! major taboo!)
some of our food was served cold
I couldn't beleive it
the food was marginal at best
this place is not worth the money
really not good at all
My three friends and I cleaned our plates-- the food is wonderful and rather interesting
One of my friends commented that she'd had the best steak of my life
Her fries, on the other hand, were pretty unimpressive
The baked salmon (with mashed potatoes and a truffle balsamic reduction) was perfect
All of the desserts were amazing
Service was rather indifferent-- we were never offered a wine list and our water glasses stayed empty for long stretches
The clientele is generally older, and definitely formal
A very nice experience
Especially fine was the steak dish I had
Service was quite nice
unusual too
Waitresses dressed very smartly in black slips
A little crowded tho
Do not go here for intimate conversation, unless you also want to hear what your neighboring diners are saying
The salmon was memorable
Overall excellent value given the quality of the chef
I was seated on time and service was helpful
People in NYC should get over it--small restuarants cannot always seat you on time
The food here is worth a short wait
Went to the 3-course $20 lunch prix fixe at Jojo on a Saturday
it's a great deal for 3 courses at Jojo, but I wouldn't make this restaurant a top priority for other than the lunch special
The food, while very good, was not amazing, service was poor, and I found the atmosphere sort of depressing! SO, a good deal for lunch, but there are better restaurants in the city for the normal price range
I ordered the tasting menu and was not disappointed
The tuna spring rolls and the lamb dish were especially good
I would definitely go back, but not for a romantic dinner
The service got off to an awkward start
My date felt like we were ignored for a few minutes after we read the menu, and our very small table wobbled
The service then improved, but it was distracting to see the staff and customers negotiate the narrow staircase and tight spaces between tables
Despite a number of disappointing reviews on Citysearch, we went to Jo Jo for dinner last week upon a colleague's recommendation
We were not asked to wait at all, but seated immediately
the service was impeccable
and the food was absolutely delicious
The summer vegetable tasting menu is fantastic and the four courses offer just enough food - so that you can actually enjoy each course, and still have room for dessert
I look forward to going back very soon, and can't believe I waited so long to try Jo Jo
The food here is good, but service and attention to comfort is horrendous
Several people had reservations for 8:30 that required over 20 minutes of waiting in a space most certainly not equipped for anything of the sort; Others kept arriving and it all turned into an utter, hot, steamy, cramped zoo!! Upon finally being seated, and a narrow escape from just having missed sitting on a soaked sofa-seat, we are told that they are now out of 2 dishes, including the steak that I was going to have
at 8:30!!! 10:30, maybe, but how bad is the planning at this place?! To top it all off, yep, it was my gf's birthday!!! I have been to Jo jo's before, with very nice results, but this was completely unacceptable, and I wasn't the only one going through it
think twice before going to this place, especially for a special occasion!
Jojo's ruined my birthday
My boyfriend decided to take me to JOJO's for my birthday dinner

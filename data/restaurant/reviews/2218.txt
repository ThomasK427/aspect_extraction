Service is passable
I never really feel I'm being served poorly, but at the same time it's never all that attentive
Some may be made to feel a little uncomfortable, but generally it's decent
Decor is your old school 60's glitz Italian joint
Not exactly romantic, tacky or trendy
I went to Patsy's last night and I have never been treated so rudely or made to feel so unwelcome
The food was alright but I don't understand why this place is known for such great Italian food
I've definitely had better
Not to mention the stuck up host did not help
VERY DISAPPOINTING
I knew we were in trouble when we walked in, the smell was very musty and damp, not the wonderful smell of traditional italian cooking we had expected
We were seated promptly and got our drinks quickly
My cocktail was made wrong and I had to argue with the waiter about it before he would get me another one
The food was very average and there was no atmosphere
There are at least 50 other italian places in the city that are much better!
Let's just say that the waiter our party had was in need of a day off
We all were highly disappointed in the food as well
Our party of 6 was rushed, we were told what we wanted for dessert without seeing the dessert cart
Our reservations was made weeks in advance
My advice skip this 1944 restaurant
When we went to Patsy's, we were greated warmly by the host and taken to our table
The waiters were knowledgable and friendly to us
They made sure that our wine glasses were constanly filled
They served us in a tinely manner
and we enjoyed the meal very much so!  My family has always been treated very well by the Patsy's family
We'll be back
and if the Chairman of the Board was still with us
he'd be back too!
Just had lunch and was happily surprised by the brocolli rabe and the meatballs! Very good traditional Italian food, which is very hard to find in midtown
Went for lunch and tried the prix fixe with friends
We all tried a different item on the menu
Apetizers were good (soup or salad) but entrees were too much on the bland side: not much flavor
Nice food presentation and very professional service but ultimately, food quality is the most important factor
I wouldn't recommend due to high price
Never fails to delight
Patsy's is a slice of the old school NYC that should be treasured
It's not quite Alienist ancient, but harkens back to a simpler time
The food is great, the service is wonderful, the atmosphere is smooth, what more could you ask for in a dinner?
I was sent here on the recommendation of a hotel conceirge and left disappointed
The food was average, but below par for the price
The service was mediocre at best, as the waiter seemed more interested in moving my date and me out of the restaurant than serving us
Put simply, you can do better in NYC for the same money
We visited Patsy's for the first time this past weekend
The food was good, but we had to make a scene with the host several times to get seated
(His wife, the hostese apologized for overlooking us on the reservations list
We had reservations for two for 8:00 pm, but did not get seated until 8:38
Couples with reservations for 8:15 and 8:30 were bering seated on time
) The waiter was teriible also
Had to ask for water refills 3 times
After hearing much about the legendary Patsy's, my fiancee and I decided we had to give it a whirl
It was well worth our time
The ambience is lovely if a bit crowded and loud, the service courteous and helpful, and the wine list oustanding
The menu of traditional fare offers plenty of choices
We found a delicious bottle of Amarone that went perfectly with the veal rollatine I ordered
The place is fabulous, though it could be a bit more intimate
Also, when making reservations I suggest asking for an upstairs table
This place had great pizza
The quintessential ny style pizza -- nice thin, crispy crust, perfectly distributed fresh mozzarella clumps and sweet, fresh tomato sauce
Overall, a great meal
Service was lacking somewhat, as it took about 10 minutes to be seated, with half the tables empty! Once seated, waitress came over promptly
Pizza only took about 10 minutes to be fully cooked
Overall, great place for a quick and relatively inexpensive good meal
Although somewhat expensive for pizza -- 15 dollars for a large pie, this is more than just standard pizza
The ingredients were incredibly fresh -- tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil
The pizza had a nice crispy crust
I recently went to NYC on vacation and a friend told me Patsy's was a good place to eat
I'm a chicken parmagian kinda guy, but I got the stuffed calamari and it was very good
Their sauce is excellent (you can buy it at Southern Season in Chapel Hill by the way)
Great Italian wine selection and good food
If I went to NYC again, I'd probably try a different place, but if you've never been to Patsy's, check it out, I don't think you'll be disappointed
I was 15 years old and my Mother, Aunt and Cousin and I had experienced a day on the town in New York
After a show and shopping, we happened onto Patsy's and it left an indelible imprint on my mind
First off, the aromas are some that I can still conjure
The food, the best
My grandmother, Philomena Albini Ciarlo, could even be outdone! The best part was that I happened to be jabbering on about the fabulous NY Yankees and supposedly, Patsy himself came to my table and graciously gifted me with box seats tickets to the home game against Cleaveland
What gets better than that? Suffice it to say, I am a Director of Sales Marketing for an international Conference Center Management Company
All my clients eat here!!
Our dinner was good, but I say some places in Little Italy do a better job
Service was great
The price was right
Noise level is high, and if you are a non smoker ask to be seated away from the bar
Very old school Italian
The room downstairs is pretty tight in space
The upstairs has more room but needs some updating on the interior decorating
The food is plentiful and good
The stuffed calamari was excellent
Good Italian food in a city location lacking in that area
This place has the best pizza ever!!! I've never had any other food there
Patsy's is the only place I can clean my plate
It's that good! The pasta dishes are appetizing, but the bolognese is magnificent
My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year aniversary
We decided to go to Patsy's for dinner after seeing Cabaret
Because of horrible weather conditions, they said that they might have to close earlier- well they stayed open for us
Even when the only party, other than us was getting ready to leave
The dinner was absolutely one of the tastiest meals I ever had- consistantly through the whole meal
The service was attentive, but not over baring
All and all- very romantic
I looked forward to going to Patsy's for about 1 year
My husband and I finally went there
Seldom do restaurants exceed your expectations, but Patsy's did mine

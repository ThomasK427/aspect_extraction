DO NOT accept a table in the bar area
Very stuffy and on the way to the bathrooms
Food was good and decently prepared
Drinks and desserts very expensive
($11
50 for a cocktail, $9 for a scoop of ice cream) Limited menu
Everything is nice prior to the opera
Kow someone or your in the bar
I too, like many other users, have heard that this is one of the city's most romantic restaurants
I too am perplexed as to why
It looked like the interior of a country club, the tables are crammed very close together (we could hear everybody's conversation-not very intimate) and it exuded a coldness - not even a candle on the table! While the service was good, the food was fair
It was served warm instead of hot
For the prices, I really expected more
Oh well, as with so many NY restaurants, vini, vidi, vici - vamos!
My wife and I have eaten regularly at the Cafe for over thirty years
It is the perfect place for dining pleasure because it is charming, well managed and serves fine food
The restaurant is relatively pricey but the friendliness of the waiters and the sophisticated but warm atmosphere make the dining experience pure pleasure
It's not by chance that President and Mrs
Clinton chose the Cafe des Artistes as their dining place of first choice in this city when they returned after many years elsewhere
George Lang is to be congratulated for keeping this restaurant focused on the highest standards of continental cuisine, service and beauty
I've always wanted to go there!Once I went, believe me, I wish I never did!The food is not that great, the menu is limited and of course overpriced
The service is sucks, it's like when you ask the waiter for something, it looks like it's bothering him! Anyway, the only thing I liked was the fresh flowers all over the place, but that's about it! The best thing we had, was the bottle of Dom Perignon, which of course was also overpriced!
Food was OK but not great
Martini was the best part!  Service was good but not terrific which I would expect from reading the reviews!  Very good wine list! There are better places for much better over all value!
I WENT WITH A FRIEND FOR THE PRIX FIXE LUNCH
IT WAS A GREAT MEAL
THE FOOD WAS AMAZING
THE WAITERS WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING AND SOPHISTICATED WITHOUT BEING STUFFY
THE ROOM WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE DESSERT WAS THE PERFECT END TO A GREAT AFTERNOON
I live in the neighborhood, and I have taken to stopping by at night, when I'm walking my dog, to have a cognac at the Parlor
There's a new chef in the kitchen and the food is really delicious
Sometimes when I come home from work I stop at the bar to have a plate of oysters and something delicious for dinner
Horribly rude bar tender with a major attitude
Staff along with manager were extremely nasty
Bar tender was very discourteous tos ay the least
All was great except couldn't hear any conversation in the dinning room
Bar noise filters into the room
Almost seems like it's piped in
Would be much better if there was a better separation
They probably would have more people too
Tuna steak and burgers were great
But the noise was tooooooo overwheming
Great for people who are totally deaf!!!!!!!!!!
I ate some Pasta at Peter's a couple of years ago and it was great, so I recently thought I would go back
The food was okay, but grossly overpriced
The ambience is still really lovely but the place is just SO loud! Peter's has a popular bar scene that over-flows into the dining room
It was literally impossible to even talk
ate at this place with a date one recent saturday evening and both meals were below par
my crab cakes were overwhelmingly oily (deep fried?) and my date's penne was nothing better than i could have cooked at home
wait staff was excellent, but that can't overcome a waste of $65
Went there on a Sat
night after and liked the ambiance
Wasn't there for dinner, but me and my friends had pub fare (burgers and cheesesteak) and it was prepared very well
I liked the fact that the menu is diverse and it had a nice crowd
I go here for some classic dishes
Great ambiance, but the service is just alright
Don't try the pea soup, it is watery
Brunch was better than expected given the yuppified locale
Stick with the basics and you can't go wrong
(What's stir-fried chicken doing on the menu anyway?) The same can not be said for the exhorbitant $3 for a soda
When will restaurants realize that it's the little things that count and that overt price gouging is the #1 way to turn off potentially loyal customers?
best consistent reliable real japanese food on the upper west side
i've been a regular at this intimate restaurant for 20 years now and the quality and value hasn't changed one bit
if you want some tasty excellent japanese, head to dan! perfect location for pre-lincoln center
The sushi and the hot entrees at Dan Tempura are the closest to authentic Japanese cuisine that I've found on the Upper West Side
DT consistently delivers fresh delicious food at an unbeatable value, and any lack of decor or service is more than compensated for by the truly delicious traditional Japanese food that is served
Hands down, the best Japanese food on the upper west side
Upon entry, I quickly recongnized the staff did not have the New York attitude quite typical to many places in the city
Our waitress was kind and gave us just the right amount of attention
The food was surprisingly delicious, the prices very reasonable, and I would recommend Levana to any friend
The Scene This welcoming favorite owes much of its success to the unfailingly charming owner, Gabriel Aiello
The saffron walls of the large rectangular room are whimsically appointed with colorful art and angled mirrors
Deep, horseshoe-shaped leatherette booths offer a clear view of luminaries from the art and media worlds
Recent soundproofing has significantly improved your chances of eavesdropping on Beverly Sills
The Food The kitchen turns out symphonic pastas and delicious grilled items
Penne arrabiata strikes just the right balance of hot and sweet, as does a simple fettuccine with sausages and peppers; a slathering of horseradish enlivens a tuna steak ringed by fava bean puree
Grilled lamb chops are terrific set over saffron risotto cake with baby turnips
The desserts are all exceptional
For those looking for a well-turned, moderate-to-expensively priced dinner close to the theater district and Lincoln Center, this unassuming American bistro does a nice job
You would hardly notice the restaurant on 60th Street even if it does have a prime location near Columbus Circle simply because the massive Time Warner building complex dwarves it
Yet, you can get a fine pre-theater meal even if the sight of four (count 'em, four) hostesses seems a bit overwhelming
My friend and I were there at around 5:30PM, and a number of guests in their theater finery were already well into their meals
It's a relatively small place, tastefully appointed
just the type of place that wealthy, older Upper West Siders are bound to go to avoid the crowds
A little more pizzazz in their decor wouldn't hurt as there was no one remotely hip in the place (a lot of fur and sequins
and on women, no less), but fortunately the food is quite good
My friend had the pappardelle with quail and mushrooms in a light creamy sauce
It was tasty and the noodles had a nice consistency
But I have to say my order was superb
butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce that was almost decadently flavorful
Our waiter was quite nice and attentive and not the patronizing sort one would expect from such a place
This is definitely an option to consider before a performance at the Met or a Broadway show
My wife I went here for a Birthday dinner and were immediately impressed with the wine list
So many to choose from
The service was attentive without being bothersome
The appetizers(Caesar Salad Portobello Mushroom) came out fresh timely
My wife had gnocchi which was cooked perfectly
I had the salmon which had a really nice sauce
No room for dessert, maybe next time as we'd go back again
After reading good reviews, I was looking forward to dinner here, but it was nothing special

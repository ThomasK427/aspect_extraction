The serivice was great and I we were made to feel more than welcomed but almost like family
We got our food quite fast
I definitely have to recommend a few things which we had: the sangria, the burritos, the quesadillas, the mole, the steak
We all had at least one of these and tried each other's food
It was all quite delicious, and I would love to know their secret ingredients or whatever it is that makes the food taste so amazing!  Again, if you want to try great food in an authentic Mexican environment (we talked to the proprietor) then this is the place for you
I love this Restaurant
I go there at least once a week because the food is amazing
The wait staff is totally friendly and nice and I simply melt over the chicken burritos
I never have a bad time when I go here and I have brought all of my friends here
If you want authentic Mexican food and a great time at a good price go here
The food is amazing and most importantly authentic
I have eaten here on numerous occasions and have walked out with a smile and a happy stomach everytime
The service is just as wonderful as the food
If you don't check this place out you are MISSING OUT!
A few friends decided to take me to El Maguey y La Tuna for my birthday last night, and it certainly was a treat! I've eaten at many different Mexican restaurants all over Manhattan and Brooklyn, but this one is by far the best
The staff was extremely nice and accomodating, and the food was perfect (I had the enchilladas and lots of white sangria)
After experiencing El Maguey y La Tuna, it is now the only Mexican restaurant in New York City that I will ever go to
Simply the best
A warm and inviting restaurant with unequaled food and a gracious staff to match
The service and food is as good as it gets
I dine at fine restaurants all over the country in addition to Southern California and Texas, and the food is really authentic
From the host to the server, the service was excellent
The food was super delicious (and not as pricey as other places) and the dessert tasty with a personal touch
Had the best Cinco De Mayo celebration here! It was crowded, so the service was just a little slow (we thought they ran out of plates), but the staff was very friendly and accomodating
The waitresses led the entire restaurant into celebration after everyone was drunk off of their yummy sangria
We had a very good time, and the food was GREAT
Would definitely return
I know mexican food and I've never tasted mexican as authentic as this in New York City
The waitstaff is unbelieveably helpful/kind and it's still a 'hidden gem' so they have time for special attention and even samplings and tastings of menu items you may not have thought to order
I highly recommend this laidback restaurant with a lot of heart and character behind the idea
This Mexican restaurant is the real deal!! Especially, when you have Tacos de Lengua, Mole Poblano, and Pozole
This is the place to eat at the Lower East Side
And they have Mexican Brunch everyday from 12pm-5pm
Good place to come with a large group or a date!!
Unlike so many Manhattan restaurants, the wait staff at El Maguey really seems to care
Yes, the food was good, but it was the pleasant service that made this place worth going
Where there is good food, great service, and reasonable prices, a restaurant has made its mark
In an invigorating neighborhood like the Lower East Side, where traditional and modern cultures become one, the emergence of El Maguey Y la Tuna is well received
The quality of authentic cuisines from Puebla has not been lost
The warmth of the tortillas in your hand as you dip into the rich mole come close to the meals served at small pueblos
The selection is diverse so that clients have a range of traditional Mexican food and the modern adaptation of it
Even with the move from Brooklyn, the Chili Rellenos and Enchiladas are still to die for
The ambiance is one that is left to the client, which is perfect for big groups
The excitement that comes from sizzling platters can be soothed by the expanded Mexican beer selection
I recommend this place for anyone who wants to go eat in Puebla but enjoys living in the LES
The experience could have been a lot better had the service been more adequate
After waiting for quite a while, our drinks, appetizers and fajita entree were served at the same time
Fajitas were served sans tortillas or sides, so it just sat there getting cold, while we finished off the appetizer and waited for my guy's entree
Finally, I said something and they took it back to warm it up
Then his food arrived and we waited for mine
And waited and waited, until we had to say something again
When I did get it, it was only lukewarm, masking the flavor I could have gotten out of it
I will go back, because the head waitress made a sincere effort to apologize and the food was reasonably good
But if I ever see our waitress from that night again, I'm running out the door screaming
This is a great little Mexican place close to Parkside Lounge
The food is some of the most authentic Mexican I've had in NYC, and the BEST mole
Everything tastes like it just came out of mom's kitchen
The portions are huge and the prices are very cheap
Fresh corn tortillas, nice and spicey salsa, great sangria, a ton of entree options, and darn good desserts
This place just opened up on a barren stretch of Houston, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood
The staff is so friendly, the food is home-cooked goodness at an inexpensive price and it's right around the corner from my apartment :) Forget Clinton St - this place is THE neighborhood restaurant
Plus, they were the only place serving actual food during the blackout, so I am forever loyal
In Short Using only organic, fair-trade coffee beans, the coffee here is brewed in a unique stir-brew style
The coffee is complemented by organic (and occasionally vegan) pastries and juices, and a friendly atmosphere
The small space, with only a few tables, features special events such as movie nights; newspapers and magazines are available for the perusal of lingering customers
This place is great, by far the best in the neighborhood
The service a real treat, always very cheery and friendly
The food is good, although the bagels are not the best, the sandwiches from Salt are amazing and the croissants are outstanding
great coffee, but running out of bagels at 11am on a sunday, not so good!
Great art on the walls, and friendly environment
Who knew that the New Yorkers can come togather like this?!
Jack couldn't be a nicer person and he has brought his personality into this quaint but excellent coffee stop
The help is attentive
The decor and presentation is totally unpretentious -- like Jack
There is an old village authenticity here like no other
PS a warning and correction
The cross street is Greenwich Avenue, not Greenwich street
An important distinction as there is both
If Ya wind up on Greenwich Street, you are way out of your way!  Congrats, Jack and thanks
It was my first morning as a resident of New York and I found myself restless, as I am most mornings when the clock is nearing 6:30
Picking up the Times on the corner I decided to take a walk
Following the brisk dawn air down West 10th, I soon encountered Jack's
It wasn't yet open so I sat on the welcoming wooden bench and began to take in the day's news
Not two minutes would pass before a smile ushered me in out of the cold, graciously serving me the best cup of coffee I've yet to taste, all of this before normal opening hours
I've been back every morning since
Great vibe, great coffee, great cookies
I wish this place was closer to my apartment, but I make the special trip across the hood to hit Jack's
Ive only gone to this place on Wednesday when they have the 10cent deal on the wings
Its definitely a great deal and the wings are one of the best Ive tasted yet
Everytime that Ive gone, Ive gotten my food promptly
The only thing I can complain about is the service, a couple of the waitresses are awful
They take their time to bring you your drinks as well as to give you the check when you've requested it, we even had an experience where the waitress didnt return back the change
we had to ask for it, and when we did she got an attitude
We weren't going to nix her on her tip as she might have thought, we were just going to add a couple of extra bucks
All in all, I would just recommend going there for the food and forget about getting great service
I don't know why I kept agreeing to go here, maybe its the promise of ten cent chicken wings, maybe its the beautiful garden area, but I have finally learned my lesson
This place is awful! It is mostly based on the service I admit
I have been to this place three times and the service/management keeps getting worse
This last time I almost got into a fight with the waitress
She refused to get me a drink after I went to the bar to get a different round

We sat down on Monday night at 8:00
There were only 8 other tables in there with 6 servers, 6 bussers and 2 men in suits
After 20 minutes of no service, we walked out and the hostess said bye, thanks
No one noticed
In times like this people need to spend their money wisely and it should never be at Compass
Get it together- there are too many restaurants out there who care about service
Our evening at Copass was one of the best nights out we've had in years
The service was attentive and anticipated our every need
The prix fix menu was excellent and a great bargain, but after seeing what everyone else got I wished I had ordered off the regular menu
One of the worst dining experiences of my 10 years in NYC
They were out of virtually everything on the menu, meal arrived cold, obtrusive service, and worst of all, a $100 bottle of chardonnay was poured WARM
Terrible accoustics ruin conversation
I could go on and on
Don't bother
Dinner at Compass was one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant in NYC
Rude bartenders, indifferent host who forgot to seat us, flustered and totally untrained staff, food which is overpriced and took ages to come out of the kitchen
Given the number of wonderful restaurants (both cheap and expensive) in this town - Compass is going nowhere fast
Crowded, noisey, trendy
I loved it! Very friendly staff, with service to match
While the $30 prix fixe menu is somewhat limited, it is a good value
The risotto fritters were very tasty
The hangar steak was tender and juicy
The creme brulee was delicious
After desert, the waiter then brought out a desert sampler of berries and cream with a doggie bag of cookies
Worth the voyage to the Upper West Side
For a new restaurant trying to get people to frequent their facilty, we were dissapointed
We chose the pre fix restaurant week deal
The fritters were like frozen rice balls with some sauce added
The steak was tough
The waiter had a slight attitude and brought our wine aprroximately 10 minutes into our appetizer
The coat check staff was the most pleasant part of the experience
We will never go back even for the regular menu
They blew it!!!
The tasty and well presented food was unfortunately offset by the abysmal service during Sunday brunch
It took 20 minutes to receive a glass of orange juice, and another ten to be served coffee
The milk and sugar arrived in phases, as did the salt and pepper for the omelet
First and last impressions were consistent with the table service received - not as much as a hello or thank you from coat check
Is there a manager in charge?
Despite the mixed reviews I see here, I enjoyed my evening at Compass very much - including a tour of the kitchen and garde-manger areas
The private dining suite is lovely and the main dining room was elegant
Service was A+ and we enjoyed everything from the sumptuous foie gras appetizer to the paired wines with dinner and dessert
They even made home-made marshmallow, subtly scented with lemon zest
What a treat
Not cheap, though - so bring your credit cards or have mumsy and daddy foot the bill
I wanted to show some special out-of-town guests a great dining experience, and am so pleased that we landed at Compass
From my starter (a white bean soup with generous foie gras accent) to the last morsel of my unique crunchy Napoleon dessert, we were delighted
The service could not have been more polished and attentive
Whether it was the effects of the gorgeous red mural, the lovely food, or maybe
the wine - we left with the glow of a wonderful New York evening
This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in months
The service was impecable from start to finish
We started at the bar with a perfect cosmo for only ten bucks! Our waiter not only went out of his way but we felt like the only table in this romantic restaurant
I ordered the Nantucket Bay Scallops which were not only beautifully presented but the sweetest I have ever had
We couldn't decide on a dessert, luckily our waiter suggested the apple strudel with a hot carmel sauce, it was EXCELLENT!! I would recommend this place to romantics, businessmen and large parties
A steep price doesn't make it good! Food was slow and average, despite glued-smiles delivering
Staff is way to snotty for the tacky and stiff decorations and boring faire
As ambient as a dinner served in mess hall (but with table clothes)
Even on the UWS there are better options for the price
Undoubtedly a welcome addition to the UWS
The bar is very flash, and big enough to accommodate big groups
Be prepared to wait for your drink, however, if you're not sporting silk or cashmere
The main dining area offers a delicious menu, which goes some way in erasing the bad feelings created by the spotty and sometimes snotty (the sommelier) service
Really, the food is excellent - even on the 30$ prix fixe (which, by the way, barely offsets the exceedingly expensive wine list: there were five $300 bottles for every one under $50)
This place was hopping on a Tuesday night - it really is a welcome addition
This bar is perfect- swanky without being pretentious
I liked the grey decor and the sleek-looking bar
They have a nice bar menu- I recommend the cheese plate
The service wasn't wonderful but nothing to complain about
Service really needs work - our well-intentioned waitress was slow, disorganized, and got the order wrong
No way could be used for pre-Lincoln-Center meal: we'd miss the show
Food was good but overpriced for what we got
Ambience needs some oomph - very elderly crowd, atmosphere a bit snobby
Bar in front is very smoky
FROM THE WARM WELCOME BY THE MAITRE D' TO THE LAST DROP OF COFFEE COMPASS DOES IT ALL RIGHT
THE MENU IS SOPHISTICATED IS WELL EXECUTED
THE CHOPPED OR BEAN SALADS ARE GREAT STARTERS
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOLESTEROL PROBLEM THE LIVER IS CULINARY HEAVEN
IF YOU DO, IT WILL SEND YOU THERE IN GOOD STYLE
THE HALIBUT PREPARATION WOULD CHALLENGE OCEANA
THE DESSERTS ALL THE EXTRA PERKS PUNCTUATED ONE OF THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCES WE'VE HAD IN YEARS
COMPASS IS ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING A NYC CULINARY LEGEND JBARIE,MD
The food was simply delicious
(I was pleasantly surprised
) Try the heirloom tomato salad as an appetizer
I have never tasted sweeter tomatoes in my life
I also recommend the scallops as an app
They were cooked perfectly prepared with a tasty carrot ragout
Even sweeter were the desserts
The chocolate espresso cake was to die for the strawberries perfectly ripe
They even send you home with scones to sweeten your morning the next day
A bit pricey, but who cares when the food is actually good
Was there on a Tuesday night and received outstanding service
The food was great and the atmosphere was perfect
highly recommended
Good food, Excellent services and Romantic atmosphere
THe $30 prix fixed meal is a good buy
The ambience was gorgeous, the food unusual and delicious and the service impeccable
I went to Compass with my ex-boyfriend for my birthday and was treated like a princess
I would definitely recommend it to everyone
My friends and I went to Compass for girls night out and the food was amazing

Be forewarned that this probably is not the place for you and your grandma on Saturday night, but if you crave good food and and exciting atmosphere you should check it out
My friends and I went to Lupa and had lunch on a Sunday and were thoroughly disappointed
The waitress couldnt remeber anything and by the time she did remember something, it was no longer necessary
I was especially disappointed with the food
I ordered a buccatini pasta with red sauce which should be something relatively easy to make
The cooks at Lupa found a way to screw it up
The pasta was undercooked to the point that it was still crunchy
I sat in amazement that this italian restaurant could screw this up
A friend of mine ordered a pasta dish as well but it was spicy and no where in the description did it mention any spiciness
Food was definitely overpriced and the service sucked
IT WAS PLAIN HORRIBLE
Management really needs to get their act together
To all those considering going there
BEWARE!
the sceene is very nice, nothing extraordinary
simple but with great taste
The service was terrific and the food spectacular
The tables are very close together, this might bother some but I feel it's no problem
I deffenetly will go back, for the quality and atmosphere of the place I found the price to be low
I highly recommend it and will look forward to taking out of town visitors there
We had a party of 6 and though we were seated 15 minutes late, they did give us a plate of prosciutto
The Wednesday special of Pork Loin with chard was excellent and memorable
Went late with a reservation, was seated right away
Smelled great in there
Service was ok, the sommelier wasn't committed and just pointed at the more expensive bottles
The waitress was friendly, but forgot to ask if we wanted some drinks to start with
She was knowledgable, though, and her faux pas could have been because she was stressed/ tired
The prociutto was amazing, as was the olive oil we got to drizzle on it
One appetizer was eggplant mousse on ricotta cheese
The dish was fenomenal
The Saltimbocca was just ok, the Marsala sauce/ reduction they could have given us more of
But my husband loved it
I loved his three meat fettucini, great mix of meat, garlic, tomatoes and juts dressed in the meat sauce, not floating in it, which is a mistake many American-Italian restaurants make
The desserts were fine, but not amazing
I'll be back
My wife and I were nonplussed
My friend Dio gave it a great review and we got lucky - it was a snow storm the night we showed up without a res
so we got to sit down right away (feel bad for other posters who waited an hour) - so that was good
Service was swift and pleasant but for the price I just wasn't wowed
Some of the appetizers were interesting - actually I would suggest just ordering a bunch of the appetizers and passing on the main dish
The main courses were pricey and uneventfull - I don't know, maybe we ordered the wrong thing -
A friend said its better than my favorite restaurant in Milan
Thats a joke
The food is totally overpriced and boring
We paid $ 300 for 3 people
The service was great and very friendly but don't believe the hype
It is just about adable
Stay away
One of the better meals I have had, ever
Cuisine is more like Italian peasant food, so if you are not willing to experiment or are expecting simple, common Italian food, this may not be your place
If that does not bother you, this is definitely a place to go
The food and entire experience was fabulous !
I come to NY every year for the marathon
This is the second time we have eaten at Lupa
The quality of the food is fantastic but we found the menu a little restricting
Food presented well and the service once we were seated was great but we had a long wait for our table (about half an hour) even though I had pre-booked
I would return
we went really early to try this place
i've tried so called better restaurants in NYC but wow, this place blew me away both with food and price
had great wine
appetizer, main
dessert
and spent a bit more than $100
that's a bargain
now it's one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
Love the food at LUPA, eating at the bar is great too
The best antipasto cured meats, as well as amazing papparadelle w/ ragu
Nice selection of Italian wines
Good price value
My favorite dessert in the winter was stewed dates on mascarpone cheese served in individual copper pots! YUM
My only complaint would be the uncomfortable rush seat chairs, and the dopey young hostesses at the front, who won't seat you until your entire party arrives (even when the tables are empty!), also they put you on HOLD FOREVER! But, it is worth waiting, the food is THAT GOOD!
Mario is a genius! Lupa has the simplist food with the most exquisite flavors
Extremely casual setting with no dress code
Heirloom tomatoes with buffalo riccotta - incredibly yummy, served at room temperature to enhance the flavors of the fresh herbs and tomatoes
Barciola with mint was to die for - tender and flavorful
The gnocchi with sausage and fennel was unbelievable, it was light as a feather with the perfect balance of seasonings
Wine list was elaborate and very affordable
I love Babbo and I love Lupa, I can't decide which is better - they are both outstanding in every way
Try them both
We went for the restaurant week lunch, and it was just an amazing lunch
Their pastas are unbelievably fresh, meats cooked perfectly, and sauces with such sharp flavor they must be strained several times
The lemon sorbet was the best dessert I have had in a long time
we ate at lupa on a busy friday nite and had a great experience
i jut asked the waiter to feed us and gave him guidelines on the wine and we sat back and enjoyed!
the sardines are worth the trip and the octopus salad was a treat
the pasta was lucious and our only disapointment was the selection of whole roasted chicken as our entree
while delicious we eat so much chicken!
but then we should have told him ahead of time
the marscapone was excellent
will visit again on th next trip! be sure and make a reservation!
I suggest eating at the bar
Bartenders are laid back and helpful
We were seated and the waiter was obnoxious, acted put out by having to wait on us
Appetizers were good
Wine's are really nice
We ordered one fish and one pasta to splt
He brought us the wrong pasta, didn't offer to correct the mistake so we offered to eat it anyways
The fish was ok but not great anh his attitude was poor enough to prevent me from coming back or recommending LUPA
Try Picallo Angelo for a great Italian meal
Securing a table at Lupas can be a little exasperating as they seem to be booked through eternity, but once you do, there is no better seat in town

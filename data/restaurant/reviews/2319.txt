One of few nice kid-friendly restaurants
I would come back with my friends for inexpensive, no-greasy, relax dining
Great food but the service was terrible
Extremely RUDE servers who intially took our order and never returned with drinks or to see if we required anythign else
We complained to the management and he did nothing! I would NOT reccomend this place to anyone, try another patsy where the service and food go one and one
I was very disappointed with the pizza
The crust was mushy and doughy
I doubt if I'll ever go back
Dining at il riccio was the one of the best out-of-the room activities my wife and I had on our short Honeymoon in the Capital Town Of The World
We were lucky to found this restaurant close to our hotel
We did not have a lot of time to search around
But what we found was amazing
Nice, cozy, and romantic place with very friendly vibe
We got table on the second floor next to window
Great table
Waiter who took care of us was on the ball
Easy going and not pretentious
We left up to him to decide our diner and he made our evening
Everything he choose was perfect
Fist course, second, third
desert, wine
Just what we were looking for
People, they know pasta
Next trip to NY and we'll be there again

ask for karmain the owner with pony tail
Pros: Great food, Great service, Reasonable price
A friend recently recommended Il Riccio, and I really enjoyed it! The staff is very friendly
There is a wonderful wine list
The food is simply prepared with fresh foods-- very flavorful
I had stuffed Zucchini Flowers (a special) and Linguine with Clams
It is the closest to being in Amalfi without being there!
Every meal has a flare all its own
The menu becomes unnecessary after the daily specials are read
Prepared with care and courtesy Il Riccio is a true find
The wine list and waiter reccomendations have never steered me wrong
The welcoming atmosphere is a NY rarity and the garden is not to be missed!
This is just one of the best restaurants in the city
I can't believe that I have lived here so long and just discovered it recently
The variety of food is wonderful but even better is its taste
Its quiet, romantic and the perfect place to sit back with a glass a wine and enjoy
The Scene Back in the 90s, David Burke's audacious New American creations made a cannonball-sized splash on the Upper East Side
Flash forward a decade and over 50,000 Swordchops later, and the outsized Americana of the venture seems a little pass
Charming servers do their best to ameliorate the oddness of supping on a chop while seated under a Kermit cookie jar, but there's not much dignity one can impart when noosed by an American flag necktie
The Food Ingredients are ridiculously generous in places--crisp fries luxuriate in decadent pools of truffle mayonnaise, and pepper-sharpened Pastrami Salmon (also trademarked) couples piquantly with caviar-dolloped creme fraiche and dreamy corn blini
Main courses, however, pack their punch in presentation rather than flavor
Double up on appetizers and jump straight to the scrumptious, Calder-esque desserts
Their tuna tartare and their bread was delish
the dishes my bf and i ordered tasted good and the presentation was one of the best i've seen
stay away from their filet mignon and order something else, like the rackof lamb
I ordered their chocolate martini and i was so tipsy after one glass
talk about a strong martini
Will definitely eat here again
My lunch at Park Ave Cafe was good, but not memorable
At $16 a burger and $26 for a lobster roll, the food is definitely expensive
The fries are as yummy as everyone says and both and burger and lobster roll were above-par
With the exception of the kind hostess, the service was horrific - do the waiters KNOW how to crack a smile? One would expect excellent service at a place like Park Ave Cafe! Atmosphere was lovely, and the food hit the table fast
I'm glad I gave it a shot
but I'm not quite sure if I'll be going back
The food was not what i had expected
The food was extremely salty that i had to drink multiple cups of water when i got home
The waiter/bus boy service was beyond annoy
They will constantly walk by your table and look as if you are going to steal something off the table
We didn't even have food on the table yet and they kept on walking by staring
The food was beyond expensive for what we ordered and not worth the money at all
I've been to many upscale restaurants and this place was no as good as others
I highly will not recommend this place to anyone
I some friends took me to park avenue for this thing call pay your age
Its were you can get a three course meal for your age
That was a great idea
We had a great meal, it was very fresh and the deserts were amazing
I had such a great time
If you find yourself close to Park Avenue and East 63rd Street around lunch time, I recommend giving Park Avenue Cafe a try
On my last visit, our group of six had different appetizers and different small plates (offered at lunch)
The food was good, the service excellent, the atmosphere calm
The decor is oddly quirky though
I've had dinner at Park Avenue Cafe twice and I don't recommend it
It is very expensive
New York has too many excellent restaurant to settle for an average one
But, it's good for lunch
I was a little skeptical having read some other reviews
But wow, the food was amazing having been to some of the top restaurants is the city this was one of my favorites
The wine list was normal and the mixed drinks were a little excitting
My friends had a great time and I agreed with them that the food was some of the best in the city
The servers were friendly
I would highly recomend this restaurant
I had an amazing brunch last sunday at park ave
My wife had the french toast with so many sides like peaches, maple syrup ect
I had the benedict which was different because they serve pork tenderloin instead of the bacon so it was not dry
The cocktails were great and I had one of the best brunches I have had in the city in a while
I would recommend it and would like to go back for dinner
All their foods are rather bland They do have a fine selection of wine and their service is pretty good, not great
Their dessert however, seems to have more flavor than the dinner
the decor is pretty stark, not at all romantic and the huge American Flag mural against the back wall gives it the impression of sitting in a lodge!
Came for brunch on a sunday - the menu didn't really contain many items i would consider brunch! There was only one appetizer and 4 entres that seemed brunch-ish
i had the fruit apetizer which was fine, rather boring, and then people around me had french toast which was also very uninspired
The rest of the menu had selections like wild salmon, steak, and lamb (for brunch?!)
the service was also painfully slow and i found the atmosphere to be very stuffy and boring
I first ordered a glass of german riesling and was served a french one without any notice from the bartender

Ah, we've arrived at Blue Ribbon Sushi
Ask any real fan of sushi, the one's who have traveled all the way to Japan to sample genuine Sword Fish, Char, Milk Fish, or Orange Clam
Well, don't worry about Airfare, cause BRS has it all
In fact they are the only one that boasts so many types of cold water fish, and shell fish
Get ready for some of the best sushi in the world
5 STARS
Blue Ribbon Sushi is a once in a lifetime expirience
The first time being the best
People walking out telling us how much of a treat we were in for, man, were they right! Since then we have gone back probably 50 times in the last 4 years
Each time trying something new that no other sushi restaurant has
Each time people watching for movie stars and New York Celebrities
Each time trying very different types of Sake (Rice Wine), each time sampling fish we'd never even heard of before, each time being delighted again, and again, and again!
Blue Ribbon Sushi is my all time favorite sushi restaurant in the Tri-State area
I've been to most of the so-called best places, and most of them have sky high prices and very few types of fish
Blue Ribbon has over 50 varieties, all 1day fresh, and prepared by some of the best sushi chefs in the world
The restaurant is a cool place on Sullivan in the heart of SOHO, they play classic Jazz, and you'll probably see some celebrities
My wife and I have seen Movie Stars every time we go
My favorite dish (tough call) is the very simple Negi-Toro, it's astounding!
For less than 20 bucks not including the tip, we had a wonderful meal
An Egg like custard appetizer, a platter of different kinds of rolls made from: Lobster, Eel, Sword Fish, Trout, Blue Fin Tuna, Horse Mackerel, and Salmon Roe
We loved it, and will be returning again soon
Well regarded nation wide as one of the best places in the world
Blue Ribbon Sushi has far more than a cult following, packed daily from Noon till 3 AM, with hipsters, celebrities, Sashimi Lovers, and of course SOHO locals, it's breath taking menu, Superb Fare, Lengthy Sake List, and pro seating system have earned it a 5 STAR rating with The Sushi Times: 6 years running
The only 5 STAR sushi restaurant currently in the Big Apple!
I have had numerous fantastic meals at Blue Ribbon Sushi, but the last one was particularly great since I proposed to my wife, and she took my hand in engagment
The staff could not have been kinder or more courteous
Three movie stars sitting next to us bought us a bottle of the single best sake we've ever had, and our Sashimi platter (fish served nowhere else in NYC) was gorgeous
Since Blue Ribbon scaled the size of the fish back to traditional size last summer, it's really become the best the city has to offer!
All the Blue Ribbons are amazing, including Brooklyn, Bakery, and of course the original, just down the block from sushi
After being disappointed and ripped off at holes like Jewel Bako and Kuruma Zushi, I had the pleasure and fortune of eating at Blue Ribbon Sushi
The Tigers Eye, Honoo Platter, White Salmon Toro, and Artic Char sushi were completley beyond compare
Thanks for a great meal!
Blue Ribbon Sushi is the best sushi restaurant in the U
S
, as I have been to the top sushi restaurants in all 50 states
The amazing array of fish, in old and new styles in just phenomenal
The last reviewer: caste_away is a liar, slabs of fish
Blue Ribbon only has true masters behind the sushi bar, many are bribed away to work the many Blue Ribbon Sushi Clones around NYC, like Haru, Jewel Bako, and Bond Street
None of these can compare in any way with the best!
I'm sorry if anyone got to eat or spend money on this terrible excuse for a sushi restaurant
Slabs of low grade fish does not make sushi automatically
From all the good reviews I thought this would be a nice place to dine, I went there and waited for a while to get seated
When it was all said and done I was completely un-impressed
The chef's menu is a true joke
My girlfriend tried something from the Atlantic menu
oooh,
sucked!  An insult to the taste buds and to the pocket
I've given this restaurant many chances
one too many because I should have figured it out at first
The sashimi is average at best
The maki is dull and un-inspiring, found at any supermarket
Are they supposed to make us believe that this is the best sushi NY has to offer? Plllease! And to top it all off, the staff is rude and arrogant as if they are entiteled to be so because the restaurant has once offered semi-decent food
If you want a yuppie, pretentious crowd, lots of tourists, and chefs who don't know fugu from inada, and a manager who laughs all the way to the bank, come here
If you want honest, authentic sushi, creative, and tasteful, go somewhere else
NYC has many other better sushi restaurants, real restaurants (as opposed to stale sushi)
I recommend Kuruma Zushi, Nobu, and the best newcommer, Jewel Bako
best sushi i've ever had, served by a professional staff in a soothing atmosphere of jazz and intimate lighting minus the pretence the big bucks
all this at 1 in the morning
only in new york!
we were a party of eight and had no reservations to our surpirse we didn't have to wait because it was early and they only had a few tables
easily the most memorable sushi dinner i've had
the toro was tantalizing, savory lobster teamed with caviar in a roll with japanese mint was fabulous
pleasant knowledgeable staff rounded off our experience
looking forward to coming back!
came in on friday waited forever it was worth it
amazing sea urchin from santa barbara, monk fish foie gras tangy buttery the best i've had
words cannot do justice for fish of this quality
plenty of specials to chose from different kinds of tuna, salmon, white fish yellowtail
the range of sakes they offer is unique lenghty unusual for a sushi place
the most considerate servers a green tea flavor creme brulee that wasn't chalky!
The sake tasted like vinegar because their amateur operation probably stores all types of sake in the same basement container
When my girlfriend and I complained, the rude waiter said that there was nothing he can do
Unfortunately this forsaken place is opening another joint
god help us all
Why do people still go here? I don't understand!
We have waited over 3 hours to get into Blue Ribbon Sushi lots of times and it is always worth it
They take your cell phone number and you go to a book store or bar and hang out till they call you
The amazing appetizers are too numerous to list, as is the fish list, covering over 50 varieties (most in NY), the chefs (7 of them) are masters, and churn out meals that have reached legendary status
The sake list is a seperate menu due to its length, and the new age rolls are fantastic
It's expensive, but what would you expect in the Heart of SOHO in a 5 STAR restaurant
One of the best restaurants in the city
Serves really good sushi
Not the biggest portions but adequate
Green Tea creme brulee is a must! Don't leave the restaurant without it
What a place! Some of best Sushi in town
Let the chef decide for you and you're in for a delightful treat
I'm visiting from Alaska, where believe it or not, we have pretty good sushi restaurants
When I got here I first tried Kuruma Zushi, which was the biggest rip off I've ever seen, it sucked, then we tried Jewel Bako, and we saw first hand just how awful service can be in the Big Apple
Then we had a great meal at Blue Ribbon Bakery on Bedford Street, and the waiter said to try Blue Ribbon Sushi
Single best piece of advice we ever received
Blue Ribbon Sushi is AMAZING
We waited in a bar till our table was free, they called us on the cell phone
The meal was unreal! I've never even heard of half the delicious fish we had
I can't say enough great things about Blue Ribbon Sushi!
Having eaten sushi/sashimi all over this country and Europe, Japan, South Pacific, and New Zealand, I can easily say Blue Ribbon Sushi is easily the best in the U
S
You get traditional bite size sushi/sashimi and the new age Rolls using the freshest fish in a tantalizing variety of almost 50 types
The sake is great, the desserts are superb, the service is great for the Big Apple, the look is cool, and the quiet music (jazz) is soothing
Having no real competition in the city, this always packed sushi restaurant is open till around 3:00 AM
A word of advice, try the appetizers (non sushi), they are among the best I've ever had

The place was really boring -- menu, food, decor
It was nearly empty when I was there, probably because there are so many more interesting and fun places to eat on Smith St
(in fact, a great Peruvian place just opened up directly across Smith St
from Saul a few months ago) that there's no reason to waste your time or money on this place
I took my girlfriend to Saul's for her birthday and had a very satifying experience - i had the chicken, sausage and wild mushroom and spinach risotto, which was finger-licking good
The foie gras was sweet and luscious
My gf's duck confitte was very solid as well, although i have little base of reference
Like its menu, Saul is small, and has simple brick-wall decor
Although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive
Highly recommended
Smith Street is packed with places, Saul is by far the best! We went with a group of 7 and were seated right away
Everyone tried a different entree and each one was divinely great
I've never had veal so tender and tasty
We've been to the Grocery (a couple of blocks away), which is good, but not as great as Saul
Period
Just go
Eat well! Try hard to ignore the light FM
After traveling to a number of cosmopolitan cities and trying a number of delicious restaurants, I can say without a doubt Restaurant Saul without is one of the top restaurants out there
We hosted our wedding reception there and experienced such thoughtful service, fabulous food, and a lovely atmosphere; it surpassed every expectation
I highly recommend Restaurant Saul for every and any occation
I can't say it enough times: Saul is the best restaurant in Brooklyn, possibly New York
I have loved every dish I have ordered there
I like the taster starter they give you before the meal (always great) and have always had good service
This is a place to take out of town friends and relatives to to impress them with your culinary taste, and it's a place to enjoy a deux when you just want to eat well
My friend and I enjoyed choosing from a very diverse menu of appetizers and entrees
The desserts are very rich and a little to sweet for my taste following such a wonderful meal
What can I say: they were too tempting to pass over
Saul is a very comfortable room which did get a little loud at a couple of times during the evening but on the whole it was a very relaxing pleasant environment
The staff were incredibly attentive but never intrusive
We fully intend to return
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill
Please save yourself the frustration
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes
Such a disappointment
Rude service, medicore food
there are tons of restaurants in NY
stay away from this one
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story
Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter
Decent wine at reasonable prices
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
Our teenage kids love it, too
we landed upon Leon somewhat randomly on the 4th of July and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty, inexpensive cuisine
i got the mussels (yum!) and my husband the duck special (divine) and were not disappointed
the service was somewhat spotty, but we were rewarded with free drinks and the waiters were all sweet and lovely, genuinely french-speaking but not snooty!
the wait staff is very friendly, if your not rude or picky
our meal at Leon last weekend was great - and the wait staff is very prompt and proactive
although, like all waiters anywhere - if you start getting impatient or decide to create your own version of their perfectly balanced plates, of coarse the waiter is going to give you TUDE
to those people I say the grocery store is down the street, your better off fiving it yourself
plus Leon is in a great neighborhood
I recommend any of their salmon dishes
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission
This is probably one of my new favorite places
The Scene  Dark, loud and adorned with arty objects, this huge industrial space is packed every night
While the three frenetic kitchens seem to work according to the motto "serving Williamsburg one plate at a time" (with less-than-enthusiastic servers), all is forgiven when the astonishingly low check comes
The Food  Most restaurants with more than 250 items on the regular menu don't do any of them particularly well
Neither do most restaurants that try tackling Thai, sushi and hibachi
But with a bite of tangy tamarind-fried squid, and a sip of steaming miso, you'll find Planet Thailand a welcome exception to both of these rules
Consistently satisfying versions of Thai staples like pad Thai and curry dishes arrive in generous portions
The sushi is fresh and basic, but other Japanese dishes, like wasabi shumai and seafood udon, fill the creative gap
i went to my friends birthday party w/ a group of 6 other people
1) they gave us the wrong table had to wait 10 minutes until they gave us the one we wanted 2) had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter 3) ordered chicken and brocolli
worst chicken i have ever ate tastes like wood 4) rice wasnt great either
kind of dry and old (not cooked enough) 5) service was ok not got not bad
i dont know what these other reviewers are saying
the waiter brought my friend 3 different sauces b/c my firend want ed tot ry them all :) AVERAGE 3
5 stars out of 5
Planet Thai is great! We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere! The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must! Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap! Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT! Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait
It's popular w/the late crowd
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there
What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good
It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve
The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip
Went for dinner last night after trying to go to SEA Thai a few blocks away and being told over an hour wait
great food, even better price, they also have a dj spinning great music, definitely a must try
Will go back soon!
Okay so I went here for my birthday celebration about two a week and a half ago
The service was not the greatest, but the place is huge and it has a nice setting
It used to be a factory (I heard), but they did a great job with it
It's really nice
I didn't like that they had unisex restrooms and only two! But it's okay the FOOD was GREAT! and yes me and my party of 7 waited nearly an hour for our food, but the Food was GREAT and everyone enjoyed it
Also when we received the check it was REALLY CHEAP for all the food we ordered
So, if you have some time to wait, it will be worth it!
Very affordable and excellent ambient! We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai
We were very disappointed
We won't go to this place again for a good meal
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks
I absolutely love this place!!! From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since
The sushi is amazing!!! And amazingly cheap
Big thumbs up!

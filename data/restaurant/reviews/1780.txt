Portions are more than generous and the pricing is very reasonable
With so many new restaurants opening it's easy to forget an old favorite
I hadn't been to Gonzo in quite a while and recently went back
I almost forgot how fabulous the food really is
Try one of Chef Vincent Scotto's signature Grilled Pizzas (we had the wild mushroom, corn mashed potato looked great also)
Go on to amazing Shortribs which are literally falling of the bone
I couldn't decide between the Pork Tenderloin with Grandma's applesauce and Penne Veal Ragu so we ordered both split them
This made for a perfect dinner
If you're feeling decadent give the brown sugar cheesecake or the ice cream sandwich a try
If you just want a little something sweet, go with the panna cotta with pineapple compote
To those who have never tried Gonzo, I say run don't walk to West 13th Street
I have been a fan of Gonzo's for a long time and I have to say that upon recently having dinner there again, it's never been better
The corn tomato pasta and the pizzas are sublime! You can also try a variety of well-priced wines by the glass
The staff is always friendly and I'm going to be going back again sooner rather than later!
the staff is extremely nice
had great pizza and pasta was good too
bf had liver which he loved
We had a reservation for 9:30 on Saturday night and after waiting 30 minutes I asked the hostess for a status on our table
She said the table had already paid and they were just waiting for the party to leave
She apologized profusely and even said they'd give us a free pizza because she felt awful
We waited another 30 minutes and finally asked to speak to the manager
When my husband approached the manager, he refused to speak to him saying he was too busy to deal with him and if we didn't want to wait then we should just leave! The manager then instructed the hostess to not seat us and to give us our coats
I have never in my life been treated like this at any establishement
The best restaurant I have been to in a very long time
The only problem was deciding what to eat
My wife and I shared a grilled pizza,mashed potato and corn as an appetizer and it was terrific
The highlight for me was the Penne Gratin
If you love cheese, you will love this
It was so good I have no recollection of what my wife ordered
Dessert was great and the service, which has had mixed reviews,was outstanding! Price was very reasonable
We will be regulars
Amazing pizza and desserts, great atmosphere, good wine
But the best part was the service, which was incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive
We had to make a movie in time, and we were served promptly but never rushed to get out
We were VERY impressed and definitely will go back
One of the best meals that I've had in NYC in a while
The pizza was phenomenal, the salami and cheese plate was like being in Roma
Highly recommend!
Always a wonderful comforting meal
The (unique) pizzas and pastas are second to none
not to mention the desserts !!!
Definitely start off the meal by splitting a few pizzas - they are extremely delicate, yet full of flavor (love the garlic!)
If you are a fan of sauteed calamari, go for the main course
This was one of the best that I have had
Every one that I was with loved everything that they ordered
The service, on the other hand, could use a lesson on manners!
Gonzo was THE WORST dining experience
I was taking my very significant other to dinner for his birthday
BAD IDEA!!!!! 1
The dining area was so loud we were shouting to each other across the table
2
I asked for a nice table (out of the bustle), we got the first table right next to the semi-open kitchen
3
We waited for someone to take our order for about 15 minutes
Nevertheless, I was hoping the food was going to compensate for the lack of atmosphere
Well, the food was second-rate
The cheese and meat sampler was not served properly, as the cheese was too cold
The monkfish was disgusting
I told them to cancel what I had planned for dessert and they brought out a candle on a plate
How pathetic! Needless to say we went to our favorite French restaurant for his REAL birthday dessert, (a perfectly balanced apple tartin)
My fiance took me here for a our anniversary
what a treat
It is a great neighborhood place - service was friendly
Prices were quite reasonable
And the food
so good
We had the meat and cheese apps, which were tasty
And the pizza was delicious
Thin crust was great and the toppings worked so well
A warm friendly place I would reccommend
We will definitely be back
We ordered the assortment of cheeses and meat as an app
which was ok
I ordered the Sunday special which is a pork dish
They basically brought out a whole pig on a plate
I'm not kidding! Everyone was joking that I ordered the Big 96er from that movie the Great Outdoors
All I could think about was John Candy shooting off the Bear's ass with the lamp
The cut was even undercooked in some spots
I think our host was a little embarrased
I'm glad I wasn't hosting a client
I didn't really make a big deal of it, but I was disappointed
C'mon guys, you can do better than that!!!
I won't lie -- pizza was good -- but go only if that's all you want -- and anyway you can find lots of good pizza in the city
The rest was lousy and overpriced
I had the special pork on Sunday -- for $22 I got tough, crummy cafeteria food
I sent it back
They offered to get me a new entree, but since it had taken almost an hour to receive our original entrees (they explained we were behind a large party -- so??), I didn't want to wait for a replacement
They gave us free desserts -- very nice of them, but the desserts weren't very good
Perfectly nice service -- lousy food, overpriced
Dont know why people have complaints
The food is amazing
the grilled pizzas are all incredible and trust me on this one--try the grilled calamari
the actual waiter service isnt amazing but the water was refilled repeatedly without asking and the food came fairly quickly
my friends took me here for a birthday dinner
everything we had was absolutely delish! we split a bunch of the little dishes, pizza w/ arugala and proscuitto and the scrumptious lasagna!!! the whole experience was a delight!
Seeing this on a recommendation list just show what is happens when out of town transplants invade NYC displacing everything that was good about the Big Apple
To even call this place a pizzeria is a joke
This is the kind of stuff you find in a mall in Cleveland
But what do you expect from people who have send there life eating sauce out of a jar
Go get a real slice for Christs Sake

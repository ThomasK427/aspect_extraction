We went to eat after a play, I was very impressed with the food and the very warm attitude of the staff
the waiters took time o explain and talk , but did not hoover over you and make you feel uncomfortable
My wife I are first generation Italian Americans and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience
I've been to La Locanda twice
about a year apart, and it was great both times
The most recent time, we were served by a very passionate waiter who provided a very appropriate amount of service and excellent recommendations on food and wine
Go there! It's a great place that is relaxing and not over-crowded
Went to La Locanda last night with a group of coworkers and it was a fantastic experience
Our waiter was friendly and the service was unmatched
It's not easy to satisfy a large party but at La Locanda they make it seem like cake
The food was absolutely delicious and I recommend going there anytime you're looking for a pre-theater dinner or something in the west-midtown area
I'll definitely be back
I live in the neighborhood, and was looking for somewhere new to hang-out when I stumbled across La Locanda
How fortunate for me
It was a Friday night, a lively crowd, the tables were full, the energy was high
I sat at the bar, ordered drinks, a terrific tuna carpaccio, an excellent seafood entree followed by great espresso
The energy of the place never flailed, and the service couldn't be faulted for its professionalism and friendliness
As a first time customer, they made me feel welcome and right at home, which guarantees my return
Much more a neighborhood crowd than a tourist/theater crowd, and the warmth of the ambience reflects that
We have been going to this restaurant for the past year and it is one of our favorites--and we have dined as some of the best
The chef and host/server (Maximiliano) are co-owners from Italy
You cannot get more authentic
For the reviewer that complained that the chef would not serve contrary to the authenticity of his dish -- that should be a compliment to the chef! His dishes are very unique and delicious
The specials amazing
must try the gnocchi with oxtail
Highly, highly recommend this restaurant
My husband, mother (85), daughter and I had a unique experience at La Cantina Toscana last week
My husband wanted to try a new dish (pasta with shrimp and asparagus) and I ordered a pasta with porcini mushrooms
When we received our meals, I received the wrong entree but kept as I didn't want to delay our meal
Finding the taste of the asparagus overpowering in his dish, my husband requested some cheese for his pasta
Not only was the request ignored by the owner but when reissued, we were told that he would never serve cheese with this dish - he was being true to his origins
There were only two others in the restaurant - while other establishments in the neighborhood were standing room only
After this experience, we understood why so few were in the restaurant
It's amazing there were any!
Having just returned from vacation in Firenze, I was shopping at a store near this restaurant and happened upon it! What luck
It is very small and I felt as if we were back in Tuscany
My mouth was watering reading the menu, so we entered
We shared a bottle of Chianti very good choice
I had a venison ragu over fresh pasta that was supurb
I split a sampling of homemade wild boar sausages over cannellini beans another good choice
My companion had the fresh fish of the day served in a parchment paper with steamed veggies, fresh and tender
Dessert we split a chocholate soufle, great but not low cal! They have lots of specials
We will definitely become regulars
The restaurant looks quaint and inviting from the street
they have an interesting menu with a variety of wild game dishes - ex: wild boar etc along with your more traditional dishes
Server had a bit of an attitude when told that the calamari didn't taste fresh
sent back dish and they took it off the bill
There are too many restaurants to try to go back here again but if wild game is your thing - go for it
have always had a great time here
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine
great neighbhorhood spot
I wish the Citysearch restaurant guide let you give negative ratings! Surely, Le Gamin would rate a negative 10
The staff and manager obviously learned their Frenchiness from the last scene of Monty Python and the Holy Grail
You might be lucky enough to hear your waiter say, May I take zee order from you, Pig Dog, while you're there
That is, assuming that they even decide to take your order in the first place
Le Gamin specializes in the pouty, self-absorbed, narcissistic attitude that makes the whole world hate the French- and makes New Yorkers love to be abused by them
I got used to ordering in from Lemongrass UWS when I worked uptown and always liked it for what it was: cheap good junk food
Since taking a new job at 33rd Street I figured I'd try the one around the corner
The food was positively inedible
They add water to the sweet sour sauce to cut costs
The noodles were a rubbery, tasteless mess
I took two bites and threw the mess in the garbage
I definitely have realistic expectations of this chain--I know it's just cheap junk food--but the stuff they brought tonight was just awful
I love thai food and this is probably the best outlet out of all
I always go for the regular Pad Thai or Drunken Noodles
I love the atmosphere and the service is friendly unlike the rude service in other americanized thai places (like Sea) Not to mention that there is this hot exotic waiter, wears glasses, name Chuck who I think is Thai ;)
Pad See Ew is awesome! Great pad thai too
Well-priced for what you get
i LOVE thai food and found the place by accident
a friend was taking me to dinner for my birthday and said he recalled this place around 96th bway that had great chicken
i was skeptical but he is a picky eater and i am flexible
long story short he meant the place next door but WE BOTH LOVED the food
the portions sized were huge and it was affordable
it was a great b-day surprise
This place is a nice late nite place to chill
They close pretty early, but the owners are friendly and will drink with you as long as you want
When they close the doors the top shelf liquor and shots can come out
Martini's are 7 bucks, but stick with the wine
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does, but it should
The food is great and the prices are reasonable
It is deli style meaning you pick out from a large array of foods and have it weighed
The place is clean, and if you like soul food, then this is the place to be! You'll see a lot of people eating there after church
I love the smoothies at this place
I work on 42nd Street and a cold smoothie is the perfect lunch! Please open a location downtown near my house!!!
I've been stopping in almost every day since I've moved into the neighborhood last month
They have everything you could want and it's all healthy and delicious! The juices are really great -- I love the Generation Sensation
Lived in Hell's Kitchen for about 4 years and have always loved this place
They have had the same friendly staff since I moved here and the produce always looks very clean
I usually only drink the fresh juices and wheatgrass but my office manager loves the Protein Buzz smoothie
I also recommend the wonderful Cold Warrior green tea drink
They offer it both hot and cold, but I prefer hot
Overall this is the best juice bar I have visited and one of the few here in the city to offer fresh squeezed watermelon juice (which is SOOOO good on a hot day!)   Thanks Juice Generation!!!
I love this place! The drinks are amazing, the food is healthy and the atmosphere is cool
It's got to be the cleanest fast food place in all NY
I highly recommend the green tea drinks
I've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block
This is a real gem of a place
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices
While the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had! Try the Watermelon Lemon Drop or Mr
Greengenes - so good!! If I want a light lunch, they fill me up - but I have tried the sandwiches too

We weren't seated until 8:45
in a claustrophobic back room
No apologies, no drinks, no desserts
nothing
It was my mothers 70th birthday and I had also requested a candle on her dessert
Didn't happen
I asked to speak to the manager
Didn't happen either! It was the worst restaurant experience I've had in 7 years in NY
Stay away!
We went to Wolfgangs for my husband's 32nd birthday
I made reservations well in advance for 2 people at 9 pm
We arrived a little before 9 and were not seated until 9:45
No apology, no update as to why we were waiting, no nothing
I am pregnant and neither of us drink so the bar was not an option
The food was really good, but it took a long time for the food to come out after we ordered
Overall, the restaurant was just o
k
and not necessarily worth the wait
I recently brought my husband here on a Monday evening for his birthday dinner
We were seated 45 minutes after our reservation
Furthermore, they were sitting other people who had arrived later etc
At one point they even called our name but then the host saw some other people at the bar and sat them instead!! Once we were seated we found all the food totally mediocre (we had the porterhouse)
For the price I recommend going elsewhere
I would not return even if they offered me a free meal
On March 29th I tried to make a reservation for two people on May 5th at 6:30 for two people
They will not take reservations for two people between the hours of 5:30-8:30pm
The reservationist said they turn the tables of two into tables of four in hopes to get larger parties
I dont understand why a restaurant would turn away a party of two who would probably spend more money than the average table of three
I wonder if all the tables are actually utilized from 5:30-8:30 or if they end up having empty tables
It's a bad policy if you want my opinion
We went to wolfgangs steakhouse and we were disappointed
The salad was too small for $11, even thought the dressing was good
The steak for two, which we asked to be cooked medium was burnt and dry
The french fries were average
Then we had the creme brulee for dessert and it was stale, not fresh
I enjoyed my experience at Wolfgang's immensely
The restaurant was quite busy, however we sat at the bar and enjoyed a drink, the bartender was very pleasant and helpful
As soon as our party was there we were immediately seated
The service was excellent, Wolfgang himself was there, and the food was outstanding
We particularly enjoyed the mushrooms side dish, the steak was perfectly cooked, and this group of Luger fans was very pleased
What is the point of offering reservations if you aren't going to honor them? We had a 7:30 reservation and weren't seated until 8:15
What is that? 45 minutes? Unacceptable
The food is very good for what it is, but it's a steakhouse, so it's nothing spetacular
At the end of the day, it just isn't worth having to spend all this extra time and money at a crowded, loud bar, that you didn't intend to spend
I won't be going back -- too many other good places in town that respect your reservation
Of all the times to try out a restaurant, I went on New Year's Eve
They were serving their regular menu (only complaint was that the selection of beer was pretty slim)
Our reservation was for 8pm and we sat by 8:20, which is great in my opinion
Our waiter was very attentive and helpful
We ordered the porterhouse for four and it was possibly the most delicious steak I have ever had
The service was so great that there wasn't one thing we needed to ask for after we ordered
Yes they served you very quickly, but we were able to sit and chat forever after we finished our meal AND the waiters were all wearing New Year's stuff and handing it all out to the tables
at only 9:30! It made the experience even better and we walked out of there unbelievably happy with the whole experience
had a 7:30; sat at 8:45
they have no clue how to run reservations
or they do it on purpose to get you to spend at the bar
either way; not right for such a pricey restaurant
once seated service was good; steak was good but equal to any other better steakhouse that doesn't make you wait
cream spinach rocked! overall; would not go back
there are other places!
The only cut of steak you should eat at either Wolfgangs or Lugers is the porterhouse
That's their specialty, that's it
If you are ordering filet mignon, or ribeye go somewhere else
The eating experience revolves around the porterhouse and is what makes them famous
Better than Palm, Old Homestead, Angelo Maxies, Wolfgangs compares to Lugers
The wait staff (well Mario) at Wolfgang's was courteous, attentive and top of that polite
I was kind of dissapointed
Part of the fun of eating in a NY steakhouse is the brashness of the waiters
IT IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE! Stop being so sensitive and uptight, learn to make quick decisions and actually experience life at a NYC pace
It is very noisy
Don't like noise? Bring a bigger group
Decor is fancy, not like Lugers which is more turn-of-the-century authentic
Finally they accept credit cards, a HUGE plus over Lugers
Wolfgang's boasts good steaks, a small but decent wine list, and an interesting dining room
However, the service was inexplicably rushed, considering the number of empty tables
Equally puzzling was the manager's insistence on making our party wait, after the hostess informed us our table was ready upon our arrival
Manager was pretentious, unapolgetic, and VERY unaccomodating, and he is the sole reason Wolfgang will not get our business again
There are too many steakhouses in NYC to justify his poor treatment of our party
I fully agree with an earlier reviewer with respect to the lack of responsiveness by the staff
Not only did I call twice, I wrote a letter to Wolfgang personally requesting a group reservation and I never received a response
Our family always celebrated my son's birthday at Peter Lugers and we had Wolfgang as our waiter several times
This year we wanted to try Wolfgang's Steakhouse
I called and wrote several weeks in advance
When I asked about the letter, the manager didn't know anything about it
He was inconsiderate, uncaring, and just couldn't be bothered
This is no way for a new restaurant to treat new customers
I'm going back to the old reliable and still the best Peter Luger
Excellent for business lunches and dinner
My associates and I have been there several times since it has opened
We enjoyed every meal
The following are recommended, the Filet, tomato and mozzarella salad, lump crabmeat salad, sauteed onions and mushrooms (as a side)
Wait staff is always attentive and professional
Like the Post House, this is a steakhouse you take your parents to
It's not better than Luger's, but it beats heading out to Williamsburg it's better than 75% of the steakhouses in Manhattan
$86 pp for 3 people (apps for 2, porterhouse for 2, a ribeye, 2 sides, 2 desserts, coffee, 2 drinks) is a deal vs
the $100 I typically pay for a decent steakhouse meal
Stick with the porterhouse- it's the reason to go
The Canadian bacon was tasty, as were the creamed spinach, German potatoes apple strudel with whipped cream
My only main complaint is the unnecessary hassle getting a decent time for a reservation vs
the # of empty tables (most set for bigger groups) in the surprisingly small, main dining room

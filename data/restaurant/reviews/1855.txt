On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price
But Im sure this was just an honest mistake
the fish was fresh -- cut small, that i didn't mind, but there wasn't that much variety in my sushi/sashimi plate
i wasn't very impressed
i would just get omakase next time
but service was very attentive and we were seated in a cozy, cute gazebo-type booth in the middle of the restaurant
i didn't realize waiting 1
5 hrs was considered prompt seating
nor do they take reservations
needless to say, any reasonable person would forego the wait and dine elsewhere, like i did
this is nyc
great sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen
not to mention the attitude of the clientele
want to act famous, do something famous first, you daft cows!
Went here last night with my husband and another couple
They do not accept reservations and the wait was 1
5 hrs- very worth it! Sushi was extremely fresh, well presented and served within a good time frame
We ordered a very nice selection and it was all nicely spaced- 2 hours of continuous eating and sipping some very good sake!Will defintely return!
Not very good value and not the best sushi I had
There is too much hype about this restaurant
1 o'clock in the morning
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi
then this might be the place
the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin
great service
good sake selection
Super fresh sushi
Great decor
Somewhat pricey though
and be ready to wait a few hours if you show up on Friday or Saturday night, as the place takes no reservation
It is not uncommon for them to take your name down and have you come back two hours later
the food is worth the wait though!
Waited 40 minutes for seating of two at 8PM
The lounge area was nice as we drank a few beers during our wait
The place was crowded and a little cramped
Ambience was okay
Crowd was trendy
Although the sushi was fresh, I was disappointed with the size of the portions for the price
After my fiance and I found out that Jewel Bako had lost our reservations (punks), I made the decision to go to Blue Ribbon instead
We arrived at 7pm, and we only had to wait until 8, but the best part was they took our cell phone number so we could walk around SoHo until our table was ready
The service and food were outstanding, and the green tee creme brulee for dessert was perfect
We'll be there again, for sure
The room is very welcoming at all hours of the night
No trouble getting a seat at the sushi bar
The menu has all of the traditional rolls and fish selections (even split between East and West coast varieties) along with some super special rolls
Beer and wine olny, but great selection of sake
Great, easy going service
just the right amount of attention
You can even go late night like I did and sit next to Jennifer Aniston at the bar
Daytime dining experiences are never great, but after midnight, Blue Ribbon turns from a pumpkin into ball gown Cinderella
The a la carte sushi / sashimi is good, with an excellent selection--but if you're hungry, go for the rolls, since the cuts aren't enormous like they are at, say, Yama or Tomoe
(In other words, it's about the correct, traditional size cut
) It also has good miso soup, which seems to be highly unusual even at high end Japanese restaurants in this city
It's a nice place to kick back, friendly, laid back and non-snooty
The service is just-right attentive, neither neglectful nor overbearingly hawkeyed
Overall, it's a winner
Maybe the hot food is ok, but the sushi was a huge disappointment in tiny, falling-apart pieces
The so-called spicy rolls completely lack any flavor or spiciness whatsoever
Yuck
The Blue Ribbon one block south on Sullivan is sooo good
So is the W
Villlage location and the one in Brooklyn
Blue Ribbon Sushi, however, is a different story
Better sushi can be found just about anywhere
Service is really awful
Wood benches are pretty uncomfortable
The scene is not terribly interesting
So, why exactly would anyone want to wait for 2 hours for a table?
I love the idea of eating top notch sushi at 2am
The place is very inconspicuous
I walked right on by it the first time I went there
Very trendy vibe going on inside
I also liked the fact the server explained each and every kind of fish and where it was from, etc
when serving it
Try the chawan mushi, it tastes just like what mom used to make
I don't come into the city too often, and when I do I mostly eat at Steak Houses, or Italian Restaurants, a friend told me to try Blue Ribbon, but after eating sushi back home in Jersey I wasn't too sure I'd like it any better
Blue Ribbon Sushi in SOHO completley BLEW ME AWAY, I have never in my whole life had food that good before! The waitress explained why the menu is split into different oceans and different seasons, and gave me some great samples of a lot of different types of sashimi, sushi, and Japanese entrees
I had Milk Fish, 8 types of Tuna, Silver Clam, Oysters, King salmon, Sardines, Lobster, Arctic Char, Horse Mackerel, Jelly Fish, even Grouper which was the most suculent I've ever had
It was wonderful!  For dessert I had a Green tea Crembule' and the price was not that bad for NY
If you like sushi, which I do, you are doing yourself an injustice to go here
I have never had sushi with grass in it, nor have I ever had to pick out pieces from the sushi roll
The sushi was totally overpriced for what it was, and I left completely unsatisfied
I finally had dinner there and loved it
The oysters were fresh and delicious, the sashimi and rolls were great
I think the menu has something for everyone and the staff is very polite and helpful
Must try!
I love this place!! For you sushi experts and Japanese food lovers this is a great place to go to
It is important to keep in mind that this place is very expensive but I believe that everything is worth the price
You should ask the waiter (who are all very knowledgeable) on recommendations
Reading the above ratings, I can see that if you like westernized sushi or accostumed to places like Terriyaki Boy, this place is not for you
If you can tell a succelent piece of raw fish from simple texture then you don't your sushi and shouldn't be wasting your money on it
Also, the other seafood dishes are constantly changing and very innovative but you aren't going to find a creative sushi roll that restaurants often do when they run out of ideas
First off, let me say that when it comes to Sushi/Sashimi I am not in the mood ever for trendy B
S
That means no Bond Streets, no Jewel Bako's, and no Brasseries serving Sushi
I love Tomoe, Yama, and to a lesser extend Sachi, but there is only one place that blows me away every single time, and blows away everyone I take here for supper
Blue Ribbon Sushi is quite simply an institution, and at 7 years, she's still got everyone captivated
It's late June so, Copper Pike, Grey Crab, Indian Shrimp, and Salmon Toro are ripe for superior sashimi, a Daikon Salad, and an inventive roll called the Blue Ribbon special, consisting of Lobster, Caviar, Yellow Tail, Avacado, Nigiri, and Wasabi
Every time it's something different, and I mean that

It can get a little noisy and packed, but what do you expect from a place with such amazing food?
Really good, cheap thai food
They have a couple of chains UES and DT and the food is always good and service is great
My first time at Spice was this past weekend
The food was excellent, and so was the Thai ice-tea ($3)
Highly recommend trying it
Entres averaged between $9 and up to $13 for duck
It's a cool place with a nice atmosphere
I'd also recommend trying Sea Thai in the East Village
If I'm in the neighborhood I'll try them again
Get the LemonGrass chicken! Mmmm
and go for the lunch weekday menu, the entries are around 7 dollars and they come with delicious appetizers
Yum yum The interior is quite stylish
Where do I start
I lived right around the corner when this place opened and became a regular
Every single item on the menu is amazing
After eating there, you leave feeling energized
I highly recommend any of the curry dishes, especially the red chicken curry
The emerald dumplings are an amazing appetizer
The staff is very friendly, efficient, and accomodating
It's one of the most exuisitly modern designed restaurants in New York
My favorite place to eat in New York City
The food was affordable, and absolutely delicious
I have eaten a lot of Thai in the city but I enjoyed this one the most
Definitely recommended! It is a bit crowded but worth the food
My best friend took me here for my birthday
I left very happy
The food was fresh and delicious, the staff was super friendly and cute, and the decor was trendy and eye- catching
I recommend Singha beer and the TEMPURA CHEESCAKE it was the best desert I've ever had! can't wait to go back!
Yeah
Manhattan can compete again wih W'burg's Planet Thai
Spice offers really great Thai food for great prices
It is so good that it is the first place where I ever liked Tofu !! (Thanks to Tofu Rama)
You can't get such great Thai food for these prices elsewher in Manhattan
Try it out if you don't mind to smell a little bit like Thai kitchen after your visit
A friend and I were walking around the NYU area and noticed a trendy little restaurant on Univesity Place
The place looked expensive because of it's euro/pop art decor, but it really wasn't! I think the most expensive entre on the dinner menu is under $15
Plus, all of the portions are huge!  Though the music is a bit loud, the enviornment is great :) I'm definitely going back!
It's small and cramped, the chairs are very unconfortable, and it's way too loud, but if you're just looking for an inexpensive place to eat, and not a new your restaurant experience, then this is your place
Best deal: LUNCH MENU! Get a very decent porition of many of their favorites from the main menu, plus an appetizer, for under $8!
A friend of mine recommended this place
Unfortunately he didnt mention that I should bring ear plugs with me
The place is loud, food is greasy and the staff ignorant
There are much better places in the area, such as Republic (and its not even half as loud)
Great food, nice ambiance, not expensive at all
about $9-$12 average per dish
Appetizers are super cheap too
I recommend the Curry Puffs!
If you don't mind eating great thai food in a schnazzy ambience with a hop hip lunch crowd, then come on over to SPICE
the food is plentiful and delicious, the service attentive, the attitude non-existent, and the price phenomenal
For under $7, nothing can beat this
This is a great place to get dim sum the real way, as in not ordering from a menu, but picking delicious dishes from a cart
Both the food and the atmosphere reminded me of getting dim sum in Hong Kong
It's in a less tourist-ladden part of Chinatown, and the prices are reasonable
When I went with a group of 3, it was $10 a person
My only caveat would be to vegetarians: keeping true to authentic Hong Kong dim sum, Sunrise makes few dim sum dishes that have absolutely no meat in it
I went here for Chinese New Years with a group of people
The food was delicious and when we arrived our tables were all set up and reserved
The service and food was great!!! You can't do any better
Plus, we all left and had all only spent $20 each (which included a few rounds of drinks)
I live around Lincoln Center, and Sushi A Go-Go is one of the best places to get sushi! It's fresh, and the service is great! At some points I feel as if the lighting might be a bit bright for my liking, but that's the only downfall! I especially like that they use brown rice for their sushi too! Everyone is friendly, no faults here!
I was attracted to this sushi bar when I saw the owner on GoodDay NY
He was soooo
cute, that I had to go
I was disappointed that he wasn't working that evening, but I was with my boyfriend and I guess it was for the best
The sushi was great, the manager was great, he recommended a sake that I that was sooo
good! The music made me want to just dance
It is a must, without the hefty tab
Loved it!
I was watching Tony Danza and saw one of the most entertaining chefs I have ever saw cook on the show
He has a restaurant across from Lincoln Center, so I made my way this past Saturday, and was extremely disappointed that he was not there that evening
The waitress was so helpful and accomodating
The sake list was small, but good
The sushi was excellent, fresh and wonderful
I had a great time, and the waitress assured me that he would be there the next time
He was soooo cute, I will definitely be back
I saw the owner of this restaurant on the Fox5 morning show
He was so entertaining that I made a point to goinng there that evening
Unfortunately he was not there, but the restaurant was terrific
The sushi was very fresh, the accomodated my guest special request, in fact they even offered some selections with brown rice
Although cold that evening, I was pleased to see a wonderful outdoor cafe, which I hope to frequent when it becomes warmer
I definitely recommend this wonderful Japanese restaurant
One word of surprise, that owner I saw on Fox, is definitely not Asian, but don't let that delay you from trying
I had frequented this establishment two years ago whne going to Lincoln Center
It was disappointing
I have recently retuned three times, and it has been fabulous
The sushi is extremely fresh, very reasonable, and the place is alot of fun
It can be crowded, but it is great for people watching
It has a great outdoor cafe, and I love their drinks
I eat alot of sushi, some compare with the quality, but I am hard pressed to find one that is as much funa dn reasonable
Wow, what great fun I had the other evening
This restaurant has such a whimsical decor and terrific music
I am in my mid 50's and this was MY music
What was even better, the food! The sushi was unpretentious, very fresh and also great fun
I was even amused to find out that the restaurant was owned by a renowned Italian-American Chef
the fun just doesn't stop
Only draw back that I found was that they don't accept reservations, although I am always seated promptly
I must of passed by this little jewel a dozen times
Hidden away in Lincoln Center is a great sushi bar
The sushi was great, really fun decor, very friendly service, groovy 60's music and terrific value

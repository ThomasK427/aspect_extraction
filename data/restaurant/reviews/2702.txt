After another 20 minutes the other came out
Strangely enough all the regulars that he was talking to got there meals in 1/2 hour
The guy was pleasant and friendly but that only goes so far when you are hungry and have to wait 2 hours for a pizza
My recommendation is only go there if you know someone in the family
This place was fantastic
Mario, the owner, was the only waitstaff on duty and was the best
The decor is bizarro grandparent basement; sometimes hilarious, sometimes thought provoking, sometimes spooky and puzzling
The minnestrone was so-so, but the pizza rivals Grimaldis or anywhere else
Great crust char, mild sauce, and spicey pepperoni
Plus, they are the only restaurant I have ever been in with Coke and Pepsi so both my girlfriend and I can be happy! Absolutely no slices, and if you want to use the can without a meal, better cough up the two bones
Everything we order is always great
Lou makes a mean Martini
The best pizza we have ever had! The decor is homey (I still don't know why a photo of a cat is on the wall)
Lou will help you decide, sort of
Just go! And forgodsakes don't ask for a slice of pizza!
Sam's is simply delicious
Their bolognese sauce can't be beat, and their stuffed peppers are the best in the world
The waiters are helpful, funny, and friendly
And the pizza is not to be missed
With lots of TVs, the game you want to watch is always on
The food here is great (I've never had a bad meal here)
Staff is extremely friendly and laid back
The crowd really gets into the games which makes is more fun
Definitely recommend!
This a nice neighborhood pub
Good place to catch a game and have a few rounds
Great Buffalo chicken sandwich
Cousins II offers a wide variety of dishes at an affordable price
Friday Night Karakoe is the best in the city
The mix of customers makes it a fun place to be on Friday nights
I work in the area, and frequently call this place for soup
Many, many interesting varieties
Sandwiches are good, if small and their fresh tossed salads are well worth it!
The Victory is a great little corner spot where local folks drop in for their caffeine fix and a bagel, empanada or other nibbly treat
The owner, Patrick, is very welcoming, warm and accomodating to all
A great place for a pick-me-up with a great view of all the dogs and locals in the 'hood
The coffee is great and so are the tunes if you decide to stay inside and hang with Patrick and his gang
Highly recommended!
With so many ultra trendy restaurants in the neighborhood, the St
Claire is the only real diner in town
Typical diner menu, fast service, and good people
You won't be dissappointed
On a not so busy Saturday night, awful service is one thing
Terrible food on top of bad service is inexcuseable
One person's dinner was cold, another was charged for a larger portion than ordered, and my shrimp pasta was inedible
Though I generally find food on Montague street to be overpriced and mediocre, I decided to give this restaurant a try
I don't reccomend you do the same! Yuck!
I really enjoy eating here
We had very friendly service and the food was delicious
Two of us could eat a full meal with two desserts and a salad for $40
Maybe the other member went on an off day
I ate here with a friend from out of town a few weeks back and I am still in shock by this place
The owner walks around barking at his employees every chance he gets, and makes everyone----customers and staff----nervous
Our waitress was practically in tears by the time our food arrived
My friend's entree wasn't presented as described in the menu, but we didn't want to add to the drama
We ordered the more chardonnay at $6 a glass, and it came to us in mini caraffes----to pour into our glasses---like it was some highly regarded wine world over
Don't go there----it's a pathetic excuse for a restaurant
Eating outdoors in Brooklyn Heights is a treat
The food was decent and so was the service
They did an ok job for being understaffed
this is one of the moderate outdoor dinging restaurants on Montgue Street
But the moderate food and service is worth it if you are interested in finding a spot for relaxing in one of the most historical neighborhoods in Brooklyn
Not much good here, at all
Though the service is quite good, it does not make up for the less-than-average food and the smell of old wood that greets you as you enter
Lots of work to be done!
This place has the best pork chops I have ever eaten
It's one of their dinner specials, so call beforehand if you really want them
The pastas are also excellent
I like the atmosphere as well
Definitely a good date place as well
Outrageous California Burrito - steak, everything on it, extra sour cream and a glass of cool horchata
Do yourself right and treat yourself to a real hearty meal
Every time I visit Mom Dad in Brooklyn, I always stop here for a Chicken burrito
They have never let me down; they're huge!! Unlike other Mexican places I've been to, the chicken is shredded--moist and in a delicious sauce--and the rice is tasty, and the right texture
Their Super Quesadillas with Chicken are also fabulous--nice, thick and tasty
The pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream that usually accopanies (if you request it) it, are a wonderful plus
And their prices haven't changed one bit during the 10+ years I've been going there
Great food (especially pasta) at Caffe Carciofo in Cobble Hill
The pappardelle with lamb ragu is wonderful! Lots of reasonable daily specials featured as well
Sidewalk caffe in warm weather gives a nice view of busy Court Street
Only drawback here is cash only, but the friendly staff should keep you happy
The first time was a pleasure, the second time with the company of 10 people was a pure delight
The selections of wine were plentiful
The appetizers and main dishes were a complete success
The homemade desserts made the entire evening a pleasure
It is one of the best places to eat on Court Street
With the ever changing menus and the delicious brunches, you will fall in love with this place
If you have never been there, you need to go today
In the sea of Smith Street hipster places, Carciofo will never disappoint
The specials here are the best, especially the pasta dishes
Always fresh and always delicious, they are like what your roomate might throw together for you from stuff in the kitchen, if your roomate was in culinary school and the stuff in your kitchen was fresh mozzarella, red peppers, and arugula
Carciofo is what family-style Italian should be: delicious and affordable
Go for the specials at this restaurant - the salads and appetizers of the day are typically fresh and presented well
The service is good, if brusque at times
The last time I went on a Friday and had a steak special that just about sent me over the moon it was that good
What's with the cash only, though - that is a bit tired in this day and age
And my one brunch experience was not so great - harvest is a better deal
In the end though, one of the best in the neighborhood - and it refreshingly lacks the pretension that characterizes a good portion of its smith street competition
The Scene The minimal street signage keeps crowds down, but Brooklyn Heights locals know to seek out this coveted spot
The comfy, antiques-filled dining room has butter-yellow walls, dark-wood fixtures, and a peaceful but merry air

We had to continually remind the waitress to give us our bill, and the service was slow
The Scene Though this hole-in-the-wall remodeled a few years ago, don't go expecting nuevo-East Village swank
It still looks like a tiny diner with a few sombreros thrown on the walls
Service can be a little pokey, so entertain yourself with some Avenue A street theater at one of the sidewalk tables outside
The Food Though the revamped decor may not catch your eye, you'll certainly take notice of the menu
Start with a plate of nachos, served in authentic style with each chip individually smothered; don't forget a side of spicy guacamole
Tacos and burritos are fine, but the platters are what make La Ceiba special
Standouts include the camerones enchilados, plump shrimp served in a tangy red-pepper sauce, and the super-flavorful, not-too-greasy chilies rellenos
we went here on one of our first dates and have been back a couple times
but after last night, never again
we waited over half an hour for a menu- which we had to get up and ask for ask for
waited for water- which we had to get up and ask for
food came relatively quickly
was decent
waited over half an hour for the check, which never came
so we left what we thought was the bill and left
by this time, we were the only patrons in the bldg besides one other table of 2
they never even checked on us once
the staff prefers to watch TV in the main dining room infront of their waiting customers then serve their customers
all recurring problems
don't even bother
This is by far the tastiest Mexican place in the city
The ambiance is not the greatest, but the food is sooo good you end up not caring
It's inexpensive and friendly and a great place to go on a Friday night after a movie
They have the best fajitas I've ever had
Everyone should try their special nachos! Unbelievable
I was in the mood for a margarita and I thought what better place to go to than a mexican restaurant, right? Wrong! I have never tasted a margarita so bad
And that wasn't even the worst part
I took one sip and realized how awful it was and politely tried to send it back and order something else, but the servers were extremely rude and insisted I pay for the horrible, untouched margarita anyway
I just could not believe how rude they were! Needless to say, I will not be going here ever again and would advise everyone else to do the same
I go here all the time and the food is always good
Its tasty and not drowning in cheese like those other mexican places
(i
e
maryannes which i think is a horror)
La Ceiba is also amazingly cheap
The service isnt always the most attentive but they are always friendly
Ive taken many different friends there and they all go back and recommend it to others
Im from south texas and used to good mexican food
This is one of the very few places in nyc that i enjoy going back to
This place is authenticly poor
We waited 15 minutes just to get water
We waited 45 minutes for our meal, we got up and walked out
The place is under-staffed, have eaten there before, the food is not that good
Go to Maryannes, better service, better food
Not much to say
just plan ole joint with excellent authentic Mexican food
For all you left coasties who complain about the Mexican in NYC, this is the place for you
bare minimum decor
but great food
neighborhood spot
The Scene Named after the Moroccan port where Orson Welles filmed parts of his "Othello," this darkly lit, vividly painted couscous cafe manages to evoke both North Africa and the East Village
The crowd dresses with a studied grunginess that wouldn't be out of place in Tangiers
The Food All the appetizers are excellent here, as good and often better than at other more expensive Moroccan restaurants around town
Ditto the couscous, which comes with large servings of aromatic vegetables and appropriately spicy paste
And great brunch and sidewalk tables make a seat hard to find on weekend mornings
great place for brunch, do come early to avoid too long of a wait, great mediteraennaen dishes
i will recommend this place to everyone who likes exotic food and cool ambience
the price is very reasonnable and the food is really great, i go there at least once a month to get my cucumber yogurt, hummus and my couscous
there is for everybody taste
love it
I've eaten here many times and have always had wonderful experiences
The atmosphere is very cozy and romantic, and the food is delicious! The appetizers are all so good, we usually get several
The tangines and mixed grill are to die for! Always had wonderful service
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I often take friends and family here while they visit
The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is very attentive
As a lover of everything humus and cucumber, there is no other restaurant in the city that compares to Mogador's appetizers
When in the mood for something lighter their kebabs and salads hit the spot and when looking for a more formal diner, their selection of tangines, couscous and grills are delicious - I would recommend the mixed grill for a sample of chicken, lamb and sausage or the Charmoulla (spicy tangine) and there is no way you can skip dessert
The restaurant is usually busy, so plan on waiting for a table during prime dining hours on the weekend, but it is definitely worth the wait
Wonderful experience here! Delicious food- I had the braised lamb with red wine
Our waitress was so friendly and efficient
Desserts are to die for, especially the strawberry rhubarb cobbler
I will definitely go back!
OK, St
Mark's Place has long ago lost it's punks and derilicts and is now filled with latter day imitators, but that I don't give a damn attitude remains in many of the street's establishments
The waitresses refused to look at us here, and boy were they sour acting! You do though get decently (read: nothing exciting, nothing wrong') prepared and inexpensive grilled meats, tagines, and various spreads
The room is bright and uninviting, almost like a fast food place (well
a little cozier than BK)
And if you sit outside, you may even get panhandled by a junkie or a neo-punk (read: a great place to take your parents from Iowa
)
It's so cheap that I go with my friends who are NYU students! The staff is friendly, the food is cheap and the desserts are amazing! Get the tangines or the mixed grill and finish it off with the molten chocolate cake (with some tea, of course)
On Wednesdays they have belly dancing also
ate here on sunday
we had made a reservation (thankfully as the place was packed) and were seated immediately
our table wasn't the best but that's the only negative point i can make
the food was wonderful and completely affordable, the French-speaking waiting staff was very efficient and friendly, the wine we ordered was inexpensive but really good
and you MUST order dessert if you eat here
everything was good
as for the coffee (espresso), it was strong and delicious, authentic French-style strong espresso
The breakfasts are great and very reasonable
Also, it can be very uncrowded and pleasant during the breakfast hours
You won't miss anything if you skip lunch or dinner here, and I wouldn't trust the eggs benedict here (or most places) at brunch, so go for breakfast -- the ratings below reflect the breakfast experience!
I am moroccan and I can say that the food is very bad
It has no taste
THe pastilla was salty, there was no balance between salt and sugar as it should be
It is absolutely nor authentic Moroccan cuisine
Met friends here on a Wednesday night for drinks
Great ambiance and very friendly staff
Food was just ok, but prices were definately reasonable
Would definately head back for drinks again

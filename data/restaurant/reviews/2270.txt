If you don't want to dance or sing or have a great time, go someplace else
But if you want the perfect place to take a bunch of friends and make some noise, book a table at Mangia e Bevi
The food is nothing special (just like at any neighborhood Italian place) but the ambience is a 10
Make sure you tell the waiter it's someone's birthday in your group - even if it's not - because it just adds to the experience
I've made better pasta dishes using a hot pot in my college dorm!! The food was lousy and portions were tiny -- but that wasn't the worst of my experience
We were a bachelorette party of 13 who made a reservation far in advance -- and still we were rushed like you wouldn't believe! By not only the waiter but by the manager!! They actually forced us to leave before serving us our desert
(not that I was looking forward to desert after the crappy dinner
) We were not even there for an hour and a half total!!!  Can't even begin to describe how rudely we were treated!! I'm still furious about the whole event!Save yourself the trip -- this place is waste of time!!!
Worst service ever
Went for a bachelorette party and the waiter brought us the check before he offered us dessert and then explained that we had exceeded the hour-and-a-half that the restaurant had allotted our group to finish our entire dinner
Very rushed and very rude
And the food was unimpressive too
Great place for people who know how to cut loose--not good for those that are uptight
Food is decent, drinks are great, staff is generally nice
Occasional dancing on chairs with tamborines
Lots of laughs
If you go there for a b'ette ask them for a blow job shot
Make reservations ahead of time be prepared for a wait of at least 30 mins from the time your ENTIRE party arrives
I have frequented this place on three seperate occasions with large groups and small and have always found the place to be curious and the food excellent! We had a blast each time! They make a great Apple Martini also! The food was prepared very well and was delicious!! The waitstaff was very attentive until it got overly crowded and explained that it would have to take out whole order at one time so that he wouldn't have to make his way back so many times once the place was packed! Can't say enough good things about it!
If you like bridge and tunnel bachelorette parties and god awful noise with your poorly prepared dinner, served by unattentive and ignorant staff, this is the place for you
The only good thing about this place is that you get plenty of experience sending things back, and hone your negotiation skills when they try to make you pay for something you never got or never even ordered
Also great for those who like to be seated an hour after their reservation
If you're bridge and tunnel and have absolutely no taste in fine italian food AND enjoy morans dancing on tables banging on tamberines to music you'd hear at a basketball game
then eat here
I don't get it
I ate better food in my high school cafeteria
If you want to go somewhere to have a good time, trust me there are soooooo many places other than this hole to go to
It's nosey, tacky and even with reservations they make you wait outside at LEAST an hour
I have nothing positive to say about this place
And I don't think I know of anyone else who does
Great Food, Wine and Singing!!!  Ive heard that its a great place for a b-day celebration and they are right!!!  A Must go
This is a great place for people who want to have fun with their meal - it's not for those looking at a quiet romantic dinner (sitting outside seems like a romantic escape)
Food is great, portions are good, and staff is very knowledgeable
I Had Dinner at Mangia e Bevi Last Saturday and it  Was So Much Fun
First We Got There late for Our so
We Were Asked To Wait For About 10 Minuts And Then The Music Started and Tambourines Were Given to Customers Who Danced and Sang all Together
Dinner Was Exellent-Veal with mushrooms-and the Service was also Very Good
We Will Come Back For Sure
What a great night out! This place has great food, and great atmosphere complete with an endless stream of tamborines and dancing on chairs!! This is for definately those who want an entertaining evening
In Short Ellen's Stardust Diner opened in 1995 as a mock-'50s greasy spoon and not long after that, added its now-famous singing waitstaff
The festive crew serves from a gigantic menu of American classics: chili, burgers, cobb salads, baked potatoes, wings, philly cheesesteaks, club sandwiches, you name it
The rear room is a relaxed jazz space with 185 seats, where diners partake in Times Square dinner theater late into the evening
At 8am on a Friday morning, most little cafes in New York are packed
And with a group of 8, a packed place wasn't an option
We needed something reasonably priced and fast
When we found Ellen's Stardust Diner, the singing waitstaff advertisment scared me a little
But the music didn't sound too bad and the prices were decent, so the group consented
Inside we were treated to an array of Broadway showtunes and, when they weren't singing, a mix of stuff that could have been on Grease or Dirty Dancing
The food wasn't anything to rave about, but it was good
When we were just about finished, I wanted to request the song they had been singing when we found the diner, I'll Cover You from Rent
The two guys working agreed
They came over by our table and sang for us
When they saw I knew all the words to the song, the one put his mic to my mouth and let me sing a little
It was a blast
And I, being a Broadway freak and a total Renthead, had the most fun out of our whole group
These waiters and waitresses, which all look to be college students, aren't just kids off the street
They had to audition to get their job and they have some amazing talent in there
I've never had dinner there, but I've heard it's good
You can even sit at the bar and just have a couple of drinks
If you've got the time to spare, definately check it out
the food was ok
what we really liked about the place was the entertainment
Table of 6, and when 1 person ordered just a milkshake, the waitress said you know there's a minimum order for the table, right? Or else you get charged a fee
The minimum is for a table of six? $30
$5 per person
So if one person only wants a milkshake, (which, btw- costs $6), the rest of us ordering $12 burgers and alcoholic beverages and such will meet 'minimum order
' And then- she didn't bring waters until we were halfway through our food, extra napkins got thrown on the table as she walked by, etc
No checking up on the table
She didn't even bring our food- someone else did, just throwing random dishes in front of each of us, and we sorted it out ourselves
Then the singing waitstaff passed around their tip bucket- we couldn't get water or napkins, but we should tip for the singing?
We had the nicest time visiting Ellen's during our recent trip to NYC
This is one tourist-trap very worth visiting
It's great to watch the waiters/waitresses belting out your favorite tunes, while also serving you your meal
This place is exactly as advertised, full of singing wait staff who aspire to be big in theatre someday while taking your order at the same time
The service was remarkably decent, the prices were a bit more than I expected (then again, you're somewhat paying for the entertainment), the food wasn't anything special, but the singing was quite good
While each waiter/waitress served folks, there was at least someone singing almost Karaoke style random songs that were featured in musicals, broadway plays, and movie soundtracks
I would come back here again, but I don't know if the prices justify it
The restaurant itself features two floors, so you can catch all the musical excitement from ground level and above
Nasty maitre d', apathetic waitstaff, noisy, uncomfortable, and terrible service
Even with our reservations, our party was seated in the cramped corner with not enough chairs or settings
The food came after 10 minutes, and our order was wrong
The servers are confused
Took even longer to get dressing for the salad, and to correct the mistake would have been another 20 minutes
If you don't order a burger, you're on your own for food quality
Must be more interested in the tip jar than serving you
The singing was too loud
The topper was when we mentioned it was chilly at our table, the manager sarcastically blew us off with I'll put another log on the fire
NO WAY would I ever go here again
Very strange previous review about this fun place being too noisy
You go to Ellen's for the entertainment, not for the food
I would have never dreamed of going there for Thanksgiving Dinner on anything of the sort
The food is average and overpriced, but you are paying for the atmosphere and outstanding entertainment by the delightful waitstaff
I plan to take my daughter here for her birthday dinner on our upcoming visit precisely because it is so much fun
She will love it
The waiters are obviously aspiring Broadway stars and make for a delightful up close performance
I trust that many of them will make it to Broadway! I can't wait to go to Ellen's again in just two more weeks! It is a part of my regular New York itinerary
My family and I ate dinner at Ellen's for our Thanksgiving holiday meal (it was recommended by the hotel we stayed at)
As all the reviews stated it is NOISY
It was also very crowded with lots of families
It is a fun atmosphere with the wait staff as aspiring actors/actresses waiting for their turn on Broadway

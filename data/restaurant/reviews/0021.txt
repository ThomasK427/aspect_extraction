I ended up ordering from the regular menu instead of the restaurant week offerings since the options weren't as good as I was hoping
The swordfish was way too salty yet bland
Even the recommended mojitos weren't remarkable
We shared the fruit tart from the restaurant week menu, but didn't like it - the crust was much too thick, masking the flavor of the fruit
All in all, not a place I plan to visit any time soon
A tropic in the concrete jungle, the atmosphere was welcoming, especially on a cold winter night
Everything is as good as it looks on the menu
One of two things must happen for it to be a succesful experience
One, if you are not familiar with ceviche (ing) of food, don't try it for the first time here
It wil be too overwhelming for the virgin palate
Second, be aware that most of the entrees are served as is, meaning you should order a side item if you know will will crave more
The presentation is beautiful
All in all, it is really good with or without sides and extra fixins'
I thought this place was great for dinner
I ahd a late resevation so we were sat quickly and our food was prepared quickly as well
The sangria was strong and the waitress was responsive, I will definitely be returning
After the great reviews here I was expecting something special
Food was good but not worth it (our $15 appetizer ceviche was miniscule) you can get at least as good at other places
Too loud, music was non-descript annoying thump thump thump
Service seemed like they were doing us a favor
This place is trying hard to be hip, but it doesn't seem to have much class
I admit that the rolls were great, but I won't go back
Great food great ambiance- went during restaurant week and odrered off the regular and the 30
04 menus- everything was divine- portions were just right and the seasoning and spices in each dish were unique and well prepared
The service was a little off but the place was packed
We were sat right away with our reservation and never rushed despite the full house
Reasonable prices for Cuban food in the city
calle ocho is definitely high on my list, the food and mojitos are excellent (the sangria is a miss, flor de sol has much better sangria) but the service leaves much to be desired
we were a group of six and it took atleast 45 minutes for our entrees to come! the waitress was not attentive at all and we had to keep getting the attention of the water servers to get more drinks
but the food is excellent and the ambience great
if you can get past the service to pay the top $ its worth a visit!
I had eaten here about a year ago under the old chef and the food was pretty good but nothing special
Last night I attended a large dinner there and was told the kitchen was now headed by Douglas Rodriguez, formerly of Patria
I had eaten at Patria 7 or 8 yrs ago and remembered it as one of the best meals ever(as well as a great room, which it still is), and i can say the same about the new Calle Ocho
I had a fantastic Tuna Ceviche to start and the Cuban hangar steak as an entree which was incredible!!! Unfortunately I was too full for desserts b/c they also looked great
Still love the look and activity of the bar and the dinig room is nice too
Highly recommended and will definitely go back again
Awesome food, atmosphere etc
Mojitos were authentic and great
Service was a little slow and un-atttentive, but that did NOT stop us from enjoying our evening
We went for our anniversary July 2002 and we are flying in and going again July 2003
Look forward to it
Dinner last night at Calle Ocho proved to be anothe roverwhelming experience
We had the new lobster ceviche and the pork shank from Douglas Rodriguez's current menu
I am so happy he is the new man here, now I can stay on the upper west side all the time and have my Latin food whenever I want
I went there planning on driking a lot of sangria, but you too can make this sangria at home; buy a BOX of wine, fill your glass with ice and then pour the wine in
It was the WORST Sangria ever, and their house drink has just a shot of Malibu rum, and at a price of $9 you want more than a shot of a 40% alcohol
Love the layout - cool bar area, good for a date or hanging out w/ friends
The dining hall is grand and luxurious, very nice
The food is also nice - especially the crispy red snapper
It was just perfect! However, this is not really cuban food - much more like cuban inspired nuevo latino i guess
but still very delicious
Lucy and Ricky on the bathroom doors is a plus
We went here for New Year's and it was great
$100 for all night open bar and food
Food was excellent, ambience was nice, music kept us moving, bartenders were quick
The only problem was the dance floor was right next to the food, so you had food/drink all over the place
But they dropped some salt and the party went on
We're definitely gonna be back for dinner
I had a great brunch here with a friend two weeks ago
It was a little overpriced, but there was a ton of food, and it was all delicious
I got the eggs over the ecuadorian potato pancake, which worked really well
Also lovely was the atmosphere; the high ceilings and spacious room make it a nice contrast from the other brunch mills on the upper west side
The food is ok at best and very overpriced
A birthday dinner of 9 people came out to $45 a head!!! Claims to be Latin cuisine, but is not
Very diluted and americanized latin food
If you really want to get nuevo latino food and save some $$$, go to Cabana's
Also, the service isn't up to par
Our waiter was attentive, but the reservationists/hostesses were very unaccomodating
I called to make reservations the day of the dinner, and was told that we weren't able to get a table a good 2 hrs
after the desired time and that we would have a hard time getting a table
But when we got to the restaurant, the place was empty and we didn't have any problems getting a table
Go figure? I'm not going back
The food was very good and the ambience was very inviting
It beat my expectations by a lot
Also, not too expensive given how good the food quality is
Loved it
Cuidado! Mojitos will make you loco!! The best Central American food I've ever seen and tasted
Crowded, but not to an extreme
Definitely a great place for a date
Great ambience
Busy, friendly bar scene-great to meet peple
Noisy, latin club atmosphere with great salsa background
Good drinks, good food
Nice spot for couples, singles or large groups
Lovely setting though a bit noisy
Lobster ceviche was amazing pared with mango
Ditto for the seafood salad and paella
Tried the burnt coconut ice cream which was a great ending to a fantastic meal
I love this place - the bar is a great scene, the food is awesome and the atmosphere is just right for a date or a group of friends
Check out the private round table for big groups - there's a minimum so there has to be a big group
Ideal for bday parties!
My brother wanted to try Cuban food while he was visiting
I've never been to Cuba so I dunno how it is in comparison
What I can say is that I liked the atmosphere a lot
Very lively
I was really excited when our waiter read off the list of specials
Apparently, everyone else was too because when we ordered them, our waiter had to come back to tell us they were out of them
I guess he was too busy looking cool to check to see if the specials were still available
This was somewhat of a disappointment, but I didn't let it ruin my night

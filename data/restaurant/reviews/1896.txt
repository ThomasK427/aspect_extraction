I've been to Bond st
quite a few times and I usually eat right above the bar area
The food is good but it wasn't as good as the amount they were charging
I would go there again yes but not all the time! I can't aford it! If you like your sushi cut large and juicy like
this isnt the place for you
the portions were small food without taste, expensive and crowded
I've never eaten at Bond St's upstairs area
Why? Because the lounge is the best place to take a new date who likes sushi
As with most NY chic spots, its low candle light and awsome music mix make for a great atmosphere
Yeah, the service is not prompt, but I dont go there to eat fast food
Besides, this place is becoming known for the attitude of the staff
In NY, who doesn't have a little?The unique sauces are perfect for the person who likes more than just ginger, wasabi, soy sauce with their sushi
The toro is very good
The eel dishes are very creative
I can't get enough of the warm eel roll with sliced almonds
The warm chocolate desert is surprisingly good too
The staff needs a SERIOUS make over though
They are very obnoxious and snotty -- the lot of them
I went to Bond St
for the first time last night
The food was okay, not bad, it's soso
but the service was terrible! They seemed to have us hurry to get out due to other reservation
I would have ordered more, but then they took our chop sticks as well! The lighting there was too dark to eat too! I couldn't read the menu! I wasn't sure all the $$$ I spent was valuable
Just bunch of snob goes
not really cool
Food: The fish was not terrible, would be fine for a decent neighborhood sushi joint
Chu-toro was a little old, everything else was ok, but NOT WORLD CLASS
Atmosphere: Ok, some people probably like this, but Tone-Loc on the stereo and a rude bartender does not equal hip in my book
Price: A modest dinner for two cost me $130, including tax and tip
It was worth more like $60
I'm not opposed to paying a lot for great stuff, but this was not it
Go with friends you like and simply enjoy the freshest and most delectable sushi
You will be surrounded by a horrible cheesy BT and/or think-they're-cool ibanker crowd but the food is well worth it
Helpful tip: Order all your stuff once you get a waitperson - even ordering your drinks ahead
they seem to disappear into thin air for hours
I know that Bond Street opened in 1997, but I can't shake the feeling that I've time-warped to the Big 80s whenever I'm there: from the sleek-yet-cold decor to the loudmouthed investment bankers seated across from me, everything screams The Me Decade
Which is not necessarily a bad thing
If you're prepared to deal with all the egos (the staff AND the clientele), you can settle in for an enjoyably over-the-top kinda-sorta-Japanese meal
Don't look for too much authenticity from a Japanese restaurant that offers foie gras
Everything lacked salt, and the tab will make you wish Gordon Gekko were footing the bill, but you'll feel important and snazzy for the duration of your meal
And who doesn't need that every now and then?
This is one of my favorite restarants in NYC!! It is especially a wonderful place to bring out of towners to experience NYC and great for large groups
Great lounge
This trendy New York restaurant is a disappointing dining experience, especially when compared to the sushi restaurants I have frequented in this vast metropolis
The food portions are meager and the prices are exorbitant
When I go out to dinner I find pleasure in eating a sizeable meal and paying for what I get
At Bond Street, not only do you leave you still feeling hungry, you also leave feeling cheated - definitely NOT the best bang for your buck!
I love Bond Street; the decor, the drinks, and especially the food
The sushi is not traditional sushi, but if you're looking for something different, it's great
Love the sesame-crusted shrimp roll, lobster tempura roll and spicy tuna roll-they're all served with yummy dipping sauces
Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! My husband refuses to go there ever since we have had rude service from waiters and hosts
I don;t blame him, I was not very happy myself, but he food is so good I can't give it up
If you go, just realize they think they're too cool and give attitude
Had a late reservation
They stuck us at the table up front by the bar and REFUSED to change our seats even though we were willing to wait
The twerpy male host had a MAJOR attitude and refused to accomodate us and the waitress was unwilling to take out order since one person wasn't at the table even though we knew what they wanted
The ashes from people smoking were falling into our food
The food was decent but not worth the prices
The staff needs a dose of reality
The sushi @ bond st
is the best i've had, hands down, but do they have to be so rude-- The hostess wouldn't allow us to save a seat for a late friend (15 minutes), and gave us dirty looks the whole night
Also, right as we finished our meal, the servers took our plates and started setting up while we were still seated--and before the check came
Oh, yeah, we were still hungry when we left--each of us having spent @ least $50
I went there with a friend, and we didn't think that it was anything extraordinary
We got there pretty late, so we didn't have to wait
The sushi was presented very well, but they messed up our order
It's also difficult to eat it because you're bending over these low tables
The sushi was good, but overpriced
Overall, I would recommend it because it's different
But don't expect something out of this world because you'll be disappointed
The descriptive picture for this restaurant does not do this place justice
This place is sexy, sleek and serves designer dishes! The sushi is very fresh and tasty! Off on a side street in Soho, this place is a gem
There are cool places to venture on the Bowery around the corner if you decide to leave after dinner, but who needs to leave when the bar is packed with just enough people
been there a few times-upstairs and lounge
great presentation
delicious,fresh food
great atmosphere
wait staff with attitude-too cool for school
though the host waitress with the long,black hair in the lounge were very friendly and pleasant
Sushi melts in your mouth, fresh fish, perfectly cooked rice
You will not find better sushi in the city
I have been here 4 times
Quality-wise, it's tough to beat
If you are willing to drop a little dough, you can count on quality, melt in your mouth cuts of fish
While I tend to be a fan of rolls, you will certainly be missing the true experience if you pass on trying some of the excellent quality sashimi they have to offer
They get fresh fish on a DAILY basis, and it shows
Overall, I love this place
However, the last time I was there, our waitress was TERRIBLE
By the time our food got there (not too long
after she actually remembered to turn in the order!), I was ready to eat my arm, which obviously compromises the experience
A place of this caliber should be seemless--always
Overall, the sushi is good enough for me to to accept server's bad day
Great food, atmosphere, location, vibe, decor, and service
It's pricey, but it's a great place to go with friends for a special occassion
Especially for those who like sake and sushi
Bar downstairs is great for a pre-meal drink or five
Lots of celebrity sightings too, but it's low-key, which is good
How someone who has actually eaten here and experienced the service can give this place a good rating is beyond me
Perhaps the clientele simply doesn't know a thing about sushi except that it's trendy
The food is absolutely mediocre, with peculiar combinations that bastardize sushi

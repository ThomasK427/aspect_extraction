I still believe it to be sent from the gods! It was an enormous portion, the steak was cooked and presented beautifully, and the sides (I chose good ole' mash potatoes) were right on
Earls is my new williamsburg fav! Drop the lodge guys, the word is out
earls just has better food hands down!
These days South Williamsburg has an influx of new restaurants
I've been doing the Grand Street taste test recently and have to say that the new Earl's Kitchen located at the year old Tainted Lady Lounge is my favorite place to eat these days
The atmosphere is comfortable and the food is excellent
I've eaten everything from the Molasses Marinated Salmon to the Cola Pork Chop to the Southwestern Crabcakes to the Portobello, Goat cheese and Beet spread Sandwich
I've also had them deliver and it was timely and available up until midnight
I'd say if you want a good meal and want an affordable place to eat at regularly go check them out
You won't be disappointed
We had the most fun in this playfully sexy place with naked lady paintings everywhere! The food was amazing and the desserts were sinful! I highly reccommend the pork chops with bourbon sauce , the mac and cheese and the salmon! My date crazy good and I had a slew of fabulous specialty drinks and we were completely satiated (and horny?!) from all the fine food, the crazysexy ambience and the liquor!  Definately a unique place to have a successful date and a culinary experience I would not have expected from this cozy little wacky spot!
Finally South Williamsburg is offering some good eats without all the pretentiousness of all the new restaurants that have been opening recently
Earl's kitchen has the kind of food you can eat everyday not once in a while
All the dishes have their own signature
It's familiar yet different
I've eaten there twice delivered three times and everything is actually really good
From the Corn and Polenta pancakes to the Cola Marinated Pork Chop
I had dinner with my vegetarian friend and the Portobello sandwich with a Beet Goat Cheese Spread was the bomb for her
I love Deb Parker's Tainted Lady Lounge and I am so happy the new kitchen rocks
I stopped in today and tried 3 different half-sized portions of bruschetta ($2 for 1/2, $3
50 for a whole)
They were delicious and piled high with stuff - gorgonzola/walnuts, portabella/fontina and goat cheese/caramalized onions
A tiny place, but cute for a sandwich and a glass of wine
I stopped by the other day for a quick bite and had a fig and proscuitto pannini with tallegio and it was awesome
It was washed down with a bittburger draft beer and it hit the spot! The pannini was served with a generous amount of nicely dressed greens
A great value, but be warned, it is a very small place
This is a cute new place in Park Slope
It serves up delicious gourmet paninis with fabulous ingredients
I like to drop in for lunch on the weekends and ind it to be a great cozy place to fill up on food and wine
Very casual atmosphere
The antipasti platter and the tuna appetizer were great
Cool gastro-pub vibe at a this very accessively priced (read $25 and Under as in glowing New York Times review) eartery adjoining the IFC Center
The Center is a terrific venue for independent and classic films and The Waverly gives it and extra special dimension
How many other theaters have a restuarant that can made a NYC foodie happy attached to them? But you have to know it's there as they don't make ti all that easy to spot, from the street - or the theater!
by far the best in Brooklyn
and for the money, close to the best in all of Manhattan great pieces and interesting rolls you can't find anywhere else
Try the Volcano or the Pink Lady  good food, service, music close to bars on smith   eat it
i love this place
i highly recommend the volcano roll
and staff is hilarious
and the waitress' on the weekend are great
As a former loyal Osaka diner - I found Cube 63 per a recommendation of a friend
this place is so much better - the creative sushi rolls are fresh and tasty
the atmosphere is fun and to top off its BYOB
The room in the back is perfect for larger parties
Highly recommended
This place is amazing
The service is great, the food is fresh and yummy
And the best part is you can BYOB
If you like good sushi and live in carroll gardens you have to check out this place
It is the best sushi in Brooklyn
CHECK IT OUT!
Cube in Brooklyn is a sleeping giant! Great sushi in a relaxed and fun atmosphere! Can't wait for the warm weather when they open their garden

Though I'm not a vegetarian, Blossom goes into my rotation of regular neighborhood haunts for good food, good service and good vibe
Dishes are inventive and above average and the place is perfect for a low-key, relaxing meal
Lighting and decor are subtle and soothing, and even when crowded, the place is never noisy
Wait staff is smart, capable, in tune with customers, and just the right amount of friendliness and professionalism
I'm digging this great new addition to the nabe
I had no idea what to think going into a vegetarian restaurant
There are some that I really like and some that are
ehhh
I went to Blossom after being told how good the food was
We went on a Thurs night
They didn't disappoint! I had the Blossom Burger and the Beggars Purse to start! SOOOO good and the waitstaff was nice and fast
The place is nice and quiet and I would TOTALLY recommend the place even if you arent a vegetarian/vegan
My friend that went with me was kinda worried that the food would have no taste being that its veg
Well he's asking me to go back! I will be back at Blossom again! Paige
My friend ordered the curried seitan skewers and they were incredible, the kind of dish you keep talking about whenever you mention the place
I had a bunch of side orders and they were quite good
I went back later and had a tofu stir-fry, as sort of a test, because that's a dish that is easy to do in a very plain way
Unfortunately that is exactly what they did
They made no effort at an attractive presentation, and there was too much sauce
It tasted okay, not great
The service was friendly and the decor is very nice
I will keep going and will keep trying more dishes
The restaurant is lovely and the service, with major lapses, was friendly
The salad was lovely
But my entree, the portobello crusted seitan filet in red wine sauce, had an overwhelming amount of garlic
Never on the menu or in my inquiry to the waitress was the word garlic mentioned
If the waitress had been remotely available or had come by to enquire about our food, I certainly would have sent it back, but since I was being taken out for a birthday dinner I did not want to make a fuss
In addition, the dish was swimming in so much sauce that it was one big soggy disgusting mess
To add insult to injury, the red wine sauce spashed and ruined my best silk blouse
The dessert was a particularly yummy chocolate cake
Perhaps if I had a different entree, I would have a higher opinion of this restaurant
From service to ambience to food, this savy chic restaurant was more than excellent! With their poinant wine, delicious appetisers, phenominal entres, and succulent dessert, I have to give this place a thimbs up
I had one of the best pasta dishes ever! I got the tofu fra diavlo, and reccomend it highly
If your in the mood for healthy tasty food, check out this place! Oh and the choclate dessert was one of the most choclaty tasty ones yet!
Great food, romantic and great service
All organic, you can taste the freshness
You don't have to be a Vegan to eat there
It is just great food
My friend took me here a few months ago, and I was addicted to their rice ball for a while
I went there about 5 times
The servers are REALLY REALLY sweet
The food is really good, but I think the ball are a bit overpriced
Just three ball weren't filling; so, if you order a bunch, it can get quite pricey
My suggestion is if you want an actual meal, then definitely don't come here because you will spend quite a bit of money to feel full
However, if you want to snack on something light, then this is definitely a place to try
I highly recommend the shrimp popcorn, lobster salad, and tuna rice ball

Flavors are bold and straightforward
It's pointless not to ordered shared dishes
Whoever your with is goign to want to try yours and vice versa
Prices are very, very fair
The bar atmosphere feels like a William Gibson novel
Dark, asian, digital
Asahi served in large bottles (16oz?) goes well with everything
The wine list lists a number of bottles which have never been available on any of my visits
They should just reprint the menu without the wine list and save their staff some time
Service is OK
I've had some downright bad service and I've had some good, but the food is what I come for at 2:30 in the morning
This is a great place to hang out with your friends
They always play great music and they make the best lychee martinis!! It getts better
the kitchen is open unitl 4am!! The food is amazing, especially the king crab croquettes!!
when you can't wake up in time to eat dim sum for brunch, order it here
the dumplings are great, and the duck is fabulous
the calamari was tasty, not too greasy
the staff of fc are all super friendly, giving the bar a cheers like feeling
Forbidden city is amazing on sunday nights
not so much for the food or the drinks; but the regular sunday night band is fantastic
Live latin music and a fun crowd
No cover
We were meeting with friends for dinner - all first timers to this place
We got there at 9 on a Saturday night and this place was dead - empty
The portions are miniscule and the size of an entree could be half-and appetizer if even that large
Bad Value for the money
The drinks were ok but we had to move on to another place to finish dinner
Atmosphere was strange since it was so empty but I heard it fills up after midnight but I think there are much better places in the city to hang out
This place is worth a visit
The food is decent but small portions so expect to order a lot
lychee martini's are pretty yummy and so is the unfiltered saki give it a try if you havent already
gets very crowded on the weekends
slammin food
service be good
dont try to go to the bathroom at the last moment
the lines for it gets pretty long
I loved this place
Let's see
I liked their pork kakuni, spicy tuna hakozushi, jelly fish, ganmodoki, duck with scallions, etc
Everything was good
Must try-Green tea creme brulee
It's worth a try!! Their cocktails were unique too-I tried their green tea martini which tasted interesting
Lychee martini was good also if you're into sweet cocktails
i have been to forbidden city twice and always introduce it to visitors as part of new york that is the unpretentious cool, maybe because it hasnt been discovered as yet
? great, great lychee martinis and the tapas style food is very good
open v v late
and v friendly staff
My friends and I stopped in randomly and had the best time
It has nice atmosphere, the bartender was friendly
The lychee martini was one of the very best I've ever tasted
We ate like pigs because the food was so good we couldn't stop ordering (smallish portions, but you just get to try more food, so it works out)
The seared tuna was absolutely amazing
The shrimp and spinach dumplings were yummy
The seaweed salad was good too
I'd recommend it to everyone!
very cool/hip asian flair(?) bar/rest
hip/hop; drinks w/kung foo movie names; really cool
oh, and amazing food
not necc expensive
Went here w/friends late, late on a Friday night
They were still serving us amazing food @4am
Great vibe
Oh and I like the circular bar - access to your bartender is really important
All (and I mean all) of the staff were helpful friendly
great music
great atmosphere
friendly patrons and staff- STAN's the MAN
great,exotic drinks
it's a feel-good joint
romantic settings
highly recommended
Forbidden city is in a great part of town
No crowds, no tourists, no suits or fashion slaves, just people who are out to drink, like you
And if you are like me, and love GOOD sake, you need to go to Forbidden City
The menu is always changing, depending on season, with the manager and staff always on the lookout for good, better, and best brands of sake
As a bonus, you get served in square galss cups, with an overflow plate (someone help me out with the traditional name here)
I'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away
been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my fave hang out in the city
Altho the area seems shady, it's actually pretty safe
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy
I love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the food is also VERY good
does get very crowded on the wknds but everyone is nice, friendly and usually good looking Also tho there is no dance floor, they play really good music!!! =) Enjoy!!
The Scene Duos on dates and small groups of friends pack like happy sardines into this breezy, always-busy corner spot
Diners at the bar watch busy chefs scoop lobster salad onto warm brioche rolls
Owner Mary Redding keeps things fish camp-y with rod-and-reel rental prices and a list of "rules" on the backs of the menus
The Food It's easy, simple, unfussy seafood like you'd find at a roadside shack--that is, if you're really lucky and that roadside shack serves just-set, flash-fried clams and charry-lemony grilled octopus with homemade tartar sauce
And even though the lobster roll is legendary, and deserving of its reputation, it's the seasonal lobster pot pie--a luscious butter and cream diet-buster filled with lobster chunks, peas and topped with buttery puff pastry--that really deserves a cult following
Desserts, like the hot fudge sundae and seasonal pie, follow suit; nothing fancy, but they always hit the spot
The food was quite tasty, yet way overpriced for what it was
My beef was with the waitress
Not very friendly service, and then tried to charge us one dollar for a piece of bread to replace the bun that the lobster roll normally comes with
And we only discovered this once we saw the bill
There was no mention of this prior
What in heaven's name was she trying to pull
The lobster roll was not cheap
It was such a cheap move on their part
I have been to Mary's many times and I like it
However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great
The food is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it

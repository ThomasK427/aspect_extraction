my thoughts: brunch is $20 fix priced - food was fine, nothing to write home about
portions were not large and some might say that it's pricey
service was attentive at the beginning but the waiter lost us towards the end and we had to flag them down for the check
outdoor space was great, especially on a nice day - be warned though - pigeons are flying all over the place and around you
it gets very crowded after st
bart service ends
I recently dined at St
Bart's for the first time
Although we were seated promptly, it took forever for the waiter to greet us
I had to go so far as to ask the hostess to find our waiter, and she did, but made us feel like she was doing us a favor
We felt very rushed, and the waiter got our order wrong completely
Perhaps they just need MORE wait staff?  The atmosphere was great though, one of the nicer outdoor dining spots in the city
I would still recommend St
Bart's to friends
I decided to go to cafe st barts because it was supposed to be kids friendly
It is not
I called to ask them about that and they said on the phone that they had kids menu and we could eat inside in case it was too cold for the kids
We went there with my 2 kids
on a tuesday night
1) NO kids menu during the week (even though I called ahead and asked about that) 2) Could not eat inside - kids froze outside
3) Waiter was incompetent
4) Ordered wine from the list - they did not have it
5) Ordered soup of the day (chicken veg), waiter brings out tomato soup - they did not have soup of the day
Absolutely NOT kids friendly
but beautiful setting for a warm summer night for adults
I went there with my boyfriend for a Sunday Brunch
It was terrific
I definitely recommend making reservations since there is always a line
Fortunately we made reservation and were promptly seated
The outdoor setting was absolutely beautiful
White tables under the red umbrellas, half embraced by an old church, its like a postcard
$20/person value included a drink, some bread, and various breakfast selections
The portion is a little bit small, but it was well made
I will come back again
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St
Bart's
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
Ahhh
This is my go-to place when I want a delicious, reasonably-priced lunch or dinner
They just added this bbq brisket sandwich to the menu and I swear, I could eat it every day
And the chicken pot pie
In warm weather, the huge terrace is, in my opinion, the best outdoor spot in the city
Right now they're serving indoors, in a beautiful room with incredibly high, elaborately-decorated ceilings, and I understand they're putting up a heated tent on the terrace any minute
Service is gracious and not pushy or stuffy
I really love this place!
Love the Lobster Roll (full of lobster--super fresh), but THE FISH TACOS are to die for
Come in the evening, sip a glass of wine, or two, and enjoy the great live jazz along with your dinner
The service is super friendly, though maybe not as professional as the other stuffy, overpriced places in the neighborhood
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat
but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile! Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down
The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not
Cafe St
Barts is an oasis in the city, with a view that is delightful
The ambience and food, the presentation and service are all above average, and the prices are reasonable, especially when one considers the perfect locale! We look forward to also eating indoors in the winter! The menu is diverse, and there is a relaxed, comfortable environment
I get the impression that a lot of thought goes into the entire operation, and it shows! We would love to bring friends with us, especially out-of -town visitors, as this restaurant is so special!
Dining at St
Bart's Cafe on a nice summer evening is a wonderful New York experience, even for the most jaded New Yorkers
The backdrop of the church creates a unique setting
The outdoor cafe overlooks PArk Avenue and the hustle and bustle of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, but it is set back enough from the street to buffer the noise
To enhance the dining experience, there is a live jazz band, which further isolates you from the world outside the gates
On top of all this, the food is great! The service is also very attentive
In short, a must do experience in the heart of New York
Who would've thought - eating in a church
Lovely outdoor setting and pretty decent grub
(A bit pricey for what it is
) If the company's paying - GO FOR IT
But, be warned: long lines at peak hours (12 - 2PM)
We stopped in for what was to be a quick snack and after seeing the menu we de cided on an early dinner
what an unexpected pleasure, great food, great service
I work nearby and was very surprised to see that this landmark church also housed a cafe
The food and service is spectacular
Who could ask for a better view within this gothic cathedral
Great outdoor cafe in the warm weather!
Excellent location, great people watching
Food very good for the type of restaurant
I love this place! I work nearby so I've eaten here countless times (breakfast, lunch, dinner, even Sunday brunch), and been to several really cool parties--the food's delicious, and the setting is spectacular
The crispy fish tacos, the thin-crust pizza with fresh mozzarella, the lobster roll, the bratwurst direct from Indiana
it's all great! Everything's so carefully prepared, with such perfect flavors
Even the salads are special--they've got this goat cheese that's unlike anything I've ever had
The huge terrace is just so beautiful--and rumor has it they'll be tenting the space this fall, so we midtowners can continue to dine outside through the end of the year
This place rocks!
Always great
Great service, good food, especially desserts
Important to make a reservation
Cafe St
Barts is one of my favourite places to take business associates
There is something about the ambiance and atmosphere that makes everyone relax
Food, service and quality of personnel are all top class
We ate brunch here with my parents on a Sunday afternoon -- delicious food, lovely service, great value
What a delightful respite in midtown Manhattan -- go when the weather is nice, so you can sit outside
I wish I had taken down our server's name because she was phenomenal! Not only did she recommend a fantastic dish (the lamb, in which all three of us ordered and loved) but she was perfectly attentive and professional
Seconds before the first rain drop hit the floor, she opened up huge umbrellas for us and the neighboring tables
This was my third time to St
Bart's and I've always had a wonderful experience: the food has always been terrific, the outdoor setting is unbeatable and the prices reasonable
Oh, and the desserts

I agree with another reviewer that the dishes were sweet: they are
The service: surprisingly below average - not from lack of knowledge, just unfriendly
Fake smiles are worse than not smiling
Is it a Greek thing?  I made a reservation for 4pp a day earlier
When we arrived, the host was ready to seat us in the nice table in the front window until the bartender said that a party of 5 just called
We were then sat at a 'lesser' table near the back- and asked to move again (poor planning)
Situation understood, but dont let your patrons hear it! The $5p/p cutting fee for our self-brought cupcakes was absurd
After almost a year of planning to get to Taverna, I finally made it the other night and my only regret is that I waited so long
The restaurant has a lovely, romantic feel- candlelit and intimate and the service was knowledgable and attentive without being obtrusive, a quality many more expensive restaurants have not yet mastered
But the real star of this show was the food
There are so many wonderful small plates to begin with
We loved the Beet salad, the Pikilia where we sampled the delicious dips, and the sausage w/ fennel was superb
The entrees continued to dazzle us
(Loved the short ribs-WOW!!!) Paired with a lovely bottle of Greek wine, the evening was a great success
You can be sure I won't wait another year to return-
I had to farewell an intern today and wanted to take her to lunch - her choice of genre (my choice of location)
I found Snack Taverna on CitySearch and decided to chance it
I am so glad I did
I enjoyed every moment of our afternoon! The service was OUTSTANDING - a little too maternal though (is that really all that bad?) and the food was amazing
If you like Greek, check this place out
I definatey will be returning if just for the starters alone!
Almost didn't go after reading previous reviews
Called to make a reservation and b/c the man who answered was so nice decided to chance it
The host was very friendly, the bartender even said hello as we passed by
Asked for wine recommendations and the waitress told me her favorites and described them in detail - I don't encounter this much in NYC
Ordered saganaki, small salad, entrees: scallops, horta boureki, tilapia - too stuffed for dessert
Food is not traditional Greek, more like Greek-Mediterranean, it was very tasty
I have only lived in NY 4 months but have been extremely disappointed in service and value almost everywhere - except here
Everyone was very professional and efficient
I felt like they were glad we chose their restaurant - not like we were lucky to be there as I feel at many other places
I was excided to finally go to Snack Taverna since I had heard so many great things about it so I gathered some friends and went for a Greek Easter dinner
Upon arrival we were greeted by an obnoxious host who made us want to leave immediately
we stayed of course and hoped for a better dinner than the start
My Greek sister and I were soon disappointed again that the menu was a little more fancy and a little less taverna
We worked with what we had
When the food came - some was fine - salad
I make better tzaziki at home and I dont know what they were aiming with on the Mousaka
not even close
With the name snack taverna we had expected something that this was not and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to get some great Greek food especially Greeks
Seriously, the food is outstanding, authentic and imaginative
Our host was phenomenally friendly and helpful (maybe they've replaced the bad hostess??)
I adore this restaurant!!
the reviewer from 4/25 was absolutely right! i don't know if there's been a change in staffing or what since i last went but the current host was repellent
i'll spare you the details since it sounds lots of reviewers have had the same experience
this place was good when first opened but i won't be back
give me a break, you've got to get it together when it's new york and there are gazillions of other choices with better service
the food is ok but not worth the attitude
the initial good reviews here about the place must have been before the current manager was hired
i would have walked out but my party wanted to give it a chance
don't bother: mindnumbingly rude service makes it practically fraud that people pay to go there
While originally won over by the food, I will not return to Snack Taverna because of the rudeness of the manager/maitre d on two recent occasions
On the first occasion, he kept us standing while the table was obviously ready, and only begrudgingly agreed to accomodate our unexpected 5th guest
In the second instance, he directed his attitude toward friends to whom I had recommended the restaurant, rudely dismissing their inquiry as to whether the restaurant served liquor
They were so put off by his attitude that they got up and left
With many more friendly choices with great food in the West Village, I won't be returning to Snack Taverna
After having enjoyed SNACK we were excited to try SNACK Taverna
We made reservations for a Saturday night and confirmed them (as the SNACK staff requested) with a slight change in time
Imagine our surprise then when we arrived on time with out of town guests and were told we had no table reserved because we hadn't called yet a third time to reconfirm! Eating out shouldn't take this much effort
When the manager finally found us a table, he acted like he was doing us a big favor
He and the entire staff had attitudes, the portions were miniscule, the prices overinflated, the placed was cramped, and the food not all that great
Unless you like a large portion of ATTITUDE with your mousakka, AVOID at all costs
After arriving 5-10 minutes before our reservation, we were kept standing in this cramped place, even though there was an empty table
Another party of 3 arrived (late) and were given the last table
We were kept standing for another 40 minutes! Although the food (especially the roast chicken and skordalia) was memorable, the inexcusable wait was even more so
The prices were also inexcusable--$41 per person--without wine
The Food is AMAZING: skordalia, a mashed potato-garlic yummy goodness served with fresh, piping hot pita baked on site
Country sausage covered with pear-fennel compote, grilled to a crispy perfection
Cured beef, served thinly julienned with marinated cabbage on top of a butternut squash and dried fig on filo pastry
I cant describe how delicious this combination is
Main dish: chicken served with chickpeas, golden raisins, sauted with butter and spices incredibly fragrant and melding beautifully together
The chicken was boneless but not skinless, and was rubbed with garlic and other spices and baked until golden and crisp but not so that the meat underneath was drythe meat, even the white, was juicy and flavorful
Gosh, oh gosh, it was so so so delicious! I was astonished at the quality of this restaurant
I will take all of my friends when they come to visit
I've been to Snack and SoHo many times and I am never disappointed
My first excursion to this Snack was such a let down
I thought that everything tasted fine, some items were even great - but nothing was as good as the original Snack
This place just made us feel ripped-off
The appetizers were tremendously small, and they gave us one pita bread for four people even though we ordered four appetizers
Then, they charged us per extra pita that we requested
The main dishes were also very small, and all at the large price of $21-$25
Our waiter perpeutuated the feeling that all this place cares about is money
I think this place is trying too hard to be fancy, and they should stick to the old formula that works at the original Snack in SoHo
Food: appetizers was pretty tasty
My entree was fish, nothing special, too small, not worth the $21 it cost  Ambiance: nice, cozy, cute  Service: courteous but felt that we were at a fast food restaurant: the waiters are trained to quickly sit you, dine you, bill you, good bye you
Bottom line: not going back, the only positive was the ambiance (which you can get at most places)
The food, service were dissapointing
I thought the menu here would be not at all what I would desire, being Greek, but I was taken here on a blind date and was so amazingly surprised! Really, you should check this place out
It's amazing!!! Food is excellent, service is warm and accomidating, in the feeling in general is welcoming and casual
You should definitely try it; it's definitely worth it
Snack Taverna instantly thrusts Greek cuisine to the forefront of the New York food scene
Inspired interpretations of Greek classics join innovative original recipes to make this menu an instant favorite
The sausage with pear spoon sweet is a must-try, and the seafood is some of the freshest and most deftly prepared I've had anywhere
Let the staff guide you through the pleasures of The Greek Table and introduce you to some surprisingly sophisticated Greek wines
A memorable culinary experience, this ain't your neighborhood gyro joint
One of the more pleasing meals we've had in a while
Starting with Snack in Soho, these guys have walked on the quality side
Really fresh ingredients meet really fresh preparation here
Memorable mussels in a tomato sauce with goat cheese and ouzo
mmmmm
The service is attractive, warm and friendly

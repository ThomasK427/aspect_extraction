The food, though less refined, is consistently satisfying
The pasta prix fixe is a value that can't be beat
Dine after 8PM to avoid the pre-theatre crowd (and the noise level that it can bring)
We have eaten at Becco twice
The first time we had a little trouble being served seconds on the all you can eat pasta
But the food was so delicious that we decided to try them again
The second time the service was excellent the food as great as ever
Their pastas are delicious! We can't wait to get to New York City again to eat here
We were treated like royalty on our anniversary
Greeted at the door professionally and seated within a few minutes of our reservation we were out in time for our theater reservation
Pork Chop was AWESOME! Green beans amd little potatoes roasted were perfect
Service - Great Food - Great Don't miss dessert! Try the Tiramisu
My husband and I found ourselves on an impromptu Wednesday evening stay in the City for business
Friends recommended Becco and being a cooking show fanatic, knew Lidia's place had to be great
Not disapointed! We were treated to a wonderful taste of wines at the bar before dinner (yummy breadsticks and fresh olives), the staff trying to find us just the right one
Then dinner at a quiet table in the back room - everything was terrific - my husband had the pasta special, and my veal chop was delicious
Salads were fresh, tasty and the cannollis
well, we couldn't eat them after the meal, but they wrapped them up for us and it was a great late night snack at the hotel and even breakfast the next morning - best ever
We will be taking friends from out of town there before a show next week - can't wait!
Love of Lida's TV show lead me to Becco for dinner on a Thursday night
The restaurant was crowded and didn't have much elbow room
Waiters had to reach over people to deliver food
The food was sub-par
We ordered a prix fixie (aniti pasto or ceaser salad with 3 types of different pastas) and anitpasto caldo for two
Antipasto was interesting enough; however, pasta was only one step up from Olive Garden
The pasta offered for the night were penne w/ tomato basil, ling
w/ clam, and cannelloni
Among those, linguni with clam was best tasting; however, it was served with only 2 clams in the begining, and subsequent servings consisted only of pasta, no clam
For the total dinner price of $95, I think that the restaurant should have been better
Went pre-theatre on Sept 26th
The wait staff were friendly, knowledgeable and appropriately attentive
Never felt rushed
Jeremy, the sommelier, was charming, discerning and most helpful
The food was well prepared (osso bucco was fork tender and delicious) and the three desserts we tried were exquisite, especially the Pannacotta
My wife and I travel to NYC at least 5 times a year and always try different restaurants bur Becco is a keeper and we will go back
Our pre-theatre party of four was promptly seated and engaged in conversation by a friendly wait staff
The pasta special was delicious and an excellent value for restaurant row
The dining area was a bit of a squeeze, but tight quarters can be fun when everyone around you is obviously having a good time
Giant pans of pasta circulate through the dining area, refilling the plates of those that ordered the three pasta, all you can eat special
Everything is so fresh that you just expect Lidia to walk out of the kitchen with a spoon in her hand
The space is definitely crowded but whether you are pre theater or just looking for a reasonably priced restaurant in Manhattan with wonderful food and a fantastic wine list, this is the place
I cannot rave enough about the food and I just love the idea of a $20 wine list in addition to the regular
Restaurants all over Manhattan should adopt that idea!
Becco saved our night
We had reservations at Barbettas
Made them and had them confirm them the day before
Got there to find Barbetta closed for vacation!!! Becco fit us in and fed us WELL! A very busy place, good food, and great service!!! Save room for dessert, though as they are even better than the pasta
It's just another pre-theatre place and that's all! Like all the other supposed GREAT Restaurant Row joints, the food here is so-so and the ambience, well, there is none! It's crowded, noisy and frantic! The supposed deal is a Prix Fixe that includes a choice of marginal salads and three all you can eat pasta specials
Any menu offering/choice beyond that is over-priced and under-quality
If you go, get a downstairs table
At least there, they seem to have painted it recently and it's a lot brighter than the upstairs subway tunnel
After hearing so many good things and watching Lidia on her T
V
show, we finally got to visit Becco after being stuck in a blackedout hotel
Happy to say, everything was back to normal in NYC and the meal was delicious
The staff made it fun and next time in town we will definitely be back
P
S
Order the Fried Shrimp appetizer
Awesome
Becco came highly rated everywhere we looked
They have a fabulous wine list where every bottle is only $20 and the servers are knowledgable enough to make recommendations based on your likes and dislikes
I had the pasta special (the mushroom ravoli were incredible), my husband had a chicken dish
We shared a bottle of wine and a dessert, but our bill was only $90 (including tip)
We stuffed ourselves with food and took the cannelloni home to eat later
(By the way, if you like cannelloni ask for it as it wasn't on our menu!) One word of warning: this place is BUSY, so don't show up late for your reservations or they may not be able to seat you for a while
We were recently visiting New York and were on our way to a Show
We made reservations at Becco
We had prompt seating, outstanding service, amazing food, tremendous wine list (we recommend the Sangiovese)
What made our visit extra special was that we didn't have room for dessert at the end of our meal (the pasta was so amazing we just kept eating), our waiter suggested we come back after our show, which we did
To our surprise they recognized us, set up a special dessert table and served us some FABULOUS desserts, topped off with wonderful after-dinner-drinks
All in all, a perfect dining experience
Thanks Becco!
Pre Theater resteraunts are usually so so
so/  this place was great
Fast and Friendly, Delicious and Happy to See US!   Try the Appetizer of the SPECIAL CHEESE!   GREAT Wine List and GREAT PASTA!!
The meal was booked for a surprise 30th birthday for my husband
When making reservations, I asked if a bottle of Champagne could be waiting at the table for when we arrived
Not only was the chapmagne chilled and waiting for us, but the staff made us feel extremely welcome
The waiter even dressed up my husbands dessert with a candle and wrote 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate sauce - it's the little touches
The food was delicious, the service was fantastic and the price could not be beaten
I will definitely be returning and I would recommend Becco's to one and all!
We were late getting into town to see a Broadway show and had several cell phone conversations with the lady and gentleman who kept answering the phone
They were extremely helpful and held our table for us
After a LONG TERRIBLE drive into the city, we arrived at Becco
Very warm greeting and excellent service
Our food came out on time and we got to our show which our waiter gave us directions to
Too many good things to say about this place
This past Saturday, two weary, rain-bedraggled shoppers showed up at Becco
Even tho we did not have reservations, the lovely young lady at the door put us down for the 1st dinner seating
We were treated in grand style by all the staff, and had the best meal we've had on a shopping trip
Although we could have made a meal of the breads and dip alone, sis had a super steak;I had perfectly grilled salmon
Too full for desert but I ordered the sampler anyway
We devoured it
If you want to be alone, eat at home
If you want cheap, go to McD's
But if you want really good food, pretty surroundings, sweet people waiting on you
give Becco a try
Sis works in a hospital , I work in a factory
Our pennies are hard-earned

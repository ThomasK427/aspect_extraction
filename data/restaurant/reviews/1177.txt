Unprofessional was the word that kept coming to mind
One got the feeling that the kitchen, not the unattentive but friendly wait staff, was the reason for this dragged out dinner
The food was just OK, when it was served correctly
We both had ordered soup, only one of us got it
This restaurant is called a dining oasis in The Bronx? Utter nonsense! If they really want to compete with the big boys of gourmet dining they better instill better coordination
One can expect to get better service at any fair to middling local Bronx restaurant, which this night is all The Riverdale Garden was
A last minute choice, instead of older, better known, more expensive romantic restaurants and it was HEAVENLY
The food was memorable and it is now our favorite restaurant !!!!The waitress was sweet, and helpful
The maitre'd made us feel very welcomed and the free valet parking an added convenience
But most of all the food was FABULOUS
We also loved the patio and view of the garden (despite the view and noise from the elevated subway)
After all, I am a native New Yorker and we both have lived in the Bronx
We had and recommend the Grilled Salmon, Sirloin Steak, Endive and Watercress Salad, Arugula salad on brioche,Champagne and Italian sparkling wine by the glass and the Triple chocolate dessert
WE LOVE this place
Don't tell too many of your friends because we don't want it to be overrun with Manhattanites
That's what all my friends say when I take them to my favorite restaurant, The Riverdale Garden
The food is amazing
Be sure to save room for dessert, and after that, the petit-fours! The menu is always different and always really delicious
There's always some side dish on the menu which I've never heard of
I love learning new things, so this is a bonus for me! You'll have a great, friendly, gourmet experience at The Riverdale Garden
Finally a restaurant in Riverdale that is worthy of its inhabitants - wonderful food, great service and a terrific ambience
It's my dream come true - a first class place in Riverdale
Come to the beer tasting, the wine tasting, come hear music or enjoy the fireplace and a glass of wine while waiting for your table
The second time you go, you will feel like family there
Cheerful, energetic service, a chef who comes out to be sure the diners are satisfied and happy, and in general, an atmosphere where you can hear yourself - and your companions - talk and hear the background music
Congratulations to Michael - well done - and welcome to Riverdale!
This restaurant is a saving grace for those who live or work in or around Riverdale
Michael, the chef and owner, is friendly and in my opinion (and in the opinion of all my singer friends who live in Inwood and Riverdale) quite competent
Perhaps the previous reviewer should try the restaurant again as I am sure it was just an off moment at this otherwise glorious addition to the neighborhood
My friends and I have had some of the best meals of our life here, especially the fish dishes
Recently, Michael had halibut seared with mushroom dust and served with crisp shiitake mushroom sandwiches
ummmmmmm!! I urge all foodies north of 96th street to try this potentially great restaurant while you can still get in
The food is excellent and the service is even better
They're very attentive there, have interesting dishes and specials and the prices, while not cheap, are well worth it
Highly recommended to try this jewel in Riverdale!
The Scene Students, area professionals, and those looking for a cheap food fix all hustle in and out of the hip dumpling house
Artful globe lights peer down on the restaurant's simple tables and sleek wood floors
A few seats look onto the sidewalk, but most cluster around the glassed-in kitchen, where diners can watch dumplings being coaxed into existence
The Food Dumplings come in six varieties, each with its own dipping sauce, and can be ordered steamed, fried, or in a noodle soup
None of the flavors are overwhelming, and all taste superlatively fresh
The heftiest is the classic pork with cabbage ginger and scallion
A hint of wasabi enlivens the shrimp; while the vegetarian, stuffed with seasonal greens, gets overwhelmed by its healthful-tasting herb dipping sauce
Go "combo" and order your dumplings with a side of the green salad, doused with a tangy citrus-ginger vinaigrette
Best dumplings I've ever eaten! So good
so inexpensive! Great space and wonderful service! I had the thai dumplings with a salad and it was wonderful
Portions are just right and wonderfully delicious
Can't wait to go back!
New York magazine just gave the chocolate soup dumpling balls the #10 most delicious chocolate dessert in NYC award
Since all the other places require ties, this is probably the easiest and cheapest way to indulge yourself
BUT BE CAREFUL
We're talking scalding hot jets of chocolate pumping out of the holes made by your incisors
It's dangerous chocolate
In terms of savory dumplings, I like to do a mix of porks and ducks
(I know that sounds dangerous, too
)  The guys who manage the place are friendly (even though one of them hates the shrimp dumplings and longs for you to write in comments validating his taste buds)
It's clean, well-lit, fast and I think pretty healthy
Except I'm not kidding about the danger balls: get them but watch out
Quick and easy place to stop in for a bite to eat
You order at the window and grab your food on lunchroom cafeteria style trays
Seats are hard to find during lunch hour
But, food comes out quickly and is hot! I got the duck dumpling fried in the soup
Big portions and very filling
If you get them in the soup, I would just get them steamed
A friend and I went last Friday for a quick meal
We had the duck and thai chicken dumplings with a salad and mushroom soup as sides
Soup tasted like water and soy sauce and came in a teeny-tiny take-out container
Green salad and soy sauce dressing was okay
The duck dumplings were mediocre, the thai chicken just didn't taste very good
The only thing this restaurant can really brag about is its trendy decor and gimmicky packaging
Yes, the prices are relatively inexpensive for the area but to me, mediocre food is hardly ever a bargain
If you're asian or have eaten a lot of asian food (I'm both) try another dumpling bar, even mandoo is better
FYI, you can get fresh watermelon juice in many bubble tea/juice places in chinatown
We also tried the chocolate dumplings, just trendy but nothing spectacular
Great place to stop by munch on dumplings! Everything was great- we got the pork dumplings w/salad, chicken dumplings w/noodles, green tea milkshake chocolate dumplings
Loved the noodles spicy tofu in the soup
Loved everything from the food, to the service, to the music to the boxes the food comes in!!! Awesome value if you don't want to haul all the way to Chinatown
We needed something like this in the city! :)
First time there, I like the look of the place nice atmosphere
The service was very good
I didn't have to wait for my order
The dumplings were pretty good and not expensive
I would go there again
On the other hand, If you can't go to Chinatown, you could always go there
No joke, the place looks fabulous for the location and the prices aren't terrible
One who knows Chinatown well enough will realize there are cheaper and tastier options available down there
However, the allure of its very trendy interior is what will make it a nice lunch spot for those who are nearby
Its not easy to find parking, so consider walking there
The service is fast, the dumpling chefs are very good, the bathrooms are clean, and most of all the price is affordable at $6
95 for 8 pieces with your own sauce
We come here for the dumplings but they come in a box almost as cold as those standing behind the cashier
Their respective exotic sauces/dips did not complement the dumplings they were supposed to be matched with; we ended up dipping them all in their classic soy sauce
The soups have a slight bitter after taste
The watermelonade is refreshing and a must; certainly a place to go when in a hurry and hungry with the club- like music jazzing up the joint
Otherwise, head for Chinatown for better dumplings
Don't understand all the hype
I got the fried duck dumplings, and they were mediocre at best
Almost tasteless
I've had tastier dumplings not just in Chinatown, but at just about any hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant throughout the city
Maybe the duck dumplings just aren't that good, and the other types are better??? I don't know, but Im not likely to find out anytime soon
After passing this place day after day, I decided to finally try it

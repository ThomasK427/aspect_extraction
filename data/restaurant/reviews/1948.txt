The food is excelent and the service is better
They really make you feel at home
It is a must do while in New York
The food here is quite good and easy to enjoy
The lunch specials are very well priced, and the rest of the menu is very reasonably priced
For good value, this is a great place to try, especially at lunch time
The service was friendly and attentive as well
The atmosphere could have been more elegant, though the place still had a decent feel to it
I was glad to enjoy an inexpensive meal and have a pleasant dining experience
There's a lot of competition for great Italian food in New York, but this is a good place to try, and it won't create any budget problems
My wife and I have been to Fratelli's many times
The reason it survives and makes new friends is the way the restaurant presents itself
Friendly, warm, Italian flare
The best Italian food I've had yet
Little Italy was a wonderful place in and of itself
However, I was glad we found this place to eat
The service was very fast and very, very friendly
They were so sure of the wine they recommended to my husband they offered to pay for it if he did not like it
It was some of the best homemade lasagne I have had
My husband had veal and my daughter had penne pasta that was very, very fresh
I mainly go to restaurants for the food
Nice atmosphere, etc
is
well, nice, but being a real foodie, I'll travel far and wide for a savory meal
I have been to Il Cortile about 4 times now, and always marvel at the quality of the dishes
Their breaded veal cutlet with proscuitto, some type of cheese and broccoli rabe is to die for
The veal cutlet is never tough (like at other places), and melts in your mouth
Their veal chop with artichokes and pistachios, and their pasta dish with meatballs, sausage and pork are both incredible
While the food is terrific, you must overlook the often apathetic service, and the sometimes downright rude Manager that seats people
Some of the best italian food in the entire city! Reasonably priced considering the beautiful, romantic atmosphere
Frist of all, mad dudes who stress out on restaurants in general are usually extremely finicky (read: cheap)
I am a true foodie, and this place was just ridiculously good
Big-ups for the fresh bread, the amazing antipasto, and the simple, yet delicious pasta dishes
All you haters complain all you want, but just man-up and pay over $20 for a meal once in your pathetic existence
There is more to life than wack food, treat yourself and then go get a canoli across the street
Your welcome!
The below reviewers are RIGHT
I came here last year with my aunt and cousin and the food was absolutely mouth watering
I get belly hunger pangs just thinking about the Salmon Fettucine dish I ordered
yum
This is probably the best FILLING mouth watering Italian food I've had in NYC, and I've lived in NY my whole life
On a down side, the service was really mediocre
Our waiter was waiting on one other table in the empty restaurant but he didn't seem too interested in our needs
We had to flag down a busboy twice
i love this place -- hands-down, my favorite italian restaurant in little italy
i've been there more than a dozen times and it's really consistently good food
only once have i been disappointed (busy fri nite and the place was packed), but even then, the food was good
servers are really great, and there's not too much turnover so there's a really fun, family atmosphere
they are more friendly when it's not prime time busy dinner hours so go a little earlier or a little later than when everyone else wants to eat
ambience is great, but sometimes a bit loud
just ask to be seated away from the groups and you'll be fine; the place is spacious enough to handle the groups and intimate couples
ENJOY
I ate here during the San Ginero
While the place clearly jacked up the prices, it's nice place to sit and watch the crowd walk by
The mussels were good, but not really that hot but the main courses where very tastey
I had the chicken Nepoleano and the sauce was nice and buttery
Service was decent considering the amount of people the waiter was serving
The only down side is that it took forever to get our food
Dinner for 2, apt, and a bottle will be around 100 bucks
On a side note, this place had very nice bathrooms!
Go on Sunday, you have to try their Sunday Sauce with meatballs, braciole and sausage
Delicious
Also, no to be missed are the fried artichokes
I was there during a Sunday lunch with friends and will most definetly go back
I dont understand, after reading all of the reviews, how anyone could say anything bad about this restaurant
I am a native New Yorker who enjoys dining out and I have been many places in the city, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST! I think it would be hard to find any better italian food in New York
Of course if you go there on saturday night at 8:30 it will be busy and noisy, but the food is ABSOLUTELY worth any wait or noise
If you haven't been to Il Cortile, please dont pass up the opportunity, you will regret not having a chance to experience this great restaurant
Has quickly become my favorite restaurant in NYC
Food is always terrific
Service and seating may at times be slow, but just relax and enjoy the ambience
Favorite dish is the lobster ravioli
Can't go wrong with any pasta dish
I Recommend this restaurant to all my out of town friends
Don't mean to pick on reviewers (yes I do), but the pizza bread is meant to be cold and to complain that the salmon and linguine is too fishy is moronic
Also, both my parents were born in Rome and I go once a year and believe me the food is comparable
Do not recommend for anyone not of drinking age
Ordered the seafood salad, having been told of the shrimp and scallops
My dish had 2 (maybe 3) small shrimps and 2 small scallops - the rest was mainly octopus and squid
Had I been informed when I asked, I would not have ordered the seafood salad
The salmon and linguini was also a disappointment - very fishy tasting
The chicken was acceptable, browned in a wine reduction, but the skin on the chicken was chewy and fatty, not crisp
Overall, disappointing, considering all the restaurants there are in the neighborhood to choose from
Wouldn't return
had a birthday party there last weekend, i was a little iffy about coming here because of the prices, but most of the reviews seemed positive
we had a party of 12 and afterwards i took a poll and the concensus was that the food was good but too salty, the ambience was good (we sat in the garden room), service was below average, and overall not worth the prices
i ordered a glass of wine and one of the hosts accidentally brought over two glasses, so he set one aside on the dessert table
when i ordered another glass later on, he brought me that same glass that was sitting there for over half an hour
very unprofessional
I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years, and so am understanding of things out of my server's control, and I have never experienced such poor service! My boyfriend took me to dinner for an early Valentine's Day, we showed up early for our reservation to meet an incredibly rude host who told us the bar was full, to just wait behind a rope
Please, this isn't a club! From there it just went downhill
My boyfriend tipped the busboy rather than the server because he was the only one who was helpful
There are so many better Italian restaurants with better food and better service in new york city that I would NEVER recommend this one
Absolutley one of the top 3 restaurant experiences of my life
We visited during the St
?? festival, the strret was packed with booths, incredible atmosphere
We ate inside in the back room which looks like an lod church, beautiful stained glass ceiling
Servcie was impeccible, the room was beautiful and romantic
The food was simply wonderful
Tasty, perfectly seasoned, flavors were beautifully complimentary, nothing was cloying or overbearing and everything was fresh, fresh, fresh! I'ts 4 months later and my mouth is watering and my stomach begging as I think about it

I've tried ALL of their different type of paninis, and they're ALL delicious! I highly recommend their turkey cuban panini
Also, for breakfast, I highly recommend their breakfast sandwiches (particularly the jumbo english muffin sandwich) and their pancakes
Their freshly squeezed juices are absolutely marvelous! Also, it's VERY affordable!
liberty had a huge variety of foods
from hot entrees to salads and sandwiches, and freshly made pizza
i couldn't decide what to eat
i eventually decided on the chicken club panini and my husband got the lasagna
For $15 we got an extremely filling meal, I got the #12 special which added a soda, chips and a pickle to the sandwich, and a cookie for $1 more
The food was very hearty
The service was quick and there's a place to eat in the back
A great place to go for a quick inexpensive lunch
This place was shut down because of construction damage
Not sure when it opens back up
Irish fare served in a classic dark wood setting; the highlight is their cozy back room which feels like stepping into a one-room cottage, complete with fireplace, stoneware sitting on the wooden shelves, rough wooden tables, and a museum-esque feeling
Live music, a well poured Guinness, cocktail sausages
these are some of the things that make me proud to be an Irish American
The Scene Grafted onto the New York Public Library in midtown's leafy Bryant Park, this sunny and spacious restaurant draws mostly seasonal tourists and weekday business lunchers
The New American menu includes everything from crab cakes to artichoke-anchovy salad to grilled chicken, and there are many fresh-tossed Mediterranean pastas to choose from
The tables come along with a view: Floor-to-ceiling windows face the well-tended, people-packed park
I took a couple clients to the Grill recently
We were to meet at the outdoor bar but it was ridiculously crowded with people actually elbow to elbow and no way to get to the bar
We decided to have dinner at the Grill
On the outside, it looked like a nice place o eat outdoors on a beautiful spring evening
Howefver, the food was so-so and a bit overpriced and the service poor
In fact, the waiter was not skilled at all and he appeared to be stressed out
He kept abruptly interrupting our conversation and looked more like he was in a hurry to turn the table than serve us
A place like this at these prices should hire quality staff
Again the food was just OK
For the record, I've no problem with taking myself out for a $100 brunch buffet, so long as the service, ambiance and food are plentiful and of a high quality
I've gone to such brunches on many occasions
So I am not being cheap when I say that the $26 prix fixe brunch at Bryant Park Grill was not worth it IMHO
All you get for $26 is a choice of one entree (fancy french toast, omelette, etc
), a complimentary average pastry basket and a drink (champagne, orange juice - not fresh-squeezed, etc
) While the location and ambiance sure are nice, I found the price a bit expensive considering the quality of the food was nothing spectacular
Came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon
Great ambience and pleasant surroundings but the food and service were mediocre at best
I've had much better of both at far cheaper establishments
The sauce in my penne with baby shrimp (~$19) was on par with what I'd find in a jar at the local grocery store
My friend had the five cheese ravioli (six pieces of ravioli for ~$20), which he described as average and far from worth the money
All in all, the ambience does not make the prices worthwhile
You leave with an uneasy feeling knowing that you definitely did not get your bang for your buck here
Dining here is a pleasant experience if you're looking to dine al fresco
Food is elegantly presented and good although I would not say up to par with elegant restaurants in the area
I had the artichoke ravioli which was delicious
My dining companion had the cod which was average
The crowd at the bar here is a bit more grownup and refined then the crowd at the cafe
Overall, I think dining at here is beautiful for a first date or something a bit more special however, I prefer the laissez faire atmosphere at the cafe
I went for brunch with my elderly mother who walks with a cane, and the hostess seated us in the farthest reaches of a nearly empty outdoor patio area
The brunch is an outrageous $30 prix fixe for a limited menu of ordinary food
Service was slow and disorganized
I get better service and food at my local diner
A park view isn't worth it
I was so disappointed when I took my cousin to this restaurant recently for her birthday
The food was below par, especially at these prices
The raw bar that we were served was abyssmal, and our dinners of salmon (mine overcooked) and chicken (hers, very bland) weren't much better
I can honestly say that Bryant Park needs a much better restaurant for such a fabulous space
There are many other restaurants close by that are well worth the cost
This is an excellent place for lunch
I've been many times
The ambience is great and the food is even better
I especially like their selection of salads and desserts
I've been many times and have never been dissapointed
Tip: if you are going for lunch make reservations it can get quite crowded
went out to lunch with a couple coworkers, this place sucks
Horrible food stay away
I'm eat out everyday and I know good food in nyc, but this place has the worst service, food is bland, and hate the phoniness
If you want bad service and phoniness, then go
Otherwise, a diner would be better than this garbage
The ambiance is very inviting and relaxing
However, the quality of the food is terrible
Granted, Bryant Park Grill received mediocre reviews on the food but one would not expect the food to be so terrible
The swordfish and filet mignon were tough
The mixed seafood platter was extremely bland
It was a birthday party with 17 people and all 17 people thought the food was terrible
I will never visit this place again
I ordered some fish plate (can't even remember what fish I ordered, it was so blah) and my friends ordered chicken quesadillas during happy hour
The quesadillas came out with deli-style turkey-ish meat on it
When we inquired about the meat, the waitress stated that people ALWAYS ask if it is turkey, but assured us it was chicken
Although Mex is hardly their specialty, I am weary of trying anything else, since I can make a decent quesa (and even fish) at home without so much a hitch
We have had Holiday dinners at the Bryant Park Grill for about five years
However, the service has not, until this year, been on a par with the food
Hooray - this year, service was acceptable, even attentive
We were seated with a good view of the Christmas Tree in the park and this fact, combined with excellent food and service, made our dinner and choice of restaurant a very satisfying one
The food is OK, but go for the atmosphere on a a beautiful day
It feels great to sit outside with a refreshing drink and feel like you are someplace outside the city
Great afterwork spot too! Stay and linger in Bryant Park
It is one of my fav spots in midtown in the summer!
The only thing good about this place is that its outside
The drinks are overpriced
Service very slow (when busy) and the food is lousy
Been here two times, once for a date and once for a midweek dinner after work and shopping
The main course was good, prices reasonable for any restaurant similar in the city
I didn't like the bread, three types, two hard as a rock and the other just didn't taste too great
Our waitress was friendly, but the hostess wasn't so welcoming
This place is ok, nothing great
While it's nice to be outdoors in the summertime, that's about all it's good for
The food is over-priced and tasteless
The drinks taste FINE, but you're really paying to be outside
Plus, this place gets PACKED to the gills
I didn't think the Bryant Park Grill was anything great

Every time I eat there I feel as if the chef and waitstaff have cooked, prepared and served a meal as if I am the only customer/guest
It's homemade food, great care is taken with each dish, the ingredients are very fresh, organic and local when available
The service feels more like a small town or family run B B rather than a new york restaruant
This is not a quick meal, it's a place to have appetizers, a meal and dessert and it will take two hours
Personally, I recommend the scallop appetizer which has been pefectly prepared every time
Any salad is great, the steak is very good as are the fish dishes
We enjoyed our meal here very much
My watermelon and feta salad was fantastic, as was the zaatar steak
Desserts were only alright
the cherry apple crumble was more like dense bread pudding, and the poppy shortbread with mead soaked raspberries wasn't nearly as exciting as it sounded
Service, however, was warm and inviting, which made all the difference
We came all the way from Queens, and glad we did
Try the artisinal cheese's appetizer with Sardinian, Gouda, and Goats Milk--with Strawberry preserves for a dip and grapes on the side! Simply mouthwatering! And the tomato and thai basil with mozzerella? Also very good
The skirt steak was delightfully tasty too
As a seasoned restaurant visitor in New York, this place is a find in Brooklyn
Highly recommended
Great place in Park Slope
THe service and help is impeccable
They offer different flavors and a variety of ingredients that blend very nicely together
The help with the wine was great
I will be returning to this place even though I do not live in the area
Duck confit cigar was nice, thought slightly oily
Skirt steak was perfectly grilled and drizzled with a balsamic clove reduction which complemented the blandness of the beef
Housemade saffron fettucine (whose house? where's the saffron?!!) came in appetizer size (of course, entree priced), it was dry and devoid of flavor
The pasta's saving grace came in the form of a poached organic egg
The wait staff forgot our wine order and bread was slow to arrive
We want to like this place -- having came twice before and enjoyed it -- but this time around we left disappointed
The ambiance is still excellent for couples
I've been going here ever since it opened
I've brought friends, GF's, friends and family of GF's and parents
While it has undergone some normal transformations from being slightly pretentious when it first opened up it has been very resilient and consistantly quality oriented
I've had a few minor bumps with service and yes it can be a bit cramped at times, but as a chef I have to dispute the claims of this website ed
staff and some dissenting reviewers in saying it is always well seasoned and DUH, they provide a cleverly placed tray of salt for you to use if you think otherwise
I've always found the staff caring and compasionate
The bathroom is always clean, etc
Try the seasonal stuff, there is NOTHING like this in the SLOPE
I've raved equally about Al Di La, but this is a different experience and well worth it!
What an improvement from when it first opened! The food is just yummy
Terrific service, and food that is really appropriate for the season
My dinner at rose water after a recent bam performance was very enjoyable
The host helped me select a wine that I think served the meal well
Tapping local organic growers for many ingredients helps ensure fresh and tasty dishes
I also like the low key atmosphere inside, but green plastic patio chairs should be banned from all restaurants
Yes, I absolutely love this restaurant and no, I don't work here
I had a meal at Rose Water that I won't forget anytime soon, one of the best since I've moved to New York
Everything was cooked with fresh organic ingredients, and with such care, preparation and skill! In such a small restaurant, it was as if you were dining at a friend's house (well, if the friend were an exceptionally trained chef)
The service, the decor - intimate, informal and enthusiastic
I cannot think of a more lovely combination, and I will definitely return to see what creations they whip up next
The previous reviews were written by the familes and friends of the restaurant owner!! I had a totally different experience last Friday
My daal soup was drenched in olive oil and my blue fish entree was cold and poorly accompanied by the mustard greens
This place tries too hard to create fusion food and ends up dragging the ingredients kicking and screaming into an unhappy union
It did not merit a 24 food rating in Zagat's
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me
It also begs the question of when the NY Daily News gave them the honor Westway boasts as its not true now
I can name at least 5-10 better diners and I have in now way come close to sampling many of NYC's top diners
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary
The very often mess up your orders and meals do come incomplete (for example asking to add becan doesn't mean they will even though they charge you for it)
Have had the same problem in the diner but that is easily correctable
To be fair, the food still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy
I live about a 1/2 block from Westway and when I want consistantly good food, big portions, great fast service and a step above your average diner food I go there! Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are all great, but they are hit or miss with some of their pasta dishes
Sometimes their sauces aren't very authentic or good, but that is the only flaw I've had in the 11 years I've been going there!
I haven't been in New York latley but i went back to my neighborhood place, and it was totally different
They have remodel for the better
The place is unbelievable! The fod is still great, with plenty of choices
The service was okay
Whenever I come back to town, I'll visit them again!
We stopped at the Westway Diner on a rainy Friday night
Got seated right away
The menu is huge
Service was friendly and very fast
Food was okay - my burger tasted good but was not cooked all the way through
There are better diners in New York - we probably wouldn't go back
Such a nice location
Such a nice place to eat
There is a theme to the place, it's a NewYork theme
This is NYC! A NY coffee shop that looks like a NY coffeeshop! Food: Seafood, Italian, Greek, American, Steak
On a budget? No problem! Good service! You're one of the family! Want a drink? Sure! Their stuffed clams are wonderful! I live in NorthCarolina, and eat here whenever I'm in the city!
Our business orders from the 'ol Wester almost every day
The finest Turkey Burgers and Chicken Noodle soup on the East Coast
I'm serious
Don't overlook it just 'cuz it's got the word Diner in its name
The Westway is culinary nirvana
Let me tell you
First, the used bread had low grade oil
The salad was not what we ordered, but whatever it was it was awful anyways
The shrimp parm was $25 and the shrimp was non existent, all bread
The linguini with clam sauce tasted like dish water mixed with clams and the pasta tasted like last nights left overs
We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!
My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant on saturday
The lobster ravoli was very excellent, because it was actual lobster instead of the usual lobster paste that is used in most lobster ravoli dishes
My boyfriend had the pork chops, and he really liked his meal
Overall, a very nice meal and excellent service for the price
Every time I visit NYC, I come here
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city
Service is excellent, no wait, and you get a lot for the price
Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world
When visiting little Italy definitly go somewhere alittle more authentic
This fish shack is exactly that
Fried fish, limited pasta menu and very limited appetizers
Don't get me wrong food is good but, not the reason for coming to mulberrystreet

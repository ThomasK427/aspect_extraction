Looks like a diner, but the food quality is much higher
Would go back again to try the sandwiches or breakfast items
The decor is unarguably very cool
The food is really good, too
The service, however, is very slow and the restaurant is too expensive for what you get
My main problem is that they charge $6
00 for chips and salsa after your first (small) bowl
I wouldn't have minded so much, but we waited over half an hour for our $25
00 tacos after the first bowl of chips was long gone
I guess that's how they get you to overpay for more
A wonderful place for a non-noisy, leisurely brunch
We have been a couple of times on Saturday mid-day and had an eclectic and delightful range of dishes, and were able to have a delightful conversation with out-of-town guests both times
We have not experienced other times, but our visits have been wonderful and is now our favorite place for brunch
You might not expect to have an excellent sliced steak at a place that specializes in tacos but you will be surprised
Cooked a perfect medium-rare, the quality of the meat was high
That was also the case with the deliciously moist grilled fish special
The fries were top-notch too
The bottom line is that, no matter what comes out of the kitchen, this place takes it seriously
It's all in the details
Start with the small green salad with delicious Mexican cheese and walnuts and you will see
Wash it all down with a reasonablly priced ($32
) bottle of good Spanish plunck and you're in heaven
My only complaint is the noise level which, at some point in the evening, is obviously a plus
This is a fun place to go for Margaritas and the place is great for drinks and snacks but I wouldn't go there if you want a really big, delicious mexican dinner
4 Tacos and 3 margarita's later, the bill was $80
I left unfulfilled and disappointed that my tuna was bad
For great Mexican food go to Mexicana Mama, La Cucina or Agave
We just went to Diablo for brunch today and it was great
Normally I don't think Mexican for brunch, but at 2 PM it was more of a savory brunch that really hit the spot
They have these great cinnamon/sugar tortillas that are almost addictive
If you aren't full from those, we had the Huevos Rancheros and these shredded chicken chilaquiles that were really good
For $16 prefixe, you can get a great bloody maria and a mexican mocha, a large selection of entrees that includes either a side of caramelized onion and roasted potatoes or cheese grits
Overall a fun brunch with good food
finally something different then all the other wanna-be cool and different NYC restaurants
this one has hit the jack pot
Good for groups, good for a date, great place to meet for drinks, good for dinner and great for brunch
the service is freindly and fast
this is a local joint but also a hip joint
gotta check it out
with so many restaurant options in NYC i try to not go to the same place more then twice--but Diablo is a staple joint for any occasion
huge fan!
When you want to go out with your friends and drinking is your primary objective
And a sports bar just isn't the scene you're looking for
TEQUILA, they know what they're doing at DIABLO ROYALE
From the safe frozen versions to straight or sipping
One of the finest selections with no pretense
Ole!
I can't say enough good things about the experience I had at Diablo Royale
This is the perfect place to come to after work for food and drinks or any other time for that matter
Normally, I'm a beer drinker, but after speaking to one of the owners, I was convinced to try a Diablo Rickey (Dos Equis Margarita)
It was great along with several other drinks we had that night
Not only were the drinks good, but if you're anywhere between the ages of 25-35, you will not be able to stop mouthing the words to the music they play
(It was similar to driving alone in my car and hitting the radio song jackpot)
Later, I learned that the decor was all designed by the owners as well
Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time with good friends
Love the food and the decor! great margartitas and awesome place to meet up with some friends for a fun and casual meal with delicious margaritas(try the frozen black cherry) and yummy fish tacos  and the brunch with a complimentary drink on the weekends is really a great deal- you must try it out
Good people running a fine mexican restaurant
Always an option, many times the choice
Relaxed enviroment, Great food and margaritas
You Must try the corn!
I heard about this place a couple months ago and have been a regular ever since
The Margarita's a great, but you've gotta try the Diablo Ricky (beer and frozen margarita)
So addictive! The tacos are fantastic and while some people complain about the price, the amount of food you get more than makes up for it
Best fish taco I've had - hands down
The place also just has a great vibe
Casual and fun
I went there for brunch the first time last week and everything was great
Bloody Maria's and awesome pancakes
Definetly worth checking out
Went here with a bunch of friends after work after seeing it on Citysearch hearing some good things
We only had drinks but we all liked the atmosphere and the various margaritas we tried were excellent
Nice location in the West Village and very friendly service
I look forward to heading back to try the food
After waiting for our waitress to come for at least 15 minutes, we finally had to call her over to take our orders
When our food came the bus boy brought two sauces
he explained that the one in the bear bottle was mild and the tall bottle was hot
I put some of the mild sauce on the first bite
As soon as I swallowed my tongue and mouth were on fire! Instead of apologizing, busboy took the sauces away and didnt come over again
I was coughing, my eyes were watering and I couldnt breathe but did the waitress ask if everything was okay? Nope
The whole place could tell I was in pain and no one apologized or helped
One busboy said that I should drink milk but didnt bring it until my friend had to ask for it and then he gave her an attitude!
As a neighbor, I've been there several times and enjoyed it every time
Inventive and unusual cuisine
freshly made guacamole and salsa, in fact everything is fresh
staff is really nice
table service is good
i've tried several items on the menu and all are extraordinary
You can eat up at the bar too - great, friendly and attentive bartender
Try the shrimp tacos and the steak
I have absolutely no complaints about this new place
Pricing is typical for the neighborhood, and much cheaper than the 'hood's other good mexican - Mexicana Mama
I agree with other reviewers, the food's good but their kind of stingy
You pay $15 for two tacos that just have meat in them, and a little bit of lettuce/radishes
Service was great but we went pretty late when it was thinning out
My friends and I loved the vibe, the food was really good, drinks as well
My only gripe is it is really pricey for Mexican food
The tacos do not come with any extras and they are pretty expensive
what is up with that? Service was ok, we felt a little rushed but no biggie still a nice evening
I really like the energy of Diablo, the margarhitas are good, food is pretty good as well
However, 7 dollars for a taco minimum of 2 and the usual things that would come with are extra on top of that

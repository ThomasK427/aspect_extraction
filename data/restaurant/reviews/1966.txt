When I went back this summer at around 7, the place was packed and I was told that there would be an hour wait
When I asked if there was a seat at the sushi bar, she said that it was closed
Which made no sense, as it's just a counter
The hostess had major attitude and somehow I didn't quite believe her
So I took my business elsewhere and don't plan on going back any time soon
especially when someone else is paying! The food is truly incredible
As far as the previous reviewers comments about selective seating go, I think it's possible that she were mistaken
Nobu ND's hosts typically take down your cell phone number and call when a table is ready -- so it is not unusual to see people breeze in once they've gotten a call
My boyfriend and I decided to go to NDN last Thursday evening
We we arrived, we saw a couple of empty tables
But, the maitre'd told us that the wait would be about 30 mins
When we told him that we'd wait, he said maybe even 45 mins
We were OK with that as well since there aren't many restaurants we could go in the neighborhood
While we were waiting outside, we noticed that there was no one else waiting outside
Plus, there were several people that walked in and got seated right away
As they had a first come first serve policy, we thought it was really weird that they didn't have to wait either
We then realized that the people were slipping the maitre'd money!  Although the food here is good, slipping the maitre'd money is something i would NEVER succumb to
Next Door Nobu is just as delicious as regular Nobu
Reservations are also a bit easier to obtain here too
Larger groups are easier to accomodate also
You can't go wrong with Nobu
Last time I went I saw Robin Williams there
I had to wait 3 months last time I wanted to eat at Nobu
Love this amazing food
The salad with seared tuna was amazing  The specialty cocktails are worth tasting and the Saki selection is better than most Japanese restaurants in the city
The Scene Kori is remarkable for its attention to detail on the part of the waitstaff, the chef and the decorator
At the front of the narrow, high-ceilinged restaurant is the attractive bar; moving onward, one sees expansive rust-colored walls, exposed ductwork and an attractive clientele bent over fine handmade bowls
The Food The serious, well-executed Korean dishes are fine-tuned somewhat for the Tribeca palate--a bit prettier and less spicy than uptown or Queens versions
The bulgogi (marinated grilled beef wrapped in lettuce) is delicious--smoky, subtle and refreshing
A version of bibimbop concocted with "mountain vegetables and roots" is a lighter dish that offers a thrilling combination of flavors and textures
Jap che, a dish of glassy noodles with vegetables stir-fried in a brown sauce, has a delicate flavor
Starters, including batter-fried stuffed sesame leaves, are light and appetizing
Great place, great food, great drinks, great service! Been there with another couple and we really enjoyed ourselves, places is quiet but not too romantic
Try the Ginger Kamikaze, yummy! and the tuna tartar for appetizer
I'm a native Korean, and the food is just whatever
Nothing about it stands out
For more authentic Korean cuisine, go to Koreatown
That said, the food wasn't too bad, the ambiance is quite nice
The ceilings are very high, and the walls are painted a rich, layered earthy tone
The lighting is nice, and it just overall is a nice place to go on a friendly-to-slightly-romantic date
Also, it didn't seem to get crowded easily during the weekdays
Can not beat their lunch box special
Meat, fish or poultry w/ noodles, salda, roll, rice
very filling and tasty
Good for lunch but not dinner quality
I know practically nothing about Korean food, and was pleasently surprised by the delicious food
Servce was adequate
I will go again
Kori is cute
It's a well designed warm little tunnel of a restaurant with quality Korean comfort food (bimbimbop and short ribs stand out) and some non-traditional dishes that are inventive
The waitstaff is tiny as is the place itself, sometimes friendly, other times not
This fact, depending upon your attitude toward paying kind of a lot for a little (a New York mandate) will determine how annoyed you may be at times
Still the food is worth a bit of staff indifference
At least they're not fabu-rude, something most area waitstaff excels at
The real downside is that the bar seats five people comfortably, which is too bad because the bartenders mix a drink well
For Tribeca this place is a bit of a find, ambience and menu wise
I've been to Kori many times, and have never had nor experienced what the last reviewer experienced
Some of my favorites there are the calamari, bulgogi, and bipimbap
Reasonable prices for a restaurant in TriBeCa
If you're at the bar, say hi to Fred
He makes some very good drinks
I went there and had an extremely hostile, inept waitress
I had to seat myself
She barely waited for us to sit down before asking for our order, refused to give us happy hour prices because we were at a table (only because the bar was packed) and then we waited 40 min for the check
I added up the tip incorrectly, but rather than ask me if I made a mistake or if there was something wrong with the service, she chased me down, screamed at me in front of all the other customers
I was embarassed enough that I added wrong, but it was in poor taste to chase down a customer and yell at them over a tip
She publicly shamed me into giving her more than she deserved
I always loved Kori but will never go there again
Eat at the bar if you must go
I love Kori
For a while I was going every week
The Ginger Kamikazees are absolutely delicious
I usually just have appetizers (the scallion or seafood pancakes are great) but I have had both the short ribs and the bibimbop, which were both excellent
I would go here any time I'm in the neighborhood
Another bonus: It's right next to the Knitting Factory, so it's a good place to stop by before a show for a bite to eat
Dined there on a Saturday night, and was pleasantly surprised by a delicious meal
We had two entrees - the bimbim bop and a short rib casserole with dates, mushrooms, root vegetables and other flavors in a beef broth
Both dishes were excellent but I would especially recommend the hot bimbim bop with vegetables
They let us substitute tofu for beef in the hot bimbim bop since our other dish had beef
Nice portions and staff too!
I am an intern at City Hall in NYC, and I go to Kori every day for lunch since it is so close by
The grilled shrimp salad is an absolute favorite of mine
With grilled shrip, salad with a special oriental dressing, ginger, and sticky rice, it is delicious
Kori is an upscale restaurant that is comfortable enough to feel relaxed in
The wait staff is friendly and cool
I highly recommed Kori!
In Short The exposed brick, archways and iron candelabras conjure a gothic Spanish taverna for the sangria-guzzling after-work crowds blowing off workday steam
When taking a break between pitchers, the suited-up groups also indulge in more than four dozen offerings of tapas, from the familiar chorizo chunks to the more exotic mofongo (mashed plantains with shrimp)
There's also a broad selection of paella, meat and fish entrees for those with heartier appetites
Working in Tribeca I've been here a few times
The food is always good the sangria ia always great
The place has a great vibe whether it'a on the patio during the day or inside listening to the music at night
Try seafood salad you won't be disappointed
I went here with an associate director and another co-worker
This is a great place to order a numerous amount of small dishes and share
If sharing is not your thing- try their sangria
Make reservations
Upon entering the space, the atmosphere consumes you; the dimly lit room has exposed brick walls covered with small candles and spanish artwork
There's a long bar which serves the full menu and a bunch of tightly-packed tables consume the remaining floor space
While it is quite tight, the food is delicious

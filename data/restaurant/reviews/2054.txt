This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in my life
The food was phenominal, beef wellington to die for
The atmosphere was very romantic, our own little table in the corner, very quiet
Service was excellent
Dinner was very pricey, but it is worth it for a special occasion
So far, OIBL,TIBS is the best cuilinary experience that either I or my finacee have experienced
We opted for the tasting menu, a nice option that many more restaurants should provide, with the wine option
The salmon was quite nice, but once they brought the lobster second course, we achieved nirvana
The beef wellington was beyond description; the desserts I won't even profane with mere language
The room was very romantic (though I would have preferred to be downstairs) and the staff was dedicated to the overall experience
Nice
We'll be back and will recommend this one to our most special friends
went Sat for the first time via surprise from my wife on my birthday
food was exceptionally good and quite reasonable
the place is beautiful and quite romantic
one caution upstairs is Siberia i
e
, no view, no ambiance, slow service
Sorry folks but this is strictly for those who travel into Manhattan for special occasions
If you are under 24 this might seem to be a great place in the big city but for the rest of us it's just a liitle too chheesy and the food is under par for the price
This is the first time I went to this restaurant, we were seated upstairs where I think is not as romantic as downstairs
So next time you may wanna request for a table downstairs
The place is nicely decorated and romantic
Service is not exceptionally good but decent
We had a 5 course tasting menu and all of them were great
I wouldn't say that the place is really the most romantic restaurant in nyc, but it is definitely worth a visit if you've never been there
The price is reasonable with all the great things
My girlfriend loved the place
The only cons is that the tables are located too closely, like the other person said, you could seat closer to someone you don't know than your lover
We got there a bit earlier than our reservation time
They seated us right away
We spent lovey 3 hours of fine dinning at the most romantic table
Yes, it is true not all the tables are in romantic setting
Beef Wellington was superb
Chocolate souffle is divine
Creme Brule was Orgasmic Highly highly recommanded
This used to be a good, romantic restaurant
The menu, service and atmosphere are outdated, boring and the food has gone steadily downhill
The 60's are over, guys
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at One if By Land, Two if By Sea
Everyone was extremely pleasant, accomodating, and helpful
It was a very romantic and cozy atmosphere - each table has roses, and a tall tapered candle which sets the mood, and many of the tables for two have seats next to each other rather than across
The service was prompt and knowledgable, but not overpowering
All of the food was fabulous, especially the desserts
Overall, it was a teriffic experience - we were made to feel very special, which makes it a great choice for special occasions
It was a rather expensive dinner, but it was worth every penny
I would recommend it to anyone!
The problem with this restaurant is that there are only about 6 romantic tables
Every other 2 person table is right next to another table
I was closer to the guy next to me than to my wife across the table
If you are from out of town insist on a window seat
We were seated well beyond our reservation time, and ignored for 15 minutes after we sat
The food was okay
To be able to visit this resturant for my 40th was indeed a treat
It was exceptionally busy, (the friday before christmas) but the food and service was excellent
We were in a side room, as the main dining area, appeared to be Black tie only
The venison truly melted in the mouth, the only service error was made with the supply of the wines, but was promptly corrected by the head waiter who supplied a complimentary wine with our main course
Excellent value - Well worth a return trip !!!
Been to One If By Land
several times now and each time it gets better and better
Ambiance is very good and while other reviews claim its romantic feel, it is a little bit crowded for romance
But I've never had better food - - from the beef wellington to the duck to the shrimp
The prix fix menu offers plenty of variety and while not cheap, provides great food for the price
I took my fiancee to the restaurant, the food and service were outstanding
The meal ended up costing about $400, but I would say it was well worthwhile
too expensive for little food, snotty service
i made reservations for my anniversary and was seating near a kitchen half an hour late
bus boys spoke no english and created a scene when we did not want to mix dairy and meat
bill was humongous, we were still hungry and went to figaros instead and had a great tiramisu
This gorgeous fully restored historic brownstone is one of our favorite places to celebrate a quiet romantic evening
Their signature Beef Wellington is fantastic, the ambience is unparalleled, and the roaring fire can't be beat!
The food is rich but not outstanding
The menu is somewhat dated
The winelist is outrageously expensive
And if you aren't getting engaged here you are out of place
OIBLTIBS is basing its success on its longstanding reputation as a romantic restaurant
Its day has come and gone
It is cliched now
My Wife I had the most pleasureable eating experience while dining at One If by Land Two If by Sea
From the very moment you enter through the Oak Door a new experience awaits you as you hear the lovely music of the piano playing soft melodies and are greeted by the Maitre d'
As he asked us our preference as to which table would we perfer we choose one near the window facing the fireplace
Our waiter Michael was very attentive to our needs throughout the evening and his recommendations of the fine selections of dishes on the menu made it an enjoyable culinary delight
The dessert menu made the evening complete as we both had the Creme brulee
We will surely be back to this fine establishment in the future and would recommend it highly to our friends and anyone that enjoys one of life's pleasures
I brought my boyfriend there for dinner for his birthday
We got a beautiful table in a quiet room with fireplaces
Our dinner was delicious
We had tasting menus (I think there were about 8 courses) and they paired wine with every course
At the end of the meal they brought the dessert out my boyfriend's plate was decorated for his birthday
I had just casually mentioned that to the reservationist and I guess she noted it and the staff followed through
Great service
Beautiful ambience
I would definitely recommend it
Tasting menu with wines is the best
Very intimate setting
We got engaged right after dinner
This might be the worst restaurant experience I had in the three years I lived in New York
We were seated upstairs, which has significatly less ambience than downstairs, under a wildly blowing air conditioner, with a massive oversized fake floral arrangement poking us in the heads
The waiter was nervous and barely competent
The food was obscenely overpriced even for NYC (though some of it was tasty)

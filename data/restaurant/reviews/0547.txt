Disclaimer: I grew up in Thailand and cook Thai myself
Even so, I realize that Thai food here is not what it is back home, and have tried to adjust my expectations
So maybe I am being too hard, but I found my noodles (Kwey Diel) were greasy and bland
The beef tasted hard and overcooked
My partner liked his Masaman curry, though, so maybe the cook just had a bad moment with my dish? We liked the size and interior of the place, though, and found the wait staff to be friendly and attentive
I would rate this as average and suggest that if you do go, try their curry, not their noodles
Hope you have better luck than I did
Well, we have to put in our vote for this spot, which somehow has gotten lost in the Saint Marks Pl restaurant shuffle
No plausible reason why this place is so empty! The food is great, the atmosphere relaxed, and the prices rock (they're even rounded to a whole number, so it's easier to add)
These people deserve congratulations and kudos and YOU should try them out
This quaint, nicely lit restaurant houses the best pad thai in the city! It's not overly greasy and oily like most pad thai I've had in the past
I would also recommend the green curry chicken
Although I'm convinced you can't really go wrong with choosing anything off the menu
And the prices are great as well!
If you're tired of the wait at Sea, but want something in the same genre/same neighborhood, I'd definitely recommend Why Curry
It's got great atmosphere, (unusual cozy dark lighting, interesting decor and rice bag pillows
) and the food is great
Only been here once on a weekday, and it wasn't crowded
Actually we were the only ones there, and I could not figure out why
The food was reasonably priced and very good
Entrees are less than $10 even for dinner
I eat a lot in the East Vilklage and find that Why Curry has the best lunch
You get salad, soup, and entree for about 7-8 bucks
Their pad thai is awesome -- very flavorful and the massaman curry is to die for
Very comfortable and friendly service make this a place I take clients who want East Village without the hint of patchouli hanging in the air
Tasty and rich in flavor curries make this place a delight! Minimal styling and rice-bag pillows in the window booths make it nice and cozy
Try the duck in curry sauce and you're in heaven
Not super-authentically Thai, but compared to the Thai-food wasteland in Manhattan, it's excellent
Very good basic curries
Presented nicely
The patrons are mostly college age which is why it's so cheap
I liked it
I have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes (at the most) of hanging up the phone
Food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!
I like the sandwiches
very much
The coffee is great
even the arctic mocha or whatever it's called
But the sandwiches are good
Every time I get the chicken, mozzarella, and vinigrette sandwich I leave full and very satisfied
The brownies are rich and tasty (get the dark ones) and they have s'mores
Good bread too
I recommend it, but I do hate that the Union Sq
location is no longer sit-down dining
It can be hard to get seating in any of the locations throughout Manhattan
It's good Xando's calls itself a coffee bar, because if it claimed to offer anything remotely tasty in the sandwich department, it could be sued for false advertising
Though it has a fair-sized list of both sandwiches, salads, and appetizers, the drinks are the only items really worthy of your attention
The oregon chai tea latte is something to be savored - a melody of ginger, nutmeg and a hint of honey
If you simply must have something to nibble on, go for the spreadables, a trio of dips served with crusty flatbread
Veer away fom the chicken cesar salad at all costs, as the lettuce deserves a funeral and the dressing often smells fishy
Other tha that, anjoy the mellow surroundings and enjoy a good cup of joe
Coffee is tough in this city if you're used to West Coast style strong brew
People, Starbucks isn't coffee, it's a trend, a brand
Xando actually serves up a decent cup when you're in search of something with a little more kick than average
Plus they often have comfy sofas when combined with the Cosi sandwich cafe
Definitely sidestep the big brand coffees for this east coast gem
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches
I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like
since the first time I came here I've been hooked
at first I consistently ordered the beef stew noodle with wonton (#14 on the menu), but almost 2 years have gone by and I've branched out to the other great selections
if you're looking for authentic hong kong-style food, look no further
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!
You know there are places where each time you go you want to try something new but always end up getting the same thing anyway
Well this is one of those places, they do about almost everything good but it is the beef stew with noodles that keep you coming back
I have been there many times and have always gotten the beef stew because it is so consistently good
Try the basket of fried chicken wings while you are there too
For $2
50 its a tasty deal that an't be beat
Maybe next time I will try something else
Unfortunately, we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport
My Salad Nicoise with Tuna was simply lettuce topped with a can of tuna, some canned sliced and pitted black olives on one side, 2 slices of tomato on the other, 2 slices of red pepper and a bread roll cut in half and balanced on top
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion
In fact, this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla
When she complained, the waitress said, Sorry
15% gratuity automatically added to the bill
Avoid at all costs
Terrible food, terrible service
Throroughly terrible
Only for tourists
Go to Red or **Quartino** instead
JP Mustards, at 22 Fulton St
, in South Street Seaport is the worst place I have ever been
Table and chairs were so dirty and gross - they were sticky
I witnessed the busboy clean a table
He just cleared it off and them brushed it down with a couple of USED napkins
The waitstaff, she was so rude! She threw our food at us, and never came back
At one point I noticed the grime on the mustard bottle and asked the waitress for a clean one
She stood before me wiped the bottle with a napkin and then put it back on the table and walked away
Our food was so bad we couldn't even finsih
My hot dogs were so old and gross
My friends chicken sandwich was worse than eating leather
The bill, soda: 2
50, a hotdog: 8
00
- and tip is included!!! A rip off!
In Short This lunch spot differentiates itself from other sub chains with its toasted bread-based creations loaded with gourmet ingredients like avocado and black Angus beef
Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more
Non-sandwich options include turkey-ranch and honey-mustard chicken salads, chili, clam chowder and other soups

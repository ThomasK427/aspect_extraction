Place was pretty much packed, but it wasn't very noisy
We enojoyed our dinner, food was superb and service is very attentive
Drinks at the bar, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and two bottles of Saint Emillion Grand Cru Bordeaux totalled $440 including tax and tips
Overall very good, a bit expensive
Great caviar and champagne
Very elegant, suprisingly not stuffy
Very cool place for a date
Friends and I visited Petrossian for dinner on a recent trip to NYC
We found the food to be inspired, the wait staff attentive but unobtrusive, and the surroundings quietly elegent
I'll go back the next time I'm in New York
The caviar can't be beat!
We stopped in the other night to have some drinks and ended up having tons of caviar, salmon, fois gras, and fun
Truly, the caviars and assorted fish roe are the best ever
It's very quiet and strangely welcoming
The Egg and Cheese on a bagel here is HUGE
Very filling
If you work in the upper times square area pick one up
As for the rest of the place its a regular bagel store, small space lots of people in and what yada yada
You have never had a bagel like this
Russian women stand in white coats before the fully smoked salmon
Their razor sharp knives expertly cut your portion carpacio thin and piled skyscraper high for your bagel
The size of the bagel is probably 1/3 larger than any bagel you have ever devoured
They are fresh, come with the standard tomato, onions and a nice touch of capers
Delic!
HORRIBLE FOOD ($10 for an egg wrap that sux?!) - HORRIBLE SERVICE (25 minute wait for a strawberry smoothie??) - RUDE RUDE RUDE WORKERS!!!(I don't care - that is not my problem Whatever direct quotes from staff members) This place should be shut down, locked up and NEVER PERMITTED TO HAVE CUSTOMERS EVER AGAIN
When I told the staff that I was displeased and wanted to write a letter to the owner, I was told the owner had no name and that I should just give the letter with no formal greeting (Dear Pick a Bagel Owner) to the cashier and that she would pass it along
Seriously? ARE THEY FOR REAL?   I have gone back time and time again, just hoping I had gone on a bad day and today is the day I never step foot in the place again
If you are looking to drop some weight - PICK A BAGEL is the place to be
If the food doesn't turn your stomach sour - your twisted mental state will surely ruin your appetite
BEWARE!
It wouldn't be my morning commute (or morning coffee break
or afternoon coffee break ;) without stopping at Phillips
They even know my order
They've catered some stuff for our office, too
The competitor with the green logo has opened two places around it and Philip's is still pretty packed
The Scene The handsome, simply appointed dining room has a circus-like atmosphere, with lots of "oohs" and "aahs," clanging of silverware and waiters who relish in talking up the different cuts of beef
The Food When you're ready, green-light the expert cutters by flipping the small disc at your place setting, and you're presented with rounds of pork ribs, short ribs, rib-eye, sirloin, flank steak, brisket, top round, special top round, chicken legs, sausage, pork loin, lamb and the oft-overlooked fish of the day
Most of the beef is nicely charred, teasingly salty and medium roasted so the slices are pink and moist
The poultry and pork loins are flavorful, and pork sausages remain juicy beneath a crisp exterior
I am a huge fan of Brazilian steakhouses
I usually go to Brazilia in the portuguese section of Newark which is always fantastic
I had heard about Churrascaria Plataforma and wondered if it could be as as good as Brazila and it wasnt
Not even close
I will say that the salad bar is 20 larger
You can get many items that you can not at Brazilia
But who goes for the salad bar
I go for the meat
And the meat was not even close to as good as Brazilia
And brazilia is half the price
It was good
But very expensive
Considering i can get much better and more authentic food at Brazilia, i would probably never visit Chrrascaria Platforma again
:-(
Having dined at several Brazilian Rodizio style steakhouses before, none come finer than this place in midtown's theatre district
The service is wonderful and active (running around the place), the food is rich but plentiful, and the selection of drinks / drinks are of good variety
The salad bar is a bit more decked out than the other Brazilian style places I've been to, with a salad items, pasta dishes, and even sashimi / sushi (the toro is fabulous)
Price is not cheap, as in most Rodizio style places, they are a bit up there
However, the ambiance of live music, spacious tables make this an ideal setting for groups and dates alike
Worth the trip at least once if one is willing to shell out a hefty price for a great experience
The place is loud and busy
But if you can find a way to avoid gorging on the delicious salad bar items, you can save room in your stomach for an endless stream of meat
I especially like the skirt steak, which I always request as soon as I get seated
The little Brazilian cheese breads are highly addictive, so beware
And the sangria is very good as well
Altogether, a great dining experience and a great place to take a group of people whom you want to impress
Went to dine at Chur the other night and it was excellent
The food was delicious, the staff very curtious
The decor very nice
The cons I would say were there were some people dressed nicely, while others came in to dine in a sweatshirt or with cell phones in their ears
Definately a turn off
The drinks are over priced in my book as well
All in all a very nice dinging experience
I will definately go back again
Being rather fussy about my meat, its rare I find a prime rib that measures up which is saying a lot as i frequent places like Luger and Mortons
The prime rib here is far and away worth any price and being far less than the downtown restaurants makes it more than worth it
My group arrived before the restaurant was opened but the sgtaff greated us warmly and then we began to eat and eat and eat
the salad bar had great black beans and pork and then the service of the endless meats began
top sirloin, chicken, bacon wrapped filets, pork, lamb, and then more steak
all served with flair
It is pricey for lunch but
the wait staff were all polite and attentive
and the food was well-flavored and different
A definite +++ for this place
you have to live with the saying you get what you pay for when you come to this restaurant
sure it's a little pricey at $50 per head, but the quality of food you get is unbelievable
every single dish @ plataforma was great (especially the cheese bread and plantains) and the steaks were awesome
service was good
The only con i can think of really is the lack of variety at the buffet
mostly seafood and salads
if you need to celebrate a birthday with family or a few friends, this is definetly a place you can go to
I loved it, loved it, loved it! My boyfriend took me there once considering that i am a meat connoisseur, far from being a vegetarian :) That was the best present ever! Great atmosphere
So many kinds of meat! Each one so delicious that you cant say no to any
The waiters started smiling at me in the end, because really - you have to be reasonable there :) otherwise you are in danger of never leaving the place!
I agree with all the positive reviews about this restaurant that motivated me to try this restaurant for my friend John's birthday dinner
We had the best time
Listen to all the advice listed on the other reviews
Drinks, refills, and desserts all cost extra
The appetizer bar is amazing but not as amazing as the entree options
Most of us agreed we should have minimized the appetizer if not skipped it all together
Even though I am on a restricted budget, I will be back to Churrascaria Plataforma many more times

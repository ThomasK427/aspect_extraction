The waiters were arrogant, they took their time
The food was horrible for the price
Both my friends ordered their steaks well done, but they were so thick, all the steaks came out rare anyways
The baby rack of lamb came out burnt
There are no sides with the steaks, each additional side cost $6 or more
for fries!! The best thing on the menu was probably the creamed spinach side and that's saying alot for a steakhouse
Its supposed to be the steak that comes out tops
For the price, go somewhere else
Horrible
We were a party of six, and all six of us felt very cheated
Money churning tourist trap
It took them about 45 minutes to seat us
The service was so slow and not helpful
The food was average or worse
Extremely disappointing!
I had the pleasure of dining the The Old Homestead on one occasion while visiting NYC in March 2003
It is quite simply the best steakhouse I've eaten in
Everything about this restaurant is total class
The food, service, selection EVERYTHING
Having read some of the negative reviews about quality value for money all I can say is come to Ireland where you'll be truly ripped off and you'll see how good this restaurant is
I have to say in all honesty the meal was good, the steak and prime ribs were made as ordered and the sides were tasty
The service left quite a bit to be desired, I was not impress at all, for the amount of money that was spent
If you pay the top end for a meal you expect NO demand top end in service
If you want to impress guest or yourself, stick with Luger
It took us 40 min to get a menu
Once our orders came, there was something wrong with every dish
Waiter mixed up orders for 2 of my friend's steaks, one wanted medium rear the other medium well
Outside of the steaks were burned beyond belief and had a distinct taste smell of burned rubber
Exception was the Prime Rib, which looked like they just boiled it
What used to be a wonderful New York institution has turned into a third rate restaurant that is more interested in taking your money than providing you with a memorable meal
After arriving on time for our reservations we were made to sit at the bar for over an hour and buy over priced drinks
With not even a word of apology we were paraded to a table where we had slow and arrogant service
The food was mediocre at best
You can find better steaks at better prices and have a better time at many other steakhouses
Even tourists should be warned
You feel like you've been too long in the homestead when you compare this old place to thenew ones in town
Tourists love it for some reason and hence the high ratings
Not up to par with others like Morton's,Palm, Luger
Old Homestead is my favorite steakhouse
I've been there many times over the past 2 years and everyone enjoys it
The waiters are very professional and attentive
The food is fantastic, aps
, sidedishes and steaks all great
I took my boyfriend there for his birthday, he got the biggest single serve steak available, we each had an appetizer, i had a glass of wine and the meal cost about $110, which is good for a great NYC resturant
Definitely worth checking out
so you're going to take premium AMERICAN kobe beef, grind it up and serve it up for $42
00, whatever you need to do to keep your doors open! with such poor service, kinda makes you wonder how they've been around so long
The Kobe Burger is something worth doing once, but not something that knocks your socks off
The Gotham Steak on the other hand was amazing
There are a few others who throw a prime rib on the grill, but the Old Homestead really does a nice job
Our raw bar selection was good and fresh and the potatoes, spinach and mushrooms were the perfect compliment for a faboulous dinner
Old Homestead has made some new fans, we'll surely be back
My parents love steak so on there 38th wedding anniversary my husband and I planned a night out, 2 1/2 hours later we all left there very dissapointed
The porterhouse was dry, overcooked, and luke warm
On top of that we recieved our side dish about 15 minutes after we recieved our main courses
All I can say is this place is overrated and should re-evaluate call themselves a true steakhouse! This could make a meat eater go vegetarian
Sorry, these new yorkers are banning the homestead next year I'll cook the anniversary dinner
Let me first say that I dine at the Old Homestead every December
Don't ask me how this tradition started, but it continues
December 2002 was no exception
The Heavy Cut Sirloin was very good, but not the over the top best in New York like I have experienced in years past
The salads are terrible and overpriced, and are to be avoided at all costs
The Beef Carpaccio (That's raw beef, thinly sliced for you tourists) is always an outstanding appetizer
Service is hit or miss, but that's NY
I still prefer the menu and ambiance BEFORE the redo several years ago
My husband and I enjoy dining in New York and the Homestead is our favorite
Ceasar is the waiter we request every time we visit
I love a man that remembers the way I drink my martini
The dress is casual and the food is enough for four
Unlike some other steakhouses, they accept all credit cards and cash, not just their own
the best thickest,juicest,largest cooked to perfection prime rib
I'M 44 years old and my dad took me there in 1974 when i was 16
I haven't found a prime rib to date that compares
hats off to those brothers
Until 5 years ago the Old Homestead was a piece of my family tradition
One of the buildings that house the Old Homestead belonged to my family for over 40 years
We also owned and managed a meat packing company next door
So as a youth I enjoyed many a meal at the homestead
Great to see that they are still a favorite

We stumbled upon this place walking home one night and it may be our favorite steak house in the city
Appetizers very good and good size portions, steaks were unreal! Early crowd is subdued and as the night goes on it gets a little more lively
Typical, but fair prices for a steakhouse
not one week after dining at this old favorite im still wondering why i stuck around after i was shown the incorrect bottle of wine - 2x !!! food was average but the service really made it an evening ill never forget
i dont know when it got soo bad but the new homestead has been forever crossed off my list
I went to the Old Homestead this past Sunday for dinner
After reading the reviews given by other citisearch users I thought the steak would be alot better
We ordered the porterhouse for two Medium and the inside was cold
We have been to Luger's, Ruth Chris, Sparks, Red Eye Grill, and compared to these
I thought for the price
it was just o
k
Although it is deceiving from the outside, the restaurant inside is very nice
The service was a little unorganized
Maybe we went on a off night, but for these prices eveything should be perfect
I don't think I will be back, there are alot of other Great Steakhouses in better parts of Manhattan
The ambience was very romantic, Merlot Robert Sinskey 'Reserve' Napa 1997, outstanding and the Steaks magnifique! Highly recommend it!!!!  Mrs

The food here was fanstatic and the portions were big
The shrimp are truly HUGE!! The service was slow but the amount of food you get, plan on taking your time and enjoying it

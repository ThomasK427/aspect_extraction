The piano guy isn't there all the time, but when he is it's a great addition to the meal
Definietly a great place to sit down and eat if you're in the area--right off of Queens Blvd
The Scene Opened in 1993, Nick's may be the only great pizza place in the city of New York that isn't older than most of the people who eat there
The interior is clean and spacious, with wood floors and high ceilings
Framed black-and-white shots of old Forest Hills hang from the walls and a gleaming, flame-spewing pizza oven sits in back
The Food The secret to Nick's pizza is the sublime crust, which arrives caked in soot
It has a consistency similar to that of naan and remains good even as it cools
Fresh-tasting tomato sauce and plentiful slabs of thick mozzarella show equal mastery, while toppings are fresh and wide-ranging
A focused staff adds to the experience, doing small but important things like delivering extra napkins when necessary
nick's crust is different
secondly, the crust is almost paper thin and the crust bottom is burnt looking, but it goes well with the sauce and the cheese
The sauce of nick's pizza is amazing
Having been to many authentic italian pizzerias (naples 45, lombardis, patsys etc), I can say that nick's pizza is probably the best pizza in nyc
The sauce beats everybody elses
It's tangy intense tomato flavor and very acidic
Take a nexium pill before
This is authentic italian style
It doesn't have very much cheese and they use fresh mozzarella that looks different from the regular pizzeria cheese
The pizza is mostly sauce, with a few slices of mozzarella melted on and some fresh basil leaves scattered on top
A thing of beauty
But be ready to pay extra to get some grated cheese and they don't have any garlic powder
This is GREAT pizza for fans of brick oven pizza
The crust has that just right crispiness, and the toppings are fresh
The only drawback is it can get rather pricey, especially if you add on the toppings
I love Nick's pizza loaded with veggies and pepperoni
The cheese on their pies is the best! You have to eat in because the pizza is best fresh out of the oven
I MADE THE TRIP TO NICKS AND WAS VERY UPSET
THE PIZZA WAS BURNT AND THERE WAS NO CHEESE
THE WAITRESS BROUGHT THE WRONG PIZZA, THE WRONG SALAD, AND FORGOT THE DRINKS
HOWEVER SHE DID NOT FORGET TO CHARGE ME EXTRA FOR PARM CHEESE
After trying Many pizza restaurants in NYC we've come to the conclusion that Nicks is the absolute best
You need to trek to Forest Hills but it's worth it
Lombardi's comes close but Nicks is just a notch above
Also Lombardis can be a bit inconsistant
As far as John's, Patsy's, Grimaldi's
What are people thinking? John's on Bleeker is probably one of the worst pizza experiences I''ve had
Grimaldi's is such a tourest trap and the pies are not even as good as Lombardi's
Nick's is only pies
No slices
But for slices we have Di Fara's so it's all good
Great Pizza I love since they opened few years now and it never change and that is great , I just heard that they are opening a new location in Manhattan on Stone Street (wall street Area) This street is so Europeen looking +a great Pizza That is going to be an inexpensive trip to Italia!!! Can't wait
Nick's Pizza is worth the subway ride! Forest Hills is a shopping and strolling mecca
Try a little shopping and then Nick's pizza and a stroll through the quaint treelined streets of Forest Hills Gardens right around the corner
Great salads! they have an unbelievable calzone that is also great! pizza was thin and tasty although a bit too limp for my taste
This is the best pizza in Forest Hills
It is nice enough to enjoy as a nice meal
The brick oven pizza is perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sauce and cheese
Toppings are well prepared and in the correct quantity
The only downside can be the wait
Take out is available, but not delivery
No reservations either
fresh and tasty
the crust is thin and the sauce is tomatoey!!
Nick's Pizzeria is a very good envioremental restaurant with a decent food
Nick's Pizza is simply fabulous
While I have eaten John's Pizza several times over the past few years (the new Broadway location is beautiful but the pizza isn't as good as the Bleecker St location so why bother), Nick's remains consistent
It never disappoints
Their salads are delicious too!
I can now walk to the Grimaldi's from home but lived in Forest Hills for 5 years
Nick's is jusy better
THis is an easy to find little place that has the best brick oven, Pizza
Really, it is so good, and so fresh you will wonder why other restaurnats can't get it right
Sure, the menu is limited - but it does not need to be deep
Simple works, you'll see
Good Service, often crowded, great pizza
And it is in Forest Hills not Flushing as indicated
Price is also right
Pizza at Nick's is light, satisfying and made to suit your eclectic taste
You may choose your own toppings which come arranged on a thin, crisp dough
There should be more choices of items to load on the pie, still quality of their classic pizza is a slice above
Service pleasant, fast and helpful, but not overbearing
The best thing to eat after a long day of work--Nick's Pizza
Big Nicks on the Upper West side is the perfect pizza
It is delicious, oozes, and amazing
It's a sad, sad day in New York when by the best pizza you can buy is hidden in the byways of Forest Hills, Queens, but break out that backpack and hop on that train cuz the bounty ahead is well worth the trek
The crust is super thin, smokey and perfectly crisp; the sauce has a rich flavor with just enough sass to satify those lower taste buds; and the fresh handmade mozzarella pulls it all together without masking the other flavors
I've been to the rest, and while Grimaldis may sate my fix, Nick Angelis' pies leave me in awe and wonder
The joint may be tiny and a bit non-descript, but check out those snazzy tin ceilings, and dig in to the bounty
I read that this was one of the best places in NYC to eat pizza
What is the deal people??? It's decent but there is so much better
If you are a fan of the thin crust, this is a good pizza($2 for a topping is a bit much)
We had terrific service(wasn't crowded) and a great salad
I live only a couple of blocks of this great pizzaria
I used to go every day after school when I was in 6th grade
now its more like a hang out with my friends
Read the previous review and just happened to be going to Forest Hills the following week
Turns out, everyone in that neighborhood knows about this place
Nothing too special about the location or the atmosphere, but DAMN, the pizza is good
Sort of thin, sort of crispy, sort of sweet, sort of tangy, but EXACTLY what NY pizza is supposed to be
There are too many poseurs in the city now who load up the pizza with all kinds of crap
Lillian's has plain slices which are out of this world
This is the best pizza!! We compare every place to A J Pizza!!
Great food, great neighborhood! This is one of the best pizzeria's in all of NYC
Gotta try it!
Great thin crust pizza
Very crispy!   Good place to have a quick bite in Forest Hills
The Scene Everything charming and naive about small-town America condenses into this early 1900s-era ice cream joint in Forest Hills
Piglets of all ages congregate here for a scoop or two (or three) of Eddie's homemade ice cream, topped with house syrups or blended into shakes
Aloof teenage boys in backwards baseball caps serve up the heavenly goods while grandparents and their hyperactive grandchildren excitedly slurp out
The Draw The atmosphere is a psychedelic time warp, but it's really the sundaes that make the trip worth it

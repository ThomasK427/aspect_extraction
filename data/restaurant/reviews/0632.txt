The menu may be small, but the food is straight forward with uncomplicated preparations
Our server was bright, cheery and very knowledgeable
Branzini is an excellent twist on the typical trattoria
While the limited menu holds no surprises when you read it, the generous portions and exceptional flavors are impressive and robust
Chef/owner Rick Moonen has done wonders, turning the predictable Manhattan trattoria into something far more sophisticated under the surface
Well looks like the NY Times finally uncovered this little gem
Probably won't be as easy to get in now
Great simple dishes and pastas and I agree with Grimes - fantastic Crab Cake! Also went to a cocktail party there on the 14th floor, fabulous space
Staying at the Library Hotel I was kindly steered to Branzini
Could not have been more welcomed and relaxed
Pristinely fresh sardines, wonderful wines to compliment
Veal and eponymous Branzino showed restraint and confidence
dine out alot and respect value and thoughtful execution
Recent reviews about this fabulous restaurant must have been written by diners more interested in having their egos stroked by overly solicitous waitstaff and management than enjoying a great meal in a cozy and romantic space
My experience here was quite different
Great food, especially the pasta
And if the mean manager was the handsome and charming man in the suit that offered to help us choose the perfect wine with our dinner, then may I suggest that you wait to dine until after your commute back to Greenwich, where restaurants are in the business of catering to whining children
I had friends in from out of town for the holiday weekend and took them here
What a mistake
I can't beleive Citysearch said this was a hot new restaurant
It was anything but hot with a diner-like atmosphere, so-so food, bad management and to top it off, very expensive for what you get
I agree with the other negative reviews
DO NOT GO HERE
There are much better restaurants
We were staying at the Library Hotel above Branzini, and have looked at the menu a few times in the past, but never gone in
This time we had to grab a quick local lunch so we figured what the heck
All I can say is we will SURELY be back! It ia a resonable priced place that served wonderful seafood! The grilled sardines were fantastic, as well as the namesake grilled branzini
We stay at the Library Hotel often and this has now become our local place, AND we can have this great food delivered to us as room service there!!! WE WILL BE BACK!
Wow! The mushroom penne at Branzini blew me away! It was awesome, fresh, perfect pasta
My friend had the cavatelli, which she raved about as well
The atmosphere is nice -- it's a good lunch or dinner spot with a warm, casual feel and good service
I'd highly recommend it, especially if you want pasta that's a cut above
you won't away feeling dissapointed!
Starting with Marvelous cocktails our party of six had an outstanding casual dinner
For an appetizer my I suggest that you try their dates wrapped with prosciutto it was excellent! The food was great and the staff very tentative but not in your face
Everyone in our party enjoyed ourselves so much that we skipped our after dinner show plans
Recently ate at the new Branzini
Rick Moonen, the old chef from Oceana is now in charge here and it shows
The paella is really good and nothing can beat the pasta with the sausage, I really enjoyed it! What was really nice was that we ate at night and it was so quiet in the restaurant
There were very few tables occupied (it was about 8:30pm)
At first this made me skeptical, but evidently they do quite a large lunch crowd
Great place for a date!
I love the new menu at Branzini! The salads, the seafood and the pastas are all sublime
If you love to dine out, but hate the calories, one of their gorgeous salads plus a Small Plate is the perfect size meal
If you dont mind the calories, I highly recommend the lemon cheesecake with blueberries and the best capucino I had every had
Good food, nice atmosphere, excellent host / waitstaff
Quiet neighborhood allows for outdoor dining
Was staying at the Library Hotel and needed to get something to eat
Vigneti is right off the lobby
The food was amazingly good, the staff was very friendly but a bit slow
And then the bill came
OH MY GOD! Two people having a multi-course dinner in Midtown Manhattan involving excellent food and it all came in under $50!!! Plus, because we were guests of the hotel, we got a bottle of wine with dinner
You can't beat that
Amazing change of pace from the moorish Upper East Side type spot
Splendid martinis and Cool Ambience
Also, free panini with drink orders on Monday evenings (Although you do have to ask for this unadvertised special)
I've been here several times but last night (3/25/06) was the worst
Our waitress had four tables plus ours - a total of 7 people and she made four mistakes with our order and then lost my credit card for about 10 minutes - I know I've said I won't go again but this time I mean it - $80 for paninis and wine is hard enough without incredibly poor service - if you go prepare to wait and/or get up and constantly ask for what you need
Inexcusable
The food here is downright delicious
We had the pizza, bruschetta, paninis, and the salad
The wine list needs a little updating but satisfactory
Good vibe
Unfortunately the service was terrible
The waiter's favorite customers/friends showed up and we were promptly ignored, meals were 40 minutes late, check was 30 mins late
If you go to Vero, you MUST order the bruschetta and chopped salad with chicken
And while you're at it--try a panini or two as well
The white bean bruschetta is unforgettable
While the music can get loud at times, the restaurant is cozy and the fruity drink list can keep you occupied for hours
I was pleasantly surprised by how great Vero is
It looks tiny and unassuming from the outside
However, it is a very comfortable and pretty place to enjoy some wine and light food
I went with friends, but it looks like a great date place, too - very romantic
Great wines, great food and very reasonable prices - highly recommended!
Visited there only once (but will be back!), the service (bar) is great, the wine list is really nice (goes far beyond the usual boring California Chardonney/Pinot Grigio/Zinfandel/Merlot selection)
Don't expect a full italian menu, but the Panini, Appetizers and Pasta looks really good (had Pasta - very tasty)
Ambience is a little Soho'ish
This restaurant stands out from the crowd and will be my favorite in the area
The worst service I have ever had - entered the restaurant and waited at the door for 5 minutes before deciding to push our way past the extremely small bar to find a waitress
No hostess in sight
Waitress confronted us by asking us where are you gonna sit? Then said we could sit at next available table
Meanwhile there were 3 tables pushed together that she said were for a reservation
Two people walked in behind us that knew the bartender (owner) and he shouted to the waitress (over our heads no less!) to seat his friends
So she pulled one table from the reserved table to seat them
If that's how you think you stay in business, you're highly mistaken! Never again
I was thrown a 30th surprise party at Vero, and it was the perfect setting for a warm, intimate gathering
My guests all raved about the food and superb service
I've been back on a number of occasions for drinks and cappucino
I love the atmosphere
It's the perfect place to enjoy the company you're with
And the hosts and bartender make you feel like so welcome
Plus, I challenge you to find a better cappuccino than the one David makes (make sure you add the bailey's!)
there was nothing but sports bars left on the UES, there is VERO
this wine and panini bar is so cozy and sexy you'll wonder how you ever did without it
the wine list is well-rounded and the paninis, delecious
run don't walk
I went here with some friends for a few drinks and was shocked that such a trendy and sultry place existed on the upper east
The drinks were AMAZING (try the martinis and margaritas) and the staff totally not pretentious
My party had the perfect evening listening to sexy grooves, chowing on their specialty paninis and DRINKING night away
It is hands down the coolest spot uptown

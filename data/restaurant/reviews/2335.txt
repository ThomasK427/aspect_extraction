There is sure to be something on the menu for all tastes - if not, there are two other resturants below that will not disappoint
If nothing else, this is an excellent place to split a bottle of wine and people-watch
The corner of 60th and 3rd takes on a different perspective from 25 feet up
Get a window seat in the summer when everything is opened up
If only Mark's could get it together! The service is impeccable, but the lighting is horrific
The hotel is gorgeous, but the restaurant is empty (we went during restaurant week)
The appetizers were delightful, the entree only okay
At 8:30pm on a Thursday night we were one of three tables occupied in the restaurant
The winter roll and crispy egg were unforgettable, the pinot noir beef entree too salty and a bit rough
Hazelnut nougat and grapefruit dessert were yummy but forgettable
Hopefully, the establishment will re-think their lighting as well as get a crowd
Until then, I doubt I will return
Steakhouse with your traditional menu of lobster, mashed potatoes and steaks but everything is really good
The wine list is notable and great California reds
I was inspired to go from a review on chefschoiceny
com and I brought a date here and he returned with with cowokers, and I returned with friends
The fried calamari is out of sight, crispy, and fresh
The male waiters are experienced and treat you like a king
Off the beaten path, but worth it, in Historic area with cobblestone streets and parking
The setting is warm and romantic
The tables are not too close together
The Mark is a beautiful hotel
The food was excellent, but portions (especially appetizers) are very small
Service was very gracious
It's a really nice bar, but for being on of the best hotel bars in the city, it was lacking
people specifically! Saturday night my friend and I were one of 5 in the entire bar
My husband and I have really enjoyed dinner at Mark's Restaurtant
The food is exellent, and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed
Very enjoyable!
Taiyo is great, a hidden gem
I ate there for the first time recently, and had a fantastic meal of fresh, creative sushi with generous portions of fresh fish and seafood
Their menu has an excellent selection of sushi and Japanese food items, appetizers, entrees, desserts, as well as unique house specials, all of which were superb
I highly recommend Taiyo if you have not been there yet! Taiyo offers great variety, high quality food, and friendly service at an affordable price
The Scene The colorful mismatched tables, sturdy second-hand chairs and decorative Spanish knickknacks aren't why patrons flock to this inexpensive eatery
In fact, few customers actually stay to eat, which is why the takeout counter is sectioned off from the casual dining area
In the evenings, Upper East Side families bring their broods for $10 dinners
During the day, doctors, nurses and other staff from nearby New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center pop in for fast, satiating bites
The Food Although the Mexican menu is mundane--burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, nachos, salads, tacos--the execution is marvelous
The chicken mole is especially tangy and the creamy guacamole is made to order
Don't skip the sweet, powerfully potent sangrias, which arrive by the pitcher or the glass
Homemade flan or rice pudding leaves a sweet aftertaste, assuming you have room to indulge
Ever since the manager bought this place it really gets better every day
I been going here for years and have seen the changes, but the one thing that hasn't change is the great food and warm and friendly service you get every time
Go in and ask for the owner, he'll come out with a smile and a great story
get the grilled chix and veggie burrito
you cant go wrong
Mexican food I've ever had
I live on the block, gave this place a second chance, after two bites, I tossed it
I honestly don't know how this place stays in business
Great place for lunch! Healthy and fresh Mexican food- I love the spinach quesadilla
Also, the staff is pretty friendly
The food at this cozy little joint is FANTASTIC ! Their homemade salsas are to die for
I always go for the Pork Tinga
You're missing out if you don't hit 879 TACO !
This was our favorite place to eat and get take out from during our 6 years living in NYC
The Picadillo Burrito is the best we've ever had, and the authentic Mexican beers go great with all the food selections
It's a regular stop for us whenever we visit NY now! The owners are fantastic and even gave us a meal on the house when we moved from the area!
Great food
The cheese enchilada with tomatillo sauce is my favorite
The decor is simple, take out counter at the entrance, tables had painted by school children
A very quiet and comfortable environment
I go to Lenox Hill Diner at least once a week with my family
I have 6 people in my family and everyone in my family loves it
The burgers are the best part of all
I have eaten the same thing for the last year
Family Oriented
My husband and I have been to Manhattan Grille a number of times and love the ambience
It has an old school country club type feel and the staff is always very attentive and friendly
The side dishes and fish are excellent here, but, sadly, the steaks always seem to disappoint
When I get the filet,medium rare it always seems to be blackened (I don't mind a good sear, but burnt and black is not good), and the last few times the meat has been very tough and chewy
The hash browns are excellent and so are all the veggie sides, but if you want steak there are too many other really great steak places in the city for about the same money to waste time here
I have eaten at Manhattan Grille many times since it was established, and I have never been disappointed
It is always a completely satisfying dining experience
The entire staff goes the extra mile to please you
The Manhattan Grille has become my favorite restaurant in Manhattan
Every trip I make to the city includes at least one visit to this steakhouse
The service is excellant
The employees are friendly
The steaks are fantastic, as are the appetizers and the desserts
Had it not been for another neighborhood restaurant closing, I might never have discovered this restaurant
It's a gem!
I've always hoped to make enough money to be able to sit at a dark wood booth in the corner of an Olde-World steakhouse, with Sinatra crooning in the background, and chowing down on a fantastic steak
This is the place I dream of leapt to life
Pricey? Yes
Noisy, overrated, rude and a letdown? No, no, no and no
Waitstaff treats you like the only customer in the place, and there are plenty of nice big booths to sip your cocktail - with legroom to spare (try finding that at the Palm)
Go
Trust me
Try their pre-fixe menu and you will love it!!! salad, soup, main course, dessert and coffee
only for $21
95-$34
95
There's no corkage fee either
You can never go wrong:) ambience is expensive looking restaurant and the service is not bad
their ladies room is a hype too:) ive been here twice, our second waiter tried to fool us with the bill so just double check it when you get it
My boyfriend and I enjoyed a truly scrumptious meal at this fancy steakhouse
The menu offers a variety of different foods, and the quality of our steaks were above and beyond expected
I would truly recommend this restaurant to all the steak-lovers out there! Even though the dinner menu is somewhat pricey, it is well spent money for such delicious food
Our group of seven, including two teenagers and a 6-year-old, enjoyed our dinner here
Service was pleasant and attentive enough, not rushed

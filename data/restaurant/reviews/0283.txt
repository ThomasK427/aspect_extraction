In a town that praises itself for its worldliness and culinary savvy, such reviews are an flat-out disgrace
Calling this place good would be like having dirty-water hot dog stand food your whole life, going out to Applebee's and calling it gourmet
They have good dim sum with reasonable prices
My favorite is crab meat dumplings
I also like shu-mai, which comes with 2 shrimp and 2 pork filling
So one order of shu-mai gives you two flavors
There are some Chinese restaurants that I wish I spoke Chinese to order real authentic Chinese food, but not at this place
Everything is written/explained both in Chinese and English, and waiters are fairly attentive - if you are not sure what you've ordered, they'd tell you right away
The place is clean and well-kept
There is a water tank but no pile of bad looking lobsters, and the water looks clean
The best time to go during weekend is before 11am, so you can take your time to enjoy their food
Good place for families with small children, too
The food was pretty good but its just away overpriced
You can find much better places in China town
Walked in on Chinese New Year Sunday late in the afternoon, around 5 or 6 -- seating was not a problem the dim sum was deliciously fresh -- very likely a by-product of their not using carts
It's a little odd at first to order dim sum off a checklist, but the result is fantastic since the food is made to order
And yes, order in bulk -- you see your waiter once then never again
Not only is the dim sum selection poor, it's overpriced, and the quantity is laughable
One of the best meals we have ever had!!! So fresh, flavorful and overall fabulous!! For the price the food is truly the best value in experiencing quality, quality food!! I want to go back tonight again it was so good!!!
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great
But $1 for each small piece??? Not worth it
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill
After reading good reviews about Dim Sum Go Go, we took out-of-town guests to experience trendy dim sum
Instead of the copious, fresh dumplings and bite-sized treats we were expecting, we got greasy bones of meat, heavy buns and inedible dumplings
Don't know if we caught the restaurant on a bad night or if we ordered the wrong things, but our food was terrible and the service wasn't much better
Got a seat quick, and had some weird fill-out order form for a hard to understand menu
Maybe that's how it is in Chinatown
But anyway, the service was non-existant
Our waiter didn't say a word to us
I would've taken a little Chinese even if I didn't understand it
Sheesh
The dim sum assortment plate was interesting since each one was a surprise
They were good, but a tad expensive
Can't say much for decor
I liked the wall of aquariums though
Tasty but expensive
Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles
Very different than regular dimsum places
Usually 3 vs
4 items per dish
Okay service
Worth a visit
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say
They were such a rip-off ($8
95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner: (1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St
just south of bayard (2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal
This is place is great - exotic, interesting food at very cheap prices
I've tried the steamed shrimp dumplings in nearly every Chinatown dim sum restaurant and the ones here are my absolute favorites
You get a pot of delicious jasmine tea with your order and dining room has very fun modern decor, a little like sitting in a Target comercial
The food here is certainly a wild and experimental take on Chinese food
Most people going to Chinatown for a meal are not looking for something like this however
The portions were on the smaller size and more expensive than traditional fare
Most people familiar with regular Chinese food will leave hungry and probably a bit disappointed
The advantage of this place is the dim sum which you can get at any time unlike other Chinatown restaurants that serve it only from early morning through afternoon
But this comes at a cost, the dim sum is also much pricer than other restaurants in Chinatown
Unless you are looking for another perspective and modern art approach to Chinese food this is probably not what you were coming to Chinatown for
Excellent avant-garde chinese cuisine
Bears no resemblance to chow mein and won-ton soup
Dishes are very tasty, but light and memorable
Freshest dim sum in town
Highly recommended
I've been there half a dozen times with no change in quality
Very tasty dumplings!! whoever wrote the previous comment obviously didn't know what a true good Chinese food is supposed to be
Service was not the most fancy one I have ever seen but they are not rude and they were very friendly in their own way
One of the few places where you can have a good dim sum at night time!
The Scene When New York's only South African restaurant first opened back in 1999, a certain ramshackle charm evoked a night at the edge of the veldt
Since then, Madiba has more than doubled in size and replaced the kerosene lanterns with giant, colorful paintings of Africa
Food is served at wooden camping tables, and drinks come in small metal mugs
There's also a lounging area where bands and performance troupes entertain
The Food Unique dishes here include potjie (similar to oxtail stew), bunny chow (a hollowed-out loaf of bread containing vegetable curry) and bobotie (curried meat and boiled egg pie)--and that's just scratching the surface
The safari platter (dried meat sticks) and dark meats appeal to mainstream palates, while tender ostrich and tasty seafood dishes like octopus peri-peri are for more adventurous eaters
I've lived in the neighborhood for 7 years and I have always had a good time at Madiba
The service is really friendly - much more so than alot of other places in the area
The food is delicious and definitely different then everything else on the DeKalb strip
The only downside is that it's totally overpriced
$9 for a whiskey? You can get the same thing almost anywhere else for $6-8
I guess you're paying for the atmosphere but it's a bit much
Still, I go back every so often and always feel welcome
Being a South African I was excited to check out New York only South African restaurant
I should not have bothered, what a disappointment
You walk into an overcrowded space decorated in tourist kitsch which has the feel of a plastic, cheaply produced high school play
The bartender took about 10 minutes polishing glasses and trying to establish a cool South African attitude before he deigned to look in our direction
Of course there were no South African beers you could actually order - the multitude South African beer bottles behind the bar was there for decoration only
We ordered a Mojito and a Capirinha
The Mojito took 5 minutes
Then he proceded to make Sangria, serve wine etc
while ignoring us for another 10 minutes
I finally cancelled the order and was charged $16 for a very bland Mojito
Spare yourself and the one you love
Excelent place! I recomend to everybody that want to have a great night!
i think this place is authentic because the wait staff reminded me of the one person I sort of know from south africa
as well as charlize theron
nice but almost cynical, a bit too aware of themselves as south africans selling their identity as south africans and capitalizing on interest in south africa
i had some thing with shrimp and it was spicy, good

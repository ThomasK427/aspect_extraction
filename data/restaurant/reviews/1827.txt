Try the bread basket
Absolutely love it! The sights, the scene and the food
Lots of fun!
The best breakfast I have had in a long time
The service was attentive and the food was cooked exactly as we asked
I would definitely go back again
Thumbs up for the apple cinnamon pancakes, eggs, potatos/onions (their version of hash browns) and bacon (so GOOD)
We had an amazing dinner on a Monday night
Yes the restaurant was in full capacity, yet the service was excellent
We had the most amazing French white wine, and the food was really good
However the disserts were award winning! You must try the profiteroles ( DELICOUS) and the apple tatin
Ambience is great, very good looking people, even on a Monday night
Its great for birthdays as well, and for big groups (we were 10 and we had an amazing table)
I would definitely recommend it!
when we wandered through Broadway in SoHo on Saturday - it wasn't what I expected
Came back on sunday - loved it
So much calmer, saw more of the side streets and Balthazar was great
FABULOUS people watching, great food, not the ENORMOUS portions you usually get at brunches, to-die-for smoked bacon and the bakery products are divine
Loved it, but beware, the Oyster Mary really has three oysters in it
Our aloof, but efficient server just told me that oyster only meant it was made w/Clamato juice
Great food, MAKE RESERVATIONS enjoy
We came here before going to Pastis but it has us hooked, now we're going to try the whole bloody chain! Fabulous decor and food (my wife now wants a kitchen that models after the restaurant) and the bakery on the premise is just the icing on the cake
MAKE A RESERVATION!!
My girlfriend and I go to Balthazar a few times a month and each time seems better than the last
The food is great, but the atmosphere is equally pleasing
The ambiance glows with grand mirrors, the faded yellow walls, high ceilings, and subway floor tiling
Many little details make Balthazar stand out in front of the usual French Bistros(the playing cards stuck to the ceiling)
For two the price is pretty reasonable (about $130-135 tip included)
I always get the steak frites with a bowl of onion soup and the oyster sampler sometimes
For dessert I highly recommend the profiteroles
You might feel a little wedged-in at your table, but everyone is very friendly and the staff is very prompt in meeting your every need
Definitely my favorite restaurant in all of NYC
I've been to some nice places and Balthazar is the best by far
We have heard great things about Balthazar from many people
My wife and I were taking bdear friends out in NYC wanted to try
Called a month in advance and got a great table, no wait, for 8:00 Friday night
I felt like I was back in France
No snobbery or attitude, just great service and even better food
The Cod and the Duck Confit were to die for as well as the fresh oysters
Our waitstaff was very knowlegeable and made the experience seem very authentic
If you want real Brasserie cuisine in a fun atmosphere, you must call ahead and do Balthazar
Worth all the hype
Good dining experience but VERY loud
We had to yell to have a conversation
Not romantic
Nice decor
Our waiter, Walter, was fantastic but when he left for the night-service went out the window
No one came to ask us if we needed anything else and we had to find someone to ask for our bill
Reasonable priced-for New York that is!
Yes this is a crowded, noisy atmosphere
but that's exactly what the atmosphere is in Paris at a Bistro
The Pate appetizer was excellent as was the Trout
The waiter was very helpful with a wine recommendation
We were served our food quickly and efficiently by a team of organized wait staff
I would definitely return, though I do wonder how some reviewers on this site had such a different experience
Diner at Balthazar is about seeing and being seen
Beautiful and loud dining room makes you feel like you walked into movie, the kind where everyone is enjoying themselves
Definitely, an only in New York experience
Food is solid French fare with no surprises
Every dish is tried and true, so no disappointments
Wine service was poor however
When ordering Champagne, I asked if they had any Extra Dry, I was told that the Brut were very dry
Even the wine expert told me the same thing
Finally, when the Champagne did arrive, he overflowed my cup onto the table
However, the wait staff immediately responded, cleaned up our table
Wait staff is extremely friendly, which is impressive given that it was 2 am by the time we left and the place was still crowded
Glitzy, loud, and fun!!!
Not worth all the fuss
Dinner selections are uncreative
Good raw bar, though
Brunch was overpriced w/ cheap, poorly prepared food
DINERS serve better french toast than Balthazar
Balthazar is ALWAYS packed, loud and fun
It's a great place for drinks at the bar
I like their brunch better than their dinner
It's even mentioned in the TV show, Will and Grace, when Grace was so surprised at Karen for being able to get a reservation at THE Bathazar
I found it a great restaurant, even though on the expensive side, but better than some restaurants offering the same price for French food
It was a lively restaurant, with celebrity spottings on two of the days I went
I say
at least try it once
Lively ambience
Good service
Extensive wine list, though kind of pricey
Drinks expensive
Food was mediocre at best
The wine I ordered was awful
Admittedly, it was an inexpensive bottle but it should still be drinkable
Always have to wait on hold for reservations
Balthazar is the McDonald's for celebrities
They go there for good solid fare so if you're into gawking, this is the place
The fish dishes are terrific--especially the trout
If you get the steak, be warned that they don't under-cook it
So medium well is definitely medium well
Also be warned, this is not the place for intimate conversation
The place is loud--which is great if you're a large group
I OFTEN ORDER THE SAME DISHES WHEN I ANTICIPATE HAVING BRUNCH AT BALTHAZAR
THE LAST FEW TIMES, THE FOOD WAS NOT CONSISTENT
THE SALAD LOOKED DEAD ON THE PLATE AND ANOTHER TIME, THE CRUSTY PASTRY WITH EGGS WAS VERY DRY AND STALE
I WAS DISAPPOINTED SINCE I USED TO LOVE THESE FAVORITE ITEMS
My wife and I did the Sunday brunch thing here with friends to celebrate our anniversary

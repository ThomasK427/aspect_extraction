It will be an experience that's hard to top!
I had a weeknight reservation for 9 pm, and wasn't seated until close to 10
The service was uptight and poor -- they actually REFUSED to honor simple requests
It is baffling that any restaurant could survive in NYC with that kind of downright bad service
But, the cardinal sin of this place is that the sushi we were served was small, dry and extremely unfresh
We tried two or three pieces of sushi and sashimi and left the rest as inedible
I paid the check and escaped as quiclly as possible, never to return
Beware: this emperor has no clothes
Food was ok
Nothing special, infact quite disapponited by lack of creation
Too expensive for what it was
the menu for omakase was not written clearly
Just tell me what's really good about this restaurant?!?!? Service was poor
Our waiteress did not smile at all
Though others did
Went there with lots of expectation yet came out with anger
My Q is what was good? Not the food, not the service, so what then
Remember the 80's when you have to wait 1-2 hours for a table even though you have a reservation + the wait staff treated you like the idiot that you are for paying $2-300 per head for this treatment, then you should definately come to experience this jewel!! After waiting 1
5 hours for a table (with reservations) when I was told 15 minutes or so by the owner, waiting 1/2 hour between each appetizer (not course) my party was a bit edgy due to starvation
I can't really rate the food since I left after waiting 2 hours after being seated to be served 3 tiny appetitizers
The manager was unapologetic and distraught that we were had complained after 3 hours of waiting patiently

Jewel Bako needs to realize that times have changed, restaurants these days must have ambience,service and food to keep us coming back
Good Luck!!
bad attitude, too expensive and what's the hype?? place is absolutely booked before it even opens for dinner, absolutely empty and yet
they are fully booked
As is evidence in the rated lists on City Searcg: Jewel Bako who last year was high on the lists for both Sushi and Japanese food is now 9th on Sushi and did not even make the cut for Japanese
In Jersey we call that a Flash in the Pan
The Chef here cannot make anything more complicated than simple Sushi and often cuts it wrong, which he's famous for
The dishes are tiny, o the snobby owners can make more money on their high priced rip off
Check out Hobokens Sushi Lounge instead
It Rocks!
having lived in japan for 2 years, i have high standards for japanese food
jewel bako, which literally means jewel box, is true to its name
the decor is excellent and the maitre d' was extremely helpful and even put up with my japanese
for food, the mushroom appetizer is small but delicious, the omakase is a perfect sushi selection, and the sake selection was great
it's a bit pricey (good japanese always is), but i'd go back in a heartbeat
The food was good, but not great
very interesting and unique selection of seafood, but WAY overpriced
I dined there with 2 others, we ate a reasonable amount (by no way huge amount) of food and one bottle of sake, and the bill without tip was $300! On top of that, when we tried to order more food half-way through our first entree order, the waitress told us that we couldn't because they needed the table for another reservation! When you spend over $100/person, that's just not acceptable service
the service was *very* attentive, the food was fantastic, and it was well worth the (relatively large number of ) pennies thrown down
We all appreciate the beauty of this small East Village Japanese Restaurant, but when it comes down to taste, and treating customers with respect and courtesy, Jewel Bako fails times and time again!  I know many others who feel just as I do about the down right lousy service, but let's face it, there are a lot of poorly run restaurants in the Big Apple
Jewel Bakos biggest problem is the food
While it certainly looks nice and is presented well, but it's BLAND, FALLS APART BEFORE YOU CAN EAT IT, and is served so late you may forget what you've ordered!  Jewel Bako has a LONG way to go before it can be thought of as a decent NYC eatery, if only they would place as much attention to decor as to the food, and service, they'd REALLY have something to be proud of, instead of this TOURIST TRAP
The buzz on Jewel Bako is that it is great looking, but poor in staff, and lousy in food, and thats pretty much the truth
They could get better though
Try Sugiyama instead
The size lays the groundwork for a quaint and intimate experience
The owners are extremely friendly and knowledgable, and the sushi chefs are amongst the most skilled I have ever seen
Undoubtedly, make reservations, specifically for the bar if you're less than four people
The food is absolutely splendid, presented with character and unique style, and overall, it makes for an excellent indulgence
In a city packed with competition for Japanese Restaurants, there is really no need for the Jewl Bakos of the world
New Yorkers will not accept terrible service, snobby owners, low grade food, un-kept reservations, and doctored reviews
I have had some bad meals in my day, but the way we were treated here, takes the cake
Some may think the East Village and snotty service go hand in hand, but it's simply not true
Jewel Bako needs to re-think, and re-staff, and start by getting a good chef, and treating your customers with a little respect
The owner is very meticulous and tries very hard to serve each and every customer
We experienced this when our we arrived for our 7:30 reservation and our a table was not available for the next 45 minutes
We were offered two seats at the Sushi bar and were given complementary sake, appetizers, etc
While the sushi was not anything fancy, it was extremely fresh and tasteful
I was more impressed at the service and courteous staff than the food
Overall, I would recommend visiting this place at least once to try it for yourself!
The hospitality and warmth exhibited here is unsurpassed! Pure Sushi at its best! Finally I don't have to fly to LA for authentic Japanese delights!
My partner and I eat at either Sushisay or Haru depending on our tastes for either traditional or new wave sushi
We were told that Jewel Bako was the best place in the city, I think what he meant was that it's the best place on it's block
may be
The food is not anything special, but it does have some interesting varieties, mostly the onlt thing that makes Jewel Bako neat is the spunky restaurant design
The appetizers need a lot of work, and our main meal took close to an hour to arrive
If we hear that Jewel Bako makes major changes, then may be we'll return
May be
Try Next Door Nobu instead, they are similar to eachother, but Next Door Nobu is far, far superior in every way
Although the food was good, it was no better than tomoe or blue ribbon
not only did they run out of the appetizer special, but also the regular king crab and sea urchin rolls before 10 pm on a sat
night! We had to wait over 45 min between soup and sushi
this place is overrated and overpriced
I've been hearing mixed reviews from friends and wanted to check out this joint for myself
Small venue, greeted by the owners wife who takes your coat very graciously with a smile at the door
The service is excellent - quick, informative and very attentive
Started w/ the tuna tartare edamame
The edamame was bland and not very fresh, the tuna tartare was deelish - miniscule serving
All the servings were very small portions
I had the $50 chef's sashimi selection
The sushi was fresh, nothing inventive, just straight on sushi
I had lychee sorbet, which was creamy and smooth
I drank green tea throughout the meal and my bill was $85 tax tip
Go to Sushi of Gari for a more fantastically innovative chef special and it will cost you less and leave you wanting more without making you feel like you need to eat more
Reading the reviews here, I was hesitant but decided to see for myself what JB was about
I'm glad I did
I took my boyfriend for his birthday here and we had a wonderful time and dinner
I had forgotten to confirm my reservation, but when I called, they were pleasant and had still held onto it for me
The sashimi was fresh and excellent, and I loved that I could try different variations of the same fish
The owners were quite eager to please and the staff let us enjoy our meal at our own pace, never rushing us
Everything here is done with care in this small space, from the service to food to decor to beverages (the house sake, usually a bust in other places, was terrific)
Definitely go see for yourself how JB makes it all work
An excellent choice for simply prepared, beautifully fresh sushi
Great for unusual varieties of fish
The service improves dramatically when you are a regular
The staff definitely recognize their repeat customers very personalized service)
One note on some other reviews: There seems to be a group of reviewers torching this place on a regular basis that are actually the same person (look for repeat language and common mispellings, like the owner is a clown)

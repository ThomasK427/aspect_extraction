It was huge, and it was delicious
Although the server had forgotten our drinks on one or two occasions, she was quick to bring in our food order
The whole staff was gracious and accommodating to our large group
The server even went to find out what the name of the restaurant meant!
The pizza there is tasty
The atmosphere is that of a good old time fun place
I wish the service had been more on top
Ended up here for our birthday dinner, after deciding to try somewhere new
I had read the reviews on city search and thought it might be worth a try
disappointment
The hostess was very nice, but they seated us way in the back, next to a drunk couple, with bad music playing rather loudly
The server looked disheveled and was not clear about the specials
When we ordered a wine off the special list, he brought us the wrong wine
When we told him it was the wrong one, he didn't recognize the wine I wanted, until I held out the list and showed him
The food took a while to come out and was mediocre at best
Not worth it, there are so many great italian food places don't waste your time or money
While the food was excellent, the ambience is superb, the servers were a bit tacky
I was with some friends from out of town, who had never been to the States before
I wanted to take care of the bill without them being aware of the cost
They were still drinking and I was not sure if we were going to be leaving, so I paid and then was going to leave any additional cost and the tip at the end, on our way out
Well, that was in thier thought process and proceeded to announce to our table that gratuity was not included
Needless to say I walked over to them and voiced my opinion and made them aware that although I was going to receommend it - that would not be happening
I am completely disgusted by the tacky watiress who did not even serve us
Disgusting!
I heard nothing but good things about Three of Cups and was excited to celebrate my birthday there
However upon arrival with my party of 10 we were quite dissapointed with the lack of servers and suprised with the large amount of bus boys that couldnt help
The food was average, service was lacking, overall it was nothing special
The tables around us that were smaller parties were served rather quickly, so while they label this good for groups you may be better off in a smaller party eating here
This is a locals place
It's got a nice little bar area in front so you can grab a drink and watch the peeps walk by
I didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food
The decor is nice and old school feeling
They don't have many beers on tap and those are all imports which was a bonus
Some couchs in front where you can chill with someone or a couple of friends
Laid back east village place
I love the atmosphere in this place
The restaurant has a classy atmosphere with dim lighting and large booths where you can sit comfortably with 4-6 people
The portion sizes are generous -- I ordered the Spaghetti Puttanesca and could barely finish it
My friends ordered individual pizzas and raved about them
I ordered a glass of sanagria for $7
It seemed a bit pricey at first, but then it arrived in this tall beer glass
I highly recommend this place for dates/group dinner/anything!
Highly recommend this place for quiet night out and small parties
Service was excellent and great looking staff
Food was amzing and just the right amount seasoning
Suggest to order a plate of Calamari
Thank you Three of Cups!
Everytime I'm in the East Village, without fail, I go to Three of Cups
The bartenders are sexy and cool, the atmosphere is rich and lush, and the food is authentic and extremely affordable
There's always great music playing, and although the bar area is a little too small (only because i like hanging out at the bar), the dining area is fantastic with outdoor seating
The summertime homemade Sangria knocks you off your feet, and the wait staff are East Village cool
Also, you can go downstairs to the lounge, where all sorts of delicious debauchery is created
I love this place; I take all out-of-town and in-town guests here
I highly recommend it
Highly
Three of Cups is an East Village classic
Its been around for years and has outlasted all the local competition and for good reason
Its like coming home to Momma
The pasta dishes are hearty with great no-nonsense Sicilian sauces
The Focaccia bread and olive oil served free with the meal is in my mind the best bread in the city
Its baked on premise
The pizza cooked in the wood burning stove is a delicacy, second only to maybe Lombardis in Little Italy
My girlfriend had an Arugala salad with shaved Parmisian cheese that she loved
The dark wooded atmosphere and candle lighting is romantic for sure and the service as always was friendly, but not intrusive
When you want a break from all the foo-foo high priced dining in this town, Three of Cups is the place to go
I lived a block from this place for a year and a half, benefiting from their nightly happy hour, where you can get great glasses of wine and tap beer for $3
The margarita pizza is some of the best in town - crisp, light, and goes great with that cheap drink! Awesome sunday brunch, too!
Three of Cups has some of the best Italian fod I've eaten outside Italy
Everyting is super fresh and homemade
Go for the homebaked rosemary bread that they serve right out of the brick oven and the fantastic homemade ravioli
i was at three of cups with a party of 8 for a birthday recently and was very unimpressed with the service
the staff was extremely slow (it took 30 minutes for them to take our order and over an hour to get our food
) we tried to make the best of it by ordering bottles of wine, but the food was very salty and bland
THEN, not three minutes after paying the bill, the manager comes and asks us to leave! we hadn't even finished our last bottle of wine! very rude
and the manager even tried to tell us that they didn't take reservations (which they do!) so we were clogging up a table
maybe if their staff wasn't so slow we wouldn't have been stayed as long
i'll never go there again
I recently went to The Three of Cups with a large group of my friends, 10 of us, for a birthday party
It was really fun
The food was really great, large portions and not pricey
We had great appetizers, which were all shareable (mussels, calamari and a great spinach salad), my spaghetti with white clam sauce was yummy and huge (much better than Ive had in Little Italy), great pizza too! The service was good
The atmosphere was comfortable, the whole place is lit by candles, even the bar area felt cozy, which had a great happy hour even on a Saturday night
Im definitely going back with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner that wont break the bank(they have agreat wine list) and Im going to check out their brunch
It was a very enjoyable experience
Highly recommended
This restaurant does not deserve it's high rating at all! The food is okay, but the service is TERRIBLE
Also, the music is extra loud so if you like quiet dining, don't even think about going to eat at this restaurant
I will NEVER eat there again!
Three of Cups is another one of my must try restaurants! The food is fabulous
You have to try their pasta dishes
It is wonderful
The crowd is pleasing
The atmosphere is relaxing
overall experience was great
Happens to be one of my favorite restaurants
so I suggest everyone should give it a try
It doesn't hurt to try! =)
I hosted a small party in the back room and everything turned out great
The service was excellent and the entire staff was so accommadating and friendly
The food is so tasty and the pizza out of this world

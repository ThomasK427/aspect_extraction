I gave this place another shot
I felt like I was in an OTB
The food was overpriced and average
What a dump
Real shame
I can only hope they go out of business and become something else (please!)
I used to come to Austin's a few years ago on a regular basis, and stopped due to relocating
I went there last night, and it was the same as it was a few years ago
- GOOD
Things must have been bad on the night the other reviewer was there, but the ambience and food were satisfactory to me
The food was served quickly, and there were buy-backs at the bar
Parking is bad, but its worth the walk
What used to be a great local place to meet and have a good meal, has now become another cookie cutter, cheap looking dive
The owners renovated and removed the charm of the place
It seems that the quality of food has gone down too, as a cost cutting measure
I've been twice since the changes were made, but I think I'm done wasting my time
As you are seated the server will light a candle to give you a nice candlelit experience
You'll enjoy the food served at this unique dining location
I recomend that everyone start with the maryland crabcakes
Enjoy a nicely prepared salad and indulge in one of the many imported beers on their list
If you've never had a belgian beer before, you must try it at Austin's Ale House
They've recently renovated the dining area
It is separate from the bar now
They waitstaff has been upgraded, the decor is very family oriented
The prices are decent for this type of food and dining experience
I've lived in New York for 11 years now and have yet to find a slice better then the one I get at Dani's
First, the the sauce is amazing(sweet and tangy)
Second, the crust is perfect-thin and crisp
Third, the cheese is good
What else could you ask for? How about it's cheap and open late! Plus, the wednesday deal is better then anything Gray's Papaya has
Hungry, broke, or drunk or all of the above
you must check this place out
I've not had a better slice in New York
And the price is always below market
I love sitting on a stool at the old-fashioned counter and paying after I eat
Also, they are open very late - and are right next to the railroad stop
The reviewer who said that No one I know who lives in Kew Gardens likes this pizza, is wrong
Or he doesn't know anybody
I don't know a soul in this neighbrohood (or outside) who does NOT like the pizza there
What makes this place great is that it is open till about 3am
making it one of the best late nite spots to grab a slice
The place is at its best when the old guy (Dani) is there doing quality controll and playing cards
At Dani you will find a pizza with a thin crust and a tangy tomato sauce
In addition to Pizza, Dani has great homemade Ravioli and Maniccoti
Just do not try to eat a slice in the dining room, Dani does not like that
The finest NY slice in the city
I lived all over the city, but grew up around the corner from Dani's
I've searched high low, near and far, but Dani's remains the benchmark for the best pizza in the boroughs
On Wednesdays I will call 1 hour ahead and order 1 large pizza
That gives me 8 slices for only 7 dollars
You must think that the quality is poor for them to sell it for such a low price
You must think that they have to compete with other pizzerias
I know only that I love their pizza
Their sauce hints of a touch of too much sweetness but tied with the rest of the pizza, the tastes even out and you get a pizza your mouth will water over
For strictly pizza lovers, you can fight for a stool by the entrance or stand cramped by the door
If you're interested in having a sit-down dinner
Do not miss the wonderful Veal dishes
Just walking past this establishment during dinner hours will make you dream of garlic empowered sauce covering a tender veal cutlet
Buon Appetito!
Great pizza, cheap, and fast
especially wednesdays when pizza is a dollar a slice
I even take it to friends in florida who request it
Dani's Pizza has got everyone HOOKED over here
Everyone that tries just ONE slice of the pizza is automatically converted into a believer
*I can personally attest to that* I was so amazed at its amazing taste that I asked the cook behind the counter one day
WHY IS THIS SO POPULAR AND GOOD? He said the secret was in the SAUCE, which is TOP NOTCH
Simply unbeatable~ Dani's is also the best bang for your buck because on Wednesday's, they have a slice for 0
99 cents! (Large pie for 7 bucks!) And these slices are REALLY large
Dani's Pizza is amazing, hands down
If you don't believe me, go try it for yourself and prepare to be amazed
Whatever you though you knew about good pizza means nothing until you try a slice at Dani's
The sauce is somewhat sweet but thats how we like, and the crust is allways crispy but bewhare, a slice to go ussually ends up being too hot for consuption lest you burn your mouth
Who can beat dollar slice wed
though? Get in beat the afternoon lunch crowds, or stop by on the late night at 3:30 when they are still serving up the most money pizza in the city
There is even a great selection of beer
You can only sit on the stools with a slice, as the main dining area downstairs is for real food
The staff is cool and friendly, and the place has been around since J
C
so you know they do it right
Check it out and you may never wanna leave KEw G
~ari
Everytime I come to New York
I have to head to Dani's
Whether or not I get a slice or not
I crave their sauce
I highly recommend the Veal Parmingana
If your looking for real food, this is the place to eat
They even allow you to take your time to dine at your own pace
This place is magnificent! The staff is very friendly, and the food is great
It's nicely decorated, and is definately an ideal place for those bottomless Pit eaters out there
We waited in line for 1 hour and ended up leaving (there was only 20 - 30 people in front of us)because there were only letting in small groups of 10 in at a time every 45 mins
By the time we left, there must have been a line of 100 people
It would take the 100th person 5 hours to get in at the rate they were letting people in
The only reason the line move was because people left the line
Small place - but the best pizza around
Try it you wont be sorry
I have been going to Salerno's since I was born practically
My family always goes when we get together in NY
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is quite lovely
The owner is very sweet and accommadating

ranging from high-end Santa Fe to the still fresh mex in Albuquerque's south valley
After years of bad luck (i
e
Mary Ann's and Tortilla Flats???) I found Dos Caminos
No, they don't have green chile, sopapillas and chile rellenos
But their excellent guac, prickly pear marg, and adequate mole sauce gets me though some of my cravings
Staff and patrons are typical NYC model/actress/waiter, but take a shot of tequila from their decent list and you'll be enjoying your co
in no time
The food was so so for the price
We had a very nice lobster and shrimp appetizer
It went down hill from there, with fresh fish, and main dishes clearly sitting under a heat lamp for too long
After dinner we went to the bar, and were subjected to probably the rudest bartender I have ever encountered
This was highly embarrasing for me, as I had brought out of town guests to dine at what a I am told is a outstanding restaurant
i went here during restaurant week to take advantage of the great prix fixe menu
in addition to the selections on the prix fixe menu, our group also tried the guacamole
everything was very good, including the service and decor/atmosphere
i wouldn't come here often with the normally high prices, but for 30
04/person for 3 courses, it's definitely worth it
This place is impossible to penetrate during dinnertime, so go during lunch, like I did
Prices are near-reasonable for the lunch menu
The guacamole is out of this world, you are obliged to try some (anyone who tells you different is full of it)
I had a pretty simple chicken sandwich with lots of tasty add-ons and potato crisps
No drinks but the tequila selection seemed very impressive
The decor is on the money, with proper mood lighting and comfortable couch seating
Service was professional, if overly perky for my taste
OK I admit that am trying Dos Caminos way after its 15 minutes of fame a couple of years ago, but what was that hoopla all about!? On Wednesday evening the place was packed with your basic PAS yuppies, the din was awful, the hostess was cold
Yes, the guac is the best I've had, but the rest of the food was mediocre to plain bad: cold meatballs in our chowder, ceviche with way too much hot pepper to taste anything else, basically revolting meatballs with bland tomato sauce on mushy corn thingies, etc
And yes, the traditional margarita was potent, but overwhelmingly sweet
Rosa Mexicana is still the top high-end Mexican in NYC, as far as I know
Having never really been a fan of mexican cuisine, I was rather disapointed to find my wife and I were eating at Dos Caminos
Mexican Kitchen
OOPS! It was by far one of the best meals that I have had in recent history
The Guac, which was made tableside to your own tasting, was nothing short of Brilliant
Bursting with a diverse range of flavors to tickle anyones taste buds
Of course I started to get a little margharita happy
I have only had one Margharita that was better than the ones I had there
The Melrita @ SAGA
All the Ceviches were fantastic, to say the least
The Big Eye Tuna was perfect
On to the dessert special Grapefruit/Margharita raspado
Cool and refreshing
I am now and forever a converted Mexican food fan
If there is a better word for perfection insert it here ______
We started with the guacamole and this is by far the best I've ever had bar none
I then had the big eye tuna ceviche in a costeno chile salsa and my girlfriend's dish was salmon in a spicy pumpkin seed mole and it was absolutely scrumptious
We sampled a few varieties of tequila and the one that stood out was described as tasting like vanilla ice cream and I would have to agree
The bouquet and finish were that of vanilla with a buttery smooth texture
The margarita's were excellent and with the variety of tequila's available can be easily tailored to your liking
Dos Caminos is not your typical burrito and bean Mexican fare and those looking for such should probably look elsewhere
However if you want Mexican with a twist and don't mind paying a little more then I suggest you give this restaurant a try
I visited Dos Caminos on a Monday night and had a great dining experience
We ate outside and partook in people watching as the location lends itself to it
The tequila selection is very extensive and the margaritas were tasty
I recommend the guacamole starter with some jalapeno pepper on the side
We ordered a selection of appetizers rather than getting one entree each which allowed for a varying selection of tastes
All the food was delicious
Desserts were also good
The layout of the restaurant was excellent, especially with the outside seating
I would imagine it would be tight in the cold weather as there is quite a bit of seating outdoors
It can be pricey but try ordering an appetizer selection if youre looking to save a few bucks
Enjoy
It seems Dos Caminos has a mixed reputation, but for me it was excellent
I had the Camarones Al Ajillo (sauteed Gulf Shrimp with toasted garlic and Guajillo Chile, saffron rice toasted almonds) and it was spectacular
I can honestly say I have not had a dish like this, and the sauce was imaginitive, exquisite and well worth it
The service was good, and decor great and
the best guacamole is the simplest; and thats exactly the way Dos Caminos prepared it
Having been a native Californian for several years, I have had A LOT of excellent Mexican food
Yet I have not been able to find a mexican restaurant in New York that can compare to anything in California
With that said, I can't imagine where Dos Caminos got their inspiration from
The food is marginal at best, lacking all flavor and taste
The guacamole is a total joke!!!!! My 2 guests and I ordered the large guacamole (which is very small in comparison) and were left hungry and anxiously awaiting our main course
The only thing I can say that was good about the experience were the drinks - be sure to order the drinks a little extra strong though
Mexican cuisine it is NOT!!!!!
the best thing to say about dos caminos is the table made guacamole
even though they have a great selections of tequila, the drinks they offer on the menu are fare to bad
we tried three different drinks each and didnt come up with one good one
soho has a great cafe, but takes a while to get a seat
not worth the trip
I've been here many times (drinks and meals) b/c I work nearby
The decor is absolutely beautiful
The service is good ANYWHERE but in the back corner by the kitchen where they have this one waiter who is just a JOKE (and he's been there for monthsmonths!!)
A meal with him takes 3 hours
He messes up orders
He says I think this gingerale is flat but taste it and then disappears for 20 min
(It was
) The food is ok but it never impresses me
The guac
is the only thing worth going for -- made fresh at your table
Huge tequila selection too if you're a connaisseur, so great margaritas
But don't go out of your way for this place -- food is only ok
Too much hype for this restaurant
As a Mexican, I was disappointed with the food
While the food was not bad, it was not as extraordinary as it should be for all the hype I had heard about the restaurant
The guacamole was not bad, but I've had better
The mole tasted as if it had come from the ones I buy in the supermarket
I might try it's other location, but will be hard pressed to return altogether
Food was not very flavorful, portions were extremely small
We paid $11 for a tiny portion of guacamole (enough for 1 person at best), with some pre-packaged tortilla chips
The selection of tequila is excellent, but other than that there are much better places in NYC to go for mexican food that also have a trendy scene
NO! This place didn't do it for me, nor my date

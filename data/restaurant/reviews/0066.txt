this is the ONLY place to go for the best tomato mozarella panino in the city
friendly staff, great cappuccinos, and a soothing atmosphere that makes you want to stay all day
Great food
Great salads
Great sandwiches
High quality food that is not too expensive
In Short  Innumerable depictions of the Dalai Lama watch over youthful vegetarians and their health-conscious brethren in this dimly lit two-room space
The menu, which combines pan-Asian influences, offers a wide range of stir-fries and noodle dishes, with several varieties of momo (Tibetan dumplings) as highlights
The restaurant's namesake, a barley soup, is best saved for die-hard authenticity seekers
Recently went there for dinner with my wife
The ambience was better than I expected but it stopped there
Within 3 minutes after we sat the waiter was hovering over us to get our food order
In addition to the weak service, the food which we had high expectations for was bland and probably cooked/undercooked a few hours in advance
Good vegetables, dumplings, fresh juices
So pretty and mellow and romantic
Fast service, friendly staff, clean bathroom
When I visited Tsampa years ago I didn't understand why many dishes tasted bland
Instead of writing a negative review, I let it be thinking who am I to judge Tibetan tastes in food
It wasn't until I returned from Tibet recently that I realized why Tibetan cuisine can be bland
The reason is that when you are living at high altitudes--especially 4000 meters and up--you just don't want heavily spiced foods in your stomach
At high altitudes one has less of an appetite quite possibly because it is more difficult to properly digest foods
For this reason the Tibetans have traded horses with the Chinese for centuries in exchange for tea, which aids proper digestion
So, next time you wonder about the blandness of certain Tibetan cuisine, remember that when you live at 5000 meters above sea level, Tibetan cuisine will be the only thing that you are craving!
Went with a friend for dinner
Started with the chicken dumplings (momo), which were rather bland: now I know why they serve a hot sauce with them
We also had the specialty appetizer, these small stuffed balls, which were wonderful! I had the Sherpa chicken dish, which was a new experience for my pallet: the spices, potatoes, chicken, and bread all worked wonderfully together
The ambiance was very relaxing, and the staff was very helpful (although it took a while to get the check)
For a new take on Asian food, enjoy a night this gem
Had a late-night dinner there on Friday, and while the decor is fabulous, we waited a long time for our check
Refills were also scarse
However, I'd definitely go back! The food was good, and it's a great intimate setting for a date
My boyfriend and I went for dinner, and we were impressed
We order iced chai, yogurt drink, amdo momo, baked noodles, and eggplants
The drinks were very good, and momo ok, but wasn't as well spiced and delicious as the entrees (just go for entree-sized momos)
Tsampa really shined for the entrees though
The sauces were amazing, with depth, flavor, warmth, and complemented the food perfectly
I especially loved the noodles, as it's chewy and different from everything else I've eaten
The serving size is hearty, with quite a vegetarian selection as well
The food was a great value at $10 for entree and $5 for appetizer (ignore the $$$)
The decoration was perfect for a date, very romantic and quiet, and the waitstaff polite
I didn't experience waiting time as we went on a weekday
I highly recommend this to anyone
I'd rate this 9
5
Tsampa has very wholesome healthy food thats is absolutely delicious
They use free range chicken, organic vegetables, and the paycheck was rather low compared to other organic places I've tried
I loved the baked noodles and the sherpa khala (potatoes and chicken served with delicious bread!) Do order the chai- its gingery, milky and warm
Their dumplings have a LOT of chicken in them
Delivery wasn't the fastest, but the food was still hot so I won't complain
Service in the restaurant is also prompt and kind
Highly recommended for the organic eater
Very delicious! The Chicken w/ greens is my favorite entree
but you MUST start the meal with a variety of Momos the Scallion Pancakes! An affordable wine list
Calming and delicious!
i try to go here at least 3 or 4 times a month and try to take non-new yorkers as well
when you step into the restuarant you feel automatically calm and read to eat! I always get the shrimp dishes
the sauses they use are really on point
dont get mixed drinks here, they are very watered down
just get wine if you wanna drink something and then head to SOLAS down the street for some drinks
you need to go here at least once
Tsampa is a really excellent eating experience
Food is very good, mostly organic
The family-like staff makes all effort to make you feel comfortable and settled, so the meal can be enjoyed fully
all of our meals were so good
everyone was happy
we were full at the end and it was less than $25 a person
the wait gets long, but it's worth it
the only thing-the menu says the food is all natural, and i still don't know what that means exactly
whatever-it was good
I am from the Hills of Nepal, and I am a dumpling connoisseur, in fact that makes up 95% of my diet
(This explains my plump stature) Anyways, the food here is very bland
The dumplings were crudely made and were just on par with the ones found in the frozen section of the supermarket
The chicken curry I tried was also not tasty, nor was the actual food amount enough
The worst part was that they charged an extra dollar for the bowl of rice
It was an average experience, but I was very disappointed
Tsampa is not your usual Tibetan fare of heavy meats and dumplings
Rather, these beautiful Tibetan ladies have made hearty Tibetan food delicate with a Japanese-inspired flair
The momos (dumplings) are tiny with paper-thin dough, the shitake pancakes are to die for, the steamed greens (I forgot the name of the dish) is delicious as a vegetarian entry or with sauteed salmon
Meanwhile they usual have Tibetan flute or melodic chanting soothing your soul as you dine
TRY IT!
I love going to Tsampa because you feel like you've left the city once you've entered this restaurant
The lighting is nice and dim, the set up is very peacful, the staff is sooo sweet and attentive, and the food is really really good
Definitely go here if you want a memorable one-on-one evening with someone you feel close to
The food at Tsampa is delicious!! I'd never had  Tibetan before, but wanted to try it! My friends and I all loved it! Delicious momos (dumplings) and a cold salad for appetizers and noodle dishes with chicken and vegetables for the main course
All were tasty and well prepared
Great teas too! Pleasant staff
We did not have a wait, and there was enough space so your neighbor wasn't right on you
A nice space to enjoy a good dinner, and good conversation with friends
I'd definitely go again!
In Short The bi-level dining room, which resembles a bamboo-thatched hut, is a brightly-lit, wide-open space with high ceilings and laminated depictions of Indian village life
Cast your shoes aside and sink into a cushioned booth in an enclosed hut, surrounded by artificial banyan trees and wisteria
The prix fixe meal typically includes spicy chickpeas flecked with tomato and coriander, samosas stuffed with ground vegetables and peas, khichdi (a lentil and rice mixture) and chilled mango soup
The first time I tried to eat here I was gruffly turned away because I did not have a reservation
Not to be deterred I made one two nights later for their only open seating at 10:15
Despite the late hour my girlfriend and I had an amazing time
The atmosphere was a little 'campy' but very enjoyable
The food was fantastic, and the 'all-you-can-eat' prix fixe offers a great variety of tastes and textures
I'm a pretty big eater and I couldn't make it for round 2 in this place since I was stuffed after the apps and main course
Our waitress did a good job explaining all the dishes and we did not feel overly rushed to leave (which we did around 11:45)
Overall I was happy with my experience and look forward to going back

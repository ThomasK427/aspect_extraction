In the best/worst tradition of Hollywood sequels, it failed to meet every expectation
It was appalling in every way; we were seated hap-hazzardly by a buss-boy who'd been promoted for the evening
The wine took 20 minutes to arrive, the appetizer a further 30
An hour into the evening we were informed that the main courses were unavailable and insult was added to injury when a steak ordered rare arrived well-done
Worst of all was management's arrogant and dismissive stance in the face of such ineptitude
As with movies, some of the greats should remain one-offs
This was the worst experience ever in New York City!! We had to wait 30 minutes before the waiter even came to our table and had to ask 4 times just to get a glass of water
All of the tables in our row ended up sharing salt, pepper, and ketchup because the service was so terrible
We even skipped out on the dessert of our prix fix menu because we just wanted to get out of there!!! The staff was rude as well
I agree with a lot of the previous reviews
I ate at Les Halles downtown Tuesday night b/c it was the only place open in that neighborhood
but the service was very very slow, the waiters were nice but not very informative, and the hanger steak was okay at best
The layout is nice and the mood is fun, but the food was not worth the hefty price tag
I do recommend the house red wine--excellent!
Don't even bother
The uptown location manages to provide you with a decent meal
somehow the downtown location is a complete mess
Too many other options available in thhis city to go there
I've been twice
but never again
This is the kind of food you eat in brasseries in France
Good quality and authenticity
Nice staff, nice decoration
We're big fans of the Park Avenue South Les Halles and were very disappointed by the poor service and atmosphere of the downtown branch - would never go here again
Thank heavens for Les Halles
The Financial District is pretty dead on evenings, especially weekends
The place is always open and serves excellent food late into the night
The atmosphere is that of a French neighborhood bistrot
The steak frites is genuinely like you'd get in Paris and the wine list allows you to choose what best goes with it
My favorite place to hang out on a Sunday evening
I've heard how great the uptown one is, but there's seems to be nothing but negatives about the service in the downtown one
My three visits have included at least one (if not all three) of the following: forgetful/confused service, smart-assed service (and it's not cooler because your french), slow service, and uneven qualty in food
Yeah, the steak frites are good, but this is NYC, and at these prices, all components should be great
Seems that Bourdain's attempts at celebrity have made him forget what he's good at-- running a restaurant
we went during downtown dinner week which may be why we experienced terrible customer service, but that is no excuse! we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation, an the hostess actually had the nerve to say we could leave if we didn't like the wait
this restaurant, its customer service and food brings shame to les halles uptown
Although the food was good, it would have been nice to eat it within a half decent time period
Once the waiter took our orders, the appies came, the drinks came, and then we waited, the table next to us, that was seated after us were already eating their main course, the waiter then asked if we wanted to see a desert menu, I said it would be nice to have our meals first, there was no sorries, etc
, etc
, heh, who needs Paris when it's in your backdoor?
When a bar makes the wrong drinks thats fine
But when the bartender messes up the returned drinks something is wrong
It gets worse when the waiter storms off in a huff
When he did (finally) come back and was asked about a wine suggestion the answer was I don't know what you like
Food was quite good but doesn't make up for the fact that the manager (on his own) saw a problem and felt he had to get involved
Bad service is one thing
but
There are so few wonderful places like this dowtown
Most places close early but this place stays open late
I've never had such a tasty bisque in my life and the duck shepards pie is enormous and delicious! Everything is priced so well! I come back as often as I can
The staff deals with customers very well
Last time we were there a guy got really upset because he wanted a Corona and not any fancy french sh**
They WHY did he go to a french place?? I was so embarrassed that a New Yorker would act that way
The manager very politely told the drunk man that he could leave and then gave everyone on the resturaunt a free glass of port for having to witness it
So sweet! We are treated so well every time we go there
WHAT HAPPENED? Togi used to be great, with calm, nice service
It must be under new mgt
On 12/23/04 I had the worst restaurant experience ever
I ordered japchae w/beef, and the server brought it w/chicken, then insisted I had ordered it with chicken and refused to correct the order
He said I had to pay for it, and I asked for the check
He made rude, insulting comments while giving me my change
He clearly needs to get out of the restaurant business
Also, small portions, no garnishes, bad value all around
The food and prices are great but the service while fair, could be better
I have been to this place many times now and I keep coming back for some great Korean fare
The Sushi is nice too
Togi has really great food, and a really cute and cozy atmosphere
They made a small space in Chelsea into a great Korean restaurant
I really like there uncluttered decor and the food is clean, unique to their own Togi taste, and still very authentic, great quality Korean food
I always look forward to going to Togi
This place is great
The Korean soups are fantastic
Prices are reasonable, atmosphere and service is good too
I absolutely love TOGI
I am lucky enough to have it in my neighborhood
I order or dine in at least 2-3 times a week
The spicy crunchy rolls are AMAZING! And
they have a special happy hour when you dine in during the week
I'm in love with Togi
At first, I fell for the fire roll
I was completely faithful until I tried the dragon roll and now I'm a dragon-roll-convert
Everything is great at Togi - staff, food, value
The hot tea is lovely, too!
Nice place, nice staff, decent food, nice vibe
Quaint and quiet
If you're in the nieghborhood for Sushi, forget Monster (and the monster crowd), go to Togi
If you don't feel like trekking to 32nd for Korean, go to Togi
I absolutely love this place
The service is great
I felt the staff was really in tune with what I wanted
The Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap was to die for
The secret red sauce was delicious
i would highly recommend to anyone wanting delicious food at low prices
Ever so friendly staff serves some excellent Korean cuisine
Try the tofu bibimbap (mixed rice), and you are sure to visit again
Lunchboxes are fabulous for anyone of them can satisfy your appetite
Evn if you are a health nut, or a vegetarian, you will find something you will enjoy
You don't know what you are missing!
The Scene Sophisticated dining isn't what Times Square is known for, but this cavernous, beautifully designed restaurant, which occupies two floors of the W Hotel, is just that
A school of Brancusi-like minnows overhead and a huge glass facade that overlooks Broadway's TKTS booth keep the eye entertained

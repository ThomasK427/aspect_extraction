but the fish
soft, tender, fresh and always a delight
I don't know why someone wrote a review about the bad service, everytime I go to Acqua the staff is SUPER friendly
The food is good and the price is right
Hey maybe I should write a bad reivew to keep this our neighborhood secret! Folks if you get a chance try this place, it's really good
Very disappointed during my last visit
My friend (whose sister is a chef) I were treated terribly
The hostess told us a table would be ready in 2 minutes but, soon after, manager/owner(?) told us the wait was 10 minutes
There were many tables available
We were told to wait at a table for 3 but were not offered the table
After waiting 10 minutes, a couple walked in who were seated immediately (at a table for 4!!) by the manager as we sat right in front of him
Since I listened closely, I know they were a party of 2 without any reservation The manager then offered to seat us but we left
B/c of word limit, I cannot share additional details
Note to Manager: If this continues, you will have no customers
Customers: Do not stand for poor treatment
There are far better places
as far as i am concerned this is by far the best italian for the price on the upper west side
I have travelled extensively in italy,so i was very pleasantly surprised to find a place like acqua with delicious consistent homemade food
My italian friends all love it ,complimenti !
I posted the review last year in which I sang the praises of this neighborhood restaurant
Unfortunately, the quality has deteriorated in every way since I wrote it
The menu has been changed to a mostly unhealthy one, adding bacon even to the fish dishes (sometimes with no notice), so if youre looking for vegetarian or even just healthy seafood dishes, you wont find much
The last time I went to the restaurant, the waitress made me wait to take my order, then left me without anything to drink throughout the entire meal
She did not come over once during my meal to inquire if I needed anything
I hope they soon revert to their former terrific food and wonderful service
We love this place! It is the best value in the area; the food is consistently delicious, the atmosphere is fantastic and were always treated well
When Acqua opened we were hoping it was going to be good and we haven't been disappointed yet
A very well kept secret on the upper west side
I just had to give a shout out to my favorite sushi delivery place in the area
Not only does Miyako have the best specialty rolls that I can find (I love the ones wrapped in just cucumber!) but with every delivery they include a little tasty something extra for free! (and sometimes more than one thing
) How can anyone pass that up? Everything they offer from salads, dumplings, sashimi, and rolls that I have tried is consistently good and the service is very prompt
I have never eaten there, but I would highly recommend them anytime for delivery!
Granted, this place has great sweet treats: pecan pie, fruit tarts, and marble cheescake can't be beat
And reasonable prices! BUT you'd get better service on an airplane


in coach
Agonizingly slow, even when it's only half-full
Takeout orders are the worst
Whoever is behind the counter seems to think their job for the day is to mingle with the other employees rather than serve the customers
You can usually expect a 5-10 minute wait for a coffee order, and 10-15 minutes for a cup of soup to go, even when you are the only customer there! My last visit was an all-time low: 15 minute wait for soup, which luckily I took back home, as the disinterested counterperson included a plastic knife and fork


but no spoon
How can it possibly take 15 minutes to reheat and serve a cup of soup?! Ugh
Service is absolutely awful! Eat before you go
you'll be waiting awhile
This is a great coffeeshop in the quickly becoming fashionable area of Lenox Avenue in Harlem
The interior is warm and inviting, the service is great
You must try the cheesecake with FRESH strawberries on top
I'm don't even usually like cheesecake that much, but they make it great at Settepani
This is a great place to stop and relax in Harlem
Poor, poor service
After requesting to move seats (so that I wouldn't be seated next to the window
it was a freezing that day), I was denied even though there were empty seats in the restaurant
My friend and I waited FOREVER for our food
During that time, the waiter did not come over to say anything to us
Other patrons that sat after us receive their food
The trio next to us ended up leaving because they waited too long for someone to even bring over some water
Prior to this, another experience
we had reservations for a party of 15
When we got there, we were told that no one made reservations!!!
We came here with a group of friends on a Wednesday night and LOVED it
The place was pretty much empty so we had a nice corner spot to ourselves
Service was fine, but then again, there weren't that many customers
We liked the Moroccan decor of mosaic walls, hanging lamps and indoor fountain
The food was definitely the highlight though
We had the lamb tagine with prunes, roasted chicken with saffron, and filo pie with chicken and almonds
They were all mouthwateringly delicious
Capped the meal with pastries and moroccan tea
From the other reviews, I'd say not to go on a weekend
If you live on UES, check it out on a weekday!
I don't know what all the complaints were about - we LOVE this place
It is one of our stand-by restaurants
We've been making our own couscous for years, and this is the first place that we've gone where their couscous rivals ours
The service is a little slow - but it's no slower than a typical European restaurant - and it gives you more time to enjoy the company of your dining companions
We stay away on weekends because we have no desire to see belly-dancers and we don't like to fight typical week-end crowds
This was the worst dining experience I have ever had
The food was bland, the service was painfully slow
We were encouraged to order the more expensive Sultan meals--$39 for appetizer, entree, dessert, and coffee/tea
The food was horrible, and full of small bones, the dessert was advertised as homemade ice cream and pastries--but we only received 2 small scoops of commercial ice cream--no pastries
We were not given coffee or tea
The belly dancing show was supposed to last for 90 minutes, but instead was 45 mins, and consisted mostly of a small girl (probably under 10 yrs old)
We spent a very painful FOUR hours at this place
In the end, the manager tried to add on extra charges--above and beyond the (not-advertised) $5/person for the entertainment and fee for a large group
I am enraged that I wasted so much money and time at such a place
If you want bad food, awful service and nasty treatment, than this is your place
The food was terrible
We were a party of six and they refused to put us in the big back room, instead we had to squeeze around this little table
The staff was so rude and nasty, we ended up just leaving without finishing
If you want a houka-- go to one of the other bars in the area (there are a lot)
This experience was just awful!
We ate here recently with with friends and really enjoyed the food
It isn't an upscale restaurant, nor does it pretend to be, but it is flavorful, filling and generally a lot of fun
They do a great job arranging the food so that everybody at the table can sample each dish--order a few and share them so that you can try everything
The outdoor garden is a really nice feature in the summer, especially compared to a fairly dark interior
They were very accommodating of small children as well, which is always nice for those with kids
Don't come here if you are in a hurry, since the service can be a bit slow, and don't order drinks beyond the Ethiopian beer
The waitress really struggled with anything more complicated than that--not sure if it was a language problem or what, but 3 of the 4 drinks we ordered came both late and wrong, including beer brought in place of a cocktail, the wrong wine, and a mystery drink that nobody had ordered
The beer goes better with the food anyway, and it is nice and cold

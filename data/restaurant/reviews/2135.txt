food was great
we were upstairs
ambiance was great and excellent service from friendly upstairs manager(handsome)
Everthing about this restaurant was special
i highly recommended
thanks
Dined here and loved it! The service is slow but that is turkish culture
Allows you time to enjoy your meal and company, excellent for a date
Next best thing to Turkey without being there, authentic
Can't wait to go back, curbs my cravings till my next trip to Turkey!
I love their food and service
They serve authentic Turkish food
Their menu includes different varieties of Turkish food besides the kebabs
This place is always busy so that should mean something!
One of the best Prix Fix lunch values ($13
95) I've had in the city
They give you more way more food than you can eat (especially for lunch) and the food was incredible
I had the Humus-Iskander-Baklava Prix Fix and each eas exceptional
My frined had the Lamb Shis Kabob and he equally enjoyed it
Definitely going back
I have dined here many times in the past
In terms of Turkish food I think they are one of the best in NYC and they have been quite consistent about it
The service is below average
Waiters are not refined
I find the low ceiling and dark red colored painted walls a tad depressing
What I came to dislike about this place is their management
They are very rude even towards the customers
They are more like soup Nazis
Once the manager loudly referred to the customers patiently waiting at the all-you-can-eat buffet line as 'hungry animals attacking for food'
I love the Turkish Kitchen
Great place for a date or with the girls
The food is very good
The staff can be a bit slow at times
Go if you have plenty of time and enjoy
You will have to wait if you don't have a reservation on the weekend nights

A friend brought me to the Turkish Kitchen for the prix-fixe lunch
First, I was surprised by the sexy red decor
Despite the hour of the day, I had one of their colorful Martinis - it was delicious! The choices for lunch were numerous, each one better than the other
And for such a great price, you get more food than needed in the middle of the day
Leave room for dessert! I can only imagine how great this place is after dark
We found the place from the web
In fact it was higher than our expectations
The food is great, the service is slow but the presentation of food is great
These people really know that the God is in the details
The hospitality is as expected from a high class restaurant
The Food is a classical sample of great Turkish - mediterrean Kitchen which I believe one of the best in the world
A group of four of us entered Turkish Kitchen on a frigids snowy day
Our coats were immediately removed from our shoulders and sent away
Although not having a reservation, we were seated immediately
The place was quite bustling the entire time that we dined
Stained with red paint, the walls gave off a warm feeling
The cultured wait staff were accommodating and helped explain and pronounce the items off the menu
Service was REALLY slow (as others have said previously, it may be a cultural thing)
Creative cocktails were delicious (taste the Bronx and the Brooklyn - however, I would've preferred if they left the tumblers on the table as they did not pour out the entire drink, leaving some to waste!) Portions are all tasty, so be prepared to share with one another!!
Absolutely GREAT food, and if you're in the mood for a relaxing meal, then this is the place for you
However, if you have somewhere to be after eating, you might want to think twice, since the staff seems to be in NO hurry to get you out the door
It could be cultural
One meal I had seemed like an eternity, another was enjoyable
I was here on a date and was not that impressed
The food was pretty ordinary
I have had much better Turkish food in NYC, specifically at Dervish Turkish in the theater district (not the best date place but great and reasonably priced food, especially the prixe fixe and great with friends and family)
Our water was served warm with no ice and the waitress was awful, not rude, just unhelpful and boring
The pro about this place is that the decor is nice for a small group or date
It was filled up but not suffocatingly crowded or loud
Not enough to make me go back
My wife and I Honeymooned in Turkey a year ago and over the past few months, I've been searching for that delicious dish called Iskender Kebab
We came upon this place by accident and were lucky that it was still early enough that we didn't need a reservation
I ordered the Iskender and was very impressed
It reminded me of the dish I ate at a small restaurant in Bursa! Delicious! My wife had a fish dish and while it was a bit salty, it was quite good
The selection of Turkish wines (yes, Turkish wines) was limited, but we found one that we had tried in Turkey and it was as good as we remembered it
I'll definitely be back (but next time, I'll make a reservation)
I had my first experience with the sublime cuisine of Turkey here, and I cannot wait to return! Service was very professional and knowledgeable (and handsome!)
Decent selection for vegetarians as well
We started with mezze (three appetizers), then shared the balik--whole bass
Try the raki as well for the whole Turkish experience
This is one of my favorites restaurants in new york
so delicious
Love the fried calimari, the feta/phyllo rolls, the roasted baby eggplant w/garlic yogurt, and the chicken/lamb in tomato and garlic yogurt
heavenly
I have dined at Turkish Kitchen several times
The food is always delicious, as are the Turkish Kitchen Martinis
I would recommend Turkish Kitchen to anyone that likes Turkish food
Although the veggie fare was slim-pickins, it was so yummy! The feta-filo rolls are decadent and delightful
The appetizer menu is mouth-wateringly good, with yummy hummous and giant salads
The atmosphere is dreamy and romantic
The service is the best I've had in New York!
Portions are ample, the lamb is tender and well seasoned, whether it's surrounded by eggplant, sitting on garlic yogurt or just the plain chops
The Iskender kabob is our son's favorite, which is on top of a nice sauce
It's large enough for two though he refuses to share
Appetizers are intriguing, whether it's the light, roasted eggplant (smokey and yummy), fried calamari, whatever
We've pretty much liked everything we've had here
Even the roasted vegetable plate, a main course, is special as it sits atop the roasted eggplant and is ample and tasty
Desserts are also good
We've always had nice service though our last experience was different
The waiter was inattentive and almost rude
There's an upstairs and downstairs and it's generally possible to get seated without a reservation, though why take chances?
NYC's best Turkish restaurant
Unfortunately it has grown so popular as to attract some unsavory types (loud drunks, cell phone addicts etc)
I loved the food and the martinis at the restaurant

The pizza here is absolutely incredible
There a like 25 toppings to choose from, and you just get the feeling that the chef puts care into each pizza he is creating
The chopped salad was awsome too
For a pasta, I recommend the Ziti, Pancetta, Pecorino and Peas
excellente
The Food is wondeful
you will want to taste everything! I recommend starting with a couple of inches of pizza, a half salad, and a pasta dish
Try the bread crumb topping for the pizza
The baked pink shells are fantastic
The servers are helpful, attentive and friendly
A wonderful atmosphere
If you haven't been there, you need to go!
In the mood for pizza but want something a little better than Ray's or Patsy's? Pinch is the perfect place
First -- the pizza
Thin-crust, really great toppings (esp
the pepperoni), and a more elegant dining experience than those other places
Try it and you'll see what I mean
Also, they have a full menu of salads, pastas and entrees, too
The ambience is very nice - not dark enough for a first date, but plenty clean and cool enough for a second and beyond
For a full meal or a quick 6 inches and a beer, Pinch is good stuff
I've been here several times already and the pizza is pretty good but it's definitely over priced
If you're planning on having a party and serving pizza - it's gonna cost you to order from this place
If they're going to charge that much - atleast make it worth while
the slices are WAY too thin and cost WAY too much
as for the taste, as one reviewer put it, it does taste like tombstone pizza
whats up with that? the service was great, good people are working there
but the product just isn't that great
if you're looking to spend money and want to feel hungry and robbed after eating, then go here
As a regular patron of Patsy's and other pizza venues in Manhattan, I found a new home for my pizza needs
PINCH offers up a combination of great things- a clean restaurant with an attentive wait staff, a good price point on its pizzas by the inch, terrific apps including the chopped salad, and wonderful homemade unique pasta dishes that could easily serve more than one patron
Lastly, it's nice when the owners take a vested interest in your dining experience
If you want a personal feel with great food, don't wait to become a regular at PINCH
I left satisfied, full, and without a dent in my wallet
Pinch has wonderful pizza
thin crispy excellent toppings and what a creative way to serve pizza
ordering by the inch gives you the ability to try many combinations
I recomend the hot sausage topping
the pasts is cooked to perfection
and the sauce is great
the chicken was super as well
bottom line PINCH is a much needed addition the the area
Great food good atmosphere need I say more
try it for yourself
Remember Tombstone pizza? The kind that comes in the freezer section of your grocery store? Well this is what it looked like and tasted like too
I wound up paying $4
00 for what would equal one slice in a normal pizza place -- and I only had one topping
This will definitely not become my regular pizza joint, but I will say that the salads looked mighty tasty -- especially a grilled shrimp version -- and those prices would not break the bank
I'm not interested in Patsy's or Grimaldi's any more
This is the best pizza for miles and miles
The crust is perfect and the homemade sausage and roasted garlic will make me walk from anywhere
Pinch rocks
Pizza and salad i had were a cut above and i shall definitely head back for the baked chicken with herb potatoes the smell of which was just
yummy
Nice staff and good service
Pinch--The best thing to happen to NYC--the pizza capital of the world! Not only is the pizza by the inch the best pizza of any kind in New York City, all the food on the menu is as tasty and flavorful as the pizza
I eat here 3-4 times a week to fill my addiction
Buzzing at lunch during the week, and a cool, smooth fun spot for dinner in the evening
Order a chopped salad, at least 10-12, have a cold beer, and chat it up with Todd and Matthew, the awesome owners
The Scene A futuristic fast-food counter, with a seat-yourself dining nook, attracts local lunchers for quick stops during the day
But at night, heavily accessorized fashion types traipse through the front room en route to the alter-ego lounge, where groups sip pricey martinis on lipstick-red banquettes set behind low, scratched-mirror tables; others shoot pool or chat at the ultramodern bar
Loud beats and artfully askew movie projections complete the vibe
The waitstaff can be hard to track down and uninformed about the menu
The Food The fast-food menu is tiny
Two juicy mini burgers are slathered with Russian dressing, cheese and tomatoes on a crusty brioche
The hot-dog duo and super-thick milk shakes stand out, but fries come oily and onion rings heavy on the batter
Lounge offerings are passable, with too-greasy shrimp rolls accompanied by sesame-scented dip and a lobster club featuring citrus-zested mayo
You don't know what your talking about
Pop Burger is awful
Most of time the chef would send bussers to Western beef to buy ground meat, not ground beef, lol
never buy booze here, the bar marries top shelf (like grey goose) with well (crystal palace)
Many of the sauces sit in the basement for hours on end with no cover-ON THE FLOOR
buggies, rodents, yep! The mushroom burger is ok though, lol
Heard about how great this place was but once I took a bite of my glorified overcooked white castle burger I realized that people aren't going here to get good food, they're going for a created hipster scene thats a safe haven for all the late night bridge-and-tunnel drunks coming back from the clubs in the area
These tiny over-priced burgers are served blackened whether you specify or not
It tasted like they cooked up an old tire and put it between two pieces of fancy bread
I guess people are too wasted to tell the difference
Don't be fooled by the people who tell you this place is good
If you were coming back from one of the clubs or you work near the place your opinions are obviously skewed
If you want a fantastic burger make a trip to madison square park to Shake Shack, a better burger

com/ Dam ok Bite for Bite Pop Burger is def one of my favorite burgers in NYC
For 5 bucks  you get 2 mini burgers with lettuce and a plum tomato slice
I think a lot of people just pass over this place as a novelty Oh you mean the mini burger dance club but if these puppies where full sized I am sure they would be on most peoples favorite list
The Quality of these burgers is top notch
The size is the only thing they have in common with White Castle (well other than hitting the spot after a night of partying or riding a cheetah across the woods of NJ)  While its not as model clad or posh as some of its neighborsthe last time I checked you couldnt get a plate of awesome burgers with your Grey Goose bottle at Hiro
This place was cracking
It was perfectly crowded with a young and hot crowd
The musice wasn't unorigional and the servers were fine
Drinks werent overpriced and the food was perfect for the moment
No more late night deli stops after the clubs
This place has it all, and its a guaranteed good time
This is an Amazing restaurant/bar to eat at for the younger older generation
The service could have been better but overall its a fantastic spot to unwind
After 11 the crowd slowly starts to grow there Flirtini is a great drink but be careful it will catch up to you
This is def a great recommendation for a date
The mini PoP burgers are just the right size coming two in a box and the other diner classics are just as tasty! The lounge menu is to die for, especially the lobster nachos and calamari! Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is hot and quick and the atmosphere is swanky with a rock and roll vibe! The music is great and the decor is not the only eye candy to enjoy!
This place is ok
extremely trendy, but mostly filled with the bridge and tunnel crowd that seems to be ever-present in the meatpacking district
Drinks are over priced but then again, drinks cost a lot practically everywhere in NYC

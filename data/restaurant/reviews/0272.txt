Chips cost you money, you have to order it
Food came after over an hour, even though there is no wait to get in (now I know why)
I had shrimp with garlic sauce
The Mexican place across from my building served much better for $6 rather than $22
Maybe go there for the view, but don't bother eating there, go to the bar
Half an hour is enough to view the Sea Port
I love to go here in the summer
they leave the doors open and u can eat outside with a view of the skyline
the food is great
the drinks are fabulous
I had a couple of bday gatherings there and all of my guests enjoyed their food very much
It was my first time at this restaurant and had made reservations for 14 for my bf's bday
Everyone wasn't here yet because they were looking for parking, etc and the hostess guy was threatening to give up our table if our entire party wasn't together in 10 min
I thought that was kind of rude, considering there weren't even people waiting to be seated there
The waitress was very tentative to our needs and the food came out pretty quickly
The bill came out to quite a lot though, considering there were 14 of us some of us ordered way too many drinks
I suggest getting a pitcher to save money on individual drinks
And since we had such a large group, it was difficult to talk to everyone
They just put tables together, forming a long table, so not everyone was able to talk/hear everyone
Been here on various occaions, the ambience is great with the view of the river
The food is great, the menu has a lot of selection and if you not sure ask the waiter for the daily specials
Everything is great in this place
Nice Spanish/Carib/Mex cuisine on the top floor of SS Seaport Mall
Wonderful food service - decent prices
The Ojitos're great! and the food's delicious
Great for a big group
the service is pretty good
Loved the food and the music
Its great food for a great price
Service was good, but after ordering the appetizer she forgot about our table
The view is beautiful
My friends celebrated my birthday there and was pleasantly surprised to say the least
I was hesitant to go there since it is at the Seaport - which in my experience, Seaport restaurants are middle of the road and uninspiring - basically tourist joints
The food and service were great
Lively atmosphere, great for groups, families, couples -- everyone
There were 4 other birthday dinners going on at the same time, a big indicator that this is a highly popular restaurant
We left the restaurant satisfied from not only the quality and quanitity of the food, but also that it didn't hurt everyone's pockets!!
In Short Maybe it's Palermo, maybe Salamanca, but it's definitely not Park Slope
Candlelight, distressed paint, agricultural tools on the walls: These folks have the rustic Mediterranean look down cold
Unless you're up on your culinary Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, you'll probably need help with the menu, and servers oblige
Expect dishes like artichokes stewed with guanciale (cured hog jowl), a casserole of bacalhau (salt cod) and potatoes, and shepherd's pie
I'm from Spain so I always wanted to try this place that it's a mix of Gallicia (a reagion in the north of Spain), Italian and Portuguese
I went there and I wasn't dissapointed at all
The food was delicious and they also give you good portions of food, which I really appreciate
The service was really attentive even though we were in a table far away from everybody
I have been here 3 times and everytime has been incredible
Always order the antipasti
If the rib eye is the special you have to get it
The wine list is excellent
If you are trying to save money this isn't the place this is for a robust night of eating and drinking and spending alot but really enjoying it
The basement is a great place for a huge party
The place is small therefore you will wait if you don't set up ahead of time
I don't know what rude is in the italian but after visiting this restaurant I know what a rude italian is
Our humble anticipations of a good meal in a pleasant atmosphere were totally scraped by the staff of this restaurant
From the meeting at the door to the end of the meal we felt unwelcomed at this place
Such a contrast to many other italian restaurants we have visited in the city !  There is no need to write about the food as it is mediocre at best
Chao, you won't see us here again !
I went there with my boyfriend at the time and the service was horrible
We were seated then told there were several reservations that night and asked to move to another table where we were then told we would probably have to move again
All before we even had a chance to order
The staff didnt seem apologetic or even concerned that they were disrupting us
We were then told that the only available table was in the basement in the wine cellar
At this point we were so disgusted we left - who want to eat alone in a cellar? I was really disappointing because there were some good reviews about the restaurant and we were really looking forward to a nice meal
My wife and I go out to eat a lot
A couple of weeks ago we discovered this fantastic gem hidden in the fringes of Park  Slope's 5th ave
It's become our favorite restaurant from the great food to the rustic but elegant ambiance to the smart servers
Everything is authentic, and I get the feeling I'm in a small town in Italy or Spain
Favorites for me: the wine  cellar (it's very romantic), the oxtail pasta and the steak for two (crazy good)
My wife's favorites: artichoke appetizer  (like no other artichoke you've ever eaten), the poached seabass , and the chocolate tart
Only thing is the one time we went there on a saturday it was very busy and I felt less comfortable sitting and enjoying the atmosphere over a glass of port after our feast
I recommend trying this place out during the week
Think twice before making reservations on Valentines Days or other high volume days
The restaurant was over booked and as a result I waited 30+ minutes to be seated
My girlfriend and I were not alone
More than half the small top floor was crowed with couples waiting to be seated
The staff seemed indifferent and insisted that the diners would all finish at the same time
They failed to offer us even a free drink as a gesture
Once seated I was disappointed by the pre fixe which offerred only two choices for each course, which were mostly disappointing
The food seemed hit or miss
That said, the atmosphere was extremely charming and romantic
As recent Brooklynites, we went here for the first time (and only time without a reservation) in the early summer
Best points: Decor- it is amazing
Very romantic
Try to get a table in the wine cellar, it is fabulous
Food: Wow
You think the 3 cuisines won't mix or translate, but it is unbelievably good
Wine: Excellent
Staff knows a lot about the wine list it is really comprhensive interesting
Staff: There's a maitre de (or head waiter?) who is so accomodating and friendly, he's our favourite
The bus staff is also excellent
You feel as though you don't even realise you're being waited upon
We love this restaurant
Much like another reviewer on here, I joined City Search just to review this restaurant
It is incredibly overpriced for a small Park Slope restaurant, and the food is not up to par
The chicken liver appetizer had a different flavor every time I took a bite, and the Mediterranean bream fish had almost no flavor
I also found the seats to be very uncomfortable
To top it off, they dont take Visa or Mastercard, which I havent heard of since the 80s
Save your money and go somewhere else in the Slope that has better food and actually has comfortable chairs
I agree this restaurant is too pricey for the neighborhood
And it's sad because we'd eat here more often, but as it is now it's a rare and special occasion when we eat at Convivium, simply on principle when all we're doing is heading out for a bite to eat in the 'hood

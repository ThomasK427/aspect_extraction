They did not offer Bellinis (a traditional Italian cocktail!)
Also the drinks and the portions were small
Between the two of us, our bill was $75! I guess I was expecting too much from a place called Vincent's in Little Italy
Food was good, not great
for new york city, the food and service here is a steal
the waitstaff is so nice and the food so authentic
try the sweet sauce!
After waiting for nearly 30 minutes to be seated (there's always a line at Vincents) we were pleased by the prompt service
This is NOT Americanized Italian food, so don't go there expecting Olive Garden-like food
The sauces taste exactly like my Italian-born grandmother used to make, and the food really is quite good, and the prices reasonable
The only thing bad about the restaurant was the line for the bathrooms, so ladies - be prepared to wait for the single stall
The restaurant has been operated by the same family since 1904 and with one taste you'll see why they've been in business so long
Just for the sauce - a choice of sweet and sour, medium or hot, it is worth the trip from New Jersey
The staff is friendly and attentive
At Vincent's you can enjoy a wonderful Italian dinner, in a relaxed atmosphere at a reasonable cost! It's a must try - just once you'll definitely return
The food is o
k
But, this place is really a tourist trap
Why go here and spend money when you could make a better meal at home for less
There are plenty of authentic italian restaurants which offer better food, ambience, and value in NYC
Vincent's is all about turnover, not about service or quality
Take my word for it, my third visit (tonight) will be my last
I brought my friend here for her birthday with 3 others, and guess what? It was so terrible that I felt compelled to write this review
Nobody at our table even ate more then one or two bites! I can't believe I was recommended this place
Please, if you read this, heed the warning, my niece could make better food than this
Its terrible
Plain and simple
I went to this restaurant for the first time last weekend
All of Little Italy was mobbed, and we found this restaurant
With few people inside, I was leery, to say the least
Boy, was I surprised! The food was all homemade, the sauce tasted like it was cooked for 12 hours, and it was all delicious! We had a very nice waiter
There were three of us in our group and we only had entrees and coffee, but the bill only came to $53! I was very pleased
One thing I would have changed--the portion size of my dinner
I had lobster ravioli, and there were only 9 small sized raviolis on the plate
The other two entrees that were ordered were very large portions
Other than that, we had a delicous dinner
I can't wait to go back again!
I've eaten here several times over many years, and the food is tasty, inexpensive and plentiful
The atmosphere is appropriately shabby and the service is perfunctory and a bit slow but capable enough
Two curiosities: on my last two visits, the salad's lettuce had clearly seen better days, and on my last visit, I was told that I couldn't have coffee at the end of the meal (we were asked to go next door!) Very odd, but the entrees make up for the shortcomings
Came in 8/02 with friends from Boston Had been planning for months to get together Bought Tickets for Lion King We wanted to see Litle Italy Coming from Italian section of Boston wanted somthing family run etc Heard of luna FAMILY RUN? Place was run by non englsh speaking busboys and waiters We were seated promptly our Server Antonio (who at first seemed so attentive ) Made suggestions (high priced I may add ) Next time we saw him was when we complained waited 45 min 4 food We filled up on garlic bread
When our meal arrived we were full
Asked for our check (waited another 1/2 hr) check arrived with sambuca sweets and hefty service charge We are not European and the menu didnt mention service charge Ps We missed our show VERY DISSAPOINTED
Luna is the quintessential Italian restaurant
We stepped in and were immersed in hospitality
We were made to feel like family
The food was wonderful and plentiful
What started as lunch became the highlight of the day
Luna provides everything you would hope to find in at trip to Little Italy with an attentive, knowledgable staff, reasonable prices, and wonderful food
The decor makes up for what it lacks in frills in comfort and authenticity
As an Italian living in NY, I generally cringe at Little Italy's overpriced mediocre food served by faux-charming waiters who insist on calling me Bella
Although there was a hint of this tourist-trap stereotype at Benito's, I admit that I was pleasantly surprised by their stuffed artichokes
These little babies tasted pretty authentic, which I never would have expected
The manicotti were another story though; the dish reminded me of what we were served at my college cafeteria
The sauce was especially disgusting - it tasted like jarred Ragu
I don't personally see that my friends and I did anything except order, eat dinner and try to enjoy an evening in Little Italy
We did NOT cause any scene or even ask for extra attention
we weren't even offered parmesan cheese or dessert! My friend asked for a capuccino
the respose without even looking up was
we don't make those
while he was adding in his tip to our bill, since when did adding a tip become the norm with only 3 people dining! The food was okay, but I swear the mushrooms were out of a can, no where near fresh
Italians are supposed to take pride in their food
There are plenty of other choices, the food is not worth being rushed
Enjoy your dinner somewhere else!
The best italian food i had in a long while
The service is outstanding! affordable gourmet meals!
You people that could possibly rate this restaraunt low obviously don't know what Quality Italian food is supposed to taste like
Also being Italian, I appreciate the at home feeling I get while in the place
The waiters joke with you and you feel as if they are your cousins and momma is in the kitchen whipping up some of the best food you will ever eat in your life! If you want your food to taste like it was masswed produced and rushed, and you want to be pampered, don't come here
But if great food and an authentic Italian family atmosphere is what you want
this is the place hands down
The place was featured on the food channel for Gods sake!!
i ve been there around ten times and was always very please with my experiences
starting with the food wich is really well done in a strait forward way
rich textures authentic feel i think i remember seing the same chef 5 times big man serving you like an aubergiste in an italian way
value is excelent
i ve tried about six restaurant in little italy and this stays my favorite
I recently went on a vacation to New York City with my mom, my friend and her mom and we ate at this cute restaurant in Little Italy
The waiters are so cute and the food is delicious
I highly recommend eating there, plus their price seems reasonable after looking at surrounding restaurants
I went for dinner and honestly the food was very good but the service was the worst
You would request the waiters for something and they would bring the wrong thing
It's sad that the food is really good but the service is awful
What else could you ask from a restaurant?? You will have excellent food and wine list and great service - You will not be disappointed no matter what dish you order! Everything is top quality! My husband and I eat out often - For a good restaurant that we like, we will travel hours! Great to have such a wonderful place right here in Little Italy! Very often you will find people from outside of NYC who have traveled here to return to Benito's II - I think that speaks for itself!
Benito's II is one of my favorite restaurants
Veal rollatini and Scicilian Octopus are superb
I just stumbled into the place by accident the first time there
I went there the second time about a month later and the owner remembered that I did not finish my broccoli rab from the first visit! The place is cozy, sometimes a little cramped, but the food and staff make up for any shoulder rubbing
Bring cash, but if you forget, there is an ATM a block away
Nice place, but a good dining experience ruined as the owner bluntly (blunt even for NY) rushes you through dinner - we were there for less than an hour, including appetizers and a nice bottle of wine
Food is very good and the wait staff takes very good care of you
This would be a great place if they could just get the old man to stay home
Be warned - CASH ONLY, but this is not specified until the bill arrives
I saw some people on here rated this place a three, while most others rated it a ten
I don't know how those people can rate it a three
Did they do something, (come in drunk, loud and obnoxious) to receive poor attention or service, or to take away from the taste of the food
I have been there several times and take it from a true Italian
Benito II's food is consistently wonderful and tastes like Nonna is back in the kitchen
The service, small/cozy atmosphere, and price, topped by the food make this #1 in NYC!
My old man and I continue to debate on the merits of Benito2 versus Paesano's

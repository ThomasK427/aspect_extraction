I went back there last night with a party of 7
It was disappointing enough for me to have to write about it
When I first walked in to find empty tables at 7:30pm on a Thursday night, that should have been a sign
Aside from the room being hot, sitting in the back, we had appertiser that were mediocre to say the least, especially the shrimp on skewers, they were cold and overcooked
The main courses, the Grilled Salmon and Chicken was bland
I had the Seabass, very oily
I don't know if they have changed chefs since but it was one of the worst (moderately expensive) restaurant experience I've had in NYC
A major embarassment!
My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Novecento on Memorial Day weekend
The atmosphere is charming the food is excellent and the prices are great! The waiter could have been more amiable, but we didn't let that spoil our dinner
I would highly recommend Novecento to anyone visiting New York City!
i've been going to this joint for all my life in new york, altho they are very famous for thier pork chops, i like thier chicken legs over rice more
it's a must have if you go there
i always order the chicken leg over rice with extra meat sauce or extra relish
for under $5, you can not go wrong
make sure you also order the chinese herbal drink or a chysanthenmum tea to go with your meal ! another thing i love about this place is the fast service, the normal wait for the chicken leg over rice is about 2 minutes
In Short A polished wood bar supports the elbows and pints of neighborhood regulars stopping in for a quick bite, while more serious diners take seats to enjoy dishes like roast chicken with mashed potatoes, "cowboy" chili topped with cheddar and onions, generous cobb and Caesar salads, hamburgers and various sandwiches
Properly poured Guinness and assorted beers and wines by the glass keep the drinking crowds happy
Walkers has everything from great burgers, juicy steaks, to fresh fish, pastas and vegetarian options
Everything is clearly homemade
Can get a little loud but the food is great and the price is right
Service is usually very friendly and very prompt depending on how busy the place is, sometimes it's just efficient
Check out their fabulous brunch
what a deal! Also, you can reserve the back room for private parties and the food and drink just keep coming
very attentive staff
Great brunch food and price
Not much in the way of ambiance, and the service was efficient although not too friendly
Great point is the place is a little out of the way and not crowded which is a plus to me in NYC
Would definitely recommend, especially the chicken breakfast burrito
Was there for Friday dinner
The rice was not throughly cooked and was hard in the middle
I sent the rice back and was told the entire batch was cooked the same
I got potatoes instead but felt sorry for anyone ordering rice that night
Our waitress was unattentive, while another one literally ripped the check out of my hand
I can see how it has the Tribeca neighborhood charm going on, but I was not charmed by its food or service
I had lunch there yesterday and the food service was great
We were promptly seated the service was friendly attentive
Try the chicken polanco (sp) soup, it's a little spicy but really good
I had the Italian sausage hero it was excellent!
Walker's offers a great atmosphere for a fabulous value
Patrons can choose to be seated in the front room with a little more activity and more of a bar feel or in one of the 2 back rooms which both offer slightly quieter, more relaxed environments
Food is primarily classic pub fare (dieters beware), which is tasty and very affordable
It's the perfect place for a couple beers and a quick bite after work
There is almost always a lively crowd at the bar
I highly recommend it if you are up for a low-key fun night out in a great neighborhood
Enjoy
The hamburgers here are truly the best I have ever had!! The cheese was perfectly melted, the pickles were lovely, the meat well cooked
excellent! Also, the best guinness I have ever had in the city AND to top it all off, the bartenders are very friendly as are the regulars who sit at the bar
I went for the first time this past weekend and what a great place!
Not a $15 martini to be found anywhere
That is a good thing
Nice sense of history in this Tribeca old timer
Great steak for cheap, decent wines at bargain prices
Brooklyn Beer on tap -- again a good thing
I go here now that Riverrun is closed and been turned into a charmless art gallery
Excellent neighborhood resturant and bar
Was recommended to my by the concierge at the Tribecca Grand Hotel
Steak, (2)drinks and dessert for under $40
Besides the location, nothing much to recommend the place
Service is very uneven, sometimes curteous, sometimes abominable
Food is just ok, except if you're a vegetarian, in which case you are totally out of luck
Decor is nice, and there are usually tables available
so, i've heard
so far the several times i been there, i have experienced anything but
the service isn't anything to rave about
but the apple brown betty's are a must
i guess i'm a sucker for those
Delicious burgers and great selection of beers
Plus, the staff is friendly and it's not overpriced
you will feel at home at the small but modest little spot
where the people are overly friendly and they will know your name if you return
Pub like food small dining area which tends to get alittle to crowed for my taste but a great little spot to unwind after a hard days work and plenty of singles if your looking
my girlfiend and I never go wrong here and we meet wonderful people everytime, real New Yorkers
Whether it's a burger at the bar, a few rounds of appi
s or a full dinner I have yet to be disappointed and I am usually elated
If you like to eat and not be bothered with pretense this is the place
The long ago Tribeca before the upscale nonsense started!!!
We just love Walker's
We live on North Moore but can't seem to get enough on this place! My husband just LOVES the chopped steak with peppercorn sauce (yes, it's a glorified hamburger but it IS delicious)
Frankly, everything is great at this place
MUCH better than Bubby's down the block
You want a nice pint, some good bar food, and a fun atmosphere then check this palce out
The Pig Whistle is a classic in Tribeca
If you want a place where everybody knows your name, this is certainly IT
The staff is kind and generous and it is a great place to hang
The Scene Sports stars make their way here after an engagement at the Garden; neighborhood celebs like Harvey Keitel constantly pop in and out; and everyone from Bill Murray to Mikhail Baryshnikov is an investor
Oil paintings by part-owner Robert De Niro's father hang on exposed-brick walls (junior's paintings decorate Layla), which, along with an aged-looking wood ceiling, lend the space a warehouse-like feel
The Food Chef Stephen Lewandowski cooks savory dishes like herb-crusted rack of lamb with minted tomatoes and pan-seared red snapper with toasted vegetable orzo
Those in the mood for something lighter can grab a snack at the always-packed bar and unwind with a stiff cocktail
Had dinner with some of my girlfriends for Restaurant Week and I was not impressed at all
We all wanted to try it out since the restaurant seemed to have raving reviews but the food, service, and ambience was mediocre
I've had better food than what I had at Tribeca Grill at less expensive restaurants
I'm not saying that the food here was horrible though - it's pretty good but for the prestige and popularity of the restaurant, but I don't think it lives up to its name
I recently went to Tribeca Grill with a group of girlfriends and we all enjoyed the experience
I had the lamb and it was delicious, a perfect medium rare
My friends had the filet of beef, the braised short ribs and the herb marinated chicken
I took bites from each of their plates and was very pleased with all of them, particularly the short ribs
This is saying a lot because both my mother and my friends mothers make phenomenal short ribs so I have pretty high standards when it comes to this cut of meat
For dessert, most of us had the crme brulee, which was great
I will definitely be going back!

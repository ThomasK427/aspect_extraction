It's a little on the chaotic side, rather than calm and relaxed and it's easy to feel a little cramped
Obviously you end up spending over one houndred dollars per person, which is average for a steak house I guess
In the end I was disappointed with Uncle Jack's and I would recommend other steak houses (such as Dylan Prime) any time for better food, better service, better location and nicer dining environment
This is a beautiful restaurant and atmosphere, great attentive service and unbelievable food
Awesome crabcakes, great salmon, great filet
Good wine selection, also great for private parties upstairs
Will definitely visit again
It's hard to find a restaurant that offers exquisite ambiance, superb customer service and an excellent selection of surf and turf menu items
Uncle Jack not only delivers, he also does it before opening act at MSG
From the moment you take your seat at the table, every member of the wait staff guarantees your every wish is granted
For our appetizer, our waiter recommended a mixed seafood dish
This excellent and fresh selection of seafood goodies took me back to my childhood days of growing up near the Atlantic Ocean
We proceeded with Uncle Jacks Porterhouse signature dish
With just one bite, the taste of this excellent cut of prime steak took me back to my visit in Brazil three years ago
Overall, its good to know that a restaurant near MSG can offer such top notch service and fresh selection of surf and turf
Once you try the Cheeseburger with a cold glass of beer, you can't get that taste out of your head
One of those things that you will crave for every time you are hungry
Many people doesn't even know about Uncle Jack's and it is out of the way, near the Lincoln Tunnel
But it is always worth the trip to enjoy a nice burger or a filet with a cold glass of beer or a good bottle of wine
Tuxedo dressed waiters are simply gentlemen and they do know how to serve with a smile
I would recommend the Cheeseburger, Filet Wrap or the Seared Tuna
Special lunch menu offers dishes for a quick meal or a formal business lunch
You may think the all those trendy steak houses are the place to enjoy a good meal but once you try Uncle Jack's you will decide for yourself
This Mid-town steak house is a good option for a great steak in Manhattan
The location is ideal for either theater or events at Madison square garden
The steaks are prepared with a classic char technique, locking in the flavor and moisture of their dry aged beef
Service was excellent from the hostess to the wait captain
At $40
00 a steak, they are very proud of their food, however the extra few dollars is worth spending for a memorable meal
Went on Saturday night--the waiter was rude and condescending; and primarily interested in jacking up the check
The steak, highly touted, was just okay
Good enough, but for the same prices charged by top steakhouses in NYC, should be as good
It was not, by a long shot
Service was fourth rate
Location is awful
It's an interesting atmosphere, but not worth the trip
Paid $107 for a meal with no alcohol or dessert
We had a wonderful time
Great atmosphere
Good jazz band playing in the background
Our service was really and our servers really attentive
We had oysters and shrimp cocktail as starters wich was really good
As our main course we both had surf and turf (cooked to perfection) with garlic mash, parmesan asparagus and garlic mushrooms
The portions were more then enough we could not finish our plates! I only have good and amazing things to say about this restaurant
We will definitely will go back again
!
Uncle Jacks is one Fabulous restraurant with supurb food,great ambiance and service thats in a class of its own
A little pricey but well worth the expence
A restraurant truly hard to beat
I've been going to the original Uncle Jack's in Bayside Queens and have tried the NYC location a few times
Each time, I wish I had gone to Bayside
The service and ambience are great (just like Queens), but the food didn't taste the same or as good as other steak houses in the city
The steak seemed too charred, the appetizers too salty
This location should learn the cooking methods of Bayside
Until then, I'll stick to Queens or other steak houses in NYC
The food, the service, the atmosphere were all great
I've been there a couple of times and everything was consistentloy great
It is a bit pricey but it's a good value
Awesome staff there
Mixed feelings 4 of us recieved a very warm welcoming and world class service at the the bar! Were seated upstairs and a bald guy presented himself as our Captain
Man that guy could sell his mother if he wanted but that was the problem
He started saying the He was the menu and went off with a 10 !! minute rap about mostly ridicolously priced items that were NOT even on the menu
He was rapping Kobe Beef, Fresh Lobsters, Beluga Caviar, Dom Perignon like every guest was a P
Diddy or D
Trump
He just made us feel so totally unconfortable with his extremely pushy attitude
After 15 min he finally gave us the menu against his will
We ordered 4 Appetizers, 4 Entrees and 3 sides and still he asked if we wanted (a couple of chopped up Lobsters) with our Entrees to share ROFL!!!
Service was excellent
Ambiance was intimate and cozy
Wine recommendations were fantastic
Steak and lobster was excellent and somewhat too plentiful
Dessert was outrageous
Sadly, the bill was excrutiatingly burdensome
This is a great place for very special occasion dining
I don't think it's possible to partake in a full course dinner at less than $150 pp
I find that overly pricey when comparing dining experiences among the best restaurants in NYC
I went to Uncle Jacks last December(2004) and had a fantastic meal
The food, service and ambience were all great
The porterhouse for three was expertly cooked and far more than we could all eat and we did try really hard
Our captain Sean provided excellent service and kept our drinks topped up all night
It certainly isnt cheap(450 bucks for 3) but well worth it
I will definitely be back
The positive reviews for this place are on point
Great service, atmosphere, food
the only downfalls are the prices and the location (a bit out of the way on nineth avenue)
Things you may want to know: They have a ladies night Thursdays so damsels drink gratis from le bar
Thursdays are also Jazz nights when an ensemble sets up during the summer for everyone to enjoy
If you're a business person looking for a meeting spot, ask about their library room equipped with a flatscreen for presentations and a boardroom table all in a private room
In my experience there, my roommate was in extascy when he tried thier cream of spinach
The Oysters Jackafeller are scrumptious as are the crabcakes
Their wine list could use some more by-the-glass items, and some lower end assistance, but ask the sommelier and he'll point you in the right direction
Nice place
I've been to great steakhouses all over the U
S
this one rates at the bottom
The wait captain was condescending towards us
My husband and I had surf turf for 2
The lobster tail was so tough I could barely chew it and didn't finish it
Every steak at our table was overcooked and dry

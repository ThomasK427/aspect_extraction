An incredible meal
probably the best Chinese food I have ever had
The restaurant is a little cramped itself, but once one encounters the food, they are lifted into heaven
Try the Yellowtail tempura, soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup
all fantastic
I think people have mixed things up about this place
This is how its is: If you are a sucker for Shanghai cuisine (for some odd reason), down on your luck and strapped for cash, slim and agile, without a credit card, not culinary spoiled THEN this cramped, noisy, low-life place is for you
Honestly it is
Don't miss it
You'll enjoy it have it's great value for you
For us others, we can get great Dim Sum just around the corner
Don't waste you're time otherwise
having grown up with fantastic shanghaiese food, i was excited to give ngb a try
completely disappointing experience--traditional regional dishes have been completely modified to suit the american palate
i am bewildered at why this restaurant continues to get such consistently good reviews
Good tourist intro to Chinatown food
Our group of 8 was crowded, but received good service and very good food - I'm sure not truly authentic Shanghi-nese, but good just the same
A number of items were 'sold out' but still many so dishes to choose from - definately try the scallion pancake and any of the dumplings
We had 3 kinds of dumplings, lo mein, chow fun, fried rice and beef with Chinese cabbage over rice
(Opt for dessert at Chinatown Ice Cream factory across the street !!)
This place is great! The food is not Shanghainese (I have spent time in Shanghai and I don't like Shanghainese food which tends to be sweet and delicate
) I don't care too much for the dumplings either, but I dream of their three pepper beef
and their fried rice and some of their other dishes are tasty and yummy
The decor and Service
it's Chinatown! Exactly what you should expect for cheapo prices
I must say I enjoyed their soup dumplings more than Joe's,but the other dishes were disappointing
Joe's still serves up the BEST Shanghai Noodles in town, NGB's were flavorless
But, NGB did have delicious pan fried noodles
The rest of our entrees were bland at best
The sauteed baby shrimp was corn starchy, salty, and gelatinized and the dried sauteed string beans were not dried at all, but fresh with not even a hint of sauce or garlic
So, if you are going the dumpling route I say eat at NGB, for everything else, Joe's is still a better choice
NGB was cheaper though
This is hands-down my family's favorite chinese food
We ga roughly 4 times a year (living in the far norther suburbs), but are always recognized and treated great
The owners are VERY kid-friendly, moving families with little-ones to the front of the line (discretely)
The food is fantastic and plentiful
Their fried pork dumplings alone are worth the trip
To summarize - this gem spoiled my family for our favorite San Francisco / Chinatown reataurant!
Out of everything before noon and what was available was not good
Among other things, the dumplings and buns were little bags of grease
Yes, it's cheap, but still not worth the price
Definitely up to the high ratings this site gave it
Obviously the previous ratings are all over the place and at either extreme
I can only say that the soup dumplings are almost as good as Joe's Shanghai and some dishes I had (like Eight Spice appetizer) were tasty while others (Shanghai style Shumai) were less so
I am not from Shanghai, but the criticism that the staff is not is unfair, since no matter what style of food prepared in Chinatown, most of the staff is always Cantonese, whether the restaurant be Malaysian or Szechuan
Anyone thinking this is authentic Shanghai taste is sorely mistaken
All dishes have been adjusted for American preferences (bland, missing spices and wok heat)
Look inside, where are all the Chinese customers? Place appear busiers than usual because there are fewer than 10 tables
Even Joe's Shanghai taste better! Highly praised steamed pork buns have inconsistent taste
You can watch your noodles being made before you eat them
Freshest Chinese noodles
Tasty food
You must pay with cash, but you won't need much
Best prices
Don't go for ambiance
Go and enjoy the food and have a good time
looking for great chinese food? well, go to green bo
it's a bit ghetto, but the food is amazing
make sure you get the soup dumplings
they make it right when you order it, so it's fresh
much better than joe shanghai's and much cheaper too
the thing to get is the over rice dishes which are about 3
50-4 bucks each
two thumbs up!
Clearly there is a reason for the popularity - I got there at 6:30 and for the next hour and a half, there was a line out the door of people waiting to get seated
The waiters were very friendly
They seemd to circulate through pretty quickly, and were the most diverse crowd I have seen in a New York res, EVER
Everything we had, especially the appetizers, was fantastic and the portions were huge
My wife is from Shanghai
In chinatown usually choose to eat at Green Bo - especially the cold appetizer menu
The whole fish is delicious and the portions are generous
Occasionally the food is a miss
Although you may have to wait and the service is probably hit or miss, don't miss out on the food - - it is so tasty! I'm not sure where the others with the lessor reviews ate, but this place serves delicious food at ridiculously low prices
The food is well worth any hassles you will incur
It's NOT the most authentic Shanghai in Chinatown
Does the Citysearch reviewer actually know enough to be able to say that or has s/he been listening to clueless self-styled foodie types who for some reason have chosen this restaurant as the best Shanghai in Chinatown? The irony is there are authentic places in Chinatown, and maybe NGB was one, but now is making enough $ off tourists and would-be foodie mavens to worry about food quality
The food was so not Shanghai, but apparently those in the crowded dining room and waiting for tables wouldn't know the difference
Neither the staff nor any of the diners spoke Shanghaiese and I suspected the food was not only made by a non-Shanghai person, but possibly a non-Chinese person, at least the prep cooks, because it was so unbelievably far-off from Shanghai-food even Chinese cooks from other parts of China should know better
Checked this place out after noticing it on Citysearch's Best of Lists
We were very disappointed
The food is sub-standard compared to most other Chinatown eateries
It's grubby, dirty and not good value
Delicious! The best bet for amazing food at ridiculously low prices
Long waits and less than attentive service are the only drawbacks, but the food is worth it
Been here a few times and food has always been good but service really suffers when it gets crowded
Small bathroom is down a steep flight of stairs
Recommend the steamed dumplings and wonton noodle soups
My friends and I daydream about being transported to Chinatown and seated at a table at New Green Bo
The helpings are John Bunyan-sized and the food is so tasty
it's impossible to restrain yourself here! This is definitely one restaurant where you get up from the table satiated (for the next 72 hours) and have to renege on hitting Little Italy for dessert
you'd rather walk to Brooklyn and back!
The atmosphere is right out of a cheap takeout joint
Food is more or less the same
I have to admit the prices are pretty cheap
However, I won't recommend you bring your date
The Best Steamed Dumplings in China town
Efficient service and alternative, light dishes make this a perfect summer dining experience
The food is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Listen, if you don't mind a little bit of waiting, this place is for you
The Lo Mein is the best I have ever had
It is that good

That blind date went so well that we are married now and try to return to Peasant as much as possible
The osso buco is my husband's fav
I love the gnocchi
The fires burning in the kitchen warm us on cold winter nights and the food is as good as it was 3 years ago
The wine list is actually much larger and when we can't get a res
we go to their wine bar
Peasant still puts us in the mood for love!!!
Making a reservation for last night, we recalled the number of times we had delicious meals at Peasant, the people we recommended the restaraunt to who loved it, the personable service
Times flies
When served last night, the food was of such low quality it was astounding
Dishes tasted and were settled together like leftovers
Our simple side of beans were limp, mushy and awash in butter
This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill
6 of us dined last nite at Peasant
We were seated promptly
Food was outstanding, ambiance warm - really lovely
But our waited had such attitude
He was rude on several occassions
That said, the manager could not have been lovelier and made up for it
Even with Mr
Snootypants, we will still go back
Our gnocci was outtanding, and the wine list was great - numerous bottles in all price ranges
Very warm, relaxing room
The waiter was helpful and knowledgeable
Appetizers inlcluding the octopus were tasty
The skate was delicious
The Gnocci was also terrific
Very lively downtown feel to the room but comfortable enough that we saw families early
Overall, very enjoyable
Loved the place- great ambiance, warm, and great space- loved the woodburning oven in the back
the appetizers were so-so- we had the sardines that were VERY bony and the octupus that was a bit rubbery- but the bucatini and lasagna special with rabbit was excellent
All in all, we would definetely go back- very nice bar scene as well
I think there's sharp disagreement among reviewers because Peasant is a little bit of a Euro/hipster place right now and because the service is a tad snotty
Maybe some wouldn't find the room romantic (I did - dark lighting, warm brick walls, fire burning in the kitchen stove), but this place has great ambience simply because the tables are spread apart - no crowding at all
Service was ok
But what's really important is the food, which was awesome
I wasn't totally blown away by the caviar spaghetti, though it was good
The sardines and octopus were excellent and the pizza with speck and arugula was one of the best I've ever had (I think all the pizzas would be amazing)
This is a great place to bring large groups and parents from out of town
Peasant has simplicity down to a science
Decor is simple, cozy, and very comforting
Everything I've tried on the menu has been exquisite, and i have eaten there MANY times
I always bring out of town guests, much to their delight
The idea of a completely wood burning kitchen is so novel, and a wonderful sight to behold
most importantly, the the food it turns out is unbeatable
The simple grilled fish served with herbed olive oil is surprisingly sublime, the gnocci the lightest and most delicious, osso bucco and steak are amazing for meat lovers, the pizza is perfection
actually, if i could recite the whole menu, i wouldnt have enough superlatives
wine list is varied,interesting and reasonable, and the staff is knowledgable, and eager to help
i could go on, but i'm out of room
peasant is a consistently good experience
in fact, i'm on my way there now!!
Peasant was not very pleasant
It is over rated and the service was not as expected
The food was not all that bad
As for the dessert, never got a chance to eat it as the waiters were eager to clear the table
Overall, it was not a good experience and definetly never going back
This place was just perfect
The food was incredible, the service was so attentive, and our waiter was very likeable
I loved the dim lit atmosphere and anyone who gives this place a bad review is just pretentious and doesn't know what they are talking about
Even the people in the restaurant seemed to have a great cheer about them
Peasant is just a great place to bring friends,a date or your parents
LOVE IT !!!
I had such a great meal here
The decor is very romantic, and our waiter was helpful and perceptive
And the food! I had a spaghetti with caviar that I dreamt about all night!
We had a good dinner at Peasant
Once the waiter recited the menu to us we were able to tell what was available
Not overfriendly service but still good
Great pastas
I ate at Peasant for the second time on Saturday evening
While I appreciate the atmosphere and genuine italian menu selections, I was SHOCKED by the service charge automatically tagged onto my meal
A $154 dinner for two with a $68 tip included?!@# If memorizing the menu costs that much, I'd rather bring my own italian/american dictionary and pocket the money
Way too presumptious for me
loved everything from the ricotta cheese they put on the table to the osso bucco with risotto, wish i understood their menu its all in italian, not good for a sweed
i must say peasant has been terrific to me in the last few years,except for those common stupid things everyone i know complains about,the menu in all italian, mean hostess,who screams at her staff in front of customers,,but food,amazing, now i went to there sister restaurant apizz, wow was i surprised,menu in english and italian,hostess nice and friendly, and food simple and also amazing,especially the pizza,, i am torn between these 2 great places,anyway thanks guys for making my wife cook much less these days
simply delicious,osso bucco to die for, and sardines cooked in a pizza oven,oh yeah,nice people to,
Had one of my best dining experiences in NYC at Peasant
Amazing food (love the ricotta), very friendly service (waitress read the whole menu without us having to ask and was very attentive)
Don't pay attention to the negative reviews - this is a great restaurant, w/ a cozy atmosphere, and delicious food!
great date place
good food to, i think this room is the most original i have seen in a while so simple,
Peasant is an uncomfortable restaurant that has some real attributes but ultimately fails
The room is set up so that there is really NO intimacy or comfort
A large dining room is stuffed with small tables and chairs on top on each other
The service was extremely poor from the time we asked for a table NOT crammed between two other couples (they said they had reservations, yet no one arrived before we had finished our meals) till the time we left
I found it ironic that a restaurant named Peasant would employ wait staff that spoke down to their clients
(Excuse us if we don't read Italian and can't understand the menu) I thought the restaurant would be a welcoming, unpretentious addition to my neighborhood when in reality it was a snotty waste of time
It's a shame because the pasta was very tasty
I won't be back
Aside from the waitress having to recite the entire menu because it was written in Italian the restaurant was good
The whole cooked sardine appetizer was very tasty
The gnocci in a vegetable sauce was different -- but also good
It was freezing outside and the restaurant was extremely warm
I felt like I was sitting in a brick oven (the brick walls didn't help the feeling!)
Our party of four showed up 15 minutes late and were seated with no hassle
The ossobucco was fantastic, probably the best I've had
I sampled the venison, also great, and gnocchi in mushroom sauce which was excellent
The fresh mozzarella appetizer was another winner served with olives, green peppers, and roasted peppers
The Prosciutto salad was served with huge chunks of delicious parmesan
The red wine by the glass (I don't recall the brand but they only serve two) and the Italian lager were on the money

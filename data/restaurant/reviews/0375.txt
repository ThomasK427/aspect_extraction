The food is incredible
The entire staff made us feel completely welcome
The restaurant had a great aura about it, and the piano was the perfect addition to an all around wonderful experience
I recommend this place for any and all occassions
Do not be swayed by the negative reviews! Trio is an undiscovered gem amongst all the trendy and snobby places that seem to pop up on every corner now a days
From the staff knowing your name after just one visit (I was pleasantly surprised!), to the lovely live piano music which is such a rarity, my dining experiences at Trio have always been wonderful
And a must is trying the different grappas offered after dinner, what a way to end an enjoyable meal! Trio is truly terrific!
The menu has an excellent selection, the wines are inexpensive, and the live piano on Friday nights make dinner here an incredibly relaxing evening
Be prepared to spend at least $100 though
I recently went to Trio for a birthday celebration
It's a great place to go with a large group; we had the small room on the bottom floor all to ourselves
The $30-something price fix was a great deal; the salmon dish I had was fantastic
I've dined here several times and each time have had a wonderful dining experience
The service was attentive but not solicitous
The atmosphere was warm
with a luscious charm
condusive to cosy conversation
The food was delicious
And try the crepe desert
absolutely wonderful
My husband and I went last night
it was our first time there and they treated us like family
The restaurant was small and very comfortable
Even though there was a large party seated next to us, the restaurant was still quiet and romantic
The service was great and the food was very good and creative
The made our birthday celebration truly special and even gave us a bottle of wine as a gift! I will be going back here for sure! It is amazing when you find a New York restaurant that values its clients and shows it
Thanks Trio!
I had lunch here the day before I left for Dubrovnik - I wanted to get a taste of what to expect
The food and the wine was great
The Dalmation plate is more than enough for two
I had the pasta dish Struki which was great
I tried and Croatian white and red - both very good
Service was great and the room is nicely designed
I'm defintely coming back for dinner soon
Come here to eat and be treated like royalty
Everyone at Trio, the host, chef, servers, bartenders, goes out of the way to make sure that your dining experience is perfect
James, the chef, comes up with truly imaginative and delicious dishes
Trust the servers recommendations
Not once has the food or service failed to impress me or the dozens of guests Ive introduced to Trio
Theres a huge wine list and I have yet to find one that misses
Oh, and the desserts
ohhh
I've eaten here at least a dozen times, and it never disappoints
From the service, which is always excellent, to the chef, James Rich, every single part of the restaurant is a joy
I've gotten to the point that I ask the chef what to eat that night and he takes it from there
I recommend it to all!
Had a great experience at Trio
staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto
You will find everything about Trio to your liking!!
The Scene  The walls of the narrow space are salmon-colored and decorated with blowups of fishing flies
Catering to a clientele of travelers, service is friendly enough and highly competent
The Food  A pleasant array of fish dishes prepared with creative flair and complemented by well-selected sauces and vegetable sides
Seared yellowfin tuna arrives on a bed of tangy Asian noodles in a soy broth; "crispy skin Atlantic cod" comes with polenta sticks and tapenade
Some dishes are somewhat stunted: A tequila-cured salmon appetizer, though tasty, is served in petite proportions
Based on reviews read online we decided to try this restaurant while in NYC to see the Color Purple
We made reservations on line got a comfirmation# by email, but when we arrived they couldn't find our reservation however, we were seated right away but the wait staff didn't seem to pleased
They were not rude they were just not friendly but we were determined that nothing would ruin our night out in NYC
We were not disappointed the food was very good and the desserts are incredible especially the double fudge brownie w/ vanilla gelato was excellent
My family and I had ate at Salomon River before a show for the holidays
It is in a great area of the city for shopping and seeing a showThe place is in salomon pink with tasteful pictures and plants, very cosy
You can also have a drink at the bar and starters in the waiting area
The food had a great presentation and the taste was different with each dish
The fish was cooked to perfection
The only dish that I wouldn't recommend was the salomon with potatoes
It was just as discribed a basic dish and you'll miss out on the chief talents of mixing asian flavors with his dishes
The dessert and prices were good
The sevice was ok, the manager was very nice and available for any needs you might have
We all are going back
Food- nothing to write to mom about
My daughetr's burger was good, the bacon needed to be crisper
The fries, excellent! The carafe of house Chardonnay, at $7
50 was an excellent value and quite tasty
My salmon was slightly overcooked, but not too dry
Overall it wasa good meal
but the service was mediocre
No one really seemed happy we dropprd in, just doing their jobs
One waiter and a ton of people to pour water and grind pepper
The host had to help him because as it got busier the service declined
The waterfall was pretty, but don't sit in front of it, it does splash
However, if you like the Zen Garden effect, go for it
Okay experience, but I would not go back
Too many restaurants in the city to do this one twice
Good luck if you venture
went here for dinner the other day
i had the yellowfin tuna w/asian noodles which was very good
the staff is nice, but they seem a bit confused
we saw orders going to wrong tables a couple times throughout the evening
i would recommend it for the food
I don't understand why some people are bashing this restaurant, for the past 3 years I had meals there at least 3 times a week because my office is around the corner, this is one of the best seafood restaurant in midtown, and for the money you don't find anyelse better
The service in this restaurant was unimpressive
On a weeknight in March, with only a few tables filled, our waiter was barely cordial
He seemed to be rushing us out as if it was closing time, but it was about 6:30
I guess he had something better to do
Food was okay, porbably wouldn't go back
A great midtown stop for lunch
business lunch or in-between window shopping
Very budget friendly with some of the freshest seafood at half the price (compare to The Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station)
Can get a little noisy some days at lunch
lots of businesses take clients here
but the waitstaff is very attentive, the ambience is more than decent

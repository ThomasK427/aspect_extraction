I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN ZIPI ZAPE
BUT AFTER TO SEE THIS NO SENSE REVIEW I WANTED TO MAKE COUPLE COMMENTS
IF THE FOOD IS SO BAD WHY LOTS OF SPANIARDS HANGING OUT HERE
MY EXPERIENCE WAS EXTRA ORDINARY
I AM HALF SPANISH HALF AMERICAN
TRIED LOMO , CAMARONES,TORTILLA, PATATAS,CHORIZO SPECIAL
WE REALLY ENJOYED IT
Does someone from CitySearch own this place or something? i see nothing but 'great review's for a place that really is not so great
better tapas than spain? where were you people eating before this? out of a garbage can? the food here is mediocre at best! extremely overprice for the microscopic portions you get
being from spain, i would so enthusiatically recommend this place
i wish someone had half a brain to notice the extreme similarities between all the previous reviews and realize that they were written by either the restaurant under different names or the owners family and friends
best tapas place in town
if you like seafood this is the place to go
very reasonable prices
excellent sangria
great service and more
must go place
we found this gem in Williamsburg
nicely done place,great value, simple , delicious food
good service
I've discovered this tapas bar last week
And tonight was my fourth visit there
I just can't get enough of this place
I am still trying to taste everything in the menu
Everyday they have new specials too
It is hard to keep up with them
these guys are serious and they definately know what are they doing
top notch food, service
excellent tapas,excellent service
best spanish tapas place so far I've been to
highly recommend it to anyone
and I think it is even better than the ones I've been in Spain
FINALLY WE MADE TO THIS TAPAS BAR

ZIPI ZAPE BECAME OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT INSTANTLY
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS SO CUTE , FUN , COLORFUL
THE FOOD IS EXTRA ORDINARY
This beautiful, europian tapas bar has so much to offer
Iwas there once with a big party
this time I decided to take my boy friend there
We let our host to choose the specials for us
so we tried black mediterrian mussels with white wine,monk fish liver pate,grilled fresh anchovies,dry cured tuna
The menu is also so big
I can't belive the chef is producing so much specials with great quality and price range
The service is very attentive and professional
oupps
I forgot about chocolate souffle
they told us they have customers take the trip from manhattan to have this heavenly dessert
No doubt after try the souffle , I will do the same thing
It was definately worth for a trip to Williamsburg
Such a cozy,fun tapas place
The menu was so colorful
We did not have reservation
Dining room was packed
But they did accomodate us at the bar
Even though bar was so buzy, our bartender took her time to explain their wonderfull specials
and suggested the dishes that we really enjoyed
grilled calamary,fresh anchovies
monk fish liver pate
this place has endless things to offer

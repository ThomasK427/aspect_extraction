It's wonderful to have rediscovered this gem
What a disappointment
Approaching Costa Azurra, my friends and I thought it a cute place to have some after-dinner drinks and dessert
Well, were we wrong
NOTHING went right
The waiter did not know what he was doing, was incredibly rude, brought us the wrong drinks, the wrong food, and we asked for everything about 3 times
The kicker was when (we were eating outside) he went around the corner and, in PLAIN VIEW of our table, started chatting on his cell phone for 10 minutes
Meanwhile, we were finished and jonesing for our check
We left a bad tip, and before we could get out of our seats, he snatched up the check and counted his tip in front of us
AVOID THIS RESTAURANT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Scene Owners Karen and David Waltuck continue to be trailblazers in their field
When they opened their doors in 1979, they were the first to bring fine food and smart, serious service to Tribeca
The scene, as well as the neighborhood, has evolved since then, and now a refined, moneyed clientele dines in the spacious, candlelit room rimmed with towering floral arrangements and sparkling chandeliers
Down-to-earth service tempers the formality
The Food David Waltuck's pricey, market-driven, prix-fixe dinner menu transcends trend with an assured blend of French inspiration and New American innovation
His timeless classics--like grilled seafood sausage bursting with butter, sweetness and brine; poached white tuna atop surpassingly fresh watercress coulis; and velvety-beyond-compare squab mousse--are understated and yet stunning
And when he layers more elaborate flavors--steamed lobster drizzled with curry-lime-muscat emulsion; gamey, wine-braised venison offset with sweet butternut squash flan--the results are beautifully calibrated
it is worth your money for the experience
great dishes, clean place and many years of existing make it a must try
The sommelier was very well versed with his wines
We ordered the tasting menu, which consisted with Fennel Marinated Salmon with Fennel Salad Vodka Lemon Sorbet
Personally
we found the sorbet too salty
It followed a Potato Ravioli with Two Truffle Sauces
The sauce was decadent, and hightened the taste of the ravioli
We found the highlight of the evening was the Crisp New Zealand Snapper with Ginger-Port Reduction
It was delightful
The lamb was acceptable - nothing to brag about
We were offered cheeses at the end of the evening
The waiter recited the list of cheeses, and we tried several varities
On the whole there were some great cheeses, but I wasn't fond of some varieties
The desserts were decadent
On the whole, the experience was enjoyable
The decor should reflect the fine quiality of its food
A la prochaine!
I decided that after I got engaged, I would take my fiance to the best place in town
I decided on Chanterelle based on the reviews and notoriety it had received over the years
When we arrived, we waited for 40 minutes and we were not even offered anything to drink
We had just gotten engaged, so no big deal, right? When we were finally seated, the service was extremely arrogant and unorganized
While the wine list was very impressive, the food was sub par and certainly not worth what might be the highest price dinner in NYC
The presentation was very blah, but I guess they arent into that type of thing given the sparse and grandma like dcor throughout restaurant
Bottom line is if you are looking for award winning French food in NYC, skip this place and go for one of the other big guys
Totally overated
I have revisited chanterelle after 3 years and found it to be running the same as when I last was there
Sure there are signs of its age visible, but I found the staff impeccable and the food well prepared, though nothing that wowd me
Very expensice wine list was a bit disappointing, I have purchased the same wine in other restaurants for almost a third of the price
Other than that it is a polished restaurant that shines on
great food!!!!! good service!!!!!!! best cheese display i scene, very quiet and lots a room at ur table
I can imagine the Chanterelle of days past was a force to be reckoned with
However, today's Chanterell is technically proficient and absolutely lacking in soul
For the ridiculus pricetag of $400 dinner for two
please buy a ticket to Paris
The service was slow and unnatentive
The food was just ok
For what they charge it's simply not worth it
Go somewhere else
Everything about Chanterelle is WONDERFUL!! Not only is the food superb and the decor GORGEOUS, but you can hear yourself think! And you can hear the people you're speaking to! It's gotten to the point where even at some 4 star restaurants, you're squeezed in,you can't hear anything at your table and you just wanna get out of there! Not at Chanterelle!! Exquisite!!
I dont get it! This place is awful
Every entree is covered in the same salty sauce
The food is way overpriced
The only thing that makes it at all worthwhile is the seafood sausage
Other then that I would say stay away you can fine much much better restaurants for much much cheaper prices in manhattan!
Chanterelle is my favorite special-occasion restaurant in New York
Yes, it is very expensive, and no, it is not a hipster atmosphere with loud music
In fact, there is no music here
It is a beautiful, sophisticated dining experience
The seafood sausage is to-die-for, the cheeses are superb, and the service is flawless
I've been four times and each time was just as special as the first
The restaurant is impressive
Massive bouquets of flowers on both sides of the room smelled amazing
Simple elegant decor
Great service
Beautiful presentation of the food
But the food itself is another story
The striped bass was dry
Both the appetizers and main courses had EXTREMELY heavy overwhelmingly-concentrated rich sauces made me sick the rest of the night
EWE
The bill was equally as nauseating
Classic food, classic decoration, ultra classic staff
Eating should be a feast ! Would be considered as old-fashioned in France but it's a very good value
No faux-pas at all
Good, but not impressive
The cheese plate is delicious, but just about anyone can buy good cheese anyway
The crawfish did not taste fresh, but the sauces were tasty
The service was quite attentive, but for the price, it was just ok really
I thoroughly enjoyed the entire dining experience at Chanterelle
We had the fixed dinner menu and the accompanying wine
Absolutely fantastic
Desert was pineapple soup---a delicious surprise! I highly recommend Chanterelle for special occasions or for impressing foodie friends!
Either way, you should make your way to this Tribeca gem
It will please you
It looks stuffy and really is, but the food is hands down some of the best in the world, the cheese tray is great and there space so you can hear yourself talk
Prices--high!!! But for that one occasion, try it out
Chanterelle is an amazing restaurant
I had the tasting menu and everything on it like ravioli with truffles, lamb with rosemary, grilled fish with caviar butter, and the heavenly desserts were all delicious
The atmopshere is nothing special and I felt like I was dining at a reception, but the service is very attentive and gracioius
Although my time here was nothing short of amazing, I prefer Daniel and would probably go back to Daniel for a special occassion
I felt that Chanterelle was less formal and didn't have as nice of an atmosphere
The food is comparable at both restaurants and I love them both
The food was nice, the space was nice, the service was nice and the meal was nice

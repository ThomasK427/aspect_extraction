The first time, I attempted to call them back and got only an answering machine (numerous times!)
The second time, I called, informed them that my food was missing, was told that they would deliver it within five minutes, and then had to call them again when this didn't happen
I finally got my appetizer, but without the bread it was supposed to come with
I suggest dining in the restaurant only
Considering there's an almost-as-good restaurant under the name Zaytoon in Dublin, there must be something about that name that brings tastiness to a restaurant
The food is never disappointing, with excellent chicken kabobs and falafel
The pitzas are a hightlight (I'm salivating right now thinking of them) and the pitas are the best of the five boroughs
The price
well, when I was broke, this was the only restaurant I went to
Excellent all around
Two broken thumbs up (this is Brooklyn, after all)
simple dishes cheap eat dispite the kitchen smell you have when you get out
They just keep improving; check out their weekend seafood entrees the Kabobs are a must
Very good falafel
The restaurant itself is fine for a quick meal, but best thing about Zaytoon's is that they deliver
This down-home restaurant serves the kind of great classic Italian food that you are looking for
This is the place to go to have a delicious meal for a great price
There are so many selections that you need to bring a friend to split two meals
Vinnie's has the most amazing selection of Italian comfort food I have ever seen
Is it good? Well lets put it this way, When they closed down for vacation, the neighborhood goes into withdrawel
I know people who order extra for the freezer just to hold them over
I think that is pretty good
Prices are excellent, with an average of about 10
00 Specials are a little more
After living here for five years and trying them all, they not only have the best pie in the hood, but one of the best in the city
Plus, they get a pie to my door faster than even the local big pizza franchise, even on SuperBowl Sunday
friendly staff best pizza in the neighborhood
the onion pie is delish
but the shrimp provencal with juicy tomatoes is absolute heaven! the chicken parm rolls aren't bad either
If you live in Carroll Gardens, there's no reason to
Vinny's has definitely got some of the best take-out and delivery anywhere, anytime
The pizzas are to die for, but the same can be said for their heroes, pastas, and calzones
I have used them many many times for parties, and they never disappoint
Terrific, hearty homestyle Italian chow
Not a place to sit down and eat, though
The absolute BEST pizza in NY and I've been to a lot of pizza places
great spot
the pizza tastes good
beer too
you're sitting outside under the grapes
they invite you in with a smile and ask you to make yourself at home
BUT if you get there late, (they close at 10 on sundays) they will literally kick you out
suddenly demanded payment so they could close, while other families were still eating
we paid up, and he said thanks, went back inside and turned the lights out on us (10:05pm), and the other guests, then glared at us through the window while we finished our drinks and packed up in the dark
it definitely spoiled the experience, we were excited to eat there (1st time), and they seemed so nice
He smugly told us he'd love to have us back
I don't think so
My girlfriend was embarassed, and i was infuriated
that's not what i consider good service
Leonardo's ham pizza is one of the best pies around
The sauce is fresh and delicious, and the crust is perfectly crisp
It just can't be beat!
Leonardo's is by far the BEST pizza in Brooklyn
Forget all the joints with the lines and hype, just head to Carroll Gardens and have a glass of wine and a crispy pie
The friendly staff is always welcoming, and everytime you walk into the place, you feel like you're home
Thin crust
Very thin! Well made! Incredible! You must try it! You will be back for sure
Amazingly nice in summer when the patio is open too
Small pie is for one person basically so order a lot in order to get filled up!
I have to say, I was pleasently suprised by the crisp and thin crust, the tangy sauce and the milky (sp?) fresh mozarella that the pie was comprised of
However, the owner berated the pizza man for forgetting our mushrooms which was, well, meanspirited
If Leo got his temper under control I'd be back in a heartbeat for a piece of that pie
Yum!!
The Scene Run by the Caltado family since 1968, and renovated in 2005, this restaurant and pizzeria is a neighborhood favorite
A checkerboard floor and glass, lantern-style lamps set a family-friendly tone
Half the restaurant is devoted to a takeout, with a traditional pizza counter and sidewalk window, while the other half offers waiter service
Pizza toppings stick to the basics--you won't find any pancetta here--but entrees offer a few surprises like stuffed roast pork and an extensive seafood menu
This place is a neigborhood tradition
Born and raised in the area and currently living in Arizona, the first eatery I visit on my return trips is NINO'S! Their pizza is 2 nd to NONE! Also, ANYTHING on the menu is excellent
For all those coming from out of town, or, for those new to the area
make Nino's a MUST ATTEND! Also, K-10 LOVES the rice balls
This is the best Pizza place ever
I eat the eggplant parmesan hero every week
When I get married I am going to have a Nino's Eggplant parmesan hero at my wedding
Mola
Mola
Just say the word real slow and you'll convince yourself not to go there
The pizza tastes really bad and the service tatses worse
When we want a regular pizza, out of many pizzarias in the neighborhood, we always order from Mola pizza
We tried them all
The guy who answers the phone sounds like Marlon Brando
The no-nosense, fancy-free pizza has been consistently tasty
(Order it well-done
) I like their calamari, too
In Short Many diners seem to prefer breakfast, often stretching well past the bounds of lunch, at this quaint Carroll Gardens cafe
Choices are standard and plentiful: omelettes and egg dishes, pancakes, bagels, muffins, croissants, mini-doughnuts, cookies, etc
Salads, 18 panini options and burgers from the grill round out the menu
The interior is small and clean, with limited seating
The outdoor garden more than doubles the dining space and is tented in winter
We went recently for brunch, on a very hot and humid day
Although we did have to wait a few minutes, and no one working there seemed to be organized in terms of a wait list, it was all worth it
The garden is beautiful and peaceful, it was so refreshing given the weather
I didn't want to leave! The food was delicious
I agree that the wait staff wasn't very friendly, but the service was adequate and our food arrived without too much of a wait
I'm looking forward to going back
the service that is
the waitress gives you dirty looks if you ask if you can sit down since there is never anyone there greet you or make eye contact with
Today i tried (again) to get delivery but their first number listed on their to go menu is STILL busy as i write this (it's been 2 hours and 15 min) their second number just keeps on ringing
I have to admit that their decor and ambience is above par compared to other cafes in the area but if the owner only puts time and effort into the aesthetics and not in the service then maybe he should be an interior decorator and not in the SERVICE industry
I must say

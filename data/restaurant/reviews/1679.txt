In Short Hanover Square's majestic, painstakingly restored India House is the setting for Bayard's
Decor includes mahogany floors, brass finishings, elaborate ceiling moldings, antique chandeliers, a working fireplace and maritime artifacts
Former Lutece chef Eberhard Muller came aboard as executive chef in 2001; the menu includes dishes like foie gras and black truffles in savoy cabbage, venison loin with a poached pear and herbed spaetzle and rack of lamb with a honey-mustard glaze
I've eaten at Bayard's a few times, and have always been impressed by the quality and presentation of the food, the just-the-right-amount of attentiveness of the waitstaff, and the general ambience
The space itself is beautiful
So I recently chose it as the site for a private party, and let me just say
WOW
The food was fantastic as always
Everyone from the manager down to the waitstaff passing hors d'oeuvres were unfailingly professional, friendly, and helpful beyond the call of duty
I would recommend Bayard's not only to anyone looking for a high-end dining experience, but also to anyone looking for a place to host a party
I can't say enough good things about it!
Bayards is unquestionably the best restaurant in New York at this time
Fresh ingredients, wonderful combinations of tastes, fantastic atmosphere, great wine list, reasonably priced when compared with other top restaurants
Eberhardt Muhler is a true artist who doesn't hide behind complex sauces and overpowering seasoning
Every dish is a true masterpiece
Bayard's provides a truly amazing dining experience
Everything from the food to the decor to the impeccable service is well worth the trip downtown
The wine list is also very impressive
The restaurant is set in a beautiful, historical building; once you walk in you'll feel like you're not in New York anymore! If you get the chance, check out the magnificent art that surrounds the walls!
I can only say that our Bayard's experience was nothing like the review posted on 12/14
All I have to say is that the service food are highly overated and not worth the price
There are much better restaurants in this price range in NYC
It may be a little tricky to find Bayard's, but once you step inside, magic happens
You enter a fabulous mansion filled with antiques, Asian and maritime art
Each floor is worth exploring
We started with a lavender martini at the plush Blue Bar
Then up to the gorgeous dining room, where the fire was roaring
We were in bliss
Then came the food, each dish more succculent than the next
The duck foie gras and oxtail terrine takes you right to Heaven, and the celery root soup was so sophisticated
The braised veal shank was outstanding, and so was the roasted codfish
The chef, Eberhard Muller, owns an organic farm with his wife
No wonder the vegetables were so delicious
Keep room for dessert, because they are all winners
The wine list is huge, and the service was impeccable
Everyone should go to Bayard's, it is an unforgettable experience
We went to Bayard's last night for the prixe fix dinner
You'd think they would try and dazzle patrons so we'd be inspired to come back for the full menu
Not so
We had to ask for our bread, the soup was luke warm, we had to ask for a wine menu twice and the salmon was cold and tasteless
When asked why our martinis were watery, we were told they were having a problem with their ice
We were told when we called the dress code was no sneakers and no jeans, well the people behind us were in sneakers, jeans and t-shirts
Also, we were seated 40 minutes after our reservation
The prixe fix menu was a deal to boost downtown restaurants, atleast we didn't pay the full price
This restaurant is an experience everyone should enjoy
From the wait staff to the food to the ambiance, it was a true fine dining experience
Dont wait for a special occasion, just go
Expensive, but worth it
Their Tuna Tartar is flawless
Dover Sole was impeccable
Mashed potatoes and fries were even great
Cool nautical museum setting too
Highly recommend it
My coworkers and I like to come to this place for lunch
Great value, pretty good food
The decor isn't anything special, but that's not what you're coming for
In and out quickly
Horrible
Overpriced (paid $30+ for a tasteless piece of striped bass) and bad service
The restaurant is located downstairs and the place was damp and smelled of the bathroom
I have been to Joseph's twice it is a hidden gem
Food is great plentiful
Would highly recommend as a romantic getaway or a place to bring clients
This was my second visit to Joseph's and I was very pleased
The first time I was here was just before Christmas
They were packed and the food was just mediocre
But this time was different
We had a variety of appetisers and entrees including veal, chicken and fish
Every dish was very good to excellent
The service was excellent without be overbearing
Good wine list, too
I'll definetely be back!
I'm a regular at ToT
Is it the best Sushi in the world? No
But it is good sushi, that is consistently fresh and well prepared? Yes
Lunch time is packed and its best to call ahead for a table
Their take out all gets delivered by one guy on a bike
So much of sushi's flavor comes from how fresh it is
A delivery that sits around is not going to taste the greatest
Their stuff is best eaten there
Most of the food is ready for take-out or to eat at one of the tables
It seemed very fresh and there was a large choice
One problem: I ordered black coffee (I am allergic to milk) and repeated my order
What I got was coffee WITH milk when I complained I was told that was what I had ordered! Finally I got black coffee!
but they will leave you quite unpleasant to sit next to a few hours later
good food, but not the best for you
I'd recommend the number 7 special, with french fries in the paninni
While NYC has some of the greatest pizza places around, it also has some of the nastiest
This place is convienient and very tasty
I like the variety and the fact that I can always find a seat
Check it out
Huge portions cooked to perfections
Very friendly service
Very nice old wood setting
I've been here twice, loved it both times
Amazing food, great bar scene! And there's another one in the Bronx
The steak was very good, but the location and ambience do not justify the uptown prices
We went on a quite night so waiter gave us his full attention
Steak was great but side dishes and everything else was nothing special
The waiter was trying to be funny but there is no polite way of telling the customer to shut up

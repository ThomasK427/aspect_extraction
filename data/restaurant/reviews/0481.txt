What a great store! Yummy Hot chocolate and kick-ass tea
The place was packed with people but we ordered and got our goodies without delay
We retreated to the back where they've set up a cute 1950's kitchen and we spent what seemed like hours tasting a ton of candy
I like a place thats not too hip and when I was there I saw a lot of different kind of people
When I entered Chocolate Bar I could not believe how LITTLE chocolate there was
just some stale-looking cookies, brownies and biscotti
There was one measly display case of chocolate, but with flavors like green tea and grapefruit I was completely repelled
So, I decided to order a hot chocolate, but what I got was luke warm chocolate water
What is this place thinking? Such a great concept, too bad they have absolutely no idea what they're doing
Upon visiting Chocolate Bar for the first time I instantly realized what made the place so wonderful
great chocolates, wonderful service, and comfortable atmosphere
Not at all stuffy with friendly knowledgeable staff
The mexican brownies were out of this world
I give it four stars
I went to the chocolate bar launch party and let me tell you, there's nothing better than free chocolate
After eating so many free samples of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies I had to go to the store and buy a box
Fresh and gooey just like the commercials
With Father's day upon us, I know exactly what I'm getting dear old Dad
Come hungry: big portions, many courses, stage performances, dancing---we stayed 5 hrs
Despite that the place was packed on two floors (with several 30+ parties at once), the kitchen put out well-timed, good, and carefully prepared dishes (we were only a 6-top and new to the place but made to feel like regulars)
Similar floor-starved places in Brooklyn need to install you tightly---Peter the Great is spacious with plenty of room to circulate making it GREAT for children
The performers were superb (we were there on a Saturday night)
Cold Antipasto - meat tasted disgusting and looked like it was 5 years old
Clams casino bread crumbs on a clam no distinctive taste
Ordered chicken was given veal
I would never have or attend an affair at this place again
In Short Pick a Bagel's decor is cafeteria-like, with a drop ceiling, fluorescent lighting and faux-wood tables
A small, friendly team of attendants fields orders from a steady stream of local office workers
The huge bagels' fluffy, chewy interiors are marked by occasional large bubbles
Accoutrements consist of the usual assortment of spreads, salads and smoked fish
The eatery also doles out reliable soups, salads and wraps
I LOVE their lowfat EGG-WHITE SALAD and everything bagel
This no-frills locale is perfect for breakfast or lunch
Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for
This isn't a value joint
While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city
It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for
Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
Pick a bagel on 2nd has the best chicken salad ever
even there low fat is good
The employees are excellent
some even know me by name and order (pathetic for me)
i just can't stay away! plus the make your own salad
they do not have limits on what or how much you can put on it
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests! I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere! Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!
the turkey burgers are scary!
absolutely heavenly bagels - the pumpernickel is DIVINE! atmosphere is not that great but you're only there for the food anyway
These are the best bagels I ever had
Their big and delicious
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city
big and soft as well as good lunch food
They outshine HH
I am from Brooklyn so i know bagels and these bagels are great
I have been trying to cut down on carbs but these bagels are worth every little carb they have in them
They never skimp on the lox
Excellent low fat cream cheese, but stay away from the fat free!
Great food and service is top notch!! I've had dinner there(great), and my shower was held there
They do a great job on catering in the restaurant
Great food, great drinks, nice dining atmosphere
The bar scene here can be a bit annoying, since out-of-towners crowd into Hoboken, making it almost impossible for residents to enjoy the better local establishments
But dinner here is never disappointing, even if the prices are a bit over the top
Try the fried oysters a Cosmopolitan
Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu
If you like Indian food you are in for a treat
The food here was great, a treat from beginning to end
Good food at the right price, what more can you ask for
Indian food is just not flavored with curry
Karma KAFE packs the heat with their melange of spices that give their grilled meats a tangy bite
Be it beef or chicken, the warm nan bread, biryani rice and salad with the delectable white sauce, it's a pleasure dome of good eats
The cozy and broody ambiance gives this place a great Karmic vibe!
My bf and I went tonight and loved it! The service was awesome, the restaurant small and cozy
We felt like we were in someone's home
It is BYOB and they made Sangria for us which was really good
We asked the waiter to suggest dishes and he was spot on
The quesidilla much better and different than what one normally finds
The chicken was tender
The shrimp with mola sauce and kale was tasty
The tostonis crispy and not oily with a garlic sauce
The food was well portioned and there was a huge selection
Even the bread they gave us was toasted, warm and buttery
I've been there once before, food is decent, service and ambience is poor
This time I had a party of 8 people and I made a reservation 4 days in advance and even gave them my phone number
Showed up on a hot weekend night, the whole restaurant is full for one party who reserved for 20 and showed up with 35
The owner and matre-d said that we could either sit outside (90 degrees and 100% humidity) or we could go somewhere else! No Apology, No i'm sorry and I had even given them my phone number to call if they had a problem
Becuase of their complete lack of sympathy I will never eat at this place or Chucaramamma (they own both) again
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere

The pistacchio gelato was great
Service was slow and inattentive
Had to flag someone over to give our wine order
Utensils were not replaced between courses
No napkin when we were seated, went unnoticed and I had to ask for one
For a $100 tab I was not full when I left and could have gone for another meal
Pasta and rice are not expensive, come on guys give us a break!!!!
We went to this place for sunday bruch
The food was good - but not sure whether it was worth waiting more than 30min
We waited in standing at the entrance for 5 mins to get seats due to just slow service, another 10mins to get menu, and then another 10mins to get water bread
Then, finally our dishes!!! yes, it was very long-waiting brunch
The friendly waitress made it up by offering us a fab peach dessert
Funny, An intalian guy (believe he is the manager) came to our table VERY QUICKLY to get our check!
We had the WORST brunch experience at Gusto! It took 1 hour to get our entrees
one of which was warmed-up meatballs from the day before
Service was almost non-existent
The only decent thing was the decor
trendy and cozy
I will NEVER go there again
not even if they were giving out free meals
Gusto is like a breath of fresh air in the neighborhood, a cool sexy place with a great vibe
The food is fantastic- simple yet great flavors
Far superior to other Italian restaurants in the area
The fried artichokes, fava salad and octopus are excellent, as are the pastas
Too many places can't seem to do a whole fish but Gusto can
A couple of hiccups with service but the staff is really gracious
If you can't get a table- try lunch
Or sit in a tall stool at the bar and have a great martini
It's comfortable enough for a meal and you get a great view of the room
Highly recommended
My meal at Gusto this past Friday night surpassed even the high expectations set by my dining companion, who had raved over his past experiences at this Greenwich Avenue charmer
I was immediately impressed by the warmly lit, elegantly furnished space; although there was a slight wait for our reserved table--the place was jam-packed--the charming host, Alexi, was courteous and apologetic
The ensuing dinner was definitely worth the wait; I'll be dreaming about chef Jodi Williams' extraordinary fried squash blossoms for a long time
The lamb chops were the sweetest, most succulent that I have had in recent memory; and roasted peaches in wine finished our feast off in a simple, elegant, delicious fashion
Our sweet, fresh-from-Italy server was friendly and efficient
An amazing find on a block littered with faceless, undistinguished eateries, Gusto immediately has become my favorite Village destination
went for brunch on saturday
Server mentioned there were several bloody marys so I asked for a list
waited 10 minutes
Finally,flagged down another server and asked again for the list
He nodded as if he understood, but after a few more minutes ANOTHER employee approached the table and said, you asked for something?
I would have given up if not for the fact that by this time, I really NEEDED a drink
The guy went away and returned not with a drink menu, but the bartender's recipe instruction card
The food? ugh
I ordered the nizzard salad (nicoise basically) which for $14 was tiny and miserable: the tuna was so overcooked and dry as to be unrecognizable and frankly inedible
My husband's steak and eggs which arrived 15 minutes after I was served, were worse than those at the corner diner and about $15 more expensive
Had such an amazing evening the other night at Taku
We sat in the garden which is a peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Smith Street
Had great appatizers; fried tofu with ponzu sauce, spicy chicken wings, delicious sesame shrimp and tuna hand rolls
For mains we soft shell crabs, angus steak, taku ramen, ( to die for) and shiromi ponsu all were really flavorful
The service was friendly and efficient
My only complaint is i ate too much!!!!
I was really disappointed with this place
The tuna tartare was, well, entirely cooked
The vegan spring rolls were one of the greasiest things I have ever had the misfortune of eating (like a $1 vegetable roll from a flourescent, all-night Chinese restaurant)
The sesame crusted shrimp were bland (and left serious grease stains on the napkin they were arranged on) but ok with the dipping sauce--perhaps a bit overpriced at $12 for 5 shrimp
The shitake udon that comes with the chicken yakitori was the best thing
And the drinks are tasty and creative
$90 for two drinks and a few appetizer-sized plates
Overall though I wouldn't repeat the experience
Excellent food! Not a place you can go everyday, but definitely worth a try for a special occasion
I just have to say that the whole rest
is amazing
The food, the service and the walls are painted by an amazing artist
You have to eat the wings, the tuna tartare, tofu fries and especially the ramen soup
I live up the block and I love noodle soups, but this Ramen soup is the absolute best soup i have ever had
They also do take out so you can get your noodles on the go!  Enjoy! I did!
Amazing food, wonderful service, and a great atmosphere
Highly recommended
Be sure to get the spicy tuna hand rolls! Wonderful
IT may be a little pricey to frequent everyday, but try it once you'll understand why
The food is fresh the noodles are outstanding
I didn't expect to find this type of restaurant in Brooklyn have now been there 4 times
Most 1st timers have the pad thai, which is very good, but try one of their unique noodles for an interesting taste experience
I have tried this place several times, and would put the cuisine against anything in Brooklyn and a lot of Manahttan
Service is friendly, the room is pleasant, and the food is absolutely delicious
Not to mention a very eclectic and interesting sake list
The prices are a little higher that a lot of the other offerings on the street, but the produce is top quality and the proteins are often free range and organic
If you haven't been there, you need to check it out!
Taku is the most creative menu I have seen in quite some time
The food is fresh, all sustainable product, and I have to give it to the three guys in the kitchen who put out some of the most beautiful food I have ever seen
Their ramen is not to be missed, last time I sat next to some business men from Japan who were blown away and said that it was the best ramen that they had ever had! Also, don't miss the black cod or the scallops! A great space in Brooklyn, and worth the hike from the UES any day!
Saw that a new restaurant opened up and decided to try it on a Saturday night
There was only one table of 10 and two other tables of 2 so figured there'd be no wait because 75% of the restaurant was empty
Wrong
We were told by the hostess, who we had to seek out, that we had to wait 10 minutes because they need to stagger seating cause the kitchen can't handle the capacity
Bear in mind 3/4 of the restaurant was EMPTY! Needless to say we weren't too happy and were rather surprised that we would have to wait in an empty restaurant for a table
The bar area was nice with several people seemingly enjoying their time and the decor was simple and appealing, but until I see that they have either hired people who aren't dits or expand their kitchen I won't return
We came in on a fairly quiet Sunday, and were greeted with warm, knowledgable service
The server explained the sake list, which was a great value, and the sake she chose was perfect
Appetizers were amazing, entrees hearty, setting (garden) was tranquil and beautiful
Definitely worth checking out
This was one of those restaurants that seems to almost be there - but just missing it's target
Nothing spectacular
Pleasant space, although it was very loud when we were there due to one noisy table in an otherwise almost empty restaurant (put something on the walls?) - didn't jibe with their peaceful looking decor/design
Our dishes and apps were nice - but sort of generally bland
I thought the portions were uneven (one of our entrees was plenty, while another one was quite small for the same price)
We expected a place with some sushi and other typical Japanese fare
What we found was an unexpected menu of delicious choices! The place has great seating, and even a bar-seating area in the back so you can watch the chefs cook (which we love)
And everyone is so nice, feels like a small neighborhoody place you can't find too much in Manhattan anymore

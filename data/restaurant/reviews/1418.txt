It was COLD
Unlike the other customer, we weren't even offered a complimentary tea! The total price for the everything came out to $80
00
too pricey for sushi!  We left Sushi twist with empty stomachs and disappointed
OK
The Sushi was good, but you pay $15 for a roll that cost $8-$10 anywhere else
I went there with my girlfriend tonight
The place only has about 12-15 tables, but only 3 were occupied when we arrived (7:45 Friday Night) Our waiter was a complete useless waste of space
My first impression was why is there some swedish guy taking my order at a sushi place The apps and sushi came out very quickly (about 15 minutes for both) The problems arose after the main course, when we decided to stay for dessert
We sat there and waited and waited and waited for our creme brulee and icecream
And in the 40 minutes of waiting for dessert the waiter couldnt be bothered to even offer to refill our water
Finally after a few glances from my girlfriend the waiter finally comes over apologizes for the wait and offers us some green tea
I almost choked when he said this is on me Are you kidding? 40 minute wait, horrible service and youre offering me a free cup of tea thats costs all of 0
25? The creme brulee finally arrives, but no icecream
So we both start into the creme bruless and realize they forgot to put sugar on top
Burnt milk is all I could taste
At that point I asked for the check, told them the creme brulee was awful
The brought the check, I signed the credit card bill
and then the icecream arrived
All I can say is go somewhere else, you'll get the same food at a better price with much better service and atmosphere
I cant say I will ever be eating at Sush Twist ever again
Had a great time at dinner last night
The owners are so adorable! Wanted to write to say how my friends and I loved the place, and say hi to the owners who were so friendly and cute (
hi!!) A rare find
Not a HUGE fan of sushi, but need to lost wieght, decided to try- must say, I loved the rolls there
Thought $15 for a tokyo triangle roll was expensive, but when it came out, the one roll was hard for me to finish! It was at least 10 pieces! AND, it was in the shape of a triangle, very fun!! Good for my wallet, and my stomach!
I was looking for a great sushi place, and my friend recommended the TWIST
Few of my friends and I had wonderful experience here
delicious food, nice people, warm environment
I loved their twist special martini, and sushi was superb!! fulfilled my passion for sushi~
if you are in new york area, and want to have some fresh sushi, I strongly recommend the SUSHI TWIST
my friend and I was passing by and went in for quick bite, but if we had more time and bigger stomach, we would happy to try all the other special rolls
rolls were soooooooo delicious
For someone who is always taking out clients to lunch for meetings, I've found it hard to find a quiet, trendy place with good food
However, I've found that time and time again, Sushi Twist has been a perfect place for business lunches
The owner even remembers my name, making me feel important everytime i go in (beneficials for my meetings)
The sushi rolls are truly one of a kind
Love it there, sure others will too
After waiting over an hour at another restaurant (with reservations), fed up, we decided to try Sushi Twist
We didn't have reservations, and it was 8 of us
Though it was pretty busy, they did their best and sat us down in less than 10 minutes
The staff was very welcoming, so we asked her to pick a few of her favorite rolls for us all the share
We all agree that the food was phenomenal
We all shared the Twist Salad, big enough for a meal, and the Explosion Roll was my favorite
They even surprised us all with dessert
Food, with the service, with the Twist cocktails made my birthday memorable!
i went to 20 sushi places while i was in ny for vaca and this place had by far, the best value
fresh fish, huge selection of hot entrees for those that dont eat sushi- and LOTS of rolls and appetizers for sushi lovers
if you like spicy raw fish try the buddy roll- if you dont eat raw try the salmon served over rice in the stone pot- dont know what its called
amazing amazing amazing
and of course, try the home made ice cream
I rarely write any recommendation about restaurants but i felt like i owed it to the public to comment on how delicious my meal was at sushi twist
Seriously if your down to having a japanese fusion style meal in a cozy trendy atmosphere sushi twist it the place to be
I had the roasted king crab legs and dang simply hit the taste buds in all the right places
Hey seriously check this place out highly recommend it
I was always freaked out about sushi but my boyfriend insisted we go to this place where he always goes for his lunch break
I was hesitant to try any of the raw stuff but there was quite a selection of cooked item and very appetizing roles that was made up of mostly vegetables and stuff
All in all i had a great meal and the servers were very informative about the food that i was trying
After walked for hours, stopped in with a friend, and went in just for a drink, but stayed for a whole meal
The cocktails were great, and not too expensive, and the food was delicious! Salmon and tuna was really fresh
Next time, seeking it out to go again!
two blocks away from my work, its my favorite place to go to escape from work
the food is great, but the treatment i get from servers and the owner is what keeps me coming back
they remember my name, and truly make me feel like VIP
highly recommended
Sushi Twist is easily one of best restaurants in the city
Their sushi is very fresh, innovative and delicous
I had the Twist Salad, which was great, a large portion that could be a meal itself
The sashimi on the twist salad was fresh and the dressing was really great
We had the Peacock Roll, which is the best sushi roll I have ever eaten
The Volcano Roll was good too, it sounded so odd so we had to try it
Sushi with Mozzerella cheese melted on top
Sounds weird but very good
I can not recommend any restaurant anymore than Sushi Twist
took a friend out to dinner for her bday recently and it was great
we had: miso soup, green salads (yummy dressing), vegetable dumplings (tasty), shrimp tempura roll (awesome), volcano roll - cali roll topped w/ chopped crab, masago, and melted mozzarella cheese (a little weird for me but my friend liked it), and the beef teriyaki (best dish of the night!)
bc the location of this place is in a dead area on Madison ave, its never really crowded so I love it bc we never have to wait
Im a regular :)
went there 3 nights ago, and my mouth is still watering thinking of the CHICKEN TERIYAKI
i don't usually eat sushi, so i ordered the chicken teriyaki
my friends called be boring! well, not a real connoisseur my butt, they were picking from my plate the whole night
the chicken was so tender and juicy
never had chicken teriyaki that tasted to good! my friends had sushi
and they loved it too, but did i mention how good the chicken teriyaki was?
100% unique sushi- wasnt my first time there but i tried the firecraker roll for the frist time
this is definitely my new favorite spot
and the veg dumpling soup, tastes like somethign my mother would make for me im never having california rolls again
My new favorite restaurant! Had a wonderful time
I love it
this place is madison ave's saving grace
the area needed a great local spot and this is it
great food, relaxing atmosphere, friendly people
between 4 people, we had 8 of the Special Rolls and some apps, and we could not have been happier
my favorite was the explosion- something like shrimp tempura and spicy tuna combined
heavenly!!
I am a huge sushi lover and this is the first time I ever had sushi rolls with mozzerella cheese on my rolls, and it was mmmmmmmmm
delish! The sushi was so fresh and flavorfull and tasty! I am definately heading back!
the staff here is the nicest ive seen in manhattan
i just went in for a drink but i just had the absolute best time
the bartender was so sweet and friendly and the owner was adorable

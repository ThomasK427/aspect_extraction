Overall, good food and service at a more than fair price
The food in this place is amazing
The flavors are perfectly complementary
The dishes are fantastic
Love devils on horseback,the gravlox/beet salad is magic
As are the duck and the fish dish served with the best carrots I have ever had
If your ready to sit down for dinner and be amazed by the food
Then come here and bring an incredible bottle of wine to accompany the exceptional food
Everything I've had here is terrific
Feta and sundried tomato app is awesome as is the spinach, gorgonzola, and bacon salad
Service is good, food is very flavorful, and it's a great addition to the neighborhood
Highly recommend
I've gone to Lamb and Jaffy several times now, and every time the food has been excellent
The lamb and the duck (when they have it) are tender and packed with flavor, the appetizers are especially good, and the atmosphere is quiet and cozy
Service was nice too, attentive but relaxed
I haven't had a chance to try the desserts yet, because I'm always too full
My one qualm is that they dont have a liquor license, and the liquor store next door has an awful selection, so get your bottle before you go
look, I don't really want a ton of bridge and tunnel manhattan kids coming over to my neighborhood and making it hard for me to get a table at the Lamb Jaffy, but I really must say that the other review is nonsense
the food is amazing
nothing overly chic or pretentious
start with the devils on horseback, dates wrapped in bacon that come in the cast iron pan they were fried in
the tilapia in brown butter is a personal favorite
no fancy presentation, yeah
but the lamb jaffy is certainly a gem
perhaps the best thing in the neighborbood (after photoplay, of course)
I was so excited when this restaurant opened; this specific area needs a good restaurant on Manhattan Ave
But, after THREE tries-once for brunch TWICE for dinner, I have given up hope
Brunch: coffee cold had to be sent back (!!??!), eggs benedict with lump crabmeat/hollandaise sauce on artichoke hearts were also cold, eggs hardly cooked and oozing with clear egg goo-articokes as hard as a rock
Dinner was recently a lamb special - large gristly hunks of lamb slopped on plate, swimming in a pool of watery sauce with chopped asparagus thrown all over plate
It was just bad
Another time: Pork medallions w potatoes apples - only just edible but boring/ uninteresting
My husband didnt like the food each time either
I'm not high maintenance, just wish for good food
and they could do SO well there-but they just dont have it down right
FOOD was Cold
like brick ice how ever the service was fast because not a lot of people were there
Great menu, especially the dedication of dishes to past political figures
The best Chicken Tikka Masala in the city, and be sure to try the Indian street snacks
The desserts could use some work, and the decor is a bit boring, but the food is so good!
I decided to go to Rangole after reading a good review on the new york times
This is a great place if you are looking for some variety in indian dishes
Being an Indian I am lot more critical and completely bored of the same menus in every restaurant
The chaats are amazing
I would higly recommend the bhelpuri -- It is as good as a chaat on bombay streets
Also try the different dosas on the menu, specially the pondicherry dosa if u like spicy food
The prices are reasonable
I've already been there thrice in the last 2 weeks!
Delivery portions are bigger and 2 can easily share 1 entree
Lunch Buffet is still the same@ 7
95 and for the spread that is really a great price
This used to be a real bargain for lunch, but they just raised the lunch special prices by $2
50 and are attempting to justify this by now including a soda
The food is still pretty good, but now that it's no longer much of a deal, there's no really compelling reason to go there over any of the other places in the area that are priced about the same
the buffet lunch is a good deal
we waited over 30 minutes to be seated, the line was out the door
the food was worth the wait
This great new restuarant puts a new European spin on the indian food
THe food is amazing
Yes, they have the basic indian dishes, but they have a huge assortment of other dishes, not well known to the American palate
THe Owner makes great suggestions of new dishes to try, even to an Indian food expert, I was surprised by the great surprises
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a excellent indian meal
the prices don't necessarily scream casual, but this is a great place to get fantastic gourmet soba in a relaxed dining environment
the broths are amazing, the prawns just right, the sake selection excellent
IT WAS THE BEST SOBA I HAVE EVER EATEN IN NYC!!
DELICIOUS 2 for 1 martinis made with fresh fruit puree - SO good!!
Pazza Notte is attractive and comfortable, with a large, mostly-good menu
I like the hot sandwiches and fries, as well as the pizzas
But even better, I enjoy the lively, funky atmosphere and drinks
They have an extremely well-stocked bar and skilled bartenders
I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun place to go after work in midtown (which can be hard to find), or even for lunch on a weekend
Sit in the back for quiet and privacy, in the front for people-watching
My family and I went to dinner there on Christmas night and had a great experience
The staff was attentive and the food was great
I will return for more of the same
Enjoyed the ambience, it was friendly which is great for a casual affair, but nothing to serious
Great food, perfect martinis, beautiful and friendly staff, good prices, and a good view of the street
One of the best meals we had in NYC
After the hype I expected somewhere at least as good as many of the great American restaurants I have visited recently - BLT, BLT Prime, Daniel Boulud, Homestead for example
This was really poor though
The appetisers were unimaginative and flavorless (shrimp cocktail and Lobster bisque were anyway)
The rib-eye steak (asked for medium rare), was dry and the most over-salted food I have ever been served (I couldn't finish it)
No sauces or anything available with the steaks
At $44 for a medium sized steak I would have expected better, but maybe they expect you to pay for the $160 Kobe / Wagyu beef
The vegetables however were unseasoned, and tasteless
Service off-hand at best
Atmosphere not that great - bit cavernous with pretty stark lighting, and was less than half full at 8pm on a Saturday night
With the dining room only a third full, it seemed unreasonable to wait 40 minutes for our 2 simple brunch dishes to arrive, especially when I discovered that the chickpea pancakes smoked salmon dish was smaller than appetizer-size; they're quite bold to list it on the menu as a full dish
Server was nonexistent; when we flagged her down, she told us that the food was 'being plated' when clearly they were just starting to prepare it
So many other worthwhile brunch places around; skip this one
Bad food, bad service
Everyone at the table (four of us) ordered different things and no one liked what they ate
Our waiter did not come back once to reserve our wine
Eat elsewhere
our group of 4 came for a late dinner before a night of partying
we started off with the fried sausage-stuffed sage leaves ($8) the warm pecorino fondue (w/honey hazelnuts, $9)
the leaves were slightly spicy lightly breaded very tasty
the fondue was too oily for my tastes, but it had a savory/sweet taste combo that was quite appealing
after our appetizers, we had to wait almost an hour for our main courses to arrive
this is enough to make me not want to come again
i had the sauteed skate ($18) which was quite tasty seasoned and then rubbed with brown butter to make it crispy

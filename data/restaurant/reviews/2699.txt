My advice is: if you really want to go there, just go there for a drink at the bar
The food is awful especially at that price
Also, the place is very noisy
This a very romantic place to invite that date that you want to seduce
nice coffee and very cute guys
Very romantic
It has a beautiful view of the city
Their food its amazing
it is expensive but I would say it is totally worth it
I took my girlfriend here yesterday, had an incredible time, thanks to the host who lived up to his promise, very surprising since the place was packed
Anyway the food was really good, the portions are not big however very filling and exceptionally good
The place possesses romantic atmosphere with dim lighting, and one of a kind New York City view
The service lives up to it's class, very professional and thorough
The place outside us well us inside absolutely beautiful especially during the night
Defiantly a place to take someone you want to impress, you want regret it
My girlfriend and I had an incredible night that we will never forget
Thank you River Cafe keep up the good work!
The best words to describe this place are stunning, romatic, luxurious, trendy and fabulous
White glove service - delectable view of the skyline, scrumptous food, fabulous presentation
and did I already mention the view?  I held my reception at the River Cafe a little over a year ago and since then revisited RC for our first year anniversary
Whether supper, lunch or wedding - I have always been 100% completely satisfied
I am sure you will not be able to find flaw with the ambiance, decor, service, menu or presentation
Tres Tres Chic
Trust me - you will fall in love with the garden, the view of the ocean and the majesty of the Brooklyn Bridge (at the River Cafe, they are all at your fingertips)!!! ;-)
My husband surprised me when he took me here! We were just gonna grab a bite to eat and the next thing i knew we were driving over the brooklyn bridge into Brooklyn and sitting at the corner table at this beautiful restaurant
The view is beautiful and you feel like you're in a romance movie when looking out onto the river and the skyline
The food was good and the desserts were even better! Definitely a special occasion place!
The waiter nearly yelled at me when I asked for more water
I almost tripped walking in because the coat rack was in the way
I am sorry I took my date here

This is such a great restaurant
It's definetely for a special night, a celebration
The view of Manhattan is beautiful and the food is delicious
There is nothing bad that I could say about River Cafe
You will never regret going there
decorated with flowers all around, the service was good, and the view was awesome
beautiful city views, amazing service, great location
don't forget to order the brooklyn bridge for dessert - amazing chocolate and beautiful presentation
Yes, the River Cafe is still a great romantic restaurant
Yes, the view is still beautiful
Yes, it's still pricey
And no, the food is not that great anymore
But if money is no object, and you want to impress your date with a great view and romantic setting, this is definitely one place to consider
It's still popular, so give yourself a few weeks to make a reservation
And be sure to ask for a table by the windows
Sure, there's really not a bad view in the place, but the window seats affords you the most dramatic sights
The prime appeal here really is the view--the food is pretty good but not quite what you'd hope given the price points
The service is excellent, and it's a great place for Sunday brunch too
Nice to stroll outside the restaurant in summer
Unfortunately the food and the service don't live up to the spectacular setting
For the prices, the food is decidedly lackluster, and the service, unless you are a regular, can be quite rude
If you call ahead on a week day, though, you can often slip into a table by the window for their first lunch seating
When the room fills up, it can be quite noisy
When you're sitting at home thinking about getting Chinese delivery, you're probably imagining something like what they serve at Andy's
Good, basic, sort-of authentic Chinese food at a good price
You won't find any of the wonderful, fancy Chinese cuisine of a true Chinese gourmet, but this place isn't about that
Entrees are right around $10, with fried rice and noodles being a little cheaper
Like most Chinese places, they'll make things not on the menu if you know what they're called
This basement restaurant is clean, but hardly romantic, and has the basic neighborhood Chinese place decor that you find in most Chinese restaurants in the US (i
e
, pink table cloths, wooden chairs, no music, and chinese landscape prints on the walls)
Quick, no-frills service and free delivery
Eat here if you're too tired to cook at home, and you won't be disappointed
the chinese food is excellent
(i have never tried the japanese fare but i've been advised not to)
the decor is pleasant and the service is adequate
prices are reasonable
can't be beat for a neighborhood chinese restaurant
The Scene Superfine is an easygoing, instantly appreciable neighborhood hangout that boasts a kitchen staff armed with serious cooking chops
Inside the capacious, brick-walled restaurant, which sits below Brooklyn's entrance to the Manhattan Bridge, hipsters shoot pool, couples down draft beers and families gather for dinner
Owners are openly welcoming of small children
The Food The daily-changing menu, scrawled on large dry-erase boards, offers a blend of haute cuisine and Texas roadhouse fare
Winners include succulent seared duck breast with rutabaga and sliced shiitake mushrooms, beefy steak au poivre with thin, salty fries and juicy pork chop with garlicky mashed potatoes and bitter greens
Brunch is less ambitious, but just as good: Try the thick burrito laced with zippy green chili
Desserts--particularly the homemade ice cream and tall coconut layer cakes--are essential
We went to Superfine for my 25th birthday and had such an amazing time
The wine selection was superb and the staff was very attentive (we had called ahead a few days since we would be a big group)
One thing to know about this restaurant---the menu changes daily, which I love
Everyone really enjoyed their food
Its the kind of restaurant where you won't get in and out in under an hour, but you will have such a good time while you are there you won't notice! I also noticed this restaurant was recently included in a new Emily Griffen novel called Babyproof
came here on a sunday night -- cute, hip setting in renovated warehouse
the seafood is extremely fresh and delicious: try the grilled shrimp, grilled squid, and catches of the day
the pork chop and burger were really dry and bland, though
the wait staff is friendly but WAY UNDER STAFFED (looked like only 2 chefs in the kitchen) -- we waited almost 50 minutes for our apps and nearly 1 1/2 hours for our entrees
it's really not the waitstaff/chefs' fault -- it's just that management needs to put more people on duty for prime time hours
I had a friend who had her 4-0 b-day celebration there and we had a great time
It was a nice size and everybody was sociable
Met some DUMBO neighbors and they were fun as well
Would come from thr Bronx to do it again!
The food here is fabulous and the prices are decent
everything I've had has been very good and fresh
At the bar i had a delicious burger with home made fries
For brumch the huervos rancheros, for dinner usually a steak
They use local ingredients and they know what they're doing in the kitchen
I can't comprehend reviewers who say they staff has an attitude
In new york, you simply have to smile and say hello to someone, and they will acknowlege you
but if you treat them like they are waiter / waitress robots and don't look them in they eye then maybe they will treat you that way! The service is only slow when they are over crowded
Blue grass brunch is an experience, make reservations and go this weekend
after bruch hang around and have a beer

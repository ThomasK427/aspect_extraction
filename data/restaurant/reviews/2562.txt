I was really anticipating my visit to Carmine's, because I LOVE italian
Both the uptown and midtown restaurants were PACKED, so I thought it must be good
Wrong
Our food took an hour and a half to get, was cold, and they didn't even bring it all
It took another 45 minutes to get a plate of plain pasta -- just noodles! Definately over-rated
The food here is comparable to a sudo-Italian food serviced at a diner
Only someone that doesn't know real food would appreciate this!
Carmine's is great, especially if you have a group of four or more!
great food excellent service,one of the best italian restraunts ive ever ate at
Don't miss Carmine's
especially during the Christmas Season
If you are not in the Christmas spirit after a visit here, then you really need to increase your medication
For a hoot, hang out in the bar area and watch the food runners make their way to tables with portions of food I can't possibly tell you about
You have got to see to believe
I hav eonly been there once but MY GOD this has to be the best Italian resturant I have ever eaten at
I love how they serve family style, it reminds me of dinners with my own large Italian family
The food is plentiful and great, the service is friendly, the bartender is personable and makes a great Margarita! It's loud, fast and busy, just like the city
Was recommended to us and we recommend it to everyone visiting, especially for their first visit to NYC
All at an unbelievably low cost
Four adults ate well and so much for under $75, excluding alcohol!
The atmosphere was great and the portions were even better
Great family style portions and the staff was very helpful
The food was great and one must try there famous salad
great atmosphere huge portions the calamari and red sauce are great
drinks are made right and the prices are very fair
This is the place to go if you have to pick up the check for Aunt Doris, etc
, not for great food!
This is the best Italian restaurant I've been to in a long time
The staff is very friendly,,the food is outrageous
I was with 4 other people,,,we ordered one salad, one pasta dish and one order of bread and easily could have fed two more people
Where can you get value like that,,,and wonderful food too?
You must be kidding! To the obvious real Italian that wrote too much garlic, please stay home and enjoy your Spaghetti-Os and Franko-American Ravioli
Is Carmine's the best Italian food in NYC? No, of course not, but it's very, very good and it's a fun place to go where you get great value for your money
No, I'm not one of those cheapskate tourists
I usually run the other way when I hear of an Italian restaurant with huge portions, because it's usually a lot of mediocre food
No so at Carmine's
The food is at least as good as you'll find at most any Italian restaurant outside of Manhattan, the service is quite good and the ambiance? Well, don't go there if you want a quiet romantic table in the corner
It's loud, circus-like and just plain fun
I'll be back often
Please note, every review that raves about this place has the phrase Every time I come to New York or some such variation
This place is dingy and touristy
I assume people love it because you won't be sneered at when clad in white walking sneakers and tacky sports-team coats fit in with the cheapskate teacher conventions or others trying to cram as much bang for their buck as possible
If you live in New York, there are far superior hole-in-the-walls which are more authentic
The food is fresh but slightly salty and if you are not a fan of family-style dining, do not go here
Good for parties or social functions and picky kids will eat here; good desserts
The food at Carmines is fantastic and ver filling
The portions are HUGE so bring a big appetite and its a good idea to go with others and everyone get something different to share
The wait is always long, so go to the bar for a great cosmopolitian while you wait
The service is sometimes not so great because of the amount of people in the place, but the food is always worth it
There's only one way you leave Carmine's
Stuffed
The Italian food is fantastic and the portions are not to be believed
Bring a large group there so you can get a taste of everything on the menu
Small parties are a mistake due to the family style servings
I suggest 8 people or more in order to get a taste of a variety of food
The restaurant itself is loud and made for large parties
Service is decent but you have to understand most servers are handling parties of 6 and up
Great place to go with your family
It's annoying that the menu is only posted on the wall though
The food is great
way way too much garlic
This really isn't very good Italian food
No doubt about it, if you have more than a few friends, bring them here
The food is great, the atmosphere is is downright noisey-homely, the service is brutish but direct and the price is for those who like to eat, eat, eat
My favorite restaurant in the city
While the LOOOONG wait might test your patience, all good things come to those who wait
The food, belissimo! And beware of the portions, they're family style!!!
Carmine's has the best Italian food in the city
From appetizers to dessert, everything is delicious
They have a friendly staff and the atmosphere is good for a group of friends or family
Carmine's is usually packed and one has to wait for a while to get a seat
We were lucky to be seated right away and served proptly
Though the spagetti that came with our chicken was a bit undercooked, the chicken was great and the desert that followed, huge and YUMMY! Noisy atmosphere makes the place even more fun, though it may become hard to get in after 5PM on Friday- almost every table would be reserved
Sometimes the wait for a table is long or you can't get a reservation at all
Overall, the food is worth it
It was worth the wait , an hour, without a reservation, for an out of this world meal
All reservations were booked for that day, a Tuesday
The portions were enormous, much, much larger than my Italian mama would ever imagine serving to one person! Three people could share one dish! We have leftovers for the week
The food was better than the gourmet meals we had on our cruise , last week
The noise was loud, kind of like some Italian family gatherings
It was very crowded, which tells you that a lot of people were willing to wait for a most wonderful meal!!! Delicious!
I went to Carmine's for dinner after watching a show and the atmosphere there was great
The place had a very family-oriented Italian feel
Maybe it was because there were a couple of groups around us celebrating birthdays and everyone was in a joyous mood
The food was really good and was served in huge family-sized portions
Our waitress was very helpful in providing suggestions for wine and types of pasta to order
It was a very enjoyable experience
Excellent, everything was just excellent, the food, the portions, the waters,!!!!!
Everytime we come to the city we make a point to eat here
The food is to die for
The portions are HUGE and the service is great
We even got take-out to take home with us to Delaware
It is a must visit for Italian food lovers
I loved Carmines, loved the generous portions, the service and the low prices for such a nice restaurant
The food was great
The only thing I don't like is not being able to make reservations unless I have a big group with me
I've been there three times and ordered three different entrees and have not yet been disappointed! Everything is great!! HUge portions
Family style makes it very affordable! Am going back in August
I had heard good things about Carmine's but was dissappointed
First of all no menus except on the wall, not a big deal but I don't see very well so it was annoying

SUM IT: come home to beltway sushi I was pleasantly surprised Ray was able to improve this spot, dishes on belt now fresher than under Genki
I just went to this place on Friday for lunch, right after we set down, they ask us if we wanted soup or house salad thinking that it comes with the lunch, we also ordered the beer, the waitress didn't ask if we wanted a large or small she automatcally opened two small once
When the bill came they charged us for $9 for the salad and $5 each for the beer, when I can get a large beer for 2 @ $6
50
I will never go back again
I love Genki Sushi
The food is always fresh and the service is prompt
I usually sit at the conveyor belt bar and I like that you can choose whatever it is you like from all the many types of sushi that pass you by
I highly recommend Genki Sushi!!
After stopping by on a whim a few months ago, I was so extremely impressed by the fresh Sushi and quality service that I now go there quite often for lunch as well as the occasional take-out dinner
The staff is very personable and they pay attention to the little details ordinarily found in much more elaborate establishments
Every now and then they create special rolls that are quite tasty
Kudos to management - this place is a Midtown gem!
I had take-out on my way home from work so I can't really speak for anything but the food
The sushi was great, inexpensive and prompt and the staff from what I saw seemed friendly
I probably would have ate in if the place had more of a mood or theme or after work special like a happy hour
Overall, pleasent experience
Whether it's been for a quick lunch outing or a bite to eat after work, I've never been disappointed by Genki
The sushi is outstanding - always fresh and plenty of variety on the conveyor belt
The decor is bright and pleasant, and the service is no nonsense
You can be in and out in less than a half-hour for a work day lunch, or you can relax at the end of the day and watch the foot traffic passing on 46th street
Great location, great experience
When I told my friends that I had never had sushi, they gasped in amazement and promtly swept me over to Genki
The conveyer belt is a very interesting touch and makes for a fun ambiance
The staff was friendly and very helpful, they walked me through my first sushi experience with the knowledge of a shaman
The manager came over after seeing how much time our server was giving us, and she was great too, very accomodating and receptive-with a personality! Let me tell you, I had not had great food and great service in a very long time, and Genki Sushi was a breath of fresh air, I will definately be back!
I took my mother friends who were apprehensive about sushi
There are GREAT non-sushi dishes! Great service, no wait on a Wed
night
Fun to pick up plates of gorgeous sushi
LOVED IT! Small, but very well priced compared to NCY sushi
I was a visitor found this place on this site
VERY pleased!
Genki can mean cheerful
Unfortunately, our experience at Genki Sushi was not
We arrived on a Sunday evening in 11/02 to find the place completely empty
Having come for the kaiten-zushi, we were sadly disappointed
What little sushi was on the conveyor belt was not that fresh, and they were out of a number of the standards, like toro
The fish they did have was flavorless; the cold sake we were given to drink seemed watered-down
The unagi tasted canned, the ohitashi appetizer tiny and overpriced
The only decent item I had was the agedashi-tofu
We were amazed that the staff didn't understand what we were ordering when asking for even the most common items by their Japanese names
When I ordered the agedashi-tofu, the waiter confirmed, Octopus? With such low-quality sushi and poor service, Genki Sushi was VERY disappointing
Save your money for a better Japanese dining experience elsewhere
Genki sushi is a huuuge chain in Japan, and I've been to installations there in and Malaysia, and the quality has always been excellent
The NYC branch is no exception--the food is convenient, plentiful, and the fish is very fresh
To my knowledge, it's the only conveyor belt sushi place in NYC, and so the usual stiff formalities of a sushi place do not appy--it's a fun atmosphere, and the decor is upbeat and complimentary
You won't find a multitude of wild, innovative roles, but the staple roles and some delicious fish will be there are done beautifully
The service isn't the best, but you come to Genki for the food, the experience, and the expedience, and that makes for a great meal
For the past few months, I ALWAYS order for delivery from here
I absolutely love their eel don box! I finally had the chance to dine here, and I had a great experience
The servers were really nice and VERY attentive
Whenever we had an issue, they solved the problem immediately
Since I've been ordering from them for a while, I knew the food was going to be great! I think the prices are reasonable, especially the lunch specials
If you want affordable and delicious sushi, this is the place to go!
This is one of the best sushi restaurants in midtown
I have been there for lunch many times and have always enjoyed my sushi
The staff is very good and the sushi quality is always top notch
Try the wasabi tobiko, their's is the best and spiciest in the entire city
A friend and I stumbled across this place one hungry July evening and it turned out to be a great find
The sushi was buttery
The plum wine and sake drinks delicious and reasonably priced - in fact all the prices are reasonable for such a nice east side restaurant
The decor is gorgeous and service was perfect
We paid about $70 for varoius pieces of sushi, chicken teriyaki and drinks
The saki was delicious
The sushi was beyond words
Buttery, fresh, melt in your mouth
The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food
The ambience is very romantic and pleasant
Service was excellent
A very relaxed and pleasing experience
From what they have on the menu, it is missing basic items in standard Japanese restaurant
This restaurant is not authentic
This restaurant is a rare gem among snooty, high-priced New York City Sushi restaurants
Rarely does a quaint, but inviting sushi restaurant open in a convenient location with courteous staff and extremely reasonable prices
They have a Seaweed Soup for those who love Miso Soup, but desire additional seaweed
Further, their fish is extraordinarily fresh, and they have great dishes for non-sushi lovers, too! Try the White MEat Chicken Teriyaki
I found this place and decided to try it on a whim, and I now either dine in or take out from there EVERY night
I tried this place after reading a number of reviews on Citysearch
I was not disappointed
The portions were generous, the food very fresh and the service was quite courteous
The space is quite versatile - perfect for a business lunch or an intimate dinner
Great vegetarian-friendly restaurant with lots of options
I highly suggest the avocado salad with ginger dressing and also the miso soup
Will definitely suggest this restaurant to others!!
and you will find some of the best sushi around
The portions are generous, the staff friendly and accommodating and the prices are very reasonable
The vegetarian sushi rolls are some of the best I've had
The food is very fresh and will keep you coming back for more
Although the menu offers something for everyone, they offer a good selection for vegetarians
You won't be disappointed
Make sure to try the plum wine!
The atmosphere and ambiance were fantastic and the staff was very pleasant
A perfect business meeting setting - there are full service rooms with doors that close for privacy from the rest of the restaurant and allow you to conduct business with no interruptions
The location of the restaurant is ideal for getting taxis or using mass transit (Grand Central is right down the street)
I will be taking all of my clients here for meetings from today forward
Maybe it was just the host or manager that day, but he was very rude and dismissive
I asked for a simple fish dish (salmon) prepared a traditional Japanese way with salt instead of Teriyaki sauce
He acted as if I were crazy and refused
He could have politely explained why or just been less abrasive

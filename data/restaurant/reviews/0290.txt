Delicious, devine, decadent, I love this place
I've been to the other location many times, but just came here for the firsttime recently
Food was spectacular and we used the limo service
A perfect dinner and a play evening
I was extremely excited to eat at Frankie and Johnnies after reading the great reviews that were posted on Citysearch
What a let down! I have been to almost every steak house in the city, and I wouldnt even rank this as top 10
As a White Plains resident, I usually go to the Rye location, but happened to be in the city for dinner last week
Food was just as great as Rye--had the best porterhouse
My friend's crab cakes were slammin and the bread was great, too
The food here is great--from the bread all the way to the steak, of course
I ate here during restaurant week and was really impressed
My boyfriend, who is a meat connoisseur, loved his meal, too
Luckily, we got a spot near the fireplace
So romantic
On my birthday I had a friend surprise me w/lunch which was filet mignon, garlic mashed potatos and garlic bread
The filet had the taste of gas in which was so disappointing
maybe they use a gas grill i have no clue but it wasn't worth it
Although i thanked my friend and ate half of the steak
the mashed potato are decent and the garlic bread is great
Came up from the Florida Keys last week and ate here instead of Uncle Jack's
Loved this place: I had the best crab cakes, great hamburger (with fried onions on top), and great glass of wine
Hands down, one of the best places I've eaten in the city
I enjoyed the food there
steaks very good, lump crabmeat cocktail excellent, and side dishes normal for a good steakhouse
The cons
The was the food came out very slowly and the place wasn't busy
Also the waiter anever asked if the steaks were cooked to out liking or if we wanted anything else
Forget about getting anytype mixed drinks, asked for a Tom Collins and the bartender messed it up
Stick to the beer, wine, and non-mixed drinks
We went to Frankie and Johnnie's again for my boyfriend's birthday and we had the best filet mignon ever
Very tender, cooked that way we requested it
We also had the crab cakes and they were so good
They had these little pieces of potatoes encrusted in them
Also, the steak sauce is awesome
I don't think I can ever eat A1 again
This was so the best steak I've had in years
My friends and I went shopping around 34th Street and just happened upon this place
I'd read about Frankie Johnnie's but had never been to the restaurant
The food was fantastic
And the staff was really friendly--didn't rush us out and didn't mind our huge shopping bags
I have one more shopping run to make before X-mas and I am definitely stopping at Frankie Johnnie's to eat again
The steaks were ok, but the sides were less than mediocre
The staff, service, atmosphere and price were grossly below expectation
They got our reserevation wrong and they seated us at the worst table, near the bathroom
The waitress was got our orders wrong and didn't pay much attention to us, since it was busy
So I've been hearing all about this Frankie Johnnie's place on 37th Street, about how great their steaks are, and I just had to check it out
Well let me tell you, all this talk is true
They really do live up to their reputation
There steak sauce is awesome as well as the potatoes and cream spinach I had with it too
And I hate to say it but it's actually better than Peter Luger's! I mean Peter Luger's guys is well known for their sauce and steak
But I'm tellin ya this place has them beat! So I'm passing the word on and continuing the good reviews I've heard through everyone about Frankie Johnnie's
Check it out! I know you won't be disappointed
My bestfriend and I dined at the W
37th Street Frankie Johnnie's and the food was incredible
I had the sirloin, creamed spinach and the apple streudel
Everything was incredible including the bread they put out on the table
The waiter was really attentive and the atmosphere was very classy
I'm not particularly a meat-eater however my friend LOVES red meat and had heard rave reviews about Frankie Johnnie's so we decided to give it a try
Two words: Totally AMAZING! I had the filet mignon and it was absolutely to-die-for! I'm looking to go back soon which is somehthing I never thought I'd ever say about red meat
My friend had the sirloin steak and I thought he'd order another dish of it
The atmosphere is awesome and our waiter was so sweet
I DEFINITELY recommend it!
Good steak - yes
best steak in NYC - no chance
Lugers, Wolfgangs, Strip House - all are better - i would even say MUCh better
Went to the one on 37th street
Steak Quality - Below Average
Steak was not up to par compared to the big dogs of steak - Peter Luguers / Ruth Chris
No competition
Save your money and go elsewhere
Steak was very bland, lack of flavor, dry (not much natural steak juices)  Service - Extremely slow
We had an appointment at 7pm and did not get served our steaks (porterhouse) main course until 9
We did not get asked how I meal was nor did we get to our refill on waters until pretty much after the steak was finished
It wasn't busy at all
Coat check - don't bother checking it in
Not only was the steak and service disapponting, the place lacks class
We checked in our coats and went to redeem our coats, the coat lady tells us how much to pay to get our coats back
I am always looking for the best steak ever and tried all the big names, but Frankie and Johnny's wins
Ambience was amazing-romantic, but not formal (sit upstairs in a booth near the fireplace)
The service was great and they offered to prepare my ribeye pittsburgh style, which most places won't or can't do
My steak was massive and perfectly crispy and seasoned on the outside and juicy, melting in your mouth on the inside
My boyfriend had filet mignon and ate the entire thing ( I have never seen him clear his plate before)
The creamed spinach and onion rings were amazing, and the coconut sorbet had real pieces of coconut in it
Our bill was $150 for 4 drinks, 2 apps, 2 sides, 2 steaks, and a dessert-very reasonable
We're are now saving up to go there every month-pathetic? Maybe
But it was just so damn good
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone
My husband and I had dinner with our 6 year old daughter after a Yankees baseball game
We felt underdressed because we were still dress in our jerseys, but that was not a problem
Our waiter was wonderful and made our daughter laugh and smile several times during dinner
She even had a good time
Food was succulent
We are looking forward to taking my mother for her 70th birthday
Yes, Frankie and Johnnies serves awesome steak
We had a great meal but when the bill arrived a 15% service charge was added
I would've tipped more! But since they went to the trouble of handwriting the service charge on to my credit card slip for me I just let it me
They are ripping themselves off if they add this service charge automatically
Maybe they thought we were tourists and wouldn't know what to tip
It really is
Frankie Johnnie's Steakhouse is the best steak house in the NYC

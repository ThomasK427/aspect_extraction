we washed our desserts with mint tea which i didnt like it was sweet and tasted like mouthwash
overall, my first foray into north african cuisine was a success
ill definitely be back for more
Went to Nomad last night with a friend, based partly on the reviews here, and mostly because I live nearby and it looks like a nice place
I thought it was a little odd that we weren't offered a seat in the garden area, since I overheard the staff say about a hundred times that it had just been opened; but the back room, where we were, is perfectly nice, if a bit dark (as in, REALLY dark)
My friend got the chicken and olive tagine, and I ordered the couscous royale
Both were really good, tons of food, but my couscous was a touch bland
A bottle of Cote du Rhone was $25
Service is pleasant but a little scattered
Overall, a nice addition to the neighborhood
It seems like they may still be finding their groove, I'll definitely go back in a month or so and try again
I hoped that the high rating meant I might get a good vegetarian meal there despite it being a meat and seafood place
The meat dishes looked well prepared and my friends enjoyed the lamb and prune tagine
The two vegetarian dishes on the menu were just an afterthought--why did they even bother? The only vegetarian starter foul, made with fava beans, was pile of old, leathery beans and not the lovely, oil drenched dish with fresh herbs I'd had elsewhere
The vegetarian cousous was big chunks of boiled vegetables on some couscous with a broth-like sauce on the side--why not cook the veg in broth to add flavor? It was bland and uninspired and reminded me of cafeteria food
I won't be back
I went to Nomad with some girlfriends and had such a nice time! The decor is beautiful and very authentic
The front windows open so on a nice day like when we went, you can get a nice breeze
Also, I hear the garden area in back of the restuarant will be opening soon, even better
The service was so friendly and accomodating, if you have trouble deciding what to order, just ask for a suggestion they are happy to help
You really can't go wrong with that menu, anything you order will be tasty
I had the Algerian Salad and crab cakes as appetizers, both were delish
The Chicken tangine was great, as are al lthe tangine choices
If you leave enough room for dessert you have to get the creme brulee, it is amazing
All in all a good time, I am looking forward to going again
This is an amazing restaurant
The food is excellent with dishes from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia
The frech touch to the dishes makes them truly exquisite while still suthentic North African dishes
The merguez dish is mouth-watering (ask for Fries with it)
Many tajine dishes and couscous entrees are also on the menu
Morrocan pastillas are also a big hit
I can go on and on
Deserts are also a big hit: enjoy the warm profiterolles with caramel
Don't forget to enjoy it with a traditional morrocan mint tea
Apetiziers are also as diverse as the North African cuisines, from hot to cold, mild to spicy but always delicious: try the Algiers salad
Probably the first North African restaurant in the city with true authentic dishes
One word for the decor: Wow! An enchanting arabic decor with a cozy warm atmosphere that would spellbind your senses
The soup of the day was a watery, mild tasting puree with no solid contents
The green salad just ok
The vege couscous was ample but slightly bland
The kuba -- 4 round beef patties strongly spiced with cumin and chile
A little too strong for me; my friend found it fine
It came with a pepper ratatouille and some saffron (?) rice -- the latter being a little too soft and sticky and overly spiced for my taste
The best dish by far was my prune and almond lamb tajine, a lamb shank with velvety, mellow gravy, ample crunchy almonds and some prunes (which, while tender, could have been a bit more cooked)
It was complemented best by the fine semolina bread that they served
For desert we shared the prix fixe desserts: an ample decent, not sweet, creme caramel (flan) and profiteroles
My wife and I tried out Nomad when it opened
We were impressed by the whole dining experience, we have been back twice and on both occasions had a great time
My favorite dish thus far is the saffron shrimp appetizer and for the entree I definitely recommend the seafood or chicken pastilla as-well as the lamb and prune tajine
Nice ambience, beautiful decor and a great addition to the neighbourhood
The first thing that comes to mind when entering Nomad is the atmosphere, one can see that a lot of effort and imagination was put in building the personality of this restaurant, from the music to the dcor to the many North African art items that dress this magnificent establishment
The food is divine great presentation and the verity of dishes is to everyones liking
We tried the Mergez Moroccan sausage and the wonderful Cousous that came in 2 choices meat combination and vegetarian all of witch were delicious and goes great with a very well put together wine list
The backroom is cozy great for parties and intimate dates
The service is very helpful and polite
Overall, the place is everything you would expect from a big name restaurant at a very reasonable price
I enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to everyone
From the intimate and romantic back room to the actual bathroom this place has captured a real North African setting with immaculate detail! The wine list is impressive and the food is absolutely divine, I highly recommend the chicken in philo pastry appetizer although I have not tried anything that I did not adore! From the outside you can't tell how much this place has to offer so I urge you to take a peak and it helps that the wait staff is easy on the eyes :-)
I went opening weekend and due to all the hype
the place was packed
Terribly loud and a little too dark
the food however was terrific, and the service was warm and friendly,knowledgeable, and efficient
Great wine list--- really more French than North African and very fairly priced
Skip dessert, not very imaginative
I must have walked in on the first day this gem opened up
The food was such an amazing fusion of modern traditional American-Mediterranean flavors - my favorite meal in a long time
They have such an eclectic assortment
The athmosphere is perfect for a happy hour around the large bar (especially with the complimentary wings with a $4 beer - trust me they are good)! And the cost was a real pleasant surprise!
I took my associates earlier this week to this new Greek restaurant in midtown Manhattan and I found the restaurant to be very nice
We started with the grilled Calamari, Greek salad was exceptional and veggie chips
All were exceptional
For entrees we tried the whole grilled fish, Barbounia and lamb chops
The fish was outstanding! Cooked to perfection
It was cooked properly and tastest great
For dessert the Chocolate cake with halva, and the Galactobourico were outstanding
This meal was great and not very expensive for the area
It is a great find for my company
I went to Tigerland in May when i was visiting New York, it is a hidden treasure in the east village, no big signs or anything, but the good is superb
The food there is fresh, unique and mostly organic
Desserts are special, they have special menu which features what's in season and fresh
Place is hip and neat, atmosphere is good and price is very reasonable
So next time if you're around the area, should give it a try, you'll LOVE it
Like a said, there isnt any big signs outside, here's a hint, it's between a karaoke place and a Japanese restaurant
dont miss it, or else you miss out!!
Tigerland definitely has a unique formula! The decor is simply beautiful and the food is AMAZING! Make sure you get one of their unique drinks in addition to one of the great wines they offer
we got the ginger soda, mango coconut ice tea and Vietnamese Iced Coffee
all were delicious! Now to the food
excellent layers of flavor and it's all organic too! Definitely get the Mushroom Banh Xeo (crepe), Mussels with Red Curry Sauce and Num Tok (spicy beef salad) to start!!! Then for your entrees, the following are not to be missed: Massaman Short Ribs, Red Curry Duck, Tilapia with Tomato Mint Sauce and the Shrimp Pad Thai!! None of these are to be missed! And don't forget dessert!!! Get the coconut tapioca chilled soup and the mango with sticky rice!  This is an excellent restaurant for dates, hanging out with friends and groups
The service is impeccable as well!!!! GO TRY IT OUT! You won't regret it!!! The flavors created by the chef are truly to die for!
Last night, some of us went out to dinner at Tigerland
The food, service and atmosphere were spectacular
We started with the Sangria and Jasmine Tea, along with the appetizers Angel wings (which lives up to the hype!) and mussels in red curry which was fantastic
For entrees, we had the chicken with string beans, steamed stripe bass with ginger and soy sauce, fried rice with chives (which I LOVED!), curry duck, and shrimp pad thai
The food was excellently prepared - fish was cooked well and the taste took me back to my mom's steamed fish
The pad thai flavor was right on
To finish off, the mango and sweet rice dessert was divine
I highly recommend this place for dinner with friends or for a romantic event
The decorations and colors are warm and inviting as is the service - Miranda is an excellent hostess
The bamboo-in-lucite is attractive and overhead soundbarriers show forethought in design
Also, you must check out the bathroom - gorgeous!  All in all, this place is very hip and modern, and the food is traditional and delicious

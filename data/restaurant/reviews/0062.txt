the food is okay but her service really put a damper on my eating experience at luna park
The ambiance, service and drinks were all great until I noticed the hoards of MICE swarming around the steps behind me
Personally, I have a difficult time enjoying myself when all my energy is focused on keeping both feet off the ground and my eyes on the mice as they race up and down the steps, in and out of crevices and under chairs
Scary
OK, the prices are steep, the service can be lacking to snooty, and the food isn't great (OK, I haven't eaten there in a while)
But you have to love it for the location, and the outdoors
On a nice summer evening, there's no better place to unwind after work
convenient and comfortable but all too pretentious
kinda strange, really, with everyone looking around at each other and all wearing the same styles
but--we need a place like this in Union Square, right
nice place to chill after work for sangria and gossip
The Scene This is an Italian banquet restaurant of the old school
The waiters, all wearing black suits, are serious, courteous, and knowledgeable; the dining rooms are ornate and convivial, with large parties celebrating various things interspersed with dressed-up couples on dates
Just across the street is the neighborhood bocce court
The Food There are no big surprises on the solid menu
Clams, shrimp, mussels, scungilli, and calamari served together in a spicy red sauce atop linguine are full of flavor; steak pizzaiola, a heroic portion of tender beef in a pool of garlicky marinara, comes with a side of spaghetti
The restaurant's veal parmigiana, likewise enormous, is delicately breaded and excellently restrained in the cheese-and-sauce department
The porcini risotto is superb, as are the hot and cold single-serving antipasti
Desserts aren't bad, but not really a strong suit
We love it there
They have great bread and appetizers to start, the greatest seafood risotto and you can never get better veal spedini then there
It is still one of the only authentic Italian restaurants around
Classy waiters and staff
This restaurant was recommended by a local
as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed! We weren't! The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York
we went to this place for my sister's birthday
she and her family been here before
so she recommended the place
my first time there last night and i thought the food was mediocre
my linguini primavera was blah
i normally don't do this, but i kept on adding salt and pepper to my dish
everyone at the table agreed that their entree was boring
the place was too loud
i couldn't hear anything from our table
the bread was cold
the cocktail drinks were watered
the price was too expensive for a meal that tasted blah
service was wonderful though!
Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining, expert / attentive table service and a delectable cuisine
Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms)
Great food at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat! Want to impress? Definitely go here!!! NOTE: Plan ahead, make a reservation and arrive early - parking is tight in the area - valet service is available if all else fails! Enjoy!!!
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe
The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ
You are treated just like royality
There is nothing more pleasant than that
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money
When my husband and go there, we spend $60
00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful
It is expensive but well worth the money
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona
If you want great food, service and decor for a very reasonable price, you must go to Park Side
Everything I've eaten has been incredibly tasty
Never a bad dish
A must try is the shrimp and lobster risotto
All other risotto pales in comparison
The crab cakes are the best I've had anywhere
I'm always shocked when the bill comes because it's so inexpensive
Be prepared for a semi-Sopranos crowd, but I think it just adds to the ambiance
It's usually hard to get a reservation at a normal hour so call way in advance or be prepared to eat at 5:00 or 10:00
Go here
Classy, inexpensive, high quality
I must say if you like Italian you will feel like you are sitting in the Godfather here
It is so so so good and so classic
Parkside stands the test of time, I used to be a regular Friday night customer 20 years ago and the food, service and decor was superb then and to my delight is just as wonderful today! My compliments to both Owner and Staff!
I have eaten there for 20 years and never had less than a very good meal and service to match
The menu is solid and the specials are always delicious
Try the crab cakes you wont be able to compare them!
My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater
We always enjoy the pizza
Some great thin crust!! I've never had any of the dinners
The service is pretty good
No complaints!
I've eaten at Patsy's throughout the city a few times- tonight was the worst
We had a waiter who could care less that my sausage/garlic/rigatoni dish tasted like vaseline, it was probably the grossest pasta dish I've ever tasted
AND he told us, quite promptly, when we asked him to take it back, that we would be charged for it
The pizza was 'okay-' but it is frankly, hard to mess up pizza
you just have good dough and throw fresh ingredients on it
But that pasta dish- and the rude/inconsiderate waiter- unacceptable
I won't be eating here again in the future

My husband and I are from the Seattle area and were looking for a really good New York pizza experience
We were not disappointed at Patsy's
We had no wait and the service was very good - took a little while to get our pizza but considering they brought us bread and salad before, we didn't mind
They even refilled our water glasses like 4 times during our meal - and we weren't there all that long
I definitely recommend Patsy's to anyone who's wanting a really good pizza in Midtown Manhattan
Although you do have to wait some time for the food it is worth it nice place very good service great pizza would recommend
I've enjoyed every trip I've made to Patsy's, but I can see why others might be put off
Yes, it's crowded and yes the service can be not so nice at all times
This is NY, it happens
If you can't tolerate slow service at a pizza place, then spend more money elsewhere
Patsy's has great salads - I prefer the arugula salad
Their prosciutto pizza is my personal favorite ($2 for each topping)
Expect a crowd while waiting, but they seat quickly
Great atmosphere and good food describe Patsy's Family Style Pasta dishes and Brick Oven Pizza
Unlike most whole in the wall Pizza places, you can taste the real Olive Oil in their pizza's
not some greasy corn oil

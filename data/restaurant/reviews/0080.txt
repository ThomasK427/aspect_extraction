Desserts are simple and satisfying
I see many terrible reviews on here but I disagree
I went on Sunday for brunch and the service wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad at all
The tuna melt I had was great and the space is nice
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it! Read all the other review, they'll confirm it
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there
It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk! Oh, but wait, we were out of drinks (which were also delightfully overpriced)
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool
You guys are awesome!
It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty
The pretentious waitstaff ignored us for the rest of the evening (except of of course when they were bumping into my chair
)  This place is actually cozy looking and has passable food, but it is so unpleasant because of the people who work there
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing
I agree
I mean urgh
The pink phony [a name I have recently adopted] is a pretentiously marketed restaurant/bar venue
The menu is written in one of those ways that dazzel and confuse the not so experienced consumer
To elaborate; the menu is written in French but the dishes themselves are something that your - enthusiastic yet talentless boyfriend - might muster up for you, leaving you looking concerned for his love for you
Not only is the presentation poor, but the taste AND the service lack luster
Waitresses are more interested in their vintage tee's and when Vincent Gallo is coming in again than they are about the actual customers
Go for coffee and drinks at most
Pah about sums it up

Interesting reviews
This was the best food I had on my trip to New York
I ordered the Spicy Morrocan Chicken and my friend ordered the steak
I even tried escargot for the first time - tastes like chicken ;) haha Tasted like garlic, actually
I'm no food connoisseur, but I thought it was all very tasty
I loved it
I thought the place was warm and cozy, too
Had a really pleasant experience, and it's one of my nicest memories of the trip
It was a bit pricey, but worth it
Hmmm? Maybe I just got lucky
Man, that chicken (in some kind of spicy soup) was yummy!
I stopped in around 6pm,midweek
Sitting at the almost empty bar, I watched as the bartender ignored me and got really involved/confused with counting her cash register
The place was overstaffed with affected people whose sole endeavor was to look busy but not really do anything---like they were all holdingout for someone else to wait on the customers
Reluctantly, some girl took my order
I don't know what happened to her, never saw her again
Had to basically recruit a new server every time I wanted a drink, my meal, my check
My salad came along with my sandwich and fries
Did I eat my soggy salad before it got soggier? Or did I tackle the fries before they got cold? Bad luckily, my fries were already cold (and chewy?) The salad was overly dressed with a horrible SALT vinagrette
Sandwich was terrible
Food and staff? Horrendous
Don't go here
Don't go for brunch
We weren't given silverware or sugar until we flagged the waitress down
The iced tea came in insultingly tiny glasses
They gave our order to another table and it took them several minutes to figure out that it was our food
The portions were too small
When we finally got the waitress' attention for a refill on coffee she brought it to the table next to us instead
When we paid our check, another waitress gave our change to the table next to us
They hit me with a plate and almost poked my friend in the eye with a fork because they were in such a hurry when clearing
This would've been understandable if the place had been packed but it was only half full
This is a well-established eatery but from the service you'd think that it was everyone's first day on the job
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood
) the food is decent
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i
e
make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty
hmmm
we love th pink pony
THe perfect spot
Food-awesome
Service- friendly and attentive
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart
A couple of times we wanted to have dinner there, and so we did last Monday
We were cramped on a tiny table where 4 others wanted to play some games
We could get a new table
Half of the food was out
The food we got was mediocre, nothing special
At one point the waiter completely forgot about us
No wine, no taking away the dishes, not even handing the check
To make up for it, we got a glass of wine from another waitress but the evening was kind of spoilt
The music in the beginning was country and it got finally better (!) when they played Eminem
I think that says it all
It's my first posing here at city search because I really want to warn people for that nepp!
Well
ok
My vegetable Napoleon was good; although i first got the veggie burger because the waitress mis-heard and stood my friend up for another 15 minutes of waiting to have it served
Ok
so back to the Napoleon was pretty yamie but over deep fried
Otherwise good place
Interesting talks on the side
especially by French-sters
The service was very mediocre and bourgeois like
pretty direct
Ok ok
I'd rather go across to the pinard
What's so great about the Pink Pony's brunch? Eggs Florentine are okay as are the eggs benedict
Nothing's great here

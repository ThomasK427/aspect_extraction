The oysters are out of this world and you must try the Paella
The portions are great
The manager greets and the waiters ensure that you are never dry - Great Service! If you want a real NY expiereance - get your appetitite for fine dining and a good time to the Blue Ribbon
One of my favorite restaurants in NYC
so far
Wish I wasn't moving out of Brooklyn! But I'll probably come back just to go to Blue Ribbon! Amazing, attentive, friendly service, absolutely fantastic food and wine selection
I had the catfish
beautifully spicy and excellent sides
My boyfriend had lovely oysters and good duck
Nice atmosphere too
A must try!
I think i'm addicted to the oysters, this is absolutley the best restaurant in the Slope a bit pricy but worth every dime!
Part of the unending Fifth Avenue gentrification parade, Blue Ribbon's' nonetheless a welcome addition to the growing restaurant strip
Great, savory seafood and charming service merit at least a try, though prices can get steep at dinner
The Scene The famous chef may call his third restaurant a bistro, but to leave it at that would be a little misleading
No bistro in New York has loftier aspirations, a fact that becomes plain the moment you enter
Decor is visually arresting--photographs of flame-red dahlias that evoke a hell-risen legion of Georgia O'Keeffes are particularly memorable
The Food Though cheaper than Daniel or Cafe Boulud, a meal here still guarantees at least one or two moments certain to leave the average diner stumbling for superlatives
The perfectly attuned crunch of sliced almonds in a beautiful salad of lobster, artichokes and string beans shows inspiring attention to detail, as does the warmth of the tomatoes in a savory take on a tarte Tatin
DB's burger, a juicy conglomeration ground beef, foie gras and braised short ribs, is outrageous
Just returned from a prix fixe restaurant week lunch at db
Sometimes I dislike going to places like this during restaurant week because as soon as you order the prix fixe they start treating you like a second-class citizen
To the contrary, my server here was exceedingly pleasant and polite, as was every waitstaff person who came by to check on me or deliver or remove a plate
The food was not heart-stopping, but it was very, very good, especially for this touristy part of town, where I am forever trying to find a nice lunch spot to visit with familly or friends during my workday
A tip: Though it gets crowded, they will seat you in the bar area without a reservation if your party is small (one or two), and give you the exact same menu as in the main dining areas
Went there early dinner
Got seated near the kitchen, cramped as soon as the place filled up
Heard the cook screaming
The standard bistro fare was well executed, Great burger with cute condiments display
Still, the place is overpriced and I won't go back
The food is great especially the seafood
Although our server disappeared from the beginning but the manager made it up, he was very sincere and provided good recommendation
We will go back again!
I went to DB when it first opened a few years ago and had a wonderful experience
I made the mistake of returning only to find that it has morphed into a bigger Times Square Tourist Trap than Planet Hollywood
The food was truly awful and the service complacent (including the waiter that spilled a tray of water on me and refused to apologize b/c it was water
) There are so many wonderful bistros in this city, please do not waste the money or a night out on this one
friend took me here for my birthday after a show and everything was near perfect
burger was what they said it would be
the waitstaff were polite and knowledgeable
definitely professionals
the sommelier picked the right wine for the night
limited scotch list though but i guess it makes sense since they don't technically have a bar
I found the decor very relaxing and proportional; it didn't detract from the food
they were very patient with us as we were the last ones in the restaurant, literally closing it down
by then, we were lit to high heavens
i'd go back for the burgers
We felt like sardines crammed into this pourly laid out restaurant (and unwelcome due to the obnoxious host)
The food was average, which made the ridculously high prices almost laughable
The salads were standard lettuce and dressing fare, the meat was undercooked and tastless
Our waitress was nice, although she almost seemed embarassed to be working at such a pretentious establishment
And the fact that you had to leave the resturant to go to the bathroom, then wait on line for five minutes, only added to the ridiculousness
Oh, but on a brighter note, when the waiter poured water into my vodka glass by mistake, we got a free drink out of it
Don't let the famous name trick you into thinking that you're going to get a great meal
We made reservations on a slow night and were seated promptly next to the door
The decor is depressing
The long, narrow room is uncomfortable
The tomato tatin, flavorless and boring
The expensive colossal shrimp were 4 extra large bland shrimp
Ditto for the bed of green risotto
The squash soup was too sweet, the pork platter bland (two waiters told us how awesome it was)
The duck confit had some flavor
The molton chocolate had none - that's a culinary feat! The wine list is rediculously priced
You sit in the low, moderne chairs and think, I'm paying the rent here and that's about it
DB gives the world yet another chance to laugh at New Yorker's as we over pay for food at an average restaurant
DB Bistro is without a doubt one of the best bets in the theatre district
The food is great, the place has great energy (always packed) and the staff is very helpful
For a less hectic experience go after the pre-theare rush
You have more time to enjoy yourself and the menu expands to even more great choices
Wine: Great choices but the markup is astronomical
The waiter brought us our bottle of wine, saw that we had okayed it and then left to open it away from the table
Appetizers: The escargots were more potato than escargot
The potato did not complement the escargot
Disappointing
Main Course: The Hamburger was nothing special, in spite of the hyped ingredients
Coffee: Outstanding
Atmosphere: French bistro like (shoulder to shoulder) without the cigarette smoke
Very loud interior
Location: Great location just East of the Theater District
Hamburger, on a scale of 1 -10 (10 being the best), maybe a 7
not worth $30
Hanger steak was salty and chewy
Banana/chocolate dessert was below average
The restaurant did have a unique menu of seafood that i regret not trying
The waiter recommended a perfect wine, exactly what i had described to him
Service was good
it was nice that the staff didn't jump at our plates as soon as we put our forks down
The waiters, bus boys and hosts were all very nice
Overall our experience was ok, a place to go to if you want to overpay for average food
i just took a recruit out to lunch to this joint
been there few times before; nothing stood out until today
we started with the butternut-squash soup and the artichoke soup, both which has such unbelievable flavors, then we all shared the unbelievable shrimp risotto, the burger of course, and the special skate, which was hands down the best fish dish i've had in a very long time
but the real kicker was when i ordered dessert (heavenly pumpkin chocolate mousse), i made a joke about also ordering an umbrella since it had just started raining outside, and the waiter went into the hotel next door and got us one! how's that for service
Staffs are not well trained
I ordered escargots but for some reason they forgot to put the escargots in the dish
Ordering the popular DB burger is a mistake
The meat is COLD, the fries are soggy and greasy
And i can't even taste the foie gras and the truffle
McDonald's and White Castle's burgers are WAY better than DB's
After being at Daniel and Cafe Boulud i figured that I would try DB

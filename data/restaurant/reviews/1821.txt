Hands down, this is the best pizza I've ever had
It was a hot day, but the breeze deck was just what the doctor ordered after a day of schlepping all over Manhattan
And the best surprise? The staff were all very FRIENDLY! I was starting to wonder if I was really in a NYC restaurant
A must if you are in SoHo
This place lived up to it's ranking, I couldn't stop eating
Service was a little rough and we got stuck back by the pickup counter but who cares- it's a pizza joint! We ate at Johns the day before and it was close, but Lombardi's rules
I admit, the service is lacking, but you are in New York, so my expectations were low
It took them a while to even acknowledge that I was waiting for a seat, despite the lack of a crowd
However, once I received my pizza, I was impressed
The mozarella was very fresh and the tomatoes and basil mixed perfectly to make a very tasty NY pizza
If you aren't obsessed with great service but good food, I highly recommend it
We showed up and waited 30 minutes in line 30 minutes to get our drinks -after we asked twice, the service was the worst I've had in nyc
The pizza was alright nothing to get excited about the crust was burnt , cheese was skimp , I would rather get a slice any where else
this is the pest pizza in the word first of all it is fresh they make pizza infront of you
toppings are fresh Lombardi's pizza looks much better than the others
service is excellent food is excellent atmosphere is excellent
How on earth did this pizza get such good ratings???!!! The crust was burnt and dried out, the toppings were very skimpy and bland, the cheese was barely there, and the sauce was just ok
You will get more satisfaction by eating a frozen pizza from your local grocery store
Also, the salad was disgusting and had far too much vinegar on it
This must be the most overrated place I've ever been
The pizza sucks! Totally burnt crust with horrible service
I almost walked out without paying but wanted to be the bigger person and paid for the garbage they call pizza
John's is by far the best pizza
I really liked the pizza at Lombardi's
It might be one of the best pizzas I've had in Manhattan
If you're a garlic fan, request for fresh garlic on your pizza, free of charge
I've been in the city a few months and I finally found the genuine nyc pizza!   I've worked in pizza places n I've eaten all kinds of the stuff and I can honestly say this is the BEST pizza I have ever eaten- the dough is good, the sauce is good, the cheese is good, its just perfect! Only gripe would be the place is a bit small so it might be tough to fit large groups
All in all service is really fast and prices are really fair- great place to bring visitors to nyc!
Not being from the city, I was a little intimidated when trying to find a reasonable location to meet my new friends (on-line gamers) for the very first time
Boy, was I ever successful! Lombardi's was such a great place for a few friends to meet
The pizza was the best! The atmosphere lended itself to just such a meeting
The prices were very reasonable
Everyone had a great time! I highly recommend it
(We did make reservations, since we had a group of 8, but had a short wait when arriving a little early
)
Fantastic pizza!!! Dough, sauce and cheese couldn't be put together any better, the pie's flavor was fantastic
Though it's different, Lombardi's is tied as my favorite with DeLorenzo's Tomato Pies in Trenton, NJ
This place is a must for all those who want to tast real pizza!! Go there and stand in line, it'll be worth it
we should have ask the waiter to send us a new pie
the one we got was slightly burnt on the taste of the pizza was runied
it was my first taste at lombardi's it was a dissapointment
i didn't like the bake clams either
Ordered the clam pie as recommended and my mouth felt like it was going to fall off from chewing the chewy chewy clams so much
However, if the clams were more tender, this would be a no brainer 10
Will definitely go back and get a different topping
There is a reason why it is so difficult to get a table here
The pizza is the best I ever had
Being originally from Brooklyn, I thought I could never find a place that tops any of the pizzarias of the borough
But this place does
The service is a head ache but the pizza more then makes up for it
Be ready to wait a while for a table even if you have a reservation, but is definitely worth it
By far the best pizza i have evere had
I was a visitor from chicago and lombardi's definitely topped any chicago pizza
If ever back in new york, i will go back again and again
What else can be said of the creator of pizza? May god bless his wonderful soul!!! The sauce here is unreal, full of fresh tomatoes and spices
The fresh basil on top is also a nice complement
Until I eat a better pizza from a no-slice establishment, Lombardi's is the absolute best pizza you can eat in New York
Yes, I've been to the other famous joints, and they're all in the 9 category - except maybe Totonno's in Coney Island, which is a 9
5
But I do believe Lombardi's earns a 10
If you are a pepperoni lover, you have not lived until you have a Lombardi's pepperoni pizza
If only for that, I set them aside
The reviewers here are definitely right about telling them not to burn the crust if you don't like a well-done pie, which is how they make it
(But I actually think it adds to the flavor
) And don't hesitate to take them up on the free garlic topping, because ain't nothing else even close to free here!
I have always praised Lombardi's as being the best pizza joint in NY
However, the past few times I have eaten there, the clam pie and the regular pie have dissappointed
The clams were rubbery and I found shells, the crust burnt
It's just not the same anymore
I read reviews about the famous clam pie
and decided to go there for a try when I'm visiting New York
Well
to be honest
I was a little disappointed
the crust was crispy tasty
but the clam is too much
it has that really strong seafood smell that I'm not too fond of
I rather eat the crust without the clam
And it is a little pricy
but other talbe's pizza looks pretty yummy
maybe i oughtta try the real pizza next time
I dont think I have had any better pizza anywhere! I think it tops Pepe's in New Haven
Ive been lucky enough to fly in to NYC twice for lunch and it was fantastico!! I will always be a Lobardi's die-hard
I hope to be back soon!
I've given this place 2 shots2/2002 2/2003
Both times I was disappointed
I must give them points for consistency
Both visits the crust was burnt although tasty and there were plenty of chunky toppings, but that's where it ends
Sauce is scarce and has little taste
I'm not sure that they even remembered the cheese
Each bite was nothing but dough because the stuff couldn't stay on the crust, call it a lack of cheese or blame it on the topping size, but any way you slice it, this place is definitely not even on my great pizza list
A+ for ambience
Pizza was the best I ever tasted
I would recommend anyone who visits New York, to try Lombardi's!
Good pizza
Ask them to cook it for shorter than usual because they almost always burn the crust
Definitely not worth a wait, especially when Pomodoro's is 50 feet away and better but Lombardi's is good for a change every so often
I have know idea how Lombadis can be ranked one of the best pizzerias! We ordered a small pepperoni pizza for delivery
It took over an hour to reach us and the pizza was hard and cold! And to top it off the service could not understand why we were upset! I have eaten at many pizzerias around the city (I wouldn't call myself an expert), but this was the most expensive, disgusting pizza I have ever eaten
An embarrassment to NY slices!

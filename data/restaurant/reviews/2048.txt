The restaurant is small, there were under 15 tables, but it wasn't annoyingly crowded at all
I need to get the recipe for that sangria!
The menu was traditional cuban with a few additional treats
The Ceviche was a standout, but everything was above average from the fried plantain and refried beans to the homemade guac and yellow rice
It ranked with some of the better places I've eaten at it Key West
The waiter (who may have been the owner) was pleasant and attentive
I will go back
I would recommend to friends
Good, basic, no frills Cuban
Great spot for those nights when you don't want italian, don't want sushi, don't want anything, hmmm
how about Cuban?!
If only the service were faster, and the menu not so limited, this could really be something, although I'm not saying that I don't like it, I do, its a good restaurant, with some really good entress, of course Pearl is right down the street, and that place is amazing!
Wonderful food, impecable service, great warm atmosphere
A great, where do we go for something new and different place
In Short Despite the implications of its name, Pepe Verde (the West Village cousin of Pepe Rosso) is as much about sit-down snacking as it is about takeaway meals
The bare-bones dining area offers a spot to grab the lunch special (soup or salad plus entree), or linger longer over bowls of fusilli with tomatoes and arugula, or penne with tomato, mozzarella and basil
Pepe Verde is the closest thing in NYC to eating in an Italian trattoria
The food is simple, of good quality and reasonably priced
This place is a find!
i just stopped by and tasted some pasta w/ my firnd, and we both liked what we ordered
the price was unbetable in this lovely greenwich neighborhood and food was also great
the place is small and crowded, but it is very pleasant
The restaurant is cozy the decor is appealing
The server we had was attentive and friendly, although he was a little weird with his random off the wall comments
My brother I enjoyed everything we tried I must say the mango chicken topped my list
The coconut rice was sooo good, so be sure to order a side of it
Go here for good food in a nice atmosphere
I am highly disappointed with my experience at Dragonfly
The food was pretty good but you can definitely find better elsewhere in NY, especially because of my experience with the service
On an odd corner at 7th Ave, Dragonfly is the best place to go when you crave Filipino food in Greenwich Village
It has a Pan-Asian Cuisine, so you can order Kerabu Chicken, (a must try!), kare-kare (tripe in peanut sauce; a Filipino dish) and eat it with
This is a lovely, relaxed little bistro on Hudson -- a real break from the fast pace of the city
The food -- especially soups -- is excellent, and the service is gentle and genial, if not exactly speedy
But if you have time to indulge in a lengthy, pleasant, lowkey meal, this is a great place to do it
Where else do they still have Spaghetti and Meatballs on the menu? I thought the food was great - my Penne Siciliana came sprinkled with fresh mozzerella
Service was prompt and friendly
Highly recommended
I highly recommend this spot
I have taken two large parties (8 or more and with kids) to this restaurant on two separate occasions and have been treated with prompt and friendly service
My dad, who is a picky eater, was even able to order off of the menu
Another time there were four of us and we had an appetizer, 2 bottles of wine, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts and our bill came to a measly $80! The food is not authentic Italian, but it is good
So if you are not an Italian food snob, but you like good food at good prices and great people-watching, then be sure to check out this restaurant
The nightly specials are always sure to please
Horrible service at this restaurant
We ordered are food at the same time as the table next to us
They were served, finished eating, and given their bill all before we received our appetizers
We sat waiting for some explanation as to where our food was but were constantly ignored as if we were invisible
Don't know where our waiter had disappeared to
We were told once that our food was on the way, and 15 minutes after that, it did appear
It wasn't anything to write home about and was overpriced for what it was
I wouldn't eat there again, in fact, I'd rather go hungry
oh wait, we almost did
This is the greatest restaurant in town
Great food and service, loved it and I higly reccomend it! Love to visit with the family or friends
The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable
My chicken parmigiana was excellent and I liked the house wine
In addition, the location can't be beat - lots of people-watching from the outdoor seating
This is THE place to eat when you're in the Village !!
Fine food at decent prices
The service require some improvement
A requirement of being employed at Trattoria Spaghetto must be to write a review with a Ten rating
The service is aloof
The rabbit was dried out, as were the meatballs
The main ingredient of each dish was salt -- a poor attempt to cover the blandness of the food
In the five years I have lived in NYC, this was the worst Italian food I have had
Go to Little Italy!
The Scene Since 1972, this unmarked West Village carriage house has been the setting for some of the city's most romantic meals
The sprawling wood bar, with its blazing fireplaces and a baby grand piano, looks out over a candlelit dining room and formal balcony, where tuxedoed servers pamper the special-occasion crowds with requisite pomp and pretense
The Food In recent years, the continental three-course prix fixe has morphed into an exciting--and as expected, indulgent--internationally inspired menu
Start with puffy goat-cheese gnocchi napped in black-truffle butter, pancetta and sweet roasted onions, or pastry-topped seafood gumbo served with aromatic homemade breads
Rosy, sage-streaked duck breast pairs nicely with crispy confit, braised chanterelles and acorn-squash spaetzle, and the signature beef Wellington--a gigantic, buttery seared fillet slathered with foie gras and baked in pastry--is better than ever
The towering chocolate souffle, intensely flavored and light as air, is exemplary
I brought my father to OIBL TIBS when he came to visit from out of town
The ambience is a mix of Tavern on the Green and a retirement home dining room
The wait staff were polite and professional
Our first course and dessert were good, but our entrees were all below average
The restaurant was so loud that one couldn't even hear the piano and had to speak quite loudly to have a conversation
Definitely too loud to be romantic
Just went to this past Friday for my Birthday
The service was fine
courteous and polite
Food, was good as well, if a bit oily
Their Jackets Required policy must be on a relaxed summer schedule as we saw a few jeans in the restaurant and very few jackets
So romanitc? Not really, but it is a great place to take your parents when they come in from out of town
I finally got to go to One If By Land after years of living in NY
And I was not at all disappointed
The place is cozy and classy and refined
The food is elegantly prepared and the service is impeccable
I actually avoided the Beef Wellington and tried the monkfish instead, which was moist and flaky and delicious
My dinner companion had the roasted lobster, which I highly recommend
We both had the Lichido Coladas, which we're both already craving
And, of course, the chocolate souffle for dessert, which was delish
But then again, I have yet to meet a chocolate souffle I didn't like
I came here with my boyfriend for a special occasion and boy, is it ROMANTIC! It's a little snooty and everyone is around 40-ish of age, so we were the youngest couple in the whole restaurant
We didn't order any drinks but we felt pressured to because EVERYONE had champagne and wine, etc
We ordered the Parmesan Gnocchi, but I didn't really like it
He had the Foie Gras which was very good and very smooth! Entree: BEEF WELLINGTON was sooo delicious
I recommend getting it rare because I didn't think my medium-rare was rare enough, he had the duck but I thought my beef tasted much better
For dessert, I had the chocolat fondant which was good because it was light and not-too-sweet and melted in my mouth
He had the Creve Blueberry Cheesecake, but again I liked mine better

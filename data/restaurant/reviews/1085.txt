The small bar is always packed with people, and you have to constantly contend with waiters asking you to move as they navigate through the crowd to make it to their tables
We had an hour wait past our reservation time, so dealing with the bar scene was not helping things
The food is ok, but nothing special
Let's face it, people go there to see and be seen
If you want to experience the shallow MPD scene, enjoy
Vento is trendy, but don't clammor there for the food - as it is pretty average
Service was very good, attentive waiters who ar friendly but unobtrusive
My steak was overdone, but the halibut special was exquisite and the wine list more than passible
Dessert looked great and I was sad not to try it
Location is tre cool and it garners a good looking corwd, particularly late evenings on the weekends
wine menu is complicated (only italian names) and wine is very expensive
One of the cheapest wine (recommended by the waitress) is a chianti of $40 that had a bitter taste
however, the pizza is good, tastes like in italy
BUT service is TOO fast !! it's so unfashionable/rude to take away the guests' plates while one person is still eating!! also the ckeck and desert menu came too fast
The veal chop, though expensive ($38), is really fantastic
The pizza with wild mushrooms and truffle oil is also top notch
Rather than butter, they offer a peppery, olive oiled riccota that is really great too
Reasonable wine list and good selection of Italian beers
Service is good enough
I can't see what the complaints are about this place
I really like it
Sit upstairs if possible - its better
The menu is--what? ersatz Italian, I guess
Servers seem dazed and, yes, also confused
(sometimes angry, as well
) Scores of employees walking around, but no one seems to clear a plate or offer more drinks
Maybe the downstairs club is better
?
We couldn't get reservations until 9:15 on a Friday night b/c they were booked solid, but when we showed up really early, i
e
7:30, the place was empty! They sat us right away and the place didn't pick up until 8:45
An obvious ploy to make it seem more popular
The service was average and the food left much to be desired
Drinks were good
If you want to ckeck out the crowd, eat somewhere else and then just go here for drinks
I recently had a large birthday party here
and it was great
The service was amazing
even though our waitress was very busy, she made sure we always had exactly what was needed
The owner checked in on our table to wish my friend and I a happy birthday, and also supplied us with free dessert for the entire party
I would highly recommend Vento
it's one of the best places i've ate in the city
Do yourself a favor and try the casarecci
It was one of the better dishes I've tasted in awhile
Service was excellent water glasses were full, with lemon slices offered
They gave us a small comp dessert at the end the meal, which we ate even though we were full;) More than I can say for overhyped the Spice market down the street
Upon calling to reserve a table outside for Brunch, the manager requested a cc nbr to secure the table for 6 (I was 8 months pregnant and there was a little baby)
I was told if we didn't turn up I would be charged $25 pp
That was fine with me since we were definately going! Our party arrived on time to which we were told there was no table outside for us! Even a cc could not even hold the table???? There were free tables outside to which he said that he was understaffed and we couldn't sit there
The manager was USELESS!!! We went to Pastis instead! After our meal at Pastis we noticed the outside area was packed! I've never experienced this attitude before - DON'T GO!!
Went there with mixed expectations
Owners' other restauratns are either barely OK or hellish/BT-ish/touristy
This is a bit of everything
Food is good and even rather adventuresome for a blatantly commercial enterprise such as this
All the dishes that we had at our table were consistently good, although not great (nor poor, either)
If you are mostly interested in the food, you'll be disappointed
If you want to go for the scene/atmosphere, you might as well go to Jersey
On the other hand, good place to go with a group of friends to chat and relax
Service was attrocious
We sat outside I had to yell at the busboy to stop bumping our table every time he walked by
I know the tables are tight, but they need to fix that too! This is of course after waiting forever for menus and eventually having to ask for them
I should also mention they seated 5 of us at a table clearly meant for 4 people
We would have sat inside if someone had just told us there aren't any large tables outside
Food was mediocre, certainly not enough to compensate for the service
I can't imagine anyone going there more than once
Especially with One, Spice Market, and 10 other places just outside
Went here right after opening
Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down
We ordered a ton of stuff, all of which was pretty nasty and flavorless, had a few bottles of expensive wine, but that tasted terrible too
The bill came out to like $100pp, and noone touched their food, and drinks were left untouched because after the first bite/sip you want to never touch it again
I hope this place shuts down and am waiting for something great to open up in this great building
Do not go here if you are over 30
Neighbors, don't be bothered
They hate us
They're rude
They'll be out of biz soon
See the owner, on his cel phone, pace and scream at his backers
He's the best sidewalk entertainment in the far West Village
We came to celebrate a friend's birthday, and all of our expectations were met
The staff was delightful - our waitress, although a bit flighty, was a total sweetheart
We were seated promptly (we had a reservation)
The food was fantastic
We split the insalata and the orange marinated prawns - the salad was ok, but the prawns were especially wonderful
(They do come w/ the shells, so take note!) The pasta was wonderful - truly al dente
We had the gelatti for desert in a variety of flavors - pistachio, cheesecake, coconut, tiramisu, each flavor was amazing! The space is amazing - everything from the paper wrapped candles to the exposed brick to the lighting, to the shape of the room itself was exquisite
And the people watching can't be beat
All in all, a great time
We had prompt and friendly service, plus the food was dynamite
I had the baby octopus appetizer and the Tagliolina pasta with shrimp and brocolli rabe (very tasty)
The lemon tart for dessert was amazing--even for someone who typically would never order a lemon dessert
the wine list has some great big Italian reds
pretty cool ambience too
The best thing about Vento is the location, everything else leaves a lot to be desired
1) Service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea
) 2) Food is sub par and way over priced ($15 for a burned 1-person pizza, $20+ for a seafood entree that looked like it was defrosted in a microwave) 3) The space is aesthetically pleasing but the acoustics are terrible
Outdoor seating is a nice feature but I'm sure they will figure out a way to mess that up too
My general impression was that I felt like I was at an Applebees with poor service and a terribly overpriced menu
I expected a lot more but was left annoyed and disappointed by the whole experience
You'd think that after opening several successful restaurants around NYC, you'd have the formula down
Logical things like not taking reservations for every table in the restaurant and bringing bread to the table without having to ask have escaped the management

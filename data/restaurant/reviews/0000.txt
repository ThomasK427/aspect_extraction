What do I like about Jeollado? I like the 2 for 1 rolls (sometimes 3 for 1) the prices and the variety on the menu
What don't I like? The rolls are tiny so you have to order more anyway and they will often get your order wrong if you stray from the menu
For the money, it's a dependable and fun place to get sushi - bring friends and share the 2 for 1 rolls (they have to be 2 of the same
)
This place is a great deal for the price and the food they give you
Crab rolls are made with real crab, not the imitation crab
They also have a great unagi bim bim bap that you must order
Go here if you want a little bit of Korean combined with a little bit of Japanese food
Place is casual, not fancy
Short of cash, with a big group, starving? This is the place
Okay, not the most delicate or delectible, but absolutely satisfying and the sake is cheap too
Portions are pretty amazing- especially the Amy roll for $8- damn thats a lot of food for $8
And the Jeollado (seaweed) salad- sometimes I get take-out somewhere else and go get that salad to be healthy and fill me up
All in all a great place, but not the most refined
Oh, also a pretty good scene, lots of people to look at
There may be nicer places, or cheaper places, but Jeollado is probably the best cheap sushi in New York City
Jeollado's house rolls are definitely a popular draw
They are damned good
You just have to try it for yourself
I've been to Jeollado a bunch of times, and the fish is nearly always fresh
But I must admit I have stumbled on a couple of un-fresh days, but they are rare
The wait staff is nice, but they are kind of inattentive
The atmosphere is like a cafeteria, so it's not romantic
However the casual atmosphere comes in handy if you want a good place to drop in and get food
It's not a place to impress a date
But it's perfect place to meet with someone for good-tasting sushi when a restaurant-y place would be too much for casual dining
Jeollado has seen its good days and bad days
overall the restaurant has great prices for the value
Loud cafteria seatings and great for large groups
There is a private room in the back for parties which include KTV
Jeollado is fine, but in no way is it the best sushi in nyc
Everything except their house rolls are sub-par (their sushi/sashimi and the korean dishes are sad)
Their house rolls are good, though - but it's because of their cool crab meat filling
I must start by stating plainly that I love Jeollado, but it is loud, the service is bad, but the rolls are great and it is the best deal (CHEAP) in town
To all the Jeollado haters out there, try to remember not all sushi fans can eat at Nobu every weekend
Jeollado is the place for the rest of us
My friends all call me a Sushi snob (I've tried Tomoe, Nobu, and Sushi Samba and have not been impressed)
Jeollado blew me away! Rolls are SO fresh and SO cheap and it is rarity these days to find a sushi place that used REAL crabmeat- super plus!
I've been going to Jeollado for years and it's my favorite place for sushi in NYC
Every time I take someone there they are impressed with the giant and delicious rolls and the reasonable prices
I've always had great, efficient service, the owner is a very kind person and the food is addictive
The sushi is very good and it's not expensive at all
You have to try their special rolls
The place is not fancy at all so I wouldn't go there on a date
But it's a great place to just hang out with friends
A noisy place, good for groups and people new to sushi
The sushi is good, but my favorite thing here is the house green salad
My friends rave about the pancakes
I don't understand how this restaurant stays in business
I must say that my dinner there has been my worst dining experience to date
The sushi was not edible: fish was smelly (definitely NOT fresh!), rice was poorly made, the seaweed was moist and chewy like gum
The korean dishes are equally bad and lukewarm
I was so embarrassed to have brought my friend there for a going away dinner
I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone
This place used to be one of my favorite sushi spots in NYC
Together with Sandobe and West Side Sushi, this was a must for sushi lovers
The last couple of times I went there the food was awful: fish was old, seaweed was chewy, and the rice smelled bad
I am very disappointed to say this, but
so long Jeollado
After reading the negative sushi reviews, my boyfriend and I opted for their Korean fare
My Unagi Bop was bland while his Kal Bi was composed of very poor quality meat peppered with some sort of makeshift marinade
For good Korean food, stick to the eateries in Koreatown (in the thirties)
Also, they need to work on their service
Though people advised me on it's poor quality in food, I still went to see for myself
I wonder now why didn't I listen
the beef teriyaki was as moist as the sahara
The sushi was down right horrendous, the slices were warm, some were mushy, not to mention extremely fishy tasting
Which is an indication to most on how poor the quality is
The rolls were the only things that tasted decent though the size was pathetic
Being that the food is so poor, a resturant like that can only stay in business by cutting corners in the amount that they serve you
All those reviewers claiming it was the best sushi they've ever eatten must not know what quality is
If you want quality AND quantity, I would recommend any other place
Overall, let's just say after that meal my stomach is still recovering
Amazing sushi! Definitely best in town
The ice cream tempura alone is worth the trip
We love this place! Any wonder why it's always packed? Creative rolls and great tempura, I highly recommend Jeollado
The waiter messed up my order even after I called him over to checked with him
LOOK at who is making the sushi
All the raw fish are pre-cut
It is a freaking assembly line
My order came out and the fish was at room temperature
The menu said quot;real crab meatquot; but what I got was mayo w/ a few pieces of crab meat
The place smelled like a public bathroom the instant I walked in
There were flies all over the place
THIS IS A SUSHI PLACE! I will never return
This place is an absolute disgrace
The people that gave this place rave reviews do not know what SUSHI is
Though the service leaves a lot to be desired, and the waitstaff runs around like chickens without heads, the beer is cold, the sake is hot, and the sushi is out of this world! The cheap prices only add to the good time and the atmosphere is perfect for groups
And they take reservations
Who doesn't love that?
In Short No expense has been spared in simulating the look and feel of the Red Planet
Martian rock formations rise from the floor like ancient stalagmites, while a costumed cast of roaming aliens entertains the kids
Enjoy dishes like a Maine lobster and rock shrimp BLT in a sundried-tomato tortilla wrap ("Lobster Man From Mars") and a roasted pork chop with vanilla-rum mashed yams and apple chutney ("Promethean Pork Chop")
What a wonderful treat mars 2112 was! From the space shuttle trip entrance to mars, to the molecular regenerator exit to earth, it was all an exquisite dining experience
The atmosphere was very well designed, with an illuminated two story tree and a starry sky on the ceiling
There was even so much detail as shooting stars! If you want to enjoy this wonderful restaurant to the fullest, I suggest ordering 3 to 4 appetizers for a partu of 4 or more
All of the appetizers my party of 4 ordered were VERY delicious! I would reccommend the quasar quesadillas,magellan mozzerella sticks, and nebula chili nachos
They were all tasty and very satisfying
The one main thing that added to the whole experience was the 3 hilarious martian creatures roaming around the tables
Two of them came over to personally welcome us, even though they were silent martians! I even danced with Q-T-Pie, one of the martians! The only bad thing was that the third alien was so friendly and took a lot of time at the other tables, so she didn't come see us

I Trulli is by no means bad
it's just not worth what you are paying
Especially in this town of amazing italian places, i couldn't ever see going back unless it was it was on someone's company credit card
In general everything we had was *good*, but not great
Massively overpriced Italian Food
Raviolo with spinach and veal tasted like neither of the fillings - just like the butter sauce
Special of spaghetti and pancetta was good - but for $19 I could have made about 10 lbs of it at home for myself
Appetizer of smoked fish was awful - cold scallops and shrimp
Service was very poor - surprising given reviews here
Our waiter disappeared halfway through the meal and we saw him literally head out the door a few mintues later
No one cared to take his place
Go to Via Emilia or Novita - same neighborhood and much better!
Amazing food, and incredibly helpful and knowledgeable service - a really friendly place, where the food does not disappoint
I eat out 4 times a week and at various places
I don't spend over $20-$30 unless it's a significant occasion
However, I have found myself finding excuses to go back to i Trulli
I loved the food
The staff are great at making you feel relaxed and yet they always seem to be there when you need something
Once, our waiter actually talked me out of a more expensive wine because another bottle go better with our meal
The owner and his sister make you feel like you've been invited over to their house for dinner
There are some reviews complaining about the menu but I had the same dish the first three times that I was there - and any specials that I have had have been excellent
I can't say enough good things about it
If I could afford to, I'd be there four times a week!
Nice place all around
Good, attentive service
Charming, but not formal decor
Ideal place to go when it's cold outside - great fireplace
It is somewhat expensive but not outrageously so
The food was good, service great and ambience nice
A dinner experience inbetween casual and top of the line
Prices reasonable for the quality of food served
I would only go back if looking for a restaurant in THAT particular area in the city
This is a great oasis, with excellnet service great atmosphere, superb food, and servers who are knowledgable of the food and wines of Apuglia
They are also very acoomodating
this place was so romantic and wonderful
the food was so fresh and tasty
as an appetizer we had some amazing citrus shrimp and for our main courses we each got a pasta dish
so good!!! a great place to go if you like wine as well
i highly recommend the rum raisin tart for desert
yum!
Before dining at Josies I had some concerns based on the reviews here, but I enjoyed my meal there
I was seated promptly even though i didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was full
My waiter was obviously overwhelmed but was attentive and got ous our food and drinks on time
The meal was satisfying, especially the grilled tuna, and there is an interesting wine list
I think a lot of the complaints about this place are based on isolated incidents as everyone in the restaurant was having a good time and the staff was working hard
Also I think a lot of the people who lodge complaints on this site in general know nothing about the restaurant industry in New York
The food is a little overpriced though
I gave this place 3 chances and each time it got worst
The food is ok, but way over priced
The service is horrible
We waited more than a half hour for drinks, and then another half hour for the bill
The hostess/manager then accused us of being rude to her and proceeded to lecture me about MY attitude
Then the waiter sarcastically apologized for the WORST SERVICE EVER
Don't go here and waste your time and money, dining there is pure aggravation
I took my Personal-Trainer-LA-Friend to Josies because I knew she only ate healthy, light, food
The cuisine didnt disappoint! In pervious reviews many comments were made on the poor service
I, however, found our waiter to be helpful, attentive, and polite
He recommended the Thai Shrimp and Dumplings which were excellent! The portions were a nice size, and we didnt feel stuffed leaving the restaurant, just full
I would recommend Josies East to anyone looking for healthy, clean, cuisine
Lately a MISS! Wine served in an unclean glass with soap in it; mentioned it to server who did not apologize or offer a new glass - no manager came up
Went and sat at bar another time thinking maybe decent attention here nada!  Ordered in two weeks later forgot the sides and food undercooked
Tried again for Brunch and really bad server with HUGE attitude
Hello, I am the customer and would like to be treated as such, 3X you're out Josie's you're out!
I recently had the pleasure of eating at josies last week
My family and I live in Florida but were on vacation in NY; We had ended up there because of a glowing recomendation from a neighbor
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys healthy food! The staff was polite and more than gracious in regards to sevice and understanding when it came to my kids
The food itself was fresh and tasty and despite what I have read in some other reviews here
served in a acceptable amount of time
New restaurants open and close all the time but I think this one is here to stay!
We chose Josies because some of the guests in our party of 5 are vegetarians
The hostess was polite and seated us promptly even though the restaurant was full
We were a little confused about choosing a wine because of the varied meals that we ordered
The manager was walking around talking to the guests, so we asked him to help us
He recommended two of his finest wines
We were really impressed with the professionalism and kindness shown by the Manager and the staff
We had a very delightful experience and cant wait to return
Went w/ a friend on CINCO DE MAYO after we saw line to neighboring Mexican restaurant was blocks long
While the food was FABULOUS (esp the vegetarian platter, calamari appetizer and shrimp unfried rice) and they make a good mojito, it took us a LONG time to receive our food and waiter wasn't the most attentive
he asked us if we wanted dessert, before we received our entree
Would def go back though b/c of the great food/ambience (can sit outside in nice weather)
5 girls came in for dinner with a 7pm reservation
Our waitress came over and rudely interrupted one of my friends mid-sentence to make herself known
She then dropped the check down on the table without asking if anyone wanted anything else to drink ( 3 glasses were empty)
The manager then comes over to the table and asks us to leave - to help him out because there were people waiting! we had full drinks on the table! We tried to speak with him afterwards to explain that we were not finished, had eaten a whole meal with drinks and a reservation, so should be allowed to sit as long as we like
I was told that he had families with children waiting and that he was sorry but cannot talk to me any more because he has people to take care of!!
My friends and I (a group of 5 women) ate here last night
Everything was fine until we received our check without asking for it and then were basically told to wrap things up and get out because they had people waiting
2 people at the table still had full glasses of wine! The manager himself was the one who came over to us
He is an incredibly rude person who clearly does not know how to run a restaurant
The food is not good enough to warrant that kind of behavior
Needless to say we won't be back
About two minutes after my boyfriend and I were seated, our waiter asked for our order
I asked for a little more time to make a decision; apparently I should've said Could we have a few more minutes to look over the menu? But then please come back because he didn't
He took our food and drink order 15 minutes later and vanished again
We waited another 20 MINUTES without even getting our drinks! I noticed our drinks on the bar with 7 or 8 others just sitting there
Finally we got our drinks (which were warm) and shortly after that we received our food
The food was certainly not good enough to have to sit with water for 35-40 minutes
I was so disappointed with my experience here that neither we nor anyone I've told about this place will ever go there again
the food here is simply amazing
the bread and hummus dip, the seared tuna salad, the chicken stir-fry

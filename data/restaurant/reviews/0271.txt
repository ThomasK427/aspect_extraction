I visited this restaurant about a year and a half ago for my anniversary
And after arriving we waited about 3 minutes before being seated
But lucky us we had the seats by the window which was very romantic
The food was great and the wine just as nice
My girlfriend like that bottle enough that tipsy was a new feeling she learned that night
All along It was a very nice and romantic night
The hostest was very inviting and helpful
I'd come again and again
my fiancee and I went here for our celebration dinner and everything was perfect
the food was tremendous, the service was top notch and the mood was relaxed
they were very accomodating to our situation, gave us a private table in the corner
even when i knocked over a wine glass, they made no big deal of it and it was like the accident never happened
to top it off, the bill was under $125 for full dinners and two bottles of wine
Creative Italian- not your standard pasta joint
Romantic ambience, great specials, and they also create custom dishes upon request
Everything about our experience at Rafaella was wonderful
The service was simply the best we've had
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was perfect
The food and ambience are wonderful at this West Village Gem
Despite the fact the service is usually slow, if you are willing to have a leisurely night, then this is definately worth a try
It's very romantic (simple yet trendy decor, white table cloth setting and the lighting), but the waiter was very hard to find
The daily special my friend ordered was great, but my pasta dish was little too plain
Went there last weekend with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary in this very romantic, dim lit, comfy restaurant
Although we had a reservation, we had to wait 30 min, but the service turned out to be excellent
My b-friend ordered the osso buco which wasn't too good- I however had the pasta and was amazed
I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to have same great pasta- but stay away from the meat dishes
Agree with the previous reviewer on every point
Dinner here this past Saturday night was unimpressive at best
My grilled calamari app was actually pretty good, but downhill from there
The space is indeed beautiful, but I must say that I left half of my osso buco (a good test for any self-respecting Italian restaurant) on my plate as inedible - way overdone, chock full of chewy bits of gristle
The pile of brown rice it was plopped on looked and tasted like Uncle Ben's - which is fine if you're at home
We also had to pour our own wine
Hard to believe Zagat's quotes someone as saying this place is underpriced - for what you get, I beg to differ
Cabana Forest Hills, too hot
the food is great, the service good, but is a horrible experience eating with people that are sweating in from of you
When I went there the AC was not working and was a nasty experince,, you should go in winter
omg
i love this place
the food ,the people, the music, it is the real deal
I cant get enough of this place
the service is ok
but otherwise everything else is top notch
Very good place for margaritas and apps, or if you're in the mood for a good Cuban sandwich
Located in Pier 17, the restaurant is predictably filled with tourists with an occasional smattering of finance district suits taking a long lunch
Service is good depending on the server
I've had good to excellent, never bad service
The sandwiches are very good
Mojitos are good, not excellent
Overall a fun place to hang out and relax, especially on a beautiful day
CAN'T EXPLAIN YOU MUST GO AND EXPERIENCE IT! GREAT FOOD! NICE VIEWS! GREAT SERVICE! FIVE-STAR ACROSS THE BOARD!
You have to order the meat filled tostones
They are to die for
And the bacalaitos are excellent
Don't forget Ropa vieja or picadillo
It was a great mix of cuban and puertorican food
And top it all off with the view of South Street Seaport
The restaurant is big and busy of course for a Friday nite
Was turned off that the hostess didn't acknowledge my wait to be seated (no one else was in front of her) and kept talking w/ a friend who was leaving
Her co-host seemed flustered,busy and barely acknowleged me as well
After what seemed liked 10 minutes, they finally acknowledged me suddendly came alive and gave us a seat
Our waiter was extremely professional and very friendly and even gave us some recommendations
Food came quite quickly and was yummy
Seemed like the dishes were a bit too Americanized and not authentic at all but I was not complaining
Only thing I wouldn't order again was the pathetic ceviche
Everything else was great and inexpensive
Mojitos and Margritas were nice we were also recommended not to get them frozen and that was highly appreciated
It was our first time there and it was wonderful
The staff was very attentive our waitress was always on her toes all I had to do was look up and she was there
My husband who is a picky eater loved the food
Our freinds who were with us also loved
We cant wait to go back
If you're ever in the mood for a cubano and drinks, this is the place to go! Their lunch specials are delicious and not at all over priced
The cocktails are even better! Go have a few drinks, you'll have a great time
Great for large parties but make sure you make reservations!
Cabana never fails me
Love this place for the sangria, jerk chicken, garlic chicken, curry! The great view and location make it a good birthday party restaurant
My wife and I were there 7/13/2005, a Tuesday night and got there around 9:30 and sat outside
The restaurant was not crowded at all and service was great and food was great
Right there on the Seaport and from our table you can see the river as the some ships pass by
I can see this restaurant being very busy on the weekend of course
Great for drinks, alight meal or full meal
You really cannot go worng here
The view of the Seaport adds to this hot summer spot
Since they first opened I have eaten here sooooo many times that I loose count
I've eaten at all three locations and I always love, love the food, the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable
If you want good tasting, well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you can't go wrong
I think I have tried just about everything on the menu, but I always have the coconut shimp first
I took a friend for dinner for his birthday here and the food was amazing
The view of the water is beautiful too, and the overal ambiance of the place was great
Its a great place for groups and defintely a great place to have a romantic dinner too
The food portions are huge and you totally get your money's worth
Don't forget to top off you meal with the banana dessert they have here, absolutely delicious
Overall, a great experience, and highly recomended
Just came back from there, not a pleasant meal
Service was indifferent, food was mediocre
Overall feels like I am visiting another place, nothing New York about Cabana
Waitress threw napkins, forks, knives

The food was excellent and even my mother, who is incredibly hard to please, enjoyed herself
I would try the calamari as well as the lobster club which was excellent
However, the service was below average
The staff was not friendly and they were very slowly to take our orders
Our experience at this considered hot spot was very good
We thought the cocktails and the vodka selections were great, the service very friendly and the food excellent
As for the bartenders they are definetely very pretty and watch out you might spend the whole night sipping a martini
I had a new girl who had no idea what the cocktail for two was
though it was blatantly printed on the menu
When I explained it to her, she insisted that I was in error and that I should pick another
It took over 10 minutes for our drinks
Meanwhile, our server was dancing and posing by the bar
We tried to let the whole thing go but it was just one mistake after another
The wrong bottle of wine
A cup full of cocktail olives instead of our requested olive oil and vinegar
To make matters worse, when we confronted the manager, he insisted that it was not his choice to hire the girl
To cut this short, yes the girls are hot, but when you get service that bad, the place starts to look ugly real quick
'Nuff said
The food is exelent, the cocktails are good, a plus for their cocktail for 2 but the service was awfull, the worst service i ever had
they should hired people who know what they're doing
Went Fri
night on the advice of our concierage ( Thanks Anya )
The food was great
I went expecting snottiness and got great service
So shame on me
The music wasn't too loud on my visit , but we were there around 8ish so it may crank up as the bar crowd gets bigger
I only mention that because it seems to be a re-occuring theme here
I did the grilled salmon for the main course
Great Texture and taste
My wife is the Martini guru in the family and she gives 212 a big thumbs up
What a wonderful surprise 212 was last night! Went about 9:30--very busy but hostess offered to seat us immediately
We opted for the bar, where the bartender was (as has been written about 212 bartenders) beautiful, if a bit snotty
The drinks and the vodka selection was superb
The waiter, Bruno, could not have been nicer and the food! It was the best lobster I have ever had and I am from New England
We will definitely go back!
A great kickoff to a fabulous night! I took 5 friends from out of town to 212 and they loved it
Great food, great service, tasty strong drinks and a decent value
We recommend the goat cheese salad and any of the pasta dishes - yum! I recommend making a reservation
Highly recommended! The dinner food is great, been there twice in less than 2 weeks and never been disappointed with the food
Go with someone you are intimate with, as it can be quite romantic, but great for groups too, especially when catching up with friends
For guys, it's easy to get your attention diverted
so if going with female companion, face the wall (general courtesy anyway)
Best to go with a female, as I can imagine you'd feel awkward being a group of only guys
I returned to 212 for brunch and did not expect to see the place packed
In fact it was mobbed and i decided to have my french toast and my omelete at the bar
I did not feel bad not to be sat in the dining room since Mayor Guiliani was waiting for a table!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I recently reserved the private room at 212 for one of our corporate meeting and must say 212 is one of the best place in Manhattan
From my telephone inquiry to the end of our event the service was extremely courteous and the food well presented
I was really impressed
I LIVE DOWNTOWN AND WAS INVITED TO 212 LAST WEEK
GOING ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE FOR US NORMALLY IS AN UNPLEASNT EXPERIENCE
UPTIED SUIT GUYS WITH THEIR PREPPY WANT TO BE SEX AND THE CITY CHEEKS
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OUR FRIENDS TOLD US 212 WAS COOL AND WE WILL LIKE IT
WELL IT WAS AMAZING
DRINKS, FOOD AND AMBIANCE
THE PRICE OF THE DRINKS ARE HIGH BUT I GUESS IT'S NORMAL UPTHERE
IF THOSE 212 GUYS WERE GONNA OPEN DOWNTOWN IT WILL THE HOTEST SPOT DOWNTOWN
Just moved in nearby and noticed 212 outdoor
We decided to have a quick bite around 7 pm and got a table outside
The place started to fill up and got packed real fast
The quick bite we planed on move on to meeting some hot girls who were seating next to us
we actually left 212 at 11 pm
hammered
we had such a great time that we returned for brunch the next day and it was also amazing
we had great eggs benedict and no boose
My boyfriend and I went to 212 with a couple of friends and had a memorable experience
We started at the bar with a round of mojitos, which were amazing, and went to our reserved table
We ordered some tuna roll, some crispy calamari and the calamari salad that we all shared
it was simply devine
We then had the veal milanese (definetely the best in NYC), the organic chicken and the gnocchi and everything was really perfect
For desserts the waiter recommended the crepes with nutella and the dulce de leche ice-cream as well as the chocolate souffle
unbelievable
For a place that is trendy and full of beautiful people the food was really amazing and the service was very professional
212 is definetely up there in the top 5 restaurants in NYC
Join some friends for brunch on sunday
Service was spectacular
The french toast with mixed berry was light and delicious, just the right amount of sweetness
French fries were crisp and the burger the best i had in a long time
My highest recommendation for a place to have a great brunch and enjoy each other's company especially on a nice afternoon if you lucky to sit outisde
No restaurant in new york comes close to this place! food is amazing, cocktails fantastic,service professional and a well priced menu
The atmosphere is fun and exciting and i cant wait to go back
212 has been one of my favorite for years as the place is always upbeat with new cocktails,new vodkas and new dishes
The staff is very professional and knowledgeable and the bartenders are the best in town
We went to 212 for drinks and decided to stay for dinner
We did not know the food was also great especially the veal milanese
big and tasty and the tilapia fish
We also shared a dessert the chocolate souffle that was recommended by our waitress and it was unbelievable
As for the service it was very friendly and professional
The experience overall was fun but it'scrowded
The food was ok
average at best
The waitstaff was actually the worst I've experienced
didn't bring someone's food until 20 min after everyone else and acted annoyed when we kept reminding them
Apparently they can't handle large groups for dinner
Not only the food was great but the service was also fantastic
Great hostess, knowledgeable service and gorgeous bartenders
212 is simply the best restaurant i have been this year
Being from out of town our concierge recommended 212 as a hot spot with good food
Once there we were definetely impressed as the place was packed with beautiful people

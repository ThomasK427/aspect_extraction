The food was sub par, and it was a bit overpriced
I was really hoping for a good neighborhood spot, this isn't it
wonderful evening! i brought a group of people after work for margaritas and nachos at the bar
people wound up ordering dinner, and it was great to have everthing from salads and filet mignon on the menu
the atmosphere was fun and cozy
and it didn't break the bank
definitely will come back
My wife and I stopped by for a couple of martinis and were so pleased with the menu that we decided to stay
The sea bass was wonderful, as were the starters and chocolate bread pudding
And I had a terrific salmon dish
A really nice surprise in the neighborhood
I live a block away from Dano, and go there a few times per month for dinner, or meet up with people for drinks there
Saturday evenings are a good time to go, and brunch on Sunday is really good
Great wine selection, and friendly staff
I highly recommend Dano!
Granted, I'm not an expert on soul food (this was probably the first time I've eaten it), but I thought everything here was really delicious!! The okra was probably my favorite
Very tasty
Second is the chicken smothered in gravy, the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese
I don't normally like mac cheese, but this stuff was good
The sweet potatoes weren't really to my liking
I think I'm not used to that spice they put in it
Probably the best part of this restaurant was the guy behind the counter
He was so helpful
He even let us taste the side dishes because we were undecided on them
The ambience isn't 5-star, but I think it really suits the place
Loved it!! Definitely going back again
The establishment may not have much of an interior or have the greatest service but it sure does crank out some of the best southern comfort food I've had in the city
The meatloaf with a bit of honey on it is to die for, the macaroni and cheese is fresh and delicious, and the cornbread is a house favorite
A definite hidden spot from the rest of Manhattan, hope it doesn't become overly crowded like some other hot spots
Me and some of my co workers were in the mood for some Soul food and I checked this website out to get some reviews on some places
Soul Fixins got a lot of great reviews and after trying there food today, I say they definitely deserve the praise
Now, I can't tell u how the restaurant and ambiance is because this was a delivery but the food was DELICIOUS
Soul Fixins JUUUST became my new Soul Food spot! :)
Despite the post below, I just moved here from Virginia, and I thought that the food was quite authentic
Everything that I had was fresh, moist, and perfectly seasoned
The meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, collards, and green beans were particularly delicious
Their friendly and helpful service, reasonable prices, and generous portions will keep me coming back for more
(And they deliver!)
I'm perplexed by the rave reviews
Either people haven't been down South or were glad to see an eatery in an empty area
As someone from GA, I felt the sides were mediocre at best, and not seasoned authentically at all
I give props to their fish only since it's something they cook fresh
Good size servings, but the price isn't worth the quality or service
This is a no-table-service cafeteria-style shop with most items premade for you to point-select
Although most Southern dishes must be premade, their food was dry from sitting in the trays
Not much to say about the counter people's service since they just plate the food and hand it over, but I suppose they aren't needlessly rude
Overall, if you're in the neighborhood and need a quick bite, fine, but if you're looking for real and good Southern food, this is not worth your trip
I saw Soul Fixins' on Foodtv and decided to give it a try
The store is a small place but the food is amazing! The candied yams are soo sweet, chicken and dumplings are yummy
The price is very reasonable
The only con about the place is that it doesn't have enough tables so it gets crowded very easily
I've been there twice so far and plan to go back for more
This is one of the best soul food places in the city! The mac n cheese speaks for itself, and being a regular I always go for the smothered chicken and greens! Potato salad is the bomb as well! Try it and you'll love it as much as everyone else on here! Not much seating but the food is worth waiting to sit or get take out!
There isn't any word to describe how tasty the food is
I had the fried whiting with macaroni and cheese, and my beau had smothered chicken and greens
The helpings were so plentiful that we could barely walk out of there
and DELICIOUS!
Soul Fixin's has the ambience of a college-town coffeehouse and the lard-soaked ecstasy of a home-cooked meal in the deep South
The meatloaf and chicken are always amazing, but what makes this place truly special are the sides
I don't know what the secret ingredient in the collard greens is, but they were phenomenal
Awesome home cookin'
I had Mac n Cheese, Meatloaf and Rice and Peas; my husband had the Catfish and the best yams either of us have ever had
Everything was great, the staff friendly and my compliments to the chef
Been here a couple of times
The staff is very friendly and accomodating
Prices are reasonable ($4
50 for Coors Light) and the food menu is very good
There are numerous tv's around the bar, most of them showing soccer if at all possible, but most of them aren't that big
Locale is a little out of the way though
Other than that, not much to complain about
Its a perfect afterwork environment
The food is ok, but the barstaff makes up for it!!!! Hottie Steven and Hottie Darren!!!! woo hoo!
This place made us feel like we were in a small town in Italy - great food, terrific service, quaint and cozy all at a reasonable price
The orecchiecte pasta with carbonara sause is a must have!
chose this restaurant because a friend lives nearby and we wanted to find something close
upon entering, i saw that the bar area was packed and the dining area was close to packed as well
i told the hostess that my other two guests were not present at the time and she said that was fine
they arrived 40 minutes later, but i never got any dirty looks from the staff at all
the food was great (i had that night's special which was ravioli stuffed with lobster and crabmeat) and i even sent back a glass of cabernet in exchange for a shiraz and received no complaints
the staff was friendly and joked with us, as seeing we were friendly
the tiramisu and tartufo was so good!!! i highly recommend this place
After living in Argentina for four months, I never thought I would find gnucci that good in the states--but buon gusto proved me wrong
All of their food is delicious
Even my father loved it, and nothing ever matches up to the italian food grandma used to make
The food does take a while to come but good food takes a while
Plus, it is a great value
I highly regret the time I wasted on Cafe Buon Gusto
The staff was discourteous, it took the food forever to arrive, and when it finally did arrive, it was not worth the time it took
Save yourself and go enjoy your Italian dinner elsewhere
First of all, I never thought that I would find reasonable priced Italian food in Chelsea
The quality of food is outstanding, especially for the price
The pasta is homemade with mom size servings
I've tried 3 of the sauces and all have exceeded my expectation
delish!!! Pesto is my favorite
The best part is that they deliver with the same quality as eating there
Atmosphere is intimate, not too crowded not to trendy
Love the wine list, simple but perfect for the atmosphere
Once again, inexpensive but not cheap
The bar is never really crowded but seems like a good place to hang out w/ your friends
Overall really like this place and will keep coming back

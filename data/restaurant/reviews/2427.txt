The waitstaff was very helpful and eager to please, and the food was excellent
From the decor to the food presentation, the whole place is a conversation piece
Great for entertaining
Went there for my birthday
Got there early for a 9pm reservation and was seated right away
Restauarant staff extremely friendly attentive, which is rare these days in the city
Appetizers delicious, only wish they'd give more per serving
Main course delicious
And surprisingly the desert menu was good, got the chocalate mouse cake
Will definitely go back again with a larger group
and the plus to the evening was dining next to Sara Jessica parker and hubby Matthew Broderick
Excellent and delicious
You gotta try this place if you haven't already, but then again, who hasn't? Returning customers know what they're getting and thus, it's no wonder they've lasted for over 20 years! Keep it up!
The Scene From the outside, it's hardly worth a pause
But head inside Cafe Mozart for a sudden jaunt to a European cafe--not the too-perfect Disneyfied version, but a lived-in, cozy spot where you can settle in for an afternoon with the paper
Votives on every table cast a golden glow on plain wooden tables and chairs
Live piano music (nightly and at Sunday brunch) is a welcome backdrop to the din of clinking glasses and conversation
Outside tables are available in warm weather
The Food Dessert is the forte here, with more than 65 caloric selections including chocolate mousse cake, creme brulee, French apple tart and raspberry cheesecake
But the dinner menu is solid, and includes two prix-fixe options
Wonderfully gooey French onion soup and herb-roasted chicken offer deep comfort
The sirloin is served with addictive fries
Breakfast and lunch are also available
This is a great place to go on a date or with friends
The candlelight and live classical music gives it a warm atmosphere, and the dessert is to DIE for
The dessert menu is at least 4 pages
I had the warm chocolate souffle cake with strawberries and whippedcream and I loved it
Desserts are $7-12 but I think they're worth it
The only drawback was slow service, but the food and ambience are so nice that your wait is A) pleasant and B) worth it
we've been going to mozart for years--and I love the salads
Don't miss the salmon or goat cheese pies
I was surprised, however, when I recently ordered dessert and my strudel was served to me tasting of freezer burn
I asked a couple of my friends to taste to be sure--and they, too, gagged at the chemical taste
When we approached the manager for it to be taken off of our bill, he refused--saying that more than a mouthfull had been eaten
How sad I am to give one of our former places to be such a review
Perhaps they have changed management in the recent months--but if you go for dessert--stick to this rule of thumb? What you see is generally what you get in the view case
Stay away from anything you can't visually attest to
I don't have anything bad to say and I am very surprised about the bad comments I read
This place is without a doubt one of my favorite spots to go to late at night
Love the desserts, the coffee, the food, the people, love it love it love it! You should really go to this cute cafe someday cuz everything about is awsome!
The moment I walked in the door I knew it was gonna be a great night
For some reason the hostess knew exactly who I was meeting there, took me to my table and told us our waitress would be right with us
Sure enough, ten seconds later our waitress came over with the nicest smile I've ever seen
We started our meal with the goat cheese tarts, then I had the salmon Avacado salad and my date had the chicken shnitzel
WOW
both looked great! We were stuffed but how could we say no to dessert? So we had the forest fruit tart and the svegliamisu it was like we were in heaven
This was by far one of the best dates I've ever been on and I think everything played a part
The hostess was nice, my waitress was fabulous and the desserts were to die for
Great restaurant
Well last year my friends brought me here for my birthday
and anyone who has been to Cafe Mozart knows what I'm talking about
First of all the food is indescribable though the french fries are my favorite! Then come the desserts
Oh my God
incredible
You've got to experience the heaven of Cafe Mozart
They've got so many different kinds of desserts
Weather you like chocolate or tarts or cheesecake and even ice cream
they have it all!! And the dessert presentation is Fantastic! I love it there
The food was wonderful, the service really bad
My friend ordered a salad, and asked for goat cheese instead of roquefort
The salad arrived -- roquefort
The waitress took it back -- no apology -- and we waited over 20 minutes for the right dish
I asked that my leftover chicken be wrapped up
it was thrown away, again, no apology, just a clear indication that WE were causing trouble
I know a restaurant can be a hectic place, but geez, could they have pretended to be nice? That's a lot of attitude to take, especially at those prices
Never again
went there on 2/9/06 for my hubby's bday
since we're informed its service isslow we had dinner in midtownwent for dessertb-day thing
had reservation in advance told hostess we were there for bday as i walked in
But that message wasn't carried to our waiter
desserts came out nothing happened
they suggested to order an extra cake to bring out with a bday music do all that
so i did, though i had enough desserts
after all it wasnt impressive -cake w/ cancel with classical bday song
dirty looking wig and bad quality photo weren't great
I wish waiters sang at least
it was quick i was embarrassed to bring everybody all the way there for this
dessert is ok, not special
i like the setting but don't expect much for b-day
oh, we got a piece of chocolate as a gift
We just went there for a friend's birthday and had a great time
They put a mozart wig on the birthday girl, put a sparkler her dessert and sang happy birthday
The cutest part was that they took a picture while everyone was singing and printed a card out from restaurant with the picture included and a little gift of chocolates
In general, the wait is long and the wait staff isn't very pleasant but its a great dessert place if you have a few hours to spend
It's not alwqys easy to find a great place to JUST grab a dessert, but Cafe Mozart fits the bill
a bit on the pricey side, but with a number of delectible dishes to choose from on the dessert menu, it was worth it
$7
50 minimum (and max of 2 hrs to hang out at a table) on a Friday/Saturdaynight didn't feel like too much of a burden, and I'd go back to enjoy a cappucino and read the paper on an idle Saturday
Sometimes we want to go some place very nice and quiet
This is the place which I can feel Europe
Waiters are nice too
Very good restaurant with atmaosphere
Be able to forget we are in NY
Desserts are good too
I first stumbled upon this cozy cafe when i was 16 and playing a series of concerts at Lincoln Center and ever since, through undergrad and graduate school have continued to introduce it to friends and they all LOVED it
Everyone then makes it a find of their own ad shows someone knew
I always have expediate service, great food, good wine, and AB FAVulous desserts
A MUST SEE!!
They have a great brunch here
30 bucks for 2 with a nice made omletttttttttte and some pooooched eggs

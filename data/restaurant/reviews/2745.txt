Not only does San Marcos have a slice worth traveling for (the sauce makes the pizza, lip-smacking good) but everything here seems to be exactly what you are looking for, chicken parmesans are flooded with cheese, pizza crust is perfect, salads are fresh!  The individual size pizzas are the perfect mid-point between a regular pie and a gourmet pizza
For a special treat for your tastebuds, order the shrip parm hero double its $14 but so worth it!!!
straight from Teggiano, these guys make THE best pizza! Their Sicilian slice is awesome
The calzones and sandwiches are great too
Oh yeah, they make a great grilled chicken salad too!
I finally went in there, and now I order food once a week
Its the real deal
The penne vodka is amazing! Everything is prepared to order and is fresh, so it can take a little while, I suggest picking up
TRY IT
the prices have gone up slightly over the past couple years but the pizza is still some of the best in the city and is very hard to pass up when coming home from a night out
the chicken slice and the pesto slice are amazing and worth the money
truly a great piece of the neighborhood that continues to be easy and unpretentious despite everything else that has happened
When you get off the L train on Bedford Ave
, be sure to hit this great pizza joint, which specializes in unique and tasty combinations
The sauce is fantastic, the ingredients fresh
Plenty of goodies for vegetarians, too
The plain slice is a bit pricey for what you get sometimes, but the pre-made multi-topping slices are a bargain at $3 a pop
Get lots of napkins and tell them two plates; can be a bit greasy at times, too
Great pizza and heros, without the variety and selection of that star wars-style canteena hipster crowd pizzeria on Bedford (Anna Maria's) but with 5X the flavor
All the slices at Anna Maria's taste the same, no matter how many inane toppings they pile on it
Driggs has real Brooklyn pizza and behind the counter is the requisite Italian football club team pictures and whatnot
That's almost enough to prove its legitimacy to me, but eating there, both for a quick slice and sit-down for pasta with my family has always been a delicious, inexpensive and fun experience
That's the real proof
Great food with a great man behind it, Antonio is the nicest guy who always comes out to greet his customers and say hello and thank you
The entres are fantastic, feel like I am back in Palermo
The pizza is forget about it!!!!!!! This does beat any pizza I have
I've only ordered delivery or take-out from Carmine's, and I've only had the pizza, but only because its so damn good!! Delivery can be a bit slow (sometimes up to or just over an hour), but the pizza is so good its worth the wait :)
Carmine's used to be the best local pizza but it's now a great small family restaurant
Some of the food is the Italian American red-sauce variety - fine if you're stuck in the past, but, there are also a number of very good, far more authentic Italian items at most reasonable prices
Best of all, you just feel at home, comfortable, unrushed and among friends
I order from Carmine's weekly! Food is amazing
Authentic! It's a Pizza joint
but a really really good one! The pizza is so good, specialty pizzas are great
And the Chicken Rollatini and marsala are sooooo good!! They deliver and take credit cards!!
Having visited Carmine's Pizzeria on numerous occasions I feel pretty confident in saying that this establishment has provided me and several of my friends with some of the best of the borough food
from the sandwich wraps and hot italian dishes to the creative pizzas
Carmine has included it all and he and his courteous staff have kept me coming back
You don't know what you are missing until you've had Soul Food Kitchen
The Restaurant has that real back home taste that keeps you going back
GOOD FOOD at a very GREAT PRICE
I highly reccommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner
What can i say I have eaten bagels all over NYC and nothing comes even close
Worth a drive from anywhere in the metro area
If you really love bagels, tasy should not be missed!
I live nearby and know the Bakery well
Too many times the cakes pastries are too old to sell or eat yet they still sell it
They admit to freezing items or having a problem with the sun heating up the items in the window yet they deny anything is wrong with them
If you dont like someone, buy them a cake from West End Bakery
Just dont eat it
Great prices, great food, great service
A throwback to the 50's or so
wonderful!
Nice quiet place
Good food, but they could expand their desert menu
I loved their brick oven pizza, but my friends and my kids didnt
The pasta was excellent, too
Highly recommend their cappuccino
Unfortunately, they dont have many deserts to go with it
I'm from Italy and i felt home great and fresh food ,good pizza,i been there few times and i always go with the special or seafood, about dessert try the profitterol
the only bad think is not really a romantic place so if you want to have very good food and you are not on a firsth date go!!!!!!
I'm a softy for Italian food, so one day searching through Citysearch, we found Casa Calamari
The reviews for this place seemed so positive but once we got there, we had no expectations
The ambiance was non existant! We went in, got seated next to the window next to a hanging advertisment
and gave each other looks like wow, the reviews do not tell the whole story
Our minds were changed once a waiter popped over to take our order
The warmest service you will ever get anywhere! You can tell the waiter was exhausted by the weekend dinner crowd
it was 9pm when we got there
and he still kept his upbeat personality to make our experience amazing! The food was to die for
i have eaten a lot of italian food
and this is definately in my top 5 experiences! Awesome awesome place!
We love this place
The food is good old fashioned home cooking like Grandma's house
Their pizza is better than any of the other famous brick oven places in NY
We go there often and highly recommend it
The Brick Oven Pizza was the best we ever tasted and we have had it all over NYC
This place is not to be missed
Seafood and other dishes are great too
Fresh ingredients
A great Family neighborhood restaurant
Casa Calamari is a great restaurant for really good food at low prices
It's amazing how the prices are so low and yet the food so good
It's not a fancy restaurant but instead down to earth and comfortable
Besides ordering single dishes you can also order family style
The service was also good
I brought my family here who told me Good Choice!
We definitely look forward to a return visit
Casa Calamari is also good for groups and is kid-friendly
My nieces had a fun time drawing on the table cloths
My husband took me here when we first started dating five years ago, we now go at least once a week with our daughter and we are treated just like family, I felt like this since the first time i walked into this restaurant
The staff is unbelivable and on sat nights the entertainment is Great
Espically Cuban Pete, my three year old loves him
The food is the best, it taste just like the it came out of my grandmothers kitchen, it reall italian home cooking
Go to the original on bath ave
My family and I use New Ruan's more for take out and delivery than to eat in the restaurant
The restaurant is very nice, but it is easier to have them deliver on a Friday night
They are very prompt with delivery too
Their food is delicious and they send you cut up oranges to cleanse your palate after dinner which is a very nice touch
This past Friday night we had their sweet and spicy soup which was just delicious
So was the orange chicken, shrimp and chicken with broccoli and their fried rice and lo mein is the best

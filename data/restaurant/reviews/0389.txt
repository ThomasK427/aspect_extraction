The door to go downstairs was offensively pretentious
On a very sparse Fri night for Suba, the girl at the door proceeded to tell 2 couples that she would need to run a credit card for $80 before she could let us downstairs @ 3 am (to ?make sure we bought the minimum of drinks?)
That amount dropped to $40 before we turned around, but just the notion of running a card to let customers into a (half-empty) spot is offensive - doubly offensive in the Lower East Side! We walked
A tough door is fine, but a door with a blatant nonrefundable deposit for drinks is absurd and offensive
We hope Suba can find less offensive ways to pay its bills
Treat people right with a great setting like Suba and the cash should rain on them
Get your minds right, Suba management, please
Celebrated my birthday here
Since it was a trendy place I booked 4 weeks ahead for party of 8
The booking was a little complicated
credit card in advance people couldn't join in for dessert, phone calls not returned very quickly
However when we got there, the staff and owner were very nice and flexible
A friend was dieing for chorizo but it was only in the tapas menu which we couldn't have
The owner made an exception and brought it down
They really went out of their way to make our birthday celebration a good one
Will definately come back! The food was out of this world and the drinks
wow!
NICE COZY SPOT BUT ,THE GROTTO ROOM WOULD BE A LOT MORE ROMANTIC IF IT WAS JUST QUIETER AND CALMER DOWN THERE
OVERALL THOUGH, A NICE PLACE TO EXPERIENCE
Original tapas menu
complimentary tapas when you order a drink
great music
good looking crowd
Suba's got a great recipe for a great night out
Wonderful decor, water all around dark with candles
The food was good the prochutto, goat cheese and tuna tower was a taste to remember, calamari was good as well, I thought the appetizers were better than the main dishes
Portions are small and a bit pricey the food came extreamly quick! too quick in fact, didnt have a chance to enjoy my wine and enjoy the chit chat
Service was good, the plus was that there is a man walking around making sure we didnt have to pour our own wine
Cool design! Best mojito in New York
Food was original in the romantic water room
Girlfriend and I loved the HOT Latino dancing after dinner
If you're looking for a tapas bar, which is how they advertise themselves, do yourselves a favor and look elsewhere
Their two main dining areas don't offer them
You can only order taps if you sit upstairs near the bar in an overcrowded, impersonal, un-diner friendly atmosphere
And what they consider a lounge is a plain rectangular room only offering bottle service
My friends and I were allowed to stay at the diminutive bar and were barely finished with our drinks before the bouncer asked us to leave
NYC is a big place and I am not coming back here
Suba is by far the worst restaurant I have been to in the last year
The food left a bad taste in my mouth
My dining partener was very disgusted with his dish
Also note: The moat smelled!
Never go to a restaurant purely for it's looks
The food has to be atleast decent if it deserves a visit
That said, Suba is highly overrated
While the lovely pool of water was a wonderful addition to the scenery here, the food was quite miserable and overpriced
If you want to eat by the water, go grab a picnic basket and take a trip to Central Park
Both my friend and I had horrible meals, and the worst part was the popcorn in the salad
Suba was fantastic! Stunning space, suprisingly good food, great service and reasonably priced
I picked it for a friend's birthday party not having been before, so I was taking a risk, but I was glad I did - as was everyone else
I could see how the scene might overwhelm the staff on weekend nights, so you might actually be better off going earlier in the week
Live flamenco on Sunday nights is something I'm definitely going to check out, however
Highly recommended
PS Churrasco skirt steak was excellent
With a cool decor and fabulous drinks good food in a happening part of town, it is most unfortunate that the service was dismal every step of the way
From seating (we had a reservation) to taking our order to dealing with a check dispute, it was a disappointing experience
I went on a Thursday evening with a friend without reservations
We were told the wait would be 30 minutes, so we ordered a drink at the bar
As soon as I took a sip of my drink, we were told our table was ready
I hate this annoying make them think they have to wait so they'll buy drinks thing
Ugh! The crusty bread with olive oil was good
I had the skirt steak, which was very salty and overdone
The string breans and potatoes were not great, and also salty
They tasted like diner homefries
The snapper pieces came on rounds of potatoes
Aslo pretty mediocre
Nothing exciting for dessert, but the standards
fruit type things and the ubiquitous warm chocolate cake
Not worth trying
Food was incredible
Music was wonderful
Decor was sexy
And most importantly, the women were gorgeous!
had a great time at Suba last night
The interior space is amazing (suprised we havent seen it in a rap video yet)
The food was quite good and the service was on par
We had to wait a bit to get our table (which didnt seem right for a thurs night), but no complaints afterwards
Cocktails a bit price and as usual NYU-glam, meal portions were small
But overall, had a pleasurable expereince
Great date place
its in the middle of nowhere in LES
The bar area is subpar, but when you go downstairs, you will be glad you came! Bravo!
So nice to find a place where you can have a high quality late night meal, listen to some really good music, enjoy many cocktails, and be surrounded by a good looking crowd
I ate very late last Saturday (12:00 AM or so), and then went straight into the skylight room (where the DJ plays) for one of the best late night scenes I've found in a long, long time
Worth going to just for the amazing atmosphere downstairs
The food fell short of the room, too bad
The cocktails were creative, but they weren't very good
Still, go just to see the space once, don't know if I will go again though
For my friends informal birthday gathering of 15-20 of her closest, (I was going for an extraordinary environment to reflect how I feel about my friend one that would somehow come with an unflappable staff), Subas tapas lounge was the perfect setting
Check out their web site for how gorgeous this space is (imagine it warmer; web shots dont do it justice)
What I will tell you about is the comfortable seating we were invited to commandeer (on a Saturday night no less), the excellent service this lovely woman, consistently patient and genial with our rotating crew and the inherent unwieldiness of a large group (while the rest of the lounge was packed); and Phil (owner) who gave me a chance to bring the word gracious back into my vocabulary clearly the designers of Suba were going for a reflection of Phils sense of hospitality and elegance
Had new years eve dinner here w/my girlfriend
Romantic atmosphere, good food, thought the water around the 'moat room' was very cool
We had a pre-fix menu, and it was new years so ofcourse I paid too much, but the desserts were amazing, (this coming from a beer and pizza guy)
If I'm ever single again, this is a great 'date' place, just get reservations in the room surrounded by water
Food was excellent, the service was wonderful, very attentive staff
Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and totally impressed her
Our waitress, Kathryn accomodated our requests and made us feel totally comfortable
The ambience of the water-room is fantastic, the food was delicious, and the desserts, fabulous
The flamenco dancers were a nice addition to the evening (only Sunday)
I would highly recommend this resturant/lounge to anyone wanting for a romantic night out

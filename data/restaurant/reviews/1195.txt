Best burgers and curly fries in the area, super-friendly and helpful waitstaff, nice fun casual atmosphere
and enough options on the menu to suit any taste! The helpings are more than generous - they pour the biggest cup of coffe I've ever seen - and everything on the menu is good, home-style cooking
I've never once been disappointed! (And they have free delivery - excellent!) Perfect place for a meal before a trip to the Museum of the Moving Image or a movie at the Kaufman-Astoria
My husband and I love this place for its atmosphere and its friendly service
We have been there for both lunch and dinner and have enjoyed it
The menu is simple and it also has changed over the year to make it more exciting
My hubby LOVES his cup of Jose
It is a great place to relax after work
Not too boring or yuppified like other places in this up and coming neighborhood
I have lived in Astoria all my life and this is a nice little addition to the area
One problem is parking is sometimes difficult
The menu is confused
I dont know what they were thinking
Have been here for dinner and breakfast
The portions are like a buffett for breakfast
TOO MUCH THAT IT IS GROSS! Dinner, there is nothing that eye-catching
have been here few times to support a friend, but not my choice of venue
Good Restaurant and Great New addition to Astoria
Most dishes are very YUMMY and a very good value
The only complaints are that the PANCAKES yes pancakes seem to be the only bad thing on the menu
Chef tried to get too fancy with these
AND, the waitstaff likes to lick its fingers when cutting cakes/pies and serves hot and cold drinks by holding the glass or cup around the brim/top
Not something you want to see in the place you are dining
They are friendly though and the atmosphere is good
Management should correct these few problems though - as they are deal-breakers to many
Been here twice so far and both times it has been a pleasant experience
The waitstaff was very friendly even after requesting a different beverage --and the food was very good
The Ambience is ok
It's not my favorite type of atmosphere but I can see how a lot of people would like it--big-industral feel mixed in with old school 50s diner appeal
Booths are more comfy than tables (like everywhere else)--and the place has many drinks to choose from due to the in house bar
See it becomming one of my favorite late night spots to grab a bite to eat
i went to cup 3 times in a month and a half time period
the place looks cool, but the food is not really that good
first time i went there, they messed up my gf's order
second time, i got my omlette filled with unmelted cheese
third time i went with a group of people
they messed up the orders so badly that half of the table didn't eat what they got because it was so bad
after waiting 40 minutes for our food, they didn't even compensate us for the meals that weren't eaten
every time i went there, i was in there for at least 30 minutes before i got my food
all 3 times it was a simple saturday afternoon brunch
i highly suggest avoiding this terrible place
My husband and I really enjoyed our Friday night meal here
It wasn't quite a date atmosphere - more like a group-of-friends sort of place
But the portions were huge, the decor and atmosphere was bustling and cool, adn the service was prompt and friendly
Avoid the cupcakes, though, they weigh a ton!
I thought I would try this out since it's close to where I live and the reviews were ok
Unfortunately I tried it for the first time on a Friday night
the wait for a table was very short but then we were ignored for quite a while
I got one of their famous 12 oz
burgers and it was way to dry and over cooked
But the service was friendly and the portions big
Nice place to go mid day for lunch, but i would skip the busy dinner hour if I were you
My partner and I went yesterday with a friend of ours and were really impressed
First of all, the place is HUGE! It's like walking into a place anywhere but in the 5 boroughs
The tables are pretty far from one another, the food was great (and a great value!) and the waitstaff was attentive and quick
We will definitely be back there again soon!
We went to CUP last night
As we were being seated my friend asked for a booth and the hostess said I cannot sit you there its for 3 or more
As I just glanced at the empty booths and booths filled with only 2 patrons she sarcastically said and I quote You may see only two people sitting there, but I am not going to sit you there because its not right, its just not right! she then proceeded to sit couples in the booths for the rest of our time there
Too weird for me
The waitress was nice though
I've been to Cup twice, both times after visiting the American Museum Of The Moving Image right across the street, and have been impressed enough to wish I had a place like that in Williamsburg, where I live
Granted, we have similar retro-chic restaurants over in W'Burg, but few are as neighborhood-friendly (in terms of service) and as wallet-friendly (in terms of food quality)
Cup definitely seems less of a diner than just a great hip neighborhood restaurant without the pretensions of a hipster joint
Service is efficient and super friendly, and the food is really great - I recommend the steak au poivre and buffalo chicken wings! It's a bit of a jaunt if you don't live in the immediate neighborhood, but I can't wait to be back
Whether you live in Astoria or not, you must go to the Cup Diner
What a fanstastic addition to the neighborhood
The food, first, is wonderful
Must have the fried calamari, the Astoria potpie and the steak au poivre
Desserts, also are amazing, especially the apple pie and banana cream
The staff is so friendly and the price is right, even on alcohol (oh, the sangria is the best in NYC)
I also love the decor - very open space, very clean and retro 50's meets hip diner chic
I will be back again and again
In Short Patrons are marked with a stamp of approval upon entry into the subterranean space
DJ Dove reigns over the intimate rooms, offering plush seating, curved lines and pan-Asian cuisine to nonmembers with a heavy wallet
Those willing to pay $800 a year for membership gain access to the rear lounge and priority seating in the sushi room
Menu options include sweet soy lacquered New York squab, pan roasted wild striped bass, sushi rolls and crispy white chocolate ravioli
There is not another place like Frederick's in New York City
My boyfriend did not like sushi when we first dined at Frederick's over a year ago
Since then, he cannot get enough of their salmon roll, and spicy tuna roll
In addition, the short ribs are outrageous! It is the perfect reprieve after shopping at Bergdorf's
They have ladies night every Thursday and ladies drink for free from 5-9 pm- great crowd! We also hang out there late at night instead of going to the over crowded Meatpacking district
It is an upscale crowd- and they have some of the wildest parties! The staff too deserves a mention- super friendly, and SEXY!! This is definitely a restaurant/lounge to visit for any occassion, at ANY time!!
I had the pleasure of attending Frederick's for the first time a few months ago and have returned several times since
On each occasion I have come early to eat and ended up staying late to party
The food and drink is phenomenal, the staff is friendly (not to mention gorgeous), and the crowd is always top notch
The short ribs, spicy tuna, and salmon avacado are personal favorites, but I have yet to be disappointed by a menu item
After dinner the music is just as fresh as the sushi, and there are plenty of attractive guests to dance with
A rest/lounge at its best!
One of the few civilized nightlife venues left in this city
My dinner last week at Frederick's was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a very long time
The sushi was fresh, and uniquely prepared
The white soy sauce was remarkable
Very light and complimented the fish wonderfully
The yellow tail sashimi was delicious
My entree was the slow baked cod fish which was also splendid
The lychee martini was one of the best in NYC as well
As always, the Sancerre was great too! Overall a perfect 10!
i was suprised to get in, because everybody said that it is private and it is not
they just have a small room in the back that is private, for their members

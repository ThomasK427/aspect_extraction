For one thing, it's a couple dollars cheaper and MUCH less crowded, which is always a bonus
But really, the main reason to go here is the food
Each time I've been here, I've gotten to try something new and unusual, though they do have the ubiquitous makhani, tandoori and curry
Their naan is brought fresh to your table
The palak paneer and tawa chicken are the best I've had ANYWHERE
I haven't been back to the Jackson Diner since I found this place - it's really THAT good!
We went to Indian Taj on Monday after the fireworks, even though it was late and almost closing time the people there were very pleasent and didn't mind our crowd of 8 people just bursting in for the buffet
There were so many dishes to choose from, my favorite was the palak paneer and the fresh bread and dessert
The food was spectacular as the fireworks!!!
In Short This spacious Indian restaurant in Queens' Jackson Heights enjoys great popularity among natives and non-natives alike, and not just because it's right by the subway: its welcoming, colorful main dining room is the focus of many pilgrimages to Queens from Manhattan
Items like spicy masala dosa, a host of lamb and goat entrees, and fried appetizers like samosas and pakoras are complemented by milder southern Indian dishes and refreshing lassis
The food was okay, service was non-existent, and bathrooms were silly, with anti-Bush grafiti
It was a nice, gigantic diner
I wouldn't go there again
Too expensive
You could get the same stuff for a lot cheaper on Curry row in Manhattan
I've been going to the JD since it used to be a diner
I've had tastes there that I've never had anywhere else
Since it became discovered I think the quality has suffered a bit but it is still among the best Indian restaurants I've ever eaten at
This is one of the few places I'll venture out of Manhattan just to eat their Sunday buffet
While the prices have just recently risen to $9
95, it remains a reasonable price for all that you get
Always a treat, the butter chicken, palak paneer, and goat curries are sensational, while the tandoori, samosas, and chana aloo are a bit dry
You'd expect one to have more dessert options, other than rice pudding
One thing that is great is there is a pitcher of water at each table, great for people who can't handle the spices
The decor is among the funkiest if not some of the most peculiar ambiance I've seen in an Indian establishment
The service is so-so at best and the most inconvenient is the inability to use credit cards or check, as Jackson Diner is strictly cash only
I heard about this place via friends, magazines, etc
and finally made the trek out to JH for the best Indian food in the city
Other reviews rave about the lunch buffet, but while it looks fantastic, it was surprisingly VERY average
Not great, not bad
Basically, the food was not memorable
I remember my buddy (who is Indian) and I eating our food in bewildered silence
Maybe it was just the buffet
An Indian couple next to us were eating dosas that seemed decent
Super disappointed
A really nice buffet spread
Indian lunch buffets are a dime a dozen but I found the quality of all the dishes here to be a cut above the usual
Chicken makhani, vegetable pakora and saag paneer were all delicious
They also had a much wider variety of things than many buffet places do
The restaurant itself is sort of odd-looking, and the clientele runs heavily to families with screaming brats (make sure you're seated at a free standing table and not one of the tables that shares a communal long bench), but the food makes it well worth the visit to Jackson Heights
Beat the rush by arriving around 11:45am-12pm
The strip of sari shops out there makes for a fun afternoon of window shopping, too!
After reading reviews here, I had to check this place out
I went there for dinner yesterday, and was very disappointed
I am Indian, and the food was nothing compared to the actual taste
In fact, I have had much better food in Jersey City and New York
I was very disappointed, since I had heard good things about this place from Indians! The malai kofta was not that tasty, chicken makhni was improperly cooked, samosa chaat and masala dosa were okay
The only thing I liked was bread and mango lassi
I loved the lassi! The bread was very good, fresh, and soft
In fact, we even got a bread on the house! But I was still disappointed
well what can i say i have eaten indian food all over the world and i have never ever had indian food this good!!!!My husband and i are not much of a buffet lover, but that all changes the second you walk into this place, their variety,consistency, and quality are mind blowing
their buffet has the best variety, something for everyone, i love the kadhi, the chaat, and the chole those are my favorites
my husband loves the chicken makhani and chole
and we savor their kheer and gulab jamun
they have a perfect mix of spice and flavor
and once you are there you will be suprised how many plates of food you can actually consume-excluding dessert of course
so if you want some authentic delicious tasting indian food check this place out no matter how far the commute may be
its well worth it
OUT OF INDIA EXCELLENT CHOICE VERY TEASTY INDIAN FLAVOURED FOOD EXCELLENT MALAICOFTA
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY LOVES TO GO THERE
For the price ($8), the quality of the buffet is great! They have samosas, chicken tikka masala, and a lot of other dishes you can think of
I recommend coming here if you have some time for lunch!
Some Advice: Staff is very rude if you enter the restaurant between 9:55 PM - 10:05 PM
So if thats the time you are hitting Jackson Dinner ~ Think again make another choice
Food is OK! Pretty hyped but nothing spectacular
Limited choices on the menu
Try the sampler platter and some variations if you are going in a large group
Whatever you do DO NOT ASK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS
Service is effecient but misses the personal touch, it's all about the order and once you have placed an order, Boy it can take you ages to catch staff's attention for something else (They are all glued to the big Screen Indian TV on the ceiling)
Make sure you are wearing Not the best of your wardrobe or the food smell will embrace your clothes and all you know you will end up giving your clothes for Dry Cleaning
order dishes to share for the table and you will end up spending less that you expected and leave fuller than you can imagine
Pretty tasty
even my pal who just arrived from India thinks so
Jackson Dinerm compared to its surrounding restaruants, is a fairly modern looking Indian restaurnant in the heart of Little India/Pakistan
The lunch buffet is a great deal but you get better deals in many of the surrounding restaurants
I highly recommend this place for people who want to go to Jackson Heights for its very South Asian bazaar like feel (the sights, the smells, the people - its all there!) but who are a little afraid to go into the other establishments where the locals flock and which don't look as 'nice'
My favorite dish at their buffet is the karhi (or kardhi) which is basically made from yogurt graham flour and is eaten with white rice
However, if you'd like to be a little adventerous, Kebab King Palace around the corner is a great deal for really authentic South Asian (specifically Pakistani) food
Jackson Diner was my first intro to true Indian food and its been 10yrs since and I cannot go one month without some of this unbelievable food
My faves are the mixed grill, lamb korma and the chiken tikka makhanwalla is divine
The friendly and courteous staff is a wonderful compliment to the food
When I don't feel like trecking to the city and I'm in the mood for some great Latin food--I always hit up Casa Colombia
The food is so good
reasonably priced
and the service is prompt
It has a laid back feel--walk in--sit wherever you want
and enjoy the food
They have music playing while Telemundo plays on the TV sets (During the summer-they had the olympics)  Some of the wait staff don't really speak much English--but it has never been a problem --just point to whatever you want if that happens :) Never messed up an order
The platano maduro is the best I've had
so are the tostones
Give it a try-you won't be dissappointed :)
I loved this place
It has 30 tables spaciously located, great food, desserts and drinks
Professional and friendly staff
They accommodate group luncheons, dinners and parties and it is romantic and is also a great to bring children
I highly recommend it
This quaint Italian restaurant offers everything, great food, ambiance, an extremely polite staff which offers excellent service
There seafood salad is to die for, the Paella on Wednesdays is the best I've ever had and the desserts are super scrumptious
The restaurant is tranquil and intimate and it's minutes away from Manhattan

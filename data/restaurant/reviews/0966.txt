Its like nothing else, so give it a try
The Scene This worldly little bistro, filled with palm fronds, primitive masks and sand-colored leather banquettes, is an oasis of cool in an otherwise culture-deprived block, where the LES meets Chinatown
Creative cocktails alone are worth the trek: Patrons sip them around the circular bar, and spill them when squeezed into wood tables
But even at its busiest, casual service is swift and friendly
The Food The mid-priced French colonial cuisine arrives via the Cote d'Ivoire
Goat cheese toasts with fruity frisee, and rich lobster bisque are crowd-pleasers, while grilled calamari--tender and tousled with fragrant herbs, ginger and chilies--appeals to more adventurous appetites
Roasted sea bass, wrapped in a paper-thin potato crust, is fresh and moist, as is tomato-lime braised chicken with savory peanut sauce
Korhogotefemougar, though impossible to pronounce, deserves house-specialty status: Grilled, sprinkled with chili powder and served with cassava crisps, it's a juicy African-inspired steak frites
unfortunately, a very disappointing experience
as in seinfeld, they know how to take a reservation, but do not know how to hold a reservation
not only they don't honor your reservation they tell you that they don't care if you leave because they are so busy anyway
there are many restaurants in the city, no need to go to a place that doesn't value its patrons
oh, by the way, the food is mediocre at best
overall, not for people with discriminating tastes
however, for people looking for the anti-french attitude, fits the bill:)
It has such a great menu, small but eclectic
The mussels were absolutely fabulous
My friend had the chicken which was fab and I had the lamb which was delicious
The cocktails are great
It's just a wonderful little place where you won't break the bank
And the African flair makes it great
A truly unique place
It's a cozy almost cramped space, where, once settled in, you're treated to a delicious selection of french/african dishes and well-picked wine or cocktails
The djs play a fine selection of international dance music and the waiters are friendly and never pushy
A lovely spot for a late night drink too, especially when they open the large windows facing the street
ok, so everyone says that the wait is atrocious, the place is tiny etc etc
but i think that is precisely its small quaintness that makes it charming
the music is FANTASTIC
perfect dinner music
even if you have to wait for a spot at the bar to wait for your table, the music and design of the space create an ambiance that is simultaneously chic and comfortable - something extraordinarily difficult to find in this city
i agree that the lack of waiting space is irritating and should be changed, but it is a tiny price to pay for such a wonderful experience
p
s
the wine list is fab (although extraordinarily short) - all affordable and surprisingly delicious
There are so many wonderful restaurants in NY that no one should bother with this place! We made a reservation and waited 30 minutes to be seated and the staff was really rude to us! After being seated, we waited for almost an hour to have something to eat and were really disappointed by the quality of the food! Finally, if you don't want to waste a nice evening, definitely don't go there and don't foraget that in NY you have a huge choice of nice places
!
I went in on Sunday night alone and a recent transplant to the neighborhood
the waitress was great and the food was wonderful! It is going to be my Sunday dinner spot for sure
Thank you so much for making me feel welcome in the hood
Although we had a 9:30 reservation, when my boyfriend and I arrived promptly on time, we were told there was just a bit of a wait
After an hour of waiting at an overcrowded bar with our coats in our hands and no room to move, I approached the host (who never bothered to give us an update throughout our wait) to ask him how much longer, He was incredibly rude and dismissed me with his hand and walked away from me while I was trying to talk to him! After paying a fortune for our drinks, we left without eating
No matter how good the food is, it can't be worth waiting in a tiny closet of a restaurant on the lower East Side and being treated like trash by the host
What a welcome surprise to find this very different restaurant in the heart of Chinatown
My guest had the impossible to pronounce steak - we both thought it passed as a good steak
I had fish
Dish was small but delicious
The casssava fries were just incredible
We ordered them twice
Not the place to go if you are looking for a great alcohol mixed drink but they did have their own house special drinks if you've tried them all and are in search of something new
Service was excellent and the atmosphere quite comfortable
we ordered four drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert -- all of which were interesting and delicious
best of all, it was a great value
we highly recommend
There is a reason why the wait is what it is
the food is delicious and the atmosphere is adorable
I love the fact that its small and cozy
The music helps too
Where else can you go and listen to Fela Kuti one minute and The Star Wars Cantina song the next? That steak is so spectacular
You, know, the one with the name that no one can pronounce
When you ask for medium rare, it always comes out medium rare
not rare, not medium, but medium rare
And those fries
Good times kids
What's the point fo making reservations for this place? We arrived on time and were made to wait next to an overburdened bar area full of drunken frat boys that should have been cut off hours before
After an hour waiting and what seemed like a what do we care attitude from the staff, we left and went to eat elsewhere
Lousy service!
We waited almost an hour to be seated for our 8:30 reservation even though we were told it would be only 20 minutes when we walked in
Given that there is basically no room whatsoever to sit or stand near the bar, it was one of the most uncomfortable hours of my life
Once we did get seated, we asked for bread and water 3 or 4 times before someone finally brought them over
While the food was actually good, it was not worth the uncomfortable wait and substandard service
My four friends and I waited almost two hours after our 8:00 pm reservation and finally walked out without eating
The rude and unaccomodating hostess (who we later learned was the manager) repeatedly promised us the next table but never offered to buy us a drink while we waited
The drinks we eventually purchased ourselves (the barstaff was incredibly inattentive) were puny and overpriced
To top it off, when we finally left, they would not give us our coats unless we paid a coat-check fee
And many other parties left that night without getting seated despite having reservations
It was a terrible experience
I have been to many new and eclectic places in NY and I have to admit this is in line with places like Esperanto, BAO, Casimire and Paladar (etc
) If you like an energetic atmosphere in addition to a possitive crowd and funky-gormet (meaning traditional meats/bases with innovative spices) then this is the place
The fact that it out of the way only adds to it's personality and mystique
Believe me - if you're a new yorker, you will enjoy the tight, crowded, friendly and crazy space
Something to remember
I made a reservation at Les Enfants Terribles but had to wait for 20 minutes after the reservation time, only to be crammed into a tiny table between two other tiny tables
My date, next to the wall, fared well, but I was continually elbowed by the patrons at the bar, which was only a few feet away
Our waitress' visits to our table were few and far between
The food was excellent, but it wasn't worth the lack of intimacy and uncomfortably close quarters
I'm amazed at how positive these reviews are
We had made reservations for a friend's birthday dinner, but as they seated us, the hostess told us we could only have our table for 40 minutes
What? we asked
She couldn't be serious
Well, throughout our mediocre meal, the same hostess came back to glare at us and make us feel uncomfortable about conversing
When she came to ask if we wanted anything else and we told her just the check (by that point, we'd decided to get dessert elsewhere), she grabbed the plates off the table and left BEFORE WE WERE EVEN FINISHED! The ambience is cool, and the cocktails might be worth coming by, but head somewhere else for dinner
It's just not worth the 'tude
We had 10 pm reservations last weekend and arrived early in hopes of getting seated sooner
While we (a party of 4 girls) were promised the next table available, a group of men came in who were given the next available seats
We had spoken to them casually at the bar as they waited, and they suggested they had slipped the maitre'd some money
So they got seated ahead of us, and as a result, we didn't get seated until ten of midnight, which was ten minutes before the kitchen closed
The maitre'd did give us some free appetizers and champagne, but we were pretty frustrated
The food, however, was very good
Despite of the warm and pleasing ambiance of the place, you will be disappointed by a pushy service and a not as good as it looks food
On busy nights, you really feel they're trying to make you eat and pay as fast as they can

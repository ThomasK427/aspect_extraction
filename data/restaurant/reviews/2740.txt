The service was good enough for a crowded place
A few bites of a tasty steak is all this place offers
The ridiculous price for steak that is very good, but miniscule in size (a steak for 3 is big enough for 2), combined with the horrible service made me appreciate a real steakhouse like Sparks much more
I've been fortunate to have eaten at some of the (arguably) finest steak houses throughout the United States
This also includes more than my share of places in N
Y
C
, and I must say that Peter Luger's Steak House is way over rated
In my opinion Mark Joseph's steak house, off of Peck Slip in lower Manhattan is the (#1) one
The owner Charlie is a former employee of Peter Luger's who ventured out on his own and surpassed his former master
The steaks are just as good, with an assortment of tasty side dishes that make Peter Luger's menu look like the slip in a fortune cookie
Moreover, the staff and ambiance are both warm and inviting
Loved eating here while I was in the Big Apple
Apples and Steak
nothing better!
There is no other steak to compare
The meat is fork-cutting tender, buttery in texture, and has a rich beefy flavor that puts all others who claim to dry-age to shame
The cooking can be a little uneven and is done-ness usually a half-step below what youd expect, so order accordingly
The steak for one has no filet, so skip it and plan to share a steak for two or have copious leftovers
Pass on the tomatoes and onions
Dont pass on the bacon, as its on par with the steak
The potatoes are proof that God loves us, grease-fried and perfectly crisp
I've never been during the dinner rush, whence I think most of the service complaints originate
Do yourself a favor and go at lunchtime, or even better, early Sunday
Getting to the Williamsburg location can be tedious and paying in cash a pain, but well worth it
A typical old New York steak-house atmosphere - no ambience, comfort or class, but some of the best steak you will ever have
Worth the experience at least once! The creamed spinach is also great as is their special steak sauce
Try the tomatoes and onions for a complete treat
Baffling how some places consistently get high reviews
The porterhouse steak was very good, excellent crust and flavor, but no way is this the best steak house in NY
Michael Jordans is clearly better, for one
I have also had far superior steaks at other restaurants
Given the horrible location, no decor and poor side dishes, I don't see why anyone would choose Peter Lugers for a steak dinner
The beacon of new york and everything steak stands for
A must on your list when visiting
If you are a native and never been then shame on you
Toss out your bottle of lugar steak sauce in the frig untill you have experienced the meaning of eating a steak
Peter Luger's defines what a steak should be
It's the best on the planet
Bobby Van's is a close second
I'll go to Luger's just for the steak and the bacon strips
Worth the wait to get in but don't wait outside
After my second and last visit, I was surprised at how such mediocre food (and service) could get such hype -- which is what Luger's is all about
My porterhouse was tough, partner's ny strip overcooked (wanted it medium-rare) and the service was surly
And these rip off artists want cash only -- ha!
I laugh at all these ill comments toward Peter Lugers Restaraunt
These people must either 1 of 3 things,1-Don't know quality of food when they have it 2-Just like to complain 3-Are being put up to this by a competitor to bad mouth the man PETE
Cmonn people,just take a ride to LUGERS and see for yourself the quality of this place
and be sure to read all awards won by LUGER since 1988 till present for Best Steak
By far the best steak in the New York area and I've tried Sparks, Morton's, Smith Wollensky, etc
and they don't come close
Unlike others, they actually make the steak exactly to your specification
What a unique concept
After reading other reviews I was expecting poor service and ambience but was pleasantly surprised by our more than helpful waiter
My only complaints are the less spectacular sides and menu items other than steak
In addition, it is amazing how they still expect you to pay cash or open a house credit card given that dinner for a party of 8 will easily run close to or above $1000 with wine
No disrespect intended, but that area in brooklyn is not necessarily the best to be carrying thousands in cash
the best steak you will EVER eat!! Make a reservation way in advance!! Bring cash, no credit cards here! come hungry is the best advice!!
What is not to like about Peter Luger's? Having the shrimp for an appetizer
Then the steak dinner for two, which I recommend never getting anything over medium well, with potatoes and spinach
For dessert the pecan pie, comes warm with whip cream
Its the best!
The very best of the best, Porterhouse for two is worth it's weight in gold! Love the waiters, Luger potatos, and cream spinach
The only place that has fresh and tasty tomatos in the winter!
While Peter Luger doesn't have the most inviting decor or atmosphere, what do you expect from a Steakhouse from the late 1800's?!  Nothing comes close to what Luger's does, and oh, how they do it so well
Don't bother looking at a menu- Shrimp cocktail, steak for 1,2,3, or more, creamed spinach and hash browns, and save room for the pecan pie and cheese cake, and don't forget the SCHLAG!!!!!
All I can say is MMMMMM! From steak to schlag (whipped cream) this is the best steak house in the universe
The huge porter house for two was one of the best steaks I ever had
Highly recommend it
If you are in Bronx, Queens, Staten Island or Manhattan it's worth the trip
This is the best in the world
Down right comfortable, pleasant, enormous portions, have lunch and bring home a doggie bag wth your dinner
It's friendly, it is a wonderful place
You'll never want to eat steak anywhere else unless you have the Peter Luger's Sauce in your bag
large portions full of flavor
must come with an appetite
try their garlic mashed potatoes!
If you like your steak well-done, don't waste your time or money coming here
They don't know how to cook a steak well-done, they just sear it to a black charcoal crisp on the outside and its still not fully cooked inside
I went there last week with four friends
We ordered the steak for four and some side dishes (the cream spinach was a bit salty, but the German fries was really good)
For appetizers try the shrimp cocktail, it was really good
I was prepared for bad service from all the previous reviews I read, but our waiter was really nice
The steak was unbelievable, I will definitely come back again
BEST STEAK IN NEW YORK
THIS IS A REAL STEAKHOUSE WITH PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE MEAT BUSINESS NOT A STEAKHOUSE RUN BY PEOPLE WHO SIT AT DESKS
THEY HAND PICK THEIR MEAT,DRY-AGE FOR 28 DAYS WHAT COULD BE BETTER
THE OTHER SO CALLED STEAKHOUSES GET THEIR MEAT SIGHT UNSEEN WET AGED IN A BAG, AND CUT FOR THEM
Unfortunately, I spent my birthday at Peter Luger's
We'd never been and I expected the steak of my dreams
I at least thought we would see a menu, but instead were asked how we wanted the steak (by the way we were never told that the steak was per table and not person and we also weren't told what kind of steak)
We ordered it medium which in their opinion means dripping blood (practically seared) and a side of hash browns and spinach
The steak prepared that way made my companion ill
The hash browns were burned and the spinich had no flavor
The steak was okay at best
Next time I'm going to Smith Wollensky's for a REAL steak!!!
The best
HAnds Down! The steak, which is a Porterhouse cut, is buttery soft and delicious
The tomato and onion salad appetizer is great
Creamed Spinach is great

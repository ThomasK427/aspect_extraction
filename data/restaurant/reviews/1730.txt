The wasabi dipping sauce (along with the other two) are very tasty
Calimari never tasted better
The entrees are always interesting and I haven't had a bad one yet
Same with the desserts
I don't know how many dates I've taken to Punch - lol
the food here is fantastic
clever thai fusion dominates one of the best menus in the city for the price! highly recommended!
I entertain many of my buisness associates at Punch usually in the evenings
The barstaff is always warm welcoming, the host is dynamite he always knows who I am gets us in rite away  usually in the most comfortable area the menu is eclectic inexpensive, service is always right, I will continue to support this fun restaurant
I totally love this place
I go as often as I can with friends or dining alone
The service is quick
The host is engaging and the service is good
I've tried several things on the menu and I'm stuck on their version of Pad Thai with chicken
The prices are good
Very affordable for Manhattan
The ambience is wonderful especially in the summer when they open up the facade
I've never gone with a big group so I can't comment
Great place to take a date or bring your date
The bar is good
Good cosmos
Clean restrooms
Really great menu
Have been here for dinner a few times and each time the food has been delicious
the flavors are so interesting
love all of the appetizers, especially the tomato and white bean soup, it is almost like a stew
all of the lite bites are great - especially ifyou are not too hungry
Service and decor are really nice too
I took my mother here a few weeks ago and we had a great dinner
The food was fresh and delicious, and the wait staff was very friendly
having a small party (2-4) for brunch at punch is recommended
pros: seating is quick, service (for the most part) is efficient, fabulous baked muffins given pre-entree, pricing is reasonable considering the large portions, and it has a nice aura
cons: not good for large groups and the dinners aren't as good as the brunches
oh and during the summers - when they open up the restaurant - flies sometimes enter
Aside from being completely empty on a Wednesday, the food was bland, and the wine selection spotty
More manchu-wok than pan-asian
Service was good, however
My friends and I went here for a fun, after work get together and we must say we were dually impressed
The atmosphere was trendy but laid back, the food was really delicious and the prices were just right! We had 3 very different meals, 3 very different drinks and liked everything
The bar area is kinda small, so plan on getting there early if that's all you want to do
Make reservations if going anytime past 7
While the food and overall atmosphere may be excellent at this upscale yet affordable restaurant, the management is arrogant and inhospitable, unless your in
If your not hip with the management goodluck enjoying yourself
Great waitstaff, and bar service, but wheres the management going?
My good friends and I ate at Punch last night, and we were left astounded by everything from the menu selections to the prompt and attentive service to the extremely reasonable bill
The menu had such exotic combinations of food, demonstrating the chef's knowledge of how spices complement each other
I had cane and sake glazed salmon over field greens, cilantro, and a slab of watermelon ($13) - delicious and very filling! Another reason why I give such a high rating to Punch is because of its ambience - very trendy with dim lighting and plush seats - modern is good in my book
I will definitely take out guests to Punch again!
amazing blending of flavors from around the middle east and asia -- incredibly delicious, affordable and huge portions! The wine list is diverse and intriguing
Excellent service, beautiful and friendly
I would recommend Punch to all my friends!
I was vistiting NYC, staying in the Gramercy Park area and I'm so glad I found this little Italian place! The atmosphere is casual but the food is great
If you're in the mood for pasta, you have to stop here
Everything was fresh, especially the veggies and homemade salad dressing
Very reasonable prices too
I finally checked out this neighborhood pasta place, and was delighted
Traditional Italian pasta (not Italian-American), simple but extremely well cooked
We had involtini, primavera and rolotini
Each was excellent: al dente, flavorful, and just the right amount
Service and decor were fine, but it's the food that I'll be coming back for
I haven't found better pasta in NYC yet
the woman manager has added new life to the dining
food remains highly recommended as thoughtfully prepared, generous, and flavorful
however the ambience has seemed less edgy during the past week
gracious hospitality and warmth were exuded by the staff--with personal attention provided by owner in assuring satisfaction with our meal
Lamarca has it all for the visitor to New York--good pasta, reasonable price, clean and friendly setting, and great service
I went out with my girlfriend the other day and we stumbled across this tiny restaurant in the heart of Gramercy Park
The decor was not very catchy but the food was amaizing
For $20 per person we got a salad, warm bread, we got to choose any kind of pasta with any kind of sauce and we had a good glass of wine each
And all this for $20 bucks a person
it's amaizing that one can still find deals like this in such expensive neighborhoods
So I definitely reccomend this place to anybody
good food, exquisite staff and super cheap price!!!
If you are in the neighborhood, I definitely recommend stopping in to try a signature tossed salad -- it is amazing
Their salad dressings and soups are also quite tasty
Lunch time can get a little crazy, so if you're looking for a place to sit for a while, I would recommend between 2pm and 4pm
I go to Tossed frequently (2-3 times per week) and they screw up my order frequently
I'm a big-time salad lover, but I can't stand to pay $9 for a salad that has dressing on it when I order it on the side or they put ingredients that I don't like on my salad
I don't recommend it based on the poor service
In Short Of all the diners and coffee shops in New York, Eisenberg's--which dates back to 1929--is among the most classic
Paper-capped cooks and fast-talking waitresses serve reliable favorites like pastrami, corned beef and tuna salad on rye
Check the limited evening hours before planning your meal
My first visit to Eisenberg's won't be the last
I joined a couple of friends on a Monday morning before the start of a crazy work week and enjoyed pipin' hot coffee and an awesome toasted bacon-egg-cheese bagel
It's a complete throwback to a bygone era that my generation has gentrified (not that there's anything wrong with that)
It's a place to enjoy the service, the food, and what it stands for
hard work and a full stomach
Looking forward to being back!
As a native New Yorker who now lives in Los Angeles (oy vey), every time I come home this place is a must-stop
They seem to have new management, because the quality of the food has greatly improved since my last visit
They now home-made chopped liver which is, seriously, the best I have ever had
The matzoh ball soup is still great, AND, they now have delicious flame-broiled burgers
It's always nice to have a satisfying lunch at a place that has been loved by New Yorkers long before I was born
I went on recommedations that they have great sandwiches and even ordered the tuna melt, which Eisenburg raves to be the best
The sandwish was tasteless, below average
For the taste I could have gone to a regular deli and gotten it for 1/3 of the price they charged
I was disappointed and won't return
Pull up a seat and have a Ruben, Pastrami, or Tuna
The best sandwich shop and can be beat
The melts can't be beat and the countermen are unbelievable

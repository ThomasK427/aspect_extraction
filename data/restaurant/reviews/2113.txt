Get it with cheese and bacon for the true experience
It did not have a char broiled flavor like a BBQ but it wasnt made on a griddle, it was broiled so it was meaty and delicious and adorned with a small bun, sliced white onion, lettuce, and tomato
The fries were also crispy and very tasty
I compare them to McDonlads except with less grease and more potato
This place is the spot, you've gotta try it
I got all this deliciousness (fries, burger, beer) for 10 bucks
OK so it's no big secret
Bartender told me they but their meat up the street on 11th (the ole' meat district) every day
They use a Salimander to above broil and slow cook
The bun is small to bring out the burger
Simple but unreal! Try it - try it - try it! The tap beers are a bit pricey though
NO PINTS! Just small mugs
Burgers served on a paper plate with small pickle slices
Just the way I like em'
The bartender (who works the late night shift) is rude, inconsiderate, and inhospitable
He clearly has social and anger management problems, and is not fit to work in the hospitality industry
My friends and I would have had a lovely time if we weren't treated so horribly
The burger was as good as advertised, although I have to say the fries were a little puny
Excellent prices for the beers though, and overall a great cheap eats experience
If you can get past the crowd and actually get a table, you'll get a great burger
The food and beer are cheap and fast, even late night
Everything is served on paper plates and there's nothing fancy about it, but thats part of the beauty of it
Corner Bistro has been around for a long time, and is well known for having a great burger
They live up to their reviews
A true institution
you're not here for the ABSOLUTE best burger in the city, it is among the best, you're not here for the clean glasses, the beer is great though, you're not here for a quick bite, beer makes the hour long wait go faster
At least it keeps the tourists away
This place is not what it used to be
not even close
For years I would tell anyone and everyone I knew that if they wanted the best bacon cheeseburger ever, to go here
Now, it's simply a hollow shell of what it used to be
The burgers are dry and overcooked
The wimply plate of cold, overcooked fries is a joke
And, the service is just abysmal
I've been a few times over the last 2 years and it's just been disappointing
I never minded waiting in line because I knew what I was getting in return
not anymore
There are better burgers to be had
MUCH better
don't bother with this place
These were by far the best french fries that I have ever had
Man, they were awesome
People
what you're all missing here is the bacon
it's like a work of art
Take a peek at the deep fry thing next time you're there (under the burger grille)
They cook cook the bacon in the same grease the fries are in!  This makes the bacon unbelivably delicious and crunchy, the fries have a delicious meaty bacon grease taste, and the whole place smells like bacon
Genius!  Also, the burgers are pretty darn good
so that the jostling, spilled beers, and hour long wait doesn't bother you
The waiters were brusque but really efficient - they got all our orders right and even heard my quiet request for water
They serve all burgers well done regardless of what you ask for
It's cheap but I probably won't go back unless it's empty (I guess, like past reviews said, before 6 pm), which will probably never happen
At 3 am this place is money to grab one more beer and a burger
The menu's are on the wall and it's just bench style tables
The place is crowded late nite from all the heads rollin drunk so you may have to wait for a table
but go to the back, you have a better shot of getting one
Can't beat the prices either
Although it looks like a whole in the wall, its a cool spot for a late night burger, espcially if your in the mood to relax, but you better order two burgers if you plan on getting full
Its old fashion and thats the beauty of it
I finally ventured to Corner Bistro yesterday to see whether their burgers deserve the accolades lavished on them
Well, they don't
The cheeseburger I had was fine-- good, even-- but the patty was a little dry and the bun was thin and soggy
The fries were good, but identical to McDonald's version for twice the price; I don't think I would be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test
The antique feel of the pub is nifty; I didn't have to wait for one for of the ten tables at 5:45, but there was a line out the door by 6:15
Service was lacking; my coke was served in a recently washed mug and tasted vaguely of rum, and I had to flag down my waiter twice for ketchup and napkins
Corner Bistro has personality and decent food; you'll enjoy it if you don't go expecting fireworks
I don't understand where some of these people get off calling the Corner Bistro not good
Look, even Peter Luger's has an off night and the steaks don't come out right
But that's part of what makes the place special
You'll wait a long time by a dark crowded bar, you might have something spilled on you but when you leave you'll understand why you did it
You also can't beat $2 beers
I'm by most accounts a CB lightweight, having only been there about 30 times
I'd say I've had a bad burger there once or twice
And it was still better than anything Jackson Hole turns out, which was an oversized soggy piece of meat and bread
The burgers here are good, but I don't know how this is always rated the best
Its just a plain burger-nothing special
The french fries were really good, though
The price is definately right for both the food and the drinks
The burger is pretty tastless and doesn't have much cheese on it
The bun is a little too small, but very good
The problem is that the bun gets all soaked with the burger juice and everything starts to fall apart
If you want a better burger go to Boxers on W4 between 6th and 7th
The burgers there are way better and its not overcrowded and overrated there
The atmosphere is a lot nicer, too
It'll cost you a little more though, but you get what you pay for
Too many people are on to this place for a great burger
The wait sometime can be long since the place is so small
The burgers are consistently excellent fare
I've been twice and both times were great
The burgers are so soft and the fries are perfectly crisp! The ambiance is typical of a pub and there's a long line
But, if you go with some friends and order a beer while you wait, it's well worth it
This is by far the worst hamburger I have ever had
I have no idea who said it was the best and why, but this person surely was raised in some sort of desparate conditions where red meat was not readily available
The burgers were dry and overcooked regardless of how they were ordered
The fries sucked and the atmosphere is a cross between MASH's Mess Tent and Animal House!  Don't buy into the hype and wait 45 minutes being pushed and shoved around by drunk frat boy wanna be's in order to get possibly one of the worst meals you will ever eat
The Corner Bistro HAD the best burgers in the city
My boyfriend and I went back recently and found the burgers to be bland and the texture was like sawdust
And the chili for the chili burger was flavorless
tasted like ground beef with tomato sauce
not chili! I don't know what they did to the burgers but they are definitely not as good as they were 2 years ago

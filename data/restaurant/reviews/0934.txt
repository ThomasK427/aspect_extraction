Although, I was a bit disappointed with the service on a few occasions (our order was mixed up with another table who had ordered the same meal, but arrived twenty minutes after we did!!!) And sometimes you do feel as though you are being rushed with the wait staff hovering over you to take your plate, but I guess that's how it is when seating is very limited in such a small restaurant
However, the food was absolutely delicious! You must try the Frita cubana con yuca fritas which is 4 mini hamburgers with garlic sauce and ketchup for the fries
They also make an excellent cuban sandwhich
One of the best!
Cafecito is a relatively undiscovered Cuban restaurant that offers great food in a warm and friendly setting
Although a bit out of the way on Avenue C it is well worth the trip
The fried plantains are a ridiculous bargain and dangerously good
The food has never disappointed and the portion sizes are enormous so it is reasonable to split
Cafecito is a great place to get together with a few friends for a low key night
The noise level can get high (likely attributed to their potent sangria) so I wouldnt go on a Friday or Saturday night if you want something quiet
It is worth noting that one or many can consume ridiculous amounts of alcohol while spending relatively little
No one I know has ever left hungry or sober for that matter
Overall this is one of the best secrets out there and a great value
Know before you go: Cafecito only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more
We went on a Tuesday after work, it was not crowded at all
Very friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff
We ordered three of the appetizers which were incredible - Black Bean and Corn fritters, Shrimp fritters, and sea bass ceviche along with an extra order of tostones and maduros
The sangria was not bad overall - very large pitcher
We all ordered the churassco flank steak with the chimmichurri sauce and pickled onions
Wow! I have never tasted anything so good
Great mojitos and cafe con leche mixed drinks
We ordered the flourless chocolate cake which was just so-so
Overall, excellent value, excellent food
Nice atmosphere
The place was completely filled by the time we left
Would definitely come back again
cafecito only accepts reservation for 6 or more
Even w/ a reservation (8 PM, Friday night) my friends and I waited for about 30 minutes
Food is good, portions are decent but getting our food took a little while
Our waitress was friendly and our water glasses were never empty
Price as very reasonable, a meal for 5 plus drinks was under $200 including gratuity
Con: Be ready to sit very closely to your neighbors, as the dining area is very narrow and small
It was good and the food had a lot of flavor like real cuban food is
The restaurant is small but if you go after 1pm for lunch then you find space for a relaxing lunch
I freakin' love this place and I swear it's not the sangria talking
When you walk through the door of this quaint little place not only are the owners and staff super friendly but so are the people who go there
The food- que rico! Try the Cuban sandwich with extra garlic sauce or Camarones Al Ajillo or for bruch The Three-eyed Manny is phenomenal
I have had virtually every item on the menu including weekend brunch and I love it all-really it's that good!!! The down side, I am usually so stuffed that I don't want to leave
So, the long trek home is on foot just to help digest
See you there!!!
Our first visit to this little jewel of a find in the East Village was so nice
The Cuban Cafe, under the blue awning true ethnic food only better, all ingredients are fresh and the grilling just right
The Bollos appetizer, this deliciouss black bean, roasted corn fritter w/a tsty dipping sauce and the Mahi Mahi was grilled just right
The waitstaff seemed to handle the service well
Good beats, nice people, price is right nice to see all the honeys and you can sit outside at the lunch counter, have a mojito or two, eat good food and feel like you are somewher in Key West 50 yrs ago
This place has to be experienced its that cool
The wait for a table can be long, but its worth it
If you and your friends or even just a friend are looking for authentic food and perfect ambiance to enjoy sangria and croquettas, Cafecito is perfect
On a nice beautiful day sit outside and eat like your drinking pints and enjoy celebrations on any day to make for a great intimate party
Enjoy Cafecito!
Starving on a cold Saturday night some friends and I stumbled across a little Cuban restaurant in the East Village called Cafecito
It was packed with a hour wait time
Although we opted to leave, the vibrent atmosphere and the friendly staff intrigued us
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria
When we got our table, I was a bit tight but what space they lack Cafecito makes up for with their food
Every entree was delicious, I recommend the Vaca Frita or the Chilean Sea Bass, you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm torn
The food is DELICIOUS and so cheap! You will be stuffed for under $10  The only bad thing--is the service
While the servers are usually friendly and accomadating
many times--the service is lousy
Seems like they get a new wait staff everytime we go and they don't know what they are doing
Once we sat at a table and had water dripping on our heads for our entire meal
But they made it up to us by giving us free drinks and wiping the AC  Nice inside--but many times -we opted to just order the food to go and eat in the car
Since it's a small place--they are stingy with the seating arrangements
If it's packed--be prepared to share some salt and pepper with the people sitting oh about 2cm from you
But despite all the negative--the food is so damn tasty
one of the best places for cuban/latin food
Inexpensive, real Miami Cuban food in generous portions
In my 10 years of living in NYC since moving from Miami, I have yet to come across a place with authentic cuban classics that taste as good as places like Versailles, La Carreta, Puerto Sagua,etc
, until this nice find
The prices are right and the menu covers all the main appetizers,soups,main dishes, deserts beverages you would find at Miami's favorite places, plus taste very good
Matre d' refused to give my wife and her friend a table for four, even though they insisted that their husbands were parking the car
Soup served luke warm
Main course order was mixed up with another table causing confusion and delay
Drinks were delayed and additional drinks that we did not order were brought
Rice was dry and tasteless
Check was presented as a total, not itemized
We sent it back and when itemized check arrived it was a lesser amount--the first check was overcharging us! Food not worth the hassle
this is my new favorite restaurant in the east village
a friend took me here a month ago i've been back every week since
the pollo cafecito is so good huge! i was stuffed for under $10
i highly recommend this place to anyone
great place to take a date
;)

This spot is so incredibly sweet--and the food! It's one thing if a restaurant serves delicious fare, but when it serves such generous portions as well! I had a great time here
I went in the winter and the ambience was fabulous: cozy and warm
I can't wait to go back when the weather warms up--sit outside, have a perfect sangria
If you like good Cuban food and you like an intimate atmosphere and you like to have a dining experience that leaves you feeling good about life
yes, you should visit Cafecito
If you're looking for a friendly place with great food, generous portions, and affordable dining, look no further than Cafecito
Everything works at this charming down-to-earth favorite of neighborhood locals
It's no wonder the owners had to expand the space
You'd be hard-pressed to find such scrumptious Cuban cuisine for such modest prices anywhere else in the city
The inventive menu delights tastebuds with just the right amount of flavor and authenticity
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu (everyone in our party of five thought their entree was the best), but the assorted appetizers is a great way to get started
The place seems to be getting busier with each subsequent visit
Hurry up and enjoy before the best-kept secret on Avenue C gets out completely and the lines start overflowing
A group of us tried to get in the super trendy and super crowded Esperanto down the street (one hour wait)
I recommended we try Cafecito, never gone there before

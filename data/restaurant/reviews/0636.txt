But put your fear aside, the food is worth it!
The Scene Perched on the ninth floor of the luxe Barney's store, the light-filled dining room is the home-away-from-home for the city's shopping glitterati
Bedecked in Chanel and Prada, with designer sunglasses atop their heads, they rub elbows with suit-and-tie donning gentlemen and the occasional after-school group of teen girls
Service is fairly formal and reliably good
The Food Offering pizzas, entree-sized salads, various sandwiches, and pasta, fish and meat entrees, the menu aims to please
Hefty burgers with excellent fries find a home on most tables, but salads, including the signature Madison salad with canned Italian tuna, and a grilled chicken Caesar, are equally popular
Thin-crust pizzas, topped with wild mushrooms, hot sausage or Italian sliced meats, are a good option, as are fresh pastas, including a buttery carrot-filled ravioli
Dieters should opt for the full-flavored chicken soup, which the menu promises will help diners "cure colds and stay thin
"
I love barneys
I love freds
Get the burgers, the chicken soup, the white truffle pizza [to die for], and the pesto penne
Great people watching
Only down side is the long wait at lunchtime
Get there early and beat it
Then shop afterwards and walk off the calories
Ha!
Talk about eye and tummy candy, this is the place
Not only can you have a fabulous meal, but you can see and be seen in this Mid Town gem
The room is beautiful, the people are beautiful (plastic, yes, but still lovely top look at) and the fare is delightful
My favoritve, the home made pastas and soups of the day
The grilled fishes they offer are fresh and deliscious
The Pommes Frites, so good, the best, dare I say, in NYC
I can't say enough about the eatery
then there's shopping at Barneys!
This is maybe Manhattan people watching at its best
Everyone here is dressed to kill, the latest trends, the best brands
it's like a walking Bergdorf Goodman catalog (yes, I know it's Barney's, but the vibe is more Upper East Side chic than Barney's downtown edgy hip)
croc Birkins and Manolos abound
Oh yeah, the food
If you're coming for great food, go elsewhere
But the food at Fred's is good, solid fare, you won't be thrilled or disappointed, put it that way
Be forewarned that you will pay for it, tho
The service is ok, can be awful
Go for lunch -- everything falls apart at dinner!!
An interesting mix of hi-end shoppers, hi-finance types, foreigners, and onlookers make for a real people watching/gawking/speculating scene
The food is decent, the menu varied enough to satisfy everyone, and the service attentive
The room, on the 9th floor of Barney's, has an airy feel and has an appealing decor, but expect to pay a price for this high end real estate
Worth checking out once
Most of the people who eat here are thin, and once you order something, you'll see why
Though there are standouts--the thin chicken soup and the fries--most of the food is sub-par
Paying $32 for a lobster wrap with shreds of lettuce outnumbering pieces of lobster 20-1 is unacceptable
Upon first going to Fred's, I must admit my expectations were limited, given that I saw it as sort of a cool person/fashionista hangout, which usually means the food is mediocre
I was certainly way off on that prediction
Fred's food is nothing short of superb
Everything is delicious and of high quality, and the presentation is elegant
The service is very polished and alert
The decor is sleek and pleasing to the eye, as are many of the patrons
Price-wise, it's more than fair for what you are getting
Dinner for 4 the other night with a bottle of wine an desert came out to less than $200 (that includes a 20% tip), which isn't bad at all for a meal of this caliber
Highly recommended overall
This is my one of my favorite places to go during my lunch hour
Get the burger, and sit back and watch the floor show
I have dined at Fred's many times since I was first introduced a few years ago
Although I prefered the restaurant's cozy location in the basement, with its warm tones and soft furniture, the top floor location is almost equally desirable
The food is great, especially the chicken parmisagna and the dessert sampler
It's a great place to see celebs, Meg Ryan dines there often!
I go to Fred's quite often for lunch and time after time have tried to sit at the tables
but it never lives up to sitting at the bar for a meal
The bar is friendlier, faster, and more enjoyable all around
The tables are so close and perhaps due to lack of conversation at other tables, people always seem to be eaves dropping
my conversations aren't that interesting, so they must be bored stiff! The burger and fries is great, the pizza is excellent (especially the one with truffle oil), and if at all possible, order a bloody mary
if nothing else, it will make the people around you seem entertaining while they try to be stuffy to fit in!
I went to Fred's for brunch and had a pretty nice meal
This restaurant is a bit of a scene b/c after all, it is in Barney's
The service was pretty good and the food was good as well
The food is definitely overpriced for what it is, but that is what I expected
I have also been to Fred's for dinner and I had their fresh pasta which was a lot better than the brunch
The bread is delicious and the desserts were nice too
I will go back for convenience sake, but it didn't blow my socks off
The dessert is what brought me here in the first place -- a friend of mine had ordered a cake from them and recommended that I check it out
I was not at all disappointed
Their main draw is their pastries, but they serve Illy coffee -- which is the best, in my opinion -- have a large selection of muffins and these huge overstuffed cookies
I could spend hours gobbling up their sweets, all of which are fantastic
I've also had their wraps and quiches a few times, which we both very good
They also do catering and from what I hear, they do a great job with that too
Friendly service, nice hang out away from the noise and crowds of Washington Street
Parking can be a pain, depending on what day and time you go, but it's a breeze compared to dowtown or Washington Street
I have to say, out of all the cafes I've been to over the years, this is the one that keeps bringing me back time and again
Whether it's for a quick coffee in the AM, or an evening treat, they aim to please
The staff, especially Jessica Keith, are without a doubt as stellar as their desserts (too many to mention them all - a few favorites are Strawberry Shortcake, Cinnamon Pear tart, and Pumpkin Nougatine when in season)
But it doesn't stop there
they have wonderful wraps, salads, teas, and of course COFFEE! I've also had the pleasure of working w/them for a cocktail party they came through in a big way - hor d'ouerves, desserts, etc
everything was PERFECT they were so helpful accommodating
I honestly can't say a bad thing about them
except that maybe they should be open 24/7!! I love this place!
What a find! My friend and I had a delightful, first-time experience at this cafe
Friendly owners Keith and Jessica Carpentier made us feel right at home as they explained the different desserts they offer
We tried their mini signature cakes like the Chocolate Ganache and Hazelnut La Dome as well as their delectable cinnamon pear tart (my personal favorite)
And if that weren't enough, Ganache also serves an impressive selection of organically-grown, aromatic, loose-leaf teas such as Shanghai Rose (white tea with rose petals), Burrough's Brew (black tea with coconut), and Ruby Sipper (blood orange and pear tisane)
And you must try the Fiji tea--green tea with wild pineapple and papaya
The wonderful fragrance of the leaves alone will have you ordering a cup on the spot! A wide variety of high quality coffees, hot chocolates, cookies, muffins, scones, wraps and quiches are also available
Definitely worth a visit!
This cafe has any type of coffee you would like
It's the best!! I stop by a few times a week
I had Ganache do a wedding shower cake for me
It blew everyone away both by taste and design
Their dark chocolate mousse cake is best I have ever tasted
Also, they created cookies designed as wedding dresses for the favors
It was a great added touch for the shower!

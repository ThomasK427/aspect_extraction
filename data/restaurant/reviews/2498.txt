When I moved to the UWS to attend Columbia, I was excited to find a Korean restaurant in the area - my excitement was quickly erradicated when I ate at the Mill
The food was worse than almost any I had eaten
The Kal Bi (bbq short ribs) were tough and lukewarm, the Dok Buk Ki (spicy rice cakes) were overcooked and the remainder of the dishes we ate disappointed as well
Take the time to go to Korea Town (32nd St
area) and bypass the Mill
Mill is probably the worst Korean restaurant I've ever been to in NYC
It is only because it is the only Korean restaurant within the Columbia campus vicinity that people, who crave Korean food, choose to dine there
The food is served in very small portions, and the prices are not worth the amount of food they serve
Expect alot of bones, not alot of meat
Anyone who knows good quality Korean food will tell you Mill has very low quality food
Not to mention the service which is unattentive, forgetful, and reluctant to refill your sidedishes
As a student, I'm both thrifty and picky
The Mill satiated both ends
the food was affordable, and I could eat the Bi Bim Bop, Fried Mando, and sip Lime Rickey's all day
The lunch specials are great, the menu offers your basic authentic Korean fare
As a grad student, I used this place virtually as my extended kitchen - it's very small and cozy
I would recommend the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap (assorted veg
w
beef cooked w/ rice in a hot stone pot) and Soon Du Bu (a casserole of seasoned marinated boiled tofu)
My husband and I have not tried this place twice and decided on the second round not to go back again
The food is absolutely mediocre and standard bistro fare
The service is incredibly unprofessional
Our waiter kept asking US things like, Have you ordered yet? and seemed generally confused throughout the evening
Our waiter the first time around was similarly bad but we thought it might be a fluke
Apparently not
The maitre d' (who I assume is the owner) is very friendly, but that is about the only thing this place has going for it
It's not worth the price, especially in this neighborhood
There is so much better to choose from
This place never fails to please
It's small and serves good food quickly
That's really all we could ask for
The steak is one of my hubby's favorites around
I brought my girll here for a romantic Valentines day and this place crashed and burnt
The food was decent but the service was outright horrible
This place needs to get their act together
When the place ran out of rolls they were serving people english muffins, that is pathetic
English muffins in a french bistro, give me a break
For the amount of money that is charged I truly expected a lot more
The servers didn't know what tables the meals were going to, it was a complete comedy show
Maybe this place should hire about 5 more waiters
This was the first time I had warm ice cream and cold chocalate pie
This off-the-beaten-path upper west side gem is simply excellent
It is small and cozy and the food never fails to impress
Make sure you have a reservation, though, since this little oasis is popular with UWS locals
I live in the neighborhood and it's one of my favorite places
It's a cozy little place
The service is great
The menu might not be cutting edge or trendy but the food dependable and consistently good
Great atmosphere (but a little small), friendly and prompt service and reliable menu (altho limited)
Steak au poivre is served as a special sometimes and is great medium rare
Lemon charlotte is good and creme brulee is good although sometimes served cold
I always come back to this place
Not too fancy not too pretentious
Tables are on top of each other and the food was average and really not worth its price
Service was doing it's best
They must have better options in the neigborhood
Dined there many times and never disappointed
All items very good, beautifully presented, tasty
interesting dishes
Service very friendly and helpful
Awesome singers but the worst food I've ever had in any restaurant in the world - not kidding
Way overpriced and sterile
We went to the new Caffe Taci recently to take out friends and were sorely disappointed
From a solid homey, affordable Italian menu in a warm, exhileratingly crowded location they've gone to a 30$ minimum per person on opera nights with a quality of food and drink that just does not warrant the prices
Service was okay, the ambience mindbogglingly sterile and almost industrial due to the enormous ceiling to floor windows from which you have an uplifting view of cars and the other side of the street
If you can't hang curtains because of the acoustics, how about painting stage scenes on the glass?  The singers were good, the piano player continues to be amazing, but the overall impression was definitely one of never again
A real shame
I'll have to agree with the most recent reviews
Caffe Taci was a place where students and graduates from Manhattan School of Music used to go and break the ice with new repetoire
It was a fun and relaxed atmosphere
The food was good and solid and the atmosphere relaxed and comfortable
The new place has terrible food, terrible service and a pretty uninviting atmosphere
As for the music, I didn't stay to sing
This place is one of my sure bets for a Friday or Saturday night
World renowned opera singers perform their favorite pieces in a relaxed, sometimes even goofy atmosphere
Singers sometimes come for dinner with their musician friends, and you never know who'll suddenly get up on stage or turn a solo into a duet
No stuffiness, no cover, just plain fun and great music
And ever since they got a new chef the food is to die for
For the real fun, sit at the bar and chat with the singers, the owner, or the great bar woman
Before I ever moved to NY I came to visit and fell in love with it
Caf Taci was a place I could not stop telling people about
The ambiance, the performance, the feeling like you could not find a place like it anywhere else was intoxicating
I live in NY now and am SO disappointed that they moved
The innocence is gone
The magic extinguished and the food well- it suites the new locations decor
Went back to Caffe Taci because we loved the old place
Must agree with last reviewer that it has definitely lost something in the translation
Food was really bland, wine list limited, no bar and less ambience
I had eaten at Taci off and on for several years now
They prepared solid Italian standards, that, while nothing exceptional or superbly inventive, were well prepared and competently executed
The atmosphere was homey, easy, exposed brick, communal
Opera nights started off like natural, slightly odd twists to dinner
but there was no pressure, only fun
Taci then moved to NYU, to a space as warm as an igloo, with an equally cold atmosphere, an attempt at a more upscale menu, and with all the charm of a pizza joint
it has become a contrived effort to squeeze more money from a good idea that has been turned into shtick
The food suffered, and does not merit the higher prices in a crowded environment with overworked and undertrained staff
It's a shame Taci, nice to have known you
Taci has moved to a new location at NYU area
I have been at its UWS location many times, and loved it so much that I always brought my out-of-town visitors there
However, the new one was terrible! * Extremely slow service - we arrived by 9 pm, and did not get our first bite after 10:30 pm

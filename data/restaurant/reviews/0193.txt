We had the sushi chef make us a platte for the table and all the nigiri were so fresh, buttery and melted in our mouths
Even with 12 drinks, 3 starters, sushi platter and an entree, our total was low!
the food was bad and the waitress was disturbingly preky and explained to me what edamame and gazpacho was
the only redeeming thing was the drinks
big mistake to eat anything there
trendy for losers
I love all the drinks here
The bartenders are always great, and even though the drinks are pricey, for once in awhile, totally worth it
The problem is that by the time your table is ready, you will be a little buzz
Even with reservations, it takes forever to get seated
this place reeks of trendiness and epitomizes fusion-confusion
i can't even look at its obnoxious facade
stay away
Sushi Samba is a great place to go as a couple or with a small group of friends
The service is good, the atmoshpere is fun, and the food is delicious
The Chilean Sea Bass is amazing and the sushi is very fresh
I love it
They seated us immediately for our terrace reservation (8pm in a Thursday night, too - good job!) and the service was attentive throughout
Our group consensus was that the mixed drinks are definitely better at the Park Ave South location, although the menu selection here seems a bit better
The fish in their sushi/sashimi/tiradito was firm and fresh
Their take on beef negimaki (with hearts of palm, carrots and aspargus instead of scallions) was an outstanding appetizer
It was pretty loud so you could only really hear the people seated right by you, but this is definitely a fun place for a group party
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here
Overall, a very enjoyable time
The food and drinks were overpriced and our waitress a little pushy
The worst though was when she refused to cancel a beer SHE had forgotten to bring earlier, so we took our time finishing it
The hostess then asked us to leave because there was a huge waiting list
We're never going back
My friends and I have visited SS7 3 times
The first two times were great
The last time was in June
The service was HORRENDOUS
The waitress was suffering from a hang over which is okay, we have all been there, but then she proceded to get very rude and at one point said something that was very inappropriate
We would like to go back, but we will make sure the blonde is not working
I love coming here, whether it is for the sushi, drinks or to hang with friends
I love their sushi, it is fresh and unique
Very fresh sushi
Not very exciting menu
Great drinks though
A bit pricey
Try to eat on the rooftop
A good, interesting, fun and flavorful twist on sushi
Service is decent
Door policy, particularly for the upstairs seating and bar area, borders on pretentious (always a downfall waiting to happen)
I loved the decor and atmosphere of the place
It's bright, fun, and very lively
I would definitely recommend getting reservations as the wait can be very long
And you must order the ceviche and marinated sashimi appetizer
It was so delicious!!  We had another sushi roll called 'El T
something'
It has cheese on it, which seems strange but tasted so good
The spider rolls were way overpriced so I wouldn't order it again
And the mojitos
strong and very minty
I'd love to come to this place again
Very much worth the money and the wait
I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, service, and atmosphere
Almost everytime we have vistors fly to NYC - for a birthday, to close a deal, or just to wreak havoc after sundown - we get a big table on the roof
The mojitos are a perfect compliment to often inventive - but always gorgeous sushi
The deck is an oasis in that busy district, and when the weather turns they'll ease the chill with heaters
Although it can be pricey once you get going - the service is attentive and no one could think of having a bad time
New York needs SUSHI SAMBA 7 -- it has the best outdoor dining spot in the city
Located above the heat and exaust fumes of the city street, you can have delicious cocktails and great food while enjoying the cool breezes
It's like a mini-vacation
To party on the roof of this super hip hot spot, you must be cool
it makes you cool
Fantastic Food, Amazing Fun, Good times all around! See you there!
Wonderful fresh sushi
Great drinks
Incredibly trendy and hot crowd
The perfect place to meet a few friends after work for some drinks
and great sushi
You can't beat the crowd that is on the roof
It's a great end to a hectic day
you feel like you have escaped reality and are away from the stress of the city
I recommend!
Our meal at Sushi Samba 7 was fantastic and it was such a fun place
The rooftop was wonderful
very expensive, and the crowd was obnoxious (like watching a bunch of women who pretend like they're on Sex and the City)
we sampled the 'ceviche sampler' which was very good (not really traditional ceviche, but more like sashimi in acidic sauces) and two rolls--one with bell peppers (not very interesting) and one WONDERFUL roll with mozarella
we then left to fill up on ice cream before our wallets were emptied
i want to go back and try more, but overall this restaurant is sort of overhyped
I have eaten at Sushi Samba 7 for business and pleasure, during the winter and summer
This place works for every situation
The terrace is the perfect place to dine outside without being in the street
The food is extremely creative and the Latin and Japanese flavors match perfectly
The ambience really works well with the food
The food here is really yummy :) I tried the vegetarian sushi, coconut milk rice, veggie tempura, edamame and speared beef tataki and was VERY happy with all of my selections
Their edamame is the best I've had yet - sea salt with lime juice - soooo yummy!  The service was friendly and attentive as well
If I were to critique anything, it'd be that their paint job needs a touch up - it's not looking as sparkly and fancy as it once was
Dining here is like starring in your own episode of Sex and the City!
Sushi Samba 7 is a great place to escape it all especially in the summer
Sitting on the roof, makes you feel like you are out of the city
which is great!  The food is fab, the drinks are definitely fresh and perfect for summer
What a concept!
The best sushi in town, cool people, fun atmosphere is just a few of the reason
The food is the freshest and best Ive tasted--the flavors and ingredients combined with the food are both imaginative and cutting edge--Bring Brazil and Japan to NYC!!
This place is all about turnover
Eat and get out
I was there on a date and 15 minutes after paying the check they told us to leave! A joke

The food is as good as mama's cooking in the greek village
Some of the waiters are lacking good communication skills, but that can be overlooked in light of the great food and prices
This is the busiest Greek restaurant in Astoria also known as little Athens
The way I see it, the place to eat, is where most people go
This restaurant is good if you want to spend less than average and have traditional Greek food
If you do not like fast food the place is not recommended because you can eat better food nearby with not much higher cost
Uncle George's has been around for years- and it's no wonder why! Their traditional greek food is mouth watering and the restaurant itself has a valued greek ambience
The entire perimeter of the restaurant is glass- there are sliding glass doors which, when not too hot or cold, are opened for a nice cool breeze while you enjoy a great meal at a great price! The lamb is always tender and they have great salads and dips
I recommend the roast leg of lamb, barbequed pork, tirosalata dip, the steak, greek burgers, the shrimp entree, and the barbeque lamb just to name a few! The music is great and the service friendly
Come here for a HUGE greek meal at a great price!
I'm Greek and choose to go to Uncle George's whenever I'm looking for fast, delicious home-cooked food
The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it
Their salads are great, their tzatziki is wonderful, their pastitio is fantastic and their porgies (a type of fish) are always perfect
Not to be forgotten are their lemon potatoes which always hit the spot
Don't forget to have a carafe of their house wine, it's light and goes down easy
A friend recommended Uncle George's and so I had to go check it out myself
Unfortunately, it was very disappointing
The food had no taste to it, and the service was very bad
NOT recommended!
The second I walked in there was no one there to help me I had to hail down one of the waitors to seat us
The drink and food came really fast but getting a check was horrible
We asked one waitor to get the check then he sent another waitor to ask what we needed
The service is horrible
I got fed up waiting that I went to get the check and paid for it at the counter where my waitor was busy flirting with the cashier
There are many places in the up and coming Astoria, but uncle george's is one old school place you must try
Try the lemon potatoes, after you do you will find yourself craving from time to time
My favorite dish is the BBQ Pork
Simply amazing
So tender its mouth watering
The prices have not changed much in years
The service is friendly and some waiters even teach you a word or two in greek before dinner is over
Not to mention there is some greek goddess working there that is just gorgeous
A must eat!!!
Uncle George's can sometimes be very quick, and sometimes you'll be waiting around forever for no reason
You can always expect - good (but greasy) food, cheap, rude service
But the price is right - it's delicious and there's lots of it
Try the pasta with meat sauce or the half baked chicken with lemon potatoes
Don't fill up on the bread (thought that's good too)! Overall, what you see is what you get - if you were walking by and thought That place is crowded but it looks gross and I wonder why so many people eat here you'd know why once you entered
I was made to feel unwelcome from the moment I walked in
My waiter barely spoke two words to me -- that is, whenever he decided to actually see if I needed anything
I saw him having an animated conversation with some other customers, so I know he wasn't that way with everyone
The food was OK, but trying to get anything, like a drink refill or the check, was an ordeal, and this was when the place was nearly empty! Overall, a highly unpleasant experience service-wise, and an unmemorable one food-wise
Don't go here unless you want to be ignored, treated like a leper, or made to wait for every little thing
This is Astoria -- there are plenty of places to get better Greek food (and better service)
If you are planning to visit Greece don`t go there!!! Mousaka, one of the Greek special, is simply disgusting
and if it is not enough, you can try Souvlaki and you will swear not to go there anymore!Service is terrible too!!!
If you like barbeque meat and taverns,you can't miss this place
The best food I have had in NY
and it's incredibly cheap too
At one time this was Value Greek Food maximum
Not anymore
Wineturtle lives in nabe and is tired of friends who read the out dated reviews
Can not imagine and of the recent reviewers actually going in
The food has lost all the rustic charm it once had
IHOP for Greek
Last visit because Miss Subways insisted was food undercooked on the tail ond overcooked at the head,greenbeans thatare at bestgraybrown, soggy potatoes with way too much lemon and as limp as can be
Greeks do lamb best
Not here Not now
Notany more ! We morn the loss of a once great ethnic Greek
When I've got a craving for lemon potatoes, this is where I go
Great grilled meats, too
When you're done, go across the street to Omonia for dessert
Put them together and you've got a nice night!
Maybe it was an off-night, but the place had a very unappetizing smell of cleaner, grease and fish when we walked in
Our table was very greasy, even after it was wiped down in front of us
The warm octopus vinaigrette was chewy, not tender, we couldn't finish it
We also tried grilled chicken (not bad), fried whiting (fried too long, very greasy), taramasolata (too salty), chicken rice soup (oily mess), and an OK Greek salad
The service was warm, but it took forever to get the check
There must be better Greek places in Astoria
I love Uncle George's
The grilled/roasted meats can't be beat -- especially the kokoretsi (innards twisted on a spit and rotisserie-grilled into a semi-sausage -- it tastes a lot better than I can describe it)
And the retsina comes just as it should -- in tin carafes (and it's way cheap)
Uncle George's never closes, so there's no excuse not to jump on the N and come on over to Astoria
I highly recommend the fried calamari and the veal parmagian
they give you a huge portion, very nice! The service is very good, extremely perfessional
It's also very romantic
Most importantly the prices are great!
This is a great place to dine in Astoria
They offer a fairly large menu, the prices are spot on and the service is always top notch
No matter what you order, you're almost certain to get so much food you'll be leaving with a doggie bag
Make sure you try the Eggplant Rollatini, too
Yum
If you live in the neighborhood, you have no excuse for not trying it
We had a nice chat with the proprietor of the place and found out that he owns an ice cream factory and his company supplies ice cream to the Thai restaurants in Queens
You should try the homemade ice cream, its delicious!   The ambience of the place was quiet and nice but it could be a lot nicer
The service was warm and the owner was very chatty
It is a little pricey considering the food was just ok (except for their desserts)
nice place, good service but the price is a little bit more expensive when compare with the area, location and small dishes
This is indeed the place to be for an authentic italian meal
Unbelievable
People are amazed at how its been in Astoria since 1946
let me tell you, go in there, and you'll find out
It's the same Rizzo family, and they havent lost a step at all over the years-they've improved year by year
The food tastes great, and they present it beautifully and in timely fashion, even when they are busy
The service is there whenever you need them, very friendly
The decor is amaaazing
You feel as if you are in Italy right when you walk into the door
Wow
I don't think i can emphasize enough how good this place is
I strongly recommend you go and see for yourself

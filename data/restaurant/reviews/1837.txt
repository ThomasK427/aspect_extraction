Recently I had their soft shelled crab, it was extremely well prepared and for a reasonable price
Make sure you have the waiter bring chips and their peanut sauce to your table, it's to die for
Enjoy!!
The Scene Five Points' name is an homage to the infamous band of 19th-century street criminals whose headquarters were nearby, but there's nothing even vaguely derelict about this atmosphere
Outdoorsy elements make for one of the most tranquil settings around--in the center of the dining room, water trickles from a tree trunk, while light pours down through a skylight in back
The Food A wood-burning oven figures prominently into the hearty New American cuisine
The dinner menu changes daily, but dishes like duck breast with pickled Bing cherries, grilled lamb with yellow wax beans and tagliarini with squash blossoms and pesto are typical
The Sunday-only brunch is one of the best around, with first-rate wood-oven baked eggs rancheros and a beer-battered fried fish sandwich on brioche
The food was good but we were dissatisfied with waiting too long for a uncomfortable table
We made reservations and still had to wait almost 1 hour and the entire time we were being pressured to order drinks at the bar
I would go again, but my husband didn't like the attitude of the maitre'd Leigh
He seemed bothered by our requests to be seated and cold, despite the fact that it was our fifth anniversary
Went here randomly just the other night
Prices are decent
As an appetizer, we ordered the potato pizzette which is made of truffle oil
It tasted okay
A bit too much cheese and oil
The duck entree we had was good though
The meat was very tender, not dry at all
It just falls right off the bone, which I love
For dessert we had sorbet in the flavors of black plum, strawberry, and lemon
So good!
Nothing about Five Points sticks out in my memory as fantastic
but everything is really very good
Elegant but casual, good service, good menu, good food, neighborhood feel
Your dinner will be good, your wine will be good, your waiter will be attentive, the ambiance will be pleasant
Nothing will be overwhelmingly memorable or special but you'll leave happy
Good place to take parents or work colleagues, as the ambiance is sophisticated-casual-mellow but hip folks in their 40s to 50s
We had a great night at 5 Points - good service, nice wait staff, all in all a good experience
Most of the dishes that we ordered were excellent - good hangar steak, decent oysters, and the Potato pizza with truffle oil was excellent (although perhaps a bit overdone on the truffle oil, if that's possible)
However the Halibut was a disaster (and ironically, the most expensive dish on the menu)
bland, with a watery sauce that did nothing to add to the flavor of the dish, set on a bed of lima beans and peas which dominated the flavor
Not good
Otherwise it's a nice place to eat
I took my mother here for a Sunday brunch and it was excellent
Pleasant and serene atmosphere, with a running stream of water, cherry blossoms and an open kitchen that reminds you of a country home
The food was reasonably priced and of excellent quality
Great variety and interesting dishes, too
I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a delicious and unpretentious - but lovely - brunch place in NY
There's a table at the end of the restaurant that's situated right under a skylight, it's the perfect setting for Sunday brunch especially when there's sunlight pouring down from above
We had a party of 5
I ordered the fried chicken, which is buttermilk-dipped and fried to a crisp, juicy, leg of sin
I like this place
Went here on a date w my sweetie and it was great
the food was really yummy
i had a great endive salad which didnt have an overwhelming amt of dressing which is really nice and might i add rare for many restaurants out there
the pork chop was really good and huge so much so that i was soo full on barely half of it
the sauce was nice and not too salty but still very flavorful
the decor was cute
not overly trendy and in your face of trying to be cool but more comfortable and cozy
great place highly recommended
i really can't complain about this place but i also wasn't wowed by anything either
with an overabundance of great restaurants in new york, this one kind of falls into the cracks
Do not try to make a reservation for more than 6 people during brunch because Five Points kitchen can not handle it
There are no exceptions including advance notice
Beware!
Though I wasn't starving, it was still a bit surprising to find four (yes, FOUR) scallops on my plate for dinner
That's about $6 a scallop
Our waiter was pleasant, but seemed unphased at how long we waited for our meals and needed a gentle reminder to check on the status of our order
Even the dessert was long in coming
So while the food was good, the spotty service and scallops priced like gold will keep me away in the future
I'm can't pinpoint exactly what it is but I love this place
Never been for dinner but love the brunch - both the breakfast choices and the lunch choices are delicious and fresh
Service is great too! In the winter try their famous hot chocolate
It gets crowded at brunch but I never feel rushed and although you have to wait for our table, I don't mind waiting around because I like the atmosphere
The food was incredible, very amazing fusion and pricing was terrific
Can't wait to go back
Their bread was to die for
A wonderful layout on a cool little street and a neat garden too
We went for brunch, My simple green salad was a surprise
It was heart warming, what a great dressing
the best
I also had a tasty sausage, egg, buttermilk biscuit creation
Next time I go it will be for dinner because I suspect brunch night be the busiest time and our waiter was working very hard to keep up
We arrived at Five Points with high expectations
The hostess was extremely polite and accomodated our request to sit outside immediately
The server was dutiful yet insincere, the brunch drinks above average
My Caesar salad was by far one of the best I've ever had
However, I dined with three others, and our reviews of our food were mixed
I loved my smoked salmon eggs benedict while my boyfriend didn't quite enjoy his wood-oven baked eggs and sausage
Overall, Five Points is worth the visit
The block is very quiet, and as long as you keep the brunch beverages flowing, the experience overall is quite enjoyable
My venison was delicious
I liked the salads and the cocktails
Really nice service
But the room seemed to stuffed, and kind of boring
I think they need a decor overhaul
I'm fortunate enough to regularly sample NYC's best restaurants at business dinners, but I always come back to Five Points
It's flawless
I've never encountered a staff member that wasn't top notch
The atmosphere is wonderful, and the food - the food! The pizzette with truffle oil and telme cheese might be the best thing I've ever eaten, the pork chop is thicker and juicer than any I'd ever had and the chocolate bread pudding
well, you've never had anything more delicious
Bravo!
Excellent food and service in a lovely restaurant- all in all a wonderful evening
Made me forget the very cold walk over
I will definitely be back
Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our brunch experience
I wouldn't recommend large groups as we were all crammed into a corner booth, but otherwise, the space was lovely, particularly the running stream in the middle of the restaurant
Brunch becomes crowded quickly, so arrive early
I had the dulce de leche French toast which was sweet enough to be dessert but tasty and definitely something I'd order again

So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding

I'm not a coffee expert
it all tastes the same to me
When I go to starbucks I don't even know what Grande, Latte etc
means
But their coffee is ok, and they have couches and stuff so you can hang out and drink coffee
pretty cool I guess

I think that Starbucks coffee is wayyyyy overrated! I think that it tastes so strong
it tastes anything but fresh
and for the price you have to be out of your mind
I would like to know who made it sooo popular
cause personally I will drink Tim Horton's coffee any day!
whenever i'm in nyc i have to get some starbuck's coffee because it's the best
it's too much money for only a decent cup of coffee
I can't believe this commerical hype coffee company, actually made it on the best of the citysearch
I dont see why anyone but Tourists (and smart ones should know better), would go to Starbucks when there are so many good Neighorhood Coffe Shops in town
Possibly the world's worst gormet coffee,over roasted and over priced
starbucks coffee tastes burnt is overpriced
drink coffee in any southamerican or european country and you'll never be tempted to walk in one of the franchise stores again
Burnt, overpriced, and refills cost the same as the first cup
8 o'clock Rules
this stuff isnt coffee, i mean please!!!! go home, buy a coffee maker, grind some fresh columbian beans, and enjoy whats its actually supposed to taste like
these guys are just aggressive marketeers and overpriced
Whoever thinks Starbucks -- the McDonalds of the coffee world -- makes good coffee (and worth the outrageous price) needs to wake up and smell the coffee!!! The good stuff! The Porto Rico company can dance circles around Starsucks
Nothing beats Starbucks
It's the best coffee in town
for that matter
in the world!
If you are looking for a good cup of coffee, Starbucks is the last place you should go
They buy cheap burn beans, and try to pass that off as their special flavor (cmon it very obvious)- But if you want a burned beans, overpriced, snobby service coffee- then go for it
starbucks is so much more than coffee is it is the atmosphere
But is the coffee that comes to my attention i ma one the biggest starbucks fans  around
STARBUCKS IS THE BEST PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET COFFE
I LOVE STARBUCKS!!!!ITS THE ONLY PLACE I DRINK COFFE, IT IS SO GOOD!!!!!!
I really like Starbucks
They're always friendly, and they never take too long to take your order
Their cappucinos are the best!
The coffee here is over-roasted, leading to a burnt taste that can be confused by some people with a strong taste
Only their frappucinos are good!
I would like Starbucks coffee,if I didn't have to add so much half and half, sugar and vanilla to mask the bitter taste of its brew
But once I mix it to perfection, its a nice cup of Joe! I wish they would learn not to brew it soooo strong
I know one of their disclaimers is to add water if its too strong-after just ruins the taste
I order a tall in grande cup, grande in a venti cup, so once I add my concotion, I haven't wasted 1/2 my coffee by pouring it down the trash
My best cappucino is from a Spanish place in Brooklyn, NY-cafe conleche? its a dollar- cant beat that!
I have yet to have a cup of Starbucks Coffee that did not taste burnt !

Defently the best caramel mochiato i have drank in a century
Also I would recomend the tazzleberry its quite good
Nice enviroment, friendly romantic
the type that gives you a grab a seat and read or talk feeling
Thats probably why it is included in barns and noble's nation wide
It creats the friends enviroment
Concluding it should buy couches
thats basecly the only suggestion i would give
I love looking forward to starting my day at Starbucks
I swear, I wake up and think, OK, I don't want to get up, but at least I'll grab a Starbucks on my way to the office! That's a good thing!

It is the type of place you can come with a friend or a crowd (not too big because it is a small space) for great food,incredible wine and atmosphere
the mudstruckers really pulled it off
this is the greatest lil hang out in nyc
mud is still the best, the music is always rockin', the service beautiful and the decor 60ies mixed with old school elements
they have a backyard
their brunches on the weekends are awesome
they do a sushi night on thursdays and the rest of the time mudspot is kickin' out delicious breakfast lunches and dinners
i love it
check out the seasonal naked ladies party
girls only!
My experiences at the mudspot are never anything short of fantastic
Whether popping in for a quick cup of coffee, or hanging around with a glass of wine and a hearty bowl of soup, the friendly staff always make you feel at home
The music selection is eclectic and enjoyable
Overall this is simply a great place to hang out
This place has the best burgers in the city
Get the Bronte burger - it is amazing
The pasta is also great
I have been there several times and the food is always great
The latte's are also amazing
Really cool and chilled out place with great music
Perfect if you want a nice chilled out time
Loved this find
We had great service, amazing food, great atmosphere
Too bad others had bad service, we didn't experience this at all
In fact they brought our bill two minutes after we asked for it, they apologize that it took so long and took a $6 milkshake off the bill! It wasn't necessary yet they did it anyways
Loved hearing the Australian acents and cool surf-esque vibe
Worth checking out!
I love the food here
BUT THE SERVICE IS SOME OF THE MOST TERRIBLE SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
It's not like you don't get your food or anything
I've gone to this place 3 or 4 times now and EVERYTIME I eat there, the servers are just completely rude
(I gave this place enough of a shot, but NO MORE)
Yesterday, my girl and I walked in and stood there for about 2 minutes until one of the servers finally looked at me, I said, for two? he looked the otherway and said, yeah yeah, sit anywhere
There was another couple that sat down, waited for 5 minutes while the servers completely ignored them (mind you there was only us plus two other customers there)
After awhile, the couple just left! It's really too bad there food is so good because their service is just so completely horrible
You can hear the Aussie accents from the side walk! This place is great
Friendly service from ex-pats and food to die for
It may be small, but once you are seated, you have plenty of room and don't have to keep your voice down to keep the patrons next to you from eavesdropping
The owners are a friendly bunch and are often around for a chat
The coffee is excellent and burgers are fantastic - especially the 'Whaley Burger'
A must for all lovers of Aussie culture
Tiny restaurant with packed tables
The sandwiches are inexpensive and tasty
The coffee is great and alcohol is byo
Great place for a quick bite
The Australian accents are a plus too
After walking through SoHo for over an hour and pondering what to eat, my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised to happen upon Ruby's
This place is TEENY, but we didn't feel cramped at all
It was prime time on a sunny Sunday afternoon and we were seated quickly (although we did have to share our table with another couple)
The menu specials were outstanding: I had a fantastic pumpkin and arugula salad with goat cheese, balsamic vinaigrette, and pine nuts
My boyfriend enjoyed a delicious prosciutto and mozzarella panini sandwich
Everything in this place seemed light and airy
Highly recommended!
The waitstaff here is EXTREMELY rude - we had to ASK to be seated - once we were seated he was NOT friendly
I asked him for a glass of water and he actually ROLLED HIS EYES at me!!  The waiter just hung out with his friends outside and acted like he was doing us a HUGE favor by serving my food or taking my order
We were totally ignored
On top of all this my food appeared to be reheated pasta (not freshly made)
I was disgusted at the way we were treated at Ruby - I live right in the area and go out all the time and tip quite well
I will NEVER go to Ruby's again and would NOT recommend it to anyone
I love Ruby's
The staff of Australians are friendly and funny -- the food is incredible and very reasonably priced
A great neighborhood place -- still seems possible to get a seat quickly
Not for long, I fear!
Have been there twice now, and it is a real nice friendly place
It is a great place to sit down, and enjoy some coffee and dessert
They have food too
I have the meat pie which was very good
The music is great too
The place is definitely small, but that kind of adds to its whole atmosphere
Totally recommend stopping in for a bite
What a breath of Fresh air in Soho! Great food (sticky date and salads to die for!!)
From the seats in this place, if you listen hard, you can almost hear the sound of breaking waves at Bondi Beach
Fresh music, great food, young staff and excellent coffee add to a seductive brunch/lunch/ and (soon to be drink) establishment
My husband I both love Vietnamese food, and we have tried many of the restaurants in the city
Boi is utterly charming, beautiful little details, great ambiance - reminded me of some of the restaurants we had been to in Hanoi, that have more of a french-indochinese aesthetic
food here is really really good
the dishes are some of the tastiest vietnamese food we've ever had
yes, it's not cheap, but the prices are standard compared to other restaurants that have been opening up in the city the last few years
not sure what is meant by the user comment about prices being outrageous for this type of cuisine - does that mean only european cuisine should be allowed to charged prices in the teens to low 20s? service was great too - the waiters were extremely attentive
overall, very highly recommended!
I have eaten here many times now, and the food is always delicious
I made a point of taking my family when they came for a visit
Excellent food and service! I'm going for lunch today!
We will never go to this restaurant again and will never recommend it to anybody
The prices at Boi are outrageous for this type of cuisine
They charge $24 for entrees and ask additional price of $3 for rice or $6 for vegetables as side dish! The portions were so small that we still wanted to eat after dinner
They didn't give us any kind of bread or tea while we were waiting for dinner (25 minutes)
You would pay much less for the better food and better service
Boi is not for repeat customers
We just wanted to take out some food, but we stayed for the atmosphere in the restaurant: Good music, a zen surrounding and just enough light to read the menu
We had several different starters (e
g
papaya salad, spring wraps) that were delicious and with 6 to 8 $ not overpriced
The waiter's recommendation for the entree (seabass in a lime and mango chutney) exceeded our expectations and we ate the chutney to the last drop
We continued to indulge in dessert such as jackfruit toffee cake or tamarind cake
So far this dinner was the most delicious and elegant one, which we had in New York in the last few months
The waiters were attentive and dedicated much attention to little details (e
g
serving Mariage Freres tea and curling the straw paper
)

Dessert if important to you could be better
Must add a chocolate and berry something
Other than that A+ on serivce, lay-out, wine and food
Well, since this restaurant (which is really named Gonzo, meaning cool in Italian) only opened a few weeks ago, I'm wondering what the previous author wants the menu changed from?  Otherwise, this place is FANTASTIC - great food, good service, great atmosphere
Chef Vincent Scotto serves up another winner all around!
Paradise has apparently had a change in staff beacause my service was excellent, I got a smoothie and it was great, protein makes shakes airy so I stayed away from it and opted for a banana, peach and mango, excellent
I also got a sandwich, they've got all these great new breads, I had smoked turkey and brie on an onion focaccia, sooo tasty
Service was great!!!!! Great soups too!!!!!
Dedelman, I've been an NYC resident since '81, and I still hate this place
There is no excuse whatsoever for rude service, never ever
You come to a place -- whether it's the Olive Garden or La Luncheonette -- you give them your business, you pay them good money, and you expect to be treated like a valued customer, not a NUISANCE, which is how this place treated me
Just an awful experience
No kind of good food can justify that kind of behavior
But the thing is, the food here is not remarkable AT ALL
Just average
Not worth the visit
Don't go
Tourists, please
Do not come to New York and expect a resturant as fine as this one to bend to your every request
I had a meal with a party of 9 there and they were friendly and patient
The owner who many of you see as a jerk was wonderful, friendly and a joy to talk to
Stop complaining, or go eat at the olive garden in times square
Yes the service is a bit forward, but they are running a business and a successful one at that
Everything I have ever had there has been PERFECT
I had dinner last Saturday with a couple of friends
The food and setting were decent, but not spectacular
More notably, I had read the reviews about rude service, and well sadly enough, it's all true
Our waitress was one of the rudest that I have ever met! She acted as if serving our table was an incredible inconvenience, and she was downright surly
She alone is enough of a reason to AVOID this venue at all costs
Four of us went on batille day, i could understand the service being a little slower as they were stretched
but definitely could have done without the rudeness
typical french service, but working on gratituity
Standing near me a member of the wait staff complained that there was only one table that she didnt mind waiting on the whole night
everyone else was awful
The meat on two of the four dishes was so fatty it was inedible
They also ran out of many things as well
Good wine list
I was recently in Paris and found myself longing for the Cassoulet and Blanquet de Veau you can find at La Lunchonette
The chef and co-owner Jean-Francois Fraysse brings some of his family recipes from the Southwest of France right to your table
The food at this well kept secret is fantastic and the atmosphere is relaxed and has remained so, even after the arrival of the art scene to Chelsea
A real find!
So the owner may be crazy   The food, ambience, and yes the owners, make La Luncheonette a winner
The standardsfrom the leak lentil salad, through the roast chicken in mustard sauce, to the tarte tintinare classic
The wine list, with a great selection from the SouthWest, is well focused even better priced
The cassoulet is better than any I have found in Paris
And, the prices beat anything in Manhattan for food of this caliber
Don't go here, unless you like your waitress to snub you and the owner yell at you
When we pointed out that the margaritas we sent back earlier had not been crossed off our bill (they were terrible)- the owner started yelling this is ridiculous! We were dumbfounded
She proceeded to insult us, continued yelling at us from behind the bar (other customers could hear
)   This is a place that doesn't care about losing customers over an $8 drink
Also, throughout our meal our waitress never once asked us how our meal was
We had to wait nearly 10 minutes to have our plates cleared and no one asked us if we wanted to see the desert menu
All in all- unremarkable french food with the worst service I have ever experienced in my life
Seriously, if you don't want to have your evening ruined, don't go there
I felt relaxed the minute I walked in which is unusual for me
This is a real french country place in Manhattan
I went to Red Light recently for a birthday party and was impressed by its cool, comfortable, intimate feel
It was dark and sumptious, but you kind of felt like you were in your (really cool) friend's apt
There are big couches everywhere and the crowd was fun and unpretentious
It was just crowded enough to have fun, but not so much that you couldn't get a drink or move around easily
And a great jukebox to set the mood in the way you want!
The Scene Everyone receives a polite "bon soir" at the door; that welcome and the old fashioned charm of the dining rooms appeal to couples and close friends looking for a spot to enjoy quiet conversation
Dried flowers, cherry blossom branches and baskets of apples give a homey intimacy to the inside, while a quaint garden adds a literal breath of fresh air out back
The Food Unlike the many places dishing out upscale, fancy French food, the menu here specializes in the rich, heavy cuisine of southwest France, which means this is just the place to feed that cassoulet craving
Other comforting classics include garlicky escargot, delightfully drenched in butter, then folded into crispy bundles of phyllo, and duck confit packed with fatty flavor
If you haven't busted your buttons by dessert, the excellent profiteroles are bound to do it
Went back for the third time last Friday at 10:30pm because the wait for a table in the near by Caffeteria was 45 minutes
Two minutes later we were seated at a cozy table in the basement acompanied by the soft, wamr light from the garden
The food was delicious, and the waiter is attentive with cute French accent
We had lamb ,halibut with seadfood pastry appetizer - delicious
This is the place to go !!  Love it
Went on a Monday night, and I guess it was more crowded than usual
Staff was generally OK, but there were a lot of them running around and not getting a lot done
Our waiter was sweet, if a bit forgetful
Salads and appetizers were good, main courses fair, and desserts above average
Ordered wine by the glass, and it was quite expensive
Many of the restaurants on 8th ave
in Chelsea are mediocre -- this one is still a cut above some of the others
Went there on a Saturday night w/ 9:30 resv for 2
Seated w/in 5 mins
So much on the menu looked good - we shared oysters ($2
50/each), I had the duck ($25)
One word: mmmmm
Good-sized portions (not enormous, but not tiny), I left full
Enjoyed a bottle of white Bordeaux (2004, forget the name) with the meal, which complemented it perfectly
Service was impeccable: our waiter checked in on us often, but not too often, and water glasses were never empty
Very romantic
There were two bday parties, which might explain the noise - for such a small place, it was quite loud, but not unbearable
Romantic
Make reservations
Will return!
Gascogne is fantastic
The food is excellent, ambience cozy, and the staff is very nice
I have never failed to enjoy myself at Gascogne
Its price, usally 100 per person with wine, always woth it
Went with a friend for dinner there on a Friday night
Seating was very prompt
Food (duck breast, venison, pear tart) was absolutely delicious
Food prices are on the expensive side, but the wine list is reasonably priced
They also have a cute little bar up front with very cute Frenchmen

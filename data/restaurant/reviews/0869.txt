The persons taking the orders are very courteous and are always ready with a warm greeting (May I take your order sweatheart?)
Delivery times are good to fair
If you want haute cuisine don't look to Jerry's, but if your looking for heavy yet tasty, get your hands dirty food Jerry's might just be your ticket
I've been to this restaurant a few times when I make my way to New York (from Portland OR) for brunch - each time with the same person, and we both order the same thing each time
It's a very cute place, pretty small, with big windows so there is a lot of light
each time we were there, there was only 1 server so it was a bit slow, but I do have to say they have the best lattes in town! (When I am there, I go out to a different restaurant for every single meal, and each place I go I order a latte, so I know New York lattes!)
a great charming place on a quiet street in Chelsea - away from the main drag
An awesome place to stop in for dessert and coffee
Great people watching
The only downside is the service can be more efficient and serve with a smile
I love this cozy neighborhood nook for Saturday or Sunday brunch
It's utterly charming, full of locals on a quiet, delightful, people watching block of Ninth Ave
The food is delicious and the servic dependable, if occasionally a tad slow
A great place to catch up with an old friend over coffee and an omelette
I went to rafaella last saturday, and was so crowded!! eventough, the service was attentive, the food was so amazing, and the prices were even more! congratullations to the waitress!!
In Short This wood-covered, country-style shop and cafe is one of six locations owned by Sarabeth and Bill Levine, who have been selling homemade edibles since the 1980s
Their signature is Spreadable Fruit in 16 flavors, among them plum cherry, chunky apple and blood orange marmalade
The bakery also sells lemon Bundt cakes, banana cakes and crisp "cloud" cookies, as well as ham and cheddar and turkey and avocado sandwiches
For the price we paid ($8 over for pancakes with self-service), you would expect the food not to come in cheap plastic plates
They cannot even do a simple latte
There is perhaps the worst I have had, with more milk in it than coffee
desserts here are better than the other around the corner
the tarts, biscotti, cheesecake, etc
didn't like their cookie selection except for their rainbows
always buy their strawberry tarts for the wife
best is their italian ices in the summer! SUM IT: recommend this over the other ferrara's
but it is smaller cramp
My first sushi place in NYC and I was surprised that the menu does not offer sashimi dinners, instead, you have to buy each individual piece
Overall, the menu deserves more selection
Consequently, I would recommend this place for sushi beginners
Although this place might not look like much, this is my FAVORITE neighborhood place with great quality sushi, good prices and wonderful service
This might not be the nobo or sushi of Gari experience but for it is a PERFECT place to get your casual sushi fix
I don't know how more people have not discovered this place
What they lack in ambience they more than make up for in food and price, etc
The soups and sandwiches are pretty good, but the service is so poor it's almost not worth the effort
Extremely high employee turnover - they often can't locate the different soups
Register clerks get flustered and can't give proper change
Have noticed management has changed hands several times
Don't come in with a large order, did this once and had to go back to retrieve missing items
Not a great value for the money
Am I the only person that finds Hale and Hearty soups incredibly sweet? They must add tons of sugar or something, especially to their tomato-based soups
Normally I go here first when I'm in the soup mood, but I've found lately that I go there only as a last resort since their soups are way too sweet
This place is ok for the broth-based soups, but for their veggie soups, forget it, way too sweet
I'll give every place twice
Both times I've eaten lunch here I have been dissapointed
The chicken was dry and the beef was almost too chewy to eat
The place appears clean, and the service is pleasant and fast, but the food is below average
It's a shame because it is the only Thai restaurant for several blocks
The $7 lunch was tempting, but I won't be back
If you really like Pad Thai, this is NOT the place for you
It left me wanting, and I love Thai food
it was bland and didn't even have peanuts, the chicken was also dry
The ambience was nice, but all in all, I wouldn't recomment the place
We stopped here at 1:00 on a Thursday afternoon and selected a pre-wrapped sandwich and wrap that were quite tasty
The salad bar looked great
While there aren't many tables (Bryant Park is only 2 blocks away) we found one and were in and out in 15 minutes for $6 per person
The Best Churrasco -
- in NY, THE BEST Service also :)
Good neighborhood place for cheap eats
The seafood soup is delicious
Cubano is good but, Sophie's is way better
Overall, food is good, decor is average and service is excellent
If you are in the neighborhood, it's a good place to get something to eat
I eat here all the time! It's a great place to fill your stomach and escape the drudgery of work and all of its stresses
Try a Blue Havana! It will certainly get you in the right mood
There's an elderly gentleman that seats patrons from time to time - ask him for two Blue Havana's and you'll be off to the right start
Here are three things you are assured to get: great food, great service and great prices! Three cheers for Havana-NY!
One of the best places to eat in Hell's Kitchen
The food tastes wonderful and healthy
The atmosphere is cozy
One of the best brunch omelettes and health shakes I've ever had
Salads are tremendous and generous
And the value for your dollar is great
Old John's is a friendly neighborhood establishment
The food is reliably good standard diner food and the staff is especially nice
If you just want some good home-cooking from friendly people, this is a great spot
Super kid friendly too
We take the subway to frequent this place
Chinatown meets the UES
You can do lunch on a weekday for around $5 if you pick the right dishes (sm
hot sour soup and a roast pork bun were about $4
75)
The food is great and the portions of the entrees are large
We love the crispy chicken with scallions and ginger
I'm a serious sucker for the buns listed in the appetizer section: big, fluffy, feels like true sustenance
Iced green teas aren't the best deal ($4 a glass), but I do like the apple-spiked variety
Upstairs seating is gorgeous
Also, the service is stern but quick and attentive
A true gem on the Upper East Side
The tofu dishes are all great, and definitely try the steamed vegetable dumplings -- as good as Chinatown's, albeit at a higher price
The ONLY good thing about this place is it's weekday lunch special: for less than $7, diners can buy a 1/4 rotisserie chicken, a side of rice OR a baked potato, and a chintzy glass of tea or soft drink
But don't expect much more
There's hardly anyone who acknowledges your presence if -- heaven forbid -- you should desire a refil after chomping down on some tough, dry ribs
The fried vegetable tempura isn't bad, but not worth the wait staff's attitude
This certainly isn't close to the Dallas BBQ incarnation that once existed near NYU
We went here lastnight before watching a show and were very pleased
I had the Moqueca de Peixe and my husband had the Fil de Peixe com Camaro
Both were very good and the portions were perfect
We spent a week in Brazil so of course we ordered caipirinhas to bring back the feeling on relaxing on Rio's beautiful beaches
Overall, this is a great place to eat

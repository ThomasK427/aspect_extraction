for most of us natives, its the ultimate Yakiniku (BBQ) joint to enjoy a feast of meat for a reasonable price but with great service
Gyukaku succeeds in delivering one, which for budget ballers like myself unfortunately is the service
The meat dishes are small and overpriced, even compared to their Hawaii chain, they tagged on about $3 more for each dish
The food is good though, compared to K-town BBQ places, I think the quality of meat is good and you don't come out smelling like the food is a BIG PLUS
They should seriously consider up-ing the portion and making the entire Japan menu available (esp
the REIMEN or Nengmyun)
there aren't too much entree selection and thats what makes the bill go up!!
The place is really nice w/ Asian flair
Service was excellent, although the place was really crowded
Downside is, that although the food tastes the same, or similar to the bbq (yakiniku) restaurants in Japan, each plate comes with very little food
For example, for $8 garlic kalbi plate, which is one of the most inexpensive on the menus, will have only 5 sliced kalbi meat! Also, the drinks are expensive for the quantity
Although it felt good to eat food close to ones I eat at home in Japan, I was disappointed that Gyu-kaku, which is known for cheap and good yakiniku in Japan, turned into a trendy, less than reasonable restaurant in East Village
Having said the above, it's a perfect place to go eat if you are willing to spend over $80 per person
Service is good, and your date will be happy
Great prices great food! Service was slow toward the end but thats because they were jam packed now i know why : ) I don't even like asian food in general but this place was terrific - the sauces seasonings were off the hoooook! I loved their fried calamari full of flavor ,very citrusy with a spicy kick to them srved with a great spicey honey sauce
We also had the kafeer puff-with ground chicken also awesome
then i had the pork chop - was so good - very tender, big chop and grilled to perfection
also the volcano chicken was rather tasty
I will be back highly recommend it
u can't beat this place - great location, food prices - a real triple threat
Only thing is according to my friend its not traditional thai but who cares - it tastes damn good!
You feel like a valued guest when you arrive here
The food is great and the service is not bad aswell
A little bit crowded in the dinning room, but what do you expect for a Saturday night eating out in the city
Looks like a good place for groups
I cook thai food often, and this place does it justice
It's tasty and all the entrees are ONLY $8
It's not amazing food, but pretty good
I particularly liked the Spicy Basil Noodle (Drunken Man Noodle) dish
It's close to the heart of the west village, near the christopher st stop
Really nice waitstaff
Great Thai Iced Coffee
Check it out!
I had two parties at ILSE, the best thing was that the owner took really good care of us, we took all the menu's give them back and said bring out the food as you wish, all was wonderful, is as if you were home and mother is taking care of you
This is a gem of a thai restaurant
The food is stellar, and the prices are incredible
The environment is also very serene and calm, and the food is presented beautifully
It's a far cry from most thai restaurants
I dined here in a group of five, and all of us loved our dishes
I especially recommend the drunken man noodles and the pork chops
They're a little different than the typical thai food, and they were very good
The food is excellent to any palate, and friends who lived in Thailand for years swore it was authentic
The kitchen will cook to order if you prefer more or less spice
All the ingredients are fresh and very well prepared, and the menu has great options for vegetarians
Prices are low for the quality and quantity of food, especially in the area
The wait staff is patient and friendly and even accommodated our group of 10 with grace when I called ahead
Great service, great food, great value
Can't go wrong with Isle - some of the best Thai food in Manhattan! Definitely worth trying
I've been here a few times and have enjoyed each experience
Great neighborhood place with consistenly good Italian offerings
If you're a fan of vine-ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, look forward to it in late spring/summer, it's fantastic here (crouton and all)!
great meal for a great price
we had the tasting menu and everything was delicious
Just the right amount of food
would definitely go there again
The second I walked into Nonna, I knew I was in for a good meal
The decor was pleasant to look at, not over done like some restaurants I've been to
I went to Nonna on a Sunday, when you can get a course six meal for about $20
All the food was tasty, although nothing was exceptional
In all I give Nonna a thumbs up
i visited nonna a few nights ago
right away i noticed the warm, homey environment
we declined a two person table right next to the door, and the host offered us the next available table, which was a large one in the back in the corner, a wonderful change from the often snobbish behavior often found at other restaurants where they will not seat two people at a table that can seat four because they're waiting for that larger party that half the time doesn't even arrive
the portions were perfect, not over the top like some italian places, and the food was fresh and delicious, the service attentive but not intrusive
i very much enjoyed the rigatoni with wild boar sausage
nonna is a great neighborhood spot!
Went on a Sunday afternoon - great salad, really good service and cheap prices
Will def be back for dinner sometime soon!
i was wary of this restaurant given it's changed it's name theme what seems like 3 times in the last 5yrs, but nonetheless we went and really enjoyed ourselves
we were a little baffled that they had run out of mozzarella, but nonetheless we plowed out and we're very pleased
the chef whipped up a special cold antipasta plate for us that we could used as our entree of all three of us, it was huge awesome combination of flavors
also very happy with the pasta, the serving size wasn't monsterous which was very nice and the food was everything we had hoped
totally like it, no strikes against this place
I loved everything about this place: food perfect, service great, decor beautiful
I would recommend this to any one who wants excellent italian food
this is the place to go
Great place to eat
You can also eat outside on a nice sunny day
Wonderful relaxed atmosphere
I really enjoy coming here
Nonna offers a great 5-course Sunday night feast for $19/person
Good value and great food
I would definitely make reservations
Haven't been there during the week but would definitely recommend Sunday night dinner
Great spot, location, decor, drinks, food and excellent staff from the door to waiters
Good variety of people, I think this place down to every detail was excellent
It's very simple want to enjoy a very nice night out in a trendy spot and not tight on the wallet or purse KOI should be on top of your list
Located in the Bryant Park Hotel I had high, high expectations for Koi
The space is beautiful, trendy, chic, modern and airy, just the way I like it
The service was impeccable
However, the food wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be
The dragon roll didn't have any avocado, the baked crab roll was a little bland (prob would have bene better with a bit of hot sauce) and the spicy tuna roll was pretty good but, not mind-blowing
The Cod entree was very good but, my favorite thing ordered was the seafood miso soup
As far as fine dining goes
Koi, despite it's trendiness, falls a little short on food
This place is great!! This is a gem, one of the best restaurants in NY
Great atmosphere, amazing food, and wonderfull service
This place is pricey, but worth every penny, I would recommend it to anyone
If you have not been, you must go! Atleast once in your life
great service and everyone was friendly

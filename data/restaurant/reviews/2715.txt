I made my first visit there two days ago and have already returned! True, the ambiance is something out of Goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world! A definite place to visit in Fort Greene/Clinton Hills! Bon Magnifique!
Cino's is a wonderful Italian restaurant
The menu has all your favorite italian dishes and a nice variety of meat and fish dishes
The decor and waitstaff is not exemplary, but it is great when you are in the mood to escape the trendy restaurants that have taken over Dekalb ave
I highly suggest it simply because the food is delicious and you can have a very nice meal without the hole in your pocket
Old, old world
DeKalb Avenue is now wall-to-wall with trendy, nuevo-something restaurants, and many of them are very good
But there is nothing else like Cino's
Great authentic (like, the waiters are middle aged men who wear suits and speak heavily-accented English) Italian food for not that much money
You could say that the decor leaves something to be desired if you were a snob with no sense of history, but why would you wanna be like that? Cino's is grad and faded old-world, authentic in a world where authenticity is getting harder and harder to find
Yum
I grew up eating at this establishment and loved it
The food is wonderfully fresh and flavorful and reasonably priced
I now live in Maryland, but I make this my 1st stop whenever I hit the BIG APPLE
Hope you'll love it too!
I ABSOLUTELY HATED chinese food before I ate at Kum Kau
One night I was very hungry and was in the mood for Lo Mein noodles
I hopped on Citysearch and read the reviews on this restaurant
After reading I set aside my feelings about the typical Chinese food restaurant in NYC
dirty environment, greasy food, and the fear of the chicken wings being pigeon wings
Kum Kau is the OPPOSITE OF ALL THESE THINGS
Their food is fantastic
Please try it!
I personally prefer the General Tso's Chicken
However, there is nothing on their menu that is not made well and tastes good
This is the Best Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn
The fast food side stays busy
I have never been in there when there wasn't a crowd waiting for their order
But I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes
The best option is to call your order in ahead of time at the fast food side
I am part of a Kum Kau tradition
My family and friends adore Kum Kau
My father, GRHS, was quite a familiar face and now I'm also following in the tradtion of enjoying their food and service (Rebecca is great)
My husband and I have been loyal patrons of Kum Kau for the past 30 years and the quality of service, food, and hospitality is exceptional! In 30 years, we've yet to find a Chinese food restaurant that compares
There is a constant flow of customers; the kitchen area is opened (no plexiglass) for you to observe food prepration; the food is always fresh; the ennvironment is clean/bright; you are sure to meet up with an old friend or neighbor while you're there
They also cater! There's even a children's book written about this Brooklyn restaurant - Big Jimmy's Kum Kau Chinese Take Out by Ted Lewin
Unfortunately, I have not eaten in the sit down restaurant as yet (approximately 4/5 years old); but if it's anything like the take out, I can expect superb service
As the old adage goes, You've tried the rest, now try the BEST
The best Chinese food in NYC
PERIOD
Nobody is as fresh as Kum Kau
Seriously I will not eat chinese food unless it is from here
Everything is fresh
The food turns over very quickly
you may have to wait a bit for service but you will not be disappointed with the food
I live in the Bronx and everytime I come into Brooklyn I stop by for the chinese food!!! The food is great
I usually have the General Tso's Shrimp
nobody does it like they do it
I recommend this place to everyone!
Simply put
the best Chinese food I have ever had
I particularly enjoy the General Tso Shrimp
From what I hear, people who come from D
C
, California, and elsewhere all stop by Kum Kau when they hit N

Well worth the travel
Cozy atmosphere, good food and service, good place to meet friends for dinner and a drink
Park Luncheonette is poised to become the kind of place you integrate into your life, a relaxed urban haven you could visit several times a month
The atmosphere is relaxed and informal, the staff friendly, the chef inspired
Appetizers: The Smoked Salmon and the Grilled Shrimp while good proved not to be as flavorful as expected
Entrees: The Grilled Salmon is exceptionally good
The Vegetable Melange is light and flavorful with a sublime cauliflower puree; extra bread to sop up the gravy is required and cheerfully provided
Deserts: The Goat Cheese Pannacotta and the Blood Orange Sorbet are excellent
All the parts of the Crepe tasted great but I wished for less deconstructed presentation
To me the Chocolate Espresso Tort was dryer than I like and didn't have anything interesting to say for itself but chocolate mavens might feel otherwise
The Park Luncheonette is just getting going as a New American restaurant after a long history as a lunch counter
The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible
The food is pretty good and the kitchen is still working out the details, but it all all looks promising
Think one each of meat, fish, duck, chicken, pasta, vegetarian (skip this)
A small place with a nice atmosphere for a casual date or neighborhood dinner and drinks
Good, small wine list
Great ambiance and eclectic mix of people
They have really yummy desserts and their baristas are really cute
Fast and friendly service
Great ambiance and mix of people
The baristas are really cute too
Really yummy desserts and snadwhiches
Perfect hangout for Ft, Greene people-watching, reading or hanging with a friend
great coffees and pastries
I wish it were in my neighborhood!!!
I have been visiting Oskar for many years
Always had a good experience, but it doesnt mean that everything went perfect
But it is understandable! Oskar was very reliable in the area of food, and was able to create a great atmosphere
Even if their service was not top notch at all times, at least the wait staff was very accommodating and respectful
Until now
It seems the restaurant hired some new mgmt staff, which has no idea what hospitality is about
She should go under an intensive training, to learn that being forceful and loud doesnt make customers feel at Oskar
Also a table next to my family felt the change that this young lady brought We will just stick to the delivery option
It was my 3-yr wedding anniversary and unfortunately my husband and I didn't have the time to go out to eat, but I still wanted to have a special meal at home, so I decided to order out from Chez Oskar
The manager Sasha was extremely accommodating and welcoming and even sent over a glass of champagne to me while I waited for my order
The Mustard Rabbit and Lamb Shank were gorgeous! The side that came with the lamb was some sort of parmesan mashed potato and it was to die for! Their appetizers are very good too - the citrus salad was so refreshing
My husband and I were so thrilled with the food - we definitely will be going back to dine in
The restaurant vibe is very chill and you could tell that everyone who was eating there was happy with what they had
Tres Bien indeed!
I've been going regularly for about a year now and I'm still a fan
The food is always delicious and I feel really at home comfy in the booths
Best time to go is during the week or at night on the weekends
Brunch can be a little hectic

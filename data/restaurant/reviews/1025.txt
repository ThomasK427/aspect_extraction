We all had a great time
Sitting in a such a nice place you would think it would be on the expensive side
When the check arrived it was so little that we decided to stay a while and ordered some more wine
CHARMING!
Had some of the friendliest, funniest servers I've ever had
Their entertainment alone was worth the price of the entree
The garden is beautiful and certainly the site of my mext date
Food is priced very reasonably
Sometimes the front is a little chaotic, but once seated, the experience was incredible at a fraction of the cost i expected to pay
Drink menu looked very interesting, can't wait to try the willini next visit
Its not often that I spend the time to go back to these pages and write a review but this place was beautiful
Considering the ambiance and food I couldn't believe how reasonable my bill was
If youre in the west village or planning on going, make sure to leave enough time to catch some dinner at this restaurant
From the looks of this place's website one would expect a trendy New York Hotspot
Quite the opposite- it's a Bleeker street tourist trap with sloppy service and below average food
Their drink list is overpriced and the fish is far from fresh
If you want a great Italian place head to Da Silvano around the corner
my girlfriends and i stopped by on a thursday night and had a great time
food was good, but the drinks were the best part
some of the friendlier waiters/bartender i've had in nyc
i'll definitely be back, especially when the weather's nicer
right down the street from another favorite of mine, cafe figaro, cascata is a great place to go for drinks or dinner
staff is very friendly, and the prix fixe is a great deal
highly recommended in the summer, when you can sit in the backyard with the waterfall
My first time to Cascata was this summer to enjoy the gorgeous back garden
What brought me back was the great inexpensive food, fantastic drinks, and sexy waitstaff/bartender
Ladies, dress-up and head over!!!
I have enjoyed my several dining experiences at Cascata
In fact, it is my favorite restaraunt discovery in the last six months! I highly recommend this as a drink or destination spot
Especially try the Southern Dogg
The food and ambiance at Cascata is great
The staff is attentive and really friendly
Check this place out
In Short  This sizzling Sixth Avenue spot takes its name from Mexico's open-sided beach huts
And though West Villagers may be many miles from Mexico, they do their best to create a beachy vibe as they sip margaritas under the restauraurant's thatched roof
A mural of the horizon on the back wall enhances the south-of-the-border ambiance--as does a menu brimming with tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and tres leches
This restaurant has the best mexican food in the city, the drinks are great and the ambience and service is absolutely fabulous
I cannot say the same for the sister restaurant on the East side though!!!
We had a fabulous experience! We sat outside and tried all the margarita flavors--delicious! After a few too many, I left my license at the bar
Steve was wonderful enough to track me down and return it to me
Thanks!!!!! Highly recommend this place
If there was a beauty contest for food, these dishes would be finalists: they're vivid, classy, and well-presented
Must have appetizer: chalupas con chorizo casero
This is NOT your Taco Bell chalupa! Most memorable drink: the funky, bloody Maryish beer and tamarind concoction
It's one of those places where you want to come again and again until you've tried everything on the menu
This IS the best (and best-priced authentic) Mexican in the area
My boyfriend and I went there for the first time last night, even though we live right around the corner we never thought more of the place's looks
It has a nice outdoor area but for some reason it is a not very noticeable place
Well
what a surprise!! The are indoors is nice but simple, with pictures of old mexican movie legends and a wall covered with candles
The jukebox plays awesome music and the service is very god and attentive
But the food
the food is reaaaaally good, amazing fish tacos, a diverse and traditional menu with great mexican entrees that you don't easily find anywhere else in the city
Everything was fresh and delicious!! Overall it is the best mexican in the area!!
Stan Chen is right on the money with this one-- actually, I believe he's the one that introduced this place to me ;)
Anyway, I call this place my high end japanese delivery
If you live downtown, definitely grab one of their menus, make a phone call and relax in front of the tv while they pound the pavement to get to you (although they do take about 45 minutes on average to get to you)-- the in restaurant service is likewise very very good
Even their cooked foods are quite tasty
I personally love their rock shrimp tempura and black cod appetizer
A little known fact is that this place buys from the SAME fish shop as Nobu
I absolutely love this restaurant
The menu is very simple, but they make up for relative lack of culinary creativity with excellent quality of their fares
The staples are fantastic
edamame, tofu agedashi, and sushi and sashimi
I highly recommend the sauteed mushrooms, and the green-tea crepe for desert
Their seasonal specials come on a single sheet of paper, bringing freshness and culinary bliss
The staff is among the friendliest that we've seen in the city
always a smile on their faces and prompt, courteous service
I'm almost afraid to recommend this place because I don't want it to get too crowded for the times that we go there
There are 'hotspot' restaurants in the area with alot more exposure, creating too much hype for overpriced food
Takahachi has become our favorite neighborhood spot, with excellent quality, elegant, simple japanese food with an amazing staff to support it
The sushi and the rolls are average to good, but what I loved was the amazing service
You rarely get this kind of service anywhere these days with rude / absent waitstaff
The waiters were mostly Japanese women who were so demure and deferential, I felt I was in old time Japan
The hijiki appetizer was very creatively done
The rest was up to the mark, but nothing spectacular
The decor is very understated, reminds one of a cafeteria, but with interesting touches like gravel under the benches and a very cool bathroom with a sliding door
I seems they have purposely kept it simplistic to focus attention on the food, like Masa
I discovered this restaurant one night while walking through Tribecas
Since I live in BPC, good (really good) sushi, that is so fresh you crave returning is hard to find
I have also had a coupld of appetizers, besides the sushi that rival any sushi place I have eaten
It is my new favorite place
I highly recommend it
When I ordered takeout over the phone, they were so nice that they recommended I tried something new and to my surprise I loved it
Go soon!
My friend reccomended this place as she had had lunch there with co-workers
We went for dinner and were seated right away
The food selection was perfect and the wine selection was great
We had the shrimp and tomato bruschetta, which was unbelieveable! Great place to catch up with a friend or take a group!! I love my meal!
The scene of the crime for the latest Beastie Boys video, this hidden midtown Italian joint is definitely somewhere to check out
I admonish first timers to enjoy seating on the second floor terrace
Portions are fairly generous and everything is presented well
A well kept Italian-Argentinian secret in mid-town
delicious food, impressive wine list, inviting atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a wait staff that makes you feel right at home
If you haven't experienced Sosa Borella mid-town, you are missing out
For a truly memorable dining experience, ask to be seated in at one of John's tables
you won't regret it
tell him Carmine and Vincene sent you!!
Blondies is the only place for Ohio State football
If you went to OSU and miss the feeling of Heiny Gate and Varsity Club, then look no further

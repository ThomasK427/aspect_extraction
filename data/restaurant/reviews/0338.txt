My fiancee had calamari and the house specialty Zuppa di Pesce
It was magic! The gnocchi floated off the plate and I stole half my fiancees calamari
I couldnt stop eating it!! The Sicilian wine was perfect
They opened the Zuppa just like the fairytale pie, all the flavors steaming out
I was jealous until I tasted my lamb, then I got busy with my spoon and enjoyed the Zuppa too! The table next to us ooohed and aahhed over an amazing chocolate souffl that we'll go back to try
We give Palma ten stars! But recommend you go somewhere else, we want to keep this Mediterranean haven all to ourselves
I've eaten in the restaraunt twice and really liked it
Upon my last visit, I discoverd the carraige house and knew it was a perfect place for my bf's suprise 30th
We had 16 people for a full sit down and it was perfect
The staff becomes like family for the day and let's you be as involved or hands off as you like
There were personal touches for him everywhere, and THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE
Even though the party was in September, we still talk about the sea bass, the jumbo spicy prawns and especially the homemade mushroom raviolis
Palma herself was delightful and the staff was as accomodating as I could ever imagine in NYC
We even survived the hurricane happening outdoors!!!
Attended a birthday party here at the back of the restaurant
The ambiance was nice, but our group did not have privacy
We kept getting interrupted by various people walking in the kitchen and the owner's dog was noisy
The waiter racked up our bill by charging us a cutting fee or a plating fee for the cake (we could have cut it ourselves!)
Completely overpriced and overrated
Have your party somewhere else
I haven't had food this good-primi or secondi-since Taormina Sicilia
Friendly and Intimate - JUST RIGHT!!
food is wonderful but not worth waiting for 45 minutes past your reservation to get seated
also not worth being told after your entrees come that they're out of the appetizer you ordered
also not worth being offered free desserts for the inconvenience but still getting charged for the appetizer you never got
I have now eaten at Palma 3 times and have enjoyed it more each time
A couple weeks ago I was there and the service was slow as they had a large party in the back-they made up for it with a round of free drinks and a free order of lamb chops
The food is exceptional and very reasonably priced for the area
It is small, but comfortable
The artichoke appetizer is phenominal
This is the kind of place I will eat at frequently and probably never tire of it
Had dinner there the other night and it was a true delight
I loved the rigatoni bolognese, it tasted just like being in Italy
They also had tiny Maine shrimp that tasted like nothing I tasted before
What a treat
My friend had the Orata and he said that it was the best he has had in the city
The staff was friendly and relaxed and the atmosphere was cool
I have a feeling that before long this place is going to be hard getting into!
Francheso the chef should be WORLD FAMOUS! The food is so delicious, try the fried artichokes and you will be back for more!! The fish soupm lamb chops and everything I tried is always topnotch
The street is crowded with many other restaurants but none shine as bright as Palma
Palma, is the type of restuarant I love to discover in NYC
It'a appeal goes far beyond the obvious ultra cool clientele
The food is outstanding
The staff is friendly and professional
The ambiance is more Mediterranean island than West Village
Palma, is the perfect addition to a neighborhood full of so so restuarants serving uninspired food
Interesting and somewhat hard-to-find restuarant in the East Village
The not-so-great; Small, very dark and inexpensively decorated with a potential for winter chill when the single door opens
The good; interesting and wholesome types of Italian, with seafood feature (try the fish stew), friendly (a bit raw) wait staff, and reasonable prices in a great area to just wander after a delightful dinner
A friend and I came here after trying to grab a seat at Pearl Oyster Bar down the street to no avail
We were seated at Palma right away, and even though the service was slow, it was friendly
Branzino here was just ok - I spent half my time trying to pick the bones out of the fish - it was much better at Raoul's in my opinion, but my friend's lobster linguini was delicioso
Aesthetic is pretty bare bones, but dim and candle lit
Restaurant itself is pretty intimate, if only b/c it's so small
The house speciality Branzino (whole or fillet) fish is excellent
Everyone ordered it! Very fresh
It was a little tough trying to get the bill at the end of a very nice meal
I threw my sister's bridal dinner at Palma and was so pleased with every aspect
The food, the service, the ambiance, and the people at Palma are incredible! I picked the restaurant off this site and can tell you that the pictures shown do not do the restaurant justice
I was initially nervous planning a dinner in NYC from San Francisco, but after speaking to Jacqueline (terrific in-house party planner) was more comfortable with my choice
that comfort moved to amazement when I saw the place in person
We had drinks in the courtyard and moved into the little cottage/kitchen at the back for an incredible meal
The room was brimming with flowers and what seemed to be a hundred candles
it was so beautiful! Everyone had such a great time!  PS Order the berries and meringue! DELICIOUS!!!
On a busy street (for French restaurants), Palma sticks out as probably the best one (and that's saying a lot with PO and Home within feet of the front door)
Definitely worth checking out for between 2 and 6 people, but I'd be concerned with a larger group
The things I love the most about eating at Palma are the homey atmosphere, the exceptional service, and the big bowl of cherries on the bar
My eight year old daughter made fast friends with Palma's beautiful daughter and her friend, who were playing in the courtyard out back
Not only did my husband and I appreciate the quiet, but we also adored the food
We highly recommend the grilled meat platter, which is fabulously prepared and portioned generously
And try the spicy shrimp -- excellent
This is truly an escape to another place
Nice atmosphere with a great airy feel to the place
Service was helpful and not pretentious at all
Seafood is terrifc and the pasta dishes were good too
Try the spicy seafood antipasta or the mixed seafood platter
I had a great dining experience here recently after locating thier website on Citysearch
Strongly recommend heading out to this location and trying it out
ALL good
Good food, service and ambience especially when shared with good friends
Hidden away in the W
Village Palma looks low key but packs an excellent food punch!! All the food is hand picked, start your meal with a glass of wine and a nice bruscetta
I have had the spicy pasta with seafood!! YUMMY
Crispy eggplant bites as an app were a new idea and great
Our server was honest and attentive
I think we stayed 3 hours and didn't even realize it, chatting, drinking wine
No pretentiousness - just good food and a great atmosphere
Palma is famous in the fashion world for their catering and now we're all lucky that they opened a cute restaurant in the West Village
My favorite is the spicy seafood pasta, it's the best that I've ever had! All of the seafood is exquisitly prepared and all of the ingredients are of fine quality
Every person that I've sent there can't beleive how wonder everey dish is
Try the boulibase and the fried calamari (lightly fried with fresh calamari)
Overall, my experience at Palma was good, but I was a little disappointed considering all the shining reviews here
Bruschetta was chewy (bread was not toasted) The cavatelli with veal ragu and mushrooms was hardly different from your run-of-the-mill bolognese
Seafood, however, was excellent, and is definitely the restaurant's strongpoint
The seafood stew and grilled branzino were excellent
But priced between $22 and $28, there are better restaurants around
Desserts were uninspired
This was my second time to dine at Palma and the food and experience only got better
To begin, my friend and I started off with the fried calamari and a chased it down with a nice glass of red wine
For my main I had the ongelet steak, hanger steak, which was grilled to medium rare perfection

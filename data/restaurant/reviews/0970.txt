Please save your money and go somewhere more fun that's a better value
From the number of empty tables at Masa, looks like everyone else did
Yes, the prices are out of this world -- but so is the food, the service, and the experience
From the sublime tastes of the master's extraordinary cuisine to the exquisite service and simple surroundings, this was one of the most delightful dining experiences I've ever had
It is a restaurant which pleases those with a discerning sushi palate to the sushi novice

It is a restaurant which combines traditional, conservative Japanese culture and fuses history into each dish
The room although tempered, speaks boldly with its understated elegance
The Sushi was of the highest caliber, the cut as if a master samurai marks smith was behind the bar, and service, just what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, New York style
If you havent already, although pricey, add this sushi shrine to your canon of sushi experiences
It can be said that this restaurant, introduces the United States to Sushi because only after you have experienced the culinary genius of Master Masa Takayama, can you depart savoring the flavors and knowledge of your new found education
My expectations may have been too high, but for the same price as Masa, you could eat at Sushi Yasuda and Sugiyama and they would both be better
Sure the fish is of the highest quality, and some of the fish served I had never heard of, but at $300 + it just does not justify the price
The decor in the restaurant, is nice, it completely lacks any sort of atmosphere
Sushi and Kaiseki a-fish-ionados, spend your $ elsewhere
While definitely a unique experience, nowhere near as good as Nobu
The sushi was excellent, but after a while it is overkill
I much prefer Nobu's testing menu where the focus is unique creations and one sushi course
At Masa, prepare for a ton of rice and seaweed
The decor was nice in terms of understated simplicity, but it was eerily quiet
The staff was attentive, but almost nerve-racking as they quickly rush up to your table and then turn and speed away
There were only 16 people in the restaurant on a Saturday night - not a good sign when you are charging $300/person
Stick with Nobu - you won't be disappointed
With pretty much 1 seating per night, you are almost guaranteed great and attentive service
Where else will the waiters respond to you by name after you check in and actually stand next to you to cook the lobster and foie gras shabu-shabu for you
Food is also sublime
Everywhere else, toro is considered the top-of-the-line sushi, at Masa, that is considered the lowest grade
There is an obscene amt of toro in the toro tartare and in the toro roll
Some other appetizers fell short of expectations though (ie, good, but not worth the price), like the tempura and veggies
Although very expensive, dining at Masa is a special experience
The food is different, incredibly fresh and prepared with great care
The cooking is almost done one on one and both Masa and his staff are very personable
Definitely worth it to try once or for very special events
The Scene A long, dim hallway transports diners to the bar, where beveled mirrors and embossed leather banquettes provide a dash of retro glam
But it's in the dining room, where confident cooks move about the showcase kitchen, and seamless service attends to the most mundane necessities, that the restaurant's overall excellence is fully expressed
The Food Chef Gray Kunz's hearty country French fare, with its unexpected, intriguing spicing, is simply excellent
He wows with vitello tonnato, a tuna aioli spread over thinly sliced raw veal, and with fresh sheets of pasta, laid over incredibly sweet tomatoes and lush olive oil
Pork shank, braised in chocolatey stout and maple syrup until buttery soft, is everything a winter dish should be
But it's Kunz's famous beef short ribs, marinated in a sweet-tart tamarind-mango mix and piled atop the world's best butter-laden grits laced with savory mustard, that will blow your mind
Fantastic spot for entertaining business clients or a night out with good friends
The room is alive with energy and the food is among the best I have had in New York
The service is professional but not pretentious
I hosted a closing dinner at the chef's table that my clients still talk about, it was worth every penny!
Had dinner a few nights ago with an unforgiving skepticism
Having read many reviews I cant believe the experience I had with my date
Started with the shrimp and risotto to start, both were lovely
Our entrees were the snapper and short ribs
Both were delicious
The zenith of the meal was dessert
The key lime pie was surprisingly lucious and the rum toast was unbelievable
The chef's flambe of the toast was impressive as flames nearly licked the ceiling adding a sense of professional execution for an open kitchen's theatrical performance
In addition the tasting of sorbet and ice creams were sent as complements from the pastry chef
All delicious, particularly the granite
Blood orange seemed a little bitter and unpalatable for me or my date
Overall great experience, thouroughly enjoyed watching Chef Kunz command his team with his Swiss precision
Will be back, thanks Jorge, our captain!
The kitchen is the centerpiece in this restaurant, in fact it comes between the diner's view of central park
Which isn't a bad thing because it adds to the experience
I'd recommend sitting by the kitchen so that you can still have a view of the park as well as the interesting ongoings in the kitchen
Food is good
I had the prix fixe lunch, which was very well executed, tasty and is of a good value
The bar/waiting area has an 80's Parisien brasserie feel to it
The dining area is elegant
Service was sufficient
The brunch menu wasn't as exciting so lunch is more recommended
Overall, I had a nice leisurely experience at this place
we were squeezed in between loud tables in a loud restaurant and never really could hear each other
our request to move was denied
the appetizers were good and the short ribs were very tasty
the lamb was composed of 2 small ribs and an unappetizing and inedible ugly piece of the leg
Horrible dish
Service was mediocre as we had to wait long between courses
It was as if we were forgotten
No wonder what used to be a very hard reservation was so easy
the restaurant was no longer full
Wait staff would not really engage at all
Bad experience
I had a wonderful lunch at Cafe Gray with my boyfriend recently
The service was very friendly and attentive, and the view in the afternoon was wonderful
My boyfriend loved watching the open kitchen
We had the chef's signature risotto (buttery and rich) and short ribs (tangy and delicious), as well as the cod and pasta fiori
The menu changes seasonally, but the risotto and short ribs are always available
The desserts were lovely, our favorite being the many flavors of sorbets and ice creams
All in all it was a fabulous meal! I will definitely be bringing my parents to dine, and would recommend it to anyone
The bar is also great, with banquettes available on a first come, first served basis, and a full menu is available in there as well
After reading the reviews, I was prepared for the worst
But I was pleasantly surprised
The staff was professional and courteous, and anticipated your needs
The appetizers(especially the boullabaise) and dessert (creme brulee and baked alaska) were amazing! The coffee was average
I would recommend the seafood dishes over the meat - the latter tended to be dry
The place was almost empty when we arrived (noon) but by the time we left (3PM), it was packed but not loud
The view of the park is so-so - the restaurant would have to be at a much higher floor to really get a wow view
Overall, I was highly satisfied
Wait staff were unprofessional and snobby
Ordered wine by the glass in order to sample several varieties - glass was barely 1/4 full - rather dissappointing at $17/glass
Menu selection was limited
Guests we were entertaining were not impressed and we were embarrassed
Have had much better service, food and ambiance at many other NYC restaurants
People has different taste, but I must say the decor was pretty hideious and worse, too crowded
Tables were too close we could hear every single word from the corner table next to ours

We would recommend it highly!
I didn't eat here ( although I tried, but the kitchen was closed by 11:30 on Friday evening), but Rosies is our favorite bar in NYC because of the great selection of draft beer, the courteous and skilled bartenders and the interesting people that you are likely to encounter here
Went into the City to watch a play this weekend and my girlfriend and I decided to try O'Grady's
The food was excellent and the portions were good for the price
The drinks were a little over priced
The waitress only stopped at our table to take our order and pick up the check
I had to ask another waiter to get me another drink because our waitress never came back to our table! The other servers, from what I saw, were doing excellent jobs, I just think/hope I got the short straw
Top notch chicken parm pizza, good pepperoni
Thin crust was excelent
UNREAL LUNCH can't go wrong with pastas or sandwiches, thin crust pizza is good, would steer away from the deep dish
Great place, only negative is it is a tad expensive for lunch
the food here is great it has such a variety and for the money I think it the best around
Mangia is the perfect lunch spot
Always crowded but you'll never wait long, this place has it down! The food is always delicious and the menu varies quite a bit with daily specials
It combines the elegance and charm of a European Bistro with an immense selction only available in New York
Try it for dinner!
Consistently good Chinese food is hard to come by in NYC
Imperial Dragon has everything
GREAT food, service ambiance
They even make the mooshu in front of you! Reasonably priced as well
definitely #1 on my recommendation list!
The Scene A clubby lair for corporate kings and media celebs, this expensive former speakeasy hasn't been altered since the La Guardia administration--oak bar, red-leather banquettes, neighborly tables and a curious collection of model trucks and airplanes dangling overhead
Old-school waiters in crisp white jackets anticipate every need, as does the unpretentious sommelier who oversees one of the city's great wine cellars
The Food Some of the most popular dishes have been on the menu forever, such as the exceptional Caesar salad, steak tartare and bouillabaisse
You won't find a better grilled Dover sole anywhere, and game (get the mixed grill) and layered, lusty sauces are other house specialties
The kitchen also tackles more au courant fare: Go with the black sea bass with truffled potatoes and the lavender-and-honey brushed roasted duck
For the price and quality of the food we got, I would not dine here again
As a steakhouse, I'd say that 21 is average at best
As a tourist attraction, I'd say it's above average - past reviewers are correct in saying there is a great deal of wonderful history here
However, it takes ages to get seated (even with a reservation), and the waiters don't seem very knowledgeable about the menu (or receptive to questions)
Oh - and the past few reviews posted here seem to all be from the same person/group
Kind of fishy!
As usual, the 21 Club lives up to its high standards and excellence
Everyone was impressed with the dinner and how it was organized
I explained I could not take much of the credit as my private dining sales manager had a great deal to do with the success
Everything from the cocktails and appetizers to the dinner and the wines were outstanding
Everything was perfect! All our guests were very pleased with the evening
Thanks to the staff for helping create a sucessful event
Be assured we will be back soon!
I had the most gracious experience in planning an event with the 21 Club
I was planning on a small dinner in a private room at the 21 Club but I had no idea what goes into planning an event but I picked the right place because they knew exactly what to do
My dinner started out as a 10 person dinner that ended up growing to 30 people but they were able to pull off a miracle for me
The room was great, the food amazing and the lady that I worked with was such a pleasure and really walked me through the process and told me everything I needed to do
They pay attention to every detail so I did not have to and that was a good thing because this could have been an embarrassing disaster if my clients did not have a place to sit
A million Thanks to the 21 Club for making me look so good
21 Club was such a wonderful venue
I am new at my company and my boss asked that I plan a very important client dinner, I was so afraid that I would loose my job if everything was not perfect
The 21 Club Event Managers made planning this very high level event so easy and I really came out looking like a star for picking such a wonderful location
They were attentive and took care of every detail for me, the room was beautiful, the staff was professional and experienced, the food was excellent the Filet Mignon melted in my mouth
My boss was so happy when almost every one of his guests called just to thank him for such a wonderful and memorable evening
I would just like to send a BIG THANK YOU to everyone at the 21 for making me look like the worlds best planner
I must say that the 21 Club is a gorgeous location for second weddings
They have so many rooms and are so easy to work with
I was planning my wedding at a really busy time in my life and did not have the time to really focus on the wedding but Thank Goodness for my planner at the 21 who made it all so easy
She took care of every detail from planning the menu, ordering the Jazz Trio, and even the Flowers and Linens we were in the Jack Room which was just absolutely the most perfect room for a small dinner
Everything was just perfect from the dcor to the food, service and everything that I am planning on having every big anniversary with the 21 Club
The service at 21 is extraordinary
We had 6:00 reservations in order to make it to an 8:00 curtain time
The waiters and maitre d both made note of our theater time, and ensured that we were not late
The food was great--the price fixe is an excellent value--and the atmosphere is so charming
You can really feel the history of the place
I loved the old-school feel and would definitely go back
The salmon was delicous!
Having never tried only the most exclusive of all places, 21 Club, my expectations were quickly shot down by their overly rude customer service reps on the phone
Despite their awful manners, I showed up on time only to be treated like garbage by the host and the servers
What really sparked my fire unfortunately, was the poor service, dark atmosphere, and the very bland food
For the money that one would pay for this, you'd think the lamb shank would be tender instead of tough, the 21 burger would be at the very least better than a fast food joint (but it wasn't), and the chicken breast cooked with a little less salt
The only bright spot of the night were the (expensive) desserts
They were tastefully decorated and tasted light and sweet
I don't believe I'll ever be coming back, unless if someone pays for me
A friend came into town
Dinner would be 21, Le Cirque or Elaine's
Unfortunately I chose 21
I ordered a seafood dish but was served with a very tender beef dish which I had inquired about earlier
Rather than disrupt the evening, I said nothing
With appetizers and drinks the bill came to $200 before my generous $50 tip
The maitre'd accidentally kicked my chair, saying nothing
I guess I had failed to tip the right person earlier
My friend enjoyed the evening unaware of my concerns
Silence is golden but now I'm happy to have the opportunity to express my disappointment to anyone who might consider dining at 21
Perhaps the wrong order was intentional? How childish
In the restaurant business, food is entertainment
The atmosphere was pleasant but these problems will prevent me from returning
I went with a group of 10 to 21 club last night to try it for Restaurant week was very dissapointed
During Restaurant Week eateriers offer $35 three-course dinners, which compared to their normal prices would be a bargain
Instead, we recieved mediorce assemblyline food, and overpriced drinks
The only options were lamb shank (which tasted like it was a frozen dinner) burger (which tasted way too gamey) and a chicken that I was told was unimpressive
We had waiters who brought us out bottles of sparkiling water which no one ordered which came to $50
The waiters seemed annoyed we all ordered the restaurant week menu and were going to cut into their tips
I will not be going back and wouldn't recommend it
From what I hear the whole restaurant week is a dissapointment wherever you go
A fabulous restaurant with great history
I loved touring the old hidden prohibition wine cellar
The sommelier was wonderful and so was the food
A real NYC Classic, The Maitre D' is rude and lucky he has a job there he needs to be in the back washing dishes! When you pay top $$$ you need to have someone who knows how to handle people, this is a Classic place not a Tandoori fast food place in Queens!  I go often but now just to the bar because the bartenders are the best and pour a great drink
I've been living in NYC almost my whole life yet I've never gone to 21 Club
Now I know why: below average and inconsistent! Although the restaurant has a fairly good NYC feel to it, the rest should never be representative of NYC
The veal chop I had was flavorful albeit overdone, and my wife's poached lobster was bland
What really bugged me is that the diner next to me, who ordered the veal chop as well, got a portion 2-2
5 times thicker! For $40-50 per entree, this was not a good value at all

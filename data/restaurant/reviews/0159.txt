I would probably go back in a couple of months, but I would order a la carte
For the getting-to-know-you stage of a first date, Annisa can't be beat
from great to bad and it's hard to imagine
Some of this food is among the finest in the city and other dishes are shockingly bad
The chef is garnering a reputation but I liked her better at the Asian place, Mirezhi(sp?) she was at
The female wine and alcohol list is interesting but
desserts left us cold as did the room
Still, we'll keep trying to because the promise seems to be hovering just out of reach
Deeply, deeply expensive
from the food to decor to service to wine list, everything was top notch
very classy place, without being stuffy at all
great servers, great dessert! easily the best meal i had in the 2+ weeks i spent in nyc
food was great, especially the zuchini blossoms in a picadillo pepper sauce
fish was generally better than meat
go before it gets expensive
one of the most serene dining experiences I have had in NYC
The food is excellent and the ambience is very relaxing even though the restaurant is located in the West Village
This cute little place just down the block from the ever-popular ONE IF BY LAND TWO IF BY SEA is another reasaon to come to the village to eat
These are my two favorite restaurants!! - Annisa is a great place for good food and good conversation
I highly recommend it
All the hype is just HYPE! Overly seasoned food, undersized portions, slow service
Ease up on the anise in the foie / dumplings Anita

Fillet was a joke, you think a little veg or starch would be called for but instead we got a rich veal jus spiked with Soy???? Anyway save your $168 for 2 with a $ 32 wine and run over to the Corner Bistro and order a couple of Bistrot Burgers like we did but only after wallets had felt the pain
I just moved into the neighborhood and I'm already in love with Toast! It has the best burger and best beer I've had in the city and has such a friendly, neighborhood atmosphere, you almost doubt that you're in New York City at all
I've been three times now
The chicken pasta and burgers are a must--the calamari and quesadillas are mouth-watering
The service is the friendliest you'll get anywhere
If you see a waiter with blue glasses, ask for him--he's attentive and super nice
And at $2
50 a pint during happy hour, this is the place to drink on a hot summer day and meet new friends
Want a drink after work without paying a months rent? Toast is the place to go
The staff is friendly and customers are diverse
Simple and to the point
They give you good food, affordable prices and a couple of TV's so you don't miss the Yankess win or the Knicks lose a single game
And the waiter Kevin is a cutie pie!
At happy hour, brunch, and dinnertime an eclectic mix of students, locals, and families fill up Toast
The main draw--burgers, sandwiches, and fries are usually delicious (though, acknowledging a previous reviewer, they're sometimes disappointingly average)
When they are good, they may ruin you on other burgers forever
The beer selection is also excellent, making it a great place to kick back after a long hard day
This place is a staple for the Manhattan School of Music students in the area
Great happy hour prices and selection of beers! The food is not overwhelmingly special, but is good for the price
I recommend the burgers, specials, and the Grand Marnier cheesecake
Also, any appetizer is better with their chipotle mayo! Service can be slow, but the staff is accomodating if you are in a rush
Contrary to what you might conclude from some of the earlier reviews for Toast, the food and service are not bad
The food is delicious, especially the sandwiches, which can serve two if you're not starving
Order a side of the chipotle mayo with your fries, it's divine
The beer selection is well above average
Sometimes the service is a little inconsistent, it's true, but they make up for it by being unbelievably friendly
Some Friends I visited Toast The Day After the Insane NYC Blackout
We were prepared for a rather disheveled experience as much of the city was still a mess
We couldn't have been more wrong
Our Toast Experience was SUPERB! My Buffalo Chicken Salad was huge and utterly delicious
So much food for a very low price
The Service was the best I've ever had in the neighborhood in a long while
Shane was my waiter, and he couldn't have been more attentive, friendly and compitent
(and good looking, too) In fact, Toast had a very handsome crew the night we visited
Our water other drinks were promptly refilled
Hats off to Toast for a very enjoyable evening after quite a hectic blackout
Toast is definately worth the visit
We'll be back!
The food is great and the prices are excellent
They have a large selection of beers and happy hour everyday makes them an even better value
The service is sometimes slow but always very friendly
The calamari is the best I've ever had
The place is trendy and the food is good
Service is variable but the food comes in large portions and is excellent
We didnt order or eat what we were forced to pay for, but its hard to point that out to the waiter when you only see them once every hour, so we just ate around the entre and pointed this out when he miraculously appeared to pick up our check
Twenty five bucks for two plates of fries and a wasted entre that we didnt want to eat will have you running to a corporate restaurant with corporate policy
To any of the employees or managers of Toast who might be reading this, take notice of how many reviews there are here that mention how bad your service is and pay attention to what they have to say
No less than six reviews out of ten (including mine, with no small amount of retribution) now mention your terrible service
This can't be an aberration
The food at Toast is inconsistent and has gone from good to mediocre
The service during my last two visits was terrible: the wait staff was aloof and slow
The Scene It's hard to miss the dramatic aquatic centerpiece in the David Rockwell-designed interior
A huge water wall, pieced together with thousands of azure blue tiles dotted with white plaster body forms in mid-swan dive, rises up from the foyer to the second floor
The Food If you order only one appetizer, make it the shrimp ceviche
It's a delicate combination of tender bay scallops, baby shrimp and calamari served in a martini glass, with a traditional citrus marinade that's made subtly sweet by mango and honeydew melon
That nuance of flavor continues throughout the menu--a cold avocado soup tastes of grapefruit and a sea bass special has undertones of sweetened orange
Anyone looking for a quick meal before rushing off to Lincoln Center would find this place a true find
The food is good (although not great), the atmosphere is fun and lively and the sevice quick
The prices are reasonable by New York standards, so this place is on my list of good quickies when I'm rushing to th theatre
We've had numerous lunches here
The way they mix the avacado right in your face is a treat
However, we did go for dinner here last night
Needless to say it was packed
The problem is the waiting area at the front of the restaurant
People are lined up in front of the door and on the staircase
It's tough to get up and down
No staff members ask you to stay in a certain area as people crowd the stairs to the upper level
I had to ask someone excuse me three times and of course he couldn't hear me from all the noise
I then tried to get passed him and he looked at me as though I was crazy
But what are the choices, a group of 4 people crowding a narrow staircase and not a staff member in sight to direct people where to go
Went their on Valentine's Day
which was not the greatest
But the ambience and atmosphere was very pleasant
For appetizer I had the duck, which was quite succulent
Fish was very good and the service was a plus
I have plans to go back and enjoy this beautiful restaurant
I found it very romantic (even though i was crying my eyes out)

Service is absolutely LOUSY during the lunch rush, from 12 - 2 pm
And it's extra hard to get a table if you are a party of 3! But, must admit, the salmon bento box deal is very good and tasty
I've also been to other locations and had a pleasant experience
The food is generally good and not too expensive for Manhattan
I went to East twice with my friends and we loved it
Cheap sushi rolls for Monday night and half price Japanese BBQ on Tuesday night
The food is pretty good for about $15 per person
This location of east has bad service and the sushi is very fishy tasting
The one at 50th and Broadway is much better
In Short During lunch, the long, brightly lit room comes alive, as conversation fills the room
The menu features lunch food spiced with an occasional international touch
The "market table" buffet (priced per pound) includes marinated asparagus, barbecue chicken and roasted-shallot mashed potatoes
Among soups and sandwiches, there's corn and pumpkin bisque and turkey with cranberry aioli
Finish up with homemade cookies and brownies or a smoothie
yes the food is a little more expensive than your average mid-town lunch deli's but it is worth it
1 lb from buffet is about $10
sandwiches are aboutt $9
The soup is a rip-off
The Buffet is awesome
selection changes daily and is super fresh
You can tell they cook qith quality ingredients
i used to eat here everyday until i switched jobs
Dishes is brightly lit with a modern decor - yes even the food bar - and it's very cheery inside
But the real reason to go there is the food bar
The food is fresh, fresh, fresh
You won't find old-school NYC practices like putting out 3-day old vegetables that smell like the subway or rancorous meat like at common delis
They have exotic concoctions for staples, my fav: coconut crusted chicken fingers (made w/real chicken)
They've nice desserts, salads, and sandwiches also
The only downside is cost
The food bar is $8
90/pound, $3 more/pound than most places, but well worth it
It gets a recommended rating for value despite the expense
Be wary of the lunch crowd: 12-2 it is a zoo
I highly recommend you try Dishes
The #1 lunch place without any close #2
Delicious incredibly fresh food
Blows any other midtown spot away
But pricey
Pricey
Everything's a couple of dollars more than other places
That adds up
I eat at Dishes once, some times twice daily and pass by Grand Central Market at least twice a week to take food home
I pray to god never to loose my job in midtown, so every day I can look forward to the food at Dishes
The previous reviewer obviously has a hidden agenda and does not have a clue
Everyone in my office eats in Dishes and they love it
The food here is decent for a midtown lunch (which isn't saying much) , but it's pricey for what they give you
The service here was the worst I've ever encountered
Forget the Grand Central Market, they won't pay you any mind there
As for the Grand Central Cafeteria, they get so busy, they don't even make eye contact, throw your food in a bag, snatch your money and hope you don't want anything else
The only reason why such a place is still in business in 3 locations within a 1/2 mile is because we're all too busy during the work day/week to find anything better
I'll never go to this establishment again
If you're in the area, or are in the mood to take a lunchtime walk, i'd highly recommend lunch at Dishes
The soups are to die for, and the salad area always has amazingly creative dishes that never dissappoint
The sandwiches are also great (although huge, so consider sharing), and are made even better by their grill press
Makes each sandwich taste even better when cooked that way
For lunctime it may be more than you'd want to spend, but after eating at several other places in the area, the prices are not all that different, and you can be assured that it will always be as tasty as can be
Yes, prices are a bit steep, but the food is fresh and of good quality
From soups (love the pumpkin corn bisque), to sandwiches (gilled cheese is my favorite), to the hot food that's mostly asian influenced, and salads that even include seared tuna, there's something for everyone
And if you have a few extra bucks grab a krispie treat that's as big a a brick on your way to the register
And if you are on a diet, the smoothies are a sweet second choice
Can't wait for their new spot to open in the Grand Central Market
this place's salad table puts everyone else's to shame
If you get lucky they'll have Moroccan chicken soup, which is awesome
It's a little expensive, but c'est la vie -- where *else* in Midtown are you going to get lunchtime fast food this good?
The dishes here are indeed quite good -- the soups, especially
Yes, the lines can be daunting and the prices a trifle steep (though not if you comparison-shop with nearby midtown eateries), but decent food, plenty of options and staff that keep the lines moving should do much to assuage your fears
A tip for the claustrophobic: offpeak is much, much, much emptier -- you might even get a table
If you are willing to cough up some big $$$ on Italian Food, go to Il Mulino
The food is much better and not as expensive
In terms of food, it is not bad- however, the food and wine are over priced
I didn't like the escargot, and I didn't enjoy the $45 lamb at all
Their homemade pasta was good, but it is also over priced($35)! Service was good, but they included 19% tips on our bill (party of 2), and waiter didn't tell the prices for specials when we ordered
I do not recommend this restaurant
The food was wonderful
I had shrimp in a whitesauce as appetizer that was to die for
It was followed by an angus steak that melted in my mouth/ Atmosphere and staff was perfect
I can't wait to return
What a wonderful restaurant! I had dinner with a large group and was delighted in how great everything was
The food was superb
The service unbelievably good and the decor/atmosphere was cozy
Il Postino has a genuine charm that extends to every member of their staff that makes you feel so good about being there
I would highly recommend this restaurant
A true delight!
Service and food always outstanding for my wife and I
We always include Il Postino on our trips to the city
We always recommend freinds to include Il Postino and all have had the same great praise
We enjoy that they will make anything we want and how we would like it prepared
We love the people,service,food and location
Service was great, very friendly, never rushed us, did not mind repeating the specials
Food was excellent
Diners used to ordering everything on the side might balk at the no menu, informal approach but the grilled white truffle risotto is amazing - tender and savory
The meats are exotic and delicate and the service supreme
I've used Il Postino almost exclusively to entertain international business colleagues with never a disappointment
The food was so-so, which ranks way above the service which was downright rude and it's so loud we couldn't hear each other
We were given the check BEFORE receiving our coffee
2 waiters and 2 busboys hovered over our table
I had to tell one busboy to stop taking things off our table
The coatchecker actually stood next to our table with our coats open for us to put on! I didn't even get to drink my cappuchino
We will never go back
Disappointing! The food was ok, but nothing special

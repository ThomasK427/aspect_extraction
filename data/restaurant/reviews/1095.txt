The staff was friendly and attentive
I read the other reviews and decided to check out the place
I agree the place gets busy real fast but I thought the staff was still attentive
The food was just amazing and I definitely will be back for more
I've eaten at many different restaurants in Queens and Kyoto is definitely one of my favorites
Their food is fantastic, quality is superb, and presentation and atmosphere looks very high end
Also, I never had a complaint about their service during the numberous times I've been there
You must give it a try and see for yourself
You will enjoy a great night plus it won't break your bank either
i've eaten here a couple of times because of the good food
but each time i've eaten here, the service has been horrible
the waitresses are slow even when there's very little people, and at times they are very rude
one time we gave them a tip that was very small because the service was horrible and the waitress asked us if that was the tip! now we just order take out so that we don't have to deal with the service, and be able to enjoy the good food
I just celebrated my 5 year anniversary with my girlfriend the other night at Kyoto which came highly recommended by my friends
It was definitely a great experience
The pleasant ambiance, food, service made the whole night perfect
My girlfriend loved the combination of Japanese Thai food mixed together
The presentation was excellent and prices were affordable
This sort of place would break my wallet if it were in Manhattan
It is definitely a Best of the Best in Queens
(Thank you Kelly for your Great Service ALSO!)
I have gone to this place several times hoping that the service will get better but it has failed us all 3 times
The food is good but for those of you that want a pleasant dining experience, don't think about coming here
We've had the wait staff ignore us or reject us from the tatami seating area even though the whole place was empty
They didn't check up on us and after giving a tip, the chinese waitress ran after us to complain about not tipping because she miscounted
What a disaster
Again, the food was good and if you are looking for good cheap Japanese takeout, this may be your spot, but who wants to dine at a place when the waitress hands you the check before you ask for it and says pay now please
The worst service ever in a restaurant
The waiters just ignored us
We asked for a coke atleast 5 times before they served us
The pineapple fried rice was burned
The sushi tasted unfresh
Save yourself the money and time
Pick another restaurant!
I went there for dinner on a Tuesday night and surprisingly there were many people eating there
Food was pretty good and the service was friendly
I thought its an interesting idea of Japanese and Thai fusion
The dancing spider roll was delicious
The only bad thing was that they only had 3 types of beers
=)
I've been living and eating in this neighborhood my whole life and I'm so glad there's finally a great restaurant here
I've been reading their service needs work, but I've been going to Kyoto since it first opened and the waitstaff and management are so friendly and personal compared with others
No chinese waiter torture here and they seem to be getting busier and busier which is a great sign
I also love the decor and atmosphere making it a good date restaurant
And if you don't like raw fish like me (my gf loves it) they have great Thai food
The spicyness is just right, not too mild and not too extreme
The Rocket Shrimp, Kyoto Salad, Sizzling Beef and Dancing Shrimp are my favorites
Lastly, if you want entertainment sit at the sushibar, otherwise definitely try out the Tatami booths if you want a little more privacy
I had the worst service ever at this restaurant! I'm talking about one of the waiters
Yeah, I could see that they were so busy at that time, but that doesn't mean they can give less or unsincere service
My wife and I ordered a beer and a hot tea, and he brought beer after a while, opened the bottle, and told us he'd be back with a glass
After 10 minutes or so, I had to ask him again for a glass and a hot tea, and he came back with only a glass
It took about 1/2 hour to get our food and A HOT TEA!!! He finally realized that I was so upset and poured soy sauce into a small plate for sushi and said sorry but it was way too late to say that
Of cource, tip was $0
00
i've been here several times already and i have got to say, Who knew? who knew that the food would be amazing in a random area in queens
i love the sashimi, so fresh and tasty
the plates are huge and servings are generous
one drawback is the pad thai, surprisingly not as good as others but other than that, the thai is great
you have GOT to try this place out
oh yes, the tempura ice cream, in my top 10 in the metro area
I came across this place looking through City Guides and was glad I found it because it's only 10 minutes away
The sushi was great but I haven't tried their Japanese and Thai entrees though
On the first visit we had the Passion Boat and it was pleasantly displayed and it filled us up and it was relatively inexpensive
The second time we ordered a-la-carte and it was just as satisfying
Try the Rocket Shrimp for an appetizer and the Flying Dragon Roll and the Scorpion King Roll and you won't be disappointed
The one gripe we had was the slow service
They were very pleasant but on too many occassions we were kept waiting and it wasn't very busy on both visits
I still recommend this place and we actually plan on inviting more people so we can go into one of their booths
The sushi was magnificent! I never thought you could get such good food for so little
You should order as many dishes as possible because everything is so good! I visited Kyoto this past weekend with a friend and we were amazed by the service and dcor of the place
We wanted EVERYTHING on the menu (including the specials) because it all sounded so good
Yes, the portions are big and inexpensive
The service, quality and taste far exceeded our expectations
The sashimi was heavenly - and literally melted on my palette! You will not have to spend a lot for great food and service
Go to Kyoto you would never expect sushi to be this great in Queens
Kyoto sushi, a very good choice of cuisine when it comes around to lunch time
Its not often that you find a place which has that spicy and delicious Thai food
I recommend the pineapple fried rice
I crave it just about everyday at work while flipping through lunch menus
They have many other selections in their Thai menu that are just as tasty
And unbelievably, its also fused with a Japanese menu
Great job Kyoto
Whoever came up with the idea of combining Japanese and Thai food in one restaurant is a genius!!!! They serve everything I love in this restaurant such as Deep Fried Oyster, Pad Thai, Sushi, TEMPURA ICE CREAM!!!!!!, just to name a few
The waitstaffs are very friendly and attentive
Even though the sushi bar is a bit slow, it's worth the wait! =)
I was really impressed with the presentation of the food
I felt like I went to a high end restaurant in the city when my food arrived at my table
Sashimi sushi were extremely fresh (highly recommend that Angry Lobster roll)
Appetizers were great (don't forget to try the rock shrimp spring roll thing, its awesome)
Service was very nice
Ambient is great
Overall, a hip place for great food and good times
Definitely a nice place to take your date to!
When I came back to NYC to visit, my sister and her fiance took me to this resturant where it consist of Japanese and Thai food which I love
The sushi was fresh and tasty
the tum yum goong was mad good and flavorful and not the mention the appetizer
All were very tasty and yummy
I ate soo much that I still wanted more
NExt time I visit NY I will for sure go visit Kyoto, not to mention the 2 HOT HOST!!

Check out the toys and play a vintage video game while you are at it
Definitely the best dog in the East Village
There are not a lot of joints in the city that are firndly to both the after-hours crowd, families, vegitarians and pets
I've been there many times and the food is always great and its always a good time
Crif Dogs has saved the tofu pup for New York veggies everywhere
They split them down the middle to grill them so you don't have the same old soggy dog you get in other places
The result is a hotdog as yummy as its meat counterpart
The other real reason to come here is to play old school video games
Definitely a great, cheap date
My only complaint are the fries, which are hard and crispy to the point of being flavorless
Whatever happened to peanut oil boardwalk fries? They belong here
I stumbled all over Manhattan last weekend looking for the wonderful delight known as the crif dog
Seriously it is one of the best hot dogs I have ever had! The selection is unique and very tasty
Even if haven't had a few, Crif Dog is a real treat! Did I mention you can play old school video games? Awesome!
Can't get enough of Crif Dog's Chihuahua (bacon wrapped hot dog topped with sour cream and avocado)
Had it with a side of tater tots and I was in heaven
The friendly staff and the old skool arcade games make it an inviting late night hang out
I cannot get enough of the Crif
I can't believe anyone would not like this place
Every time I have been, the workers are nice and fast, the decor is funny (old Ms
Pacman game and all) and the crispy-skinned dogs are the best I've had
It's an extrmemely satisfying and highly addictive experience
Fantastic dogs, even one for the vegetarians! Try the classic Crif Dog -- so good
Take a few to the park down the street on a sunny day
Go to Pomme Frites first on 2nd Avenue and grab some awesome fries to go with your dogs
Some buds of mine from Providence/Boston were here for the weekend, and scoffed when I mentioned Crif
They have Spike Dogs in their neck of the woods and it can't be beat
Well, after our stop around 2:30 AM (No Curfew here!) they all whole heartedly admited that Spikes is down right lame compared to Crif Dogs
I expected no less
One dude from LA said its better than Pink too
I don't even really like hotdogs and I still love this place
A great cheap fun place to stop latenight, before or after the bar and grab a bite
Crif Dogs has taken the lowly hot dog and turned it trendy
Sure, you can have the usual--chili dogs, mustard ketchup, sauerkraut, etc
But the real deal is the speciality dogs
Try the chihuahua (with bacon, sour cream and avacado)
The milkshakes are fantastic
And while you're at it, play a game of centipede for old time's sake
Gotta love Crif Dogs if not for the video games, but for the dogs
It's oopen late and is a perfect stop between your favorite East Village bars
Just don't go in expecting to use the bathroom - there is none
Never have I thrown away half a hot dog in my life--until Crif Dogs
My girlfriend and I went to this place and the dogs were cold
We asked the guy about them and he was rude
We threw them out and then went to Dawgs on the Park
A buddy told me that Crif was a rip off--shoulda listened
If you love hot dogs, you can't help yourself but to fall in love with Crif Dogs
It's a great location, cozy seating, plus you can play video games for only a quarter!! The dogs are great, they have LOADS of toppings and all sorts of special dogs
It's like a meal on a bun
The chihuahua is my fav: crif dog (deep fried) wrapped in bacon, with sour cream avocado
I tried it on a dare, and can't stop myself now! Plus the staff is super friendly
if this is what passes for a good hot dog in new york city i'm moving back home
i tried all of their dogs and these things are bland and try and make up for it with some weak deep-fry and lame toppings
go to gray's papaya for the same thing for a lot less or go to boston/providence and have a spike's dog and blow your mind
Vegetarians appreciate any nod their way--especially at a hip hot dog palace like this one
Maybe it's just beer goggles, but these dawgs seem larger than the ones at FB
See for yourself!
Don't want to make it a habit, but these dogs are hard to resist
Good veggie dog, and someday I'll work up the courage to get the one with bacon
Fries are good, too and they have videogames to play while you wait
The Scene Painted in glowing Miami hues, this restaurant begs for attention
Inside, two giant pink flamingos and a huge assortment of snapshots of canines watch you order
The friendly counter staff will help you navigate the menu, and with very little prompting, even recommend new favorite CDs
The Food Dawgs on Park uses the Best's kosher franks as the launching point for its specialty dogs, which range in messiness from manageable to fugeddaboutit, and come with french fries
The Sweet the Prairie Dawg's corn salsa is a refreshingly different way to dress a frank
The main problem with all the dogs--flimsy buns--reaches its apex in the chili dog: Be ready for a mess, as there is no way of actually picking up one of these things and getting it to your mouth intact
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson


until now
My life is complete
P
S
I believe the hot dogs they use are Newark-based Best's all beef frankfurters
Believe me, they live up to the name
Thanks again Dawgs!
When you want a quick bite in the city, and are afraid of those street vendors, this is the place to go! It's got the best hot dogs I've ever had
In fact, all the food is great - and there's more than just hot dogs
And the iced tea should be bottled and sold
Don't know what it is, but it's the best! It's clean, right on Thompkins park, and the staff are top notch -- they're so friendly -- they make you want to stay all day or come back ten times a day!
The most fantastic fried dogs I have ever had
I thought you could only get a good corn dog in the south, not true anymore
Now you can go to alphabet city for a great corn dog
Great assortment of fried hot dogs, corn dogs are delicious just like the south
The Scene The blocky red and black decor here begets a surprisingly homey air
Casual dates sip wine at dinnertime; brunches attract an equally mellow crowd
Service is personable and adequate, but courses can overlap or take a bit too long, and wine glasses are occasionally left parched
The Food The specialty here is comforting home-style cooking
Salads, especially the beets with blue cheese, walnuts and baby spinach, are a great bet and generous enough to share
Other starters, such as the grilled pizza and the cod cakes, can be hit or miss
The kitchen really excels with the comfort-foodish entrees: Braised short ribs fall off the bone onto creamy horseradish-spiked polenta, the roast chicken is addictive, and macaroni and cheese with kielbasa is just what you'd cook at home if you had the time
I went out with my friend last night to Deborah
We were so excited since I was reading great review of this place, however we were disappointed with the taste of the food
We ordered skirt stake and pork chop
It was very salty and saucy
The environment and the service was pretty nice but it wasnt all that to return again
I have to disagree with the two previous reviewers - I took two friends from overseas yesterday night and we had a thoroughly great experience (as always so far when I went to Deborah's)
Food was excellent (the lamb melted in my mouth), the service was very attentive and friendly
OK, the bill was delivered right when they served us the coffee but this is pretty normal here and they did not force us to pay right away and we chatted away for another 30 mins

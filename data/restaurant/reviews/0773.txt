the best way to experience ivo and lulu is with 4 people
the menu has 4 appetizers and 4 entrees
the evening we dined we rotated the different dishes and every dish we sampled was excellent
for appetizers try to finish with the mussels and with the entrees finish with the duck, both dishes are incredibly flavorful and spicy
the big bonus to this place is that it is byob
Just wanted to let you all know to beware of this host who answers the phone at this newcomer
I was very excited to eat here and invited another couple to join us - it is a bit out of the way - we arrived there to our supposed 'reservation' only to see that there were about 6 other couples waiting outside to be seated and that they 'don't take reservations'
I was positive I was given a reservation and this ruined our plans for the evening and we ended up leaving and walking around looking for a new restaurant for almost an hour
BEWARE!!
Went to Ivo and Lulu last night with a party of 6
The wait for a table was about an hour and a half, but VERY MUCH worth the wait
They allow you to bring your own wine and so we sat outside and had a glass or two while we waited
Once inside, there was a very homely feel with music mixed by the waiter playing
The menu is short and to the point, but cheap and all-enticing
We tried 8 of the 10 options of entrees and appetizers and were not diappointed by any of them
I had the chicken with goat cheese- my favorite thing I tried all night!! Would definately reccomend this place, but consider going with only a few people or go EARLY!!
A little out of the way, but definitely well worth the trip
Mark is an excellent host who makes you feel like you are the only ones in the restaurant
Not a huge menu, so if you are picky, may not be for you, but what is on that menu is fantastic food
Great vibe
Excellent
Also, it's BYO so that keeps costs down a ton
Marc and Blue are rocking it again
the food is wondrous, the ambiance is homely with a touch of funk, the service is lively
the real deal
Perfect place for anything and everything
treat yourself to the good life for a fraction of what you would expect to pay
Marc and Blue are terrific hosts
The food is great! The vibe even better
This is the perfect date place
Not too expensive and ultra hip!
The Scene The urban commotion of this downtown intersection's nightlife and retail scene doesn't stop at the door: Throbbing music and an energetic, happy crowd maintain a vibrant, semi-chaotic feel inside
Service is flirtatiously warm and affable, but sometimes harried
The Food The simple Italian menu covers a lot of ground, from Abruzzese boar ragu to delicately minty clams in broth
Cheesy bread crumbs, capers and lemon give a savory tang to the stuffed artichoke; cucumber batons and handsomely folded melon and cucumber refresh a familiar arugula-and-nut salad; and plain Greek-style grilled calamari, dressed with oregano and olive oil, are among the kitchen's best work
Brothy house-made fettuccine thrives amid juicy mushrooms and spinach, and there's a fine, fresh tomato sauce on gnocchi
The smoky grill excels with full-flavored whole orata and a juicy sliced-steak salad
The homemade tiramisu, stacked in a tall glass, is delicious
We had dinner for 6 at 8pm on a Thursday night
It wasn't too busy at that point, but was much more so later in the night
The food was really great
All of the dishes were uniquely flavored
As soon as we we sat down they brought bruchetta and gave us great service for the entire night
I would definitely go back!
My gfs and I had dinner here last nite and all of us enjoyed it
The staff is really warm and attentive and sat us by the window
The food is pretty good, esp the chocolate crepe! There is also a good variety of pasta and anti-pasta
Mashed potatoes were really good! Its also very afforable, btwn the 5 of us, we each had an entree, shared 3 appetizers, a bottle of wine, and the crepe and with tip it was $40 each
Place is very small tho so make sure u rsvp
Great place for a date or just a casual dinner with friends
Cute little spot for a date or small party
The complimentary brushettas were perfect - the bread wasn't too hard or soggy
Had the fried calamari which were okay - could have used a little salt
However, saw the grilled calamari and from the looks of it - it looked like a better appetizer
Would definately reccommend the buccatini and the capellini
I think our waiter was the owner
He was pleasant and efficient
In terms of service, the place was on point
this place is great
every time i go the staff is helpful and the food is FANTASTIC! Just wish it was a bit bigger!
My husband and I have gone several times
We like the place so much, we took our family there the night before our wedding
The restaurant did a flawless job handling our party of 18
Our table was well attended and the pacing was perfect
They were very helpful in setting up the evening by helping us decide on wines, showing us several of their dishes/specials and they consulted us on how we wanted the tables to be configured
I think the chef does a great job with sauces, especially for his specials
The fried calamari is some of the best we've ever experienced
Popped in for a late dinner at Basso Est and was pleasantly surprised
This narrow, brightly colored restaurant seats about 20 people and features a small bar and open kitchen at the end
An entree of vegetable ravioli was split as an appetizers, delicious with a sprinkle of nutmeg
My chicken with brown sauce and fontina cheese was decent
A complimentary bruschetta appetizer and apertif began and ended the meal
Service is great, especially from Roberto the manager
This cute and cozy spot would be great for a date
They are opening a second restaurant in the city
After stopping into a trendy restaurant on the LES where we couldn't get a table until 11:30pm my boyfriend and I decided to stop into Basso Est - and am I glad we did! We were first greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked if we had reservations - even though we didn't they were VERY accommodating - we sat at the bar and spoke to the VERY nice bartender who recommended a GREAT wine and gave us some brucetta to munch on while we waited
The food at dinner was out of this world - it was extremely fresh and flavorful
This was followed by the BEST chocolate crepes I've ever had! The staff was very friendly - the owner came over and gave us some grappa on the house, which was a nice touch to an amazing evening
There have been few restaurants that I've been to that have remotely come close to my experiences in Italy 3 years ago
This is one of them! When we walked in, we were greeted with a Buonaserra, immediately I felt at home
We did not have reservations so we sat at the small bar with the friendly bartender for 10 minutes
To make is simple, Service = Excellent Friendly staff, Food = Delicious, Wine List = Top Notch, and they had Limoncello (my favorite) and Grappa
Someone told me that they import all their cheese directly from Italy
doesn't get better than that!
I went to Basso Est for my birthday a few weeks ago
I had a reservation, and my (incomplete) party was seated promptly
While the rest of the party showed up we were given complimentary bruschetta
The whole experience was very delightful
The food was delicious and the service spectacular! I definitely recommend this place for a casual meal or special occassion
My family and I ventured to Basso Est after reading a review on line
We made a reservation for 6:30 on a summer Sunday evening and arrived after a long hot walk to find that we were the only patrons
We were a bit disappointed until we were greeted by the friendly owner
The owner and waiters rolled out the red carpet and treated us like long lost familia
Long story short--we spent 3 hours eating a marvelous meal, enjoying a great bottle of Sicilian wine and watching the world go by
By 8:00pm the 10 table restaurant was packed
Don't miss the artichoke appetizer--very different
And the various ragus were spectacular
A memorable meal
Now this is a place where people can learn about customer service! Really good food
Their veal sauce and gnochi is amazing

Entire experience is a display of tasteful balance: Atmosphere (upstairs) is casual yet refined, simple, yet not plain
Service is articulate without hauteur, well-honed, and generous, enthusiastic without lapsing into overfamiliarity
Particular commendations to waiter, Jorge, and Sommelier, Cullem
An evening to long-savor
Ringraziamenti, Babbo!
Hard to get reservations, but once you have them
absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and I sat upstairs where the tables are spaced out more than the more rustic downstairs
We are a young couple, and the service was outstanding, our waiter was so helpful and actually didn't push anything on us, even had some laughs with him
Sommelier was less helpful, he went from table to table without really making solid recommendations
Definately study the wine list or you will spend a good 1/2 hour looking at all the Italian wines
Had several courses including the goose liver ravioli (to die for! still thinking about it), the beef check ravioi (great), the spaghettini with lobster (delish) and the gnocchi with oxtails (superb)
The sorbetti at the end of the meal was fantastic
One of the best dining experiences I've had in New York
Most interesting food I have tasted lately
Study the menu before you go
If you don't have time to do that, the perfect waiter will take a lot of time in explaning
Marvelous food, hard to eat elsewhere
Chose to go here for my first wedding anniversary
first time diner
high expectations
Other than some great meals at Nobu, my evening here ranks as the most enjoyable dining experience I've ever had in NYC
Had the traditional tasting menu with accompanying wines
SO good
great variety of flavor and perfect wines to match each course
I asked for a nice table, and they said they could not accomodate my request
but I could tell they made an effort to seat us in the more romantic upstairs setting
Everyone from hostess to waiter wished us a happy anniversary
Service was just shockingly good
dined for about 3 hrs
there
nice, leisurely pace
Eat here and die happy!
If you're looking to dine on expensive food that is well worth the price and beyond, Babbo is for you
We have never had a problem getting a reservation, the staff has always been friendly and courteous - never snooty - and of course the food is beyond compare
We would highly recommend the traditional tasting menu
The time we waited to be seated was unacceptable
But what was really disappointed was the food
That is not how italian food tastes
I took out from my ragout as much parsley as a feast!! It killed all other flavours and it just doesn't tasted italian! The cured meat are a scam! who makes his own cured meat!They just do not taste good
The rest is just dull
There are so many good nice real italian food in NYC, just stay away from Batali's places (otto is pointless as well) and chek out the real authentic italian restaurants
Servers and wait staff were very attentive but snooty
Atmosphere was great, very intimate
Food was wonderful
I would encourage people dining here to dress up, men should definitely wear a suit jacket despite the lack of dress code
Any one who ever gave Babbo less than a 10 should stay home because they do not know fine dining
The attention to detail, the professional and friendly staff will make anyone feel welcome
I will say the only part I found difficult was making the reservations! Anyone who has tried to do that will understand - But do not let that stand in your way of enjoying your experience at Babbo! A perfect 10 all the way
Babbo was very disappointing
We were really looking forward to going - one of those places where you have high expectations and it did not deliver
Nice ambiance, good service, good food, but something was lacking
Not sure what it was, but we won't be going back for a long time
Had the pasta tasting menu with wines
Food is absolutely delicious, many wonderful and varied flavors
Service was top notch
Our waiter had fun explaining the different courses and wines to us
Was lucky enough to sit in the upper level dining room which isn't as crowded as the lower level
Expensive, but you know it will be
The food is heavenly, but it is impossible to make reservations
We save this for very special occasions
I have eaten at a lot of restaurants and Babbo is definitely a musts for those seeking great food in Manhattan
The service and food was impeccable and the dining room a little crowded for my taste
I've never been into overhearing another parties conversation while I dine
Great place for a date or romantic evening
I was surprised by the decently sized portions
The quality is deservedly legendary and don't believe anybody who tries to tell you differently
The service was fine
We put the wine selection in their hands and they suggested three marvelous, modestly priced wines to go with our antipasti, primi and secondi
Go with the small (1/3 bottle) portions
Plus, water always filled, bread always there, crumbs always gone, new silverware immediately after every dish, advice when you ask for it and they are absent when you need that too
The guy at the front desk when you check in is not the friendliest fellow in the city, but I got a kick out of him
He seemed so east coast
I lost a bet so my wife and I went to Babbo
We waited a month for a reservation
We are a young couple living in NYC
We were dressed very appropriately yet we were placed in the table deepest in the corner
Our waiter came by and treated us like we did not belong there
We also had some questions about wine, so we had to wait for the sommelier
He showed up after our first course was already served
The Appetizers and the Deserts were very tasty
Overall the entree was good, but did not have the Oooh-Aaah that I was looking for
In a middle range restaurant I probably would not care, but considering the rave reviews of this place I was definitely disappointed
Overall a good restaurant, but not for the price
Will go out of my way to tell friends NOT to go to Babbo
While the food was good, it certainly wasn't good enough to make up for the appallingly poor service
We were actually shooed away by the bartender when we asked why he ignored our drink request and what is with the weird commentary from the wait staff after they deliver each food course to the table oh your pasta looks amazing - Enjoy! You've got to be kidding me? What happened to humility and good taste? There are just too many restaurants in NYC where both the food AND THE SERVICE are excellent and worth the big price tag
NEVER EVER AGAIN
Ironically we were warned by friends NOT to go because of the haughty service
I'm just sorry we didn't heed their advice
I've eaten at Babbo a few times and it is consistently great
The portions are sufficient for their RICH flavor
VERY satisfying
The seafood and pasta dishes are amazing
The grilled octopus is PERFECT
The pumpkin ravioli is great
And if you can make it to desert it's definitely worth the calories
I had to walk 20 blocks home after my last meal here because I forced myself to eat dessert -- I was so full
Great date place or special occasion
Romantic cozy atmosphere
Totally wonderful experience

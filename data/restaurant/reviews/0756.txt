The regular coffee was dreadful
And I understand that restaurants need to charge $2
50 for a coke, but another $2
50 for a refill is nearly a crime
We all also agreed that the decor is way too themed, it feels so fake, like you're in Disneyland or something; the space could definitely use some streamlinening
I walked into this place late on a Friday night
They looked like they were about to close
A rude Frenchman (why I'd never!) did not discharge his duties properly, making no attempts to accomodate us and grudgingly checking if the kitchen was still open
The wine selection was okay, but subpar for a French bistro
I had the tuna steak, which was nice but nothing to write home about
I would probably not eat here again
I've been here couple of times and I just tried their fois gras
all I can say is - it was amazing
I also found the wait staff very friendly
Very down to earth
And their duck is great as well
Go on a Sunday - it's much more quiet
Don't really understand all the reviewers whining about service--I've been to Moutarde a number of times and have never found it anything but charming
I guess they're more friendly and welcoming than obseqious and proper, so if you want to be fawned over by uptight drones go elsewhere, but if you're looking for a comfortable, down-to-earth, neighborhood bistro, Moutarde is a great choice
I've tried Moutarde several times and it has gotten worse each time
Last night was my last time
We waited over an hour and 10 minutes for our entrees
No explanations or apologies, actually no one stopped by our table at all in this time
We had empty beer and wine glasses in front of us
They always forget your order here
I waited over 35 minutes for a salad and only got it after chasing the waiter down to ask him about it
The manager obviously does not care, he wanders around looking spaced out
I told him there was a problem and he said okay and walked away
Being a snotty french guy, does not a manager make! Please get new management here, and I would come again
The service is the worst I've ever had!
After moving to the neighborhood, my girlfriend and I decided to try out Moutarde
After not opening the doors on time and seating ourselves after the doors were opened we started with dinner
Our server was snotty when asked questions
When asked what wines were served by the glass, she simply told us the varietals and not the producers
Apps took 35 minutes
Entrees were mediocre and she never came back to check on us
We were the second table in! We watched the staffs take shots at the bars while we choked for water!
Moutarde was I said was, when they open the staff was great specially 2 brothers working there
Since mid may all changed :new staff we do not come back quite often now
The food is good but the ambiance is not the same
Can someone tell us what happend with the 2 brothers, they where fun, pros and made our days each time we where going there
I was worried about visiting Moutarde because it looked so trendy and I don't like what's happening to my street (witness monstrosities like Bibi and La Villa down the block) but I gave it a shot a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised
My salmon was fantastic, as was the skate and the warm chocolate cake
My only complaint was that when I tried to go back with some friends on a crowded night, the place was packed, yet they told us there was a 20 minute wait and that we should wait at the bar
Needless to say, it was not a 20 minute wait
Why not have a reservations policy, or at least be honest like Al Di La is (if it's 2 hours, they tell you)
Being a mustard lover I was anxiously awaiting the food creations of a place calling themselves Moutarde
After being seated by a waiter that was either high on the mustard fumes or something else, we were served a platter of sample mustards to go with our bread
The idea itself was great, but they should have had more exotic samples of mustard, as why chew on plain Dijon when you can get this anywhere? The appetizers were tasty and the snail ravioli quite adventurous, however the main courses were quite bland and even though the steak was featured with mustard sauce it really was just plain stone ground mustard
Even though they do not serve the traditional dish of sardines, you can certainly rely on the fact that they will cramp you in like one
The next best thing in the slope
One of the best menus and quality food on the street and less expensive than Blue Ribbon neighbor
Ask about vegetarian special of the day - I received an amazing mushroom wellington - wild mushrooms in a puffpastry wrapper on a bed of spinach
Great parisian french bistro feeling
Good for friends, family, dates, and a cafe au lait by yourself in the rain
Indeed the worst restaurant on 5th Ave restaurant row
Our waiter seemed not to know what he was doing, we only saw him once during the 2 hours that we were seated
We had empty glasses on our table since the first course, no bread service, and to top that all we waited over 40 minutes for our entree!!!  Food took very long, and when it finally arrived it seemed the food has been sitting under the heat lamp for 10 minutes, the sauce was crusted onto the plate
Portions were small, and execution of the menu was horrible
I took my girlfriend here a few weeks ago eager to try a new French bistro in Park Slope
Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience
Immediately upon entering the restaurant, a wine cork flew across the doorway and almost hit me in the eye
I was shocked- the bartender thought it was cool to launch corks into a container next to the doorway
He didn't apologize
We sat down at the bar and ordered some appetizers
About 25 minutes later, we inquired whether they were ready, and was told they had forgotten our order! Instead of offering us a complimentary glass of wine, the bartender ignored us without apology
Finally upon receiving the bill, I was told that the owner had taken the appetizers off
It was too little, too late
I won't be returning!
the food was good not great (and certainly not worth a trek from the city
) and the price was reasonable
but the service was horrendous
After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted
He seem more interested in prancing around the restaurant gossiping with fellow servers
He ignored our attempts to be subtle
there were 4 of us and he never came back to check on our meals, to offer more water, wine, bread, etc
I've never in my life left a restaurant without tipping a waiter, but i was sorely tempted
in the end, we left 10%
it's great to see 5th Avenue expanding but there's no reason to make the trip back to my original neighborhood if this is the standard-bearer
The north slope sorely needed a neighborhood bistro and Moutarde perfectly fits the bill
Figuring the crowds can't all be wrong, I went last night and it was wonderful
The mussels w/ chorizo in a parmesan basket appretizer was delicious
The mussels were big and meaty, and the flavor of the chorizo blended perfected with mussels
My sirloin faconable moutard was perfectly medium rare, and the mustard red wine sauce tasted terrific
My girlfriends striped bass was wonderful and I don't even LIKE bass
The potatoes and french fries were both great, and she raved about the spinach
Chocolate cake for dessert was very moist and the french vanilla ice cream tasted home made
The waitstaff was very helpful and attentive, filling water glasses and replacing bread when needed, and the mix-up in the bottle of wine was quickly cured without comment
Overall, a fantastic dining experience
Highly recommended
My husband and I are real restaurant foody buffs and went excitedly to brunch at Moutardeon Sunday
We were greeted by a friendly host (may be the owner) and seated promptly (although it quickly packed)
Our eggs benedict was nothing out of the ordinary - the hollandais sauce was way too buttery and very bland, the salad was a bit on the wet side, home fries on the soft side, coffee was disappointing for a French bistro and we ordered the yogurt with fruit - plain yogurt with barely any fruit with it
Ofcourse the restaurant is new and perhaps they have some kinks to work out, but it for the same price you can get a higher caliber brunch at Banania or Cafe Luluc on Smith St
this is one of the best on 5th ave
bartender, hostess, and waitstaff were all affable and helpful
generally cool and comfortable decor, if a little bed breakfast-y
the food was well-excecuted, familiar bistro fare -- perfectly cooked sirloin steak, killer fries, excellent mussels and a great duck confit spinach salad
lotsa wine choices, most of 'em inexpensive
great time was had by all at less than $50 a person

This type of attitude filtered into the rest of the evening
The staff were rude and rushed us through our meal, clearing plates and laying down dessert menus while others were still eating their main courses
The menu was boring and the food was mediocre at best
The music was so loud you could barely hear the person speaking next to you
Not what I call a great birthday dinner for my friends
GO TO MAC DONALD INSTEAD THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE WILL BE ABLE AND YOU WILL HAVE A SMILE FROM THEM
Went to Park this past saturday nite on the reccomendation of a friend, for the bar scene, not the restaurant
This place is HUGE (and packed)! Walking in I was a little intimidated, but there's definitely a really cool vibe
I would say this is more a place for large groups of people, but don't count it out if it's just you and a few friends
No cover, which is awesome, and decently priced drinks
The decor is sweet, with fireplaces, lots of outside space (heaters for the winter too), more than a few bars, and tables/sofas if you want to sit
Parking down there could be a bit of a problem, but you shouldn't be drinking and driving anyway
Did not eat at The Park, but went there for a bday party last weekend
A lot of space and a cool setting
The outdoor patio upstairs is a plus
But the crowd was pretty average and the music was a bit played out
A good place if you're with a big group, but otherwise, there are a lot of better places if you're looking to chase tail on a saturday nite
The Park is not just a culinary nightmare, the service and staff is completely uncaring, obnoxious, and couldn't care less if you were there or not
In fact, during my first and last dining experience (or should I say travesty), I overheard a member of the staff tell a paying customer, If you don't like the service, or the way you're being treated here, then leave! This is an absolutely true account
I couldn't agree more with the many negative thing I've read about The Park
Not just on City Search, but a number of other web sites deictaed to providing the public with good food and good service
Free advice, stay out of the Park!
Not sure which is worse the service or the food, so I'm going to have they both suck
Take your business elsewhere and thank god you did
It's overcrowded and people do incidentally slam into you
Don't complain or you'll be asked to leave and to take your party elsewhrere
My last experience was a nightmare and and hope I can spare another person a disaster at the Park
When you go to the park you can expect long lines at the door regardless of how many people are inside, and intentionally understaffed bars to make it seem like a hip elite scene
However, you will not find a hip crowd, The reality of the matter is that nobody with any real class would ever go to this bar
What you will find is a bunch of MTV-raised recent college grads trying to make their first impression on New York City by foolishly paying outrageous prices for bottle service and VIP treatment
I'm surprised no one's mentioned the Sunday night scene at The Park (drinking, that is, not eating)
It's their gay night, and it's similar to Beige at B-Bar, which makes sense since the restaurant/clubs share the same owner
Very, very attractive and lively crowd (it's not at all BT), and they have free vodka drinks from 10-11pm
I haven't ever eaten at the restaurant, but Sunday nights are one of the best weekend party scenes in the city (unless you're a homophobe)
Take your next dieting date to this place
The food tastes like it was prepared by culinary students at a community college
But the drinks, decor and warm fireplace will give you and your calorie counting date more to do than eat their 'tasteless' and 'overpriced' food! Service has much to be desired too!
This place is always packed on the weekends with attractive young party goers
The outdoor patio is a great place to hang out when it's warm
The upstairs is great to with a roof deck and hot tub
However, there's always a long line to get up there, and once you've waited in the line, there is hardly anyone up there
GUYS: dress up
they won't allow you inside if you are wearing sneakers
The service is okay for a place that s so crowded, but you have to buy a bottle to get a regular waitress
Good times here
Great for the 20 something crowd
I had my doubts about this place because the website only has pictures of the space and barely mentions the food and doesn't provide a menu preview
In the end only had lunch here with a friend but the tuna burger was terrible
It was rumored on the menu to a wasabi burger but I've never had tastless wasabi so I'm not sure what the green mush slopped on top of the tuna filet was
The sweet potato chips that came with it were limp and pretty lifeless as well
I can't image that I will go back even for the garden
The Park had its 15 minutes of fame a while back, it was cool to be seen there and no one cared about the food
Now it is no longer a fashionable place, but a tourist/bt trap with poor service and bad food
If you enjoy raw egg huevos rancheros at brunch, or mushy overcooked duck, dried out beef, carelessly shucked and uninspected oysters and all for a nice hefty sum, then The Park is for you
Otherwise, yuck
But if you are in the neighborhood and you just want a drink or two, the space is very pretty, especially in the warm months and you can smoke in the garden
This restaurant has the worst service in the city
Go here if you want to spend a lot of money, eat ordinary food, and experience horrific service
During the summer, The Park is a great venue because of its outdoor space
The venue itself is very spacious with plenty of restaurant seating both inside and outside and several bars to choose from when the place is packed on those hot summer nights
The garden outside is somewhat of an escape from the city, but incorporates the general NY vibe
The Park also has an upstairs area where private/promoted parties are frequently held
Drinks prices are average and the scene is very mixed
The line can get quite hectic at times, so as a rule, earlier is always easier!
This place was recommended by a friend of mine, and I don't think I'll ever respect their opinion of a restaurant again! The atmosphere was preety origional (i
e
cool bar/big tree in the middle of restaurant) but that's about it
The food was sub-par, our waiter was absolutely awful, dessert was crummy-overall a bad experience
I was there on a date with another couple, and spent half the time trying to flag down our waiter who was talking to other waiters by the kitchen the whole time! Wasn't that expensive, but this is a big city full of great restaurants, and this is definetly NOT one of them!
Unless you have friends that are cool enough to work at PARK, don't expect any sort of normal service
The staff tend to think they are doing you a FAVOR by waiting/serving you
Although the crowd is cool and trendy, I would never willingly give this place any of my money or my attention! It is almost embarrassing the way these people think they are making it and oh so cool just b/c they work at this overhyped bar
it's a shame
Attitude isn't a problem - unless it comes from a grimy dive bar doorman with a chip on his shoulder
On our most recent trip, our group (who has no problem getting in ANYWHERE in the city) was heckled by a doorman who looked like one of hells angels
On previous visits, we enjoyed the ambience of the place - although the food was less than mediocre
While the food is not outstanding (it's good, just not knock-your-socks-off great), I keep coming back for the atmosphere and people watching
Great place to hang out with friends or someone special
Beware that the steak salad with crispy artichoke is basically steak and straw
Oysters are good, chicken is good, steak is good
Great place to eat and leave
However, if you are looking for a fun time at the bar you won't find it here
Leave and go elsewhere
Too boring
Went for New Years Eve, had a horrible time
Too packed and was charged too much money for the crappy drinks I had there
(But it was New Years, so its expected)
Went back two weeks ago, still had a horrible time
Pretty place, not worth the time
i would return here with friends for the atmosphere but the food was not great
i was there on a friday night when the place was very crowded
i went last night and the place was pretty weak
the decor was pretty nice, however, that does not make up for the fact that there was way too much bt
any self-respecting manhattanite should avoid this place like the plague
Recently went there and the food was excellent, as was the service
The hostess was snooty since we did not have a reservation but the rest of the dining experience amply made up for it
Yes, the crowd is not ultra-hip but so what? What I thought was very nice was that they welcome wheelchair-bound people of which there were several, all incidentally clad in black
I wouldn't go here for the scene anymore
Though it is still nice, they have been less particular about the crowd
Last time I went (Last month) it was so packed that it took me a good 15 min to get to the bathroom! However, I will still come here for the food- it's excellent

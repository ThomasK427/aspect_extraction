I wouldn't kill myself to go back though admittedly some of the food was quite good
This was a lovely place for more after-dinner drinking
Food rating given my us reflects the wines we had; we'll have to come back to eat and rate the food another time
First of all, bravo for having lambrusco on the wine list (so few places carry it, probably because it is an inexpensive wine!)
The bottles we ordered were very good and we'll be back to try the one they didn't have in stock (and to eatdrink)
The space is modern-y and the large windows out onto the street are perfect on a balmy night
The staff was rather friendlygracious, doing their best to accomodate our large walk-in group
Enjoyable
I cannot get enough of this place
The wine list is very reasonable great deals
The style of food can be eaten at 11:30am, 8:00pm or 3:30am
And they're open at those hours, so you may dine whenever you want
I loved Ino, but this is closer to the 'hood
I hear sidewalk cafe maybe coming soon
Don't beleive the hype, there is zero ambience in this dark drab crowded restaurant, with people who are waiting for a table standing over you as you try to eat
The service was terrible we waited an hour and it took 2 hours for the food to come
They brought out the first course which consisted of a plate of cheese that a mouse would starve if given to eat
I couldn't beleive it took an hour for that! Then the menu is all in Italian well I don't speak Italian so it took forever for the waitress to translate
The food was average at best and the portions were so small that it was insulting
I would definitely not go back
By the way if you are looking for a good wine bar try punch judys on Clinton, it's 100 times better then this place!
living around the corner, i just stopped in with a friend only a couple days after its opening
Sat down a got a decently priced bottle of wine
Very nice staff, a very comfortable and warm atmosphere
I would definitely come back and try some food
Although, the menu is a little limited and hard to translate, your server is more then willing to help you out with suggestions
the plates are mostly the small, snacky type
A perfect place for catching up with a long time friend (thats what i did)
The Scene A warm pink sign beckons patrons into a bar that conspicuously stands out from its colorless Queens surroundings
Looking like something straight out of the Upper West Side, Opus may at first seem like an odd fit for Astoria, but it's just part of the area's steadily expanding buzz
Soft gray booths sprinkled throughout the pub offer the clientele a cozy place to bond with the buds they came with, and a comfortable environment to get to know their neighbors
The Draw A late-20s crowd partakes of the full menu of salads, cheese platters and foccacia sandwiches (all served with plantain chips), as they chair-dance to the favorites of today and yesterday
The bar's waitresses seem to have a sixth sense for when customers have reached the bottom of a drink or are scratching their forks against empty plates
Folks feel catered to at this surprisingly spacious locale
This place is amazing!!! For those people who think you can't find a great bar outside of Manhattan take note
The staff is amazing
Everyone seems to really like what they do and it shows
I have sampled a few of the food items and have always been delighted in the quality
The bar looks great and the music sounds great
Keep it up!! I just cant get enought!!!!
Not only was the meal delicious for both my girlfriend and I
The presentation was good, the service was excellent, attentive, and respectful of our boundaries
We had cured meats, cheese, and fruit with olive bread; as well as breaded goat cheese with jalapeno cuts mixed in
The ambience was very manhattan, and we will both surely return
We even had one drink each and our tab with 20% tip was still reasonable
Went on a Friday night
The ambience is nice laid back lounge type with candles, banquettes, and a decent DJ
The food is uninspired, at best
It was like they shopped at Key Food and put everything in a microwave and overcharged for it
Bottom line: probably good for drinks (sangria was good), but don't go expecting a good meal
The place, yeah, is very nice but you can do without the exorbitant prices
Give me a break guys, this is Astoria, Queens! Not the Upper West/East Side! Plus, no matter how much you drink, you never get any buy-backs or anything for that matter
Be prepared for cardiac arrest when you get the bill
I've been to Opus a number times now and everytime I'm impressed by the generous portions of absolutely delicious food, the extensive list of unique drinks, and the friendly service
I recently went on a Monday night and was completely transfixed by the salsa band - they were amazing, as were the few people showing off their dance moves
Plus, it's never too crowded
Hang out in the back in your own table/booth, or sit up front and mingle - it's perfect no matter what your mood
What an amazing place
I stumbled upon this unique restaurant/lounge and glad I did
It's so rare to have a sleek-looking business with fantastic food, excellent service and slamming music, all under one roof, in the heart of downtown Queens
I hope word spreads quickly about this place, cause it rocks!
Why is this place always empty?  It's clearly the best place for after-work drinks for the burgeoning crowd of twenty-somethings living out on the N-R-W in Astoria, especially with Opus's new happy hours
On certain nights, they even provide complimentary champagne with dinner
It's also one of the few places in this neighborhood where they won't look at you strangely if you can't order in Greek
Prices are reasonable, service is attentive, food is great, the drinks are fantastic
the one thing it doesn't have going for it is a steady clientele
So if it will help my favorite neighborhood lounge stay open, I say Go! Go! Go! And tip well
Even though I lived in Astoria for 4 years, I had to go to the city to have fun, but OPUS has it all and only 2 blocks away
Friendly bartenders, the owner is one of the crowd, on the TOP of that the DJ is outstanding, from his high booth he reads the people mind
The music makes you stay till they close, even if you are alone you still feel that the DJ is dedicating the music only for you
IT IS A MUST GO ,,, and Girls feel free to have your ladies night there
LAST SATURDAY WE WENT OUT WITH -FRIENDS FOR A DRINK BEFORE WE WENT DANCING
BUT AFTER A FEW OF THOSE CASUAL COSMOS WE STARTED TO DANCE RIGHT THERE
Walking into Opus is like coming home after a long day at work and discovering a beautiful stranger sitting in your bedroom waiting to satisfy your every desire
Okay, I dont know quite what thats like
What I do know is that Opus is a very beautiful lounge
Comfy, warm and fuzzy with a stylish hip edge is how Id describe the vibe
Theyve got an extremely friendly/attentive staff that makes you feel like youre the most important thing since the discovery of the wheel
Great music/DJs
Martini cognoscenti will find the martini menu irresistible
Me? I find the bartenders irresistible
Theyre absolutely gorgeous---and they know how to mix a drink and make you feel at home
Although it looks like the kind of place that would commit assault and battery on your wallet, it isnt
The prices are very reasonable
Highly recommend it
And Im a raging alcoholic!
Found a flyer that said Unsatiable Saturdays, so I went to see what it was all about! Beautifull people, and a dj that was making me just want to stay and drink more! The bar was beautifull, the bartender could read my mind so my glass was full before it was empty! Only when you walk out you realize that you are still in Queens
Of the Astoria Bars, its one that finally does not cater just to the Greeks
Its a little city spot in a close but not far location
I'll be back!
if you feel lost in the hidden booths, then just sit on the bar, and chat with the bartender while she is making one of the 20 or so specialty martinis
Seems like a flavor heaven when you taste their unbelievable taneri-tini or their cinammoni rice pudding
If you need a kick after work, just take the espresso martini, or they can even make a mango mojito which is out of this world! Oh yeah, and the food
even if you are not hungry, try the chip platter
Queens has found its nitch!
From a bad bar and remade into the classiest lounge in Queens
From the decor to the vast array liquors and beers, to the dj's who spin the absolute best lounge music perfect for the scene inside NYC's newest and classiest lounge
The Scene Neighbors have warmly embraced this big-city version of a small-town cafe, with its tile floor, closely spaced tables and low-key air--it's packed nightly
Easy laughter and boisterous conversation spill through the open front doors, where small groups wait for their turn
The Food The restaurant does fine business dishing out down-home plates of Niman Ranch organic hot dogs and charred corn with finger-licking cumin-lime-cotija cheese smothered on top, but the expertly grilled salmon on mixed greens, tossed with a perky mint-lemon-dill dressing, is surprisingly excellent

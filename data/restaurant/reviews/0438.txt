Masked from it's outside decor, the small dining room puts you up close to your hosts
While each time you look up, your staring at the craftsman who is responsible for what you have ordered
The small menu is close to ideal in variety and quality, and the tastes are simple and crisp
The service was noninvasive, but very out of reach, and the wine list was nice but lacked variety in whites
Perfect for an intimate setting with guests and friends, just don't bring too many! I can't wait to return
This was one of my favorites from a few years ago
A magazine ran an article on the new chef saying that he was great
Quite the opposite
The menu is small (5-6 entre choices) which is fine, but 3 of them were unenviable! We were left to choose between boring salmon and chicken entres or a duck substitution
We picked the duck and what came out of the kitchen was embarrassing
A single overcooked and way over-salted duck leg confit on shredded cabbage for $17! They also substituted cheaper duck liver mouse for a foie gras appetizer with without telling us
Skip this place and go to AKA Caf for better and cheaper eats!!
The menu was very interesting and the food was great
The new chef Anthony Rose is just great and shines at this place
Staff was very nice too!
Alias is warm and cozy and you don't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton
Our waiter was helpful and charming, the food was perfect, and the wine was good, too
Highly recommended
Fantastic food and great service! A wonderfully unassuming boite
The hanger steak with blue cheese crumbles is delicious - definitely indulgent
The menu, while small, provides good variety
Careful attention has clearly gone into the concise wine list
We enjoyed a 1999 Laurona Grenache-Carignan blend that was surprisingly superb
And of all of these items at very VERY reasonable prices
I will definitely be visiting again (hopefully, soon)!
Great dinner for 4, each person loved the appetizers, entrees dessert
Food is one of the best values for the money in NYC simply yummy! Juicy steak, scrumptious fruit creme dessert ingredients
Very funky, trendy clientele
You Can't Tell A Book By Its Cover  Don't let the look fool you
This is one of New York's treasures
The plain and simple corner Bodega look befits the look of the neighborhood and the food is as complex and rich as the history and the present gentrification of the very same neighborhood
Some of the best food we have had in New York at VERY reasonable prices
Everything we ate from apps to desert left us all looking at each other and saying WOW, I am impressed
We indulge in New York's finest a great deal and this will become a stand by for sure
The menu is small but varied and everything on it is perfect! The wine list goes along with the rest of the menu, short, well selected and reasonable
Go as you are and I promise you will return often!
Alias was outstanding! Our waitress was totally friendly, helpful and informed
Food was fantastic
Wine list simple yet offers quality and value
I love 71 Clinton as well, but it is great to have such an up and comer across the street
i really enjoy this restaurant
i often eat out alone since my work schedule is hectic and my fiancee travels alot - i love going here and just enjoying great food, and great service in a nice low key environment
last time i was there the hostess kept filling my wine glass - and of course that's always appreciated when you're only charged for 1 glass!
i had picked this place for a friend's belated bday dinner
(FYI- i normally don't go to LES) I was VERY close to getting a heart attack by its outter appearance
(in my mind, i have to find a better place! I knew i should've stuck to my usual picks!) Then i calmed down as a friend pulled me inside
tables were a bit crammed, but overall i had a lotta fun with foods
there were 5 girls AND could;ve order all items on the menu :P i would go back if i ever traveled down there
Four thumbs up
We and another fairly demanding couple went on a summer Friday with high expectations, given the pedigree of the kitchen staff
We were not disappointed
The appetizers, including the pickles, were amazingly prepared, with thought given to flavor, preparation, amount, and presentation
They succeeded on all levels
The main courses were even better, if possible
Shrimp served lobster style, trout, and chicken fried portobello mushroom were all incredibly inventive, perfectly sized and just simply amazing
We enjoy taking gambles in restaurants, and the pickles payed off, as did the bay leaf custard dessert, which had no bay leaf, but had the essence, which amazed us
Ambiance and service were casually elegant downtown style, precisely fitting the clientele and neighborhood
After enjoying Clinton Fresh Food so much, I decided to try Alias
The cocktails for $6 were pretty good (the red sangria and a champagne/blood orange cocktail)
The best part of the meal was the appetizer: a skate fish cake dish that was delicious
The steak was okay, but nothing great, with skewers of cherry tomato and onion
The salmon was okay as well
For dessert, a chocolate bomb was pretty disappointing! I think Clinton is MUCH better, but Alias is worth trying
It has a large selection of sea food
I love 71 Clinton Fresh Food
so when I found out they were on vacation, I decided to try out one of the other fab restaurants on Clinton
Let me say first off
the food at Alias is very good and the decor is sleek cool
Why 3 Stars? - the service
We had to wait (longer than normal)for pretty much everything (water,bread,orders taken,wine,courses, dishes cleared, etc
) We had to, most of the time there, wave down someone when needed
I ordered two higher priced bottles of wine and pretty much poured it myself
No one asked us how any of our courses were
Maybe it was an off night (I also ran into friends of mine on the way out they were having the same problem with service) but it just wasn't a well-rounded evening
I will be back to try them again -my food was very good
I wasn't a fan of relative 71 clinton, so i was prepared to be disappointed
It was great though
Had a late dinner at the tiny bar - service was warm and unobtrusive
The pickle plate was a nice adventure
Pork shoulder was tender and flavorful, if not a bit heavy
I would definitely come back again
This place was great, the menu was smaller than most, but everything we ordered was delicious and original
The food took a little while to come, but it was well worth the wait and we were fine sipping the fabulous sangria and chatting
Highly reccomend for anyone looking for interesting dishes with wonderful flavor
my husband and I decided to try alias when we read about it in new york magazine
we've been to 71 clinton and had an amazing meal, but actually liked this one better AND it was less expensive
the wine list is small but really well chosen
the menu is inventive, delivering cohesive well executed plates and the service was friendly and attentive
we've eaten at more than our share of 5 star resturants and alias can more than hold it's own
we'll be going again and often
I recently had my 22nd birthday dinner at Negril with a group of my close friends
I had so much fun! I loved the ambience
All of my girls were happy with the drinks and loved all the food
If you are planning on having a group dinner, make a reservation and make sure everyone is on time! The Negril staff is picky about starting reservations on time! so my best advice is to get everyone there much earlier than your reservation
If people are late, you could lose your reservation and/or the staff does pressure you to start ordering even if your whole party hasnt arrived
I loved the restaurant and I'd love to go back again!!!!!
Whenever I just stroll down to the village, I always end up at Negril
I introduce new friends to the hot spot and they get hooked with their macaroni and cheese and shrimp roti
Great spot for a date or even hang out with friend
The price is reasonable

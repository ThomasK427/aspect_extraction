Because of the reviews here I was really excited about shepherd's pie
but it was not on the menu
where is it?? So, I had the gnudi appetizer - very yummy, and a burger - it was a very good burger but nothing really special
There were 3 of us and they sat us at a table made for 2 people so it was a little crowded, and the backless stools weren't the best
No wait for a table though (it WAS a Tuesday night around 7)!
I go to the Spotted Pig once in a while
Love it
Pros: Cozy ambience, Great location, Tasty food (especially hamburger and shepherd's pie - yum, yum!), Reasonable prices
Con: Tough to get a seat, especially if more than 2 people
But if you're in the mood for a long wait - bring a book or a friend - definitely worthwhile
Especially on a cold or rainy day
During my latest brunch at the Pig, the service was consistently indifferent and cold, which is more than I can say for the burger
A beef patty arrived solo on bread, accompanied by fried chards of shoe-string potato (can I have some potato with that grease?)
I requested tomato and lettuce from the server
She informed me a tomato slice was impossible; I could use the arugala side ($6) for lettuce
But she would bring me ketchup and mustard
After I looked at her incredulously, that was the last time we saw her until the check
Bottom line, this restaurant takes its menu too seriously, and that's long before they consider it beneath themselves to provide basic accompaniments for a $15 burger
The fun crowd and the scene have long moved on
Go to any number of alternatives in the Village for a far better dining experience
When I got to the restaurant at around 6:15 on a Saturday night, I knew there would be a wait, and wasn't too upset to hear it was around 40-45 minutes
Unfortunately, the estimate was waaaayyy off, and we actually waited an hour and a half
When we finally managed to get seated, our waiter was very nice and recommended the gnudi to us
If you go, you must order this addictive dish (we may go back- at some very strange off-peak hour, mind you) just for these delicious, cheesy pasta
The apple and pear salad and smoked haddock soup were also stand-outs, but it seemed like our entrees weren't as good as the appetizers
The roasted bass was good, but not stellar, and the burger wasn't anything special
I was too full to really get into the desserts, but the flourless chocolate cake and ginger cake were delicious
I might never have made my way especially to TSP had it not recently been awarded a Michelin Star
I'm glad I did - yet might not again unless in the neighbourhood
For those lucky enough to live closeby, TSP carries a decent lineup of beers and an extensive wine list
Salads appetizers/mains are complemented by specials, including (that evening) tasty steamed cockles with chorizo, and an over-salted yet curiously bland Berkshire pork soup with pureed vegetables
An entree of veal breast stuffed with veal sausage did not quite deliver, however the cheese plate and ginger cake dessert were hits
The pub has large windows, lots of exposed wood, and atmospheric lighting - heavy curtains, drawn as end of night lockdown approached, were a particularly authentic touch
Bottom line: TSP offers food a cut above your average pub grub, ambiance in spades, and a friendly, easy-going welcome
This place is PERFECT for a casual night wih great food, drink and atmosphere
Just because Mario is a partner don't expect high end, but expect perfection for a gastropub in NY! The gundi are great
LITTLE NUGGETS OF LOVE!!! The burgers are exactley what you are craving
(THINK BISTRO)
While we enjoyed our entrees, the warm potato salad appetizer was waay overpriced and not great
The main complaint was that the service was beyond dreadful for a place of supposedly such a high calibre
Our waiter was maybe the worst I've seen anywhere, well in the top two anyway
Also the seating is like prefab tables set up for kids at a grandmother's house
Certainly wouldn't call it a trendy place
Typically in NY a good publicist sells the place and the droids follow!
The first time I went to the Spotted Pig, I thought 'wow, now why haven't I been here before?' it is a great neighborhood spot
I can go on and on about the bartender, doorman, waitress, manager, everyone! I haven't tried the food, although it seems like there were a lot of people enjoying the food there
Great prices, great people watching place!
The place is small, the host was friendly and communicative -- we had to wait 45 minutes for a table but they don't take reservations and clearly it's a popular spot
Our waitress was great -- let us know that she was swamped and thanked us for waiting
Nice place for a casual date
The greens were quite salty however the menu offerings were above average
Wine by the glass selection was limited
Nice neighbourhood place
a very lovely place to have lunch
went with english friend to have brunch and we both enjoyed it very much
only had to wait 10 minutes for a table, though it was a beautiful sat afternoon
service was nice and efficient
the food was yummy
will definitely go again
met friends here on an early (6pm) sunday evening hoping to avoid the crowds
not a chance - still had to wait 45 min for a table
place had charm but figured food had to be good because of the crowd
well
there's a cook w/ a heavy-hand on the salt
from our burgers to ravioli special to side of fiddle and ramps (which we absolutely had to send back because the salt made it unedible) all made us extremely thirsty (is this the reason?)
the only dish not salty was the lamb's tongue which we all found quite tasty
we left 2 hrs later w/ the place still jam packed
why?
I expected to hate the Spotted Pig based on some rather pointed Citysearch user reviews
I expected to wait four hours for a table and then have the worst service imaginable
But since it was on the Bon Apptit Hot 50 list and since I will never be able to afford Per Se (also on the list), I've been wanting to check this place out for a while
Yes it's crowded and cramped
The places hemorrhages scenesters, but I went on a Wednesday night at 7pm, which seems more manageable than a Friday night
Go for the ricotta gnundi
I cannot stress this more
It will make that hour long wait at the bar worth it
Would I go back? Maybe when the hype dies down a little or if I have an ungodly craving for their ricotta gnudi
It may happen
Yes, there's a wait - so don't be starving
And it's cramped quarters but for a casual meal I would definitely head here for the light and tasty gnudi and a hearty burger
Nothing fancy, no frills and it's definitely a beer-type establishment
Try an off-time and you won't have the crowds clamoring for another Batali hot spot
went to the spotted pig last weekend for a friend's birthday and had to wait three hours for a table! after an hour and a half of waiting we gladly agreed to split our party of eight
little did we know that we would still have to wait another hour and a half to be seated! the atmosphere is charming, the waiters are cute and the food is good, but you need to be prepared to wait for a table
and a friend brought a cake for the birthday girl, which they gladly served for us
although when we received our check we found out that they charge a serving fee for the cake of $5 per person!
The food is generally very good - the martinis however are always horrible! Opt for the beer
After living in London for years, I can tell you- this is not your typical pub- it's small and overpriced
However, I would go back
The food was above average, there is a good atmosphere and the crowd was cool
It's laid back and definately casual upscale
Music was just the right level and lighting was good
I was able to have a nice conversation!
Why is this a gastropub again? Each of my two ventures beyond the burger--the braised oxtail and the smoked trout--was mediocre, at best
The unusual decor and distinguished parentage (Batali) keep the place on the trendy list for now, but probably not for long
Maybe after a little time, when the waits come down and the strength of the bar shows through, the Spotted Pig will settle into its comfortable and rightful place as a solid neighborhood joint
Okay the ingredients used are the best
and they should be
But the proportions and display of simplicity do not warrant the prices
$15

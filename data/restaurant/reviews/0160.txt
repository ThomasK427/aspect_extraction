Definitely pay a visit
I went to Rosa Mexicana a few weeks ago with a friend
To start with - the maitre'd forgot our reservation and then when it came time to sit us down - he told us we only had an hour
He was so obnoxious and didn't even apologize for forgetting about us
Then we sit down and the food is out within 3 minutes
The food was good but we definitely felt rushed
It's obvious the food is pre-cooked here
There are better restaurants in the city
Don't waste your time here!
the food was great, however i felt really rushed to leave
overall, recommended for a great quick bite to eat
I only went because I had a $100 certificate AMEX sent me
My date and I each had two rounds of drinks, two entrees (one being the Filet and it was NOT GOOD - SMOTHERED IN MUSHROOMS AND SAUCES - COULDN'T EVEN FIND THE MEET) and two appetizers and we had our bill paid all in fifty minutes
I hate being rushed and especially when spending almost $175 on two people
It just seemed like a euro tourist trap
The experience was a great one, i went there with a date
MAKE RESERVATIONS
The date was not so good, but the food and the service made up for it
After the date, i stayed at the bar and enjoyed the icredible margaritas, and subsequently, called several of my friends, and we stayed at the bar and ordered food and drinks
This is a classy place with great food (the best in NYC) and a great young feel
Highly recommended
We were seated promptly for our reservation made through opentable
com
Our server was, without any doubt, one of the best I've ever had in New York (and we all know how hard that is sometimes!)
I highly recommend the guacamole and filet with mushroom tequilla sauce
Read the reviews of the East Side Location, then read the West side location reviews - Decided to go to the West side one, and was pleasantly surprised and pleased
Our waiter was more than excellent, there was even 1 in our party that was going to join us 1 hour into dinner, so i made reservations for 4, and they didn't have a problem with seating us at a 4 top even though we were only 3
the place is beautiful!!! sooo cool
the food was pretty good - i like the guac
i did order the special veggie item with pine nuts -no longer on the menu, but i asked for veggie dish and the waiter immediatly brought up that one
will go again
Ohh its like heaven in your mouth ! They make the guacomole at your table it is delicious ! Everything we had was delicious actually portions are huge ! ( Maybe a little too huge as everything was so good we were stuffed leaving this place), but I would definitely go back ! It has a very cool atmosphere as well
I love the water fountain wall with the diving sequence, so original !
After reading all of the bad reviews for this place, I was skeptical about going with my co-workers
I got to choose the place of dining on this particular night and I didn't want to disappoint anyone
And I'm very happy to say that no one was disappointed
The margaritas were excellent (the Herradura tequila is sooo wonderful) and the food was better than any mexican I've had in awhile (and my boyfriend and I go mexican about once a week)
We had really great service, our waiter was very attentive but not pushy in any way
All of the staff seemed very friendly and we encountered nothing but smiles
Maybe they changed the waitstaff since those other reviews were written, I don't know, but overall, it was a nice experience and I am definitely going back
The Columbus Circle/Lincoln Center location and interior design are very impressive! The tiny figures of divers, water fall and other cool architectural features
That's probably all about it
Food was one of the worst and pricy of all mexican places I have ever been to, service was even worse
Too pushy and unfriendly
Going there is Definitely waste of money
I prefer to pay for the ticket to the nice Art Museum to my Aesthetic satisfaction and have dinner in different place for the smaller price to my Appetite fullfilment rather than staring at all their Glamour and staying hungry and annoyed
My husband, my college room mate and I met here for dinner to celebrate his new job and her 30th birthday
Three friends joined us there for a drink
After each of them had had one drink, one of the managers came up to our table and told us that he no longer felt comfortable serving us any more margaritas
He was stumped when asked why
We are 30 plus year olds, very gainfully employed, were not being loud or obnoxious, there were other diners around us as well as a bunch of people at the bar and nobody seemed to have a problem with us except for this manager
He was rude and disrespectful and managed to ruin the entire evening for us - I have never been refused service in a restaurant let alone in the New York equivalent of Chili's
I will never go back
Good margaritas and a delicious meal
The Enchiladas suizas were so tasty with a good amount of chicken
I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size
Everyone was pleased
My three sisters were in town recently and we decided to go here before our show in Time Square
The food was amazing! Our server was so friendly and made the experience that more enjoyable for us! We tried a bunch of apps and then shared a few main courses! Not one of us disliked a dish! The drinks were also amazing, although the sangria was not that great, 2 much grape juice!!! I will definitely come back here soon!
Having been disappointed by the East side location, I thought I'd pop in for a quick drink, chips and guac before a 7pm show at LC
That quickly changed when I saw the layout (hip), the menu (somehow seemed better?), and the hospitality when they squeezed us into a table
Had that guac and chips, plus an incredible lump crabmeat enchilada, plus the divine pomegranate margarita
Told server we had to rush, and Leo took spectacular care of us, water glasses always filled and tortillas warm and fresh
They deserve every accolade -- I'll commonly spend twice the money for half the enjoyment
Go!
That's as Mexican as you can get at this place
Too much attitude, food was shamefully bad, gladly the portions are small
Cuisine? LOL! Drinks were over priced (vodka drink and a xx equis: $16 and no change for my $20)
We must have been asked atleast 5 times if we wanted refills, too bad they weren't so preocuppied in 'pushing' food
The joke was on us really
We were excited and fell for the good advertising
Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere and get some decent Mexican food drink for half the price
All in all said: $75 for dissapointment
Yeah, the food was good (albeit nuevo Mexican), but that was about it
The service was WAY pushy - even after we ordered and said we did NOT want the guac, it was delivered to our table anyways
We also didn't understand the big deal about the pomegrante margarita - it wasn't that tasty and for $10 you would think that you'd be served a little more than a juice glass worth of drink
The crowd was also very touristy (even for the location), and full of kids
There are much better choices for Mexican in the City
If you like margaritas and food that is fresh, festive, flavorful, and filling
go to Rosa Mexicano
It is my boyfriend and I's favorite spot
The pomegranate margaritas are delicious, but potent so beware
they go down like a slushie
The tapas are easy to fill up on, so be careful to save room for dinner
The meats melt in your mouth, the rice and beans are the best I've had, and dessert
oh my gosh
please just go!!! I am making myself hungry!!!
there is only one thing i like about this place is their pomegranite margaurita (sp?) (strong, tasty, and fun!)
however, the rest of the restaurant is mediocre, at best
the food is plain, the guacamole (abiet handmade) is overpriced
i don't get why this place is so popular
i only go here once in a blue moon b/c i live a block away!!
I took my husband to to this restaurant for what I expected would be a deliciously delightful dining experience
It was anything but
The food was way below par considering the price
The fresh-made-at-your-table $14 guacamole was hardly anything to write home about
When you pay a whopping $14 bucks for some avacodo, tomato and chili mashed together, I expect, at the very least, that the portions would be reasonable
NOT HERE!  To top it all off---it took them all of 7 minutes after we ordered to bring out our main courses (fish chicken)
I don't think I've ever been to an upscale restaurant where the service was as hurried as it was here! Our whole dining experience lasted precisely 55 minutes from start to finish and we paid a whopping $80
I will never go to this restaurant again

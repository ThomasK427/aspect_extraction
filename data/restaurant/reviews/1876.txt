The food is great
Corn is a given as well as the spicy shrimp! Be prepared to chill as you wait for a table and to feel cozy with your neighbor since seating is tight
If you're a high maintenance person than this is not the place for you
The servers are cute and fun to chat with as well as being well schooled on the menu
I noticed that regulars were treated like gold as well as newcomers
This is an upscale diner no more no less and the energy is great
Kudos to the fab waitress with the afro and killer smile who suggested the perfect meal along with the tall drink of water making margaritas like a mad man behind the bar
As long as you go with the attitude of taking it easy than you will have a great time
we had to wait 20 minutes for our table in the crowded restaurant but it was worth it
the corn on the cob had a cheese and spicey topping
the heat caught me off guard because it slowly buildings
i had the skirt steak with rice and beans
i requested medium well but when it came, it was medium rare
the mango margarita slush drink was great
my favorite is the pork adobo sandwich and the corn
the chilli powder on it makes it sooo tasty
if you go on the take out side, i reccomend you have someone hold your seat while you're waiting on line
This was, a while back, a hot spot
People still line up here, but I have no clue for what
The 'famous' grilled corn is often served burned and covered in thick layers of butter and cheese, no corn taste whatsoever
Cuban sandwiches come on cool bread, not pressed as they are supposed to be, and with dry chunks of pork
Frozen margs are watery
There're plenty of better Mexican alternatives (that's right, this place is primarily Mexican) in the neighborhood
The Mexican style grilled corn (that's right, I said grilled corn) is worth a visit alone! I have never had the likes of it before, it's absolutely amazing! Service was fine, and about on par with what you'd expect from this casual a setting
I'd go back anytime!!!!
THEY MAKE THE BEST BURRITOS, ESPECIALLY VEGETARIAN BURRITOS (GO VEG PEOPLE) my favorite thing is the avocado and white cheese burrito, i swear, i have never had a better burrito
BEST place for burritos and the MANGO DRINK, WOW, SO GOOD, get take out, and you only wait like 5-10 minutes, i have never waited longer!
went here thursday afternoon and the waitress was a little hottie
anyway, as they serve breakfast pretty late, i went for the steak and eggs which were very tasty
the unexpected surprise was that the home fries were AWESOME
my friend had the huevos rancheros (delicious)
beware of the hibiscus ice tea, unless of course you're already familiar with it
did i mention that the waitress was a hottie?
Okay
The weekends are insane, especially in the summer, but it's still a strong contender with good food
this place is ok
but is not cuban by any means
So stop saying you are!!!!
Ok, the food is good BUT do I really have to pay to get treated as if they are doing ME a favor??? Come on the food is really not that good I usually dont complain about service because I dont intend to marry the staff, but the things you have to endure at Caf Havana, besides the 20-minutes-means-one-hour wait, are really not worth my time nor money!
After waiting for one hour to get a table, we finally were able to sit down
We were a party of five and one of our friends was a few minutes late
The waitresses went to our table and asked us where the fifth person was, and we said that she would be there in a couple of minutes
They said that if she didn't arrive in 5 minutes they would have to ask us to leave
We could not belive what we were hearing
They returned a couple of times asking us to leave or if we wanted to wait for the next table available in a very, very rude manner
After not more than 5 minutes after we got our table (which we had waited for for one hour), we left so mad and dissapointed
We will never come back again
It was the worst service ever !!!
maybe take away- their cafe leche is superior but i don't like their ways there- and much of a deal for nothing again
oh well, see this is what attract the crowds apparently-
Eating at Cafe Habana itself is never the greatest experience
While most of the food on the menu is good and very authentic, the hole-in-the-wall size of the restaurant combined with the number of people looking to be served causes chaos
Getting takeout however, is a great idea
The corn on the cob is to die for and the grilled steak is excellent
service at this restaurant is absolutelly horrible!!!! waitress came to our table to take order with food in her mouth
we waited for our food for almost one hour and needed to ask her 3 times for our drink order and she made us feel like she was doing a favor for us
food is ok, over priced for what it was, but i don't care about that
feels like wasted time and money
of course i didn't tip her though
she didn't deserve a cent
The wait wasn't that bad despite the fact that I was famished
Although the food had little to do with anything Cuban, besides the cuban sandwiches and mojitos, the menu was very creative and had a mexican flare to it
If you're into inventive menus, this is a must- I dont think I even need to mention the corn
it was great!! Try the pork chops with goat cheese
there was enough for dinner leftovers the next day and a great value
Drinks were also good and I found the waitstaff to be very pleasant although not that attentive
but who cares, the food kicked ass!!
This place was great
Begining with the mojitos, followed by the taquitos, the corn, striped bass special, and the steak enchiladas all exceeded my expectations
The steak in both dishes was really, really good (tender, succulent, and well seasoned)
As others have written the corn is very good, though a bit cheesy if you don't like that sort of thing
Also, the prices were extremely reasonable
I look forward to returning soon
The steak enchilada leftovers made for a superb late night snack after going out
We were lucky enough that we didn't have to wait
We got there just before the crowd
But by the time we left, the line was long
It was my first time there and it was awesome
I can see that service may not be their priority, but the staff were not rude
We got what we needed, timely
I LOVED the corn, wished I had gotten a few more orders
The food in general was great and I would go back in a heart beat!
Went here on a Saturday evening and waited over an hour, but was told that the corn alone would make it worth it
I wasn't too sure
Boy, was I wrong! The three of us got two orders and we were fighting over it
It is amazing! The restaurant was loud, our waitress was awesome, but the other waitresses seemed rude
The margarita on the rocks was good and the rest of our food was yummy, but the corn was the star
I'm not sure I would run back there to sit down and eat, but I would definitely go all the way across town for the corn from the to-go place next door
It's definitely worth it
Given the wait and the slightly lagging service, the food is fantastic, atmosphere even better, and mojitos and corn the prime stars
The corn, slathered in mayo and parmesian (although it didn't work when i tried it at home) is fantastic and the mojitos, although super sweet and not original, taste great! It's best to put your name down and walk around SoHo while you wait the 40-something minutes
I also recommend the chicken with mole sauce
4pm on President's Day and we had a great bite to eat at the counter
Tasty blackened chicken sandwiches, molletes and cafe con leche were served swiftly
We all enjoyed the delicious food, fun atmosphere, and sweet wait staff
We'll be back
For starters, this restaurant is Mexican! Not Cuban as some people seem to think
And this was confirmed by the bartender who FYI didn't speak a word of Spanish
The service definitely was unimpressive especially given the small space
The corn was baby

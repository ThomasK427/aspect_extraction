The Scene You can't miss this scene from the sidewalk: windowed garage doors wrap around a gigantic industrial dining room, where black-clad bartenders pour wine into short-stemmed glasses and fashionable diners chat around schoolhouse tables and chairs
It's loud and fun, with casual service that's refreshingly serious about the food
The Food The menu fuses Waxman's seasonal aesthetic, honed at Chez Panisse and Jam's in California, with rich and rustic Italian country cooking
It's a smart match, yielding the likes of shaved asparagus salad, sharp with pecorino vinaigrette, lightly dressed wild arugula with velvety chicken liver bruschetta and delicate braised rabbit with tiny, spicy penne
But the real shining stars include any entree emerging from the wood-burning oven--sea bass is beautifully tender; fava pesto-slathered scallop skewers are buttery and sweet; and rosy lamb, perfection with spring peas
The dark-chocolate pudding is among the best in its class
the place was nice but too dark, i could not read my menu
the staff was nice
great people all around
had a great time
you will too
Went there recently for early dinner (5:30pm or so)
Hostess informed us that the menus are being printed and it wont be long
The place was pretty much empty
Nevertheless, it took awhile to get any service
Finally, the waitress showed up, not paying attention to what I asked
People from the kitchen came out put a ladder right next to our table and started changing a ight bulb (3 men changing 1 bulb); lights started flickering, then they knocked out the circuit, so the lights went out
Then they decided to move us to another table
My small serving of pasta was ok, but certainly not worth 17$, and maybe 20 cents worth of boiled pasta, neither was my boyfriend's chicken, which didnt even come with any garnish
The waitress was a bit spaced out
We had to wait to get water, etc
Just bad, would not recommend!
Dined there last night Was seated promptly Upon being seated our drink order was taken and our app order as well, the server told us that she must wait til the full order was taken before it could be punched in b/c the kitchen is swamped
(Though the cooks were standing around looking at each other) After she took full order, brought out drinks but no apps, asked if she remembers we ordered proscuitto, she says yes i punched it in before, as we finish talking, I can see her punch it into the machine
The proscuitto comes with BURNT bruschetta
I ordered pasta as 1st, and the pork chop as a 2nd
They arrived at the same time, she admitted to messing up the sequence, no apology
I would love to go back to eat, but not if the service continues that way
despite the fact that some of the people who I met when I dined there were slightly expectant the staff was very courteous
The food tasted really good, the baccala was great and thier pork ribs were even better
I like it that much more when the waiter explained that they deal with only local organic small farms
Everything was fresh
My son had their childrens pasta and ate it ALL! WoW
IDO recommend and I will go back
We had great service for our meal--and our group had 7 people! Don't know what happened with the other reviews
hostess and waiter really wonderful
Thanks
had a reservation, they couldn't honor it, even after stalker calling me 3 x's during the day to confirm the res
we were a party of 4 - 1 person sent their meal back, my app - crispy eggplant- was terrible, bitter and my entree wasn't much better - i had the scallops - and they were bland/average
my fiance's food was horrible - all you could taste was salt
the 4th person had a so-so meal as well
overall the food was below average, service average
if you like the scene i'd recommend just going to the bar for a drink and having dinner elsewhere -plenty of good places in the neighborhood
Dont come here just because it's in a trendy neighborhood
I came with some friends from out-of-town and i was embarrassed for picking such a terrible place! the service was
filled with attitude and overall mean
The waiters and waitresses were incompetent, snotty, and forgetful
Not only did they bring all the wrong dishes, they also messed up the drink order and then tried to pass it off as if we had ordered what she brought! (im sorry, but i know what drink I want!) The pasta was UNDER UNDER cooked- lets just say it was just as crunchy as biting into a pretzel
The steak dish was ok, but the pork sandwich was way too dry
There are plenty of better places to go to in that neighborhood
Barbuto is great, especially on a nice evening
It feels like you are eating outside, but with a roof over your head
The food is all very simple, nothing extravagant but certainly quite good, and at reasonable prices
We had a pasta dish and the pork chop, both were delicious
It's a very happenning scene, being in the meatpacking and all
our service was also great
Be sure to request a table in the main area, there is a section behind the hostess stand that is a bit out of the way and not as nice as the main area
place is terrific
food is excellent
scallop entree tho was more like an appetizer -- i think 3 scallops is a bit stingy and not at all standard
atmosphere is phenomenal -- really relaxing
My only beef with this place is the hostess - nightmarishly haughty with really no reason to be
We had made rezies for 2 and had to convert them into 3 when a friend unexpectedly joined us and she was totally unforgiving and we had to start anew - she just completely second class citizened us - my instinct was to get confrontational but i decided to write this review instead and make my feelings known publicly
After arriving for a pre-theatre reservation to find the kitchen closed due to a mechanical failure, the problem was fixed an hour later (after many drinks at the bar, none of which management offered as a concession to the wait) and we were served a very good dinner in time to make the play
The dark chocolate gelato is to die for and the service was prompt and friendly
Would return
Called to make a reservation for 6p, Tuesday
Was told that reservations were accepted only for groups of 4 max because the food wouldn't come out together
Said we wouldn't mind that
So she said she'd ask the chef's permission
IF he allowed it, we'd only be able to eat at 5h45 or 1045
Chef said no
Called again later, and another person took the reservation no questions asked!!!   Asparagus soup-$7; risotto-$14 for 4 bites; entrees, meat or fish with nothing else, so you had to order contorini-$5 -if you wanted to have some semblance of a meal; flavorless flounder-$17- supposedly cooked in the wood oven
Would have been much better cooked in the skin until crisp
Dessert, torta di limone $8 which was really a slice almond pouncake with lemon that was barely there
$16 for Grappa in a shot glass
Okay, so I have to say, the highlight of the night beyond the great food and atmosphere was the manager, as we had an issue with the table behind us
One of the girls at our table and one of the girls at their table were catty, which the other girl brought to the manager's attention
Regardless of who started it/was at fault, the manager took time as we left to find out the source and make sure we were fine
I wouldn't expect that type of behaviour from a manager at my favorite restaurant much less somewhere I'd never been! That was so cool what she did, so un-necessary b/c the girl at the other table made a mountain out of a molehill
Nice surprice! The place place was great to begin with but the actions of the manager were unbelievably appreciated
I will definitely be back
I liked Barbuto because it wasn't your run of the mill looking Italian joint
It was nestled in the West Village/Meatpacking District on a relatively quiet part of the city
It's a great place to people watch and the atmosphere was inviting to hang at the bar before or after dinner
I look forward to the Spring as it's a great place to have lunch and a drink when the garage doors open up
Oh yeah, the food was real good too
Went to a birthday dinner with a party of 7
We were not able to get the chef's table but we managed to get the private room
I think they tried the shabby chic approach with the interior but didn't quite make it
Not too bad but not impressed
We all ordered different dishes and shared but most of the food was average
The only really good one was the special pasta of the day (linguine)
I ordered the over-roasted chicken and it was kind of dry
I think it would be a good place to go in the summer when it becomes open air for drinks but wouldn't really recommend this place to a foodie
I had a great night at Barbuto
From the tasty appetizers through dessert I was impressed by not only the diverse menu but also the charming waitstaff who was more than accommodating to me and my party
I also really liked the scene which was trendy but not too over the top and even better, the food is completely affordable which is hard to find these days in the meatpacking district
I will definitely be back soon!!
We were seated forty minutes after our orginal reservations

Made reservations for seven on a Thursday night and had no problem getting seated or getting drinks served right away
The place was not crowded yet and had the perfect amount of noise/music so that we could hear all of us talking
We all got different appetizers and entrees and all of it was great
We had great service, possibly since it wasn't brunch and it wasn't overflowing with people yet
They gave us a free slice of cake for my friends birthday and it was overall a great birthday dining spot
The food here is phenomenal, the drinks are OK and the value is astronomical
You won't find a better meet-n-greet place with this kind of consistancy
The problem is the service
The host is downright rude
make reservations and you will still wait
walk in and you'll wait forever
They overfill the reservation sheet so that the check is dropped off nearly with your food and they are rushing you out of your booth before you are finished
The last time, the hostess came to our table THREE times to tell us she needed the table
I was not even close to done with my food! Finally, she bribed us with a free round at the bar to get up
I love the food so I will go back but don't expect to be charmed by the staff
If you get there by 11:30 am w/o a reservation, you might actually get a table
Make reservations! The menu is mixed and has plenty of options
Great crowd and ambiance although very loud for a sunday brunch
I highly reccommend the Wednesday Lobster Night Special at Essex
We went with a large group and ordered about a dozen decent sized lobsters with potatoes and corn for $14 each as well a the best mammoth crab cakes I have ever had
Our waitress also chose an unusual and affordable white wine that worked well with lobster
I have also been here for brunch which was EXTREMELY CROWDED though food was excellent
We made reservations for a large group of 10
Although we were seated quickly, we waited over an hour for our food
We were starving and the restaurant was not crowded so we didn't understand the long wait
During the time that we waited for our food, we saw other diners order, receive their meal, and leave the restaurant
The wait was ridiculous, and the food was mediocre
I would not return
have done brunch there many times now, and we keep going back because the food is very good, the booze is free-flowin', and the people watching is great
also, as many have mentioned, it's a steal for $15
but the host is always, ALWAYS rude, the wait is always long and uncomfortable, and they don't accept reservations for parties smaller than six
the one time we tried to make a reservation for a large group, they refused and told us we couldn't be accommodated
one time, we had to wait 10 minutes with our food in front of us because they were out of forks
still, it's worth dealing with terrible customer service for the great food and scene
Last Sunday had brunch with large group
Made reservation day prior for 14, 1:15 pm
Seated just after 2; I commend them 'cause they were the only decent brunch spot that would take our reservation, and they did their best to seat us promptly
Hostess was quite attentive
Brunch $15 (for the most part), includes up to 3 mimosas, bloody marys, etc
Menu is large (more than 20 different options), theres something for everyone
However, as with their dinner (which I've had once prior), I thought my dish (the Mexican one) was only slightly above average
Most at the table thought their meals were rather lackluster
For $15 including 3 mixed drinks, it's still a good deal
Most will leave feeling full, a little tipsy for a relative bargain, but for smaller groups and/or better food, try one of the other spots on Rivington
there are plenty of em
My friend made a 12:30p reservation for two for sunday brunch
At 1:15p, we left without being seated
The place is a zoo and no food is that good
Essex lounge is one of the best places for brunch in NYC
Not only is it a cool spot with great music and ambience (yes it does get a little noisy

but it is in LES
Very trendy spot, what else would you expect?), the service is good too
The food is excellent, I recommend the chicken-apple sausage, (to die for!) and unlimited mimosas! (Well the menu says three per person then there is an additional charge but I haven't seen any of the wait staff count yet
Especially with a large party)
Because the spot is so popular up you may have to wait depending on the number in your party
It is never a ridiculous wait no more than 30 minutes, in the meantime you can chat with your friends and start the week-end off right with a signature drink from the bar! Salut and Enjoy!
Once we found this restaurant, which has no address and resembles a schoolhouse on the outside, we were pleasantly surprized by the lofty space and the creative yet affordable menu
The lamb chops with chorizo wontons and the chilean seabass were both winners as was the black and white cookie cake
Our server was attentive and helpful in a typically downtown casual way
Great music too
Went there with a group of 12 for brunch yesterday
We had a reservation, for which 11 of 12 were on time
The obnoxious hostess would not seat us because we were short one person! She did however threaten us with a $10 charge for the missing person
After an hour of waiting she sat us at a table which was more suitable for 8 people, where we had 4 different servers
Not one order came out correct
After sitting for 40 minutes, before most of had finished our food, or even our first of the included 3 drinks the same hostess said that it was a beautiful day and that we should be outside enjoying it
We told her that we were'nt done eating, to which she replied That's too bad, because i need this table
It's a beautiful day- you should be outside
I will not be returning
The brunch as Essex is so good
The menu is varied so everyone in your group will be happy
From the hostess to the servers everyone was very pleasent
My girlfriend and I have been going to the essex for brunch quite regular and we tried the Essex for Dinner on a Wednesday night for the first time
It is much quieter than brunch, which is more of a cool scene, but the lobster special for $14 is amazing
We also had a cod with bacon and potatoes that was awsome like nothing I never had
Will be back for dinner more often
SUCH a disappointment! We waited 40 minutes to be seated, even though we had a reservation
Server seated 8 of us at two teensy bar tables pushed together, right next to the crowded, noisy bar
We asked to be moved to a quieter, larger table and were given serious attitude
Our table was served by a variety of waiters and busboys so we never had any idea who to flag down
Two minor changes to my order--no dressing on my salad and a vegetable substition--were blatantly ignored
The food all came out at different times, and was average at best; my meal was little more than a glorified chicken nugget
The restaurant was way too loud for conversation, and totally overcrowded (tables crushed up against each other; waitresses wading through crowds at the bar)
Maybe I caught it on a bad night, but I won't be giving Essex another chance!
Essex has great deals for happy hour
I didn't check out their thursday Lobster night, but I went on wednesday and found dollar oysters, great oysters from the east and west coast and 2 for 1 drinks
It was a nice crowd, not too overbearing or loud, cool atmosphere, and strong drinks
I know this place has a line down the street for the brunch, and I'm surprised they don't have the same for their Wednesdays and Thursdays
Highly Recommended
Essex has become a good local hangout for many of my friends
The Thursday Happy Hour is one of my favorite in NYC
They have west and east coast oysters for $1 each and half price drinks
There is plenty of room in what has to be one of the most open spaces in the neighborhood
The unlimited bloody Mary Brunch is hands down the best in the City, if not the World
Four Thumbs up
One Saturday afternoon we decided to try out Essex
we had heard that it was good
Unfortunately all the reviews were moot due to the horrible service we received
How horrible? We didn't even get our food served after 1

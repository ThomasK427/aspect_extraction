Seafood pastas, such as squid ink ravioli with sweet lump crab and chewy pappardelle with asparagus and whole shrimp, stand out, but meat dishes, like too-dry balsamic-glazed guinea hen, are hit-or-miss
Superb thin-crust pizzas are the second best items to emerge from the blazing brick oven behind the bar; whole grilled fish, like orata laced with lemons and herbs, are the first
Great ambience, perfect service, and wonderful food
I had the pleasure to meet the owners who know their Italy
The place has a sense of family and it was a delight to find out it was run by a tight-knit family who have passion for their establishment and menu
I highly recommend Mezzogiorno for the tasty food, the excellent service, and especially, the outdoor seating
Not too jet-set flashy, not at all pretentious
just right
They even went out of their way to accomodate our large group of twelve
Popped in by accident on friday night
big time mistake !! I got there with my husband aspecting nothing but delicious landmark Italian food,instead, we got tasteless pizza, salty pasta dishes and over cooked Expensive prices, not compatible with the service they offer
The place may be clean,and the decor nice, but does not match at all the citysearch guide line
A VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !!
The food is great
Nothing is overdone the flavors are balanced
Our waiters were helpful and handsome
I just wish we were allowed to keep a bottle of olive oil on the table
I use to go to this restaurant years ago and then as others opened with their concept I actually forgot about them
Now , years later I revisited them and I am so happy that I did
The food is easy going, fresh and delicious
I love the ravioli and also the mezzo salad
They must be good because after years , I recognized the same waiters
I can honesly say that Mezzogiorno were trend setters
Before them Italian food was chicken parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs Little Italy style
The pizza, pasta, and salads are out of this world! This restaurant is as steady as they come
I am a neighbor and frequent guest and have NEVER had a poor experience at this restaurant
For light eating there is no rival
Summer time out door seating is a added pleasure
What an amazing lunch! Great service and delicious food
I have a thing about Italian restaurants who don't make their own pasta and this place was just perfect
Homemade noodles cooked perfectly al dente!
The place is the perfect lounge
Thick velvet curtains, super comfy couches, and incredible, oversized martini's
The DJ had girls dancing up on the tables
I'm glad I found this no-named, secret place
cause, I was bored by the club scene and too overdressed for the local bar
This place was just my speed
I bought a bottle of Ketel One and the hostess whisked me and some friends to a back table
I had the best time in a while and I'll be back
Bravo, this place rocks
My husband and I lived in Japan for 3 years and go back frequently and this place is very authentic, especially the handmade soba
I love noodles but was not wowed by this place
Everything including the noodles and the tempura tasted so clean and organic that it was tasteless and I left unsatisfied
But some people like that
The texture of the noodles are great though
Portions are small
Prices are high
Service is on the slow side
The restaurant itself is very clean and zen like
The total experience was just okay
My husband and I ordered the yellowtail sashimi appetizer and the fish was fresh and tasty
My husband had the crushed tempura and green onion hot soba entree and he liked it very much
I, on the other hand, thought my fish cake, chicken and veggie hot soba entree was average, and there were less noodles in the soup than I expected
We had the Japanese version of cheesecake and green tea roll cake for dessert
Both were excellent but were portioned so that you were done in 4 small bites
In all, our meal came out to $65 pre-tip and without wine
That would have been a decent amount for dinner if it filled you up, and it did not
I didn't have a good enough experience here to want to go back, but my husband liked his meal enough to want to try other soba dishes
The ambience was very nice and zen, like another reivews indicated
The food was average
The service was very good
It was my frist time having soba noodles and I would go again, but try other soba dishes
(I had the cold soba with seaweed, it was yummy! The broth was especially good!) Portions were average, not too large
Had a few appetizers; smoked duck was served cold but good flavor, tofu was good/fresh too, nothing to rave about though
Yellowtail was fresh
Prices were a bit high for noodles in my opinion
I would return for the ambience!
Nobody does soba better than Honmura An
Choose your soba to be served either hot or cold with your choice of topping
An extensive list of Japanese appetizers is also featured and were all hits on a recent visit
The lunch price fixe meal is a bargain
The ambience is serene, almost zen like
Service can be a bit lax during busy times
Watch the soba makers through the glass windows in the back making the wheat noodles by hand
Soba is best eaten fresh and no place serves fresher soba than Honmura An
If not everyone in your part is there, they basically just ignores you
After everyone was seated, they waited extremely long to bring us the menu
Didn't even offer water or anything to drink
We had to request the drink menu, tea, and water by ourself
They wouldn't even refill our water without us asking
The food was really good but the service was just so terrible that it really ruined my whole dinning service
Honmura An is definitely a special place where the homemade soba noodles are amazing
Sure it's a bit pricey compared to some other places, but the quality of ingredients totally justifies the price (although compared to Japan, it's reasonable)
everything from the accompaniments to the broth is first rate
Other menu items are also solid
The soba sushi rolls are very interesting, and sashimi, if available, rivals many of the top sushi houses in the city
The only other place that can even compare are the green tea soba noodles from Kai
Great Soba ($9 ~ $14 range)
Bit pricey if you want to get full
We ordered a shirmp tempura appetizer (2 shrimps $21
95), fish cake appetizer ($9), and two soba dishes
Everything was delicious, especially the fish cake appetizer
I wouldn't order the shirmp tempura appetizer in the future;$21
95 is too much for only 2 shrimps despite how large they were
who was it that said you will spend a lot of $$$ to be full is absolutely correct
Food was very good, soba was excellent, sashimi was fresh
Still don't know why citysearch has it listed as 2 $$
soba sushi is a must try
the place is nice, quiet, and very zen-like
but 20 dollars for a bowl of nabeyaki udon is way too expensive

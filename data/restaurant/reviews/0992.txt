My recco (as someone who loves restaurants/great food), go for drinks, walk around the place and then LEAVE
One last thing, we were seated at our table at 7:15, and were still waiting for some of our food to arrive at 10:50 (we asked for the check to cut our losses)
prices are crazy
Unnecessary
food was good but not phenomenal
maybe if the prices were half off
the added lights that they put in the food for decoration was a little tacky
reminded me of bar mitzvah giveaways
kobe beef tartar was good
salmon tartar was not
sushi was fresh
all other dishes were just mediocre
and we ordered over 10 dishes
Expect to pay 5
00 for an asparagus spear
and 15
00 for edamame
ridiculous
Yelling hello to everyone that comes in gets old real fast
After spending $140 per person, you would expect to feel somewhat full, well not the case at Megu! Sushi was average but way over price, $120 for 12 pieces??? You can much better sushi at half the price
But if you must try the place, give the BBQ stuff a try, it is one of the better items on the menu
I had read many scathing reviews of Megu before dining there last night
Nevertheless, the experience I had there was unbelievable
The decor is exquisite and the crowd is ultra-sophisticated
The long menu (including the cocktail and sake lists) is a little daunting at first, but our waiter was very helpful and after we told him our preferences he led us in the right direction
The foie gras is out of this world, and the noten toro practically melts in your mouth
Yes, it's expensive, but it's absolutely worth it!
I'm a Japanese and neighbor of MEGU
Their food is ok, but it's tooooo expensive! You shoud not spend money for this kind of food!! You can get the food in this quality at the Japanese supermarket
And the ambience and the decor are awful!! I'm so disapointed
A huge disappointment to say the least
I'm from Tokyo so I know what real Japanese food is about - Don't believe the hype!! How can an establishment get away with serving snack size portions (slivers of everything) that taste mediocre at best and charge you a fortune for it?!! Only in New York
Give me a break! The sushi was completely dried up and the eel was so rubbery, I had to swallow it whole
The only good thing I can say about this place is the decor and the hostess's kimono inspired uniforms
Poor service and clueless wait staff were our megu welcome
Food consisted of small serves of very plain favours
Sushi was deli style and not NY restaurant standard
Hot rocks to cook meat at table although fun the meat was tough and rubbery (it was supposed to be Kobe but I was not convinced)
When the bill came I thought it was my next mortgage paynment
This would have to be one of the worst experiences I have had in NY Dining ever
I went to MEGU with my Japanese friends, and they were so impressed
They said the soy sauce is not your typical KIKOMAN, it's handmade in small batches, using only natural ingredients
and rice tasted like one from NIGATA, which is famous for their rice
Moreover, at MEGU, you won't find any powder wasabi at all, but only fresh ones
If this kind of basic is good, you can't go wrong with anything
Only one thing, Kobe beef skewers were not fatty enough, but their riverstone beef was typical Kobe, very well marvelized
Price, yes, a lot expensive, but you're paying for quality
If concern is quantity, don't we have more than enough cheap places in NY?
ONE positive, an absolutely beautiful place! The rest of my experience, terrible, starting with the price, Im certainly not new to the NYC restaurant scene, and have family in the business, but please explain to me how you think you are going to be able to charge those prices, combined with horrible service, finger food, and location that on a most nights is dead as a beach on a rainy day, not to mention it takes a half hour to find a cab, after spending the equivalent of a long weekend in the Carribean
Oh, one other thing, if your going to put slabs of raw meat(Kobe beef) in front of people, dont you think it would be just a bit more presentable if 3/4 of it were not fat? Good luck, and oviously I will not be a return customer, neither will the 7 other guests I was with!
megu is overpriced in a weird way
the food was pretty good and the flashy presentation of dishes was fun too
but, have you noticed their cheap, plastic chinatown serving dishes? that is quite strange
they do have the best bathroom in new york though that smells like the freshest mint
the waitress who served was a little sleepy but the other wait staff were really nice and helpful
overall, i must say that if you want good japanese food this isn't so bad, but so, so overpriced
honestly the other big facotry like new japanese place matsuri is much better, their food is surprisingly amazing and if you make your reservation on a not so crowded night you will have the best experience, although it isn't that cheap either, but it's at least worth it
Megu was the worst dining experience ever
For starters, we had reservations and still had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our table
When we were finally seated, the menus were incredibly confusing we had no idea what we were ordering
Plus the prices were outrageous ($24 for edamame)
To make matters worse, the service was unbelievably slow
We waited an hour for our first course to arrive
The portions were soooo small and the food wasnt even that good (the shrimp was so small they looked like tadpoles)
By 11:30 we still hadnt been served our sushi or our main courses
We were so upset (not to mention STARVING) that we decided to leave the restaurant and find a new place where wed actually be served food!!! The worst part is, no one seemed to care they had angry customers! It was a huge disappointment
Megu is absolutely gorgeous
The staff that greeted us at the door was very pleasant and professional
The food is good (except the calamari--very average) and the presentation was great
But, the service was terrible, portions were small and prices were very high
(i
e
six asparagus spears for $21
00) High prices, small portions and bad service--not a good mix
The Food is amazing
Even without the obvious money that was invested into decor, service, and space, the restaurant makes a statement on supreme culinary excellence
The Kobe beef was my favorite as it melted in my mouth
And the fresh fish is sent over from Japan on a daily basis! I have eaten in good restaurants in Europe and California, but few make the extra effort to bring the authenticity of a high end Japanese restaurant
For that effort alone, Megu is unique and worth a try
The upside of expensive business travel is the opportunity to dine at some world class restaurants, Megu is unequivocally one of them
In terms of food preparation, quality, ambiance, and sheer dining experience, there are only a few restaurants in NYC on par
But it should be noted that if you are price sensitive, Megu is probably out of your league
I had the salmon mousse and the kobe beef
On one occasion I had kobe beef that was almost as good in Tokyo
The salmon mousse is without a peer
Megu is not supposed to be all you can eat sushi; the pieces are small and the taste exquisite, because the food is authentic
For Sallys Suite 16th, save your money
But for a lifetime dining experience, Megu is worth it on a special occasion if you think you can appreciate the taste
Ill be going again
From beginning to end, our evening at Megu was definitely one of the most exceptional dining experiences we've had
Upon being greeted by a friendly hostess at the door, she kindly offered to give us a tour of the restaurant to show us the entire space before taking us into the absolutely amazing main dining room
Service was great and our waiter Dave (who just so happens to resembe Juaquin Phoenix!) was just wonderful
He was so friendly and helpful and made some wonderful recommendations
the salmon toro tartare, the noten tuna, the kobe beef, the shrimp, the squid, the skewered white fish, the asparagus, the sake
everything was perfect! It was money well spent and we're looking forward to our next visit!
Simply amazing -- amazing food, amazing space, amazing atmosphere, amazing service, amazingly fair prices all things considered
This is my new go to place when I am looking to have an all-around dining experience
The menu had dozens of delicious and creative items I've never seen before
And it's not asian-fusion in cuisine or decor, it's real Japanese, making it all the more authentic and impressive
The restuarant is gorgeous!!! The prices were absolutely blown out and inflated

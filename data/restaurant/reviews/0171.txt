I am sure it is great for what it is, but I didn't enjoy my dinner b/c things were a little to much like eating in Japan
If that is your thing then definitely try it
Sushi-yasuda has a large selection of exceptionally fresh fish
Most sushi lovers will dine there and have the opportunity to sample several kinds of fish the have never had
The waitstaff was very friendly if not the most attentive
The fish could definately have been sliced a bit more grenerously
Overall, yasuda is a nice place to go when you want to try fish that you can't get most other places and don't mind paying too much for what you get
The wait staff was very attentive and polite
But, of all the Japanese restaurants I've tried in the city, this is the first where I couldn't finish what I ordered
The rolls and sushi I ordered did not taste fresh at all
This restaurant is amazingly put together with food, service, and decor
Sushi Yasuda is one of the few places in the city where you can get the best and freshest sushi
One word: Omakase
Say this to your server when s/he asks for your order
You have now just authorised the head chef to decide what you will eat
And you will get the best of the selection
And it will cost you
For those who are not as wealthy, mix and match to your wallet
Still NYC sushi reasonable
Okay sorry for the title
but this place is IT for Sushi in NY
Yes have been to all the big places for Sushi in town, but nowhere comes close to Yasuda
The fish just melts on your tongue - have never experienced fish like this
Sat at the Sushi bar so we could watch the chefs prepare
We asked for a spicy tuna roll, but the Sushi chef said 'I'm a Sushi guy, only make real Sushi, I give you scallion and tuna handroll' - and it was amazing
If you're into authentic Japanese
go here
Very exclusive ambiance at night - not for the light-of-wallet
What happened to this place, they used to have over 100 types of fish, now only 11
Right down the tubes, just to save a buck! Go to Taka instead!
one word: wow
fancy yet not over the top, this place has an aura of traditional japanese vibe to it
we sat at the bar and had our personal chef carefully craft each piece of heaven for us
the fish selection and quality is the best i've seen in the city
wonderful service
this place is a true gem for sushi lovers
Great food, service and truely Japanese setting
The spacious restaurant reminds of Japan, not another New York so-called sushi bar
I don't even mind that they don't play any music
They serve some of the freshest fish i've ever tasted
Their crab sushi is actually real crabmeat!  Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to enjoy it as much as one should, because the staff is constantly hovering over you, clearing the table, filling the water
then when they're finished with aone of these tasks, they continue to stand right by your table
How annoying!
The sashimi seemed to melt in my mouth
Simply amazing
The number one sushi restaurant in the city - easily the best fish I have had anywhere
You're dining on raw fish in comfort and style at Sushi Yasuda
Wait-staff is calm and cool
The bait - I mean the fish - is highest-quality
An intimate atmosphere for romance or a business lunch - your choice! Not to be missed!
The best most authentic sushi you can find in NY, but not cheap so dont go there every day
I know my sushi - I lived in Japan for 7 years!!
Yasuda serves simply the best sushi in NYC in a exquisite modern decor
The decor is clean and pure, and so is the sushi
I would recommend asking the sushi chefs for their recommendations
The fish is all very good, whether you choose sushi or sashimi, and the bladework is good
You won't get massive slices of lower quality fish, but you will get well-made seafood
Excellent
Because of the location, the night is often less crowded than the lunch, so I would recommend visiting in the evening
I've been here twice now
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great
The Scene Distinct "azulejos" tiling and ornate Moorish lanterns adorn the blue-and-white restaurant, which is named after a seaside Lisbon neighborhood
The transporting atmosphere offers vacation memories for seasoned travelers, New World variety for locals, and romantic window seats for canoodling couples from near and far
The Food The Portuguese knack for exploration couldn't be more apparent on the expansive menu, which moves beyond classics like bacalhau to encompass a world of former colonies along with the motherland
Rounds of tender octopus drizzled with olive oil and cilantro and soft shreds of duck leg, sweetened by a rich port cinnamon reduction, highlight the authentic traditional tastes, while engaging "new wave" preparations range from juicy seared diver scallops with a Goa-inspired curry oil to Mozambique-influenced chicken breast, smothered in a thick, exotic sauce of chili, ginger, lemongrass, garlic and coconut milk
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending
Very sophisticated interior and food
The service is great! Not only dinner, but also brunch is wonderful!
I go to the Alfama because I go often to Lisbon, and I find the authentic Portuguese food and wine in Alfama of very fine quality
Delicious
Excellent wine list, too
The decor creates a sophisticated replica of the old moorish quarter of Lisbon, the Alfama, and the service and food are on the level of New York highest standards
I go for special events and any other opportunity I can think up
I had to get on and write a thank you to Alfama for a great dining experience
Two friends took me to Alfama for dinner Monday, and they promised me a great dining experience, and boy, they really came thru
I enjoyed my meal so much, I wanted to let everyone know about this West Village jewel
The waiter was amazingly friendly, he took care of our every whim, We got grilled halibut in a carrot sauce, compliments from the kitchen
and then we ordered scallops - cooked perfectly! then our Steaks came and it was Carnivore Heaven! To end the meal, we received Custard cakes after our desserts , again compliments of the kitchen-we really felt pampered
Our waiter was kind enough to bring the Chef out, and that really made the night
Again, thank you for the great experience, You have earned yourselves a new Fan!!
A work-related project took me away from New York for a while and upon my return one of the first things I did was to have dinner at Alfama
I'm glad to have encountered a magnificent spring menu with new and creative dishes, but with the same delicious flavors as I recall them
I was also glad to encounter the same fantastic wine list but with some amazing additions - the 1968 Boal Madeira wine is not to be missed! I was told the summer menu will be coming up shortly, around June 20, and I can't wait to sample that either
The staff, as I recall them, are really sweet, efficient and friendly
Bravi!!!
I discovered this place earlier this year and was pleasantly surprised
The food was fresh, especially the seafood
The service was iffy
This was reinforced as I recently went there with my friends
The person at the coat check was pompous, the waiter didnt know the wine list and we had to work hard to get his attention
The food was OK - go there if you dont mind the bad service
I took my girlfriend for Valentine's day there and was received by THE rudest guy at the front desk
It was snowing because of which we were 5 mins late - this guy began REPRIMANDING us and advised us that in the future, please call ahead
Thank god - there would be no next time!   Then the bread arrived *after* our appetizers (unclear whether the 2 were correlated)
The food was OK - we tried the cheese platter (which was pretty good), the salt cod (too rich) and the chicken (nothing extraordinary)
Also the tables were a little too close for any sort of conversation - hardly expected from a restaurant calling itself 'romantic'
There are lots of good places in the village - take your money elsewhere
I've been going to Alfama for dinner for a number of years, but had never had the opportunity to experience brunch since I live outside of the city, so it's not like I can roll out of bed and be there in just a few minutes

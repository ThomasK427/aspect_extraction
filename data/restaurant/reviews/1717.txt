Decent ambient noise level where one can hear conversation
Oh my lord! The food! I had some sort of chicken/watercress/sweet peppers hot sandwich and every bite of it was to be slowly savoured
And perfect homemade tart lemonade
Nice place to linger over your food
Had Sunday brunch here with a friend - it was chill, laid-back, and the food was pretty good and relatively inexpensive
I like this place as a late nite stop for a good drink and you aren't lookin to party hard, mid week type deal
They have great martini's here but I'm a fan of the 007
Nice layout, very village like with all the brothel type layout and colors
Not many people here during the week and a frequent place for same sex couples
not that there's anything wrong with that!
My boyfriend and I went in there for a leisurely saturday lunch
Walked in, grabbed a menu off a table and sat down
The waiter walked over and (SO RUDELY) asked if we wanted to take our own order and cook it too and was serious!!!! He was busy
we were just trying to help him out rather than awkwardly stand in the doorway
We walked out and have not been back since
I keep trying to call the manager to complain, but they claim she is never in
The food is not all that, and to be honest, either was the waiter
Avoid it!
Terrific place to enjoy a bite to eat and a drink--great date or small group atmosphere
Sexy decor--red and gold wall coverigns, faux crystal chandelliers, loveseats and small tables
A diverse menu
The chicken breast on focaccia and goat cheese grill cheese were both wonderful
Relaxed, unassuming and open late--perfect for midnite on a Tuesday
If you are thinking of dining at Simone, don't plan on getting what you want
Basically, I ordered and I didn't get the right food or even my dessert
A problem that had a simple solution was blown way out of proportion
Instead of getting my dessert, an employee called me, on my cell phone, on my minutes and accused me of incorrectly ordering
He was rude and didn't offer squat
The Scene On initial examination, it's easy to mistake this place for a bar
Art and miscellany adorn the black-painted walls; strings of colored lights, disco balls and TVs are hung here and there; and on weekends a DJ fills the dining room with loud dance beats
All of this makes the environment far from serene, but the leisurely service is courteous and competent
The Food Given the emphasis on spectacle, it's a pleasant surprise that the Japanese menu is so good
A wide variety of sushi concoctions are available, ranging from the simple and traditional to more exotic inventions; but all are distinguished by very fresh fish and skilled preparation
"Blackened" tuna slices dressed with a spicy sauce are delicious, as is a salmon-skin salad with cucumber
Cooked dishes, like nabeyaki, a deep bowl of tender udon, chicken, vegetables and crisp tempura in savory broth, are tasty as well
hmmmmmmm
well i love the sushi and the place forever since it was around, nice to see that they started showing excellent movies again instead of bad action movies, really love that, brought a couple of my friends who were in town for the tribecca film festival and when we arrived we were greeted by a very good mix of music that ranged from jack johnson to bo diddly to coldplay and world music and the video screen was playing paris texas and changed to donnie darko to 1940's superman cartoons who ever chooses the music and movies has great taste
well the food is always good, aswell as the waitstaff,,,,,,i wish the manager was more people orriented
least the bartender was great and made as feel comfy and made awesome drinks you must try the lychee martini and the mojito's yes the guy makes awesome mojito's
i went to the avenue A restaurant last week with my friends
i had my first sushi after i came to the ny
the food was awesome
they have a lot of special rolls
like red and white roll,spicy boy roll,spicy girl roll
they are all fantastic
My cousins took me to this place for my birthday two weeks ago as a suprise
We had great food there
I can't say that's the best japanese food what I've had, it's the best meal I've ever had
I loved the WHITE TUNA APP
Instead of traditional Japanese, get the good quality in a really cool atmosphere
There is a DJ and a disco ball in the restaurant making it a great place to hang
Went on a Sat night
Before 8 they have early bird specials, 2 rolls, soup and salad and ice cream for $8
Also 2 for 1 drinks at the bar (funny bartender) and really good Merlot
My group had so much fun, ate well and left with money to go out afterwards
Great!
My friends and I had a horrible experience here
Not only did we wait for a half hour for a table (even though we had made reservations), it took an hour to get our food
After having waited so long, they brought the wrong order to my friend and when he asked for the right one it took another half hour
When we complained to the manager he was extremely rude and defensive
The sushi is fine but definitely not worth an hour and half wait
My friend took me here and I went back three times afterwards! It is such a good place
They have a live D
J
and the Sushi is so good and fresh
The sake is great! Everything is just so good
I love this place
They have cool artwork on the walls of local artists and it's just a great experience altogether! The price is decent too!
If you like a kitschy atmosphere where you can get average sushi, this is IT
Sushi here is average, though the dragon roll is tasty
In my experience, any Japanese restaurant that uses Chinese chefs to prepare sushi can never pull it off
Freshness of fish and skill of execution are just not there
But if you like a cool place to bring out of towners, they'll like the club-like though noisy atmosphere
This is a fun place to enjoy a great meal while at the same time listening to hot live djed mixes
The atmosphere is unlike any other Japanese restaurant you have been to
Instead of an expected traditional atmosphere you are welcomed by a funky decor and mini art gallery
It is a great place to bring people who love to have fun and just let their hair down
Try it you won't be sorry, before you know it you will be a fan
Avenue is by far the best sushi in Manhattan(a bold statement some may say but true)
I have been there at least 30 times and have never once had a not so fresh piece of fish
The decor is always updated
It is the perfect place for 20-30 something people looking for a great meal without breaking the bank
I've been to a great deal of Manhattan sushi joints and I've spent ridiculous amounts of money on sushi, but almost always I end up thinking to myself I should have just gone to Avenue A
This is my favorite sushi restaurant in the city (followed closely by Sushi Samba 7)
The food is surprisingly good AND cheap ($13 Sushi Deluxe!)
The decor is wonderful, always having new art by local artists
On the weekends they have a DJ, and the whole place is lit up with blacklight
While the service doesn't always smile, they are prompt and relatively friendly
The bar makes the best long island iced teas in manhattan, and they also have a huge saki and beer list
The perfect place to drunkenly stumble into for a bite at 2am
This was a dissappointing experience
I found the attempt at a kitsche decor was simply outdated
Also there was a bad smell about the place which is particularly acute in a sushi restaurant
The sushi was ok but there's much better in the east village
The erratic service was almost an afterthought
Everyone's always raving about this place, but frankly the sushi was nothing exceptional
I'm no sushi expert but freshness is a big factor in good sushi, and maybe just the day I went, it really was nothing special
I've been going to Ave A for over a decade
It hasn't changed a bit this whole time, and that's a good thing
The items on the traditional sushi menu are always fresh and well prepared

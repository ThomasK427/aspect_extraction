Service was very polite and pleasant and the fried banana with ice cream we got for desert was very tasty but still not good enough to make me come back to the restaurant for more
I went there a few times and I really like it
the food is great but the desserts are even better
you really gotta try the fry ice cream
you'll like it :)
Service is very attentive and friendly
Food is creative and delicious at moderate prices
Seating is comfortable and quick
I would definately go there again and again
Passed by this place located in the midst of the honkytonk Bleecker St
area and noticed the interesting dishes patrons were served at the streetside tables
Normally I'm leery of the restaurants in this area due to their touristy nature, but decided to go in anyway and boy was I very pleasantly surprised! The dishes are a little lighter than most Thai restaurants and the ingredients are very fresh
There are also some innovative and tasty new dishes that you won't find at traditional Thai restaurants
The staff is very friendly and the prices very inexpensive
All in all a very worthy destination
Chef Boyd is very creative in his Thai dishes made from the fresh vegetables that he purchase the same day
I've tried so many of his dishes and I like them all
His desserts are also excellent
I can eat Boyd's dishes every day
Chef Boyd and lovely girflfriend Nui who doubles as a waitress are both very friendly with honest and lovely welcoming smile
I get good energy dining at Boyd's
Tiny homey BYOB near NYU shining w/ flavorful, but ever changing Thai fusion dishes amazing desserts
Start with a Yum (salad) then dig into seafood or land dishes ( I personally like the duck or Seafood combo w/ Tuna/Salmon/shrimp)The atmos is clean and modern
The staff is prompt and amiable
It's located in a competitive location
Try the Creme Brulee flavored w/ Thai Ice Tea, ginger, or green tea, the fried ice cream, or the fried honey banana w/ homemade coconut icecream
We stumbled on Boyd's tonight while wandering around the McDougal/Bleecker area, and what a find! The food was delicious and we couldn't believe the prices
The coconut shrimp w/ avacado and pineapple salad was to die for, and the duck with penang curry special was tasty and plentiful for its $9
50 price tag
The menu is somewhat small, but everything on it sounds wonderful
We'll definitely be back
I've passed by The Alamo many times and finally decided to give it a try
What a suprise
The modern Mexican food really hit the spot
The asmosphere was fun and casual, the margaritas were teriffic and the service was attentive
I ate at the bar, but could see that the dining room was really happening
The warm lamb taquitos wer great!!!!
I'll be back soon
A few friends and I thought Alamo would be an ideal spot to celebrate Cinco de Mayo - however, we were mistaken
The bar was crowded as expected, but there was only one bartender, and she was either extremely rude or blind
Even though we managed to get a spot right on the bar, she ignored us at least 3 times
Instead she joked with the patrons next to us who had full glasses of margaritas
The fact that a Tex-Mex bar had only one bartender working on Cinco de Mayo is an indication that Alamo still lacks good management
The fact that the bartender was rude means that I will NEVER enter that bar again
Definitely don't miss out on Alamo
The original restaurant closed down after a long run, changed to Ola, and then reopened new and improved as the Alamo, again
The inside is gorgeous
chic with a sleek bar and comfortable lounge
The restaurant section is beautiful
dimly lit with sophisticated color and design
Truly impressed with the new interior
The food, service and drinks are phenomenal
For those of you in the midtown area
definitely don't miss this gem
It will impress you and anyone you bring
I must say I was completely shocked to read the older reviews for this restaurant from 2005
Whatever happened in the past year I can safely say that Alto has fixed it all
I ordered off the restaurant week menu (which they are retaining for the rest of the summer) and was shocked at what I received for my money
The homemade spaghetti may not seem like much of a dish on the menu, but the pasta was cooked perfectly and the slightest hint of red pepper gave the sauce a wonderful kick
The chocolate ganache for dessert was also wonderful, and a generous portion for a restaurant week menu
The other members of my party ordered off the regular menu and were equally pleased with their dishes
My friend specifically commented on the freshness of the fish he ordered
The staff was beyond attentive and helpful
I cannot wait to come back here!
I have been to this restaurant several times
It is near my office
I have found that it is perhaps the only Italian in New York or The US
that truly represents the food of Italy's North
The service is nothing but gracious and attentive, the food is always ALWAYS inspired, fresh and interesting but not off putting
It really does match the great restaurants of Italy
Also, the wine list so think and vast
It is just a find
Also the private rooms are very nice
Too good to identify by Italian standards
It is far ahead of the pack
Why is this restaurant participating in restaurant week? 4 at lunchwith 1:45 pm late reservationsonly to be seated in a far corner of an empty dinning room--to be virtually ignored The expected restaurant week entrees, chicken, pasta, and salmon but the appetizers were at a new low -- a beet and goat cheese salad that tasted looked fresh from Gristedes, (the goat cheese reminded us of synthetic cream cheese) slivers of scallops that had know better days and a mushroom polenta that was like baby food with presentations close to a coffee shop--rabbit pasta was salty and tasteless and the salmon dry--the desserts were similarly uninspired--portions were minisicule --the bread, pretzels rolls and potatoe and onion, with a good olive oil they obviously give real customers was the best part of a really bad meal that shows obvious contempt for customers and restaurant week
The sommelier was surpiringly rude, considering the rest of the staff was delightful
We found it odd that they don't open the bottle of wine at your table
Instead, they show you the bottle unopened, take it to the back, and open it in private, and allegedly taste it first as well
When we asked the sommelier about it, he was not only defensive, but arrogant and rude in his response
and almost refused to open the bottle at the table until we insisted
He was very unprofessional and very unbusinesslike
I loved this restaraunt but i most likely will never go back there because of the way he treated our party
Having dined in many of New Yorks Italian restaurants I must say the creative approach to Scott Conants Alto is a breath of fresh air to an otherwise mundane level of Italian cusine throughout the city
There are no meatballs and Lasagne here, there was actual thinking behind the menu
Our server Michealango was outstanding and made us feel very comfortable we had a great time
Next time we come to New York we will definatley be back can't wait
This is the first time I've been moved to add a review to a restaurant, I am so unhappy with the treatment we received
I took 4 work colleagues for lunch, we took the 'expresso' menu
It took over an hour and a half to receive appetiser, main and coffee (20 minute wait just to get cappucinos)
Despite the fact that we were all in business attire, we were seated away in a corner, and it was very difficult to get service - even though the restaurant did not appear to be busy
Servings were small, acceptable quality, but should have not taken so long to considering they were on a prix fix
I just hope the reason that we got such bad service was not because my four work colleagues were indian and chinese
Had high hopes for this Conant venue
Service is over-attentive and forbearing
Menu sounds creative but often misses the mark
It seems that the staff have not eaten many of the items they are recommending
Just felt like details were missing or a lack of and enthusiastic endorsement
This atmosphere may work for some but came off as sterile to our group
The whole fish was excellent--not overcooked and served in a light tomato broth

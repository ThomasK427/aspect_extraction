While the atmosphere is charming and the service gracious, it is the food that draws us back
The French onion soup is the best in the US (and France), but don't overlook the butternut squash/crayfish and mushroom/roasted garlic soups
Once you sample the crab cakes, you will be disappointed with them anywhere else
The fava bean salad with smoked gouda, walnuts and chive olive oil can't be beat
Plenty of other tasty salads to choose from
My husband rarely tears himself away from the roasted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes
The steak frites is a classic
The fish selections are always fresh
The attention paid to each plate that leaves the kitchen is clear
The chef has a wonderful sense of favor which is reflected throughout the menu
Le Gigot is a favorite of ours!
Le Gigot has become my favorite New York restaurant
The food is consistently excellent, the ambience is perfect and the price range for the quality that you get makes it one of the best values
The crab cakes are the best Ive had anywhere and are no doubt made with the highest quality fresh crab meat and no bread filler The soups are always exceptional and the salads are delicious
They make a light salad dressing which I believe is made with some sort of fig reduction which is outstanding
The meat dishes are equally exceptional
Be sure to try it for lunch or brunch too
The eggs benedict are the best in NY
And the pre-fix brunch prices make it one of the best deals around
Just go, you will love it
I come back to this place every few months for the last 4 years and I've never had a bad experience
The food is always exquisite and unlike the usual french fare, it is never too greasy or heavy
The service is wonderful, the place itself is cozy and romantic without being cheesy
Best dish I've tried there yet is the Lobster Risotto
Oh, and the lunches there are great
especially Salad Nicoise!
Le Gigot made me feel like I had stumbled into some magical back alley of Montparnasse where everyone speaks English
The receptionist greeted us as if we were old friends, and the unpretentious little dining room put my date at ease after a stressful week
Service was impeccable, but the waiter had trouble keeping our wineglasses from running out
The small winelist has bottles in the $40 range
I recommend the flambe desert (which of course the waiter lights on fire on the table)
Make a reservation and bring cash (no Visa/MC)
This small cafe has a very cute bathroom, but it's positives end there
The service sucked--we didn't get bread, our eggs were cold, and their brunch prix fix does not include an alcoholic drink
On top of that, they charged us more for our glasses of champagne and mimosas than what was marked on the menu
Since we were a group of 5, they automatically added 18% gratuity
Thirty bucks for cold eggs and a mimosa--give me a break!
Le Gigot is a great restaurant to take a date
It's small and romantic plus the service and food are wonderful!
My boyfriend brought me to Le Gigot for my birthday, and I fell in love with this charming and romantic little French restaurant immediately! The space is intimate and tiny, the ambience quiet and romantic, and the food delightful
My boyfriend's duck was unforgettable and my salmon was light but savory
We sat close together at a small table and had one of the most romantic evenings we've ever had in New York!
Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here on Saturday night
The food was superb, the atmosphere was warm and romantic and the service was perfect
I highly recommend Le Gigot and will go back in the future
Promt seating was the only good thing about this place
From splashing water over me, to forgetting to put a candle into my wife's birthday dessert (although I specifically called and reminded them couple of times), it was not a pleasant 'special occasion' experience at all
At to top it all, the food was just OK
For an expensive restaurant like this, this is unforgivable
We just happened to be in the village looking for somewhere to go when we found this lovely place
Authentic French food in a delightful (if cramped) space
Service was attentive and the food was fabulous
Prices were a bit high but this is NYC
Le Gigot is definitely meant to be a date spot, not a place for big groups
The tables are very close together and small to begin with
So small in fact that my girlfriend set her menu on fire as she tried to read it because of a candle on the table
Sacre bleu!
While looking for a restaurant venue for my friends birthday I stumbled upon Le Gigot (with location cuisine in mind)
With party of six we were seated comfortably in the quaint resaurant
The service and attention was flawless
I ordered the crab cake special which was mouthwatering to perfection (probably the best main dish that night)
Everybody loved the cosy atmosphere and cuisine
I would recommend this restaurant if you want somewhere a little quieter and romantic
It wasn't crowded when we went so not sure if things would be the same on any other night
My husband and I had 8:00 reservations but weren't seated until 8:45
We had to sit on the window seat akwardly squished between the pile of coats and the couple seated at the bar
Things did improve however
We found the wine list to be affordable and compatible with what was on the menu
We started out with the homemade pate which was great
The salad with apples was delicious as well
My husband had the bouliabasse which had generous portions of seafood, but the broth was a tad bit overpowering
I had the leg of lamb served with beans and roasted garlic
It was done to perfection and I absolutely loved it! The service was very attentive as well
I would definitely return
Everything about this place is charming - and the whole package makes for a wonderful dining experience
If I was forced to find fault then it's the lack of French Apertifs in the bar, but I think that can slide
We went here for Valentine's day, and the place was just perfect
Its a very small restaurant, but very cute and romantic
The service was perfect
I was even more impressed when a previous diner from the evening called in to report she had lost her watch, and the owner extensively looked for it for her
The food was really tastey as well
We were so happy with our experience there
I should warn though that the prices are as high as you might expect to find in a larger, more well-known place
But its worth it
I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we were both very impressed by the atmosphere and the food
Authentic French Cuisine at reasonable prices with a friendly staff
The only downside is that the tables are very close together and you can only pay with AmEx or cash
All in all, a great experience
I wanted to try somewhere new with an out-of-town visitor
The food came out almost immediately, giving us the (correct) impression they wanted us out of there fast
The food was okay, but not outstanding for the price
After only being there a total of 45 minutes, the check came
Five minutes later we were asked (nicely) if we could leave our table b/c the next table was waiting
Ours wasn't a small bill
They offered free glasses of champagne at the bar, which we took because we were still in shock
The manager came over later and was very nice and apologetic about it, seemingly not knowing what had happened in the dining room
But it was a little too late
I will stick to my tried and true, Le Tableau
Le Gigot was quite a surprise
We wanted to go to Po, Mario Batali's restuarant up the street but we arrived 10 minutes before their service started and were told we couldn't wait at the bar

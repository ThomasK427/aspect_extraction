Way too sketchy
The owners probably put up their own high ratings
I never would have thought of coming here, but when a friend brought me I was really pleased
The deliciously seasoned beef and rice dish is what I remember best
Steer clear of the fish and you'll be alright
Diner food, nothing out of this world
Understaffed, so if it's crowded, prepare to be forgotten about
This cozy little spot gives the lie to anyone who thinks the French are uniformly unfriendly
From the quaint decor to the pleasant servers, it's a congenial experience even before the food arrives
And the delicious French country fare, carefully prepared and lovingly served, does nothing to dispel the sense that you're enjoying hospitality rather than just buying a meal
Surprisingly secluded given its midtown loation, Bienvenue offers a welcome haven from the city's stressed-out pace
Nothing about this restaurant was pleasant
This is coming from someone who is relatively easy to please
The food was bland and the service was horrendous
At one point, I spilled my water glass--when I informed the waiter of this he said he would clean it up--he never got around to it
We ended up cleaning the water up ourselves
My boyfriend and I couldn't figure out how this place could stay in business
It was, by far, the worst dining experience ever!!! We would have had a better time at home, eating a microwaved veggie burger! Save yourself--STAY AWAY!!!
There needs to be a big sign that says: Vegan / Kosher in front of the restaurant because there wasn't one when I wen tthere
I'm no stranger to vegetarian Indian food, but the food here on this day wasn't what I expected much less enjoyed
The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant
As a major Indian cuisine surveyor, I can recommend more than a handful of places that exceed Madras Mahal in many more ways than I can count
Definately the best out of all the other indian casual dinning restaurant
it has great selection of the menu including north, west , and south indian cuisine
good service and great value
Must try their Weekend Specials
Mind Blowing new items
For the money, you can't beat this please
The dishes are well presented; prepared with a little flare
Often, I find that Indian restaruants tend to over-cook their food, but not Madras Mahal
The portions were generous, and while the prices were very reasonable, the decor was not no-frills in the least
The added bonus is Madras Mahal adheres to strick kosher guidelines, something they accomplish without compromising their menu since it's a vegetarian restaurant
Yet, on the evening I had dinner there with several friends, the patrons were diverse
Whether you're kosher or not, I think you'll like the food here and it won't put a major dent in your wallet
I saw this Restaurant on Fox 5 the other morning and i thought of giving a visit
they got some are great vegetarian food
service is good
the owners are usually there and they are very kind people
must try their dosas
curies are nice and made to your spice level
They deliver as well
Also things you do wanna keep in mind that there's a special menu on weekend as weekend special
22 dosas are really cool on the table when you have a party to ammuse
overall great dinning experience
tasty food
I would for sure recommend this one to anyone who likes Indian food
It was amazing
Go and Enjoy and rate it yourself, don't take my word for it! This is the first time I'm writing a restaurant review because I was so impressed by their food!
TRY THE CHANA SAG - EXCEPTIONAL
SPICES ARE BALANCED SO YOU ARE NOT OVERWHELMED BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER MEALS
weekends are the time to go when the menu expands - the dosa, vara and iddly combos are fantastic
if only the service could be a little more friendly
If you've never had South-Indian food, or if you are already a South-Indian food lover, head straight here
Take it from a Madras-born Indian girl
Wherever I go, I order a Rava Dosa which is best-described as a crispy Indian crepe (made with cream of wheat, so a bit of crispy texture and very tasty!)
Here I ordered the Mysore Rava Masala Dosa -spicy and filled with a scrumptious potato filling
The dipping sauces, sambar and coconut chutney, were better than most South-Indian restaurants
It's hard to beat home-cooked!
Decor/space here is fine, but the food is consistently excellent! To start, try the 'Kuchumber' for an unique salad, as well as their crispy, fresh samosas
The dosas here are delicious (and huge!, so small-eaters be warned!) esp
their 'onion rava' dosa
They also serve a delicious buttery 'badam halwa' to finish on a sweet note
The service can sometimes be rushed, but they truly work hard, and are always willing to accomodate you (our party was able to get a specially requested spiced chai not on the menu!)
This little italian hideout is amazing
The food was delicious and perfectly portioned
The service was exceptional, they were attentive without being overbearing
I had the lobster ravioli (a special for the night) and my friend had the gnocchi, both were amazing
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great italian food!
I went here on a double date and it was perfect
Cozy atmosphere, but you don't feel cramped
Food was yummy and the service was great
We asked the waiter for a wine recommendation, and he actually recommended the most inexpensive one which turned out to be exactly what we were looking for
Can't get honest service like that anywhere
And, we even got a complimentary tirimisu at the end! We're definitely going back!
My Husband and I visit this resteraunt every Valentines Day for the past 4 years
They have a spectacular pre-fixed menu for the evening, with more food then a wedding! The owner/maiter 'D/sometimes chef is the sweetest Italian man
The atmosphere is very charming
Prices are great and food is very good
We can not forget the Red Rose they give to the ladies on Valentines Day
All year round this place is a hidden treasure in Murray Hill
I came here because it looked like a charming place, and it had received some good reviews
Unfortunately, I left without being particularly satisfied
The host was certainly friendly enough, and judging from the entrance of other diners, there seemed to be many happy regulars
As for myself, I found the atmosphere cute, although for a quiet evening, being on Lexington Avenue may not be the best idea
The food was standard, and not amazing
As for the service, the staff is friendly, but my water glass was refilled only once, and then left empty for 45 minutes, and not refilled again
The place wasn't crowded, so I really can't understand this
As I looked at some of the regulars having a good time, I did consider giving this place a second chance; however, with so many wonderful restaurants in New York City, it is just not worth it
A colleague took me to her favorite little Italian restaurant and made me an instant convert
The menu is amazing but their specials are inspired
Their attention to quality and detail will make this your favorite place before you've finished your first course
They have a garden and I am just waiting for cool summer nights to take advantage of it
As a native NY-er take it from me, a better staff or dining experience you will not find in NYC
This place has great service, unbelievable food and is a good find
Although it is usually half empty, the food is great
try the Penne Grossetanta
mmm
A great date place
romantic and reasonable !
This is one of our neighborhood favorites

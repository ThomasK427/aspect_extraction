Definitly recommended, the prices were right on the money
Very lively atmosphere
The walls could use a little paint, and the lights could be dimmed a bit but the food made up for it all
Have fun!
I've been living in Prospect Heights for over a year now and just checked out Geido
I can't believe what I've been missing out on
The place is beautiful, the food is excellent, and the prices are great! This is definitely going to be a weekly thing!
I go here almost weekly with a few of my friends
This place is terrific
I always leave happy, full, and not too poor either
The food is fresh, the sake is hot, and the atmosphere is boisterous
Groups of larger than 4 definitely have trouble getting in quickly, but 2 are almost always easily seated at the sushi bar
Hey all
I like everything about this place
It's nice and casual
sushi is pretty good too
the only thing that struck me as odd is that they served my sashimi with a bowl of unseasoned hot rice
i dunno if that's the way it's done
but
i have never come across something like that
anyway, other than that
this place is pretty good
i'd go back
despite the hot rice
While the sushi isn't the melt-in-your-mouth type, it is very good nonetheless
I've been to Geido many times now and have enjoyed most of my experiences
My single unpleasant experience was when I went with a large group (6 ppl) on a Friday night -- we were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but it ended up being 50 minutes
I would say 8-10 parties of two's that came after us all got seated before us
If the restaurant had held some of the tables for two and combined them, we could've been accomodated much sooner
So the moral is, if you're a party of two, go anytime -- you won't wait more than 15-20 minutes
If you're a large party on a popular night, give yourself extra time or go somewhere else
You may ask why I didn't make reservations -- I tried, but Geido doesn't take reservations
Man, Geido rocks
I lived in Tokyo for cryin' out loud
This place is the best damned sushi in the entire stinkin city
Does anyone out there know if they're open on Mondays, because I'm getting a-hankerin' just writing this review? Must
have
the sushi
must
have
it
now
It's all good here at Geido
The restaurant has been in the neighborhood for 15 years and it still packs in the diners
Geido is mostly about sushi, and chef Osamu prepares classic and nouveau sushi expertly
The ingredients are always super fresh
If you feel like food from the kitchen, the okonomiyake are excellent here and so is the grilled eel
Our friends joke that Geido is our kitchen away from home
They are right, we have eaten here a couple of hundred times in the past 8 or so years
The quality here is never compormised, the fish is always perfectly fresh, the menu is diverse and the staff is wonderful
Not in the mood for sushi, try the fantastic okonomiyake
I've never NOT walked out of Geido full and happy! And my wallet doesn't feel like it was sucked dry
If you like spicy tuna, you'll love Geido's
Creamy texture, not incredibly hot but nicely seasoned and with scallions
a big heap of it is in the excellent in the very affordable and delicious Chirashi, which my boyfriend almost always gets
The prices are very reasonable
Geido's laid-back atmosphere makes it great for families and for a casual date
You know it's great because everyone seems to be a regular
In Short A dark, narrow takeout area gives way to small tables in a cozy space decorated to resemble a Bedouin tent
When weather permits, the umbrella-covered garden tables are perfect spots for sampling Middle Eastern salad platters heaped with hummus and stuffed grape leaves
Pitzas--pita pizzas topped with falafel, grilled chicken, roasted lamb, spicy lamb sausage and even shrimp and scallops--are as popular as the marinated and beautifully grilled chicken kebabs
Hands down this place has the best falafel sandwich in NY
Get the sandwich, not the platter as it is a better value for your $$$
The pitzas are outstanding and the baklawa is the best in all of Brooklyn (it makes your eyes roll into the back of your head)
The pita bread is made fresh to order everyone in my household are addicted to it
A must to try--you'll be here often
Bonus: you can bring your own beer!
I live in the area and was very surprised by the negative review given to this lovely little restaurant
The lambijin is amazing, as is everything else I've had here
When we have company it's one of our favorites to have for dinner, to share all of the pitzas, hummus, etc
I'm getting hungry just thinking of it!
The food I ordered from Bedouin Tent was poor in just about every way
the dolmas (grape leaves) were dry, the tabouleh was tasteless except for the giant chunks of spring onions, and the leg of lamb had such a pungent gamey odor that I had a hard time eating it
I've never had a middle eastern meal that I didn't want to finish
this was the first
Bedouin Tent is one of the best places to eat in this neighborhood
The service is wonderful, and the food speaks for itself
The falafel sandwich is huge and delicious and the pitzas are amazing
The lentil soup is delicious
They are fast to deliver and very nice people
I thoroughly reccomend this establishment to anyone
yesterday i went to moustache pitza it was far better than we expected
we were led to a back patio area filled with beautiful plants covered with embroidered tapestries
the staff was very friendly the service was good
we ordered the dolmas as an appetizer they were the best ones i've ever had
we were also very happy with our entrees the rice pudding tasted so fresh not too sweet
we would definitely go back to this place, the prices are great too
the only negative thing that i could say is that they brought a pita bread on a paper plate the rice pudding in a plastic container
other than that, everything was wonderful
Our waiter took ages to take our order, he forgot about us and disappeared for 40 minutes to go hang out in the kitchen
Even he popped up, saw us glaring at him and realized that he hadn't given us any food
We had to bother managers and other waiters several times to get a serviced and get a check
One of the clumsy waiters spilled food all over my boyfriend, it was just horrible IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE
Definitely not worth it
Worst 2 hours of my life!
This restaurant was said to be pretty good, so i went to try it with my bf
it was very nice looking, but the wait service was slow and they definitely lost interest after we didnt order their expensive wines
I ordered veal, and my bf had pasta
His pasta was soft and mushy, with sauce that tasted like cans
My veal was dry, and tough (can you even get that from veal!?) and the complimentary pasta that came with my dish was just plain nasty

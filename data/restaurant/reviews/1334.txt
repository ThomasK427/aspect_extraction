Very fresh fish like the toro that melt in your mouth, the white tuna or their specialty rolls like the The Park Avenue and The Flavia Roll
The sakes selection is small but affordable, great beer selection and good wines by the glass
Overall the sushi is worth every penny
I discover Paris Match on citysearchnyc
com
We checked the place last night for the first time and really enjoyed the experience
Great food (bistro food is cheap
the sushi excellent but expensive), really good desserts, beautiful bartender and pretty good service
wow! Everyone keeps speaking about this new restaurant Paris Match
So I figured I would finally go and try it out
Starting off with an excellent carafe of Cotes du rhone suggested by the waiter, we soon ordered a few appetizers like the steak tartare, the escargot and the goat cheese tart
I the ordered some sushi like the toro (absolutely unreel but expensive) the fresh salmon and the white tune as well as a couple rolls like the eel and avocado and the Park avenue roll (big and fantastic) If you love chocolate try the warm chocolate souffle as wellas the tart tatin
Overall the experience was great but loud and happening, not for the intimate experience
The food was great food, the service amazing a bit surprising those days in manhattan
We had their specialty rolls that were excellent especially The Paris Match roll and The Park Avenue Roll
For desserts we had the crepes with nutella and the chocolate souffle
simply amazing
The only bad thing is that we had to wait 20 minutes with a reservation
Forget those stuffy french places on Madison avenue
Paris Match is the new Madison destination
from the beautiful decor, friendly and informative staff to the wonderful food and energetic vibe
this place has it all
Absolutely the best sushi I've ever eaten
My boyfriend and I had our first date here and we come back regularly for drinks, dinner and brunch
we always love the experience and are always satisified and impressed
!!! Very Highly Recommended !!!
This spot is a hit compare to all the restaurants around in that area
The atmosphere is fun, the service efficient, the food excellent and the prices reasonable
Try their top quality sushi at reasonable price as well as the paris match steak and amazing fries for $18
Inviting, fun bistro on Madison
The food is outstanding, the service friendly and the price decent for such a hot spot
Great appetizers selection and fantastic cheese plate
We went to Paris Match with 3 people and enjoyed our lunch
Killer sushi and great price fixed lunch
The service was good and friendly
Great hot spot for rich woman watching
We joined some friends last night and the atmosphere at this cool bistro reminded it us of Pastis but with much better food
The onion soup, the escargot, the steak for $18 was perfect but the draw there are the sushi
Phenomenal quality of toro and inventive rolls like the park avenue and the paris match rolls
The desserts are also great and fairly price
I was told to check Paris Match for the cool vibe and the food but we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated
Great appetizers like the fried calamari (very fresh and crispy, the white eggplant dipping sauce is delicious), tuna tartare (the best I have ever had), great steak fries and excellent half free ranging chicken
We didn't try the sushi despite seeing it on every tables
Despite the appealing location and cozy bistro ambiance, the food is simply a joke
My husband's crab cake appetizer (for about $13) looked like a McDonald's filet-o-fish sandwich and tasted even worse
It was obviously mass-produced and came right out of the freezer
The only good part about his steak frites were the frites
My French onion soup, however, was excellent--especially when compared to the rest of our food
My chicken paillard turned out to be another let-down
We are very easy to please when it comes to food
The food at Paris Match was so horrible that all we could do was laugh! I have no idea what goes on it that kitchen, but I imagine I would have a good time watching
Great atmosphere, good food, great wine
Consistent bistro food and cute french waiters
The only drawback I found was that the prices were a little high
Menu highlights were a delicious chopped chicken salad and great steak
They also have sushi which was good, but expensive
Great for groups if you don't mind dropping a little dough
On a recent visit to New York City we were told to try 212
212 was so fantastic that we decided to try their sister restaurant Paris Match
It was superbe
Great good and great sushi
As for the crowd very chi-chi
with a lot of plastic surgery but I guess that what rich quartier in New York is all about
We stopped by over the week-end as we heard this new place had great sushi
We had a few toro and white tuna sashimi as well as a couple roll like the park avenue (which was not listed on the menu but recommended by the waiter) and the paris match roll
The staff is friendly and the restaurant looks like a small barthazar
My friend and I were rushed through our dinner
The main course came before we were done with the appetizer
Right after we finished the main course (the organic chicken was dry), but before we finish drinking the wine the check was placed on the table, and the waitress came back and picked it up three times
Finally another waiter (or host) came and asked us to take our wine, and move to the bar
He did offer to buy as dessert, but we felt so humiliated that we left
We spent $120, and were there only 2 hours
This had never happened to me at any other restaurant, and being in the entertainment business I go out a lot
The ambiance is nice, the food is decent, but not great
I sat at a table right near the bar, the chair was so big that everytime someone walked by they kicked my chair(accidentally), so that got annoying
I had the organic chicken, which was a bit dry
They gave us a sample of a few different olive oils which was nice
Service was good
They let us stay there for a few hours without any hassles
Overall, ok
Great addition to this gastonomic wasteland
feels like Downtown
However, there's no place to leave your coat, except to sit on it
Don't go lunchtime--it's hectic, over-crowded extremely noisy! The crostini is incredible, the carpaccio is, too; the lamb main dish is excellent
Fig Olive is a charming neighborhood restaurant - something much needed on the Upper East Side
The food is delicious, healthy and simple
Try the sample of crostinis and the salads
I am en event planner and made reservations for a business luncheon at Noon for 5 business associates
I called to confirm the reservations on the morning of the lunch and the hostess had the reservations set for 12:30pm which I quickly corrected
When the group arrived for the Noon lunch the restaurant was only partially set up and the group was forced to eat lunch while the staff noisily set up the restaurant around them
Not very professional
My friend and I wanted to find a nice restaurant to catch up on things
She did a search, and found this place
When we first walked in, it was such a wonderful atmosphere
The lighting, the decor, everything about it was just beautiful
Service was fantastic! The servers were very attentive, polite, and always willing to answer our questions
The food and drinks were excellent!! The only thing is that this restaurant is pretty pricey, but I think the dinner experience here is worth it
We were two couples from Montral visiting NY for Easter weekend
I was determined to find the perfect NY restaurant for our Saturday night
I spent countless hours sifting through restaurants on Citysearch

So's the tiramasu
The rum balls melt in your mouth
And the cookies with the pine nuts can't be beat
Go to Lombardi's for pizza and Ferrara's for dessert and you won't be disappointed
I hear Ferrara's has opened a branch on Broadway but haven't tried it yet
If it's as good as the original, it will be a real treat
The orginal owners must be turing over in their respective graves
THe service and staff was simply terrible!! The pastries tasted like they had been in the showcase for trwo weeks and the coffee was the last straw, it tasted a little better than it smelled
We did however find a delicious bakery off of Canal st and Mulberry the next called La Bellla Ferrera, no relation and it was La Bella
The staff was friendly and service was great
The cakes and dessert was unreal, probably the best I have ever had
I spoke with the owner and told him to sell his stuff to Ferrerra the might do better, he laughed but didn't have anything bad to say about them, I sure do and La bella prices were even better
This place is one of my favorite Restaurants
The service is good
The food is phenomenal
Not all the dishes taste like meat but they still taste very good
And in the end
The taste is what counts
The lighting is dim and it might not be the best atmosphere but its nice and cozy
Get the Steak, get the Ham Fried Rice, Get the Braised Fish, Get anything Pork and Ham, Appetizers are good too
All in all this place is very enjoyable
Excellent food
The food is very tasty and the service is usually very friendly
Worth the trip
This restaurant is entirely vegetarian, everything is mock meat/seafood
To date, after trying most things on the menu, I have never been disappointed
I no longer live in NYC, but every time I am in town, I make it a point to eat there
And I always fly home with several take out containers of the Hot Steak Kew
It freezes great and I can enjoy this wonderful dish when I am back home
If you are vegan or vegetarian YOU HAVE to try this wonderful restaurant
it will convert your non-veggie friends and family members
Mmmm
I had a bad first impression on this restaurant; not with the atmosphere or anything, but with the appetizer
I ordered a curry chicken and it was served in less than 2 minutes
As bad as the prep, the food tasted like the one from a can I once bought, only worse
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
Good thing though, my main course was good enough
I had one of the E-Fu noodles
Would recommend this one
House of Vegetarian is simply the best Chinese vegetarian place around
Forget Zen Palate and VP1 2
HOV's food is flavorful, not greasy, and clean tasting
I highly recommend the braised chicken with lily flowers
The best meal I've ever had
The meat substitutes are incredible
Everything's perfectly cooked, utterly delicious, and inexpensive, especially compared to most vegetarian places
I could eat there every day and never get sick of it
HUGE menu!
yeah, feels like you're in china
food hits the spot, love the english translations on the carts that go by
you are never rushed, unlike other dim sum spots that don't have enough seating
this place is a family favorite for dim sum
very, very consistent food, and decent staff (if you speak chinese they are more friendly, but they're used to having some american patrons, too)
bathrooms not super clean but what restaurant in chinatown has that?
Great place to get dim sum but don't expect much beyond that
It's cafeteria seating and avg at best decor and minimal service
Typical China town atmosphere but that's why you go there
A co-worker from Hong Kong brought me in for Dim Sum and I've been in love ever since
With its expansive dining room of the red lacquer and golden dragon, it may look like a wedding banquet gone amuck or a setting in a John Woo movie
But amidst the bustling veneer are the harmonious affordable little delights
Shark's Fin Dumpling, Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling), Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf and other steamy offerings should capture your heart
Bonus, are the name plates on the carts translated in English, so you know what's coming your way
Weekends may be hell to get in but once you're seated and the ladies with the trays roll by, it's nothing but heaven
This feels like a classic dim sum palace
Women with steaming trays of dim sum and no command of english
The food is good, people are nice, and I love being seated at a table full of Chinatown locals
Be prepared to wait on the weekends
One of the better bargains in NY for a meal of any kind
If you haven't eaten here before, you haven't tasted nothing yet
The traditional food tastes delicious
I love the Har Kow even though I'm not a big fan of shrimp
It's roomy, and very comfortable
Makes you feel like you're in China
been living in the neighborhood forever
went there about 15 years ago but don''t remember my experience so i decided to try it again
they''ve been around for so long and there must be a reason for it
i don''t know what that reason is
it must be some landmark by now, that''s why
i ordered pasta with fried scallops and you can tell that those scallops were just taken out from the freezer
the service wasn''t that great either
i guess you need to either look rich or look like someone from the sopranos
won''t go there again
We walked into Vincents and sat right down after walking past all the other little trendy italian eateries that had a line
This place was recommended to us by a local
Our server was old and a little slow but adorable
His support staff was excellent and right on top of everything
After trying to order ravioli and being told it wasn't real pasta, I went w/the server's suggestion of the rigatoni! It was awesome
You could taste the authenticity!
Whether its your cup of tea or not, this IS what a typical Italian restaurant was back in the day
No gimmicks, no fancy decor, no guy standing outside with menus shouting at you to come in
Just a simple, family owned place that focuses on one thing and one thing only - great traditional italian food
If you want a trendy spot, dont go here
If you want white glove service, dont go here
I came to New York way before 9/11 and I still recommend this place to anyone that visits New York
In fact, even though we live in Seattle, we still order their sauce every year for my aunt because it is the best Italian sauce in the nation!!!!
I was taken here by a local who swore by this place
I have to admit, it was the only place around that didn't require a reservation or had a huge wait
We came right in and sat down
As much I was excited about an authentic Italian restaurant, I was sadly disappointed
What kind of Italian restaurant doesn't have spaghetti on the menu??? The food was rather bland, nothing I couldn't make at home just as easily

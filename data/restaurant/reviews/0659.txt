The thinly sliced Salmon dish was also delicious
Comfortable setting, nice music, pleasant service and great food made for a great celebration for my wife's birthday
Upon walking in you feel like you just walked into Europe
Its Spain at its best
The owners are great and really on the ball
The wines are really good and you can choose from so many different kinds of wine
The space is great, really modern and the music is upbeat and new
As for the best thing about Azafran it's the food!!! The 30 plus different kinds of Tapas are so damm good
The meat w/stuffed pesto is a winner, so are all of the greens
I would reccomend this place to anyone who wants to get into a Barcelona,Spain frame of mind
Its a really great night out with great eat's and great wine
*Make reservations*
the food was delicious but the host/hostess kept trying to rush us out
i understand that it was a saturday night, and we were a big group, but still it was my birthday and i should be allowed to sit for 5 minutes wihtout being hurried out the door
food was great though- i'd recommend for small groups
The food and ambience were great, but the service was lacking
It would have helped if they had told us in advance that the dish our friend ordered would take an hour to make
We ate all our food and were ready to order desert before his appetizer even came out
Watch out for the hidden sharing charges they tack onto your bill
What a let down
The food was okay, but heavy on the salt
The service was the worst I've ever encountered in NYC
After being seated 1/2 hour after our reservation it took another 1/2 hour to take our order
Sangria was good but by the time the order for the second pitcher was placed they were out of red wine sangria
We drank our white wine sangria, AFTER dinner, with our complimentary sorry for bad service dessert
When the check came, they totally screwed up the credit card billing
After pointing out the error they still screwed up! The only thing good to come from the meal is that b/c of the incompetence, we were only charged for half the meal! I would NEVER go back here
Restaurants like this are a dime a dozen-the only thing that sets them apart is the service-which Azafran clearly doesn't have!
The food here is very very good! If you want spanish meditteranean dishes that are pretty close to your mothers cooking , this is the place to go
The ambiance is modern and tasteful
The service could use some improvement
Very catchy decor - No bar stools at the time - The manager promised they will be in shortly
Food was ok , but definatetly portions way too small
Wine list trying to pull it off only with Spanish wines is a little difficult
I would try it again, but would bring my own wine
Nice bar with wines displayed to bad the wines are only spanish
Very tasty--the dishes remind me of when I was in Spain
This is closer to authentic than any place I've been to in New York, and the atmosphere and layout are perfect
The choice on the menu is also unparalleled
Hoping to impress my 2 friends with my new find on Citysearch, I certainly had an apology to make afterwards! The service was slow and unattentive, the amount of food for the price was a joke, and further, the food was hardly edible! We ended up finding another restaurant when we left to finish dinner
Food so bland, the Spanish would blush
Choose another restaurant out of the thousands in the city before wasting your time with this disappointment!
Nice decor, subpar service, barely edible food, good sangria
Not worth the visit
Azafran is one of those restaurants which comes along only so often
A perfect melding of flavorful cuisine, fragrant wines warm ambience
The owners are a particular rare find, sparing no gesture in their effort to make sure everyone feels welcome
Some of the dishes were delicious and other were absolutely tasteless
Our waitress was rude and somewhat hostile
While the management was kind and aplogetic for our waitress's embarrasing behavior, I would not go back
There are so many better restaurants in this city
don't waste your time
Since I live in the area, I am a regular at Azafran
The place is stylish yet simple and avoids the cliches usually associated with Spanish restaurants in the city
The food is diverse and excellent, especially the different shrimp dishes
The owners are great - follow their advice on ordering
The wines are the best value in the city!
I have had only a few more disappointing experiences than my meal at Azafran
For no apparent reason, we were seated side by side next to the kitchen when the restaurant was a third full
The food was mediocre at best, and to add insult to injury was exorbitantly overpriced
I live 100 yards from Azafran but will never step foot in there again
We wanted Spanish downtown, checked out citysearch and came across Azafran
The paella was a perfect rendition of the dish that we had in Barcelona and the white sangria was delicious
The photography is cool and the open kitchen lets you see fast a chef needs to move
The champagne was nice too
A modern restaurant for tapas food
Overall experience was nice but a bit pricey
Some portions are big and some are small
I loved the fried calamari, the manchego cheese and the mussels! A big menu to choose from
I would recommend it
I lived in Spain for two years, and this was the best Spanish tapas experience I've had in NY so far
Tapas bars are often a bit dingy offering mediocre bar food at best - and never quite authentic
Azafran's atmosphere is great - modern, clean and minimalist and the food was outstanding - very authentic and delicious
I walked away saying it was the best meal I'd had in months
Definitely worth a try
The Scene Revival is a leader in the decades-old movement to gentrify Harlem
The Clinton-frequented restaurant stands handsomely on a quiet residential corner, and the modern interior includes a long dining room, a small bar and harsh lighting
Dance music plays loudly, while a soundless movie runs against the back wall
Expect cordial, attentive service and an eclectic menu
The Food This restaurant takes a swing at American cuisine
The kitchen excels with both its savory risotto heaped high with smoked duck and its roast duck breast, which arrives abundant and tender, although lacking a promised date sauce
Less successful are overcooked lobster and baby back ribs which are very sweet and a tad dried out
The best reason to dine here is the outstanding "twin mashed potatoes," a buttery-rich, creamy pairing of sweet and golden potatoes, delicately garnished with herbs
I had my husband's 30th birthday surprise party at Revival on 12/16/2005, and it was wonderful
The food and the drinks were excellent as was the service
The packages were flexible and could be easily customized
The lounge had great ambience and very chic furnishings
It was a wonderful party and I think our guests will be talking about it for a long time to come
Thanks Revival!!
excellent food
great atmosphere
friendly staff
home away from home check out the thursday evenings after work, great music
kareoke nights friday
2 for 1 drinks between 5 -7
The service here is poor because the wait staff is tipped 18% regardless of how attentive they are
My husband and I enjoyed the food but have not gone back because its relatively expensive and you get poor service
Not worth it
My family and I went to Revival for a celebration as a very large party and everything went off without a hitch!!! The lounge on the side is fantastic and the totally comfortable
The drinks were perfect (the bartender even made one up for me for my birthday!)

Get ready to be surprised by food that is different from anything else you can find in NYC
Very cozy restaurant, not too many tables
This is not a cheap restaurant but it is worth every $
We live in a world of lots of choices,,but Alfama is a secret place that is now known to many people,,,It takes some doing to make down to Hudson Street for us,,,but it is worth the trip every time
Authentic food, great service, and a warm feeling as soon as you enter
We have brought many friends here, and they all praise this wonderful find
Hope you have a chance to try it soon,,,,Maybe they will build one uptown too?
I had a wonderful experience at Alfama
It was an amazing atmosphere, amazing food, and amazing Fado performance (entertainment)
Incredibly romantic and great value, the finest Portuguese cuisine in Manhattan
Definitely highly recommended, I plan on going back as often as I can
Great place
Don't miss it,especially the unusual wines and regional Portugese foods
Alfama is unique: It is one of the only upscale Portuguese restaurants in the USA and the experience will be pleasing to all
The food and menu are extraordinary, offering selections of cuisine thats complex and completly indiginous to Portugal -- this is not the kind of menu you can easily re-create at home
Their wine list features all ranges of Portuguese wines from inexpensive to expensive spanning all regions of Portugal
The service is caring and attentive and their deserts are the final creshendo -- leaving a wonderful memory
Don't forget to ask for a bica -- the Portuguese version of an expresso served with aesthetics and style
Restaurant has enticing curb appeal when walking by, but the experience inside is disappointing
Cuisine consists of strange interpretations of Portuguese cuisine
Portions are substandard and seafood is not fresh
Service is slow to the point of extreme annoyance and interaction with staff can be very trying
However, if you're not here for the food, then the ambience is attractive with great live music and an extensive cocktail list, albeit with contrived -- and trademarked -- cocktail names that make it hard to quickly spot standard favorites
My wife and I stumbled upon Alfama by mistake, and were blown away by the place
The atmosphere is welcoming and romantic, the staff is helpful and extremely knowledgable, lacking any of the habitual West Village pretension
The wine menu is impressive, the cocktail list even more so, and the food is simply divine
The shrimp and papya salad is among the best appetizers we've had, and the entrees are all terrific
The port selection, offered almost as an afterthought, is well-worth considering
In short, an instant favorite of ours
I've been a few times and each and every time it's better than the last
I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys quality Portuguese food and the ambience is as close to Portugal as possible
especially the live music on Weds
nites
A treasure of a dining experience! Good-sized portions served on royal-size plates - on large tables: No playing checkers to fit plates; staff's attentive to that issue
Wine and food top-notch
Waiterstaff charming, helpful
Sommelier knowledgeable
There's a regional sampling menu, and you can choose to get an appropriate wine with every course
Absolutely delicious
I travel on business, and have hit many fine places; this one is outstanding
Brought a colleague who travels even more than I here for lunch Wednesday, and she raved too
(She's been critical of other places!) Had Portuguese food even in the then-Portoguese Macao, at a restaurant highly rated in guidebooks
Not even close to the quality of Alfama
I just wanted to congratulate Alfama
I would only think of going to Alfama for drinks and a bite to eat at the end of the night
Preferably if someone else is paying! The wine is very good, but overpriced and served in very small glasses
The atmosphere is elegant-but a little cold
The food is fine, but the portions are miniscule
Thank God for the basket of bread or we would have starved!   Someone at Alfama obviously cares about food and wine
But it's wrong to serve such nice food and then send your customers away wanting to go get a slice of pizza to fill their stomachs
My dinner at Alfama was fabulous from start to finish
We went on a Wed night and listened to the Fado music and had a relaxing and delicious meal
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I can't wait to get back
There are far too few Portuguese restaurants in Manhattan
After having dinner here one night, I wish there were others better then this place
I didn't hate it
After all, the staff were all welcoming and very friendly
The atmosphere was cozy and romantic
The food was another story
Everything we ordered was too salty (especially the sausage) and the fish wasn't that fresh tasting
The desert of a roasted pear drizzled in a raspberry sause was the only thing worth it
For the very high price you'll pay, it isn't worth it
One would be better off having a real home cooked Portuguese dinner at home
I wouldn't go back for the food
Maybe for a drink at the bar with a friend
Try the Azurrejo!But hey, to each his or her own
It's very simple - Alfama is an amazing restaurant
The food is fresh, authentic and delicious
The ambience is warm, romantic and inviting without a hint of pretense
The service, atmosphere and of course, food, was superb
If you are looking for something memorable, go to Alfama
It is important, as a concierge, to be confident in where I send guests to dinner
I have such confidence in Alfama and hope that more people discover what it has to offer
One of the best things about this restaurant besides the food is that they don't rush you at all
The food is cooked fresh for you so is the desert
A must try restaurant!
Went to Alfama with two friends this past weekend
lovely intimate atmosphere, delicious, fresh seafood, great wine list, we had a delightful time! Its definitely a little West Village gem
even better in that its only a few blocks from my apartment! I will definitely come back with a date
My wife and I honeymooned in Portugal and never forgot the delicious food
It was her birthday last week so I picked Alfama by chance
The food was excellent, the atmosphere romantic, the service impeccable
We've decided to make it our restaurant of choice for our anniversaries to come
PS-Please try the wines or ports
Great selection
Obrigado Alfama
I spent this past summer in Portugal and had the most amazing time
And what's really great is the fact that I discovered Alfama upon my return
I absolutely love the food (it's really, really authentic and the flavors take me immediately back to Lisbon
ahh
)
I'm not much of a drinker, but on occasion have enjoyed Alfama's cocktails -- they're so original and delicious
The staff couldn't be more polite and helpful
If you want a true taste of Portuguese cuisine and hospitality but can't get to Portugal right away, Alfama is THE place to go!
I've been here a few times, and this place is really one of my favorites in New York
The service is always friendly but not too intrusive, the setting is romantic, and the food is outstanding (and reasonably priced)
I can't recommend it enough
Romantic, good service, good food, good wine and excellent all over
Will visit again and again, when I am in town
I visited your restaurant a couple of weeks ago while visiting from CA and thoroughly enjoyed it

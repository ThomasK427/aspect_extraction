I think its fair to describe Lupas as upscale and the tab will lighten your wallet, but the value is solid
Yet despite the upscale label, I am impressed at just how remarkably un-snooty the restaurant is
The wait staff has always taken the time to actually discuss menu choices with me really getting input from me
I can hardly imagine I would have ever ordered a Pork Shin left to my own devices, but what a divine dish
If you can enjoy a rich dessert, the Spiced Dates with Mascarpone is pretty close to orgasmic
This is the one restaurant in NYC that I always make a point to visit when in town
What a great place
What a great use of local ingredients
Linguini with ramps
Incredible
Truffled radicchio out of this world
One bummer was that they were out of the special entree, so they came out and said that the chef was not satisfied with the quality of the dish
Translation, they ran out
We substituted with the pork saltimbocca, which was great, but not the special, Pork Arosta
Finished with the ricotta with honey
Absolutely fabulous
The kitchen also sent over the tartufo with complements
This dessert was so good I almost forgot about the Pork Arosta
Thanks for a great experience
Would come back over and over
The evening had a rough start since I kept seeing older (in their 50's) parties and 30-something professionals get seated first
Got very frustrated and felt like we were being discriminated against because of our age (my 2 friends and I probably look like we're in our mid-20's)
Waited for about an hour even though we were first told that once a party of 4 (who were already finishing dessert) left, we would get their table
Once we sat down, everything was great
The Pork Arista was enormous and delicious! The waiter was gracious and didn't seem offended when we didn't order any wine or dessert (1 of us was starting the South Beach Diet and the other 2 wanted to be supportive)
The manager did apologize for the wait as we left, which we appreciated
Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage Fennel
End of story
Unbelievable
The only complaint I have with this place was probably my own fault
I should have just drank the house red, instead I felt like a dirty martini on the rocks
They obviously care a lot more about the food then they do about drinks from the bar, and it shows
It was a great meal!
One of the best meals I've had in NYC, hands down
You must have the lamb sausage, it is phenomenal! The oxtail vaccinara was also very good and flavorful
For those who can't afford Babbo, Lupa is the perfect place to go
Appetizers are on average 9 or 10, entrees average about 17
We had a friendly and knowledgeable waiter, and just a great overall dining experience
Only thing is you better call 2 weeks or more before you wanna go
Okay, I hate trendy places
I put off going here
Hithertofore, I've henceforth been skooled based on past experiences that any cool places are useless
However we gave it a shot and found the Maitre d' accomodating and the service scientifically astute and pleasurable from water to espresso, oxtail to tartufo
Anyone who has a problem with this most friendly of places has a problem dining in public, period
I and my lady love it, no reservations about that, we'll come back, see you soon unless you're a philistine
went here w/ great expectations and was greatly disappointed; the food was good, not great and vastly overpriced- one salad, two pasta dishes, two demi-carafes of red wine- $100 (tax and tip); rediculous; orechiette came w/ so little brocoli rape that it did not have its characteristic flavor; and it is very very loud
I do not know where to begin on this restaurant
It was so wonderful and delicious! I had the hand rolled penne pasta with ragu! I could not eat it fast enough! The prices are great too! My dish was only $ 20 as well as my husband's
The appetizers are from $ 5 - $ 15
Can't beat that for authentic home cooking! You will feel as if Mario is cooking personally for you
The wait is long, but well worth it! I highly recommend this place!
Where do I begin? Perhaps the most OVERRATED place in the city
All my girl and I ever heard was that we had to go to Lupa
You must go the Lupa
Well, we went and here it goes
Ambience was ok
That's the end of the compliments
The waiter was a completely obnoxious yahoo
He thought he was the cat's meow and knew everything
I have an food allergy which he didn't seem to care about
When I asked him to leave off a side dish that I was allergic to, he replied, I'll think about it
Don't think! Do!! I can die from it, you failed actor! I think the chef was a member of the pepper of the month club because everything was overpeppered
Chicken Fra'Diavolo had no sauce, just pepper!!! Listen, girlfreinds
Forget about this place and walk to Tomoe for sushi
This clunker just isn't worth it
also went to Lupa after not being able to get into Babbo
great food, excellent wine list, knowledgable staff
our server knew the wine list and the menu in and out, which helped tremendously
highly recommended
We wnated to go to ultra-hot Babbo, but settled for one of Mario Batali's other restaurants
We were more than pleased with our experience
The atmosphere was very cozy, our waiter was top-notch, and the food was fantastic
My picky husband was worried about finding something to eat (the menu is small and selective), but loved his lamb
The wine list was full of affordable choices, and the waiter helped me pick a fanatstic red
The prices were more than reasonable for NYC
Went on Friday, sat at the bar around 8PM - restaurant itself was not particularly crowded which we found strange
Ricotta gnochi are OK - the sausage is delicious, but when isn't sausage? Bucatini with an amatriciana sauce was good, but not mind-numbing or anything
Pork shin with honey sauce was interesting, but the small piece of meat was wrapped in a larger piece of fat that was inedible
All in all, this place is good for a decent plate of pasta, some good wine and a fun time - depth of flavor of food is only OK though
Perhaps it was just an off night - but I've had better for the same price
I thought Babbo was great -- Lupa tops it
Very warm and cozy restaurant in the back room, very loud and fun in the front room
Great service
Waitress offered many suggestions on food and wine combinations
The eggplant parm appetizer is AMAZING --but (the portion is) definately TOO small!!! The Ricotta Gnocchi with sausage is OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD!!  Consistently great
Don't bother -- you will wait four weeks for a table and then be horribly disappointed
The wait staff are rude, the food is mediocre, and it was 80 degrees in the restaurant (and you sit on these horrible plastic covered seats that make your clothes stick to you)
We left before finishing our meal because it was so uncomfortable -- and the food was not worth the discomfort
There are many restaurants in NYC with far better food and much nicer ambiance
If you are willing to wait a month for Batali, shell out the extra cash and go to Babbo
Or go as a walk in
But my advice is don't go at all
Lupa just isn't worth it
Honestly, it is amazing how many people can exhibit such idiocy when reviewing restaurants
How can you order a veal saltimbocca and complain that it is salty? If you ordered pea soup would you write that it tasted too much like peas
The dish is fantastic and so is this restaurant
One of the best in the city
Long long waits, but worth it
Quality is always consistent and top-notch - This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the City
The spaghettinin with cauliflower is to die for!

A chef with a talent for true culinary genius
Roberto is the man
Robertos *is* a classy restaurant
Good food, with a few tasty highlights
I'm not a gourmand with Italian food, so my palate is not all that refined
But to me, the food was flavorful, and good quality - and the ambiance was classy
But was it worth the high prices? Not to me
Too high a cost for food which was very good, but not spectacular
Roberto does come out to check on the meal, which is a great touch
Had dinner there last night and already can't wait to be back
Everything about this place - food, decor, service - were fantastic
We shared an appetizer, a pasta dish and a veal dish and were totally stuffed
The waiters would divide each course equally between our two plates and would whisk the empty plates within a minute
I also really liked that we would get a new clean set of silverware with each course
They don't make reservations and a wait on a Wednesday night at about 8pm was about 15 minutes
They have a very well stocked bar and we passed the time with a nice glass of Chianti
The food is always great and especially the specials like the osso bouco con polenta which they ussually have on the weekends and the tubetine w/ butternut squash, porcini, and shaved parmigian
Unfortanately there are no reservations, so even when we arrive early there are long waits, which makes it even more difficult with large groups
Despite that, it's the best Italian food in the city
The service was efficient and unhurried, the atmosphere was fun, and the food was incredible
Definitely my kind of place--unpretentious and welcoming--easily among the best Italian I've ever had anywhere, including Italy
We had the shrimp w/fennel and arugula appetizer, and the caprese di bufalo which had roasted peppers and mushrooms
Both were amazing
For the entree, I had the fusilli in cartoccio and my partner had the veal scaloppini which had mushrooms, cheese and asparagus
The fusilli was ethereal; fresh seafood with perfect pasta
So good it made me laugh with delight
This place is absolutely not to be missed--worth the trek
If this wonderful little oasis of authentic italian cuisine were located in midtown Manhattan, it would easily win best Italian Restaurant in New York
Everything is so fresh and homemade, you'd think a small armada of Italian mothers were in the back room preparing everything
Roberto himself likes to join the patrons and even offers tips on best way to enjoy his food
The only negative is how far away from city and public transportation
Truly amazing food and fantastic ambiance
roberto's at arthur avenue is the true definition of italian-american cuisine
excellent appetizers, fresh bufala di mozzerella, cozze e vongole too
4 of us for dinner, and with two apps, two pastas, two entrees and two carafes of house wine the bill was still only 120
the best part about the whole night though was when roberto came out towards the end of the 8pm dinner crew and chatted with all his customers
a thoroughly enjoyable experience, the only problem with roberto's is that it's so far from manhattan and brooklyn! worth the trip
Food is delicious, best italian food around
Right next to Arthur Ave in the Bronx
It beats Dominics and all the other Restaurants on Arthur Ave
The Food is all homeade
Roberto's is known for their great Pasta Dishes
Would recommend to anyone, it gets busy so be prepared to wait
Great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries
The waiters are quick and even amusing
A definite must for Madison Avenue shoppers with little time and a hangover
Remember SNL, Cheburga! act, well its alive and well at this small but always busy coffe shop
Great Burgers and the Best Turkey in the World!!! Gotta try the Rice Pudding also!!!
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here
Tiny restaurant with very fast service
Pretty good food too!
Been in search for good chinese to order from for quite a while
Saw the lone review on here for Chinam and decided to give it a shot
So far it's been a match made in heaven
Everything arrives hot and delicious and most importantly, minus some of the random things I've found in other chinese take-out in my area (small piece of strip metal, hair etc
)
Delivery however can be a little slow sometimes, but that's ok
It's worth the wait!
soooooooo good
I just moved to the area and the noodles and dumplings and veggie meats are awesome! i have ordered atleats 3 times this week and will surely do it more
I order from Chinam frequently
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs
Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good value
this place is GREAT
the vegetarian duck with pineapple is incredible
and the dipping sauce that accompanies the pre-meal fare is sooooo good
it's apple-y or something
unique and delicious
yum
I'm getting hungry just thinking about it
as well, the vegetarian spring rolls are great
they have big portions, so go in a group of two or more, and split stuff
oddly, this location has better and more consistently great food than the original location (at 3rd ave and 28th st)
This place definitely has the best dumplings in town
I discovered this place a couple of years ago and order from there at least once a week!
I order from this place all the time - sometimes 3 times a week
Service is great - friendly people
Food is excellent! I recommend the ribs, hot and sour soup, or the soft shell crab!!
In the middle of urban Yonkers, there is an oasis of excellent Middle Eastern Food
Falafel, Shish Kebab, Chumus, Grape Leaves, Shakshooka, and the Fatoosh Salad-- all of it is beautifully prepared, reasonably priced, and delicious
This isn't a Fine restaurant-- it's great food at a great price
This is where I take visitors when I want to show them that Yonkers is more than a punchline
I came here for dinner with a very large group
The restaurant is obviously not equipped to handle large groups
A table of nearly 30 people was allocated one server
The kitchen was also not able to accommodate us in a timely manner
We got food one at a time - with some people having to wait some two hours for food and others being long finished by that point
The decor is forgettable
The sushi itself is better than average though not amazing or anything
I can see myself visiting this place again but it won't be by my choosing
This is my favorite sushi place
The raw fish is always super fresh and they have a wide selection of both sushi and cooked dishes
I especially recommend their spicy tuna and chicken negamaki, both delicious and the best I've ever had
It doesn't hurt that this place is also not too expensive
The service it very very good
the portions are very big, and the fish is also fresh and the prices are great!
In Short A low-key, friendly environment attracts plenty of families to this reliable chain
Kids in the big booths--often clutching free balloons and crayons--usually outnumber adults sitting at the bar
The menu offers filling American fare with no surprises, from mozzarella sticks and nachos to rollups and burgers
Entrees include steaks, fajitas and main dish salads

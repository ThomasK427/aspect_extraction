The bone-in ribeye was unbelievable and very large
By far the best ribeye I've ever had
Others got the strip, the porterhouse for two, and the filet (all were overly pleased)
Besides the quality of the steak seasoned to perfection, the sides make this place the best steakhouse in NYC and beyond
We ordered creamed spinach (fantastic), garlic french fries (good), an unbelievable Goose Fat Potato and even better Creamed Corn with Pancetta
These two sides are a MUST order
you won't be dissapointed
Carbonera sauce was provided on the side
I couldn't fit dessert in my stomach but they all looked fantastic
Service was great
we had called in advance to reserve a table and had one drink at the bar before seating
All in all, a fantastic night and the bill was about $100 per person with 2 rounds of drinks at the table
Ok people
Read the reviews
What do we have, about 99
9% rave reviews for the Strip House? Yes, they sometimes over book and you may have to wait, but this is hardly uncommon in smaller, high-end restaurants
(Would you prefer to be rushed out of your table when it is YOUR turn to dine?) The person who called the Strip House's steak mediocre is probably the owner of a sub-par steakhouse, or is perhaps sleeping with one
This is an unacceptable comment
There is no reasonable person with even the most complicated of palates who would call the Strip House steak mediocre
And I don't know about any of you, but I was a frat boy, and I never went to a fraternity that looked like the Strip House
I hate to bash the basher, but this is clearly a conniving reviewer seeking to rip the Strip House for some other personal reason, and not on the quality of the food or the atmosphere of the room
Go to the Strip House and find out for yourself
Then come back here and pile on more good reviews
The Strip House has earned a very unique niche in the NY restaurant business and fully deserves it
After waiting over a half hour for a 7 pm res
on a Tues
night they finally tried to seat us in the bar area
Dark and crowed
We protested and they finally sat us in the dining room!! We had boring salads to start
And then waited another 40 minutes for our porterhouse
Waiter was apologetic and nice
This was clearly a manegement issue
Steak was pretty standard at best
Overly peppery
Sides are better
To compensate they brought us a complimentary piece of cheesecake
However, management is so disheaveled they actually charged us for it
Sure, you've heard atmosphere is dark and glam
Believe me, it's seen better days
Go some where else for steak
Stop by Striphouse for a drink and to possibly pick up a frat boy
The restaurant is great! I went w/ my father for fathers day and everything was perfect
We both had the rib-eye and it was without a doubt that best steak I have had in NY and I have been to nearly all of the top restaurants
We also ordered the mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans and they were all great as well
Drinks are great, and not terribly priced at $10
I will definitely go back soon!
We've been here a number of times and have always been thoroughly impressed
The martinis are awesome, the porterhouse for 2 is a must, and the truffle creamed spinach cannot be missed
One draw back is the exorbitantly expensive wine list; options are limited if you're looking to spend $40-$50 on a bottle of wine
But don't let that dissuade you; Strip House is our favorite restaurant in NYC and it's worth the scratch
And as an added plus the service is phenomenal
You Can't go to a place calledthe Strip house and not have the Strip! It is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for
The food was excellent!
Had a great business dinner here a few weeks ago and plan to return for my birthday
The ambiance is great and the food is phenomenal
I had the bibb salad, a NY Strip cooked to perfection and we tried almost all the sides
All were great!! The only issue we had was the wait
We waited an addditonal half hour after our reservation which in a business setting was an annoyance
For a more social occassion I wouldn't have cared as they have a nice lounge to have a pre-dinner cocktail in
This rude unaccomodating girl ruined our entire weekend!!!!! Made reservation over a month ago for a special occassion
Reservation was apparently entered into the incorrect day
We called to confirm the day before and the hostess said there was nothing she could do to correct the reservation as they were now full
Not to mention that it was only a reservation for 2 and that nite there ended up being 29 inches of snow
Im sure the restaurant was empty
Thats why she is only a hostess and doesnt have a more prestigious job
Plenty of other better restaraunts in the city where you can be treated better
My boyfriend and I went there a few months ago
We had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 mins for our table
The decor was great, but the food was average
The wine list was limited
I was expecting much more from this restaurant
I had the strip steak and it was nothing special
I have been to several other steakhouses at this same level
I had heard about Strip House and could not wait to go there
Maybe I was there on an off night
I don't know
I don't plan on going there again
I love the atmosphere of this restaurant!!! Most steak houses are tough, gritty, hvy wooden seating, damily style restaurants
The Strip House is dimly lit with sexy black and white photos covering the red walls
Even the napkins have subtle pictures of sexy poses!! There are generally 4-5 waiters attending to each table, not all have the politest attitudes
But the food makes up for that little detail
Definitely good for a date
Also good to lounge at the front bar for a few drinks
The combination of great decor, a hopping scene, and excellent steak are what make Striphouse so good
I've been here a few times and every meal has been excellent
The steaks are cooked to perfection, charred on the outside and cooked to temperature on the inside
The swanky red decor has kind of a 70s porn feel to it, and it works
Even the apps are great (fantastic heirloom tomatoes)
They also have an extensive (but slightly pricy) wine menu
The only minus I would say is the dessert
The chocolate cake is certainly huuuge, but basically tastes like a Hostess cupcake (maybe that's not so bad)
Also, don't have high hopes for being seated on time
I went to striphouse with my girlfriend for our anniversary and had a terrible meal
This is our 5th or 6th time to this restaurant and each and every time we have had incredible service and the food was truly out of this world
However, something has definitely changed at what used to be one of our favorite restaurants in the city
The steak came out relatively cold, was a terrible cut and had little to no taste
I actually had to use the steak sauce just to get through the meal
In the past I would have said this meal was worth every penny you paid, however it seems the quality has gone down and is not worth the money you spend
So save your money and try out a different steakhouse
This restaurant has a great ambiance, great food and is always a treat

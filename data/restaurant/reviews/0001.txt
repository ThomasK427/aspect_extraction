But we did venture over to see her and get a picture
We were also a little disappointed that the martians weren't speaking their native language, two out of the three didn't talk at all
Although, They were so fun to interact with, that it didn't matter
Overall, the service was superb, the waiters were very friendly, the food was excellent, and the bathrooms even had a candy dish! I would definetly reccommend this special intergalactic voyage for anyone looking to have a lot of fun and to leave happy and well-fed
Wow, We loved Mars 2112! It is truely a one-of-a-kind, out of this world experience!
It's amusing for little kids but I really Wouldn't suggest it more that once or twice
some of the very few things that are worth while are that when you walk into the building it looks futuristic because there are loading zones that look like your about to load a Space Ship
The Space Ship is actually a Motion Simulator, and it's supposed to feel like your flying to Mars, so you sit in the motion simulator and it moves around synchronized to the video
When i went when i was a kid a couple years ago the only thing that really amused me about the simulation was that when it showed on the screen that you were landing it was perfectly synchronized so when you actually did land the simulator shook and the doors opened to the restaraunt
The restaraunt is decently modeled to look like mars and it did
but they had people walk around in horribly made alien costumes SO I SAY NO DONT GO
I feel obligated to tell you
this restaurant was simply awful
Not only was the food extremely overpriced but the entire presentation was worse than any other theme restaurant I've ever seen and almost comical, even for children
The ride, which costs a couple of dollars extra, isn't worth it
Even the little ones who shared our experience rolled their eyes
Also, the employee who loaded us on to the ride was less than enthusiastic, to say the least
The food was adequate but absolutely NOT worth the money
We waited forever for our bill but did have a nice conversation with one of our waitstaff during our meal
All in all, we were not impressed!! Our recommendation is to skip this dining experience completely
Besides, the restaurant itself isn't exactly easy to find and it's not easily accessable if you have anybody in your group who is either elderly or has the slighest problem navigating stairs
There are way too many of them
This used to be a fun place with the kids, but the food has gotten really cheap and still overpriced
They also now have a manditory 3 dollar charge per person for the ride so you start with a 12 dollar bill, even if you skip the lame ride
The kids loved it and that's all that mattered
You pay 2 bucks for a simulation ride that your kids will love
They were in awe of the aliens that walked around as they ate and couldn't care less if they ate or not
The food is equivalent to basic bar food and the portions are huge
If you think the prices are outrageous, just take the family, enjoy the ride and go in and order a few appetizers as prelude to a real dinner
Don't expect to love it, but it is worthwhile since your kids will remember it for a long time
If you are going to complain about the $2 ride and $10 coat check, don't go
When you go to a place like this you know what your getting so dont complain that your not getting 5 star food
Im from NY and took my 2 boys there ( 6 and 9) and we had a great time
The atmosphere and ride to the rest were great
The food is typical fair BUT it was much better quality than other theme rests
The aliens walking around were hilarious
THis is NYC dont complain about $
This place is so much fun! You get to go a a rocket ship simulation ride in order to travel to Mars
The main room really looks like Mars
The drinks and the food are awsome, which is totally unexpected in a place like this
The only negative is they won't let you get seperate checks
We were in a party of 10, and they said only two peopel could use credit cards to pay for their portion on the meal
$4
00 coat check, $10 for a tiny drink in a half-size plastic cup, and they automatically added a $2
00 per drink tip on the credit card bill! The nerve of this place
Will never return or recommend it
If you've never been here you should try it at least once
It's definately a tourist stop
The prices are a little bit more than you'd expect with food portions that aren't proportionate to the prices
You're basically paying for the name and entertainment
There's an awesome ride before you enter the restaurant
The overall restaurant appearance was great
They have a great set up inside
We almost didn't come here because of all the neg
reviews
But am glad we did! The food was not gourmet fare it was perfectly fine burgers, salads and pasta
The look of the place must have been really something when they first opened, but now our five year still loved it; our ten year old was suspicious of the hokey decor
The service was polite, friendly and prompt, the characters walking around entertained the kids but werent intrusive to our meal
The staff in general was very friendly
As parents we have endured Chuck E Cheese and Ronald McDonald, think of this a one step up
This place will definitely leave your little ones saying cool over and over again
For grown ups, wait to put them to bed and then have a real meal with a nice martini elsewhere
+ 9 people for $280 in Times Square!!
The family voted to go here because it sounded like fun
BAD decision
First they charged us $2/pp for entertainment, which consisted of a very obnoxious and rude comedien walking around (who insulted my daugther's friend by making fun of her height), the use of the ride and one other alien we saw
If they need money that bad, they could charge a fee for those who wish to take the simulator ride
We, however, walked in
The food was cold, my daughter's burger raw in the middle and we didn't see our waiter for 40 minutes
I finally had to get the host to find him
No one came back with the mayo my daughter requested, to check on our food or refill our drinks
Once is enough -- thought it was a rip-off
There's plenty of places in NYC where your money would be better spent
You have to take a ride to Mars that will make you Space sick
The atmosphere is intriguing and well designed
The menu is relatively bland and expensive, considering its simplicity
Then you order the food and it is beyond not good It is terrible
How can they mess up a salad (soaked in dressing), burn a hamburger and undercook fish and chips
We were so ready to get out of there
Word of mouth needs to spread and tell people to stay away until they improve the food
Don't go!!!!!!!!! My kids said it was the worst part of their visit to NYC
The atmosphere is certainly unlike any other restaurant in all of Manhattan, but it is a pity that the food does not live up to the decor
What this establishment really needs is an overhaul of the entire menu, but then it would still not improve the service: my soup was delivered with half of the contents spilled onto the saucer, thus soaking the spoon
I guess Mars 2112 keeps the food bland for the family fare, but it only serves to detract from its overall experience
Avoid the food, the $2 entrance fee, and head straight to the game room!
This place sucks!!!! At first the decoration of the place is so nice, so I thought this place seemed ok
The ride in the beginning was so damn sorry
The food was below ok
There is definitely better american restaurants in NY
The alien is kind of annoying that goes around the tables
Obviously you are going to have to pay through the nose when visiting a Times Square tourist trap, but come on! Someone in my party inquired about a specific item on the menu, and the waiter said it was terrible
It was ALL terrible
Cafeteria quality food at outrageous prices
The mini ride at the beginning was a very nice touch
The interior decorating, was out of this world but the only thing I personally did not like was the martians walking around
The food was OK, nothing worth going back for
What I do recommend is going once just to fill your curiosity, you won't regret it
I went here twice in Summer 2002 and enjoyed it both times
Yes, it is not a 5 star restaurant, but interacting with the martians and that dr
mars guy is fun in itself

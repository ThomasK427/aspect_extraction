However, after we spent $250 at the end of the meal, and were sitting talking to our out-of-town friends who we hadn't seen for years, they kept giving us obvious signals that we should leave
We ignored them, and finally, they waiter ripped my coat tag out of my hand and threw our coats at us!!!! It wasn't crowded and there was no one waiting for our table
I will never go back there again! The customer service SUCKED
Really adorable restaurant with great backyard dining and reasonably priced lunch specials
This was our first great meal while staying in NYC
Tonight we had the artichoke stuffed with crabmeat for an appetizer and bruschetta! For our entrees we had the Pollo ala Pallazo and the Pollo al Pesto, all of which we amazing
For dessert we had the tiramisu, which was not that special, but the dinner as a whole made up for it in the end
The slightly rustic back patio makes for a wonderful little dining oasis
Don't mind the handlebar moustache-sportin' waiter with the stiff upper lip
The lunch menu is by far the best value
If you are taking the trip to Little Italy stop by this place
it is hard to get into so make a reservation! The food is delicious!!
Boo-hoo to the poster who didn't make a reservation for a party of 7
I made a reservation for five people
We were seated promptly, and had a fantastic meal
The wine list is very good, but a carafe of the house wine actually happens to be a nice compliment to the meal, and at a reasonable price
The food is delicious
I am a big fan of Little Italy, and this place does not disappoint
I recommend the garden in the back for a nice ambiance, or out front seating for some great people-watching
We had a reservation for 15 at 8PM
6 of us got there earlier, we started ordering tapas and drinks
Some people started arriving, but we were not 15 yet
The waitress (a Brazilian, forgot her name) started to question when we would have 15 people
Why was she was getting all flustered about it when 2 tables next to ours were empty!!! Eventually we had 15 people, but some were coming and leaving
The waitress kept giving us attitude, said for a large table we need to consume $20/person
Our tab was already $300+! One friend came around 10PM, he had to pay $15 cover charge!!! Later she said she was leaving, wanted to close her tab, we order one more Sangria pitcher
She did the same thing 2 more times!!!! We spent close to $500 that evening
Me and my friends used to go there and loved it
Not a great crowd lately
One night we were there and the DJ played the same songs over and over again
Not cool
I went there about three times, one for dinner on a sunday evening which is a salsa night after dinning, the service was slow and a bit rude, the plates average some shrimp octopus and empanadas
I went on a friday and saturday nights, and it was awesome, didnt like the cover of $15 for a restaurant c'on after 11 or so when the owner decides to charge you, but awesome time, attentive bartenders but try to avoid the whiskey, go for beer or sangria
What I found was poor food, poor service, high prices and a snobby ambience
Beware of the 7:30 PM reservation on Saturday night
Just after 8:30 PM, you might be told to leave for a 9pm reservation! The 9pm folks were not even there at 830 (would YOU be??) and were not even there at 930 when I left the place
I was told that I could not order my SECOND round of FOOD DRINKS
After arguing with the staff for about 15 minutes they realized how RIDICULOUS ILLOGICAL they decided that we could stay
more like they had no choice because we were not about to leave because someone mistakenly overbooked a table
All my life as a New Yorker, I have never had such a rude experience at ANY restaurant in NYC, whether it be McDonalds or Le Cirque
The food was larger portions for a tapas menu and the service was great! (Of course it helps to speak in the native tongue
) Also, the ambience has a very rustic, romentic feel
I was about to leave the place as soon as I got there
It's small and crowded (and lacks the feeling of coziness)
The decor requires a major uplift
And they don't even notice that you have entered and need to be seated
I had to wait at least 10 minutes to be noticed
The hostess has a bad attitude and some of the wait staff are a bit arrogant (although, luckly not all)
The wine list is very limited-- only 4 red and 4 white
Spain is all about wine; they could do better
However, I was glad to have stayed
The food is delicious, fresh, and ample
The pulpo (octopus) and the boquerones were among the best I have had in New York
Bear in mind that I lived in Madrid for about a year and traveled all over Spain
There are not many places where you can eat, drink and have a wild dance party without leaving the room
Start early and you won't feel rushed when the staff moves the tables to let the party start
Ample portions of food at reasonable prices
I found the service excellent
Went there for a dinner; nice little place
the chairs and the table were very uncomfortable though
The food was good; liked the shrimp with garlic sauce! The service/waiters weren't not too nice, were trying to get rid of us and take the tables/chairs away to turn in into a lounge/dancing when we weren't even done with the food
we arrived early on a Saturday night with a party of 14 which they accomodated very nicely, the pitchers of Sangria were really tasty and the fruit was very fresh, the tapas that were exceptional to mention were the meatballs, cheese, and the shrimp with garlic sauce, we also enjoyed the dulce de leche pancakes for dessert
the bread was the best thing on the table interestingly enough
this place was too dark, they needed more candles, music was also good
nice place to relax with friends
The service was poor and full of attitude
Stay away from the chorizos
Poor quality sausage makes for a poor value and almost inedible salty dish
The fish dish was palatable but tasteless and included a weak curry flavor that has nothing to do with Spain
This is a psuedo-tapas bar that forgot to use the most authentic spanish flavoring -- garlic
In NY we have options of real spanish restaurants
This is not one of them
Call it a bar with weak but tasty sangria and leave it at that
Eat elsewhere
i really enjoyed th music and had fun dancing though it was overpaced and overpriced ($15 for a small bar COME ON!!!) i had a blast and definitely would reccomend it for latin rock and salsa and merengue and 80's
It's a wonderful place to go dancing, it's fun a mix of rock en espanol, salsa, merengue, 80's and spanish pop
Thursdays it's free but not as many people show up and on fridays and saturdays you can get in for free before 11 or so
but it's not a set time, it depends on when the owner feels to charge
The food is good, but very overpriced for the small portions, the sangria is very good though and not expensive if you buy a pitcher
if the restaurant is reading this, think:constructive criticism! cendrillon is a bastardization of filipino cuisine, and filipino food aside, the cuisine at cendrillon is not a destination point considering the fantastic restaurants in new york
I get the fusion thing
i even understand numbing the taste/sourness of filipino food for our non-filipino friends; however, cendrillon's take on filipino food is basically an insult to the cuisine
the kare-kare was dry and the meat/vegs were so tiny and boiled down to the point of being unrecognizable
AND THAT'S THE BEST THING ON THE MENU
okay okay, perhaps the national dish adobo was palatable, but i beg you do not think this is filipino food
no there are not great filipino restaurants in NYC as far as decor/trendiness and cendrillon does it's best to break that stereotype
but i'll take turo-turo or simple, homey filipino restaurants over this sad example any day
It is a little ironic that for a fusion Filipino restaurant, the food at Cendrillon is quite bland! The decor is nice, but the service is very slow
If you like or if you want to try halo-halo (Filipino ice and fruit dessert), this is not the place to order it because you will only be served a bowl of ice - literally
I was once accused of being unsophisticated for not liking this restaurant - but it's not about sophistication (or location) when it comes to good food
Yes, the place smacks of Soho sophistication, but in the end, a restaurant's main asset is its food, and without good food, it's not worth going to no matter how many fabulous furnishings or wine selections it may have
That is why I do not recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to eat (authentic or fusion) Filipino food
Cendrillon is lovely inside, but not in a frou-frou way, the design feels warm very comfortable
The owners also support local artists' with their work on the walls too
The owners have always been friendly to me, or at least gracious if it's busy
Overall the food is delicious
Yes to the adobo, kare kare, and the paella, ukoy tapa salad
Triple yes to the goat curry appetizer oh my god to the mango tart
No to the blueberry tart
My mom is Filipina (and a fabulous cook), so I grew up on good Filipino food

Flavors of the tofu caserole and kimchi appetizers are delicious, intense, and fresh, thanks to the large clientele this restaurant serves
This place is only a few stores down from Macys so it is NOT to be missed
I've had food at other establishments in flushing but this is the BEST- definitely a secret family recipe
Saturday Night before Mother's Day
After waiting forever for a menu, we got their regular menu along with a pre-fixed menu (pre-determined dishes based upon the # of people)
However, the waiter urged patrons to order pre-fixed because they ran out of certain foods said it would take even longer for regular menu items
Pre-fixed menu choices were overpriced dishes selected were so-so, but what choice did we have
We were on the third dish before we even got rice (we had to ask twice)
Some dishes were too salty
As the night went on, they even ran out of certain pre-fixed dishes
Waitstaff was non-existent
Others complained about the poor service even walked out
At the end of the night, we left only a $2 tip because of the poor service the waiter had the nerve to harrass us for more money as we left
This place is a dive bar - but a fun, inviting, and friendly, dive bar
The owner and patrons make the place a fun place to go and drink - PLUS, the drinks are affordable
People in the neighborhood should definitely give the bar a try
However, there is no food there - so don't even think about asking!
Warning, this is a no frills restaurant where the service is brisk, but the sashimi is great
Order the platter deal for at least 3 ppl and you will get a lot of side dishes
This is a local neighborhood restaurant and I don't recommend going in the evening (lots of drinking amongst a older crowd), but the weekday lunch special can't be beat and early dinner (before 8) is great
I went for dinner with a friend who had been to Cafe Rubio before
There was entertainment, a nice crowd nad the food was great! We opted for the shrimp with tostones as an app and then I had the stuffed lobster tail with shrimp and he has a grilled chicken salad
All in all
great fare at a reasonable price
The only draw back was the drabby decor which is in dier need of a a makeover!
These empanadas are really the best
You have to try the figue-caramel-cheese one
I have tried them at the new Mama's Empanadas in Sunnyside, 42-18 Greenpoint Ave
The place is just a (friendly) take away
But be prepared to come back once you've tried their empanadas
I like just about all of their curries, and most of their dishes are uniformly excellent
Only one I didn't like was a mixed seafood dish that didn't taste particularly fresh, but it could have been a one-time thing, because every other dish I've had there is quite good
Nice ambience, good service, and great, inexpensive lunch specials
They also offer take-out
The decor is gorgeous, the service is good and the food fabulous
I being a very aesthetic person was in love with their plates and serving plates
Even the small bowls in which they serve rice is gorgeous
The ingredients are very fresh and the food tasty
I lived in Thailand for 5 years and love eating at BaanThai
Go try it!
This is the perfect place for a date with it's ambiance, dimmed lighting and sensational food
Anyone who likes Thai food will love this little piece of Thailand in the middle of Queens
Great for a cozy dinner for two or a slightly larger gathering
They offer both spicy and more mild choices, but if you like to kick up the heat, you will be more than satisfied with thier combination of sweet and hot spices
The decorations in there are beautifuL! The waitors are so attentive and friendly, I loved it
I totally recommend the spring rolls as appetizer, pad thai or the the red snapper as main dish
enjoyed the food
everything was tasty
i had a wonderful time
i will definately be returning
Asian art on walls, statuttes standing on bannisters, on the bar, and even suspended from ceiling make for a lovely setting
The food is great - an extensive selection of authentic Thai dishes, including a vegetarian menu
The service is prompt, helpful and courteous
Even the plates and utensils are pretty
I like this place
In FH, this is the only place to get decent sushi without having to wait a long wait at Narita
It's small, but most of the times, the wait is not too long
I used to go here for takeout because the place is to tiny to dine in
Sushi is slightly subpar, but edible and relatively cheap
However, recently the service has been so rude, I can't justify recommending anyone visit them
I certainly won't
What a shame
This charming place offers more than just kind service and tasty food
Not only the sushi is great (try their Rainbow Sushi) but also the restaurant itself has unique atmosphere and it's very close from 61 St Woodside, 7 train
I recommend it: delicious and not expensive Japanese food, peaceful place and very nice people
I love to be here and eat here
The Scene Well-heeled wait-listers squeeze into the narrow lounge where a young, international jet-set crowd sips cocktails on mod couches
The downstairs dining room, with anime projections and a splashy sushi bar, is flush with music and fun; upstairs is quieter and more refined
Servers are fast, but fumble often
The Food Le Bernardin chef Eric Ripert consults, but it's chef Michael Vernon who's really behind the stunningly inventive menu
Interpreting the exotic flavors of Japan, and utilizing super-fresh fish, he builds bold yet balanced dishes: Wasabi roe bursts with sharp brine atop mackerel-scallion-ginger tartare; roasted pumpkin quenelles lend sweet heft to aromatic curry broth with whole-shrimp dumplings; and sesame-soy enlivens a texturally thrilling ruffle of four fresh seaweed varieties
Main dishes build to exciting crescendos, both in surf--buttery roasted lobster with asparagus-mushroom udon--and turf--umeshu-port-glazed pork with gingered cabbage
Went here with my parents just for a nice Friday dinner
Quite a wonderful restaurant
Great ambiance (we were seated on the second floor, in the area facing out of the windows) and very nice, attentive service
I had the white tuna tartar, which was delicious, and my mother had the special lobster appetizer
Excellent all around
I had two rolls for dinner, my parents both had the miso salmon, which I had eaten before
The salmon fell apart in our mouthes and the rolls were well balanced
Dessert was another story, as they have a nice list of teas, which you should ask for (they have more than they give you in their dessert menu)
Anything nutty is delicious, I've had them all!
The first time I went here I thought it was just okay
It tasted as good as a regular sushi joint you find anywhere
However the second time I went the food was great
You just have to order the right things! The fried oysters in spicy dipping sauce is divine and the tar tar tasting is exquisite
The rolls and entrees are just okay
nothing special
Perhaps this place is better suited for drinks and a small bite
Went there for friend's bday, the tab ended up being ridiculously expensive, the atmosphere was nothing special, in fact there was a custmer who was sprikling the whole place with her BO
I would not recommend this place to an enemy
While the sushi and appetizers were ok (nothing special) the portions were so small, and so over priced that we could not believe it
There were many a-times when asked what I think about literally a spoonfull of the food, that i would say I think I like it but I havent fully tasted it with my whole mouth
DO NOT go to this place, if youre going to spend $60 a person on appetizers alone, please just go and have yourself a piece of steak!
Of course, many of us have had bad sushi experiences where the fish quality was low grade and our stomaches would be turning when we got home
But have you ever had a mediocre sushi experience? You know
the fish is fair quality but they only give you a sliver that's laid on top of a whopping mound of rice
Then there's the huge slab of fish on top of some buried rice you can't see
Now, really, do you LIKE taking two bites from one piece of sushi?! I don't
At Geisha, the fish quality seemed excellent and is quite proportionate to the amount of rice
I shared a $50 sushi/plate

mmm! This restaurant can easily be overseen but that would be a HUGE mistake
Perfectly cooked, el dente pasta, AMZING baked clams, cheap but great wine, friendly service, comfy and non-pretentious setting all for unseen prices for this kind of food
Yummy
Delicious
Good, simple, no-frills classic American-Italian food
Go Brooklyn!
Anyone who thinks John's Pizzaria on Sixth in Manhattan has the best brick-oven pies hasn't been here - it's well worth the trek if you don't live in Bay Ridge (as are many restaurants in the area)
The chicken parmagiana sandwiches are also superb
Prices are not bad
Lento's pizza is the ultimate
The freshness of the ingredients down to the perfection of the crust, it is truly the best
So perfect it is sinful
The food portion got smaller
The burgers were much bigger and the price jumped up alittle bit
But they do take credit cards now
The food is still good and the service is quick
Seriously
This place sucks
I made reservations for a group of 10 several days in advance, and checked back that same day to make sure everything was set
Arrived at the restaurant and was told it would be 10 minutes, which turned into 30, which turned into close to an hour
Entire staff was completely unaccomodating and rude, which was really awful considering we had two elderly women and one very pregnant one
Left before the hour turned into two
Went to Canedo's down the street and were treated wonderfully and had a great meal
The staff at Sancho's are utterly unreliable on top of being dishonest and unorganized
The absolute worst restaurant experience I've ever had!! If you have to choose Spanish food in Bay Ridge, I'd avoid Sancho's (and its cheap jug-wine sangria) like the plague
Bleccch!!
The waitstaff is friendly (although their English can be lacking) and quick
We were seated right away on a Sunday evening but the restaurant was definitely filled with all types of people offering a warm atmospher
The smoked salmon appetizer was pretty good (it comes with goat cheese, calpers and onions)
I had a house special (don't remember the name) with scallops, prosciutto, tomato sauce and cheese and it was soooo yummy! My boyfriend had the seafood paella and that was equally yummy
There are not too many places in Bay Ridge that offer quality seafood but this place is great!!! I highly recommend this place after my first and only visit
Went to Sancho's for Valentine's Day evening dinner
My husband and I were looking forward to trying a new restaurant in the neighborhood and read the reviews of Sancho's
Boy were we sorry that we chose this restaurant because everything was tasteless and dry
We had shrimp with lobster sauce as an appetizer and it had no zing to it or any lobster in it
The paella was dry and tasteless and so was my husband's scallops
In fact the scallops tasted the same as the shrimps
Nothing had any flavor
Needless to say we won't be going back there and the next time we are in the mood for Spanish food we will go to Casa Pepe which is outstanding
To tell you the truth I don't know where these other people ate who gave such rave reviews, but it surely wasn't Sancho's
This is certainly one of the best places to eat in Brooklyn
We go there at least once in two months
The food is delicious and prepared well
It's located in Bay Ridge which is an easy commute from New York or any other borough
It's very reasonably priced considering the size of portions
If you like Spanish food, I reccomend it 100%
4 of us went here for dinner last night
excellent! Although my crowd was a bit concerned about the overwhelming fish smell when we walked in the door, we were not disappointed by the food
Even the fish-hater in our group, who ordered lamb, was very pleasantly surprised
My paella was out of this world, a huge portion, and $14! (I have paid $25 for the same in Manhattan
) Excellent seafood! Excellent atmosphere
waiters? Not bad, but just ok
I've been going to Gino's for over 15 years, since they were a tiny little pizzeria with a few red booths lining the wall
They've since increased in size by at least 5 times, but the food continues to wonderful
You may have to stand around for a while, but it's worth the wait for great food and service at a reasonable price
OK, the only way to not have to wait an hour to be seated is if you get there at a wierd time like 4 or 5pm
That's my best advice
I have been a fan for years and I have never gotten a dish that I didn't like and the service has always been outstanding
The decor is nice but not my taste (murals of italian countrysides and vinyards
) but hey, it's an Italian restaurant, it makes sense
I hope the new additional room will make for less waiting, we'll see
Gino's has turned into an expensive restaurant with extremely long wait times
Food is average
The pizza is usually burnt or undercooked
The serving sizes- again average
If you want to spend alot of money on bland food - then Gino's is your place to go
You cannot go wrong at Gino's - EVERYTHING IS GREAT
The House salad is big enough to split, The Fried Calamari is some of the best I ever ate, the bowties broccoli, broccoli rabe, square slices, broiled filet of sole, clam sauce
DELICIOUS! Prices are reasonable, cannot beat the fresh quality of all their food
The service is great - friendly, fast and perfect
Go early on weekends, there is usually a line out the door; call ahead for reservations and expect to leave STUFFED
Gino's is a wonderful resturant! My fiance` proposed to me there- the service was wonderful- and the food is out of this world!
Last of a dying breed
Those who know good food, know Ginos is one of the last great down home italian restaurants around here, where you dont have to take out a 2nd mortgage to enjoy yoruself with a large group of people
I love their menu, consistently good, simple, and always reliable and AFFORDABLE
Glad to see they renovated and expanded
she deserves it
Getting a table at Gino's is can be pretty brutal -- the line is often out the door
See if you can get a seat at the bar and have a drink! Once you are seated it is well worth it
The food seems to be pretty simple but very very tasty -- definitely a good bang for the buck
The servers treat you well even though they are insanely busy
ITS ALWAYS A PLEASURE COMING BACK TO A JOINT THAT YOU REMEMBER AS A YEARS BACK AND IT DOESN'T SPOIL THE MEMORIES! THE DECOR HAS BEEN UPDATED TO A FULL BLOWN RESTAURANT BUT THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY HASN'T CHANGED
THE FOOD HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN BETTER, MORE CHOICES BUT THE OLD STANDBYS ARE STILL GREAT
THE BAKED CLAMS OR VEAL CULTLETS ARE STILL THERE BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
I STILL LOVE IT!
This used to be my favorite restaurant but now that prices went up, the food quality has gone down
In the past few years they spiced up their look to seem more like a restaurant than a pizzeria
They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!  I liked it better when it was smaller and friendlier
ATE THERE FRIDAY
WAITED A HALF HOUR, BUT SO WORTH IT
GREAT FOOD, PRICES, SERVICE AND AMBIANCE
VERY TRENDY
AS AN ITALIAN, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
ASK FOR EDDIE, A GREAT WAITER
TRY THE GRILLED CHICKEN OR ROLLITINI
FRANK FROM BROOKLYN
Gino's is both a great old-school Italian-American joint (STILL family owned and operated), but is best for its Pizza, which can be delivered
The crust is the perfect medium between chewy and crispy, the sauce is slightly, but not overbearingly, sweet and the mozzarella is of the highest quality
My fave place for Pizza in Brooklyn
Went there during restaurant week in Brooklyn, earlier this year

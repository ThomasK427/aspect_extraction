Well, I'm impressed by Mazhi
Their sushi is always very fresh, the portions are huge, the presentation is always so creative/funny/elaborate/gorgeous
The service is great too
not that great
messed up my order and while most of the sushi was fresh and delicious, the tuna was gray and fishy
that kind of sucked when my sushi sashimi combo was made of more than 30% tuna (which could not be eaten)
thai food is supposed to be great though and the place is pretty nice looking inside
i would try the thai
Not sure how this place stays in business because it is never crowded - maybe takeout, maybe lunch crowd - however the sushi is amazing - amazing $6 martinis too
Its close to my apt so I hope more people go because this is definitely a hidden gem
I think 34th st between Lex and Park doesnt get as much traffic as 3rd avenue at night - if this place was on 3rd it would be packed every night - I highly recommend this place
We went there for dinner with friends
The food was very good and besides the smaller portions, the grilled octopus salad and gnocchi were very tasty
The service was very prompt and helpful
We even were able to have a conversation in Portuguese with our waiter who suggested the delicious brick roasted chicken and roasted monkfish
The wine list offers some wonderful Italian wines
A very good meal but when the bill came
it was a bit pricey
All in all a good experience and great service!!
My Girlfriend and I were invited to this restaurant by a couple who live over the street in the Printing House building
The couple we were dining with were jet-lagged and didn't want to venture out too far so we checked out this new Greenwhich Village local
What a mistake
The ambience was way off
We had to ask the Matre D to dim the lights (not a good sign)
We ordered Gin Tonics to start which took an age to come
The waiter had little knowledge of the wine list
The temperature was way off with most diners too cold (many were wearing jumpers to keep warm)
You would think that the staff in a new restaurant would be very enthusiastic about a new venture
Not here
What a miserable bunch
Food was average (I could have easily bought the antipasti from the local deli)
Not cheap either
Avoid
WOW
My husband and I ate at this newcomer to Greenwich Village last week and we will be back
a lot
The cocktails are refreshing and original, the wine list has great picks for all price ranges, and the food was to die for
We had the house cured sardines, grilled shrimp with fennel, spag carbonara, ricotta gnocchi, veal with polenta, and cod
Sounds like a lot, but the potions are made to do a three course meal, and so are the prices
Very resonable for the quality
Would suggest splitting the pasta course if not that hungrey because it's the best! nd dessert
everything please
The service and ambience (I want my living room to look like this place) was wonderful as well
Our server was full of recommendations and personality
Can't wait to try lunch!
The food, service, deco, ambience were below average at best
Decoration/ambience was like neighborhood Chinese takeout place, their food was below average/portion was small
And their entree was about $26 to $28
? They got nothing to compete with
compared to other great Tiribeca restaurants in the same price range
They charge even more than PO, LUPA
which are famous for great food
they should just lower the price and become a friendly neighborhood italian restaurant
I mean how are they going to survive in NYC??
If you want to eat in a sweat box, this is the place to go! I went there on Sat
7/29/06
the start of the 2nd heatwave of the summer
No AC in the place, not even a fan
The waiter told me that the AC was on, but that the restaurant leaves the windows and doors open because the air conditioning system breaks often, so some ocasional wind from outside is better than nothing
Personally, I think management knows people don't eat as much at a buffet when they are dehydrated from heat exhaustion
Which leads me to my 2nd gripe -- we had nothing to drink for half our meal
No one came to refill our water even after we asked
Thirdly, the salad bar had a very limited selection as did the meat buffet
But if you like steak you got your choice of flank, skirt, filet mignot, chuck, steak wrapped in bacon, etc
The only other meat besides steak was this one dish of chicken thigh
What happened to the sausages, lamb, pork, etc
? Fourth, it was my friend's birthday and we had a cake we asked to be brought out after we finished our meal
Not only did the waitress ruin the surprise by asking us if we wanted our cake now, she didn't bring out the cake until 30 minutes later and by that time it was melted! The only positives are the belly dancers that come out to entertain the sweaty customers and that the meat guys come frequently with the various steaks
Definitely not as good as Churrascaria Tribeca/Midtown
I hear a place in Queens is comparable to Churrascaria and only $25
I suggest that you spend your $35 somewhere else or bring your own water and fan
Or maybe go in the winter and hope they have heat!
i really enjoyed this spot
went there on a saturday night
wasn't too much of a crowd, a little over half full
i had a very very positive experience with the service
drinks, meat and extra sides all came out right when we needed them
food was great! and at $35 for all you can eat including dessert i don' think you're going to find a better deal
and if that wasn't enough the owner threw in a free beer each for me and my friend
go and enjoy!
I had read a good review of this restaurant, which persuaded me to try it
I have been to the more expensive and larger Brazilian BBQ's in the theater district so this seemed to be a great value
You get what you pay for
Prompt seating, yes
Good service, NO
Good Drinks, yes
Good meat, yes
when you could get it! The four us sat down at 8:30
It took 10 minutes to get water
Constantly grabbing waiters for bar drink refills
And the Meat
we never saw it
You should not go to a Brazilian BBQ place and have to chase the waiters and go to the hostess ASKING FOR MEAT
At 9:45 I was still HUNGRY
Ridiculous
Not only would I not recommend it, I would discourage
A shame, we went with such high hopes
This is a new place, and so it hasnt drawn in a huge crowd just yet, but once word gets out about this little gem, it'll be a hit
Its a $35 fixed price per person, not counting drinks ofcourse
Like any brazilian restaurant, you come there for the meat, and the meat is EXCELLENT

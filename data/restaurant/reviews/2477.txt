You get what you pay for
Great place for breakfast or brunch
poor food, poor surroundings, expensive prices
go to e-s-sa bagel for better food and cheaper prices
Unfortunately fushape1 is right
This place has plenty of old world deli ambience, but the prices do not backup the Depression-era serving sizes or the indifferent service
The portion size for the nova and whitefish salad platter (which barely served two) was insulting for the $23 pricetag
The bagels were completely average, as was the nova
Latke's were three for $6!!! (Appetizers cost as much as a good entree would in a decent deli or diner
) Service left a lot to be desired, and I almost had to get out of my seat to grab my waiter's attention when we needed some extras
I left feeling ripped off and would never go back
Just like the old appetizing stores with the wonderful smoked fish cheeses
Delightful!
The food here is first rate, as are the bagels
You may argue whether its worth the price, but the quality is never the issue
Perhaps the people complaining about the bagels think Lenders make great ones
Famed Barney Greengrass is simply the best!! we had the smoked fish platter for two
When I ordered i thought the $70 price was steep
However, when the food arrived i realized it was $70 well spent
the platter included large portions of lox, smoked salmon steak, smoked sturgeon, smoked cod and smoked whitefish
It was simply the best i have ever had
The bagels exhibited all the qualities that a proper Ny stile bagel should have
Any future trip to new york will include a trip to barney greengrass
Needless to say, if you think a cinnamon raisin bagel is a good bagel, than dont go here
you will be dissapointed
This outfit only dishes out the realdeal!!
I finally visted this over-hyped shop while in the city hoping it was as good as the stories
The sad truth is that my bagel w/lox cr cheese dissapointed on all levels
The bagel was literally almost stale and there was actually more tomato on it than salmon
FOR ALMOST ELEVEN DOLLARS!! NO excuse for stinginess at these prices
I can get better for half the price in New Jersey, and they actually put some fish on your sandwich
Skip this place
I fear writing a great review might increase my sunday wait already at 45-min for a chance to sample the absolute best nova in town! The service is great and the place is a kickback to old school deli's like my parents once enjoyed
and yes, the latkes are really worth ordering!
good brunch but too crowded
They need better bagels
In New york this shoul'd'nt be a problem
I was sadly disappointed in this place
The fish is undeniably fantastic, but the bagels really stink
Instead of eating here, I recommend taking out some lox or sable or what-have-you, heading down to HH bagels on 80th and Broadway to pick up some decent bagels, and then eating at home
It's the only way to do Barney Greengrass toppings justice
At ten to ten, the brunch mob swarms in so do them one better and get here at 9:30
That way you'll be immersed in your luscious lox and eggs, laughing as the lines pile up outside when ten o'clock rolls around
The food's well worth the accumulated hatred of strangers standing in line, lusting after your table
Savor the sturgeon and enjoy
Four people had four 2 lb
lobster meals a bottle of wine, two drinks and a few beers
The bill came to over $370 and we questioned a $2 charge for chocolate sauce on the ice cream
The Monday night manager said that under no circumstances could she ever remove this charge as it was set by the chef and she had no authority to change it
The fact that when we placed our order at 6:30 they had already run out of the size lobster we wanted and as a result we ordered a more expensive meal made no difference
Docks has good food, adequate service and an unbelievably bad concept of what customer service means
I was in to have dinner on Saturday Oct
10, 2004
The food was great
I had a halibut dish that just was to die for
The specials starrt at 5pm, I was able to fing out that they have a Clam Bake night in which my husband and I will be going to on Sunday
I love the oysters, they have a Oyster feastable twice a year, hay every Noverber
I will be eating here everytime we go to the city
Docks is hassle free great food on the Upper West
Fish is fantastic
No frou- frou, portions are great
Recently had waitress say she could not recommend a white wine, questionnable at best
But they have great fresh seafood and always crowded and friendly
Try not to get a table in the way back, it's a little claustrophobic back there
Always a reliable choice if you are in the mood for seafood and close by
It's not the best seafood in the world, but it is consistent and solid
The fresh oysters in season can be excellent -- like buttah
A while back, a ceviche special -- a novel version with orange juice served in a wine glass, was really good
Staff is good, usually knowledgeable, friendly neighborhood feel
Solid seafood offerings highlight the menu here at Dock's on the Upper West Side
Was seated right away on a Thursday night and started with the mussels in tomato and garlic sauce, which was about what one might expect
The portion was huge though, and must have included 30 mussels; that, coupled with the fine bread basket, was a meal in itself but I of course was just getting started
My lady started with the cold seafood salad which we agreed was one of the great salads we've ever experienced
Entree-wise I went with the whole Pompano/lemon caper sauce from the specials menu--also excellent
The whole package plus a couple of drinks came to $75--can't beat it
Service was excellent, though slightly rushed
On the whole, a pleasant surprise

The Scene The sweeping space accommodates as many as 400 diners on three levels
It's a frenzy of activity: Walk-ins crowd the reception area; half a dozen sushi chefs furiously palm rice rolls at the upstairs raw bar; chopstick-wielding customers battle for dim sum; and good-natured waitstaff scrambles to keep pace
If you're looking for intimacy, forget it--this is a setting for revelry
The Food Owner Steve Hanson is one of the largest fish buyers in the city, and the offerings at Ruby Foo's are fresh and attractively presented
The remaining fare consists of dim sum appetizers, a handful of soups and salads and wok-fired specialties
Entrees are perfectly acceptable, if unmemorable
The best are those with a good dose of garlic and soy sauce
great great food
I definitely would consider this one of my favorite spots in the city
I absolutely love the tuna
and as for the sushi
you cant beat it
the atmosphere is totally cool and fun
and really nice for a crowd
the drinks are also worth trying
definitely going back and back and back
For a steven hanson restaurant this place in one word sucked!! our reservation was for 7:30, we arrived early and were told we had to wait
We sat at the bar and had suprisingly good drinks, the bartenders were very friendly and helpful in choosing one of their foo-foo cocktails
We were finally seated at 8:15, and our server was horrid, she knew nothing of the specials and told us all the wrong ingredients in the dishes we ordered
If we ever go back again, we'll just sit at the bar!
You are in Times Square; by far the best restaurant in the area

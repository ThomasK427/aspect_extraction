I came here with a group of 8 for my birthday
We were in a side room and the waiters kept coming around and turning the lights on and off, dimming it up and down and it was really annoying
Although our food took forever and our waiter was really aloof, the food was pretty good, though overpriced
I got the pollo alla genovese which was just chicken and artichokes in a cream sauce
it was good, and the veggies were ok
All the food was just average
I don't think I'll be going back, but it was acceptable
I just ate there and the service and food was horrible! We waited for the food forever, when it came the food was soggy and NOT worth what you pay for
you can make better pasta at home
Just boil some pasta and open up a ragu, that's better than paying $16! I don't know how they stay in business, all the waiters should be fired! They just don't seem to care about anything
In fact, just to let them know, I left them a penny for their lovely service
They really need to shape up or close down! I hope the owner is reading this and the rest of the reviews
I waited two hours for a delivery and every time I called to check on it, the manager told me another story
Manager also proposed that I come down to see him face to face to handle the problem
If you're hungry, don't order here because the food will never come or you'll get in a fight
Staff was not courteous at all, no greeting when we walked in the door, waiter didn't tell us any special - basically said 3 words the whole night
The cold chicken parm had a leg bone hanging out of it and the first bite was only a bone
rigatoni was very salty
too expensive for the quality
This was by far the WORST restaurant experience I've ever had in my life! Although the food was alright to start, the center of our lasagna was frozen! Management then proceeded to lie to us about their fresh lasagna, which we were later told is frozen early in the week and reheated to be served at a pricey rate
The owner of the restaurant actually came out to point his fingers at us and raise his voice, saying that we insulted him! He then stormed out of the restaurant
We were in complete shock
I've never witnessed such unproffessional behavior! I highly recommend that you avoid this place at all cost
Unless, however, if you enjoy leaving restaurants nauseated and offended, then I would suggest you eat at Buona Sera
We ate here once and the waiter was very aggressive about pushing the specials instead of what was on the menu
We ordered entrees from the menu instead
Then, he tried to get us to order some appetizers, he described several of them (again, not on the menu)
We liked one of the salads he mentioned, so we ordered it
When we got our bill the salad appetizer we ordered cost $16 whereas our entrees cost $12 to $14
I really felt tricked, but of course I didn't ask him the price upfront, so I couldn't complain
I felt very bad about the experience though; they obviously intend to manipulate the customer to increase the price of the bill
I ordered a three cheese lasagna in pesto sauce the first time I tried this place
When my entree arrived, there was so much pesto sauce, it was spilling over the side of the plate
My lasagna was only distinguishable by the tiny lump it made in the middle of the plate
The actual lasagna itself (when I was able excavate it from underneath it all) wasn't even warm and tasted as though it had been pulled out of the fridge and zapped in the microwave
I could have handled this place a lot better if only the prices had better, but fifteen dollars for a piece of lasagna I couldn't even eat because it was nothing but lukewarm pesto sauce was ridiculous
Decided to give this place a try after walking past it about a thousand times
Heard the lasagne was good, so ordered that
It was COLD (not lukewarm even) in the middle
Sent it back, and I got the same piece of lasagne
just cut into fours and microwaved
C'mon
at least give me a fresh entree! That was embarrassing (for them)
Also
a bit overpriced
but I have to say it was tasty and they have big portions
Still won't be back though b/c of the microwave incident
consistently good food: excellent varieties of polenta and the lasagna is awesome
nice wines, cozy space - a window seat affords great people watching
service is mixed
had advance reservations for group of 15 for 8pm
two of my friends were running late, but 13 of us arrived at 8 sharp
the host refused to seat us because our entire party was not there
meanwhile, the restaurant was empty, and my friends stood huddled and crowded in the narrow entry-way
after complaining, another hostess gave us our table
but first host told us we had to leave if the other 2 guests did not arrive
has anyone ever heard of this practice?? then, our food took over an hour to get to our table
portions were small
1 plate of pasta fed 3 people, tops
the penne ala vodka was under-cooked
penne was hard
Dim Lights, Great Food, Great Service, Excellent Price and good Location
I strongly recommend this resturant
I have been going here for years for the excellent family style Italian food and good value
We had our rehearsal dinner here and the sevice was outstanding and the wide selection of food was great for a large group
Everyone raved about it! I would recommend this place highly both for service and delicious food!
NOT RECOMMENDED!!! Ambience and food were overshadowed by the worst service I've ever experienced
Our waiter never once came to our table unless we asked the bus-boy to ask the waiter to come by
WE had to ask about specials, desserts, and basically had to beg for more drinks
Upon leaving a 10% gratuity, the manager asked why the below-average tip
Upon explaining, the waiter confronted us as we left and spewed a stream of profanities at us as we walked out the door
Never again
Family Sizes portions are not large enough; there are more like single serving
The family sizes portion is only sufficient as long as you go with people who are on a diet; lucky for me two of the four at the table were on a diet
The foods were light not over powering
Good/Average foods compared to other places around the area
Do not go to this place
First of all, the place was empty, and yet our server was hardly there
we got more help from the busboys than the waiter
Appetizers were good, but the main courses were terrible
The ravioli was still raw
the lasagna tasted like mac and cheese
You can get better italian food at the Olive Garden
Went here on a whim
Good basic Italian fare, family sizes and single portion
Very good value compared to other places with similar ambience
Spacious, pleasure to sit there, service very attentive
Had the rigatoni broccoli rabe with sausage and garlic sauce and fried calimari
No complaints
This place is good
The food is consistent, the place is bright and works well for groups
They do have single orders too which comes in handy if you are a couple or a single
I usually take people from out of town here, and have not been disappointed
They have delivery service too
The portions are not quite as large as the restaurant might have you believe; however, they are sufficient as long as you order one entree per person, which in some ways defeats the purpose of family style
Overall, the food wasn't special, but it was still good food
The service was decent, and the prices are not too unreasonable
Overall, it's worth a try
We ordered linguine with clam sauce
The pasta was not cooked properly

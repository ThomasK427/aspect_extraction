Well, ther lounge was lovely
The food was not
The falafel was ok, but a sauerkraut-like topping was not welcome (nor requested)
The hummus was tasteless beige paste
I will continue to patronize Ceasar's Falafel and hope the style of Chickpea doesn't edge out the superior food down the street
It's about time someone did it right!! No more lousy, fall apart in your hand sandwiches sold out of dirty, hole in the wall falafel joints
It seems someone finally understands that inexpensive food doesn't have to look and taste cheap
Eat in or get your meal delivered-- either way you get it quick and fresh
Thank god for chickpea
I am hooked
After many years of searching the world for the finest falafel, finally, chickpea has the very best there is to offer
Their falafel is very fresh and the friendly service makes you feel instantly like a regular
Amazing falafel! A must have!
This place is so good! I've had their salad (the kind where you choose the ingredients), split pea soup, shawarma, and falafel
They are all really good--chicken is very flavorful and falafel is very moist
They bake their own pita bread, which is amazing, and they even have whole wheat
Hummus is wonderful too
In fact, I'm going there right now! MMM!
The Scene Deep-orange sponge-painted walls combined with bright red overhead lights give a cave-like feel to the long, narrow space
An ancient-looking mosaic overlooks the dim bar, as couples and neighborhood denizens linger for hours over liquor and snacks
The calm pace of the service facilitates slow, relaxed dining
The Food This is a meyhane, the Turkish version of the tapas bar concept, so a seemingly endless parade of small plates serves as a complete meal
Crisp, pan-fried anchovies, pastry "cigars" filled with salty cheese and mussels stuffed with a savory rice mixture titillate
A marvelously rich yogurt crops up in various contexts: as a garlicky dip, dressing spicy wilted spinach and swathing a perfectly poached egg
For those who prefer a more substantial plate, entrees are available, including a fine grilled lamb loin served with lamb kidney, and a succulent choice of whole grilled or fried fish
Every time I go to this place, I end up staying all night! They have different lineup of musicians and dancers that are listed on the calendar on their website
I highly recommend it!!! Food is really good, too
They also have an extensive selection of wine and alchol as well
although I'm not a good judge, cause I don't drink
i highly recommend this place youll have the time of your life
its such a unique and diffrent exprience I loved it!!
ur never gonna want to leave!
One of the great spots in manhattan
Quality entres, great customer service, hospitality like at home, and live entertainment
They bring live bands, dancers and djs to make your night a fun night
Would definitely recommend it
excellent food as well as great live music
very multicultural have people from all customs dancing all night
great place to have in the city
It was a good place to have dinner and enjoy the good music!  Tuesday was a bad experience with loud arabic keyboard music
I heard that owner change
Place looks like more hookah bar now
I hope we wont miss old maia
Excelant food and not just that I lafe at 4:30 Pm the live music and DJ was outstanding it was a fun night
I read the other reviews and I guess you have to call first to find out if it's a special music night
But if it is, this is the best damn bar in New York
I saw the Russian Gypsy Folk Dance on a Saturday night and it was a blast
Beautiful dancer, graceful and full of mischief---nothing better than dance to go with your drinks
Dance floor tunes (Balkan fusion? crypto-Egyptian funk?) were cookin', and women who had bellydance moves were working out with each other
And then there were these two guys who did that crossed-arms-kicking-legs Russian folkdance thing
Egyptian cabaret-style bellydancer too
Big, big fun
I did find parking easy and i had the best time
staff are grat
Food is grat Live Band every night also on Fridays live band and at midnight DJ
Got there after 10pm, the music was great, food great, service excellent
We were a group of 15 people
The vibe was excellent - nobody wanted to sit down we danced the entire eveing
Open till 4am - Highly Reccommend
In Short Founded by staff of the late, lamented Iso, which long occupied the same prime corner location, Kanoyama continues its predecessor's legacy of popular, stylish sushi
Rose-hued track lighting overhead casts a pleasing glow on the small, spare room
In addition to a large and distinctive assortment of daily sushi and sashimi, a la carte or in combinations, the kitchen offers dishes like sake-marinated black cod, sliced duck with scallions, and "sea foie gras" made with monkfish liver
this place looks good from the outside and had a good zagat rating (25), so my friend and i decided to give it a try
we went relatively early (around 7pm), but the place was already about 85% full
its very small and the seating is pretty cramped
they have 3 sushi chefs lined up at the sushi counter and 2 cute waitresses for the entire place
they have an early bento box special daily before 7:30 mon-wed before 7:00 thur-sun, so we both decided to try that
for $13, you get to choose either the 5pc sushi bento, 5pc sashimi bento, eel bento, or omakase bento
we both blanched at the omakase choice for yesterday (chicken wings), opted for the sashimi bento
each bento comes with miso soup, rice, choice of shrimp tempura/vegetable tempura/grilled salmon, and dessert
my friend chose the shrimp, i chose the salmon
the miso soup arrived after about 15 minutes
we slurped it down and then our wait began
it must have been at least 45 minutes before our bento boxes arrived
the sashimi was very fresh and tasty, but there wasnt much of it
my main dish, the salmon, was dry and overcooked
everything was presented nicely the rice was even shaped into a star before being sprinkled with black sesame but i was very disappointed with the taste of the food
my friends tempura was fine, but we both were sad that we waited 45 minutes for very average food
granted, maybe they skimp on the quality (it was only $13), but if the good items are considerably more expensive, they shouldve gotten rid of the cheap options altogether, instead of allowing them to sully the restaurants reputation
dessert was a small cup of tart orange gelatin with a dollop of whipped cream
it was alright
the bill came to about $16pp, which is cheap, but i would rather have paid more for better food
next time im in the east village, im sticking to yakitori or sobaya
Outstanding quality sushi for very reasonable prices
In fact, overall one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to (better than Bond St, Tomoe)
I had the omakase sushi which extremely well done
The conger eel is actually prepared fresh there unlike many other sushi restaurants in the city
The fish is prepared nicely, portions were generous but not like brazenly large like at Yama
One of the most standout parts of the meal was the miso soup: flavorful, almost had a smokey taste to it
Definetely a new favorite for me
Full of flavor
Unique combos
Great sake list
Nice staff, and not too, too pricey
If I wasn't fearful You can live off of the appetizer menu
Just go down the list
It got all messed up with a few name changes and whatnot, but the place has settled in and it should do well
When youre through, have a drink at Veloce next door
Its a nice evening
$12 Early Dinner

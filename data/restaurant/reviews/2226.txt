extremedly friendly
the music, i mean everything is unique
im sure if you try you come back
One of my friends told them it was my birthday and the staff relally surprised me when their came to me singing with the mexican hats and a dessert with a candle on it
Also their take a picture that was sent to my email
Something else??? Well, just come and check it out
Its the best Mexican Restaurant around
As mexican, coming to El Azteca, it's like being at home, where all the traditions are presents in every visit to this restaurant
Great way to show to others our culture;chips,salsa,margaritas,music and more
The staff is extremly friendly and helpfull
Try, you will love it
A trip to El Azteca is like a trip home
It's not necessarily the best Mexican food around, but in New York City it's as authentic as you can get on a small budget
The staff is extremely friendly and the margaritas are strong without sacrificing flavor
It's dimly lit and relaxing and is a great place to head after work or on a Sunday afternoon
I love El Azteca!
Great service, decent prices, nice atmosphere
Food was nothing special
Did not taste very authentic
We were a little disappointed
this is a great place to get the night started at, a couple of those jumbo margaritas when the mariachi band is playing is almost an evening out on the town by itself, especially if you are going with Otis
My husband and I went on Cinco de Mayo
We had reservations and were taken care of greatly! The service was wonderful, the food was good
And the frozen margaritas were great too! I can't say enough about the service, they were so friendly!
El Azteca is the best Mexican restaurant in Hells Kitchen
Great food and AMAZING margaritas!  Take your friends for happy hour and dinner
it's a great time!
Frozen Margaritas are cool and delicious and the staff adds the warmth while delivering the wonderful shrimp quesadillas
Happy Hour is friendly and popular with half price frozen drinks, and crisp chips and fresh salsa
You'll wanna hang here and bring your friends!
The Margaritas were nice delicious with 3 different sizes and many flavours
I had the enchilladas mole and it was great; but nothing unusual, I like enchiladas mole where ever I eat
The porportion was just right, and the rice and beans were on a seperate plate
Overall, I enjoyed the experience very much because of its ambience
Go check it out for a night with friends
Good neighborhood place
The salsa is great, margaritas are perfect and the fajitas have just the right spice, they're delicious! Being from Texas myself, it's nice to know someone up here knows how to make good mexican food
This restaurant was beyond our expectations
We went with a group of 15 women who love to have a nice meal
The waiters went out oftheir way to meet our dinign needs
the food was outstanding and it did not break the pocketbook even with acouple of glasses of wine
Highly recommended
Make reservations if you are a group of 4 or more
Fills up quickly after a play
I eat here frequently because the food and service are consistently terrific
Restaurant is small but not cramped
Thin-crust pizza is yummy but I generally opt for the chicken, fish or pasta dishes
My favorite is the chicken parmesean -- I know


so mundane -- but Rino's take on the comfort-food classic is perfect
Chicken is moist and not overwhelmed by the sauce and cheese
I usually ask for an angel hair pasta side instead of potatoes and veggies
Ambience is not elegant but, for me, the food and service win out over mood lighting and hip flower arrangements
Probably one of the most underated places in NYC
Fantatsic thin crust pizza and great chicken, veal and pasta dishes
Service is very attentive; this place can't be beat; go and you won't be disappointed!
We ate here after seeing a play recently and we were very happy with the food, service, atmosphere and price
Conveniently located near Theater District, it was one block away from Neil Simon Theater
Small restaurant, open to street on 8th avenue
I had Filet Mignon, my daughters had pasta and caesar salads
My wife had swordfish and salad
I had two glasses of wine
Cost $110
Can't beat it
Everything about Rino Trattoria was excellent
We had several special requests and they were handled perfectly
The food, service, and size of the resturant were perfect
Very clean and comfortable
We are looking forward to our next visit
I have eatten at this location 15 times and each time the service and quality of the food has been great
We eat here all the time
It was so hard for us to find a good, cheap italian restaurant without travelling all the way down to little italy
Rino is it for us
It is VERY difficult to find a good, affordable, clean restaurant in this area, but I stumbled across this gem and will stick by it
The food was absaloutely delicious
It wasent perfect, but I have paid 3-4 times more on the same food at even more luxirious restaurants
Decor was fare
Simple, not pretentious at all
Okay, so they didnt shop at Target, instead they went to Kmart
Service was very friendly
The salad was good, but the bread was perfect
Warm, soft, fresh
Recommended Italian eatery in NYC fer sure!
I love this place
The food is great ! You get so much food for your money it's always good
I usually get take out so I am not sure about the service, but they are so nice quick whenever I order
I have seriously become addicted find myself craving it even though I had it the night before
Try the lamb kafta boulanee pumkin, or meat samosa
Our waitress (older, red hair and glasses) was extremely rude
She disregarded questions and comments we had about the menu like she couldn't be bothered
It took a long time to get our food, and my steak could have been warmer
She didn't check back with us once, and I had to track her down to get the check
I also needed my leftovers to go, and she forgot or just ignored me
I finally asked the host to take care of it, and he put them in a Dagastinos bag that smelled like fish (I had steak)
Also, one person wanted a table for one, and the host (Shawn) wouldn't seat him in the dining room and told him to sit at the bar
The guy walked out, which I should've done from the start
I've been here many many times and tried just about everything on the menu
The quality of the food is top notch
The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the chicken wings

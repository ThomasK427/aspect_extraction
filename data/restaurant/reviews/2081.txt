But the service was not very attentive or friendly
We're were disappointed since the food is good but the service was lousy
Great place for a date or to just have a mean before heading out to paint the town red! Very interesting menu with eclectic combinations, a slight southamerican touch and great desserts! Very cute location and ambiance, and a great wine selection! The service comes with a smile!
Good is
well, much better than good, actually
The food is taste, inventive and surprisingly affordable
The service is helpful, friendly and never snooty
A great choice for dinner with friends who are on a budget, or even those who aren't
The burgers are great, as are the fish entrees
Decor is simple, but it works well
Delicious food, best brunch around- try the homemade doughnuts! The service is always friendly and you never leave hungry
Went there on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly empty
However, the food was excellent and inexpensive, the staff was friendly and they had creative cocktails
I would go back
I'm surprised how many people loved Good -- we were a bit disappointed at brunch
The bread basket was the best food we were served--home made donuts, scones, etc
Everyone at the table seemed disappointed in their entrees
I had some eggs on vegetable hash concoction, which was more like bland sauteed chopped veggies than interesting veggie hash browns (which I was hoping for)
The Scene Thanks to an expansion into the storefront next door, the restaurant is twice the size it was when it opened in 1997
No matter--it's still always packed with happy neighbors, casual daters and friends catching up
Proof of the general conviviality of the place: Seats at the bar are most coveted
The Food Seafood lovers will have a hard time ordering the wrong thing--it's all done just right
Start with fried oysters, served atop a spot of homemade tartar sauce inside the oyster shells
Offered as an entree, perfectly caramelized seared scallops make a fine starter as well
The bouillabaisse is fine, though it's a bit too mussel-filled; a bowl of steamed clams in butter-clam-wine broth is better
The lobster roll can't be missed--chef and owner Rebecca Charles still makes the best one in town
Dessert-- homey, seasonal pie or cobbler--rounds out the meal perfectly
There isn't a question about it
I've eaten at all the big lobster roll joints in NYC, and while lobster rolls are never bad, they're at their best at Pearl
HUGE chunks of perfect lobster smothered in their special mayonnaise
It is no coincidence I chose this place to be the dinner on the night I proposed to my wife
I got her so giddy with the delicious food that she actually said Yes
The fries are quite good, the beer and wine are nice, and I understand the seafood is quite delicious
But, c'mon
If you're coming here and you don't at least try the lobster roll, you're almost as crazy as that reviewer who thought it had too many chunks of lobster
Well, actually it's a tie
Mary's Fish Camp has a terrific lobster roll as well, and a really cool atmosphere
Attention Lobster Roll Bashers: Unless you are a fan of the traditional, New England Lobster Roll, or Lobster meat in general, you will probably not be wowed by Pearl Oyster Bar
However, if you are like me, and LOVE lobster, and crave a good lobster roll, then this place is The Best
I just got a L
R
in Hoboken (Brass Rail, $18) and it absolutely paled in comparison
Pearl's rocks
I'm sorry gc315, but I have to take issue with anyone who thinks a lobster roll filled with just lobster chunks is a bad thing
I'm not missing the oodles of celery and other amorphous ingredients most places use as fillers to plump their otherwise limp rolls
The point of the fabulous Pearl lobster roll is that the texture, consistency, and flavor is so perfect you don't need the fillers
It's like an entire lobster tail in each roll
As a lobster lover, I will never complain about having to eat too many tasty chunks of lobster! Pearl is a can't miss for a delicious, casual seafood meal
The prices are actually pretty low for a great meal in the city and I've made friends while waiting in line at 5pm for this place to open at 6!
The last review by Alxsuh was right on the dot
The place didn't wow me
I heard a lot of hype about their Lobster Rolls but when I tried it I thought it was just lobster chunks in mayo on a roll
I've had better tuna sandwiches
There was nothing special about it
I thought maybe it was just my preference
So the next time I went, I ordered a broiled whole lobster which is how I like it
The lobster was not very fresh or tasty
No wonder they make lobster rolls! Their clam chowder was just that
clam chowder
Not too tasty, not horrible, but I've had better
Their food is a little bland and doesn't have too much seafood flavor
The part that cinches the deal with this place is that prices are rather high and so is the wait
Heard so much about it so it did not live up to it's expectations but alas I think I'm starting to catch onto to a theme for rating restaturants
The scene always trumps the food
As long as the food is decent and nothing to write anything negative about, the scene is what makes or breaks the place
Don't get me wrong, the lobster roll was fine, but all it is is steamed lobster in mayo on a roll
Compared to cheap lobster roll joints up in New England, here, they use a good roll and good quality mayo, so it is quite good
But it's just a lobster roll
you can't really screw it up, nor can you really make it outstanding
The clam chowder was , again, good but nothing memorable
Just good
The scene staff are very nice as well
The price is TOO STEEP however
The line begins to form outside half an hour before opening time but it's well worth the wait
The lobster rolls are superb, and so is the grilled fish
Dessert is good too, but my fiance and I've managed to eat dessert here only once or twice in all the years - we're usually too full for dessert after the meal
I had been meaning to dine at Pearl Oyster Bar for a while but was intimidated by the no-reservations / long-lines rumors
Taking a stroll downtown today, my boyfriend and I happened upon a line that was half a block long
It turns out the restaurant was 15 minutes away from opening (at 6pm) and devoted diners were willing to wait it out
We joined the line and weren't disappointed
Almost fast-food-esque in its ambience and service (we sat at a counter which was fun!), we found this place to be perfect for a casual dinner
Food came out fast - we started with an unbelievably delicious New England clam chowder (served with bacon!) and chowed down on the incredible lobster rolls: best ones we've ever had! We walked out the door only about 40 minutes later - completely satiated
A must try!
i've eaten at pearl for years
i refuse to try marys fishcamp
i refuse to commit to the expanded room (although its great!)
im addicted
i arrive at 5:45pm (in the existing line) and wait patiently for the floodgates to open
we (2) sit at the bar (as usual) this evening, order a bottle of wine, we only had 2 apps and shared a lobster roll, whatever
everything was rushed out to us as if they wanted us to eat and go
i've worked in restaurants for 10 (min) years and i've never rushed a paying customer out of my restaurants (w exceptions known to other chefs w/out going into detail)
ok, i'm rambling
, years of great experiences at pearl
allow people to finish their meal in peace and in good time bcause most of them understand and arent camping out (no pun)
keep up the good food, just allow us time to eat it
thanks
As we wondered around the Village on a warm Friday afternoon in search of a lunch spot we found the Pearl
We were seated immediately and informed that the kitchen closed in 10 minutes but we could take as long to eat as we wanted
We opted for a lobster roll and the salted shrimp
The lobster roll was to die for full of lobster chunks and a delicious sauce

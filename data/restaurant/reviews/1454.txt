A friend and I walked in one spring night and were very plesantly surprised
Initimate ambiance, super nice wait staff and great food
Alejandro, the chef, is a very generous and accommodating man indeed
After noticing my delight at discovering some Mexico City street food classics on the menu, he began to ply us with carnitas, esquites and mole just delivered by his mum
We ate like stoned raggamuffins
Very inventive margeritas; El Diablo is not, really
Just a lively spice in the mouth while being quite refreshing
If you are a vegan like my dining companion, not a problem at all
Just tell Alejandro in whatever language you speak
All very friendly folks present
El Bocadito is an intimate restaurant with few tables able to sit 5 comfortably, but dont let the size stop you from tasting their Top-Notch Margaritas, Chilaquiles and Guacamole and Chips
I had the Martini-style Margarita with Brazilian Berries which was great
The guacamole was freshly made and served with a different style of chips (sort of a crisp tortilla, but not really)
Lastly, I had the Chilaquiles prepared in a way that left me breathless (my friend had to tell me to stop eating so that I can breathe)
The menu stated it was soft corn tortillas with greens salsa, lettuce, cheese and sour cream
While it is hard to find on this ever so growing Orchard Street, El Bocadito offers great food that doesnt leave a dent in your pocket
Great new spot, hiden by the construction next door was worth discovering
Small place full of flavor, laid back easy going, the service was prompt and attentive
Go for the specials of the day, love the regulars but the daily specials were tastier and really fresh, Highly recommend the fish tacos and the margaritas, the guac/chips were great, not your regular chips, but a bigger guac portion would not hurt, very tasty though
Fast service, should add more desserts to the menu
Don't expect your average mexican, this is above the regular mexican place
Great modern mexican music
I work nearby, so tried it with some coworkers (three times now since it opened in January)
I moved from LA about 7 months ago (the land of Mexican food) and I have to say I thought this place was as good if not better than any place I've tried in LA
I had the special Chilaquilas (sp?) which I think are on the menu now - AWESOME - definitely check those out
My friends really dug the portabello mushroom quesadilla
The nachos rock
Definitely check out the Seabass taco special (they had it both times I went recently) too
Great food
Great music, too - some cool mexican? electronic stuff
I was happy to find this spot walking down Orchard Street amidst all the construction
We only had a couple drinks and a few snacks, but I'd like to come back for a meal
The margaritas were fresh and wonderful and the few things we tried hit the spot
Everything was tasty and simple
There is a nice vibe going on there - I'd come back
I am a regular at El Bocadito and have gone with friends there 3 times
Love it
It is set up to have more than one plate and that is what we do: start with a drink and the guac/chips, then have a main course, then a salad
The food is delicious but what is also appealing is the warm local vibe
A lot of people who live on the street seem to go there solo (sit/eat at the bar)
Posters on this site may have been expecting the standard large restaurant plate, but the restaurant name means a little bite in Mexican
My friends and I use it either to wrap up an hour exploring in the Lower East Side neighborhood, or to kick one off
Tip: sit at the bar, convival
I was very disappointed in this restaurant
When I first arrived I was excited to try the food and enjoy some cocktails in the cozy and warming little space
Unfortunately, the menu was misleading and the cocktails took forever to arrive
The food was terrible
The service was awful
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone
Me and my 4 friends had to leave and grab pizza after this meal
Before going to El Bocadito I read the review of Dailycandy and the reviews on Citysearch
Only one other reviewer found the food unimpressive, and as it turns out - he/she was right
The spot is small, which is fine, the menu is unexciting, also fine, but the food is absolutely tasteless
We had a variety of items off the menu, and only two were really enjoyable - the nachos and the picikled vegetables - everything else was unimpressive
It seems as tho the staff at El Bocadito are intersted in doing a good job, but the food is very far off
the atmosphere is cute, laid back and the food is excellent! NY has so many great restaurants but very rarely do I come across a good mexican one
The tortas are phenomenol as are the nachos and guac
I have been 2 times now with different people and everyone has loved it
the food is reasonably priced and great for sharing
no liquor license when i went but we were able to bring in a bottle of wine
the staff is cool with no lower eastside attitude
great place to go with a small group of friends
The food was spectacular
Everything was so tasty! My friend and I went and ordered each of the entrees and a special appetizer of the day
It felt like I was in a little cafe in Mexico! The restaurant is tiny, so be prepared to wait when word hits the streets about this little hidden place! The service was attentive but not overly so, and when I went they didn't have a liquor license, but the waitress said they were in the process of getting one
I highly recommend this place to any and all who love mexican food!
The food is terrible! The chorizo taco is just a chopped up hot dog in a tortilla
We also had a cold chicken taco which lacked everything but chicken
The guacamole at $7 is a small portion served with a stack of Si!Ortega flat taco shells
If you want a meal you'll have to order 3 tacos, and at $5 a pop you're spending at least $20 per person for a generic and bland marked-up take on what is ordinarily a simple and classic Mexican dish
the food is incredibly BLAND, period
we left unsatisfied and went around the corner for a real meal
$30 bucks down the tube
We ate here the opening weekend and were floored by the wonderful service, tasty nibbles and all-around fun atmosphere
This isn't your typical Mexican dive - it has gourmet street food like the mouthwatering chorizo tacos
Yum yum! Great neighborhood, cool space, nice staff
Highly recommend!
The specials by the entry may make it look like they're in constant need of business, but if that's the case, it's not because of the food
The food is tasty, although not enough to stand head and shoulders above other restaurants
The prices are in-line - an average meal for two will probably run you about $50-60, not including alcohol
With the recent Mega-Japanese restaurant invasion, one can easily forget about reasonably priced, god quality Japanese restaurants
If you want to eat good sushi without a fuss, go to Fukumatsu
Good sake selection
Food from the kitchen is good also if not superb
Fukumatsu is a hidden gem
I've eaten dinner here quite a few times and the sushi/sashimi has been very fresh on every occasion
I like their special rolls, they are somewhat more expensive but not too pricey
Dinner for two won't cost more than 60 to 70 dollars
Fukumatsu is every bit as good as other better known places and far less expensive
The atmosphere is great and intimate
The service was phenomenal
The wait staff was very attentive to all of our needs
And I enjoyed the best kiwi martini I have ever had! Highly recommended!!
Delicious food!! Good sushi, good entrees
The service was adequate though we did need to keep asking for water and the drinks from the bar took a long time- plus the restaraurant was not crowded
the only annoying part i s that the music was on a 3 song repeat and we heard Santana and bob marley over and over and over and over
We arrived on the early side (7:30) so it was empty
Seated promptly
Received perfect service
Started with some drinks, organic riesling, mojitos all great

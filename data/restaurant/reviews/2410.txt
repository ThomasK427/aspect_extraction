Lacking in knowledge of the menu and slow to answer question or take orders, there are better spots to go
I love this place! Great value, great food
Fish is excellent, try out the parmigian dishes
While there is usually a wait at the bar due to a no reservations policy, you will be rewarded
Great pastas and fish, plus meats, antipasti, and wonderful salad with salad parmesiano on top
The house Chianti is very drinkable and at under $4 a glass, worth imbibing in
The decor is clean, nostalgic, and very comfortable
No parties more than 4 though
Busy little Italian on the Upper East Side with better than average food at reasonable prices
Veal Parmegiana was outstanding and fish dishes were better than average
You can have a nice glass of wine, salad, and entree and dessert and get out for $50-60 for two
Good food at fair prices! What a concept!!
Although their service isn't the greatest, I keep going back to this restaurant
Unlike many popular Japanese restaurants use cheap instant Miso soup mix with MSG or Amino Acid, they seem to make their miso soup from scratch or use higher quality instant Miso soup mix
If you would like to enjoy simple familial Japanese/Okinawan food, this is a great place to dine
If you would like popular Japanese food like sushi or sashimi, go somewhere else
I do have to agree with other reviews that the service is not great
when the restaurant is too busy with a big group of Japanese customers, you wouldn't get any attention and the service becomes untorelably slow
you could be told most of the menu items are no longer available even at 6 PM
if you don't mind slow service and limited selections on the menu occasionally, then you might consider dining there
at least, food is decent
the pricing is not that great though
Service was slow, haphazard and mistakes were made without any concern for the guests
Our courtesy and patience only seemed to encourage their persistent rudeness and lackadaisical nonservice
There were only 4 other tables so it wasn't as if they were swamped
We still gave a little over the standard 15% tip but be forewarned that 15% is mandatory at this restaurant
We learned this as we were leaving because the waiter misread the credit card receipt and demanded that we make up the difference
The food was mediocre to average
I felt like I had wandered into the overpriced branch of Go Sushi
We passed this place just wandering by, and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food
Pizza by the slice along with other Italian favorites are available at this quick service eatery
You can eat there in a small dining area or take it to go
Be careful, the Pizza by the slice is heated HOT
Many people were asking to not heat it so much so they could eat sooner rather than wait
Also tried their Spaghetti with Sausage, this was a nice treat! Over all, a good eating experience
The Scene Hunky waiters dub diners "darling" and it sounds like they mean it
The odors emanating from the kitchen smell like mom's (only better) and you know she would approve of the dark blue glasses juxtaposed against pristine white tablecloths
The dim orange lighting and pale yellow walls create a relaxing ambience
The Food Cannelloni melts in the mouth and grilled pork chops are juicy and tender, yet the sides are often more savory than the entrees
A timbale of potatoes, white beans and goat cheese is extraordinary, and the creamy polenta gratin appetizer is so thick and rich it constitutes a whole meal
The seafood dishes are iffy: On a not-so-fresh day the crab cake is disappointing
Desserts are tasty
I love this place
It's a perfect venue for business lunches: the southern Italian fare is very good (albeit not incredible), the service is friendly and the restaurant is always crammed with various captains of industry and media types
I particularly enjoyed the flat bread salad
Within 10 minutes of being seated at our table, the hostess asked us if we could move
Ive dined any many upscale restaurants and not once was I ever asked to move to another table to accommodate guests
Not only was it rude but completely unprofessional
We politely agreed to move and the hostess offered us a round of drinks on the house (took 20 minutes to arrive)
Another 30 minutes had passed and our main course did not arrive
The hostess stopped by and asked if everything is ok, I replied Obviously, no
We have yet to be served and our waitress has disappeared
Within 10 minutes of the complaint, we got our food
Not once did our waitress stop by our table
We asked for the check and decided not to leave a tip as NO SERVICE was provided
I would NEVER dine at Frescos again
We went out with a few clients
About 10 of us
8 of us didn't like it
We felt we didn't get the promised authentic Italian favors
Though the service was good
Really nothing special
They waitresses got talent
Great food, amazing service
Yummy!! The pasta was al dente and the marinara was great
Try the delicious crab cakes
During the snowstorm in Jan 2005 - we walked into Fresco - obviously not dressed appropriately due to the weather conditions and it didn't matter to Mrs
Scotto - her grace and welcoming comments were not what you normally hear/see in NY
We were absolutely delighted with our waiter, the food was phenomenal (try the chicken veal with penne bolognese)
Will absolutely go again when we are in town
City search reates this as good for a group setting
Well I just called the special events co-ordinator and she was so rude to me
When I asked what the price per person was she told me and just asked can you even afford this
I told her probably and then began to ask her if there were any other fees, as in for the private room, she intterupted me and said no there are no other options
She obviously didn't want our patronage at all and I can't see how they get anyone to pay $75 per person for such bad customer service
If you are looking to have a group event this is not the place to do it
If you've been to Italy, you are aware that most Italian food in NY tastes distinctly American
Not so at Scotto
I thought I was back in Mama Italia
Every single thing we ordered, fromt the salad, to the rabbit, porkchop, pasta, and dessert was too good
Yes, a bit expensive, but if you are willing to shell it out, this is a great place to do so
This was my first visit, so I can't comment on consistency, but I'm certainly willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, and will definitely return
The service was also very friendly and recommended a wonderful bottle of wine (we had 3 of them
)
This is a great place to meet clients for lunch
The risotto is one of the best in the city
The location is so convenient to mid-town
We were extremely disappointed with the atmosphere and service at this restaurant
The only good thing was the food which was WAY overpriced and not much to choose from
Everything was good- the fresh peach iced tea, the rabbit, the polenta I had and the entire staff and care we had,
We had last minute dinner ploans, and glad we came here
Pricey, but if someone else is picking up the tab-come here!!
I'm very satisfied with the quality of food, service and atmosphere of Fresco
Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it to treat yourself once in a while with an awesome dining experience
If I have to say something negative about the place, it would be the wait
We made reservations, but we still had to wait over 30 minutes for our table
Perhaps that goes to show how wonderful Fresco is with its overfilled dining room
An unfortunate and disappointing experience
Took whole family for my father's birthday
It was his last visit to NYC (he had cancer) and I wanted to make this special

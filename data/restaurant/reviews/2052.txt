The waiter, who was serving our table, was very stuck-up and unfriendly
Nobody would come and suggest pouring water in our glasses
We waited for our dessert for 45 minutes! The place was crowded and loud
I had to lean to hear what my fiance was saying
We went there, expecting to have one of the most romantic dinners, and came out very upset and disappointed
This place really does a great job to make you feel special
the candle is lit when u sit down, the roses are fresh on the table
The waiter and the people at the front cater to your every need
The food is amazing
Everything was perfect
I love when you go somewhere and you take a sip of water and they refill ur glass
Very attentitive service
I will definately be revisting this place very soon
Dinner for 2 people with one drink(boyfriend doesn't drink) was 210 with tip
not including the 35 bucks for parking garage
Very reasonable considering the high quality
Perfect evening
Just a warning to all who are looking for a quiet romantic restaurant - KEEP LOOKING
There was an actual sing-a-long complete with some slobbering drunk unrulypeiple
They were singing and cursing and belching all night
Management was encouraging it and completely ignored our complaints
I have made reservations two weeks prior to my one year anniversary, requesting a table by the window in the main dining room
When me and my sweetheart have arrived we where promptly seated at the requested table
The ambiance was unbelievable; so romantic so authentic and charming, everything was just ideal
The place had a stunning effect on me and my darling
The service was fine
The food was exquisite and scrumptious
That night I have tasted the finest apple martinis, and I know martini
The price is great value for special occasions
I and my sweetie loved it and I was very pleased with my choice
My boyfriend and I went on Sunday night for our anniversary and I found it to be the perfect place to go for a beautiful night out
We are twenty somethings so I expected to be treated with less respect, as usually happens in nice restaurants, but the hostess seated us in a prime table right by a window, the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and even the bus boys were funny
We had a fabulous time - the food was excellent, though not the best I've ever had
wine list was large and not as pricey as expected
We sat down at 9 and did not leave until after midnight and were not rushed at ALL
It was worth the money in the end, because of the good mix of food and ambiance
I would go there again, and reccommend it to anyone who wants a very special night out
After reading some negative reviews, I was skeptical about going to this place
But my mood has changed the minute the four of us stepped into this romantic historic-looking restaurant with candles, flowers, and multiple fireplaces
We were greeted at the entrance and seated right away in on the main floor
The waiter was great and very helpful with multiple reccomendations
The pre-fix menu price was $63 which I think is reasonable considering the portions were large and delicious
The wine list starts from $60 up
The bill came to $450 with tip for four people
This was a wonderful experience and the place is absolutely romantic
The piano man is awesome and plays everyone's favorite tunes
I would go there again in a heartbeat and would reccomend it to everyone who wants to have a great wonderful evening
After making reservations 1 month ahead, they sent us to the bar when we arrived, you know to get you out some extra bucks because they had available tables at the moment
The food was good, but certainly over-hyped as a romantic place
Very dark, loud and crowded
I dont mind spending heavily in restaurants, but this was not cheap yet did not impressed us
We are not to hard to please, but would not go again
There are far better choices in the city
We had an amazing special occasion dinner there on 10/07/03
I had read a number of very negative reviews on line, which I can only conclude were from people who are not accustomed to eating in restaurants of this caliber
The food was more creative than we expected
There was a special green pea soup with truffles and lobsters which was ethereal
Our main courses were perfect
Although we were first time visitors, we were given our pick of wonderful tables
The ambiance is unparalleled, and the service was polite and friendly
The wine list has serious bottles but also good values
With a splurge bottle of wine, our bill was $268, very reasonable in comparison to other fine restaurants in NY
My boyfriend took me there for my birthday last night
It was absolutely wonderful! Not only was the food orgasmic, but I can honestly say I have never had a better waiter in my life
Everything was perfect and the it was the best birthday I've ever had
Went for our anniversary
Service was awful
Brought the wrong bottle of wine and never apologized
No refills on water
Waiter dropped check on table while I was in the middle of handing my wife her anniversary present
Very, very disappointing
Dinner was ok
Not the best meal I've ever had but the food was good, better than average
the piano music was lovely
My biggest complaints are about the staff
We had a waiter that had breath so bad it could kill a cat
The other problem we had was with the Host/Maitre'D
When we checked in he couldn't find our reservation and then mumbled something under his breath about the bar
We asked him to repeat himself and he got very nasty
We waited at the bar for 15 minutes to be seated when the restaurant was only half full
This ruined our evening
I was seated promptly, even after getting there 30 minutes late due to traffic
Placed at a nice table, the decor was very nice, although there was loud conversations
the prix fixe menus were given pretty prompty and a mini-app was brought out along with some bread
service was professional, although scarce
the appetizer (sea scallops and shrimp thai salad) were both very good, although the entrees were too salty
midway through the dinner, another couple was seated right next to us, although it didn't bother us
deserts were slow to order as waiters passed us twice, even with the menus closed
deserts were also slow to come
Overall, it was an enjoyable dinner, even with the many glasses of water drank
My dining experience there definitely started off on the wrong foot
My husband I had made reservations and we arrived on time
A hostess asked us to wait for an available table, which I had no problem with
However, 2 parties of 2 arrived about 10 minutes after we did and they were both seated immediately
When I confronted the hostess and asked her why we were not seated first, she tried to deny that she had seated anyone before us
When I persisted, she eventually mumbled an apology and we were then immediately seated in an area where there were several available tables
Otherwise, I thought the service was very good
the waiters and busboys were very attentive and gracious
The food was okay, but not worth the money
It's a romantic setting for a private dinner but unfortunately the mood can be spoiled by questionable service

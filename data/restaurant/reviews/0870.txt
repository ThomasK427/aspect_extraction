Enjoy!
I wandered in on a whim and discovered a new cuisine with strange but delicious mixes--had shrimp and artichoke hearts in a sauce inside an acorn squash
The waiters are chilled out and can explain the unfamiliar cuisine to you without making you seem ignorant
Went back later with my husband for our anniversary since they also do steaks to the hilt (with a salsa and some Brazilian fries) and we are a veggie/carnivore couple
Try this place and you won't be disappointed! The waiters want you to have a positive experience and will help you find a dish that suits your tastes; they make a point of providing a sampling of Brazilian favorites
a real cultural experience
Food is not bad for the price
The delivery boys make what could be a good deal a horrible experince
They demand extra tip
Will follow you back into office and demand more
Next they try to offer you free soda or rice (because you good customer)
Only order if you have exact change is the moral of the story
An excellent value lunch with the best fast service especially during lunch time for local deliveries
There is good variety of vegan as well as meat options with authentic Indian taste aroma,especially the methi chicken!They should be addding some more veges
Does'nt make me put on pounds,seems they don't use heavy cream at all
I would well recomend it people working or living here
Great local place, with a solid menu and good service
The menu has something for everyone, and the food is above average
We go there after events at the 92nd Street Y, or when meeting friends from the neighorhood
Have not been disappointed yet
Hidden gem in the Bronx for Yankee games
A slice of Manhattan in the Bronx
Great crowd and very clean place
Sandwiches were excellent and the staff is fun
Would recommend it to anyone going to a Yankee game
I'm from Jersey and this was my first time venturing to the Bronx
I wanted a taste of latin culture and food, so I went to El Museo del Barrio (recommended) and searched for Jimmy's Bronx cafe, which I never found, so I turned back to El Rey del Marisco and was pleaseantly surprised with the quality and presentation of the food
The service is very good
i had mofongo and it was quiet tasty
This place is bland
From the food to the 50's/60's Italian family decor
Its not bad per se, but just not worth the time
Used to be the restaurant arm of the Full Moon Pizzeria
I do not know if its the same owner, but it tastes no different
In my many travels up and down Italy I have not found A place with as good food as DiComo in the Bronx
Plus I saved the airfare
Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood in the Bronx, this Italian restaurant is everything you would expect from an upscale eatery in Manhattan
Make reservations and be prepared to EAT
Thy have a private room for large groups
This is an authentic Mexican place, frequented mainly by
Mexicans
The waitstaff is challenged to speak English, but happy to try!  I've only ever ordered one thing here
chilaquiles con pollo, with sausa verde
It's an incredible dish!
I had a decent meal at Tacu-Tacu
The service was nice, but I found the food a bit bland
My guests for the evening enjoyed their meals thoroughly, though, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing
I'm a big fan of fish, and their salmon morado (sp?) is really good
they serve some plantain chips too which are seasoned lightly with salt (yum)
ceviche isn't that good, i've had it better at The Spain Restaurant
Haven't ordered from their Asian side of the menu, but the Latin American side is great
This place is pretty cool to eat in
Nice seating arrangement for you to take in every visual the spot has to offer
I came twice, once with a couple folks, and the other time with a group of seven
Both times, my friends enjoyed themselves
Strangely enough, thye were playing HIP-HOP music (I listened to Kanye West's ENTIRE second album while eating)
The food service took a while (more time than I would considre appropriate), but the food is really decent
Went here for a birthday party and had a blast
From the waterfall entrance to the tiki-kitch walls of the place, Tacu Tacu is transporting
The bar scene here is lively
even at 8
Pretty stiff drinks, decent food
but the place is the real draw
Who would've thought they could pull off a Peruvian-Vietnamese thing
A botanical stream runs through the center of the dining room, which is mostly lit by candles
It's good for groups
A dozen of us were seated after a few minutes
We had privacy-but weren't isolated
There were many clusters of twentysomethings and a few families and couples there too, but I'd recommend this spot for groups
Bring a cane with you if you plan to go downstairs so you can hook the wannabe lounge lizzards off the karaoke floor
I sat on the tacu tacu side
and thought the food was great! The ambience was romantic
semi circle tables
that you can sit together with ur date!
A group of 7 of us went to dinner and left dissapointed
To be honest, we were waiting for a table at a different restaurant and were tired of waiting, so we slipped into tacu-tacu
The best parts about the place was we were seated promtly and the decor is fun
However, the food was yucky
the pu-pu platter was dried out and lacked flavor
They serve these massive plantains with most meals and they are so dry and like eating bricks
I like restaurants that offer two different types of food, but in this case, they should stick to one or the other
Service was a bit all over the place too
Not recommended, but if you stumble upon tacu-tacu, most likey your experience will just be mediocre-mediocre
Our family of four, ranging in age from 17 to 45 went to Maison Saigon Tacu Tacu for a diner
What a nice, warm and cozy restaurant
It has two sections in their menu Peruvian and Vietnamese
Its reflected in dcor as well
Two sides are separated by a huge fish tank and a bar
We ordered various appetizers, entrees and deserts
Everything was beautifully presented and delicious
Service was fast and attentive
There was no wait to be seated
Prices were right also
We had very enjoyable evening
Like a previous review, I like the Peruvian side better, but I believe both are exceptionally good (considering the price)
And down below at the Lulu Lounge, lot's of fun
Awesome bartenders (JC and AM) and friendly staff
If you aren't a Peruvian food connoiseur, you would probably dig this place, but if you are, or are just picky about your food in general, I do not recommend this place
Good food up top
great combo of Vietnamese and Peuvian food

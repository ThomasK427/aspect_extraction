I highly recommend this restaurant
conscious spenders beware!
Besides the fact that my group needed to remind the Maitre-D to bring the sparkling water 3 times, my group was taken for a joy ride! When presented with the wine list, we asked what bottle is recommended, and took him up on his choice
In addition to the wine had a vinegar-like aftertaste, what they failed to mention was that the wine bottle cost over $600! This is in addition to their $100+ pre-fixes and extra cost for miscellaneous drinks and souffls
When a bill for a party of 6 surpasses the $1,300 mark, (and some of the patrons are still hungry afterwards), you know that youve been takes to the cleaners!
Let us start off with the Maitred
They really need to hire a new one
He was like a little girl
Just a bit too good for himself, but to be nice he was nothing but arrogant and disrespectful
Having said that, the place looked fantastic
The service was excellent
The food needed to be a little more in potion, but the taste was above average
I have had better, but not many
I would recommend this place to anyone
Just don't get annoyed at the front door
For a restaurant of this caliber and reputation, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of service
Our party felt rushed to order, wine glasses were empty for some time before being refilled, we had to ask twice before getting someone to take our coffee order and our check was taken twice before we had a chance to even look at it
The food was OK - not as good as we expected
The atmosphere was very good - beautiful flower arrangements
Overall, I would not rush to return
I LOVED IT, PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE, DELICIOUS FOOD, GREAT SERVICE
BECAME MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT
The menu is expensive, but the food is worth it! Traditional French cuisine at its best! Their frog legs are the best I've had in the United States, maybe even in France and I'm a French native so I should know! Their breads and butter are so tasty, you have to resist to the temptation of eating too much before the order arrives
Their desserts are also excellent: where else can you enjoy such a perfect Ile flottante (a light and airy classic French dessert of milk-poached egg whites over a creamy custard topped with caramel)? Everything is so good, it's hard to keep a little space for the delicious Petit-Fours served with coffee or tea
When I get really homesick for top classic French cuisine, my prescription is La Grenouille
The trick is to go for lunch instead of dinner, the prix fixe menu costs half as much
I was so excited to go here until I was told the pre-fixe menu was something crazy like $95
When I was getting ready to spend a romantic dinner with my boyfriend I didn't realize I would be out of my league at this restaurant
This was a place for the richest families, I mean, even 7 year old children were wearing suits and dresses
I do have to say the food was very good
I got the lamp chops which were mediocre but the Lagostinos that my boyfriend ate were delicious
I was a little disappointed by the service too
Our waiter ask us what kind of soufle we wanted and told us to get 2, making us believe that it was part of the pre-fixe, nope soufles are seperate and we were so full from dinner we could barely finish one
And I didn't find it that romantic
I finally made it here
Very good food
Very friendly service
The air was filled with the smell of flowers
Just a note that the crowd is definitely older!
We wanted to go down memory lane and there we were dinning at La Grenouille! The service was horrific, waiters were so PUSHY! The frog legs were like small pieces of burned nuggets from a low and cheap fast food place
The clams were OVER salted
Our rack of lamb was not medium rare and had to be sent back
Wine was poured in our glasses by the waiters every 3 minutes
and worse
we had to pay a BIG bill
Great atmosphere
Wait staff a bit pretentious
Food excellent, a bit rich
with both a la carte and prix fixe menus, it is the best deal in town for magnificent food and service
The food is not bad, but I place large orders for my office and it is never delivered on time
Always deliver at least an hour late
I've tried ordering for at least a half hour earlier than I need the order and they are still late
They also make a lot of mistakes on the orders
The Scene Pescatore is really two restaurants sharing a common menu and kitchen
The first has a more formal feel with tablecloths, gilded mirrors and red velvet banquettes
At its counterpart one door uptown, a downtown decor of brick walls, wooden tables and sexy amber lighting attracts a younger set
The Food The Italian menu has almost-limitless variations on staple dishes, creating an offering that rivals a Chinese restaurant in its vast number of choices
The most pleasing dishes are often the most simple, like the beef carpaccio with Parmesan, pizza bianca and toothsome osso buco
Whatever you order, be sure to come hungry, as doggy bags seem to be the norm
But do save room for homemade ricotta cheesecake or tiramisu, both of which are very compelling
The food was very good, and our service was even better
We had pasta and seafood dishes, which were very good, but I would not classify them as outstanding
Next time, we will try fish entrees as that is the specialty
Loved the atmosphere as well
We will head back!
Whenever we are in the city for the day we eat at Pescatore
The service is great and the food is delicious
In the nice weather we love the balcony overlooking second ave and enjoy leisurely lunches
The New Zealand Mussels are our favorite and the ossubucco is tender and melts in your mouth
The newly renovated side of the restaurant was a great idea and the ambience is wonderful
The staff is very attentive and makes you feel like family
We recommend this restaurant highly to all our friends and family and have never been disappointed
What an underwhelming way to spend dinner
Wish we would have found somewhere where they know how to cook steak and seafood
The salmon carpaccio was just bland lox over a bed of unseasoned spinich, the NY strip steak was not a good cut of meat, the fish special, snapper, was tough and flavorless, and the key lime pie for dessert tasted like it was from a supermarket
On the upside, the waitstaff were friendly and attentive
We hated to complian at them, so just paid the bill and left, never to return
Six of us came for lunch on the company tab
we were seated on the 2nd floor balcony which was perfect for the sunny day
we started with the crispy bruschetta (piled with tomatoes onions) caprese (fresh mozzarella with very fresh tomato) as appetizers
afterwards, i had the grilled tuna ($18) served with bean salad
the huge tuna steak was very fresh and grilled rare according to my specifications
it was simply flavoured with salt, pepper, and lemon juice
the fish came atop a huge pile of bean (assortment of white, red, and string beans) salad marinated in a slightly spicy tomato-based sauce it complimented the steak very well
we sampled a few of the desserts
the homemade cheesecake was especially good (light airy)
the white chocolate mousse cake was pretty awful though very dry and dense
bill came to $220 including tip drinks
I went here for dinner after reading the reviews for this place
The people were nice and attentive
The menu had a good number of options
The calamari was a good portion and the lobster bisque was amazing
Try the halibut
And the tiramisu is a must
The value is excellent
Nothing really stood out here
The service was good and they were on point with us
The best thing we had here were the New Zealand muscles
it was the special
They were HUGE and came in this tastey spicey sauce

If you have a feast on Christmas Eve at your home this is the place for you
The food was delicious and even better was the service and atmosphere
If your family is originally from The Bronx or Brooklyn and have moved to the 'burbs over the years this is the place to get back together with the family
Bring an appetite
An unbelievable dining experience
The food is unparalleled
The service is Grandioso
And I say Bravo for the experience
In Short In nice weather, the front doors are flung open to the air; cold nights find patrons tucked into rear booths
The place is popular with locals
The food is a melding of Moroccan comfort food and Spanish tapas fare: tagines, stews and salads, with surprises like baby eggplants and olives where you might not expect them
Dishes are best shared with groups, as are the pitchers of sangria
At one point this place was tolerable
The food quality has gone downhill in the past 2 years
As far as the service, it is beyond bad
The waiters and managers are rude
You will wait forever to receive your order and do not even think about complaining! A group of friends and I were complaining amongst ourselves, how slow the service was
The snobby wanna be euro chic waitress proceeded to have our group kicked out! The manager's reason was I always side with my staff and your group was rude
The watiress had the gall to curse in french and throw a hand towel across the room as we left! There are better places in Soho to spend your money!
Always a fun place
the food is deeelish! The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap
Another great place to take out-of-towners! :)
Delicious food, nice vibe and good service
I recommend this place to anyone who likes to have a great time in soho
Good job guys @ noir
;-)
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!  The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from
maybe you dont know how things work in America
and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place
Three of us went to Cafe Noir on the hottest day of the summer last year
We were seated at a table where there was no ventillation at all
Upon using their bathroom (btw, don't) I found that the other side of the restaurant was air condtioned and there were a few empty tables
Before our food arrived I asked our waitress if we could be moved and she just stared blankly at me
I asked her again slowly and she said she needed to ask her manager
Why? I don't know because she never came back
By then our appetizers arrived and we just picked everything up and moved ourselves
We were so annoyed we ended up going somewhere else for dinner
Needless to say, our waitress didn't get a tip
I love SoHo and having a good time, but come here for drinks and then move on
Cafe Noir is a great place to go with friends or on a date
The food selection is vast and all of the tapas we tried were excellent
The Sangria is some of the best in the city
The only complaint I had was we went in early fall and it was a warm day but the restaurant did not turn on the air
My friends and I showed up on a Sat
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience
Bar was a little bit crowded, but these five girls know how to have fun!! it was a little hard to understand the waitress and she seemed to have little patience with our questions
We had to ask the manager and he was very helpful
Food was great and so was music! We will come back!!!
I love Cafe Noir because it is the perfect balance of an outdoor bohemian cafe and a soho-scene
The sangria and the mojitos are to die for and the staff is flaky but friendly
There is no place better on a humid summer night with friends
I used to love this place, but after last night I will never go there again
The food was awful, the service was even worse
The waiter was clueless, the food was overcooked, even the busboys were confused
This place used to have the best hanger steak in town but the only thing we found appealing was the water
I went with a large group on Friday night
we had a 9:30 reservation
We arrived at approximately 9:15 to have a drink at the bar
The bar was crowded with other people waiting to be seated for their reservations
It became impossible to stand and have a drink or any type of conversation
After waiting an hour and a half, we were finally seated at 11:00
Once seated, we ordered
the food came rather quickly and now I know why
it wasn't good
I had a blue cheese burger that was dry and tasteless
Other people I was with said the same thing
One friend had the steak which he didn't care for, but after waiting so long to be seated he was hungry
I would say stay away from this place unless you don't mind waiting
this place is dark and busy and open nice and late
food is totally reasonable and really good
i recommend their burger with goat cheese on it - phenominal (fries are really good too)
they have some tuna app i love too
i actually frequent there a lot
one thing though is that the waitstaff is really really bad - they are totally flighty, foreign and usually too concerned with looking cool and flirting with each other
drinks take forever to come and youre never quite sure the waitress even retained what you said
be smart and order a new drink even if you arent done with the one you have
food is def worth it though and is what brings be back constantly
its a fun environment and they play good music as well
This was without a doubt the worst dinning experience I have had in New York
The wait staff was very rude and intrusive
Do not go to this restaurant unless you want to over pay for below average Mediterranean food and deal with a creepy waiter
Busy
Crowded
Sexy
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening
Wouldn't have it any other way
made great recommendations and gave out group the full treatment
Food was average but tasty
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back
He asked if we wanted change when we paid him for our pitcher of Sangria we asked for a couple of dollars back (gave him $30 for $25 pitcher- still leaving him w/ $3 tip) he laughed said are you serious, then got us the change put it on the bar asked us if we were from out of town
No
Then asked if there was a problem with the sangria
No
He stood there looking us up down then walked away

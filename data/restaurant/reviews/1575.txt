Great place, great food, great people!
A friend recommended Candela for our anniversary celebration
had no idea how beaytiful it was
We had a wonderful pretheatre dinner
We wqere prepared to spend so much more for dinner,but our waitress syggested the pretheater dinner
The food was great! Because the meal was such a good value we splurged on a bottle of wine
They have a terrific wine list with some very well priced selections
It was a great evenong
I will be moving out west soon and I wanted a real NYC restaurant with greatdecor and fgreat food
I was recommende to Candela and I am so glad
The food was outstanding,especially the japanese inspired dishes
Wine list was so well priced with an outstanding selection
Our server was very enthusiastic and helpful
When I return to NYC iwill be sure to come here again
Me and my friend took our friend there for her bday and we surprised her with this beautiful restaurant! she was amazed by its appearance and so were we! The food was delicious at a very very inexpensive price
We were seated immediately and we got free champagne because it was our friends b-day but one waiter was very shady about giving us champagne for FREE
But i guess he was told to do it still
Everyone was friendly there, though my friend did say our waiter was rude to her
Other than that the experience was an enjoyable one!
Candela is the best
For our first Valentine's Day together, my boyfriend and I dined at Candela
The experience was wonderful
I could not believe my eyes when I walked in to this resturant
There were candels everywhere! This beautifully dim light restuarant was one of the most romantic places I have been in my entire life
I have never submitted a restaurant review, but I was too incredibly impressed with Candela to be quiet
The atmosphere is relaxing and romantic
We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly and very efficient
I ordered the Grilled Rib-eye steak and it was cooked to perfection, very tasty and the presentation was lovely
Our total dining experience was exceptional
Even the General Manager greeted and chatted with us
Service and quality like that is a rare thing
We will definately be dining at Candela again
Recently returned from a trip to NY
Went to several restaurants during the trip but we returned to Candela several times
First meal was brunch which was absolutely delicious
Had the friendliest waitress who helpd make our dining such a pleasure
The next meal was a pre-theater dinner
My husband and I were treated as if we were spending Big Bucks for the meal
The food was superb and the service very attentive
I only wish we had more time to sample the regular menu
We will do it on our next trip to NY  The ambiance is so romantic and the staff so accomadating
This restaurant is great!!!
On Friday night the busboy was sulky verging on rude; he brought the fries (ordered for the entrees) twice before the appetizers came and then again the minute we'd finished them and looked put out to be asked to take the empty plates away
We told the waitress we'd like the fries hot with our main courses but she only ordered more once the rest of the food had arrived so we didn't get them until we were half way through
The spring roll with the pork chop was burned and the chop quite fatty
Spicy chicken dumplings were good, the waitress very friendly and the room is nice
Overall just an OK though
I had an amazing time at Candela last night
There was a happy hour event in the frint of the restaurant that created an exciting/happening environment
After a few drinks, my friends and I decided to sit down and have dinner
The food was impeccable
We had the Tuna, the Rack of Lamb, and the Catfish
The presentation was beautiful
The service was wonderful
Our server was adorable, as well as the rest of the staff
The manager even approached us to ensure that we were having a quality experience
I would definitely reccomend Candela to my friends
It is incredibly cost efficient
Thank you so much, Candela
Candela is a marvelously restaurant
The atmosphere, the ambience, the food, the service
it is a perfect 10
Six months ago my wife and I got married at there
It was the most wonderful day of my life
Our guests loved the place
Many of them have since returned for dinner
If you live in New York (or are planning a visit) you must add Candela to your list of places to visit
You do not want to miss it
The service is impeccable
The staff is wonderful
It is my favorite restaurant in the world
All of my friends from work loves this place, this is our second home
And a wonderful place for a date
Heard about Candela and its romantic setting, I wanted to see for myself
Having been disappointed numerous times in so called must eats, so I took my wife for our anniversary
I cannot tell you how much we loved our entire experience
From the candles and romantic ambiance, to the scrumptious food and creative wine list , to our waitress, who was attentative but not overbearing perfect for a romatic night, everything made Candela more than expected
The capper was when at the next table, a young gentleman proposed to his girlfriend
I'm not sure who cried more - the girl or my wife
I wish Candela had been around when I proposed!!! The fact that we didn't need to break the bank was even better - unlike some other restaurants we have dined at that left us wanting much more for our buck
We will definetely be back
I've been to Candela on several different occaisions and have always found the food and service to be impeccable! This is me and my friend's favorite restaurant
Everytime I bring someone new they love it!! The ambience is great, food is yummy and the servers are professional and friendly
Great date place, Great to bring your friends for a conversation and also for a night on the town
My boyfriend and I recently went to Candela for a special occasion
We were pleasantly surprised
The food was delicious (we recommend the duck appetizer, the glazed salmon and the ravioli) and it was competitively priced for the Union Square area
Our server was friendly and attentive (and attractive!)
The candlelight added that romantic, cozy feel that is missing in many Manhattan restaurants
We recommend Candela to all our friends, especially those looking for some romance!!
Had a wonderful Mother's day Brunch
Service and food were excellent
It was a terrific value
I would recommend it highly for special events
My Husband and I had our wedding in September of 2005 and we happened to come across this place through my sister who had recommended this place to go to
My husband took me to Candela for valentines day and I was amazed by how breath taking it was and roses were everywhere which blew me away and the food was absolutely delicious
Once we set foot in that place we knew this is where we wanted our wedding
Many thanks to Candela for making our day so special! Helene Greg
One of the best dining experiences I've ever had
Why? Because this place was a vehicle for a great date, everything was so consistent it made our night wonderful

The rest of the waitstaff wasn't that great because it took a while to get seated and to even get menus but all in all it was a very enjoyable meal
Everything from appetizers to desserts were great (make sure you don't fill up on the delicious bread and olives) and be sure to have a well made MASSIVE espresso
Great place to try
I would go back
I often find service in NYC to be either to attentive or non-exhistant and at Django I got just the right mixture
I came in for lunch with some co-workers, and we had an amazing meal for a bargain because they've extended the $20
04 restaurant week menu indefinately! Three courses for that amount in such a beautiful restaurant can't be beat
I was taken here for my birthday dinner by friends and surprisingly for a place this size, they do not allow for reservations over 7 people
The food was mediocre at best
Nothing special for the prices
The dessert menu was a bit lackluster
The staff was, however, amazing
Very attentive and aimed to please
I would consider returning for drinks but not for dinner
I went to Django this past Friday
I called at 7:30 and got reservations for 8:30
The trendy bar downstairs was super cute and we were seated promptly at 8:30
The food was amazing as were the desserts
I would reccomend the mixed fruit and sorbet although the cranberry bread pudding was good too
My coffee was a little too strong but was a small price to pay for an amazing dining experience!!
Funny how the 'staff' has a bigger attitude than the patrons
why is that? The food was ok but not worth the huge price tag and we'll never go there again
It really has potential to be a sexy, romantic place but it's ruined by rude staff who should be lucky to get their pathetic 20%
I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
BAD
Awful experience
After being told we would be called for our 7pm reservation, my guest and I waited in the trendy bar
By 7
15pm we had to seek out the hostess to take us to our table
Once seated we were given two regular menus and one (1) Restaurant Week menu from which to order
We were never offered regular/tap water, just sparkling or still
The appetizers were bland and rushed out to us
The trout entree which so Very Quickly followed was meagre and flavorless
The desserts were decent
The staff was indifferent bordering on rude, and we exited the restaurant at 8
10pm
We had been looking forward to a nice meal at a leisurely pace; never before have I eaten 3 courses (and coffee) in 55 minutes
And the staff couldn't have cared less
I recently made my first (and definitely last) visit to Django
I was offended by the prices they charged relative to the food they served
Let me give you an example
My appetizer was listed on the menu as diver scallops for $16
When the waiter brought my plate out, there were just two scallops no bigger than a quarter
The average cost of each scallop was $8
To charge a customer $16 for two mini scallops is offensive
Also, their drinks are obsenely priced
Their special drink menu cost $10-15 per drink
I'm so tired of restaurants that try to rip off their customers
You need to lower your prices
You have a nice space with food that is actually quite good
But there is no way that I will ever recommend this place
I'm still pissed about paying $16 for scallops
It ruined my whole dining experience
i eat out in nyc all of the time with clients- most attentive service- hard to find that in nyc-- great ambience- great happy hour bar scene- staff is friendly and knowledgable- they go out of their way to make you happy--great food
I ate @ Django last week for lunch for Restaurant week with three of my girl friends
Two of us had the arrugula salad with blood orange and the otherts had the parsnip soup for appetizers-they were delicious
For entrees, we all had the steak frites and it was to die for
At the end we all had the profiterols
Not only is the place beautiful, but the service was friendly and the food excellent quality
I am going back this week, because they are running the restaurant week special and I love a great bargain
Really cool decor complimented by a pleasant staff and great food
Went during restaurant week for lunch and definitely plan to come back in the evening for dinner - reasonable prices and inventive dishes make this a cool addition to the mid town scene
Try the creme brulee and the steak frite!
As far as french food goes in New York, the owners of Django have a long way to go with this confused restaraunt
I have no idea what the Gypsy influence is and the French influence was more Montreal than Montrachet
This restaurant has been hyped out of all proportion to its food or ambiance
For lunch, the bistro dishes are competently executed, but there is nothing special about them at all
Most disappointing is the L-shaped upstairs dining room
It looks like a hotel banquet hall with some beads hanging from the wall and it's all white, resulting in a sterile, cold feel
The service was terrific
Maybe the room has a warmer feel at night, but for daytime this is a miss
The first time I went to Django, it was excellent
The seafood platter was delicious and the mussels were big, plump, juicy and delicious
We brought some friends this week and regret it!  Our second dining experience was nothing short of EMBARASSING
The charcuterie plate was decidedly mediocre at best
The bread was hard and overly-chewy
The mussels were overcooked, undersized, shriveled, dry and leathery
The fries were overcooked, limp and had no potato taste, having shriveled up so badly
The server disappeared during the meal only to reappear to present the bill
The busboy who brought over the charcuterie plate scoffed that we were sharing an appetizer
The server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves
Not to be repeated
The most pleasant dinning experience in those last months
First, it was the best cosmopolitan I had in a while (with fresh lemon juice), then the food was just right and even better
And finally the service was the way it should always be in those restaurants: impeccable but barely noticeable
I can't wait to go back
The food was delicious
We were extremely impressed with the service
No matter how much you fill up on the delicious french onion soup or the fantastic muscel dish, don't skip dessert
The chocolate souffle was outrageous and the presentation on the sorbet was almost as good as the sorbet itself
The space was gorgeous - make sure you check out the bathroom
We will definitely be returning to this new midtown hot spot
This is a very trendy, stylish restaurant
That would be fine if some thought had gone into the acoustics of the dining space; this was absolutely the loudest restaurant I have ever eaten at
something akin to eating in the middle of a downtown traffic jam filled with NYC taxis
Even the waiter agreed that it is difficult working in the midst of such decibel levels! But, to be fair, the food is very good
My wife and I shared a wonderful platter of chilled seafood, followed by a nice selection of charcuterie and some very good escargot
Django, however, would not be proud, despite the fact that this is supposedly a tribute to him
Although good jazz is played in the background, you can barely hear it over the noise; he would not be able to hear himself think, let alone play!
I went with a group of friends and had the private room upstairs

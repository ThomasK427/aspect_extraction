Having visited other English restaurants, my girlfriend and I went here during restaurant week thinking we could expect a very quality dining experience
However, we were wrong
This is honestly one of the poorest excuses for Italian food I have ever experienced in my life, and I eat a lot of Italian food
The highlight of our meal was the garlic bread
We never got the dip platter that everyone else was given as they were seated
We were only given about 30 seconds to decipher the menu (which doesn't actually list any food options)
The pesto pasta tasted like it came from a box labeled Kraft
The chicken would have been good had there been enough for both of us
Their slogan is The marriage of a trattoria and an Italian family feast
However, I see a nasty divorce on the horizon
Bottom line, don't wast your time here
Tthe restaurant is way over-priced and you'll leave wanting a slice (I recommend the lasagna slice from La Pizzeria 442 3rd Ave)
Very disappointing visit during restaurant week
Food was over-seasoned, heavy and overall very uninteresting
Service was also a bit slow despite a quiet night-- although, it was a good thing the water glasses were constantly refilled as the dominant flavor was salt in all the dishes
Atmosphere was good as was the wine list - reasonably priced and nice selections
The best part was definitely the antipasti, also the most limited in quantity despite its boast of family style italian
Better bet for family style italian-- The Olive Garden a few blocks away
They must have read the reviews and shaped up because the service and the food was GREAT
I went once for mother's day and had another craving for their food this weekend
I was never pressured into buying any extras, there were a TON of food and the waiter as well as the manager came up repeatedly to make sure we were doing ok
My mom doesnt eat cheese and they even made a special dish for her, on the house! I would definitely recommend it and go again!
The space and vibe is great and the price is right for a ton of food
The problem is the food is just
bad! The risotto was so salty that it was not edible and the rest was unremarkable
I often read terrible reviews of celeb chefs' places and I think people go in expecting miracles and are disappointed with just good so I went in with an open mind not expecting anything one way or another and I was still very disappointed by the food
Maybe this place is hit or miss but they missed so badly the first time, I won't bother going back
I came to Citysearch just to see what others had to say after having an amazing dinner here
I was amazed that the first review was a bad one, so I signed up just to debunk that naysayer
This place was amazing
Decor was tasteful and romantic, with a touch of exotic
Prompt, thoughtful service
One amazing dish after another - powerful + varied flavors
Probabaly 20+ tapas size dishes just kept coming
Like Italian Tapas
I guess if you can find something to complain about with this place, then you don't appreciate the fact that you're able to afford this level of dining and service
We loved it
P
S
The gin and tonics are big and fat
The bar was wonderful with attentive service
But that was the highlight
We had a sales guy turned waiter and mostly disappointing food
The mozzarella was nice and wine was reasonably priced
You'd think you'd leave wanting to order at least one of the offerings for a full meal but none of us did
I've never written a restaurant review but feel compelled to submit this
The risotto was overly salty, the lamb was forgettable and the fish was ok
The best was the pasta with mussels - but that's a stretch
We did not have dessert but the coffee was not good
Our party of four spent over $300 and I felt totally ripped off
The maitre'd asked what we thought and we told him that it was disappointing
He reacted as if he's heard it all before
Todd English and his staff should be embarassed
This place is a JOKE
The concept sounds so promising, but the execution is pitiful
We went with another couple on a Saturday night and the place was nearly empty- not a good sign
Our waiter had a knack for disappearing whenever we needed him, never asking how the food tasted, or if we wanted more
I'm not saying we would have wanted more of these mediocre dishes, but the servings were miniscule- even for tasting sizes
The biggest letdown was the mozarella ($24, for anyone curious)
It wasn't served on the tableside cart as expected- instead this rubbery slab of tastelessness, encased in a nasty skin, was served plated and with no fanfare
The only positives were the wine list- there was a nice selection of moderately priced bottles (but we had to drink three to offset the disappointing food), and the lovely bartenders at the upstairs lounge
I went to English Is Italian for my birthday last night with 5 friends
It was everything I hoped it would be
Great food, great atmosphere and excellent service
It's the perfect setting to celebrate anything with a large group
I loved not having to worry about what to order and/or how the bill was going to be split
One price, everyone chips in! It was perfect!
Went here with some girlfriends for dinner
Everything was absolutely delicious! I'm glad that I didn't listen to the previously written poor reviews
The food is wonderful, the server was fantastic and the space is beautiful
This is a great place to dine with large groups of people
The only complaint that I have is that there was too much food! We did ask the server to wrap up the meat course dishes because we barely touched them which she did happily!!! I will be back!!
Went with my boyfriend for dinnerm ahd the $39 tasting menu
There was so much food, we could not believe it
And all the food was carefully prepared and delicious
The waiter was very helpful, as was most of the staff
The only exception to this was the not-so-friendly coctail waitess upstairs
Major attitude
But aside from that, it was an all around wonderful experience, and well worth the price
Don't say you weren't warned
While the food is ok, somebody needs to put the staff in their place
Horrible experience
I finally went with two of my co-workers who took me out to celebrate a belated birthday lunch
The Argentinian cabernet by the glass was delicious, which the waiter recommended
One coworkers had the scallops entree and another had the steak sirloin, while I feasted on the taglietele with clams
If you eat it a la carte, not so pricy
Nice open atmosphere, dark wood and lighting, plenty of room to not hear the conversation happening at the next table
the bathroom downstairs was pretty cool
In all, the tab was about $200, which was not bad for three entrees, 5 glasses of wine, and two appetizers
Definitely recommended, if you are in the area!!!
What a fabulous evening!! The food was absolutely amazing!! The service was superb and the ambience was fun!! I was sorry to read some of the prior negative comments
Obviously those people do not know fine dining! I will be going back again soon
The only negative comment is is that there was so much food, we could not finish it all
Pricey but worth every penny
Many of the negative reviews are probably from people who were overwhelmed by the experience
The extras prices are clearly marked on the menu
The tasting menu was excellent and the quality of the food as well
WORTH A TRY!
I recently held my birthday party here and was very displeased
It was painful watching my friends being fleeced

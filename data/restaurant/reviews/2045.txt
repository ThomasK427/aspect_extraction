be ready to wait for at least 1 hour
Yes, you have to wait for a table but it is worth the wait
You get a ton of tasty food and the red wine sangria is to die for
I've been going to this place to eat for years and I always leave drunk, well fed, and happy
The restaurant is small and usually crowded but the food and drink is always excellent, which is why it's always crowded
Not bad on the wallet either
I have been going to Sevilla since I was in high school
The aroma of the garlic and herbs can be smelled from 7th Avenue South, and I start getting hungry
Every year we celebrate a friend's birthday there
Platters of food (meant for one but can feed an army!) Pitchers pitchers of sangria (goes down smooth but packs a wallop
) I love the chicken in garlic sauce, seafood lovers go for the paella, but you can't fault the huge menu
Yes, it's a little dated in appearance
You may have to wait, but is that bad? The food - taste, amount, price - is what's packing them in
We got there and we were told that the wait will be 20 mins
After waiting for almost an hour outside, we were finally seated near the entrance! The restaurant's decor is simple
The service is average
The bread and the salad were brought in first and we had to wait for a couple of minutes before our drinks were served
However, having said all of that, the restaurant's saving grace is the food
We thought the food was excellent especially the paella
Be prepared for a long wait to get a seat !
I looove Spanish food
The rich yet light green sauces, the seafood, the paella, all harmonizing beautifully with a nice sangria is just the foundation for an AMAZING meal
Very friendly wait staff and host just completely express Spanish hospitality
The food here is just amazing: fresh seafood dishes full of flavor, a great cured ham from Spain, and great sangria
Did I mention that the serving sizes are massive? Each dish will feed two people easily
There usually is a wait, so you have to put your name on a list, but if you have a small party, the host will try his best to accommodate you
I have been eating out for 20 years and this is the only place ever where the waiter came over and told me that I was having a conversation too long with my neighboring table and that we both had to leave because they could not meet their quota per tables per night
And I had been a regular
Imagine if I wasn't
There must be some better restaurants around
You go to Sevilla for the food
I've been several times, and have not been disappointed yet
Everything tastes wonderful and is served in you'll never get through it portions
You MUST try the paella! On the negative, the food is so good it attracts large crowds, meaning you will be waiting for a table unless you came early for dinner
Also there's no such thing as a quiet dinner
No matter how hard you try to make it romantic, it won't work
I can't stress enough you should do yourself a big favor and GO EARLY
Besides it'll take a while to get through that yummy food
The food was delicious but I would NOT recommend this restaurant for a group larger than 4
I was in a group of 10 and was told that it would only be a 20min wait but it ended up becoming 1hr 30min
It's expected in a large group but what made it worse was the fact that the host was very sneaky
He told me specifically which tables were being set up for me and then I see him giving it away to someone else 2x!! I put my name on a waiting list but there is absolutely NO use in it since the host doesn't follow it
Be prepare to face this horrible host and to wait a very long time for a table
I was told that the wait for a table would be 1/2 hour and it turned out to be an hour and a half! Every time I asked, the guy at the door kept saying that it would be just a few more minutes, so we (me and 3 friends) stuck around
I was pretty cranky by the time we were seated, but the food was so good that it was hard to stay mad
Still, plan on a LONG wait on a weekend night, and don't believe what the guy at the door says
The food was good, and the waiters were rude
It was not even 9pm when our waiter started to hover over our table, every 5 minutes since then, to urge us to leave while my friend and I were still consuming the large pitcher of sangria and plenty of food which we had ordered no more than 1
5 hours ago
I couldn't believe my ear when finally he said Okay, 5 more minutes as if we were small children
I had never been treated as rudely as I was today
food was very good
had the arroz con pollo, a standby I guess, but done very well and huge portions
Though the waiters were friendly, the service was only okay but the atmosphere was lively: a lot of different groups of people coming in and out
Definitely enjoyable
this place is a great find
all the food they offer is delicous and plentiful
no one will leave this restaurant hungry
great paella and great chicken dishes
food tastes home made
i recommend going early as it gets very crowded on weekends
nothing special with the wines
the waiters are really nice and very helpful
no reservations
This is Spain in Manhattan, the food was fabulous and the service was excellent
I had the Paella Valenciana, it was a bit salty but overall it was very good
Maybe thats why they sell so much sangria
I definitely recommend this place but go early to avoid the wait
The best Spanish food I've ever encountered
Most dishes are served in pots, so sharing is great! The sangria is so wonderful, you'll be on your third pitcher before you realize what hit you
The wait is horrendous, but well worth the meal to come
No RSVP's
You will NOT regret eating here
The general consensus is that you'll feel like a happy, fat Louis the 14th when you exit
and feel as satisfied as a great night of sex!
I went here on a first date
we ordered the paella with chicken, sausage, and seafood -- and, as if that wasn't enough, we had one of the mariscadas as well
Hot, savory, and huge portions! My date knew the waiters from years of dining here, so we were treated like royalty
I can't wait to take my current steady back there for a meal
Great place, great food! Went for dinner Saturday night for the first time
Had garlic shrimp for appetizer and seafood in green sauce for entree
Met a couple that had been married 34 years, who had their first date here, and every year for their anniversary they keep coming back
They said the food is consistently good
It was very inexpensive for a good New York restaurant
In Short Home is an ingeniously designed space that's little larger than a studio apartment but somehow manages to feel cozy and charming
There's a lovely garden out back, where on cool fall nights you can dine under the glow of an electric heater
Fresh ingredients and clever seasoning transform even the simplest dishes, many of which take their inspiration from ingredients culled from New York State farms
Steaks, pork chops, quail, and fish preparations are favorites
I went to Home last night with my boyfriend and enjoyed the relaxed and attentive waitstaff
Our waiter was very informative about all of the ingredients on the menu (taste, where it was from, wine pairings)
As an appetizer, we shared the beet and goat cheese salad, which was very fresh, wonderfully salted and seasoned, and with goat cheese sold at the Union Square Farmer's Market at that wonderfully melt-in-your-mouth room temperature
My entree was the chicken thighs stuffed with sausage on top of garlic spinach and topped with delicate onion rings
Surprising, the portions were JUST RIGHT and the flavors blended together beautifully
In addition, Home makes their own ketchup--a nice surprise for the onion rings
My boyfriend had the steak on top of mashed potatoes, which he said was done perfectly medium rare and was also the perfect portion and great flavor
Overall, the only thing I would suggest is a less can-make-it-at-home dessert menu
Nothing looked very appealing after our dinner
(Apple pies, puddings, bread puddings)
I would definetely go back to Home for breakfast or another relaxing weekday dinner!
Went there for brunch on a Saturday with 5 girls

The waitresses were great when they were actually paying attention to us, but that was few and far between
Not a good place to go in the winter, especially if you're sitting within 15 feet of the door
Our group was freezing cold
Luckily, the delicious food was warm and really hit the spot
They have a little glossary of terms so you can figure out what you're ordering, but even then we still had to ask what some of the stuff was
No one was disappointed with their food except for the fact that there were anchovies on the Caesar salad
The food is a fantastic mix of mexican flavors with french skills
The flavors were new and complex
The food is perfectly presented, the price is normal, and the ambient was laid back and unpretentious, perfect for a nice night with friends
This tiny restaurant is a great refreshment for the neighborhood
The food is amazing! Ive already tried every single dish on the menu and I have never been disappointed
The food is a very unique fusion of French and Mexican cousin
Especially, I recommend the duck, lamb and steak
It is not a BYOB anymore
And their sangria is one of the best out there
I strongly disagree with the service criticism below
Girls are always nice and customers get their attention all the time
It is a great place for a date
The food here is fantastic
While the service is a bit shaky, the bargain prices more than make up for it
I'm still thinking about the pumpkin creme caramel I had for dessert
I've been here 4 times, and each time its marvelous
The French-Mexican cuisine is imaginative and delicious
There are no tacos or burritos on this menu! This place is great for a date and there is rarely a wait for a table
Try the Kaluha pot de creme for dessert!
This place is excellent
I went here on a Sunday night and couldn't have been moer pleased
The quiet ambience was great as was the scrumptious food
I had the lamb shank and it just about melted in my mouth
I would definitely recommend this Spanish Harlem jewel
The free glass of sangria with every meal doesn't hurt either!
Great wings - I'd say best in the city, easy
DIff levels of hotness in the sauce makes a great selection, or i like the honey mustard and bbq as well
Also - if someone in your home wants wings, and someone wants fresh fruit salad, or a chicken caesar salad - they are very accomodating and have selectrions on the menu beyond their flagship wings
The Scene The coiffed, stilettoed scenesters have largely passed on this refined, yet rustic, brownstone where windows open to the street and billowing curtains beckon serious diners to the burly wooden door
Just beyond the sleek entry-level bar hides a sunken garden patio surrounded by climbing vines; above is the dining room, fit with wooden church pews; and all through, exposed beams and wrought iron
Cavalier service is a bit of a buzzkill
The Food Chef Zakary Pelaccio borrows the fun aspects of various Asian cuisines, putting his own playful spin on them
Decadent slow-cooked pork belly lolls atop rich, tangy rhubarb-lemon sauce; worm-shaped noodles are served in a cast-iron pot with savory brown sauce and Chinese sausage
Pelaccio's forte is working with burly cuts of meat, such as a caveman-ish rib of tender goat, falling off the bone into fresh, buttery corn
Went to 5 Ninth for lunch
Have to admit the restaurant/brownstone is absolutely gorgeous - a bit hard to find - was standing outside for a good 10 minutes wondering if this was the place
Our bartender/waiter was extremely pleasant and although he lacked the knowledge of the menu - he was great in asking the chef any questions we had
Had the Asian cucumber salad - which was drenched in the dressing - which was mediocre
For the entree, had Shrimp chow fun - good but small portion
Also had goat cheese spinach omlette on a baguette - okay - nothing special
Perhaps the dinner menu is a bit more creative but the lunch was v
limited and not v
appetizing
I had high hopes for this restaurant but aside from the ambiance - the food was average
A friend of mine took me here for my bday dinner and I absolutely loved it! First of all, I had a hard time finding this place b/c it was tucked away in this quaint townhouse (very cute)
You walk into the townhouse and there's a beautiful veranda facing an outdoor garden in the back of the restaurant, which is where we sat
The food was fantastic and memorable
We had the monk fish (which was a daily special) and the duck
both amazing! The monk fish was so flavorful and it melted in my mouth with the consistency of fresh gnocchi
Im not a huge duck fan, but their duck was so delicious! The ambience rounded out the experience perfectly it was unpretentious and comfortable, yet stylish and romantic
Truly a gem! And, my new favorite restaurant!
I dined at 5 Ninth the other night with a friend after wandering around the M
P
District checking out the options
My only gripe is (I admit we did arrive before the 8pm dinner rush on a Tuesday when it was kind empty) that by the time our meal was over the second floor was packed almost elbow to elbow on the banquet seating where I was
Not very intimate
But the food was quite good as was the service
Plus, there were many reasonably priced wines that were good
I came here with my girlfriend for valentine's and we had such an enjoyable and memorable experience
The place is very romantic and beautiful
We were seated by a fireplace with candles
We had a lovely dinner and an excellent bottle of wine, the desserts were delicious and the service(even though the restaurant was busy) was attentive without being too pushy
We later went to the lounge upstairs and the manager bought us a round of champagne
Made our night very special We will be back!
Love the space, it is so beautiful
Waitress was a hoot, and took the time to explain food and the not so common wine list (which by the way, is very impressive, we ordered to differnt bottles of wine and loved them)
There where some dishes that took our breath away, the sturgeon, the cuban sandwich, shrimp and chix salad and lamb , but then how do you explain the over milky coconut cod, the confused ribeye steak and the awful sweet/sour soup! Apparently, the waitress informed us that they change the menu at 5 Ninth every few days, which kind of explains the hit or miss situation
Oh and we ordered the chix wings at the bar, AMAZING!! In any case - the ambiance, service, drinks and certain dishes(hopefully if they are on the menu that day) will definately be a reason to come back
I went to 5 Ninth last night with five of my friends for drinks and we where taken to the third floor
I didn't realize they had it
It was so cool, great design, felt private but at the same time you could watch people strutting up and down the meat-packing square from the view at the bar where we happened to be perched on
I loved the cocktails, 3 of us ordered a different one (pricey, mind you), but my favourite was mine
a diki hiki or wiki, or something, ANYWAY, what ever it was, it was great
The bubbly bartender was very friendly and sweet
Didn't eat though but will defintely be back to try the food!
We were graciously accommodated when our group of 6 appeared on Thursday night sans reservation
How civilized to be able to wait for your table on the 3rd floor lounge, as if it were a rich friend's townhouse, not a restaurant in DisneyNewYork
Music is very important to us and it was fun, lively, not distracting
The wine connoisseur's eyes lit up when he opened the wine list
Our appetizers were all excellent, but the mussels really stood out
Ever seen grown men ask for more bread so that they can fight over the sauce at the bottom of the plate? I have
We ordered the chicken, steak and cod for our entrees
A's for all
Japanese eggplant was the best side
Our knowledgeable waitress made stellar recommendations and had no problem discouraging us from ordering certain questionable dishes
Service was orchestral
The Europeans were in awe
I was blown away by how tasty all of the meals were here! The specials had a great combination of familiarity with a new twist that made you want to eat every little morsel
There was a sophisticated Thai flair to the dishes that really expanded your palate
The place was so cute, in a hard to find house on a very trendy block
And the DESSERTS!
This place is my new favourite place to bring a date
The food was great and the wine selection was excellent(we got a spanish Numanthia, which was delicious)
THe space itself is a unique town house with a warm feel

It was the most dissapointing dining experience I've ever had
The service was rude
I had ordered an escargot app in which they forgot the escargot
and they tried to bring it separately and have me mix it with the messed up order! Not only did they not apologize at first but tried to laugh it off by saying This is how we serve it now
I promptly had them bring it back
Already not impressed I was hoping that the burger would redeem them
But it did not
It was the worst burger I have ever had! It was served lukewarm, while my fries were soggy and on the stale side
I could not even bring myself to order dessert
My favorite restaurant when I want some place special
The presentation is second to none, and the dishes are very unique combining ingredients I've never before considered! It is not pretentious at all and the staff was extremely courteous in answering any questions I had about the menu
Their burger is unlike any I've had before
And their fries are fried to golden perfection
Every thing I've had there
I've never been disappointed
Do not wate your time going to this overrated, over-priced bistro
The world famous burger was bland and the fries were no mcdonald's fries that's for sure
The dessert was a real disappointment
It was unoriginal and unappetizing
We actually sent one back
the service was abysmal
our waitress (who was ok) disappeared in the middle of our dinner, leaving us to an obnoxious amateur (must answer the phones or something) who could not answer our questions and treated us extremely rudely
Don't believe the hype
What a bad dining experience
Went for the burger
Abysmal would be a bit harsh, but save your $$ and go to JG Melon or Corner Bistro instead
They make DB's burger seem like a pinto (a very large one, but qualitatively like a Pinto nevertheless)
Desserts were pretty good, but then again even I could whip up a pretty good melted chocolate and melted caramel pudding
Our waiter was atrocious - one of the unfriendliest, rudest, most disinterested twerps I've had the displeasure of being waited on by
Suffice it to say that I won't be going back (and question whether I'd even waste my time and $$ going to Daniel)
I went in just for the burger, but ended up staying for a lot more
Great time had by all in the party
The burger is large, and VERY tasty, but the menu includes many other notable dishes, and the room is very laid back, but upscale
Another winner from DB!
The burger is too large to eat, but the other choices are tasty and reasonable
The less formal food and atmosphere make this a great place to sample Boulud fare at more reasonable prices
Having read many of the reviews posted to this site of late, my fiancee and I has some trepidation in keeping our reservation at db for a pre-theater dinner
However, once we entered and were greeted by courteous and efficient staff all concerns faded away
The servers were excellent and never too far or too busy to see that our every whim was met
The food was beautifully presented, properly prepared and, we felt, worth the steep price tag
Certainly recommend anyone to check our db bistro
Only one drawback was there was no music playing until we were just about to leave
If you want to try all three of his restaurants, either start with this one or skip it altogether
The food was terrible
My fish dish was salty with no flavor, while my husband had 'The Burger'
Ok
it's burger with lots of ingredients
But that's the final word
it's a burger, even with all the prep work
The manager (or someone very important that was able to be seated 1/2 hour before opening) sat in the corner, with a glass of wine, a date, and talked on his cell for about an hour, loudly, while the first arrivals were sent to the hotel tearoom next door
Even though we were told to come 15 min before our reservation because we had a show to attend (tearoom is closed too)
Nothing to write home about
Finding good food elsewhere is not far
The food was rubbish and the service even worse
The layout of the restaurant was cramped, I mean isnt it annoying if the back of your chair is touching the back of another customer's chair and that you constantly get knocked about everytime someone moves
This is what the maitre d said in a most obnoxious manner we are a bistro, well they certainly do not charge bistro prices for $250 meal for 2, I think I would have been happier chomping on a McDonalds burger
After dining at db Bistro Moderne, I can see why Daniel Boulud hold the reputation he does
Despite this being his more casual 'bistro,' the food, ambience and service have all of the qualities of a first-class establishment
The tuna tartare was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and the beet/blue cheese/walnut salad was a sublime rendition of oft-combined ingredients
The service was a bit prozac-gracious at first, but the server mellowed out after we pushed back a little
Great for after the theater
I have wined and dined in NYC for many years and I must tell you that DB Bistro is a great location with an incredible menu
The signature item of the DB Burger is tremendous; what can be bad about a sirloin burger with Braised short ribs, foie gras and Black truffles on an onion parmasan bun
Don't miss the tuna tartare or lobster salad
Save room for chhese and dessert
Downside
no room for a drink before dinner as there is no real bar
Doc
I've eaten at DB three times now, always pre-theatre
The host/wait staff are competent and pleasant
The menu is bistro
not a ton of selections, but something for everyone
And, the burger is supposed to be truly amazing
Last week, I ordered the butternut squash/lobster soup (amazing!), monkfish (excellent!), and fig tart (scrumptious!)
The portions are neither too small nor too large
and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity
The front room setting is lovely, the artwork of red/yellow tulips brings to mind giant vivid flames
Great location for a theatre night
great food for any night
Everything was perfect
The place is cozy and friendly
The foie gras burger is everything they say it is
The wait staff was incredibly knowledgeable of things they don't normally don't know (what's the differnce between bacalao and cod?)
Prompt service
The wine list is affordable, albeit short
Ah, and the difference is that bacalao is cod cured in salt
I thought it was good, portions were a tad smaller than my liking but service food taste was good
Wine list was different
I dined there a few weeks ago and ordered the $29 burger
I'm a big fan of foie gras, but didn't seem to have any taste of foie gras at all
The burger was still very good, however not sure if it's worth the money or the hype
Service was okay, but not great
Probably will not go there again
I have been wanting to try the famous db burger, but the dinner menu was so attractive and mouth watering, I decided to pass and try it another time
Instead, I enjoyed every spoon of a chilled pea soup that was an ode to the season
The Maine halibut that followed, on a bed of delicate fava beans and a wonderful broth was also delicious
The 5 of us really enjoyed our food, the wine list is interesting and overall, it's not that pricey (well, compared to Daniel anyway!)
db's chef deserves attention
Service was impeccable, Daniel style
Went for the pre-theater prix-fixe dinner - service was rushed and wholly disorganized

There's a whole list of restaurants at this price range and below that will blow The View out of the water! Marriott's rep for the NY Marriott Marquis isn't all that good either
It's clear that the restaurant's normal business is to charge outrageous prices for mediocre food and an unsophisticated dining experience
The view and ambience was perfect
Loved it
The service was great, prompt seating and friendly staff
Good food!! The view and ambience was what I like best though!
I had dinner at the buffet (in the lounge)
Although it was a Friday evening, we just waited a few minutes at the elevator but were directly sitted as we arrived
We had a table just near the window
Food was good
It's maybe a bit overpriced but you have many different dishes and the view is quite impressive
Wine was really good too
I really wanted to go there and I was not disappointed!
My boyfriend surprised me for our 1 year Anniversary to THE VIEW
I had no idea the experience I was in for!!!! The place is amazing
the lighting is perfect
the service is extraordinary
The waiter saw my camera even asked if we needed some pictures taken of us
I'm serious!! The food was delicious the portion sizes weren't skimpy we barely had room for dessert
The desserts were AMAZING!!! I had the sampling of the mini Creme Bruele's
to die for!!!!! Worth the extra 2 hours at the gym!!! If your looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, with ambiance style look no more
this place has it all
I give the place a perfect 10 :)
My husband and I went there for our ten year anniversary and we are sorry we wasted our time there
The food was horrible and grossly overpriced! We feel so cheated, it was the worst dinner we ever had any where! Do not recommend going there at all!
The food was too expensive, and it tast bad
The view was not what I have expected
It is not beautiful at all
My girlfriend and I was very disappointed
We thought we can enjoy a romantic evening
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
I only recommend this for the view and the chocolate fountain
The service was not great
The wait too long
There was a line just to get on the elevator and another line to be seated for drinks
Some seating isn't as good as other seating
overrated
This is for the View Restaurant - not the Louge or Buffet
Great date /special day place
Service was terrific, food very good
Pricey but worth it
Specialized napkins coordinating the room w/ the buildings as you see them (the room turns!)
Beautiful especially on a clear nite
Need to improve on directions within the building, no one greeting you downstairs we waited on line when we didnt need to since we had reservations
The Lounge looked like fun too, plenty of couches desserts
Fun to do in the City
I had been to the view lounge a couple of times and this was the first time after they reopened
The food was kept the same average as before for a buffet, good choices and all
The service really slow
We were almost done with our food when the server came with the bottle of wine and it was a regular Monday, not busy at all
Bad NEW news: if you are not staying at Marriot hotel, since they reopened you have to pay a 7 dollars cover charge which is completely nonsense
Cover charge for what? The View??? Besides spending money with the food and drinks, be ready to pay this unreasonable cover charge and give the server the proper gratuity for the food that you served yourself, as far as it is a buffet, your drinks plus tip over thecover charge
After all that, enjoy the view!!!
The View has been totally renovated and just re-opened
The new chef is awesome
This is going to be a hot spot
The menu and wine and beverage list is focused on New York products
It is great to see a major restaurant supporting the New York wineries
Went here for anniversary
Expected extraordinary experience
We were seated near the window, which is good
Views are really nice and experience of slow rotation with nice views is really something
We asked for water
Waiter said that there's no free water
We have to pay for it
It felt like a rip off
Food -- TERRIBLE
It tasted bad
Absolutely nothing special
Portions are very small
Prices are direct opposite
We got ice cream for desert -- they brought it completely frozen, and it was plain vanilla out of supermarket
Nothing special, except the price
I heard there's a buffet on another level, also rotating -- would suggest to go there instead
Waiter was somewhat rude and unhelpful
Makes sense to go here, get a nice window seat and order something cheap and just enjoy the view
Don't go here for the food
This rating is for the buffet and lounge not the restaurant located in the Marriot
The buffet food was average, but it was nice to have a moderate amount of choices for dinner and a nice spread of choices for the dessert and cheese section
The drinks here are pricey, but that's what you pay for the view, though the drinks are good
My wife had the Tiramisu Martini and I had the top of the view, I think that's the name of it
The place revolves once an hour so you get a great view of the city
Groups of two sit on the very outside of the restaurant and get the best views, our party had 3 and 4 when we went so we could not sit at the outermost seats
You can use the napkin to identify different buildings
Neat
Had reservation at 7pm got right in
The view and service was excellent
The food was great
Ordered dom champ and the waiter did great
always making sure we aere okay and filling our glasses
The food come out correct and tasted great
would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that doesn't mind paying high prices but getting great service ,view, and food
The atmosphere is romantic not forkids
went on 2-21-04
My wife and I had reservations at the view for 11:00 p
m
after a broadway show
If you plan to eat here after a show, you must make a reservation
The line for people with no res
was verry long

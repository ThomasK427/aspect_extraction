Ordered the portabello mushroom appetizer which was delicious
The pizza we got half pepporoni and half with peppers/mushrooms/oninos/xtra cheese
For a brick oven place the pizza was very soggy to the point where you couldn't cut it
The toppings weren't even baked in therefore falling all over the place as your try to eat
I don't think this is the best brick oven pizza, but it's not the worst
They need to work on the soggy issue
Plus side: very cheap
From the minute you set foot in Lombardis you are transported back in time to old world Italy
Back hundreds of years ago pizza was made simple, as it was a peasants food eaten by the poor working class
Lombardis continues this tradition of simplicity by preparing pizza the old way
San Marziano tomatoes (the best in the world due to volcanic runoff in this region in Italy) fresh mozzarella cheese, and garnished with basil and extra virgin olive oil served to you HOT
Cooked in a 100yr old coal oven it takes only 4min to cook
The experience culminates when the waiter appears and presents you with your meal
With Frank Sinatra singing in the background nothing could be better
Trust me this is nothing like the corner pizza parlor!
lombardi's is still the most original, delicious pizza around
everything about the place is homemade
the small pies are enough to feed two people and the toppings are all fresh - cheese, mushrooms, pepporoni, you name it
the sauce is fantastic, makes the pizza the best around town
very highly recommended - my friends and i are regulars there - and it's super affordable to boot!!
You're coming to lombardi's because you live in the neighborhood or you live in a TRAVEL Guide
Their pies are DONE and if they aren't careful soon they'll be another rays
This generation doesn't care about food, just profit
LOMBARDI PIES HAVE GONE WAY WAY down during the past 6 years
I live here; i know
It seems most of the guys making the pies are from rays too! No two days will give you the same pie
really thick crust/really thin just a bit of mozz one day half an inch the next let me give you a little chard crust sorry its raw too bad its burnt this time
Top ratings must be given by Rays/Dominos connoisseurs because Arturos-JohnsBleeker-Grimaldi's-pastys even TwoBoots are all FAR FAR SUPERIOR! Rays is a block up on Prince St
Eat well
the ranking is right this is the best, the service was fast the pizza was awesome and I WILL RETURN THERE VERY SOON
Great crisp crusted pizza with fresh mozzarella toppings
If you like tomatoes on your pie, they have large beefsteak ones here
The most over-rated pizza in the city
Serves nostalgia with bad service long lines of tourists
While the pizza is okay, it isn't worth the wait, crowds of tourists, and below average service
I never thought I would find anything better than Lou Malnatti's in Chicago, but I did when I dined at Lombardi's! Yes, the crust is a bit black in places, but that's what you get from an intensely hot coal oven! The toppings and sauce were high-quality and fresh- we had meatballs and sausage
The cheese was incredible- none of that grated or chunked stuff
For some reason, the squares seem to melt together better
Went on a Sunday about 2pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes
Can't wait to go back this summer!
I had heard about it
So I came here to read about it
Most reviews were great so I went there
A very long wait
Then they took us upstairs where it was pretty dark and cold
The waitress came and took our order kinda bored
The portobello mushroom was cold
The pizza was below average
Just my 2c
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED about burnt pizza reviews
It's CHARRED not burnt
If you don't like charred- don't order Brick-Oven-Pizza!!!   Delivery process- We asked about the type of mushrooms were told FRESH
hee;) Further inquiry-Portobella
Don't get TooExcited- they WERE NOT! New patrons- get plain or 1/2plain - it was excellent
It has fresh basil! Told1hour, took 45mins
Arrived lukewarm but we still were very pleased
I'd prefer pie 2be cooked slightly more (crust was a bit doughy) but may vary on how busy they are
TomatoSauce was EXCELLENT w/nice sweet flavor wonderful texture
Generous w/ sauceToppings- the more you get the softer the crust
ALL-IN-ALL we were very satisfied- we are both hard2please
Lombardi's has a *very* basic menu
Not elaborate
I give 8
7 he 9
4 for gd basic pizza
I'd give 9
5 if it were cooked more arrived warmer
Maybe next time;)
Hope this helpsYouDecideIfThey're4U!
I am a huge fan of authentic coal-oven pizzas, but it was just TOO burnt tasting
For me, it overpowered the toppings
I recommend Grimaldi's in Brooklyn way before this place
I did enjoy my baked clams appetizer
The service? Forget it, I'm not kidding when I tell you the waiter tried to give us our check before we even got our pizza
It was also very touristy
The best part about my meal was going across the street to Rice to Riches for delicious rice pudding
Listen, it ain't rocket science
All it takes is a nice crispy, well cooked crust
not greasy and never doughy! Then, tangy sauce
not too much but not el cheapo either
put just enough on and err on the side of too much
Then real cheese but not so much that it's all gooey and make sure it's never stringy
Now, as for toppings, I like pepperoni
Make the pepperoni real, Italien pepperoni, spicey and sliced thicker, not that cheap, paper thin, wide diameter garbage that leaks oil all over the pizza
It's that simple people! How come Lombardi's is the only one that can do this? How come I live in Queens and hate dragging my rear down into Manhattan in the middle of Winter to get it??
I went there today (Saturday, January 24, 2003)
The waiting time was about 25 minutes out in the cold (you will see later why I mentioned that)
When our turn came they sent us upstairs in something they call the deck
That was their roof which is covered with plastic all around and has almost no heat AND it had 7 EMPTY tables
The service was lousy (we were in the roof
remember)
The waitress came three times: to take our order, to bring the order, and to bring the check
In order to get a second soda we had to go downstairs
The pizza was average for a place that claims to have the best
Maybe it will be better in the summer (in the roof again of course :o) )
Anyway, I don't recommend this to anyone
Thank you for your time, Harry
Lombardi's pizza is about thin crust, generous amounts of sauce, and small squares of mozarella
Some people like this style, some don't
Lombardi's makes a great pizza, but not perfect (I'm difficult to please)

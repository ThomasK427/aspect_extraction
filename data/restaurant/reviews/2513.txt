On top of that, none of us ordered alcohol and it ended up being 20$ a person and we weren't even nearly full
This place is lucky it doesn't have any real competition in the columbia area
Went here for Restaurant Week last night and had a fabulous time
The service could not have been better, the food was yummy - even though the portions were very small (not sure if it's due to restaurant week), the harp player was great as background music, the $36 bottle of wine was good, the view of the GWB was nice
I think this would be a good place for a romantic night out as the prices are a bit steep so it's not good for an all the time thing
Ask for a seat outside where they have a live band if the weather is good or in the fully enclosed glass room for a better view than what we had
Went for brunch and was extremely disappointed
The view is lovely, and the outdoor terrace is a terrific place for a drink in the warm weather, but do yourself a favor and don't dine here
The quality of the food is average, and the service is pathetic!  When my 100 year old grandmother asked for potatoes instead of the rice side that came with her chicken, the waiter said, we only serve potatoes with the steak
What?! I ordered a bellini and they made it with peach schnapps instead of peach juice
We had to specifically ask the waiters to refill our water glasses, to take away the cluster of unused wine glasses crowding the table, etc, etc
Lots of little things that added up to a large frustration
It's not very expensive, but it still isn't worth it
Disregard some of these negative reviews
I have lived on the upper west side for 25 years and have been to this restaurant on several occasions and always left impressed
Firstly, The space is beautiful and most importantly the food is awesome
I was recently there for my anniversary and indulged in the tasting menu
My wife and I sampled everthing from duo of venison to an amazing diver sea scallop dish
The food was thoughtfully presented and tasted magnificent
They also had an amazing selection of Cheese and wine
We dine out at least twice a week and really appreciate a good meal and this place does not dissapoint
I went to Terrace in the Sky during Restaurant Week
I'd been there once before for a reception and the finger food had been quite good
But my second visit during lunchtime last week was disappointing
First, it was way too bright indoors due to excessive sunlight
My friends and I were squinting at each other during the entire meal
Second, the service was far from impressive
Our waiter was perfectly nice, but each course was preceded by a loooong wait
Third, the food was not great
the white bean soup appetizer was tasty enough, but the vegetable risotto entree I got was below average
I actually left half of it on my plate - something I rarely do
I don't know if the restaurant put in less effort because we were just there for Restaurant Week, but in any case I will not be returning there any time soon
Pay them a visit
The staff was cordial and knowledgable
Romantic candle lit tables with roses made my 19th wedding anniversary dinner excellent
The food was perfectly presented and delicious
Live music played on a harp was the icing for me
Use the tasting option for the chef's selection for novices such as myself
I went to this restaurant one night after work and it was horrible
First it was really expensive for average food I could've made at home
Second, the view was of the projects - nothing nice to look at
Third, the waiter had an attitude
Lastly, the decor was stuffy and was better suited for elderly people
I was not impressed at all
There are tons of better restaurants in New York
Don't even waste your time
I was dragged here by someone, the person in charge of picking Terrace blew everything out of proportion
I was promised a view, good food, service and nice decor/ambience
Boy was she wrong, the menu/food was poorly executed
The view wasn't that much breath taking
It WAS romantic
and the only saving throw for this restaurant
But you can't just feast on just romantic atmosphere can you? There are way more romantic restaurants in new york city and I feel I was lied to after going to Terrace
This restaurant isn't what it is hyped up to be
The food was excellent and so was the service
I went there with my wife and the ambiance was just perfect for a nice romantic dinner
We will definitely go back again, and this time we will be bringing friends
This lovely restaurant is a slice of NYC
Yes, it's inconvenient and it's at the top of a Columbis U dorm, but once you get there, it's gorgeous
The views are wonderful and the food is innovative, well prepared and not trendy at all
If you want trendy people and food, go downtown
I've been there many times in the last 20 years and it's still the same
GREAT in all areas
Great place for a private party
I got married there last year and incorporated the terrace into the ceremony and all the guests had a wonderful time
I strongly disagree with several of the previous member reviews
I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times for business and it has never failed to impress
First, the food has always been fresh, refined, and consistent
I have never seen a dish fail or see a diner disappointed
Second, the service has always been professional and attentive
Third, you can actually get a resrvation without jumping through hoops of fire! Fourth, compared to many other upscale restaurants, the price is reasonable(3 courses+wine+tip$80/person)
I'm so tired of paying $200/person for questionable food at places that make you beg for the privilage to dine
I rate this place highly recommeded because,within its genre, it always remains a safe bet
Wonderful ambience, and a beautiful view of Manhattan
Sad part: Service was poor
Asking for spoons to stir our coffee brought dirty looks from our attendants
While the brunch could certainly be a great bargain, and the food was actually pretty good, receiving bad service all around was just not worth it
The restaurant only had 5 tables to serve, ours being the largest
I would think that we would have received stellar service
This place would be wonderful if the service was better
The wait staff absolutely bring down the value of such a beautiful find in the city
And it would behoove the owner/manager to either re-train his staff to deliver smile with a service; or to hire new new ones
It's not any easy job, but at least make your guests feel welcome and respected!!!!
I went to Terrace in the Sky during Summer 2004 Restaurant Week
Getting to the restaurant was difficult and unpleasant as you had to drive through a bad neighborhood
The ambiance inside the restaurant is spectacular with the large window views (althougth it overlooks an unimpressive surrounding)
Service and food is excellent
A bit pricey for fine dining in its location
My Family of 5 went for New Years Eve
The view was wonderful, band was great, food was quite good considering the amount of people
The service was possibly the worst I've ever had
It took an hour for us to order, another hour and 15 min to get our entree's I had to go to the bar to order my champange, and carry it back myself, the waiter got our entrees mixed up and placed them in the wrong place and sat there and watched me switch them around
and worst of all it took so long to bring my mother a fork, we had to share one fork between us to eat our entrees, the service was horrendous, for $175 a head, they should be able to afford a decent wait staff!!!!
While the food wasn't that bad, everything else left much to be desired
The hostess gave us the wrong directions, the waitstaff has not been trained properly and the view of the Bronx is not cute
Don't bother going all the way uptown to this place, it's not worth the trip
I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about
I have eaten everywhere from Gramercy Tavern to Nobu to LeCirque and the food at the Terrace is as good if not better
If you don't get a window table, it isn't the end of the world!! Now that the greenhouse is open, you can enjoy the views there
When in season try the white truffle tasting menu for a pure treat

the prices were crazy for just mediocore food
i wasn't impressed
the service was slow and you have to pay for refills! although there were many downsides, i liked the place because of the great atmospere, i would go back
If you love Europe, you are going to love this place
3 hour afternoon experience makes you feel you were not in America
Make sure you make reservation before you go
Overall, it's the perfect afternoon tea place, the best in New York
$35/person for 5 courses is well worth it
I've been to Lady Mendl's in the past on several occasions and I've always sung their praises
I brought an out of town friend there the past Saturday
Although the decor is lovely as usual, service has detiorated
Service which was once attentive, polite and friendly is now stiff and full of pretension
Of the three servers, only one was able to crack a friendly smile
Maybe they're just trained to cater to tourists now who think stiff is the equivalent of high end service
The wait staff should be retrained by the pros at the Four Seasons or Daniele's
When I politely requested more tea (unlike Tea Sympathy's individual teapots with tea leaves, Lady Mendl's larger teapots can quickly become tepid ) the waiter's response was NO
But I can add more hot water DUH?
If you have been to as many afternoon tea's as I have you will know that Lady Mendl's is as close as you are going to get to feeling like a lady having afternoon tea
The service is excellent and always informative without an air
You feel safe to ask What do I do with this?   For experienced tea takers and novice alike I would highly recommend Lady Mendl's
I took my parents to Lady Mendl's yesterday afternoon and they and I were immensely pleased, not just with the tea and food offerings, but also with the service
The teas, first of all, were delightful and the cookies, sandwiches and pastries were delicate and delicious
They are small but with five courses, you definitely get full! And as I said, the service was absolutely impeccable--polite, proper and attentive, but without being in-your-face about it
The setting is also very attractive, cozy and charming
I highly recommend Lady Mendl's
On the pricier side, but worth it for the experience
The Scene Back in 1989, when Keith McNally first brought smoky mirrors and late-night steak frites to Soho, this bistro-meets-tavern was the hottest table for money-making artists and their entourages
These days, the buzz has moved on to McNally's other ventures, like Balthazar, Pastis and Schiller's
But the narrow front bar, with its low tables, bistro mirrors and well-worn wood floors, is still a good spot to gossip over a jumbo-sized cocktail
The Food Some pastas, a few salads, steak frites--this is food you don't really have to think about
A dollop of warmed, herb-sprinkled goat cheese and a quick scatter of almond slivers improves a standard-issue mesclun salad
Getting into the steak frites takes some sawing, but once cut, the meat is flavorful, if in need of salt
An order of roast chicken is nicely crisped and moist, although the potato cubes alongside are limp
Great turkey burgers and sour sour sour lemonade
I have never tried anything else on the menu the burgers are so good
Perfect place to hang out with friends and get some good (just good) typical bistro food - DJ on saturday nights is not too shabby - good looking people, too
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food
While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one
Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good! I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't
Great food, great decor, great service
I recommend it! Just ignore the trendy wannabes
haven't been here in a long time and forgot how cute and warm it is inside
My burger was amazing and service friendly
now i won't wait so long to go back!
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way)
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8
50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests
You can't go wrong with this place
We waited 1 hour for a table in the smoking section finally got it by hovering over a couple until they left Service was average value another 8 dollar beer joint One more issue was out in the middle of Union Square Park with a table next to us chain smoking Marlboros we were told we could not smoke a cigar because a friend of the owner has asthma and she complained
Luna Park was packed with people when I went on a hot Friday night
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile
I didn't go there for food so I can't comment
A con was the slow bar service
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there
I'm a 20% tipper, even when service is mediocre
This is the one time in my life where I left no tip at all
My friend and I were the ONLY 2 people in the entire place seated for dinner and after sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to walk over to our surly waiter and ask for menus
He then proceeded to be rude
We had to call him over 3 times during the meal because he gave us the wrong food, did not bring water after we asked twice, gave me the wrong drink, and did not check on us once
Then he split the bill evenly even though we had instrcuted him otherwise
When I asked to speak to a manager, he indifferently told me that there was none
Leave it to the mediocre coffee shop chain to make this nightmare into a cash cow
although this is an ideal setting for those hot new york nights, it gets way too overcrowded and loses the appeal
the service is horrible as well, probably the worst ever
While this place is full of young AmEx pencil necks trying to business card people, it is a great place to sit and take in a goodlooking crowd
More of a happy hour place during the summer hours
Come for a drink and see if anything is there you like, sometimes it's packed with women, others, it's not
Not sure why everyone is hating this place
Had a meal with 8 people, 2 more showed up and they got another table 4 us
the food was excellent
serivce was great at the table, then they rushed us out after we payed the bill
I was ok with it, but some friends were annoyed
you can't beat the location
I did not see any mice, but if i did i would have been pissed too
During the day, it's a great place to enjoy a drink on a sunny day
At night, it's a meat-market, although some might prefer that vibe
After all the food complaints I read, I was pleasantly surprised by the food
It wasnt' the best, but it was passable
And the service was pretty good
BUT the mice are everywhere
An elderly tourist at the table next to me freaked out and jumped over to our table and knocked over my wine
And didn't even apologize! Just don't sit in the corner by the ivy bushes and you'll be ok
Oh, the bathrooms are pretty gross
to start off the waitress that helped us sucked royally
she took forever to get our order taken, drinks weren't always refilled when asked

30pm and it was NOT worth the wait
The food and service were fine but not worth the aggravation!!
We came to Bouley for our anniversary and I couldn't have dreamt of a better evening
Even though we had to wait over an hour to be seated (with reservations!), the waitstaff certainly made up for it
Several freebies interspersed throughout the meal, attentive and entertaining service, and the food
oh the food
utter perfection
They worked around my dietary restrictions and created truly sumptuous concoctions
Definitely worth every penny
The food was all we could have expected, the service completely professional
I especially enjoyed the desserts
Our waiters were very attentive and precise
I really felt comfortable, almost all the tables have a banquette
We ate in the Red Room and it was a little dark for me, but still a lovely feeling
While we were waiting for our car, the host staff was very friendly and accomodating, checking in on us many times
I will definitely return and I recommend it highly
The food can be fantastic, but Bouley can have the worst service in the city if you catch them on an off night--and there are MANY off nights
Beware
Lunch there was a spiritual experience
The $45 tasting menu was superb and a bargain to boot
The service was impecible, the decor charming and the presentation very polished
The little going away gift of chocolate was a delightful added touch
We've tried the tasting menu twice so feel we've given the place a chance and have concluded for the money, we do much better elsewhere
Design is fabulous, but the setting goes only so far
The food just didn't dazzle
When you're spending this kind of money, everything should be excellent
I have eaten here a few times now and every time I am more impressed by the quality of the food and service
It offers two lunch menus, a 3-course for $35 and a 4-course for $45, which are great values
Bouley designs the most unique-tasting and flavorful dishes
The sommelier is very knowledgeable and helpful with selecting wines and all of the staff is equally helpful and friendly
I can't wait to go back again!
I dined at Bouley last night for the first time since September 11, and it was absolutely fabulous
The renovation is marvelous
The room that was the bakery is now the best room in the house! Service was top-notch
George is divine! Food was magnificent
The seared foie gras was simply the best ever!: huge portion perfectly prepared
You must treat yourself and go!
I went for the prix fixe, 5-course lunch and had a truly AMAZING experience - - well worth the money
The service was prompt and friendly - - plates were cleared quickly and courses brought out in a timely fashion
The atmosphere was intimate yet not stuffy - - I was not crowded next to my neighbors at the next table and it wasn't too loud
The food was some of the best that I've had (and I've tried many restaurants) - - the portions were plentiful and we were stuffed by the 3rd course! They even brough out additional desserts at the end so we could try them and gave us boxes of chocolates to take home with us
A VERY nice and elegant lunch - - highly recommend
The $35 tasting menu for lunch is undoubtedly the best deal in town
This restaurant fires on all cylinders
great food, service and ambiance
Will come back again for dinner next time we are in town
I went with 5 other people over the weekend was not impressed
A lot of fusion tastes that unfortantly doesn't work
This place is overrated not worth the price
Service was very attentive informative though
There's a neon sign that reads good food in the window
That's what they serve here
Everything is good
$3
50 is worth it for a tasty empanada in SoHo
The service is also really friendly
They make it feel like a real neighborhood place
Thanks Mo!
they have awesome empanadas
but i think they're a bit too pricey
$3
50-$4
00 for a rather small empanada is pretty expensive, considering the fact that it is more a take-out kind of place than an actual restaurant
Had 2 empanadas that were very good
I probably need to eat 3 to satisfy my lunchtime hunger
I understand the need to charge more because of the location, but $3
50 is a bit much for one empanada that's smaller than a beef patty
I'll go back when I'm in the mood for a little something
Best empanadas in town, hands down
Friendly staff, to boot
Check this place out!
The Scene A vaguely Russian vibe marks Palacinka, a popular crepe and sandwich place at a far western intersection of Soho and Tribeca
The stark dining room features grey walls and communal seating at narrow metal tables--despite the tight quarters, the mood is cheerful
An extremely efficient waitress works the room, plopping a huge glass bottle of water down as each table is set
The Food Palacinka means "little pancake," or crepe, in Croatian, and this eatery cooks up some of the best around, with excellent choices like ham, gruyere and tomato or a fresh-tasting lemon tart for dessert
Palacinka also offers excellent salads, like its roasted chicken with fresh orange, Asiago, toasted almonds and mixed greens, and well-made sandwiches, such as the merguez with goat cheese and a black olive tapenade
Very nice little place, candles, low tables or high window seats
Nothing much to see out of the window but the waiter was a cutie
I am a fresh lemonade freak and theirs was perfect
I had a pressed sandwich: rosemary chicken, was it gruyere cheese? and tomatoes
It was simply delicious
Regulation arugula salad w/balsamic vinaigrette
Crepe dishes were excellent freshly made
Service was attentive without being pushy
I went there last Friday evening and the waitress did not hurry us out
We chilled, ate had a few glasses of wine over 3 hours!
this is a great place for a bite to eat and also a place to linger after work
perfect this time of year because the whole front can be opened up to the fresh air
great decor, great music - the owners have just opened another similar place in soho
Yummy crepes, tiny place, not a place to linger, but great value
A mouthwatering scent wafted out as I entered the restaurant for the 1st time last weekend with 2 friends
Service was excellent, though she gave me a hot mocha instead of an Iced Mocha
but that was quickly fixed! Tried the crepe stuffed with Portabello Mushrooms, roasted potatoes, mozzarella and pesto
Excellent!!! It was very light and came with a small mixed green salad that was crisp and balanced off the crepe nicely
the space is limited at palacinka, but everything else about the place is great
had the tiger shrimp, black bean paste basil crme frache crpe, which was out of this world
the prices are reasonable, the service is very friendly
the friends i ate with were similarly enthusiastic about their meals
i highly recommend 'palacinka'
I went there last saturday night with a small group of friends and had the best time

Only problem was service-luckily we had 2 hours!
Went Saturday at noon
Not crowded, excellent service (my requests, that are typically forgotten in other places, weren't here), great (if pricey) lobster sandwich
Probably a zoo during the theater rush
food was just okay, desserts were great! love the desserts, like the live jazz:) It's a great place to go after work, not for the dinner but for the drinks and desserts
Fresh sushi, good service, a bit expensive, but value was commensurate with what you are getting
A great place to dine after work
Entered, was ignored by the host
Requested a seat at the sushi bar, and he seemed puzzled
(In Japan, the counter is the best seat
)  A waiter approached
Nigiri sushi and sashimi were listed on the menu
Asked if the chef could prepare 'maki'
He responded by saying he didn't know what maki meant! Maki, of course, are the standard hand rolls available at every sushi bar
Ordered two maki and two specials
A busboy brought a basket of bread to the sushi counter
A first
The order arrived
The two maki were combined into a double, not what I asked for
The specials were 'inside-out' rolls, an important point not detailed on the menu
Stephen Hanson is playing 'sushi restaurant owner', the way little girls play house
An awful experience
Afterwards, went to Kinokuniya and ordered a sandwich
The bookstore had better service and food then Blue Fin
The food was great - best Sea Bass I've ever had - although the sushi was far too expensive (it was good though) for the presentation and portions served
Seared tuna was excellent as well
- I sat downstairs
although upstairs looked better
Party of 4 after a Sunday matinee, no reservation, seated promtply, but service was slow
Food was tasty and fresh, but portions are small
We had sushi, salad, seared tuna, chilean sea bass grilled salmon
Extensive selection of wine, but watchout for those wine prices! Insane markups on most selections
Apple-almond and banana praline tarts were delicious
Ladies room was in desperate need of tidying
went for pre-theater meal sat at sushi bar as place was packed
sushi very good, appeteasers excellent (foie gras!) entrees avg
( hi expectations not met, had better chilian sea bass elsewhere)
but, yasu served us well at the sushi bar, asked for his fresh fish specials he came thru
svc
not so attentive tho we mentioned we're off to a play (they were busy but still
) maitre'd tried to take care of us tho but we ran late
did tour restaurant on way to out of the way men's room, place is huge/several separate dining settings
bar scene upstairs, like a meat mkt
outsiders can view front bar all glass scene or join in the crowd - but do go early
SUM IT: must try at least once but expect to pay premium prices
large selection makes mouth water
sit at sushi bar for more attentive svc
Best for the sushi and oysters, so time your visit right after a delivery from the fish market
Atmosphere was mixed; alot of broadway show luvvies, post theatre crowd, and a three top of trannies (???) right next to us
Lounge act upstairs played bizarre renditions of John Lennon and Radiohead songs
Its a little 'New York Fabu' for tourists
Big and flashy, but without the scene
Just go for the raw bar, and then head downtown for drinks afterwards
Good for your out of town guests who want the full Times Square experience
Blue Fin has delicious food with great presentation
Unlike most sushi restaurants, they have a much larger variety of dishes, and their cocktails are great too
This is definitely a great place to get dressed up and bring a date
Their decorational displays hanging from the walls and ceiling are incredibly impressive
Pretty on the outside, and the food's great too
Not an easy combination to find
Great for a large group or dinner for 2
This is by far one of the best if not the best restaurant in Times Square
The food is excellent and you must have the Blue Fin martini - enough to get every color fish! The creme brulee is a must for desert - they even have a pistachio flavor (YUMMY)
Come here late enough for the live music which is awesome every time
Blue Fin is a winner
Seated upstairs promptly, courteously
Decor is amazing upstairs
Waiter was fabulous!! Friendly, helpful
Help with wine list by a knowledgeable security guard in a suit!!! Food was delicious, delivered in a timely manner
Three piece band; piano, bass, drums, great background music! Noise level is not outrageous as reported by others
Great food, wine, decor and service
What more do you want???
Blue Fin is a wonderful restaurant
The food is delicious
The sushi chef offers a great array of choices, the fish is fresh and the dishes are unbelievably flavorful
This is a great place to visit especially if you find yourself in Time Square
I have yet to visit a Steve Hanson restaurant that I don't love
I've eaten at Blue Fin a number of times and the food is always excellent
The chef invents innovative food creations that constantly change with the seasons
The stuffed baby pumpkin I had around Thanksgiving was so delicious
And just recently the sole over spinach was perfect
The great food mixed with cool decor and live music makes this place one of my favorite restaurants
You can have a drink before dinner at the bar that separates you from Times Square by a wall of glass
It's a great place for entertaining or for a fun date
Blue Fin is my favorite place to eat in NYC! Fun, trendy atmosphere and the food is unbelievable!! I recommend the Chilean Sea Bass and good old fashioned California Roll! You will never be satisfied with ordinary sushi places again
Great drinks too!
Food was good, service was below average and the atmosphere was too stuffy
If your looking for a place to have a nice dinner, relax while there and feel like you belong, then don't go to the Blue Fin
In the middle of times square this restaurant would do much better in an off the beaten path location
It has an incredible decor and beautiful restaurant
There were all sorts of people there, families couples and large groups all enjoying the atomsphere
Though very loud with all the people and live music, the sushi was probably the best I have had
Were else do you see Lobster and sea bass rolls on a sushi menu? Our service was outstanding, but we ate at midnight
Great place for Sunday brunch! Close to all the theatres so its a good place to grab a bite to eat before or after a show
Menu is a blend of east and west
Just fantastic
Arrived late for our pre-theater dinner, however, service was exceptionally quick and the kitchen had our meals prepared in very quick time
The Maine scallops were delicious, and the lobster/crab chowder was exceptional
Decor is very classy
Only drawback is the sound level - quite a loud space downstairs - and that might be accounted for with their trendy bar and right off Times Square

Overall, I would not say the food was excellent, but it was pretty good, and very inexpensive
I think the Ali-Baba restaurant is a better value - a bit more expensive but better
I was hungry and had some time to kill so I stopped in to this little turkish place
I tried the humas It seemed very dry
like it was sitting out for a while
the chicken was my main course and a similar result
dry on the inside almost over cooked
anyway
no atmosphere and very plain
A buddy I met there yesterday after work and were completely impressed
Since we weren't too hungry, we ordered five appetizers and the lamb shank special ate tapas style
The food was absolutely delicious without being too filling
We've decided to make that a regular staple in our gastronomic tour of NYC
One night my wife and I were loking for a cozy little sit down place in our neighborhood and remmembered an old place we went to over this past winter, Efendi
when we went back the name was changed, but the place looked the same
so we tried it
Was NOT even close
we were VERY DISAPPOINTED
the mussakka was horrible
and the humas was chucky
I can not recommend it to anyone, sorry
Taksim has terrific food and prices are reasonable
Staff is always accomodating, even when harried, which is most of the tiime
Great donner sandwiches, spicy chicken, other hot dishes and their mezzes
Hummus is one of the best in the city, very fresh
Same with their cold artichokes and rice pudding
This place is fantastic!!!! The food just melts in your mouth
The bread is out of this world! The sevice is great
I was happy we tried it
we would go back again in a heartbeat!
Upon moving into the neighborhood less than six months ago, my husband and I were excited when Taksim opened it's doors
Weve gone for a quick lunch, and weve gone with a larger group for a dinner
It's great for any occasion!!! From the great food to the great hospitality, it's quite obvious that these people love what they are doing
Their prices are relatively fair too
It's a rare find in the neighborhood let alone New York City
I recently dined at Taksim with two of my friends and can certainly assure you that well be back for more! We were warmly welcomed into the cozy restaurant filled with coppers, dark wood, and Mediterranean blues and yellows
The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and also proved to be helpful in providing recommendations and explaining the dishes
For Turkish Mezze (appetizers), we had Hummus and Grape Leaves and continued to indulge ourselves with the Musakka, Stuffed Cabbage, and a variety of grilled meats for our entrees
Since there are no additional cork fees, I would highly recommend picking up your favorite bottle of wine to further enhance your dining experience
Save room for dessert followed up with a Turkish tea or coffee!
Taksim has got it right
it's proper Turkish food, not a homogenized or dumbed down version for the American pallette
It's authentic, delicious, and the portions are generous
I think the best way to enjoy Taksim is with a few friends so you can sample a little bit of everything
And if you need a recommendation, the friendly staff are more than happy to make suggestions or explain the dishes
Don't miss out on the special warm Turkish bread
I've even requested having it shipped to me in Connecticut!
The Scene A neighborhood dinner-and-date crowd morphs into a singles scene as the night wears on and the DJ gets going
The hopping classic-style bar is backed by an antique mirror; leather chairs sidle up to tables; and low clubby seating flanks the bar
A harried staff does its best to accommodate but is often distracted
The Food The menu makes liberal use of Latin and Asian flavors; steer to the south for the more satisfying experience
Start with seafood empanadas, bursting with a medley of fish, or the shrimp with honey-guava dipping sauce, made savory by a crisped pork wrap
The roast duck, a simple affair of duck and salsa in a tortilla, matches well with a full-bodied wine
Entrees lack kick, but are serviceable: The tame coconut chicken arrives notably tender, and salmon gets help from a faint wasabi sauce
The pineapple-chorizo fried rice works best as a side dish
I went to Room 18 for my bday, and they said that they could accomodate a group of 20+ people
I went there a few minutes early to see how they set it up, but they did not set up yet even though the restaurant was empty
When I asked them where we would sit, the person in charge ignored me
Once they did set it up, they said that their table arrangement could accomodate 20 people
But it could not
A chunk of the evening was spent playing musical chairs and rearranging the tables so that everyone could find a place to sit
Some of my friends were not comfortable,and they did very little to make sure that they were
On the flip side, good food, good ambiance and the service got better once we had a different waiter
The food is amazing
Service was average, but still decent
Go there for tapas, there are unique tastes you don't get other places in the city
This place has character and really good food
contrary to a few of the reviews found here, i find the service to be extremely warm and friendly
room 18 has been a great addition to this neighborhood and fits right in
the regular crowd consists mostly of locals and we enjoy the inviting and cozy atmosphere that room 18 provides thanks in large part to the wonderful owners who are always on duty
the delicious tapas and wine selection is just the cherry on top!
Came here with my girl, and it was okay at best
The place may be romantic, but we were the only people in the place
Great place to be if you want to be by yourselves
Food was okay- typical bar food
greasy
Food is better next door

Rm
18 has a cozy romantic atmosphere that's very comfortable to enjoy myself in; whether I want to have a drink at the bar or get together with a group of friends for dinner, suitable accomodations are available
Their food is great! And the drinks are very unique + fresh
Best of all, their service is excellent!!
I love this place, the food is excellent and the employees there are just wonderful and sweet
I visited NY during the summer, and found myself becoming another regular
A really relaxing place to chill after a long days work or to hang out and mingle with your friends/family
The next time I come back, that'll be the first place I hit up and the last place to finish off the visit
on a last note: I LOVE YOU PETER AND JILL!!!!!
This place is a huge hit for me and my friends
Super cozy with from its lighting and atmosphere
Definitely love the brick walls! Food was great, a fusion in every little dish
A great sense of style
Not to noisy, its was great night for me and the girls
Girl talk all night! If you like a romantic date or just a plain night out, this is the place
Happened to stumble into Room 18 as it's tucked away between Cafe Lebowitz and Bread when a few girlfriends flew in for fashion week
A must go if you're looking for an atmosphere that's warm and sangria that's COLD!!  Packed when we arrived but the gracious owner, attentive staff, awesome drinks and delicious tapas made the wait worthwhile!!
Celebrated my 32nd birthday at Room 18 this year and couldn't ask for more

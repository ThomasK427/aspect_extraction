The food was excellent, the wait staff highly attentive without being overbearing, and the ambience is hard to beat
What I think set our meal apart from many of the other reviewers is the fact that we went for lunch on a monday
No crowds, no waiting
Everything was great
If you can manage to get there on a weekday, I would definitely recommend giving it a try
WE MADE RESERVATIONS FOR CHRISTMAS EVE - 4 ADULTS 2 CHILDREN - OUR BILL WAS $650
00
THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE
WE WERE HERDED IN LIKE CATTLE, RUSHED THROUGHOUT THE MEAL, THEY BROUGHT BUTTER AND NO BREAD, SALAD AND NO HAND GROUND PEPPERS, AND THE LIST GOES ON
I WOULD NEVER GO BACK, NOR RECOMMEND IT
YOU ARE BETTER JUST GOING TO SEE THE PLACE AND NOT EATING
It's a beautiful restaurant
Definitely go there for a drink or just to see it, but don't waste your money on the food
It was completely overpriced for what I would consider mediocre at best food
I came here with friends expecting great service and great food but instead got the exact opposite
The management here should be fired
They are driving this NYC landmark into the ground
I can't beleive how many bad reviews are here and it's too bad I have to add a bad one as well
Do NOT spend your hard-earned money here expecting to get what you pay for
It is a rip-off
Trust the bad reviews - they know what they are talking about
I've had better food from the freezer section at the AP
I wish I had better news, but it's time for the Tavern to step up to the plate
The food was horrible; the service was just okay and the decor made me nauseous
Honestly -- it was awful
It's such a shame that this great institution has gone downhill so much
And the prices are SO HIGH! I mean, $36 for turkey and stuffing? Come on! I hope someone can fix this place up before it's too late
I'm sorry to annouce that it is time for the TOTG to either improve their below-average food, service and decor - or just do us all a favor and close down
There is no way the food and service here are worth the prices they charge
When I went for sunday brunch, not only was the food bland and cold, they didn't even bother to clear the plates once they brought the bill
If you are willing to pay this kind of money for dinner - do the right thing and go to a place that respects it's clientle and has actually EARNED a good reputation
I went as part of a group of 12
We were sitting at two nearby tables for 6
We had a reservation, but still had to wait for about 45 minutes in a hot crowded tent
The food was good, but not outstanding
The service did not follow proper etiquette
It reminded me a a cruise ship dining room
I unitentionally humiliated myself by bringing my out-of-town family here for brunch the sunday after Thanksgiving
They now think I am a complete idiot for telling them they would enjoy a great NYC experience here
They got nothing but lost reservations, rude service and terrible food
The place was too crowded and noisy to enjoy any conversation
We were all pretty disappointed
I was stupid and didn't bother to pay attention to all the bad reviews here - but they were right
That's $200 I'll never see again
I should have bought lottery tickets
You could not find a better place to eat horrible food and waste vast amounts of money
You'd be better off donating $300 to charity and then eating at a deli
If you like rude service and dirty silverware, this is the place for you
If you enjoy ridiculous decor and worn out, food stained furniture, you will enjoy it here! Make sure you request one of their wonderful rickety folding card tables with cheap tablecloth next to a bitter cold breezy hallway! You would probably be well advised to bring some sort of portable microwave device, as food generally arrives cold and undercooked, and the waiters are well trained in the Houdini art of dissapearance! A good place to recommend to people you hate
This place is overpriced, understaffed and dirty
The food is bland, of poor quality and of dubious origin
I've been to plenty of bad restaurants in NYC - but this place takes the cake
I expect impeccable service and food for the prices they charge
I would not recommend Tavern on the Green to anybody
Find yourself a small place with a reputation based on reality, not legend
Evenrone in NY said we had to eat at Tavern during our first visit to NYC
THe food was cold, and un-tasty
The service was non existent
Compensation is not an option when you receive such horrible service
We tried that
Just say no thanks to Tavern
Sure, it's nice inside, but that's about it! Does not hold up to it's reputation at all!
I'll never go back to Tavern and I'll make sure to advise all my friends to avoid the place
For such an expensive place, their service, food and decor just don't justify the expense
I went there with family and even though we had reservations, we were seated 30 minutes late, the food took 45 minutes to arrive and when I got the wrong order, I had a hard time trying to find the server
The service staff treats the customers as if they are a great annoyance
The room we sat in was run down and dirty
I've had better food at a hotdog cart
I can understand the appeal of seeing this landmark one time but I would not go back
Went there for Sunday brunch, decor was outdated, the room where we were served was not very clean, the service was unfortunately well below average, we waited long periods of time for our orders and when they finally did come they were cool-warm in temperature and in some cases, not what we asked for
I was underwhelmed and disappointed
every tourist must visit once, but only a masochist would go again
terrible decor, awful service, decent but overpriced food
I think they are skating by on an old reputation that is no longer deserved
The food was average, and the service was non-existent
I had to hunt down a waiter just to get a glass of water
and then it was never re-filled
Taking my order seemed like an annoyance to my server - who commented that they have to serve 1800 guests that day, so he didn't have time to answer my questions
I don't mind paying for an expensive dining experience
but one does expect a certain level of service to come with the dining cost!
I took my family to a sunday brunch
The service was horrible
The wait staff was wearing dirty, stained uniforms
The food was horrible and horribly overpriced
for $29 I got the turkey plate which came with one slice of white meat and the rest was dark meat with a lot of gristle
The wait staff was rude and ingnored everybody
They couldn't even keep a glass of water filled and never bothered to ask how the meal was
Do youself a favor and skip this place, go the the View at the Marriot Marquis instead
I came to Tavern on the Green every Christmas season growing up and recently returned only to find that my favorite childhood place had turned into a dump
I was so dissapointed to find stains on the furnitire, mediocre yet incredibly expensive food, a waitstaff hustling so rapidly, you were lucky if you got even one question in
This is still a great place for children who can more easily ingnore the downfalls I so easily noticed
I hope they revamp this place soon, as it brought me wonderful memories at one time and I hope it could do the same for others
Great experience at Tavern on the Green
I took a friend, who had never been to New York, for her birthday
We had a wonderful brunch with a very friendly and attentive waiter
It was a great dining experience
I would recommend Tavern on the Green to anyone visiting or moving to the area
Tavern on the Green is awful
When I made my reservation, I mentioned that it was my grandmother's 80th birthday and asked for a particular room
When I arrived (for my 5 pm reservation), I was brought to a different room

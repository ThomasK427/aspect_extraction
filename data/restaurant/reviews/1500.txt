Save yourself several hundred dollars and go elsewhere
When you feel like eating again an hour later (portions are small) at least you won't feel as regretful about ordering take-out
While I have dined at Mr Chow Uptown numerous times, Mr
Chow downtown seriously pales in comparison
Dinner for two with a few glasses of wine - upwards of $400
I have a litany of complaints -- being over-charged for wine that I didn't order, shady waiters, so-so food that arrived at the table luke warm, main course portion sizes barely large enough to be appetizer sizes, lack of fabulosity that Mr
Chow Uptown exude -- I could go on
Dont waste your time -- it's awful
First of all, it's very hard to get in
You have to make a reservation wayyyyyyyy ahead in order to eat there
The Restaurant is THE most beautiful restaurant in the City
Food is amazing, Service is superb
Lots of celebrities
MR CHOW IT IS THE PLACE TO BE !!!
This place is straight from Chinatown
No ingenuity, just better ingredients -- bigger shrimp, free-range chicken, etc
Save your money for something better
They do have a nice looking bar downstairs with an impressive koi pond
It hasn't become that popular yet so it looks like a good place to go with a big group of friends for a few drinks
As for the food, take a cab downtown for the real thing
This place was so much fun, drinks are excellent, great atmosphere, good service and good food, what more do you need?
Great big loud fun place
Excellent, but not world shaking dim sum
Other dishes, Cantonese/Asian Fusion, I found largely bland and uninspired
Decent peking duck but hard to eat at tiny table for two
Staff needs to learn the dishesingredients and preparationand also what condiments to serve
Place was hopping on all three visits I made, apparently the experience of going out to Chinatown Brasserie was more important than the culinary experience to be found there
Convenient for those of us who want dim sum but don't want to go all the way down to Chinatown
But if the menu doesn't begin to sparkle and the staff doesn't learn its job, I don't know how long the novelty will last
I heard that this spot was opening up in June so I took a few friends there during opening week
For a brand new restaurant everyone did a great job! The service was excellent - a little eager but that was expected
We had several appetizers: lettuce wrap with chicken and pinenuts, shu mai, soup dumplings, wonton soup - all excellent! I had the crispy bass in chili sauce which was succulent and well balanced
The ambiance reminds me of a Chinese restaurant in the 1920s
or at least my fantasy of a Chinese restaurant in the 1920s
Basically, it's a huge space that has been well decorated in a classy style - giant Asian chandeliers, red and black furniture, bamboo
Can't wait to go back! Pretty, pretty and yum, yum!
I gave Chinatown Brasserie a run last night
The space it decent - Bill Georgis did a reasonable job with the interior and the downstairs lounge (the koi pool is quite interesting and being around water in a bar is refreshing)
When my party arrived, we ordered several Lychee martinis which were good, albeit expensive
My gin and tonic was ten dollars which is pricey as well for a simple mixed drink
One of the bartenders, a gentlemen from South Williamsburg, did make the very nice gesture of providing our party with a complimentary 4 piece dim sum appetizer which was quite nice after paying so much for the cocktails
The waiter we had was a young gentleman who seemed inexperienced in the service business and had somewhat of a hurried attitude which was lamentable
The menu is not very well organized - kind of a mock-Keith McNally-ish presentation
Aesthically it's not interesting either
We ordered another round of cocktails, this time myself ordering a MaiTai which was quite good
We ordered 5 appetizers and 2 main dishes
The appetizers were good; a chicken roll presented on it's end in four pieces, pork soup dumplings (very good) egetable dumplings, shrimp dumplings
Nothing incredible in terms of taste
The main courses of sea bass and flatiron steak were good - the sea bass was quite succulent and had a buttery taste which I liked
The steak was a decent serving for 17 dollars, sliced and tasted decent
We finished feeling hungry, and the waiter should have told us that the food were ordered was not enough for the table
For dessert, we had a peanut butter pie, rhubarb pie, and a chocolate cake
All were very light and not very fulfilling
Given the neighborhood, Great Jones/Bond St area, I would say that Chinatown Brasserie is certainly a fair place for exotic cocktails in the summer to complement your Dim Sum / Dumpling appetite
The restaurant is nicely designed (great fish pond) and the staff very eager
Food is decent to very good
Nothing super exciting
Enjoyed the pork soup dumplings
Other dumplings not as good
Watercress dumplings had shrimp in them, which seemed a bit lazy and not at all what I wanted in there
Not listed on the menu either
Cocktails looked good but it was lunch so we abstained
Might check out the bar again, but menu didn't seem terribly appealing
The ambience and service is AMAZING
For the price, you really can't beat it in that neighborhood, and even though you think of Chinese food as being delivery, eat at home on the couch food, it was soooo good
Oh, and get the Chinese sundae for dessert - it was FANTASTIC! Plus - celeb watching spot
Saw the guy who played Trey (Charlotte's 1st husband) on Sex the City!
I just ate at Zip last week and had quite the experience
The classic is well, classic
If you like Burgers prepared perfectly Zip is the place for you
The classic softy bun was grilled on the inside with a touch of butter
Nice and crisp yet still soft on the outside
(this keeps the bun from falling apart and tastes great too) I added a slice of american, some onion, ketchup, and some creamy homemade mayo
The beef was a perect well seasoned medium rare
Sooooo good! Don't forget the authentic Belgian style fries with the mayo
They are the real deal!! Twice fried and super crisp
The tangy mayo is a must with the fries
If you still have room add a shake to the meal
They are made with real fruit extract
I've read a few reviews complaining about the prices
A fresh made to order burger with real home made belgian style fries and a milk shake for about 12 bucks
Hey, it's New York
Any meal at that price is cheap
Deal with it
Trust me, you will be back for more
A friend arrived late from a flight from LA and was hungry for a light meal before bed
We popped over to Zip because I had heard good things about it (I work and live 2 blocks away) and they advertise that they are open late
We walked in about 11:45 p
m
and asked if they were still open
We were told they were and placed our order ($25 worth of burgers, fries, drinks), being asked For here or to go
I said For here (I live in a small studio not suitable for eating with guests), the food started coming, we started heading upstairs to the only sit-down dining area and were told that the dining area was closed
Okay, where should we eat? The fellow at the counter (otherwise pleasant) said we could eat downstairs standing up
I told him that was not acceptable but he offered no other choices so we cancelled our order and left for a neighborhood diner
It shouldn't have been too hard for them to let us use a table and 2 chairs for 15 minutes
The owner may not know what is happening at his restaurant late at night
Given the size of the crowds during the opening week, I was not the only one eager to try my first Zip Burger
The classic burger is far better than anything I could ever grill for myself and I will be going back to try to salmon and turkey burgers soon
No matter what, have the Belgian fries
They alone make it worth the trip

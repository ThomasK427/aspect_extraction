I spent the evening of Sat, Jan 28, 2006 at SEA with a large group of friends
We enjoyed some well-prepared drinks from an already busy set of bartenders who were attentive and upbeat with our orders
After 45 minutes, we sat down and gave in our order from a pre-selected menu which was both economic for us and headache free for the chefs
Careful with what you select, this is afterall Thai cuisine and a bit spicy
The appetizers and entree's were excellent
The music sounds tribal as you enter, you'll notice a large Buddha overlooking a calming pool with tables set up
Iin a corner you have these small tables and chairs to enjoy your drink while waiting to be seated
And over on the right is where we ordered our drinks at the bar
My friends and I had a wonderful time and look forward to returning
I am from out of town and was visitng some friends who live on Staten Island
They suggested that we go to this place because it is trendy and they enjoy the food
So we went on a Friday night, which caused us to have a two hour wait
It was well worth the wait once we got to the table and got our food
The wait was a little tiring because it was late at night and we had spent the day in the city
We enjoyed the atmosphere
the decorations were amazing and I very much enjoyed the pork that i had
It was an amazing experience for my first time in the NYC area
I went on 12/23/05 had a blast-Surprise for my b-day from my girlfriends, I didn't know Bklyn had places like this, they don't take reservations had to wait 30-45 mins, but you can chill at the bar
Off the hook atmosphere, great music
It was packed to the gills in there
The quickest service I ever had, no time for the food to come out, that helped after waiting to get in
We order 5 app-and 3 main dishes and 3 drinks all for $70 bucks!!!!!!! This is the place to be--great for a group of peoples to chill!!!! Bathrooms are confusing- they look like portals-inside has monitors of the people outside-Fun fun fun I found a new place to hang that is cool and cheap!!!!!!!!!
I have been to Sea twice in less than 3 weeks and besides the ambience and decor, the food quality, price and creativity is what made me go back
The place has a wide open arrangement with a big pool in the center flanked by a female buddha (or something like that)
The meny is varied, simple and most importantly, delicious!   A DJ surrounds the place with cool asian vibes from popular compilations like Buddha Bar and Chill Out in Paris, which generally provide for great dinign music
One cannot help it to compare this plac with more stablish restaurants in Manhattan like Tao or Spice Market
I personally think this is a gem which, in spite of its already big following in Brooklyn, is waiting to be discovered by a broader audience
This place is place was awesome
The food comes out so fast, you can order appetizers and enjoy them while you're still looking at the menu
It's easy to kind of order as you go along because you don't have to wait too much
The service is great, the menu is fairly large, it is inexpensive and a good place to go on a date
I enjoyed this place
When I walked in I thought it was a club at first but after seeing the whole set up I was pleased
They've got more than enough space for a large group or even a party
The decor was fabulous! The service was a little slow, but to be expected, it was a little crowded for a Thursday night
My date was a regular here so he suggested a few winners
Try the Tum Tip Fritters, very good, and the pork chops were great
The bartender created the worst Mojito ever though
It was so sour, with almost no alcohol
But the other drinks were pretty good, like the Pineapple-ginger martini
All in all, a great find!!!!
This place was AWESOME!! The food and drinks were amazing, the wait staff was great
The bartenders could have been a lot nicer but the drinks they shook up kind of made up for their poor attitude
The atmosphere is the best I have ever eaten in
I went with 3 other people we all didn;t want to leave! We are already talking abtout the next time we can go back
When i walked, I figured a place this nice must be pricey
the most expensive dish on the menu was $14!!! I was in shock
This place ROCKS!
Sea has the BEST pineapple fried rice with tofu I have ever tasted
Ever
The tofu is sweet and moist, and their prices are surprisingly low
The seating arrangements are even cooler
They also have individual bathrooms with TV sets in them
This was my 1st time at this restaurant, and I was there for a birthday party
Here is what I will say the food was amazing and very affordable
The service was awful! The hostess was obnoxious and rude and we had to flag down a server after sitting for 20 min just to place a drink order
As much as I enjoyed the food I would never go back which is really sad, but this is New York and there are PLENTY of other great restaurants minus the attitude!
I went to this restaurant, and it was great
It has great Trance music and an amazing ambience, the food was good and the price was good! I highly recommend this for a dinner party or a romantic date!
Gotta love the fusion in Willie B nowadays
Been going to Sea since 2003
Love the scene, great mojito's and Rasberry Cosmos
Yummy Jade dumplings and tasty tim-tum fritters! The food is not as tasty as few yrs ago, the service is quick, and the scene can be loud on the weekends
They dont take reservation for parties under 8
so it can be a long wait for a table
Is it worth it to wait? not anymore
VERY INEXPENSIVE!
I would highly recommend this place to everyone
Yes it does get a bit crowded but have a reservation to avoid that, I was seated in a timely manner with a reservation
The food is average and the prices are extremely affordable
This place is all about ambience not the food, services or anything else
The atmosphere makes it all worth while
Great date place!!!
Don't listen to all the bad reviews
This is a wonderful place
I have been there at least 10 times
And I live about 40 minutes from Sea
Parking is a pain in the neck every time
The wait is long, about 20-40 min depending on the size of your group
And you know what despite the traveling, the parking, and the wait, I love it every single time and keep coming back
An average meal per person including a drink, an appetizer, main course, and dessert, tax and tip will cost about $40
The atmosphere is better then good, the staff can sometimes be a little rude, but forgivable
Make sure to check out the bathroom (with cameras overseeing the restaurant)
Once again I love it I love it I love it and would recomend it to anyone and everyone
Make sure to check it out
Sea was reccommended to me by a friend
I was a little nervous because I brought a group of people and I never ate there before
The food was amazing and affordable
The decor is just what I like
There is a wait though but it is well worth it
Went on a Wed
night for a double date
Went for drinks and apptzrs
Had to wait a little bit for a table
The atmosphere was great - people were a little weird - loved the swing and the moon chair
Overall apptzers were really good and really cheap
The food came out really quick and the service overall was not bad
Great place in bklyn
Can't wait to go back!
The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes

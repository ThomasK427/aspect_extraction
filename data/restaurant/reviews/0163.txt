The manager didn't even apologize to us because he was so preoccupied with 5 other angry tables
We would not go back here if they paid me to eat
The citysearch review is out of date
The cuisine is not French/Morrocan, it is Italian and limited to maybe 6 entrees to choose from
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were
We sat in the tented Garden, which consisted of 2 fern plants
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable
It was heated, but diners wore their coats throughout their meal
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with
This is a casual cafe
Not terrible, but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite
Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts
The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I've had
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere
Kind, attentive wait staff
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!)
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos
Delicious crab cakes too
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax
Great neighborhood joint
The Scene This culinary paean to Austria is unabashedly understated with its small square tables and midnight blue banquettes
However, the selections from Julian Schnabel's private collection of contemporary art, which hang unobtrusively on the dining room walls, has made Wallse a destination for art lovers
Most of the dishes--like the decor--are well-behaved, not provocatively sensational
The Food The nouveau variations on Austria's solid cuisine tend to all things creamy
Less rich old-world stalwarts fare better: The wiener schnitzel made from veal is served with a summery cool potato-cucumber salad and tangy-sweet lingonberries
Any dish that includes Wallse's delectably mild horseradish sauce is also recommended
Traditional fare like spaetzle (akin to gnocchi), kohlrabi (a kind of turnip) and any fish entree can be blandly buttery
My friends and I had a reservation here on a Tuesday night and were seated right away
The wine selection was excellent and our sommelier was very knowledgeable and accommodating
Every dish that was delivered was superb
The wienerschnitzl (sp?) was delightful and the fish was very flavorful and cooked to perfection
Our waitress (and the chef himself) helped us a bit with the Austrian cuisine where we had questions, and every recommendation was right on
Julian Schnabel's artwork is also scattered throughout the restaurant, adding to an otherwise sparse aesthetic, but especially after dark, the dim lighting and candlelit tables make for a romantic ambiance
Only thing that could use improving is the desserts - not quite as impressive as the rest of the meal
I would definitely recommend Wallse, and plan on trying THOR, the chef's new restaurant recently opened in the Hotel on Rivington
after reading the reviews on here I was unsure of keeping our reservation on saturday, but we went anyway
the restaurant is in a great location and gives a great impression when you first walk in
it's just a shame the food let's it down
i had the foie gras terrine to start which was flavourless escept for the cherries and for entree the steamed halibut which was overcooked and the cucumber, dill sauce was too watery and just tasted of cucumber
the only plus was the excellent gerhart who suggested a great wine and ensured the kitchen had sorbet on the menu for my fiance, but other than that we would not return, especially at $220 for 2 people with only 1 having desert!!
The food was fabulous! Our waitress was SUB PAR
When we refused to order any wine, and said we'd liked to order our food, she proceeded to turn to the next table and take THEIR order! Then she left, and didnt come back for what seemed like forever
Forever considering we had just said we were ready to order! I purposely ordered less food so that her tip was a small as possible
On top of that the busboy took care of our table more than she did
All because we didnt order wine?
Took my wife to Wallse over the weekend for our anniversary
I called earlier in the week to see if the pastry could prepare something special for us and they were more then accomodating
To my wives suprise there was a lovely, personalized chocolate cake placed on our table at the end of the night and it was delicious
All of the food leading up to this was also spectacular
The hostess was warm and inviting and really made an effort to make our dinner memorable
Thank you Wallse for a truly special night
Went to Wallse for a business meeting
The Wine Gru - Aldo - helped me choose a beautiful red wine - it was a perfect compliment to my lamb
dessert - was out of this world - To anybody who wished to go to Wallse - i would like to recommend Salzburger nockerl
Tip my hat to the staff
thank you for a very great evening
A group of us went for dinner to Walls on 5/14/05 and was pleasantly surprised with the experience
We had a $65 prix fixe menu and 3 bottles of wine
Food and presentation were excellent and found the waiters attentive
Would consider going back and trying their brunch menu
Cold, inattentive, distracted service and just slightly above average food
It was certainly tasty, but nothing daring or creative
Hey waiter, cool it with the relentless push to upsell the bottled water, already
Reservations at 9P on a weeknight
I was visibly pregnant and they kept me and my party standing at the bar for OVER AN HOUR with NOT even an apology
Staff was oblivious, bartender downright rude
Once seated had to ask 4 times for water and bread
Supposedly famous wienerschnitzel was a JOKE
Had the audacity to ask how everything was at the end of the meal
NEVER AGAIN
It drives me insane when some yahoo gives a restaurant a poor review for charging high prices
Here's a news flash for those living on Mars: a high-end restaurant in NYC charges $10-20 for appetizers, $20-40 entrees, $6-10 dessert
One must accept this concept and then judge whether the meal was worth this NYC standard
Recently, I had a wonderful meal at Wallse
The trout-pallachinke appetizer was solid
The braised rabbit-spetzle appetizer was rich and creamy, but suffered from a little too much tarragon and dill
The venison goulash was rich, savory, earthy, and paired beautifully with cheesy spetzle
The venison loin was simply spectacular: 2 impressively-sized, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked medallions bathed in an elderberry reduction sauce
An outstanding bottle of Austrian red (~$50) and a text-book example of apple strudel rounded out the meal
Service was friendly, helpful, and efficient
Overall, a fair value for an excellent meal
I too had great expectations for Wallse
Indeed the food was very good
We had the tasting menu and wine pairing, which apparently not many people order, because the wait staff forgot wine and a mise en place for one of the courses
Even without this hiccup, the service seemed very amateur--not snooty, as I've read in other reviews--just nowhere near as good as it should be given the price of the meal
I also did not care for the room
Found it perfectly charmless and definitely not romantic
I must say that after having fairly high expectations for my meal at Wallse, I was extremely dissapointed
The services was snooty (including the manager) and the prices were over the top given the quality of food
Especially considering the expense of the meal, I would highly reccomend dining elsewhere
I had a truly wonderful meal at Wallse and highly recommend it to everyone

Steak:  We had the Porter House
It was bland and tasteless as if it was par-boiled before broiling
Keylime Pie: Was Good
Service: The Waiter was obnoxious but efficient
Conclusion: We took the Steak Bone home for the dog but decided to throw it away
I've been a 837 member for years and go to other restaurants but always come back to the Palm
It is simply the best if you like Steak, Veal, and atmosphere
The specials are outstanding and everything you put in your mouth is pure heaven
The West Side Palm is also the best Palm I've been to in the Country!! These guys are at the top of their game
Say hi to Chris at the bar if you want the best drinks in town too
We had pre theater dinner here on February 20, 2004 and really enjoyed the food and ambiance
Palm's salads are the best and we had the heart of palm and Gigi to start
Our Manhattan and Gibson were served ice cold and huge! My filet mignon was perfectly cooked and the asparagus fritti is awesome as ever
Barbra loves the Veal Martini
Apple pie a la mode was the perfect finish to this great dinner
Nothing really needs to be said about this NY mainstay, other than simply great
The steaks are cooked to absolute perfection, the bar is fully stocked with food, and the waitstaff is made up of professionals
For larger parties spend the $150 for the private room, and definitely get the home fries
You'll be hard pressed to find a cut of meat as good as the ones they serve at Palm
We went to NYC and used Citysearch to plan out our restaurants
The Palm was, by far, our favorite place to eat! Since it was our first time there, our server made wonderful recommendations that turned out fabulous! (First timers get a free dessert, so tell them you're there for the first time!) The food was esquisite, which is high praise since I'm a great cook and hate going places unless it's better than my cooking! Highly recommended! We'll go back every time we can!
At Palm Westside, I've always found the steaks consistently fine, and the service friendly
However, my last of time there I was served by a waiter who was quite condesending
This waitperson spoke to me as if I'd never tasted red meat in my life, and almost scoffed at my choice of wine
My date was visibly irritated by all of this, but when our perfectly grilled steaks arrived, all was (almost) forgotten
We went labor day weekend (Friday) My husband had the ribeye, which he said was very good
I had the Filet(medium)
Lots of meat! My steak was crunchy outside, rare inside
The green beans were barely steamed and crunchy, and dry(boring!) I guess my expectations were too high and was mildly disappointed, also they don't need a bathroom attendant to put soap on your hands, it's not that high class a place!
The palm is a wonderful steakhouse with great steaks and a good price value ratio!!! My out of town friends love it, and have already requested that we go back next time their in town
The $95 dollar dinner for two is fabulous and probubly the best value for steak you can get in New York City!!!! But too bad it does'nt last past August
I recommend you try it!!! You'll like it!!!
The Scene Set up like a college lecture hall with three tiers overlooking a smoking wood-fired kitchen, this midtown lunch favorite is too decorous for jeans and too laid back for suits
Tables are well spaced, and the high ceiling seems to vent clatter
A mile-long bar a safe distance from the flames is ideal for solo dining
The Food Chef Waldy Malouf goes lumberjack here with skilled, incendiary cooking
He grills and rotisserie cooks everything that's not nailed down, including oysters
Among the best main courses are the roasted sucking pig with a thick crackly crust, spit-roasted duck and chicken and the massive T-bone steak that is perfectly charred and exceptionally tender
Swordfish benefits from a little blackening as well
A la carte vegetables are first-rate
I went to Beacon with my gf for restaurant week july 20, 2006
i was hoping it would be good given the high reviews here and in the NYTimes
However, i was sorely disappointed
my gf's filet was oversauced and the chicken i had was much too dry
the deserts were also subpar
the only decent dish was the oyster appetizers
the atmosphere is nice
but given the poor quality food and mediocre service your money is better spent elsewhere
I have eaten at Beacon several times and have never been disappointed
The service is very professional and they greet you at the door with a smile, which made me feel welcome, and like they were glad I was there, which is unusual in so many NY restaurants
The food is interesting and the portions are quite large
I have found the steaks here to be much better than the ones served at some of the big name steak houses
Overall, the food is very interesting and tasty
Our food was fabulous! Pizza was the best in town, oysters were fantastic, spinch was cooked perfectly, trout was out of this world and cocktails were so great we asked for the recipe! Met the chef and he was pleasant and answered all of our cooking questions
Hostess was friendly and polite (which you don't usually find in NY) Definately found a new favorite in Manhattan!
My Husband and I had purchased a theater package which included dinner at the Beacon on 1-28-06
BEWARE when ordering drinks! My husband was charged $16 for one glass of wine (he didn't order anything special and he does know his wine!) and to get an extra side vegtable was close to $20 for overdone asparagus that had no taste
We left the Beacon feeling taken advantage of
The food was average
We would not recommend the Beacon to anyone!
if you go as a large group demand that you be allowed to order off the menu
our group of 14 had the very bland and boring (1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 fish) prix fixe option
none of the entrees were up to par for a 4-star joint
the smoke oysters appetizer was out of this world, but few other dishes gained positive feedback
the staff was very accommodating for our large group
I went here for restaurant week lunch and was so pleased to see they had a veggie entree on their 20
12 menu
then when my friend's meat was overcooked (a filet mignon) another, correctly cooked, dish was quickly supplimented
(yes, not substituted)
the support staff were like samurai- your water was refilled, dishes were placed and removed, etc without you even noticing, which is good because when you looked up you would realize how frantic these guys were just to serve you!
Lucky for me, I didn't read most of the reviews below until after dining here
I don't know if the staff has perhaps changed over or if other people went on a bad night (or maybe I went on a great night)
Anyway, the space is absolutely beautiful but not in a pretentious way
I felt very comfortable dressed casually
The service was very friendly and professional
There when needed, but not overly fussy
The menu is very large and very interesting
The steaks are amongst the best I've had and the suckling pig that they roast in the open kitchen on the rotisserie was tender and flavorful
Some below were saying that this restaurant in pricey, but that may be a clue to their poor reviews
I found the prices to be reasonable, especially for the large portions
We were seated at a table upstairs, which overlooked the first floor dining room
This is fine if you like to people watch, although having a bird's eye view of watching people eat isn't particularly appealing, nor very intimate
We started with a $16 crab cake appetizer--quite small and average tasting
For our entrees, the lamb was excellent--very flavorful and tender
The rib-eye sounded promising with the onion herb relish but it was less than tender and the relish didn't seem to do much to enhance the flavor
Side dishes were an additional $7--the au gratins were good but the asparagus tasted bland
In general, the service was good (the busboys were particularly attentive) but the food (with the exception of the lamb) was average, especially for the prices
Although the restaurant is beautiful, I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic dinner--it seems better suited for larger groups
My boyfriend and I went here for restaurant week on a Saturday night before a show
The pre-fixe menu allowed us a three course meal for $30, which is much lower than what you would normally pay at this place for a three course meal
Plus you had to pay for sides
A side of spinach cost $7 extra! The food was average and NOT WORTH the prices they charge
The soup appetizer was an interesting one
The Rib eye steak (which cost $4 additional) was charred on the outside and rubbery on the inside
My salmon was decent but drenched in oil
I could get that dish anywhere for a much cheaper price
The coffee cheesecake was pretty good to end things with but we left feeling pretty much disappointed
This place is not for the young crowd
Not for young people like us (around 30): we were 10 years below the average patron age
Although the restaurant wasn't nearly filled, we waited about half an hour to be seated, despite having a reservation

Went here for a nice, romantic dinner and had such a good time
So many wines to choose from which is always a plus
The tuna tartare is a MUST
The skate was perfectly done and there was just too much to choose from for dessert
I would definitely come back here!
I checked out Eleven Madison for the first time during this year's Restaurant Week
I found Eleven Madison Park to be an ideal destination for those who are in search of a romantic dinner
While most restaurants attempt to embarass you into asking for a RW Menu, Eleven Madison actually included their selections in their actual menu
The waiters treated us as if we were royalty and the cheeze puffs were out of this world
A most do if you are in New York city
Had the 5-course tasting menu
Everything was great
But it was the service that made the experience excellent!!! They were incredibly attentive, and we ended up getting many more than 5 courses
We couldn't even touch the last one
We were so full
We didn't want to leave
Get the chocolate souffle
It's wonderful! But if you get the tasting menu, you basically get to try all of the best of the entire menu
and more! Also, when making reservations, try to make sure you're not in the front two tables
It can get cold there!
Such a great place! The ambience is lovely
good for either a romantic or business dinner
I went here for my birthday
The food was exceptional
The service was top notch
A free dessert was proffered even though my birthday was not mentioned to the restaurant
apparently the waiter overheard someone in my party
I'm surprised there could be any negative comments about this place
I found it very appealing in every aspect
I enjoy dining at expensive restaurants as long as there is some value
By value, I mean that the food and service and ambience are excellent
The service was certainly fine, as was the ambience, but the dining was not
If you're considering a night out take a pass on this restaurant
There are dozens of great NYC restaurants
This is not one of them
We drove from Philly for our anniversary and had an absolutely perfect evening
The decor is stunning, the food excellent, and the service outstanding
The sommilier was very helpful and perfectly matched our courses with wines by the glass
I have a hard time imagining that the poor reviews were eating at the same restaurant as I
If you want a very special evening out then go to Eleven Madison Park, you won't be disappointed!
Went to Eleven Madison Park for restaurant week dinner
Room is impressive, but service is slow and taste was almost like fast food
Also portions were small
Some elements of dessert were quite nice, and the restaurant week special wines were a nice touch, but not enough to make up for the evening's negatives
Lots of hype and several dishes oversalted
Many other restaurants in the city are better value and much better taste
The food was excellent, the richness and flavor making the most of the portions
Impressive appetizers, entrees to perfection and desserts as impressive as they should be
The service was good, but not extraordinary, but meeting Kerry Heffernan more then made up for it
It was the first time in quite a while I have had a chef come out to solicit comments and the deed was most appreciated
The food was very good, the staff was very good, the ambience was very good
Not remarkable, but very good across the board
Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to go out for dinner in the area
My wife and I checked this place out for Restaurant Week
Expectations were pretty high considering the quality of Danny Meyer's other restaurants
Although it is no Union Square Cafe (but what is?), food was excellent, decor fine, service above average
I opted for the Restaurant Week menu, which was a good deal for $30
03
My wife opted for items off of their regular menu
My only complaint is that portions are pretty small
even for an haute cuisine type of restaurant such as this
However, it's not outrageously expensive, so I would almost opt for a Tapas-style approach to dining here the next time
Wait staff was surprisingly young, but we did go on a Mon
nite, so maybe it was training night
Complimentary petits fours were a nice touch
The hostess' were nice and accomodating
High ceilings and decor made the ambience
11 Mad's reputation for service is well-known so I expected excellence
I WAS disappointed
Our waiter didn't offer a wine list and questionned our cocktail order
Asking if we were sure it was a real beverage
We hardly saw him, altho' other busboys were attentive
I was taken aback when he came over to school me on how to eat my fish
Fine dining establishments usually attend to breadcrumbs left on the table
Not this time
I came back from the restroom, found my napkin folded but all the breadcrumbs were still on the table and more on my seat
Fortunately, the shining moment of the evening was when chef-Kerry Heffernan came out to greet diners
He was ABSOLUTELY charming and gracious
His food will make you come back
And yes, the SOUFFLET was sublime chocolatey heaven
Unfortunately, only 1 out of 4 of us ordered from the rest
wk pre-fixe
My friend tried skate for the 1st time loved it
They prepared the chocolate souffle for us which wasn't on the menu
The staff was great
We had a 3 yr old little w/us and they gave her crayons a pad of paper to play with
Our waitress, Amy was perfect, attentive but not obtrusive
Plus the chef, Kerry Heffernan was as nice as can be
I would definitely say the service was what made my experience so great
I've been here twice, my first time during Restaurant Week, and the foor and service that I received on these visits will definitely make me return
Normally during restaurant week, the upscale restaurants don't seem to go out of their way to treat their clientele very well
This was completely the opposite with 11 Madison
They gave us certificates to return, complementary chocolates for dessert, and they even overheard my friend wish me a happy birthday, so they put a candle in my dessert and wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate without her asking
The manager also came over to wish me a Happy Birthday and make sure our meals were satisfactory
The food was amazing as well
Even though it may be a bit pricy, the food and service is definitely worth going for
I visited Eleven Madison for the first time Saturday night
The service and the cuisine are unparelleled
As an idustry professional it is difficult to enjoy a dining experience but the service was attentive without being intrusive and the presentation of the dishes is beyond compare in that area
The onion consume and cote du beouf were phenominal You will leave understanding why Danny Meyer and his hand selected group of professionals have for years raised the culinary bar in every area of the city they enter

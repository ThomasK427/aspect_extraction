The prices are very cheap
This restaurant was recently rated in the top 100 NYC Cheap eats
The sevice was not the quickest, but you'd probably be too busy licking your fingers to notice
When I discovered El Malecon in Washington Heights, it became one of my favorite spots to eat and people watch
The food is flavorful and seasoned
Great value and quality
Authentic Dominican fare
It is not dingy by any means
It's a must try
Sat at counter, food took a while to come
Counter guy made me a black and white shake instead of giving me a glass with the metal cup he made it in, I saw him drink the rest out of the metal cup at the counter
Then he brought over two burnt hamburgers
But the Cook tried to hide the burnt part by heating up cheese and sticking a bun on the burnt side, so you'd need a chisel to get the bun off to see the burnt part
Cookie was also pretty slick too, he put another piece of fresh cheese on the other side to throw me and my wife off
It serves me right I'd been burnt there a time or two before, but never this bad
Stay away
sitting at the counter I met fellow denizions of th Heights; every race and age possible
Rock-on! Serve up eggs to the diversity of the area!  If you like diner food, you like this little greek place reminicent of Chicago diners
I just moved to this neighborhood 6 months ago, and I have taken all of my friends who come visit to Bleu
They have a really good brunch and dinner menu
I especially like the half size portion options
I have been here at least 6 times and have not been let down
I love the garden and the indoor decor
Although, their one mistake is a giant size TV in the bar area which is so out of place and was playing a horrible boxing match while my friends and I were having dinner
Terrible, terrible
What have the new owners done to a once wonderful place? Food is served cold and with attitude
This used to be the type of place you could meet up after work for a drink and perhaps a meal with friends
Now, it's simply an embarrassment to the neighborhood
Please close soon
They used to be great, but now they're billing themselves as some kind of Italian trattoria
Like we need another
If you used to go, and loved it like I did, I would think twice, or only visit if you happen to be in the neighborhood
I asked the waitresss what was up and she said they switched to Italian cuiisine, and they're making a slow switch back to what they use to serve
So who knows
Overall, not something you can count on
Basically- it was insulting
the waiter was obviously not caring at all about being kindly at all- just waiting on our tip
he was rude throughout, not even offering/asking if we wanted a glass of wine, something to drink, etc
The waiter explained the specials and seemed annoyed when my date asked about a specific item (on the specials)the waiter did not really know the answer did not offer to find out from the chef more
He then took our order - and as soon as we ordered he grabbed our menus quickly and ran away for a while
the food was okay- but not the biggest choices
The atmosphere is okay, eclectic
I would only go there if you have no other choices
he was very uninformative- and just annoyed seeming the whole time he had to deal with us
Went w/a few friends for dinner
Service was very good, but the ceasar salad was really bad
There was not work at all put into the ceasar salad
It didn't even look like a ceasar salad
It seems they just pulled out some lettuce, spinkled some croutons and sliced some cheese- AND THAT WAS IT!! The salmon was delicious, but it's all you get for an entree a slab of Salmon in some kind of tomato sauce and THAT'S IT!! The drinks were good for the price
Although the menu is very exciting serving Cocrodile as an appetizer, if you are a picky eater please stick to a McDonalds but if you want adventure this is the place to go
The Drinks on the other hand were the best , this girl knows her drinks
Enjoy
I live in the vicinity of Bleu and have, with only one exception, had a wonderful time every time I visit
Except for the one disappointment (even bartenders can have bad nights), the service has been pleasant, the food more than fair for the price and the attmosphere very relaxing
PS: Thanks for making New Year's Eve dinner so very memorable!
I was so excited to find such a wonderful dining spot so close to me
I went for brunch and it was the best brunch I have had in the city by far and I have been many places for brunch
The decor is wonderfully over the top
The waitstaff are very friendly
It was a pleasurable experience
within walking distance!
This little gem is a real find! The inside decor is opulent and beautiful, and the patio out back is great for al fresco summer dining
The food was uniformly good
The calamari appetizer and seafood marinara were standouts among a host of other tasty dishes, including steamed mussels and seafood ravioli
The french fries were excellent! Service on the slow side
Also, reasonably priced
Well done!
OK, the food's pretty good here, wouldn't say it blew me away, but it keeps me coming back pretty regularly
It's great to have Jesse's Place in the area
It's just nice to have a place like this - a sit down place with a lot of food choices, not centered on a particular ethnicity and a bar - as an option here
Brunch is great, sometimes with live music, can't wait until it's nice enough to sit outside
And it's a good lunch option, though I wouldn't call the vegetable wrap I ordered for lunch once exceptional (haven't come here for dinner yet
) We have heard live music coming from here on certain weekend nights
Went here for drinks one night and had great wine and appetizers
We live nearby and are happy that Jesse's is a couple blocks away!
We used to love visiting Jesse's because they had such excellent service staff
The staff made Jesse's what it was
They were efficient, friendly and would happily fix any problem you may have had
Since management made changes though, it is no longer the welcoming, familial, friendly atmosphere we had so enjoyed
Management had always been rude, but without the great staff as a buffer, Jesse's is just another pubby place with poor decor and average food
If it weren't for the fact the Washington Heights needs more gathering places, Jesse's would soon be empty
The previous guy is crazy, and, by the way, never take out your dislike for a restaurant's food on the waitstaff
In fact, if you are polite, they'll probably help you and get your order changed if you don't like what you got
Jesse's is a great place that offers a little something for everyone
It's a great neighborhood bar and restaurant that makes you feel at home if you are a nice person
The staff is extremely kid-friendly and the bar scene at nights is great when you want to leave the kids at home
I had pasta primavera with, get this, 4 carrot slices and 4 zucchini slices
That was it
Bland red sauce
Who puts red sauce on pasta primavera? When I paid I told the guy at the register that they should put some vegetables in, or change the name
He said, So you're not going to leave her a tip? I pointed it out to him on the table
He said, Oh
What a dork, giving attitude about crappy pasta
My roommate says she has had good food here at night, at the bar
Definitely have to agree with the more recent reviewer
I'm glad that I've found a place to eat within walking distance of my apartment that isn't centered around Dominican food
The staff is always friendly and attentive, and the candlelit table make for an intimate dining experience
However, there is a bar within the restaurant that has 2 TV screens showing sports on most evenings
The food is consistently delicious
Neither I nor my boyfriend have ever had a bad dish there

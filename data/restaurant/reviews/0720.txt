The night I made the reservation for was the first time I had seen it; I based it all on what I read on this site
The food was great
It had the traditional Cuban Sandwich, which was sooo good! There was this corn on the cob, that had cheese and some spices
DELICIOUS! I wasn't very fond of the entree that I had ordered, but my boyfriend loved it
It was a skirt steak simmered in onions, peppers and some sauce, but I dont really like my meat smothered in sauces; it was still good though
The service was great; from willingly changing our table for us
to consistently refilling our cups of water
:) The food wasn't overpriced, but the restaurant was small
Great for a first date, or to hang out with a small group of friends
I will definitely be there again
You could not have a better combination of food, service and ambiance
Giovanni is so accommodating! From the moment our hungry and rambuncious LARGE party entered and departed, all of us left very full and satisfied, and he and the attentive and thoughtful staff attended to all our questions and needs
I've done dinners of two and now ten and it is always a fantastic experience
I do not know what the negative reviewer is speaking of but she should definitely go back and give it another chance
Thank you Giovanni for taking care of us
We'll be back!
Great food, great service
And the garden area is lovely, with white curtains flowing the breeze - reminded me of Miami
VERY romantic! The place is kind of small, so I'd recommend making reservations
I wanted to have a small quiet dinner and decided to come here and enjoyed the food every much
Squid with garlic sauce
Again, Squid with garlic sauce
Had a great time
We sat in their garden area, and it was very nice
We didn't make a reservation and were seated within a few minutes
However, if I had a large group, I would make reservations
Maybe because it was Tuesday or just good timing
Good food, good times, will be back
This place made my wifes' birthday so special
All I did was tell the Manager, Mr
Giovanny Campos that it was my wifes' birthday and he treated us like V
I
P
Complimentary champagne for me and wife, we were treated like family, the manager as well as the waiting staff congratulated my wife on her 26th B-Day
All I can say about the food is one One word,,,DELICIOUS
God do you have to try their Paella!!! The setting is very romantic and if you ever been to the caribbean, then this place would remind you of it
To conclude to is a very classy place with delicious food
Thanks Havan for making my wifes' birthday dinner a memorable one

First, this place has the best sangria in the world
I don't even normally like sangria! The food is wonderful and fresh, the drinks are fruity and delicious, and the service is so pleasant
Cuban music added to the atmosphere
What a cool little place!
I cannot say enough great things about the service we have had at Havana this past Saturday night
Giovanny and his amazing staffs impeccable service from the start to finish made my boyfriends big 40 an unforgettable experience
I have worked in the service industry in the past and know how difficult it can be to please a big group of New Yorkers
Giovanny and his staff (our main server Renee, bartender Louis and all the other servers) were very attentive and extremely accommodating
When the ice cream cake I ordered didnt hold up in their regular freezers temperature, Giovanny immediately had a server run out and got an identical cake in 15 minutes
Everyone was blown away Of course not forgetting to mention the delicious food (esp
the Lechon), superb Sangria and beautiful yet relaxed tropical atmosphere
We were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there
Food was pretty good - I had the plantain encrusted red snapper
Service was almost too attentive, as if they wanted to turn the table over fast
If you want a less noisy atmosphere (they had live music), ask for a table in the back of the restaurant, which is completely separated from the front
Have eaten three times at Havana Alma de Cuba
Each time was fabulous
Staff and food are both excellent
Space is a little cramped
I wouldn't think it was good for groups
just take your significant other, and have a great time
Came for my boyfriend's birthday and had a great time
They have a nice relaxed and laid back atmosphere
Hostess as well as servers were very friendly and inviting
I loved the Mango Mojitos
They were awesome!!! The food was better than i had expected because i dont really like spanish food
I will be back for future visits because they have won me over!
We went with a group of 10 (already had reservations) and were seated immediately, even though our entire party was not there
The appetizers were excellent, especially the tamal
The pitchers of sangria and mojitos were also tasty and reasonably priced
I had the oxtail, which requires a little disection and was fattier than much oxtail on menus, but all in all was tasty
The paella was not recommended by those in our party, however
Chicken dishes seemed to be good
We rounded out the night with a flaming shot competition
The servers were not only friendly, but got the crowd into the fun of a latin atmosphere
Came for a friend's birthday, loved it! The food is inexpensive, good portions, Amazing staff
Had a reservation (which BTW we were late for) And weren't seated for about 15 minutes
Staff bent over backwards to apologize, Gave our party of 6 two chorizo apps (huge portions) 2 pitchers of excellent Sangria assorted cake platter, gratis
Nearly 100 bucks worth of food, Seat me late anytime!   Meals served w/flavorful sauces, Not a dessert person, but they were wonderful, esp
tres leches cake
Seafood's well prepared, had a seafood combination (don't remember the name) shrimp, scallops, codfish, mini-lobster tails squid w/rice, black beans mashed plantain-$16
95
Couldn't finish it all
Matre'D was warm, friendly ( cute,) Waiter Ivan, was fun entertaining, happy guy
Lively presentation for the birthday cake, for all the birthday people in the restaurant a hysterically funny shot drinking contest
Food, Ambience and Service was AMAZING
The only thing that needs a little help is the desserts
this little cuban restaurant has a lot of good variety of dishes to choose from
the sangria was excellent
the live cuban music was awesome
the place was crowded but the service was quick and very friendly
rsvp is a must
even tho some of the reviews said the desserts were bad, tres leches is a must to try, the equivalent of their sangria
la floridita and the pollo manigua were delicious
Just had a party here
Giovanny and his staff were amazing
There was no detail spared
Great service, great food, and a great time! I would definitely recommend this place for a party or a large group
It looked like a cozy date place too! Can't wait to come back
Giovanny, thank you
I just threw a 30th birthday party for my boyfriend and 15 of his friends

One server came and gave us food that turned out to be someone else's
THEN we waited for practically 40 minutes for the entrees
At no time did the waiter ever come over to apologize for the wait, nothing
The food, once it came, was mediocre at best
I will NEVER go back to this restaurant
The cheap prices don't make up for the lack of service
Good restaurant, bad bar
Before dinner, we had drinks at the adjacent bar and could barely hear each other
Once we were seated the atmosphere changed
Great dining room, which rivals any NYC downtown trendy spot, and fantastic food at non-NYC prices
Ecclectic menu and fabu drinks
We didn't even have to wait for a table for more than ten minutes on a Sat
night! Go, but don't tell too many people about this thai gem!
the owners did well when they opened this yummy place up
The bartenders are cool and the crab fritters rock!
Truth is, if I wanted this kind of attitude and expense, I'd just go to Manhattan
What used to be a nice neighborhood addition has turned into a too cool for school trendy bar
Restaurant may still be ok, but skip drinks at the bar
Truth be told, I generally only go in here to drink with my friends
The drinks are so yummy, Long Tan has become our neighborhood hang out, whcih is something we were lacking
It's really great to go in here and be able to get a creative cheap drink (they have things like blueberry mohitos for $4), a $4 plate of veggie spring rolls, and be able to joke with the bartender
Also, the decor is awesome and definitely caters to the many designers running around the neighborhood
Foodwise, I've only eaten here twice and found my meal to be super yummy both times
Waits can be fairly long some days though!
Long Tan is a wonderful addition to 5th Ave
Very sleek decor and bar--only a 10 minutes wait on a Saturday night for 4 people
All of the dishes we tried were tasty
We had drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert--our bill came to $120
Having just moved from Manhattan to Park Slope, a bill such as this one is a WELCOME sight
A little sticky (where's the AC?), but all in all, a very good night
Long Tan's mix of Thai Australian fusion adds the required element of cool for lower Park Slope residents
Quality food and a tasty selection of Australian wines at reasonable prices make this restaurant an ideal start point for a night out on the town
i ate here with 2 other friends on friday, 12/20
i usually like to view menus online to have an idea ahead of time, but there are only so many restaurants that list it
i chose this restaurant because it had such a good rating (9
8), but i really have no idea why
it's a relatively small restaurant, and the host took our orders
he had a very cold manner, and when we asked him again what the specials were, he seemed very annoyed
the waitress was probably new, because she had no idea what wine they had, or if they had a certain type by the glass or bottle, and kept going back to the bar to find out
the menu was simple and did not have much variety
i definitely will not go back here
the food wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great or impressive at all
We were looking for a reasonably priced french restaurant and saw Cafe Milou listed in City Search
First of all, when we arrived, we loved the decor of the place
The woman who greeted us was very friendly, the wait staff was great and we felt really well taken care of without being intruded upon
Everything was very reasonably priced and delicious
We sat at our table through drinks, wine, appetizer, dinner, dessert and coffee for a couple hours and never felt rushed
It was a great NY restaurant experience
I like this place---small, intimate and veyr charming
I love the decor, and the fireplace is very romantic
The food ain't half bad either!
Went to Opia for dinner with a friend after work
I didn't realize it was so loud during dinner
For some reason I thought there would be a separate dining room, but I was wrong
The service was good, nothing spectacular
The food was good, but like others have said, not worth the price
I couldn't have a conversation with my friend because it was way too loud
Probably good for drinks after work, not dinner
My boyfriend and I arrived at Opia at 6:30pm on a Sunday and were seated promptly because there was only one other party in the restaurant
The menu had a variety of items to chose from but with our luck, they were not serving sushi, which made up 1/3 of the menu
Of the things we ordered, we enjoyed the crab cakes and tomato and goat cheese pizza appetizers
Our meal of sausage penne and steak with fries were above average
The mojito and caipirinha drinks were good
The service is average
There is outdoor, balcony seating over looking the busy street corner
It was too cold the night we went but I can imagine how nice it would with warmer weather
The meal was not too expensive
If you're looking for a quiet place for dinner, Sundays should be a winner
I had dinner for two at Opia, and found the food to be excellent, and the ambience very nice
I'd recommend this for a small gathering, or for couples - probably not suitable for business or a group outing
The bar area looked very classy as well - worth a look!
I went here for dinner and drinks, the experience was AWFUL!! The food was overpriced and nothing special and the service was terrible! Our waitress Annie was so rude and obnoxious and I have had bad service before at many places and never complained but this was unexceptable
I will never return!
I had an awful experience here
One of the staff was extremely rude and unprofessional and when I asked for the manager he was of no help at all
I felt like he was just saying what I wanted to hear so I would just leave
I don't plan on returning and have already told me friends to stay away
The atmosphere is great! The food presentation is great and the staff is very attentive
However, the quality of the food is average, especially for the prices
I would recommend getting a table at the lounge area
I went to Opia on Friday night for restaurant week
The staff was very friendly
My dinner guest was running at least 30 minutes late and they even offered to seat me at my table if I wanted, something that I rarely find at other places
The choices for the pre-fixed menu were actually quite good
The apps were fantastic
I got the roasted chicken in a coconut curry sauce, and had to send it back because it was underdone
(And I never send anything back)
The second chicken that came was also undercooked, but I was enjoying the company so I just let it go
Dessert was ok
Nothing special
I would consider going back to give them a second try
I think it has potential
i was at opia january 5, 2006 we had some drinks, dinner, i have to say that we had me and my friend great time, the staff was listening, the manager knew what he was doing and the food better than ever!! we really had a blast we will be back soon
great for groups or just friend
the new chef is amazing
So many people still think that this spot is just a lounge, but the food is excellent, Opia deserve more credit, it is always a cool and reliable place to visit
When I arrived at Opia I wasn't expecting what I had, I've been always at the bar, having fun with my colleagues after work, and when I went for dinner I was really impress, in the other room where I never been but was very cozy, the wine was OK, even if teh server try to sell me another one, I insisted
The food I left it in his hands, and I never had a better tartar and not even talking about the dessert, out of this world!! It's a place to be for sweets, we had a tasting and was incredible!!!
The scene at Opia is set for a young, hip, yuppie crowd
They miss the mark by playing music that makes it too loud to hear from across the table

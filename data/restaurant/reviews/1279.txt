I tend to be very picky when it comes to Japanese food, so for me to say a place is pretty decent is a high compliment for a basic neighborhood spot
They deliver, too
If I lived in the Murray Hill area, I would get their delivery often b/c the price is pretty right
The bento box wasn't enough food for me, but it is a decent value at $17
It's also not exhorbitantly priced (Uni was $4
50, Toro also $4
50), so it's a good basic place
I cannot say enough good things about Maxie
Ambience is cool, modern and serene
Maxie is one of those places were you can go on a date and actually hear your date speak
It's also a good place to catch up with old friends without having to shout across the table
Japanese food is Inventive, really good and decent in portions
Presentation of food is excellent with knowledgable waitstaff explaining exactly what is in each dish
Some things to try: Nibblets: The Appetizer Sampler Appetizer: The calamari comes fried to perfection and is paired with an interesting green tea salt
I had the Bento box which is a good $17 value and will leave you full
The only compliant I have are the drinks
Not very inventive drinks for such an inventive menu
You have to try this
Maxie is such a welcome surprise
The food was AMAZING and the service was impeccable and extremely friendly
If you are looking for fresh sushi in Murray Hill then look no further
I had the tuna tar tar, tempura calamari, and the yuzuspiced tuna roll and it was OUTSTANDING
I have eaten at Nobu, Bond St
, Sushi Yasuda, Kuruma Zushi, Yama, etc
Needless to say I love not only sushi but Japanese restaurants
I heard this place was great and now I know it is
I origianlly did not want to post this review because I did not want to make this a popular place, but this place is too good not to share
Give Maxie a shot!!!!
The food is great (amazing non-greasy shrimp dumplings with yummy dipping sauce), the decor is fantastic (and surprisingly huge) and the service was impeccable
The rooftop deck is a quiet and woonderful oasis
Not to mention that the mango martini is so good you forget your getting drunk! I've lived in Murray Hill for years and in New York almost all my life and this is a budding superstar on all fronts
Maxie is almost wasted in a neighborhood that's known for meat-market bars serving mediocre food
If you are looking for great, downtown calibre japanese food in midtown, this is it
and very affordable
We'll be back defiitely
This was recommended to me so we tried it last night
Place is great looking, but have to say I've had better sushi elsewhere
I live in Murry Hill so I may try it again
But from the first experience, I'm not rushing to go back
You'd never think this restaurant is in Murray Hill
The ambience is great, and the sushi is superb! Not only is it delicious, but the presentation is utterly artful
It's a refreshing breath of downtown quality and taste to an area that desperately needed it! As for the affordability of this restaurant, that's just icing on the cake
We had eaten at Xing a couple years ago and had an above average standard big plate sharing Chinese meal
I remember decent service and a generally pleasant experience
This time when we decided to order some appetizers while we thought about our main courses our server told us if we did so we'd have to wait 40 minutes for the entrees
His explanation had something to do with the order tickets going in seperately and the chance of a big rush
I don't think more than ten people have ever eaten at Xing simultaneously but fine
He got our order wrong by giving us an appetizer we didn't order and not giving us one we did
We decided to share our four entrees as is common, hell, expected, at Chinese restaurants
Our server seem to think it would make sense to tell us that this Chinese restaurant serves single French restaurant style portions
Between that and a possible 40 minute wait on more orders we left hungry, angry and a little dizzy from the floor lights and general inanity of the place
The food tasted fine but the experience was very disappointing
I may be a petty man, but I hope this place closes soon
Had a reservation last night at 11:30
Ran very late and called to let them know
We got at Xing past midnight and told us they kept the kitchen open for my boyfriend and I
They are so friendly
Waiter recommeded great dishes that we ordered
The lamb was one of the best my boyfriend ever had
I loved the curried lo mein
The fried xo spicy rice was one of the best things I have ever eaten
Will be coming back whenever we are in the city
Xing is a great place
been there on a date, also with friends and even brought my parents
I am quickly becomming a regular
The interior is great and the menu is diverse
I love the duck rolls
They are basically a peking duck appetizer
Been there with picky eaters too and the chef was very accomadating
The service has always been top notch
I'm lucky that Xing is only a few blocks away
And they also deliver
Went to Xing last week and had one of the best dinners there
I read other reviews and the negative reviews are untrue
The restuarant is not expensive
The black cod I had was better than Nobu's
The ribs were juicy and tender with great flavors
We also ordered the lamb (which was amazing!) and crisy chicken was unique and another great dish
Try the thai beef salad as well
Love this place and the staff
And the check was a fraction of the cost of Nobu,66 or Kittichai  I highly recommend Xing, there is no other place like it in hell's kitchen (sadly)
The food here is great, and exquisitely prepared, but the portions are ridiculously tiny, to the point where it kinda makes you laugh when the three short ribs arrive at your table
I don't expect an enormous, heaping plate of food, but c'mon
Food was delicious, however
A poor value, though
I used to really look forward to dinner at Xing
Reasonable prices for good basic Chinese food with a visual twist
But come on, it's basic Chinese food
nothing spectacular
So when they raised their prices, you'd assume it's because they've gotten a new chef and the food warrants a price increase
Nope
Same old stuff you can order at the plethora of scuzzy Chinese places anywhere in the city
Xing has just priced itself into a class in which it doesn't compete
Based on the mixed reviews on this site, I wasn't sure what to expect
But, my friends and I loved the food and service
We had the pepper-seared sea scallops to start and shared the grilled sea scallops shrimp, ribs and black cod
The XO fried rice that accompanied the sea scallops shrimp was so good we ordered a separate side dish
Definitely recommend this place for excellent service and great food
Didn't try the cocktails, but they were innovative as well
I went there on a Tue night and it was pretty quiet

Churascarias are 5minutes ago, and S
American steak is in
LaPortena offers steaks that you can't always find at traditional steakhouses (flank, skirt, etc
), it's not just strips and porterhouses, plus they add some flair to the menu items
Rather simple in preparation, they let the meat do the tallking
The best part about this place is the prices are VERY reasonable
For the same as dinner at any chain steakhouse (outback, lonestar, etc
) you can get a MUCH better steak dinner
Sure, its not the Palm or Sparks, but its good, friendly and affordable
Looking forward to my next visit
The menu is wonderful, the food is of the highest quality, and the service is wonderful
Just a perfect little restaurant
The waits can be a pain however
A great dining expierence
Excellent food was cooked perfectly to order, served in a timely fashion, and best of all was delicious
The portions are huge, so bring your appetite
The prices are so reasonable i felt like i robbed the place
If you dont leave full, you need to go on a diet!
I adore La Portena
I ate there once and I was hooked
The steaks are deliciously juicy and have so much flavor, but not too much to overwhelm
They have great wine to accompany the meat and the mashed potatoes are light and fluffy
absolutely to die for!
A carnivores paradise where one can easily attain a ratio of 8 meats to 1 sitting
Save intellect for wine and opt for Argentine Antipasto: Matambre, hunger killer, a flank steak roulade with hard boiled egg and carrot, chimichurri soaked lengua, marinated eggplant and potato salad with peas
The chicken Guacho Pie is remarkably appealing
There's no point avoiding the Parrillada mixta, a metal trough laden with short ribs (grilled to juicy perfection), sweetbread, blood (unremarkable) and pork (slightly dry) sausages and skirt steak
La Portenas signature beef Milanese, is buried under sumptuous cream sauce
After sitting down with Don Pedro (vanilla ice cream with scotch and walnuts) finding even the mammoth E,V,F,R,G,7 station may prove difficult
Wrap up with Cachamai tea and youll find this wood and mirror clad joint has more to offer than the unsettling headshot of Donald Trump and posters of Carlos Gardelit offers meatglorious meat
La Portena is a very good, authentic Argentinean restaurant
The steak is not any more chewy than it should be, and is very tasty
my mouth waters just thinking about a good parrillada at Portena
If you want a better steak, a flight to Argentina is about $800
I was not dissapointed at all
The food was great and the service was attentive
Great steak! They have the best steak in New York
Their foods are all good
Their service could be a bit slow
Highly Recommended
The food at Ricky's is sometimes a little saltier than it should be, but their selections are decent, and their customer service is very friendly and they try to get to know their customers as most are locals
It may look like a diner, but the food at this local restaurant well surpasses its surroundings
Whatever you do, get something that includes the fabulous chorizo
it tastes like none other that I've had
The sangria is tops with just the right amount of fruit
And the skirt steak is the stuff made of dreams
who knew a skirt cut could be so succulent? Great staff, great owner
Nice and roomy for parties!
I was in the mood for some hearty Colombian cuisine
We ordered empanadas and a sample dish of picados for appetizers
The empanadas were crispy, nicely spiced and perfect to two to nibble on
The picadoa, however, came on a platter - like one suitable for the Thanksgiving turkey - and this was the SMALL dish
After grazing on the chorizo, potatoes, crispy pork and beef bits, we were rapidly getting stuffed
The rest went home for TV nibbles
We ordered the skirt steak and split it
Melt in your mouth tender and perfectly rare
The large pitcher of tasty sangria washed everything down - not too tart, not too sweet, filled with flavor and fruit
We rolled ourselves home, but not without two orders of flan
Outstanding
Looks like a diner, but tasted like a 4-star restaurant
Also, our waitress was the right amount of conscientious
I'm Colombian and I've been to many Colombian restaurant's in my lifetime
Though this is not the one restaurant I go to everytime I want my doze 'bandeja', it is my favorite and the one I enjoy the most
For first timers, I highly recommend 'La Bandeja'
It's huge
It has rice n beans (no surprise there), 2 eggs, sweet plantains, arepa (corn pie), pork and a choice of ground beef or (I recommend) steak
Among my other favorite dishes is the Skirt stake
One word, AWESOME
This restaurant is really pleasant and spacious, not to mention that the buffet and sit-down menu offers refreshingly authentic and amazing dishes
The Grill special was an amazing deal and more than plenty for 2! The prices are great and it's a nice place to go for a more upscale Indian dinner in Jackson Heights
The Vindaloo was out of this world! If your in to exotic Indian food this place is definitely worth a try
I've been to so many indian places all over the city and this is simply one of the best places
The food was wonderfully spicy and piquant, the flavors were bold and exactly what you would expect from Indian cuisine
Some of my friends go there weekly and rave about constantly! The portions are a bit large so you can share or go on an empty stomach
My regular Saturday place for over 8+ years! The buffet is to die for, especially when they have aloo gobi and paneer jalfazi
The murg chicken is almost always there, and the nan is the best I've had
The food at Delhi Palace is inconsistent
After five+ visits, we noticed that the service was generally very good
On our last visit, we noticed that the pappadum was greasy and soggy
while the chutneys were good
Food that we requested to be spicy wasn't, whereas the other choices were too spicy
Several dishes were excessively oily
This restaurant serves alcohol, which is a plus with Indian food
Overall the food was fair
When I first moved here, I tried all the restaurants along 74th St multiple times
This one became my favorite and has NEVER disapointed me
In fact, I go there once a week and when I have guests who like Indian, this is the spot I take them to
The selection is always great
They rotate their dishes every so often, so there is some variety depending on the time of day and day of the week, but my favorite dishes are always chicken chili, the cauliflower with potatoes, and the eggplant
The only thing I would complain about is their choice of Jello for dessert every so often (!?) All their other desserts are good
This place beats Jackson Diner hands down - everybody got on that bandwagon way too quickly and in my opinion, without merit
Indian Taj has the best buffet - food is always fresh and delicious
I have yet to have a bad dining experience there
Not to mention that the price and selection is unbeatable
Service is a little lacking - but you can get over that pretty quickly
If you are looking for inexpensive delicious Indian food - definitely give this place a try
Also, if the Palaak Paneer is not part of the buffet - order a small portion - it's worth it!
Okay, so we all know Jackson Heights has great Indian food, and that every restaurant has a really big buffet
I've been to several of them, including the better-known Jackson Diner
However, Indian Taj really stands out

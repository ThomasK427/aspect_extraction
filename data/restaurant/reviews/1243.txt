On the outside, looking in, Pukk looks pretty nice
A friend recommended this place to me so I thought I would check it out
It's a small place, I guess good for a small group of girlfriends or boyfriends to get together
The tile walls and the cushy/gelly seats looked pretty cool
The service is great
The music they played set the mood
I went with a good friend of mines and the overall experience was alright
I would not recommend the rice crepe appetizer
It was funky tasting, didn't know what was inside of it
And it was too sweet
The pad thai w/duck wasn't bad
The thai ice tea was probably the only thing I enjoyed there and in addition to the person I was with
This place isn't bad so long as you know what to order
we went before a movie so we needed fast service but it was a little too rushed, we were out of there in under 40 minutes
great value though and the food was delicious
vegetarian but it says chicken on the menu in place but they make it with some fake/tofu like substance, very good
my husband, who doesn't care for tofu, etc
really liked it
very cool interior, all white tiles like you are in an empty swimming pool or something, fun
My friend is vegan and she took me to this place about a week ago
I would go back just for the ambience! It such a funky cool looking place with white tiled walls and lime green seating
Im usually not such a big fan of vegan, but the food was good (esp the chocolate cake), and so were the apple martini's
Not for the claustrophobic tho
this place is small narrow!
Nice atmosphere, but the food was horrible
everything was too sweet, like a desert
my party ordered alot of appetitizers and we were horrified that each appetitizers tasted alike
sweet
i was expecting much more, but came out with an empty pocket and still hungry
Ended up at McDonnald
i would recommended this place for those that like only sweet items
this is your place!
Unsuspecting addition to this block
PuKK looks great from the outside (you won't be disappointed)
A friend and I went on a Friday night and were seated right away
The bright green ambience is a unique color
I had a Thai iced tea, traditional Thai salad (the peanut sauce is one of the best ever), the eggplant with basil (yummy), my friend had the pad thai with 'chicken' (very good)
Non-vegans will still be satisfied
The servings are small but just right for the price
The chocolate banana cake is rich, and apple turnover cake is sweet and delicious
All this for around $35 for two
Can't beat that!
I went here with 3 friends and we all enjoyed it
For the E
Village, it is quite inexpensive! The Watercress with Lotus Root appetizer was incredible, as was the Papaya Salad
Their soups are really delicious as well--one was a vermicelli soup, and the other was a spicy Thom Yum (I think)
In terms of main courses, the Pad Thai was dissapointing--not enough flavor
The Perfect Protein Duck was incredible, though
My boyfriend tried the Raad Na Hed--good, but nothing too exciting
Amazing decor, but it's a very tight space with not enough room for big winter coats or bags if you've just gone shopping
Check out the cool bathroom, too! Make sure to look for the hologram on the wall
A welcome if surprising addition to this block
Sleek modern decor warrants conversation
I eat meat and didn't miss it at all in my faux-chicken curry
Great apps and cheap to boot
Oh my goodness
I was sitting in my office facing the often dreaded decision of what to eat for lunch
So i just went to City Search and looked up restaurants by me
The first place i saw was Carl's Steaks and I am so glad it was
The food is excellent and it was delivered in under half an hour
I will be a repeat customer
The Scene Behind a modest storefront, a pleasant, green-tea colored room awaits downstairs
Japanese devotees crowd the long bar and the spill-over diners are relegated to a handful of tables
Kimono-clad servers add nice details like a choice of cups for sake
The Food Chef Hideo Kuribara, a three-time National Sushi Society gold medalist, presents superior fare
Delicate baby squid sashimi swims in a fruity, fiery mustard-miso sauce, green tea-infused tofu is a dense, creamy luxury
Tiny enoki mushrooms add a taste of the earth to sake-marinated scallops, which arrive in a table-top barbecue
Though it's easy to get carried away by the parade of dishes like almond-crusted shrimp tempura and baby eel ribbons served with spicy ponzu sauce, the sushi spread, featuring immaculate toro, sweet shiroebi and lemony tai, is the noteworthy highlight
If you want to enjoy authentic sushi, this is the place
Their omakase tasting course is amazing and perfect for those who are interested in trying a series of seafood appetizers
But you might be stuffed before you reach sushi that is served at the end of the course
The sushi here is amazing!!! The sushi/sashimi combination has the best mix I have ever witnessed - needle fish, uni, toro, giant clam - not your standard fare of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail
The restaurant is casual, but your tastebuds will be in heaven
This sushi chef became famous in Cliffside Park, NJ and moved up by getting to open his place in NYC
Hideo is awesome, english not great but what skill
He prepares the most authentic dishes, I guess that's why the bar is usually filled with Japanese
The sushi is the freshest and hand picked by Hideo
You will eat sushi like you have never before, price is well woth every bite
For a real treat, ask Hideo to feed you what ever he wants, what an experience
The sushi and sashimi here are excellent, and I have also had a number of very good to excellent cooked dishes
The quality of the fish is generally very high, the rice is exceptional, and the variety is mind-boggling
Even the most seasoned sushi eaters will find new and interesting items on this menu
The food here is on a level above all local competition (Blue Ribbon, Tomoe, Yama, Bond St
etc)
Unlike many of those places, all the money you spend here will go to quality food
There are also drawbacks to this restuarant: it is small, the decor is bland, and the waitress service is mediocre (most have some trouble with English)
The sushi chefs are friendly, and I recommend sitting at the bar
I higly recommend this authentic sushi restaurant to whom looking for traditional sushi
Fishes were very fresh, and especially sushi rice was awesome
Owner Sushi chef was friendly, and people who working there were very nice
I would say Ushi Wakamaru is one of the best sushi restaurant in NYC
Sushi was good (but NOT the best)
Waitresses were in kimono-styled uniform and look nice but they didn't seem to be good enough to work at this kind of expensive place
Waitress we had appered to be very impatient, didn't know the name of the fish in English, apptizer came when we were having entree and she made no apology
Our sushi didn't come at the same time, no wasabi on my friend's sushi plate
, Com'n, 2 of us paid almost $200
00 for our meals
It's NOT cheap
They should do things more properly and politely to provide a great dinner experience for their customers, right?? I had the way better service at very cheap Japanese places on St
Marks

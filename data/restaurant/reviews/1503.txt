My only mild complaint was the bloody mary glass could be bigger (small wine glass), but when it's being refilled that's a bit of a moot point  Well worth the $14
95 with or without the drinks
We'll be back for dinner for sure!
Finally a restaurant in Park Slope with excellent food, atmosphere, and customer service without Manhattan prices
Lobster and linguine are the best
great for small group parties
What a pleasant surprise it is to find a place like this in Brooklyn
Great atmosphere
Amazing food and good service
Manhattan resturant at Brooklny prices
One thing I will say is weekends are really busy so call for a reservation or go on a week night
I have been there afew times and will definitely go back
I have recommended it to some of my friends and havn't heard a complaint yet
Finally, in Park Slope
Brooklyn, a GREAT place to eat with an atmosphere to rival the best Manh type upscale restaurant, but with gourmet prepared meals at reasonable prices
Try to get a seat on the stepup level and appreciate the ambiance including the unusual open wood/brick burning pizza oven
Can't wait for my next visit

I just went there recently and i have to admit i was very impressed
The atmosphere is a cool city-like one
I tried the crab cakes for my appetizer, let me tell you , amazing! nothing short of that
My main dish was a Sea- bass Filet
It was nothing short of excellance
I couldn't complain about anything
My dinner there was great
I cant wait to bring my b/f there for brunch this sunday
I went to Black Pearl in Park Slope and had a great time
The restaurant itself is beautiful and sleek decor
The bartenders were freindly and the cocktails were fantastic! We came for a drink and stayed for dinner
I had the best Sea Bass i've ever tasted, seriously
I also loved the bellinni
If your in the slope, make this your new regular spot, I know I have!!
I have to admit, I was really looking forward to Black Pearl opening
It's right down the block from me, sports a great menu filled with classic italian fare, and personal pizzas that really melt in your mouth
My first night dining there was a great experience
The calimari is a must-try
The plush booths are comfortable, and the decor is a good combination of relaxing and romantic
But somehow, it's gone down-hill since day one, and now I need to know I'll have 2 hours to dine or I'll end up frustratred by the end of waiting and waiting and waiting for service and my meal
My two most recent experience of black pearl left the same sour taste in my mouth, which is unfortunate since neither had anything to do with the food
A few weeks ago, I went there for a romantic Saturday night dinner
We were seated immediately, and all seemed fine
But once we ordered our main courses, the waiting began
And we waited
And waited
For a while, it seemed they'd forgotten about us
Granted, Saturdays are crowded
You can certainly tell each dish is prepared with attention
After we finally got our food (great), we had to practically send up flares to get a check to finally leave
By the end of the meal, there were several people waiting to be seated and we wondered why they haven't found a balance between being courteous to leave diners time to talk, and turning over the tables
But the food is so good, I had to try again
This past Monday, I had a friend in town, and three of us met at Black Pearl to give it another go
Again, drink orders were rushed, meal orders delayed
The appetizer came quickly and it seemed the experience would work out well
But then minutes slowly ticked by before we got our meals, and our check was even farther behind
A good hour-plus was wasted just trying to get out of there
Unfortunate, but perhaps fixible
I'll give them another try, or maybe it's time to start ordering out for delivery
Just discovered this place through Citysearch
Had a great meal on Sunday
There were so many wonderful sounding things on the menu I had a hard time deciding, went with the specialty, seafood risotto, and was extremely pleased with it
Very reasonable prices
Great service and ambiance
The noice level was a bit high, since sounds seem to really bounce around in there, but overall a highly recommended restaurant
also found on city search and was extremely suprised! the food and the service and the drinks were all great!! will def
be back!!
I found this restaurant on Citysearch and am sooo happy! The food was great, service perfect-really nice waiter, and the vibe was cool
I will be back
This place is a must try
The atomosphere is cool and the decor is sexy!  They have a great happy hour and the food is delish
Stop by when you get a chance!
great! truly enjoyed the food and the service
i recommend this spot for a great dining experience
Chipotles are usually great anyway, since you get to choose your meat and your fixings, and the portion is large
Too large for my taste, however, but I'm sure for everyone else it's great! 1 burrito will equal about 2 big macs and fries! it must weight about 5 lbs
It can get slow at times, but it is worth the wait
However, expect to pay $10-12 for a burrito and drink, pretty steep for a fast food chain
Don't get the tacos
You have to get the gigantic burrito
This newly opened restaurant is another one of those Indian places that has a hugely promising menu and a greatly disappointing food
The food which is OK actually seems much worse because of the lost potential
Desperately trying to be the kind of chat houses you would find in Delhi or Mumbai, this place has everything on the menu: pani puri, sev puri, samosa chat, kachori chat, pav bhaji, vada pav, usal pav and so on
However, everything tastes more or less the same with way too much sweet chutney
The pav bhaji is actually quite good
The service is good and quick
The decor is as tacky as you can possibly image
Probably because it has just opened you can use the bathroom without getting grossed out
They play very loud music from the 70s, a mix of Hindi and English that can prevent you from thinking let alone having a conversation
Still recommended for vegetarians who must have some of the items on the menu and don't care to be particular about it
I took my girlfriend to dinner last weekend at Sukhadia's, she's a vegetarian and I am not
I was sceptical
She thought the food was delicious and surprisingly I was in total agreement
I can't even try to explain the complexity of flavors and spices that made this dining experience so delightful for me
The service was friendly and the dining room was very romantic
Also, the desserts (which I believe they are famous for) were so delicious they might become an addiction
If you're going out for Indian food look no further than this great midtown spot!
This place is exceptional
Having experienced the increasingly rude and really nothing special Holy Basil down the road we just wanted good Thai food and this is perfect
Inside their slick all white candlelit room the menu is varied
Fish cakes are authentic, curries are superb, noodles are tasty you can even get real Thai sticky rice! Dont let the healthy slant put you off, its all good! With a small but decent wine and beer list, speciality drinks and a sake menu you really dont need anything else
We dont visit as often as we would like but even so they always remember us oh and did I mention it is a bargain too! Recommended Massamum curry, Duck Tamarind and Chicken Satay salad

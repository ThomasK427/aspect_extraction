Definitely a bit pricey, but it was worth it!
My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day and we had a great time
Although it was crowded, the tables for two were spaced well enough to provide an intimate setting-candles and all! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and was always around to refill our wine glasses
The restaurant even had a live jazz band playing (I think this was a special for Valentine's Day)
Although it was definetely pricey, the excellent food, service, and atmosphere combine to give this cute restaurant an A+
I went Brasserie Julien for brunch with a group of five and had an awful experience
We waited for our waiter for 15 minutes, and then waited for our food for over an hour
After sitting at the table with empty glasses for a 1/2 hour, we had to ask the busboys to get us drinks as our waiter was nowhere to be found
The food was fine -- nothing incredible but not bad either -- but the service was so bad that it was hard to enjoy the meal
The table next to us actually walked out
The waitress was not very apologetic, it was like she knew she blew her tip so she didn't bother to ty to make it up to us
I see other reviews dating back 2 years ago complaining about the same sort of situations which makes me think this was not a fluke
went for dinner with two friends and all of us were raving about our meals--the best steak i've had in a long time, and the duck and salmon were also delicious
the steak portion was very generous and it came with a beautiful salad and tasty fries
the place was a little empty but by the time we left around 9:30, the place was hopping
the atmosphere is superb and the staff was helpful and not the least bit pretentious
can't wait to go back!
The first time we visited Brasserie Julien, we took my mother and our 15-yr old nephew
We chose the restaurant primarily based on proximity to the Metropolitan and because they had live music on Saturday night
We were so happy with the choice - the nephew loved the music and we all loved the food
Cecilia was especially welcoming and fun!  I had such a great meal that I talked my boss into walking 40 blocks to go back when we were in the city on business
He raved too!
This place is not the top French bistro in town
HOWEVER, I kept going back because of the effort and the sincerity of the staff, and the improvement they made for the past years
Food is pretty good, drinks are awesome
Peak hours service is kinda shaky at times, but definitely improving
I really like hanging out there on Sunday afternoon, for a relaxing brunch / drink
It's nothing like this on UES
It's not pretentious, it's not park ave attitude
If you're a foodie, you'd appreciate
For a seen it, done it all New Yorker, BJ's blows me away
I love, love, love everything about it
The decor, ambiance, food, unpretense, service
Everything about his bistro is above my NY expectations
I was very surprised to learn that there was an excellent brasserie on the Upper East Side
I thought I would have to go to Chelsea or better yet, Paris, to find such a warm and loving place to dine
I started out with homemade country pate with cornichons, grilled sourdough bread and mixed greens with Julien's dressing then went on to the homemade fettuccine tossed with fresh vegetables in a red pepper pesto for a main course
For desset, I had Cecilia's Chocolate Marquise served with vanilla sauce and crushed pistachios
Unbelieveable! It was sumptuous
We went there for Valentine
Mediocre food, unfriendly hostess/owner, terrible service, way overpriced
Waste of time and money
I am never coming back
I recently stopped into this inviting restaurant, trying to get out of the cold
What greeted me was a wonderful selection of french dishes, and the chef's concoctions that will bring me back again
The waitstaff were very friendly and offered suggestions from wine and beer selections to their favorites off the menu
To the reviewer that had a bad experience here, i can only say that it helps to speak up if you are unhappy
That you sat in a cold spot throughout the dinner, is your own fault for not asking to move
Go back again and see how good this place really is
We stopped by this place after seeing a movie on a sunday for some wine and dinner
We were greeted by a very angry looking waitress who sat us right in front of the door in freezing weather even tho the place was pretty umuch empty
Our onion soups were flavorless and colorless
onions in it were barely cooked and crunchy
My friends medium rare steak was well done and fries tasted and looked like they were bad fast food restaurant
My endive salad was so incredibly bad i couldn't have ore than a bite endives were so rotten they were turning brown
And on top of everything we paid a $45 a person
Absolutely the worst retaurant I've been in years
Found this little gem of a restuarant, and will be back again soon
The decor and lighting match the superb cuisine, that kept my dinner guests and I in a lingering mood, not wanting to leave
The Oyster soup and Rock Shrimp with risotto, were favorites, along with a sinful BonBon of decadent chocolate for dessert
So many options that looked tantalizing on the menu
Having been promptly seated and served two delicous courses (not by our waiter) we were left waterless and drinkless for an hour by our invisible waiter (he disappeared after taking our order)
Despite our pleas to bus boys and other waiters to have a second glass of water and more drinks none were forthcoming until I was signing the creditcard receipt
Memorable food and ambience were runined by inept service
Ive been dining here about once a month for over a year - terrific every time! The menu is always pleasing as it goes through its seasonal specialties - its often difficult to not over order, given the varied, yummy offerings
From the delicious food to the friendly bartenders to the gracious owner, this place is the ideal home away from home (as if your home might be so elegantly appointed with fine food, wine, and dcor!)
Ambience is perfect for quiet conversation, so much so that we sometimes dont leave the comfy bar chairs for the comfort of the inviting dining room and knowledgeable, friendly wait staff
The wine on tap is terrific, pairing beautifully with the food
A bonus - the occasional e-mail bulletins from the owners about special goings-on at BJ! No attitude, no scene


I almost want to keep this one to myself
My husband and I were exploring where to eat on one Friday evening, and we couldn't help but come back to this place because of it's unique ambiance and yummy-sounding menu
Very good and attentive service, delicious specials, live jazz music, and a dessert menu I'd come back for
Not stuffy or too expensive
Enjoy!
What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! My wife and I try to have dinner here at least once a month
The food is consistantly well prepared and presented
The wine selection is fine
It is a good place to be romantic and enjoy each other's company
Great food and atmosphere, this place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood
And check out the decor, it's all Art Deco cool!
I started coming here a few months ago when I happened to walk past Brasserie Julien's offering of Tuesday night's happy hour
Free fondue and sponsored drink specials were all my girlfriends and I needed after a tough day on the job
Since then, we've been back for more on the other nights for various dates, b-day gatherings and simply for some fantastic french cuisine at reasonable prices
Why schlep downtown when we can chill in such a fantastic ambience a stone's throw away from home
Boasting some of the most fatuous and narcissistic barkeeps in New York, BJ is nonetheless a fun place to spend some time
The bar is pleasant, the drinks are well-made, and the food is actually quite good, including all the classic bistro staples
The fondue, in particular, is a wonderful winter treatbut it has to be shared or else you'll wind up having a coronary and then one of those clichd Frenchmen would bungle the CPR
(Sorry about the title; Citysearch asked for it!)  My wife and I live in the neighborhood and, along with another couple, have been making the rounds
This place has quickly become one of our favorites
The menu is extremely interesting and deep, and it changes seasonally
The food is excellent, the service first-rate, and the ambiance lovely
The only thing I can't comment on is the dessert, because none of us ever has any room!
The ambience in Brasserie Julien is nothing short of transcendent
fusing the deep crimson and velvet aesthetic of Paris to the heart of the Upper East Side
The drinks are made to perfection
Be prepared to conduct yourself as one who is familiar with the ways of the world
This is not the bar for lackeys of posers
An unpretentious sexy atmosphere lends itself to the above average wine-list and a menu that can stand-up to any other restaurant in NewYork City (or Paris)

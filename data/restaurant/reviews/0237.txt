the waitstaff works like a well oiled machine (except for the unecessary snobby hosts/hostesses)
The food is to die for and you are not going to go broke eating there
This is why Tao is obviously one of New Yorks best restaurants
Ate here last night with a 7pm reservation, met my friend for a pre-dinner drink at 6
30 discovered they could've seated us immediately
We preferred 7 so returned 20 mins later and was seated around 7
10
This place was packed for a Wednesday night, we shared the Tempura Shrimp appetizer then I had the Sea Bass main and my friend had the Filet Mignon with onion rings - all dishes were cooked perfectly with more than sufficient portions
The food was not over flavorful which I liked, it was tasty, juicy fresh
For dessert we had the large fortune cookie which was okay but not exceptional in my mind
The place is fairly loud but we didn't have any problem hearing each other and the ambience was great
Service was excellent which rounded off the perfect dinner experience
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple
We were seated within 20 minutes from the time of our reservation
This restaurant is very noisy and we could barely hear each other talking across the table
The food, however, was very good, specifically the sea bass-probably the best piece of fish I've had in a long time
Beware though, it's very pricey
You can't leave here with a group without spending $70 a piece
Most of the people at Tao seemed to be enjoying themselves, but I hated it
If you're able to get past the cattle call coat check and the free for all host stand, you'll be greeted by hordes of tourists ogling the cliche cocktail list as if they'd never seen a martini before
The generic pan-Asian fare is priced to gouge unsuspecting tourists
The service was mediocre but it was not nearly as offensive as the wondering saxophonist and the disgusting decor
Despite posts about long waits, ours wasn't bad
Got there at 6:15, were seated by 6:40
One downside is that we were seated in the back corner near the restrooms which left us a poor view of the giant Buddha
Nevertheless, the food was delicious
The satay chilean seabass and tuna sashimi rolls appetizers were spectacular
I do not like sushi and this is the first time I have ever liked it
For entrees, I had the Wok Seared Sirloin, which was good, and I was impressed with the portion size as compared to standard upscale restaurants
She had the spicy tuna roll and the salmon, crab, avocado roll
She liked both, but felt they were small
For dessert, we shared the Fuji Apple spring rolls, which was also good
Overall, I definitely enjoyed Tao and would go back, if my wallet would allow me to do so more often!
I'm an idiot
Why'd I order the $88 Kobe beef steak? Because I figured it had to be amazing
It wasn't
Wholly mediocre
Very disappointed
We shared various apps, all good - the sea bass satay was lovely, the ribs, the shrimp - all yum
My wife loved her lobster
But the Kobe is all hype, it seems, and that's the last time I shell out that kind of cash on a steak
Shame on me!
Wow, when I booked Tao the previous week, we were given two options only: 6:15 and 10:00
We chose the latter, expecting a half-dead restarant on a Monday night
Were we wrong? The place was kickin'! We arrived and got a drink at the bar
The age group was strictly 18-45! We were seated by 10:25
The place was packed, and the decor and large buddha looked great
The place is huge, with a large space upstairs too
I ordered a mid-size sushi platter and kept me happy
No room for dessert! If you're looking for a fun, lively place full of too-cool people, then this is it
Unfortunately, we were quite tired and the whole noise level and energy of the place seemed a little overbearing for us
I'd recommend the place most for groups of friends
Generally I'm not one to hit the hottest or trendiest places in town, but I was invited here for a friend's birthday and looked forward to it weeks before I went
All of my expectations were beyond met
Great food, wonderful staff, and an ambiance that is beyond compare
Yes it's very pricey, but you should know that before you go in, so it shouldn't bother or shock you when the check comes
Premium costs for a premium place
I took my BF there for his B-day
I was never a real fan of the food, but I wanted him to experience the ambiance and see what works in terms of drawing ppl to a restaurant
After last night, it seems like people don't expect much when it comes to good food as long as there's loud music and pretty ppl
We had a 9:45pm reservation on a Wed in Dec
, but was not seated until 10:30
We ordered the chilean sea bass appetizer (overcooked and salty), yellowtail in ponzu sauce and Tao Angry dragon roll, nothing special
For the main course, he ordered the Hong Kong XO shrimp, nothing more than shrimp with brown sauce and I ordered the yellowfin tuna, which was tasteless
Most expensive, overpriced chinese food I've ever had
Will never return and I DON'T recommend it for dinner
We couldn't get reservations for a Saturday night, so we waited at the sushi bar
We got a seat after 1/2 hour of waiting at 8:30 on a Saturday night, and the food was amazing
The yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno and ponzu was fantastic
The people who work there are fine, but some of the other patrons were horrible snobs
The Budda seems to be the most beautiful attraction at this restaurant, along with the beautiful girls and guys
Having reservations does not help on the weekend
We waited almost 3hrs for a table
The food was alright
Decor is attractive
Go for pre-fixe lunch
Went here for the first time tonight and was so pleased! We sat at the sushi bar upstairs, which granted, was a tad out of the way, but better than sitting in the lounge downstairs
I had sushi (which I watched the chef prepare) and it was fantastic! For 2 people it cost 100$ w/ tax tip, but fully worth every cent! 6 hours later I am still blissfully full :)
It really depends what you get here
Their vegetable dumplings are some of the greatest I have had and I wanted to drink the sauce that came with them long after I had inhaled the dumplings
However, not all things here are great
This place is always crowded
You will wait for a table, wait for your drinks and wait for your food
The decor is gorgeous
My husband and I recently had one of our worst dining experiences at Tao
The food couldn't be more mediocre (you can get much better food elsewhere for a fraction of the price)
The service was ridiculously bad - after we told the waiter what we would like to drink, he asked: what would you like to drink?
We ordered 3 dishes for entrees and repeated them to him twice, and he managed to forget 1 of them anyway
The staff was very good at ignoring customers and no one cares how you feel about the food or they were probably afraid to ask since the food was so awful
The chicken Pad Thai tasted like the chef dumped a jar of sugar and a bottle of vinegar in some sticky old noodles
Ugh!!!! Couldn't wait to leave
This place is definitely not recommended
The dcor is kitschy and the noise level high
Overall I believe that this restaurant had potential, because dining out is as much about the experience as it is about the food
Speaking of which, I felt that the many of the entrees I ordered were over laden with herbs and spices
The chef would benefit from a more subtle approach to flavor
When food is overdone in this manner I cannot help but wonder what mistakes the kitchen is trying to cover up
Tao was deemed to be creative and innovative when it first opened
Not anymore
Since then, NYC has seen numerous Asian and Asian-influenced restaurants, some of which are very good

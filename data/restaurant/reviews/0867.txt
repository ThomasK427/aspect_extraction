The server asked if we intended to share the appetizers
After observing what happened to our left, we answered with an emphatic NO
She then suggested the Saturday special (chicken) instead of the hangar steak, but I declined
She asked, Are you sure you don't want to try the special? It's fresh and really popular tonight
I declined again
She left and returned with the hostess (the chef's wife), who asked me if I would like to try the special
She then asked me, Are you sure you want the hangar steak? Have you had it before? I said no for the third time
Many people aren't familar with the cut and are disappointed by the texture
The server returned again to tell me that they were out of the hangar steak
She told me that I should have heeded the many hints she dropped about the hangar steak including her attempts to steer me towards the special
I asked why the run-around? Why didn't she just tell me they were out of the hangar steak? She said it would be unprofessional
UNPROFESSIONAL?!?! Arghh! I was so annoyed that I didn't order an entree at all
I decided that their furtive antics would cause them to lose out on my $25 entree
I stuck with my mediocre salad frisee instead
I wish I could say that there was something redeeming about this experience, but there was not one
Service was beyond horrible and the food is mediocre at best and plated in unappetizing ways
I will not go back
The Lighthorse Tavern is a little on the pricy side for lunch (15$-25$) but was worth the extra 5$
Ther service was good and the food was excelent
Nothing fancy, but a step up from the average sandwich place
The best part of the meal were the french fries
They are awsome
So if you feel like spending the extra money, then the lighthorse is an excelent lunch choice
In Short With its dark wood details, celebrity photos and tuxedo-clad waiters, this upscale steakhouse chain has the air of a posh men's club
Service is professional and discreet, with bartenders making a mean martini
Dinners begin with a waiter-driven cart laden with fresh vegetables, live lobster and cuts of steak; customers choose from porterhouse, rib-eye, bone-in prime rib and more
Side dishes are traditional and enormous, from baked potatoes and creamed spinach to steamed broccoli with hollandaise
The chocolate souffle is yummy and so is the filet mignon
Make reservations if you can
Its not the most romantic restaurant but it could work for anniversary dates and such
Although reservations were made a month ago, we still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated
What's the point? People who just showed up without reservations were seated before us
We did not receive the table requested and were seated at a table that was too small for our party
Service was extremely slow and incompetent
Almost 4 hours had passed from the time of our reservation to the time we left
Some medium steaks were completely burnt and some were undercooked
We were told that this is the way they prepared their steaks
If that's the case, then I will have my steaks prepared by someone else
Have been here several times since they opened, both with and without reservations, and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food
The wine selections are above average and the steaks are excellent
Try to save some room for dessert, especially the Godiva chocolate cake! The prices may be steep for some, but
Having owned my own restaurant for over 8 years I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to the service staff as I know first hand what hard work they do
However, that being said we received by far the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant
The food was good but the staff left much to be desired
For the first time in my life I will go out of my way to tell people what a bad experience we had at Azalea
There are so many excellent restaurants in New York that giving this one a second chance makes no sense at all
It's always refreshing to find a nice place with a staff that truly give you that feeling of personal touch
The food is out of this world!!! I love Italian food, and the Northern Italian dishes here are perfect
I would recomend Azaleas to anyone who is looking for a wonderful pre or post Theatre experience
I had the Veal and my girlfriend had the Salmon
both excelent
I hear great things about their signature salad served in a parmesian bowl, but I'll save that for another review
Also, the dessert menu is VERY tastey
Enjoy!
Azalea is a fantastic unknown of the theatre district
The food, decor, wine lists, and location are top notch
The wait staff is always helpful and willing to suggest new items wines to go along iwth your meal
I think the menu has great variety and you can probably try something new each time you visit
The appetizers are delish- Spicy calamari, pear souffle with gorgonzola are popular with my friends
The penne azalea, parpadelle with wild boar and fettucini bolognese are delicious selections from the pasta menu
For those looking for great fish, they have an excellent red snapper with mussels and clams too
I really would like to find out who owns this restaurant, or, at least who manages it
It is such a waste, because the place has huge potential
It is nicely decored, you walk in, you fell like you're walking on 5 stars
But,as soon as you're seated, reallity sinks in I gues, because the waiters are -sorry to say-simply THAT BAD!They have absolutely NO CLUE about the basics of service, it is such a waste, because the food isn't bad at all,you can see that the chef is probably a very creativeartist, but it all gets lost on the bad service
If you're in the area, my best advice is
try someplace else
We wound up here after making the mistake of not having a dinner reservation on a Friday night before seeing a show
I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of tourists and the attentive service
Great wine selection
I'm not a big Italian fan, but had a great experience here
Honestly, I think this tiny place has the best sushi I've ever had
It is always fresh, the owners are incredibly accomodating and the spicy monkey roll is the best thing since sliced bread
You do not have to spend $300 per person to dine on the best sushi
I truly hope they open other restaurants
Their Ocean Roll is amazing as well
Their rolls are nothing like you've seen and the presentation is really beautiful
I have been frequenting Iron Chef for about a year now
Every single time has been absolutely phenomenal
The sushi is amazing
The service is extraordinarily quick and extraordinarily friendly
It is a great place for a date
It is a great place for a casual dinner too
My only critique is that the tables aren't spaced very far apart so it feels like you are eating with the couple next to you at times, but the restaurant is very small and always busy, so they have to do what they have to do
do NOT let that stop you from giving it a try
A+
I have been to many expensive sushi places in NYC, but this place beats them all in every category: Quality, Service and Price
I absolutely adore the salmon miso soup, it alone is enough to fill you up and it really hits the spot on a cold night
The house rolls are excellent, you can't go wrong no matter which you choose! The hardest part is deciding what to get because everyting is soo good!The portions here are bigger than anywhere I've seen and the prices are beyond reasonable
This place is very small and it packs up quick, your best bet is to go late and miss the dinner crowd
This is a primo first date spot!!!!
Great variety of apps and specials every time we've been - in addition to a wide variety of sushi/sashimi
The staff is super nice and the space is cozy, if a bit small
They choose their fish carefully here
The sushi is incredibly fresh, the rolls are creative and tasty, the service is fantastic (so personable and sweet) and it's very well priced
Everytime we have out of town guests and a chill night where we want to stay in Brooklyn, we bring them here
We also come all the time and order out
Huge fans!
Maybe the best in the city--really
The sushi is extremely fresh

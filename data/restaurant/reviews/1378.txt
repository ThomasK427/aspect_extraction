The space: Yes, there is lots of it
Too much IMHO
Too many corners and nooks in which to get buried
Went Sunday to avoid crowd, didn't like being shunted to the bar to order drinks when the table was obviously ready (that's a $ gimmick)
The menu is probably too long, and a bit overpriced but not that much--this is upscaled in terms of ingredients and flavor
Everything we had was very good--the edamame dumplings are like eating silken cream cheese
Deviled tuna tartare was fresh if not inspiring
Chili crab was a huge serving, tasty but simple
The lamb chops were perfectly cooked, delicious but served tepid and needed another element but came out 10 min after other entrees
Apology given but no comp of any sort offered
Would go back and stick with smaller plates
Wine list is fairly priced and long as well
So I went there with a girlfriend of mine after hearing how great the food was at Buddakan
What a disappointment! Everything we had was mediocre at best and we even had to send back our crab shui mei b/c it was terrible-full of salt and just tasted weird
The table next to us had the same problem and ended up sending back multiple dishes
After only ordering a few apps we decided not even to order an entree! If you want to go there only go for drinks and the atmosphere b/c the food is definitly not worth it!!!
Had an amazing dinner here
Highly recommend the edamame dumplings and the shrimp entree (the sauce is heavenly
) Our waiter was helpful, courteous and attentive
The decor is minimalist yet warm
I would have expected sub-par service and food at a place like this but was pleasantly surprised that it was all that it turned out to be
Whenever I enter a place like Buddakan, I always expect the same ol' crap: cocky waiters, scene-driven, lousy food, long waits and an outrageous bill
Buddakan just blew me away
The service was extraordinary, the food was sublime, the prices were right where they should be, and the place, despite being a bit loud, made the dinner experience come full circle
It is remarkable that a restaurant this big run such a tight ship
In other words, Buddakan is a cut above
Highly recommended
My girlfriends and I went in last night, and being that one of us has a husband who is an editor for the Times, we had heard many good things
Regretfully, our first impression wasn't that great
We were placed at a table which we did not want/like due to its high-traffic area
A server, Bill, approached saying that we had the best table in the house because it was in his section! Boy was he correct
Quite possibly the best service I have ever encountered, he made our evening a smash
The food was outstanding as promised, the decor became even more enchanting as the sun went down behind us, and heck I even liked the bathrooms here! We will definitely go again, this time with the hubbies, and if you go do yourselves a favor and see if Bill and his best table in the house are available!
I will never eat at this place again
It was some of the worst food that I've ever had
The service was good but they odviously spent all their money on the look of the place and not the taste of the food
Peter Elliot of Bloomberg News called Buddakan a Wonderland
It IS a big, gorgeous space
One reviewer mentions Buddakan is another tao - it's so funny what people (who know nothing about restaurants) write
Mark Packer and Rich Wolf copied Stephen Starr's original Buddakan
People, please write about what you know
Stephen Starr is brilliant, a man with vision and drive
the staff IS nice, hospitable and unassuming - that's how they are hired and trained
The food is amazing at this restaurant
Has anyone tried the duck? the lobster dumplings? edamame dumplings? The food is filling, delicious and very reasonably priced
If you want $5 chinese food go to Chinatown
Everyone, who knows anything, knows that when you pay - you pay for ambience, the food and the service
I promise this restaurant is so fairly priced
Everyone is talking about Buddakan, everyone
If you want a memorable night out, go
Arrived for reservation on Saturday night and waited at the packed bar area to be seated
When we went down below this ginormous space to our table it felt like we were in a large vault
Although the space is extremely large, it's not very inviting and feels a bit too large - none of the grandeur of a large space like Matsuri
The tuna spring roll, sea bass appetizer, black cod, spinach side and shrimp dish were all melt in your mouth delicious - one of the best meals I've had in weeks
Friends had poor experiences here with pasta dishes so I recommend you stick with the seafood
Service was wonderful and very helpful
Aside from the large space, only downside is the bathrooms - they're extremely dark and there's only one small mirror in the ladies room - girls, consider yourself warned
I met up with some friends here last night and had a great experience
The place is beautiful -- it could be a scene, but thankfully it's not, because there was absolutely NO snootiness from the staff
We couldn't get a reservation for dinner, so we had planned to just meet here for drinks in the cocktail lounge area
However, we were able to make a great meal off of the appetizer menu and wound up staying for hours
The server we had was so accommodating -- she was really knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations and never made us feel rushed
Alos, the place was also filled with people, but it's big enough so that it didn't feel crowded
I definitely recommend it
All these positive reviews of Buddakan here suggest Mr
Starr has his minions at work
This is yet another in a long line of fancy rip off joints that sucker in New Yorkers by the dozen with seemingly cheap ethnic food a la Tao Morimoto
Well, the food is mediocre, the server we had was clueless and a couple of the drinks undrinkable
We told the manager when the waitress didn't care
How funny to read it is flawless elsewhere on this board
I went with a group of friends this past weekend, and loved it
The door staff was wonderful and so organized (not snooty at all
) The atmosphere blows you away the second you walk in the door ask to sit downstairs
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly and the food was out of this world - with every bite you cant believe how good it is
The problem is that our waiter told us that they served everything family style and that for our group of 9 we should order 6 apps and 6 entrees
We over-ordered and got 8 and 8, and it still wasnt enough
When I hear family style I think of big bowls of stuff ala traditional Chinese restaurants
These were more like Chinese tapas
Also the drinks are very $$$
But we had a fantastic time and I would definitely go back
From the moment we walked in the door we felt like VIP guests
We accepted the offer to have a drink in the lounge before being seated and the cocktails were unique and delicious
We were seated at a cozy table in the library and received prompt, impeccable service from a very knowledgable server
She guided us through both the food and wine menus and we were incredibly pleased with her recommendations
everything was stunning
From the appetizers through dessert we enjoyed one-of-a-kind dishes that were as pleasing to the palate as they were to the eye
From service, to ambience, to food everything was amazing
Highly recommended for a memorable evening!
I just had dinner here with some friends and first of all the place is really cool with all the different rooms
As for the food, I suggest you eat elsewhere and come here for drinks
Basically overpriced chinese food that's not all that
Anyone remember Yumcha?? Exactly
I went there for my birthday dinner with 8 friends
We arrived at the upstairs bar and enjoyed several of their specialty cocktails
Then we were led downstairs to the main room, and were seated at the huge communal dining room table
The candles on our table were cool, and the chairs were comfortable
I suggest having an all appetizer/tapas kind of mean because though then entrees were delicious, it just wasn't enough food for me
I loved the scallion pancakes, alaskan cod (which melted in your mouth), crab fried rice, edamame dim sum, cantonese spring rolls (the crispiest I have ever tasted), peppercorn dessert
I loved everything and the staff was very nice!
I had dinner at Buddakan a few days after it had opened

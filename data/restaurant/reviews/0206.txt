Service was over-the-top even after the place filled up! We literally had a waiter, the sommelier and three staff on hand at all times
The food was perfect
The filet was by far the best Ive had and was cooked perfectly to each of our likings
Creamed spinach actually tasted like spinach and cream amazing! The potatoes were incredible
The breadbaskets (very phallic but in keeping with the dcor) were delicious
This place deserves all the praise it gets
Well done!
This is the best steak I have had in NYC
The crust on the strip steak was perfectly seasoned and the atmosphere is way cool
I have eaten here over 10 times and it is always consistently excellent
Great Strip! The steak here was terrific, nice crust and very tender
Good sauces, good sides, and very cool atmosphere
Overall, I think Dylan Prime is top choice, but Strip House is right up there
I'm from LA and went to the Strip House last Friday night
I had reservations for 4 at 8:30, changed it to 3 people, then ended up with 5 total in my party
The Hostess was amazing and curtious--so were everyone else there
The food was right up there with the best steak houses, and the drinks were strong! It was a pricey dinner
but worth it when you want to impress!
The Hostess at this restaurant is a goddess which makes it a 10 in my book
The foods OK too
steak was great
absolutely fantastic charnice, crisp, rich, flavorful
the brothel theme-cute, a bit over the top, but made for a fun vibe
BUT the service was so painfully nonexistent that i really should pan the place, but the steak
mmmmmmm!
As soon as you walk in you otice the decor: red velevet with lightbox art nudes, promotional headshots cover every other free square inch on the wall
It is well done
The bartenders at the lounger area are excellent and pour a great variety of cocktails all mixed well
The steaks are excellent, my favorite the Rib Chop(most fattening and most flavorful), NY Strip a close second
The tuna here is sushi grade prepared to your liking and quite tasty
The goose fat potatoes are amazing - really a fancy name for Hash Browns
Everything here is superb with the exception of: The seafood medley offered for the table has been weak --- not so fresh
order the steaks
it's a steakhouse!
I wish it could be kept a secret but I suppose everyone should know
The steaks are GREAT - excellent crust , the sides are well thought out (particularly the truffled creamed spinach) and the chocolate cake for dessert is almost too much, almost
The atmosphere is terrific, the strip house theme is taken down to the smallest detail - check out the matches on the way out
All in all a great meal and a great night
the guy before me must be crazy or have no taste
strip house is the steak house to die for
I have tried all the others and i keep coming back because my client love it as do i
All you can ask for in a NY night out
The atmosphere is intimate if on a date and just plain fun if yu are out with friends
The service is friendly but very professional
You are never left hanging and never bothered either
The steaks are so crispy on the outside even at medium rare
The creamed spinach is a marvel with a taste you must try
All in all a very fine representative on NY dining
Expensive but hey, this is New York
From start to finish The meal was wonderful
The side orders--particularly the truffle-scented creamed spinach and the melted heirloom tomatoes atre suberb
The desserts are Fantastic, like the fresh fruit savarin with rum-soaked brioche and Marsala sabayon
unbelievable
The juicy New York strip steaks are the best I've ever had
If yoyu want a great meal in a place as interesting as its name
this is the place
This place was great
The ambiance was perfect for men and women - not always true in a steak house
The food was delicious
Even the offbeat decor (naked ladies silhouettes on the napkins) was really more whimsical than anything else
A great date place!
Wow! We loved this place! I went with a carnivorous group and the food was fantastic
Start with the lobster bisque
Get the strip steak (duh!) and make sure to get the creamed spinach, which is the best in the city
Also you can't go wrong with either kind of potato--goose fat or fried sticks
Skip dessert, not worth the calories
Just have a glass of port and bask in the fatty glow!
Great place to go with any steak lover
I have been there 5 times and every trip has left me wanting to get back
I have been with friends, family, dates - works well if you like good steak and good service
Ate here, four of, a bit pricey but food was good
More of a romantic setting then we anticipated
Very red
dark
I thought their service was great and the steak was delicious! We were sat right on time on a Thursday night and had a wonderful meal
I would highly recommend it and I plan to go back myself

The Food Nick
Went to NS's last night for dinner
The service was HORRIBLE
The table who got there 20 minutes before us had their food before we even had our bread
I had to ask for water 3 times, and our butter that fell on the floor was never replaced despite numerous requests
The food was BLECH
The filet minon was average, and the chicken I had, actually was so dry my throat was scratchy after the meal
For spending $150, McDonalds' would have been a cheaper and better choice! Do not recommend!
I came today with my gf
It was unbelievable
Great cocktail, great service, great food either
I got steak and my gf got shrimp
It is small portion, but
dance your tongue
It is soo tasty
Either the cocktail
What else ?
I will go back
Two thumbs up
I love going to nick and stefs before a game or concert
They offer a great selection of food from spectacular steaks to seafood

Our night was fine until the bill came we realized that they had charged us for a more expensive bottle of wine
The manager came up to us, without asking to hear our side of the story, and argued with us
The expensive bottle is not located near what we ordered on the menu (and when we ordered my friend pointed out the bottle)
(As an aside the bottles themselves were merely labled cabernet so we didn't realized we got the wrong bottle)
Then the manager brought the waitress over and they both caused a loud scene, basically calling us liars
As a former waitress, I know that misunderstanings happen but I have never seen such an unprofessional act
For me, there are plently of restaurants in NYC that are way more deserving of my time and money
Food is good, but place is crowded noisy
I've had HIDEOUS RUDE waiters
One kept trying to yank my plate out from under me when I was still eating and when I said Erm, I was still eating those fries
He shoved the plate in my face and said It's just crumbs, you're done
Another time, friend's parents were visiting and since she lived in the neighborhood, she wanted to go there
Waiter hit me THREE times in the head with either his elbow or the water bottle while leaning over the table and didn't apologize
He spilled half a bottle of water in my lap and just threw me a napkin - no apology
Took us an hour to get our check
Good food is not worth that nonsense
My friend and I met up here the other night to catch-up over dinner
We both decided that a girls night out called for a hamburger and a nice glass of red wine
To our surprise/excitement we never expected to taste such a yummy hamburger
Not only was it juicy but the onion roll/bun was soft and extremely tasteful
In fact we were so motivated to finish our hamburger and tasty fries we passed on the crisp lettuce/salad that accompanies the meal
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a treat
There is also a seating outside (sidewalk) that helps add to the overall experience as well
One of my favorite things to do is come here late with friends, order some bistro bites (merguez sausage especially good) and drinks and spend a few hours listening to live jazz (monday nights) and chilling
Why it took me almost a year to realize this fabulous place serves food until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays is a mystery
regrettably!   Not to mention, the bartenders are gorgeous - all of them
And they make a mean drink
And they have a great Scotch and cognac and French appertif selection if that's your thing
Also a fabulous place for a date
And for steak!
A visit to Bar Tabac quickly transports to you to a small village in France
Yes, the waiters look like they would rather be elsewhwere and the service shows but you are getting a real French experience without spending all that money on airfare
We went to Bar Tabac b/c a friend of a friend was playing some music there and it was amazing
The gypsy french jazz music can be found almost nowhere else!! The food was ok and the wine decently priced
I wouldn't become a regular but it is worth a trip
What a waste of a cool space
Even though it's one of the few places you can hang outside late night, I'd opt for sandwiches in the park
Possibly the worst service I've had ever
Waitress came by once at very beginning
She was really rude
brought 1 beer ten minutes after we ordered a couple beers
We asked three times (the resteurant was not busy) for water, then I just went to the bar
Bartender wouldn't give me water
She said they'll send someone
Went across to the store to get a bottle of water
Waitress left in the middle of shift
We looked around for about 10 minutes for someone to get us our check
which had 3 items that weren't ours on it
Three other tables were wondering around trying to get theri checks too
The place is awful
I am laughing at the review where the person complained about their daquiris and margaritas
um, WHY would you order that in a french restaurant? Glad you found a more serious drinking place
Bar Tabac, on the other hand is a good french bistro-type place that does good mussels and (IMHO) a very nice steak and frites - or at least the best you can get at 11pm on Smith street
Friendly, although sometimes slow service
Great atmosphere
Great selection of wines (haven't had the daquiris yet)
Not great for large groups - we never do more than 4-tops
Not only did we wait intolerably long for our drinks to arrive but the drinks were terrible! Daquiris that were basically rum with ice chunks, margaritas that were seriously lacking in tequila
TERRIBLE! After being treated rudely our large group of serious drinkers found a happy place down the street (Angry Wades) where we proceeded to drink all day and night and leave a VERY hefty tip
In the end who lost out? NOT US!
We were seated promptly but that is where the good service stopped
All we ordered were 7 drinks total, which came 2 at a time in 20 minute intervals
Seeing the annoyed looks on our faces, the waiter kept apologizing that it was the bartender/waitress' first day
That's fine, I will cut her some slack, but don't give her a table of 7 people during a busy shift
We then immediately asked for the check when the last 3 drinks arrived, 40 minutes after the initial two, and were given SERIOUS attitude, which culminated in the check being thrown on our table
The waiter was then heard talking about us, not in a flattering way, in other languages to the surrounding tables
Definitely not a place I would ever go again!!!!!
This place is my favorite neighborhood spot
Yes, it's very French, like France French, not like some guy from Jersey cooked it up and sold it as French
The attitude is French, the staff is (mostly) and the music and vibe are
Love it or hate it, it's a fun spot to spend hours eating, drinking and being merry without someone clocking your time at the table and shuffling you off to leave on their schedule
Try it, it may just be what you're looking for! If you're nice, you'll probably get a glass of very good house champagne for your trouble!!!  And the neighborhood can't be beat for sidewalk table weekend brunch
It's a very nice place to hang out and have a drink, but the food is really below average
Even standard fare like burgers and steaks are dry and taste weird
So come for the drinks and the atmosphere, but eat beforehand
This is my favorite neighborhood place
Great for late night buckets of frites, Sunday sidewalk sunning, or even mellow live music while sitting on a bar stool
Hearty bistro fare that is reliably tasty
Brunch is a winner - love the Eggs Norveigen
Staff is totally friendly
They make the place feel like home
It's a little piece of France, attitude and all
This little place is great for lounging around with friends, listening to live jazz and then lounging around with friends some more
Food is pretty standard fare and prices are reasonable, but it's all about the very relaxed atmosphere
Good for drinks or bruch
I went here with a friend, being told it was a good place to eat
Well, the food is okay, but the service is HORRID!!! We had to ask 3 times for water, fine
I asked the waiter for the bill, and as he dropped it off he apologized for the service because they were short staffed
Fine
He then proceeded to take a cigarette break in front of us and we were ready to pay the bill! Give me a break you were short staffed! You're just LAZY! Needless to say, he didn't even get a 5% tip
I went there for lunch and brunch and both times had a very good meal
I can recommend the brochettes, they are realy yummy
The service is very good and the place has a cozy bistro atmosphere
The Scene Not since the early '80s has Soho seen so much pink neon
The garish glow (intensified by mirrored ceilings, walls and floors) begins at the long bar and extends under chintz banquettes and white plastic chairs, past a gigantic gold Buddha, to the bustling open kitchen
Droves of downtown hipsters keep indefatigable servers running for pastel-colored cocktails
The Food The towering stacks of Thai food, swathed with colorful sauce swirls and orchid garnishes, taste as good as they look, and are surprisingly inexpensive
Don't miss crispy, chutney-drizzled ginger calamari cooled with avocado-scallion emulsion, chubby roasted leek rolls or golden shrimp semolina fritters
Entrees, such as perfectly seared sake-marinated swordfish, rare "deconstructed" strip steak alongside rich peanut sauce and moist, smoke-charred chicken, are less elaborate thrills
Stick to traditional pad thai packed with fresh vegetables; the fusion pastas, such as greasy duck vermicelli, are ill-conceived disappointments

I'm delighted to say that the staff are the most friendliest people I have ever met
The atmosphere is relaxing and and is a breath of fresh air after a hard days work
Great menu for children
We went there to celebrate my birthday
I fell in love with the ambiance, the food and the service
The food is just phenomenal
We ordered frog legs and mushroom ravioli for appetizers and for the main course, I got the Tilapia
The fish was cooked just right and the potatoes were really good
Creme brulee was amazing
The prices were reasonable and its definitely worth going there again
I will be making more visits out there
The restaurant is pretty small
There were 2 of us and our table was literally in between two other couples
If you can by that, the food is good and the staff is very accomodating
The prices are reasonable
I lived in Paris and walking into this place was deja vu all over again! Service is impeccable and warm and the food is just out of this world
Although the menu is more meat driven, the salmon and skate dishes are done to perfection
We ate a 3 course dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine and coffee for just over $100
I found out about this place by accident and have been in love with it since
I keep bringing friends to dinner here and they've all agreed with me
Gavroche is a wonderful place to eat fine food in a charming place without breaking the bank
The hostess will also make sure that you feel at home
This place is not for the loud and trendy
It's for the discriminating foodie who wants to enjoy food, talk, and celebrate love!
The Prix Fixe is a total bargain and can't be beat, but our tab ended up being $100 or so because we got a little careless with ordering the wine
What motivated me to go to Gavroche was a TimeOut review saying that one of the chefs is from Troisgros in Lyon
It was totally worth it
Every single thing was great, especially the steak frites- they got the sauce just right
The service was great - I wasn't expecting much in terms of service (two kids in bluejeans with backpacks), but they treated us very well
Also the tres real deal
The sincere French proprietress herself ushers you into a simple, very French room that manages to be at once spare and warm
Dark wood 10-seat bar comfily accomodates those who prefer at-bar dining
Menu provides many options, all true to country French style
don't miss the cheese charcuterie (cold sliced meats/fish) boards, or the escargot, if either of those standbys appeal to you
Hangar steak melts in your mouth but comes in a red wine sauce, so be advised
Fantastic value, and sincere cordial service
A bientot!
For excellent food, service and atmosphere, this is a must
You will feel like you are in Paris enjoying the fine food in the relaxed, main dining room or tranquil garden
One of the best French restaurants in the area
Off the beaten up and congested path that is 14th St, you can find a mostly empty, dark front room of a fairly typical looking French place
In fact, it doesn't look all that different from an Italian place right up the street
The difference comes when you are led through a narrow, painted brick hallway, leading to a hidden back garden
I am reluctant to even write this as I feel like I'm giving up a secret
The classic french fare includes mussels that you sop up wiht the hot and crusty bread
The roasted beet slad is clean and delicious
Steak frites, coq au vin, roasted cod all were a pleasure, as was the creme brulee and apple tart special
You will want to take freinds there but you won;t want them to ruin your perfect secret garden
This place is amazing
I am always downtown and this spot is great especially now in the summer with the AC and music blasting
They have a patio in back where you and your friends can relax, surf the web with your laptop and enjoy the food which is not only healthy but delicious too
Great place to get something to eat if your shopping or just hanging around the village
John has amazing taste, I was so impressed with everything that he created, from the presentation of dishes, to the freshness of the ingredients, to his warm, detail oriented staff
His pricing is reasonable, he is so flexable and helpful
The food was so creative and healthy! I couldn't believe it
The guests were so pleased because there was something for everyone
Bravo!
if you want to experience an exciting revolution of taste ,well just try john's food and you will understand what i mean !!!!!
Was lucky enough to experience a true Professinal and Savor food that was second to none ! My dining experience for a dinner party I held for my company was beyond words, each course was better then the one before
John brings new meaning to the old saying From Soup To Nuts !!!!!!
Chef John has such an ability with ingredients and a genial touch in amalgamating them
to a surprising outcome
His ability to make the best from French and Italian experiences, plus his supreme creativity, allow for an extremly tasty Cuisine
His dishes are highly choreographic too
Wonna be surprised and deliver to your mouth suprEEEEme tastes? Well Guys, I engaged him for my wedding in Italy and loved my choice all the way
The OHHs and UHMMs among the guests were plentiful, you can bet
! Chef John's also due for an appearance on an Italian TVnetwork
Chef John Light is someone who onces found you never let go of
Ive travelled the world round and no doubt, Chef Johns touch is unique, his dishes are delectable and delicious as well as eye catching
Dont miss the opportunity for your parties and society gatherings!!
Chef John Light's food is da bomb
KA-BOOM! I am very particular about what I eat -- and saying that his dishes are delectable is an understatement
I've had his veal, chicken, beef, roasted beets, potatoes, unusual salads
I'm getting hungry just thinking about his menus! I can honestly say I like his food better than Cipriani, and I really love their risotto and crepes -- but overall, I would say John is BETTER!
one of the most friendly chef's you will ever meet! food was delicious!
The experience is amazing
The tasting menu never ends
The food is divine
It is without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had the pleasure of tasting
It is a very humbling, individual experience where the sushi clearly takes the spotlight
And above all the price is too too reasonable
Definitely comming back
This place has very reasonable priced sushi, with the emphasis on rolls; they have sushi and sashimi too, the usual fare, but the rolls
they have lots of kinds of them - strangely, they are named after people and are almost all the same, using about 7 different ingredients and a million variations of them
I found the freshness to be so-so, mostly because I ordered two of these special rolls which both had real crab
well the real crab was probably from frozen or something, because the flavor was way too strong to be from fresh, so it overpowered alot of the other kinds of fish like hamachi and tuna, which from what I can tell tasted pretty fresh
My recommendation is if you go here, avoid the real crab and go for the standard fare, unremarkable, but a bargain
This is the best priced and quality sushi in the East Village
Went with a group after work
The sushi was extremely fresh and tasty
Place is not that big but it does have a relaxing atmosphere to have a great meal with friends
Dont miss out!
Before I entered the restaurant, I was a little worried since there were only 2 tables occupied(it was around 8:00pm and the chief was not a Japanese
Anyway, I was so surprised when I saw the price of menu
It was pretty cheap!  Then, after I tasted the sushi, I understood why it was so cheap
The california roll looked ugly
All the sushi were terrible
dried rice! Any sushi from plastic containers at any deli might taste much better
I was so embarrassed because I trusted the reviews below
The sushi here was A-one! Very fresh and very affordable

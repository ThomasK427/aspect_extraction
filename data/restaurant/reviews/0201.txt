Soemone needs to go to Danny Meyer school
Make it a foursome, order a delicious bottle of wine, and let the fromagier surprise you
Order a salad or two so the kitchen won't sulk
The entrees are OK, but for onglet frites, you'd be better off a couple of blocks away at Les Halles
This restaurant is just fantastic! I am often a solo diner, and often get treated like the local leper
I mess up somebody's table with a single meal, and wait staff hate me
Artisanal treats me like a favorite aunt with attentive service
And the food is to die for
In 6 years in NYC, I have never found such a restaurant where I eagerly await my revisit
I limit myself to once a week, and in six months
they have never disappointed me
The Prix-fixe brunch, lunch, dinner menus are exceptional
Wine by the glass is extensive, moderately priced
The cheese is the reason to come here
Not only is the selection fantastic, but you can be certain that the cheese is stored correctly and served at the peak of taste and texture
Walk up to the cheese counter and ask for the recommendations - they'll find something to suit your palate
The wines by the glass selection is also wonderful, so you will be able to get a good pairing
The service is, unfortunately, sadly lacking, and the menu outside of the cheeses is a bit weak
If you are a cheesehound, however, these weaknesses can be forgiven for the best cheese outside of Paris
Absolutely incredible that such a restaurant would run out of 5 dishes incl
the recurring Saturday plat du jour, the steak and filet mignon
But even worse, was that our waitress never apologized for it even when we told her that we had been planning to have the plat du jour
She really wasn't pleasant at all and we had to pour our own wine and water
The cheeses were however fabulous - and such a wide range of choice - which somewhat made up for the other shortcomings
Artisanal is not just about cheese but wine, mussels, fries and seafood too! I had a great date there and we were treated like gold!
We had reservations for lunch, and were immediately seated upon arrival
Service was good, but the seating was a little cramped as the tables are very close together
We enjoyed the 100 cheese fondue and really liked the chocolate fondue for dessert
Cost about $100 for two at lunch
Went there with a group, and 1/2 of them were late, but the host was very accommodating
The Cheese fondue was delicious and the wait staff was very helpful and genuinely nice
The food was excellent and the atmosphere was also pleasant
With all the fabulous restaurants in NYC--many of which have phenomenal cheese selections--I can't believe I got suckered into this place
Attitude is one thing, but horrible service is another
And bad food? I don't think so
The restaurant is so crowded the servers are tripping on each other, and are so busy they just don't seem to have time for the customers
Our waiter never stopped by to ask how our meals were (my spinach was, unbelievably, full of sand), didn't ask if we wanted anything else, and threw our check on the table as he passed by
But he had time to stop back three (3) times to see if we'd signed the bill yet--and then checked the tip while we sat there! Oh, and the cheese? Head to Zabar's
I took two of my friends there for their birthdays and had a wonderful experience
Very attentive staff and the cheese menu is amazing
We started the meal off with a terrific fontina and white truffle oil fondue
I followed that with nicely prepared scallops with eggplant chutney
The service was impeccable and the food tasty, would definitely go again
The Scene Apropos of its name, Porters engenders the spirit of an early-20th-century bourgeois dining car, with a narrow, rectangular shape, mahogany paneling and Art Deco light fixtures
From the moment you walk in the door, there is a pronounced sense of performance to the dinner experience, as if you have stepped into a life-sized museum piece
Servers wear pink button-down oxfords with trim, tightly-knotted bow ties
The coup de grace is the electric shoeshine machine in the bathroom
The Food An aged, anachronistic brand of continental fare delivered without an ounce of perceivable irony
Breaded diver scallops like those offered here must have been the sort of sustenance over which grain futures were discussed at downtown patron saint Harry's at Hanover Square in the 1920s--before anybody knew what an emulsion, a coulis or the NASDAQ were
Looks nice at first, but they add 20% service charge for parties of TWO or more, and the service is TERRIBLE
When I complained to the manager, he became argumentative, then abusive! I'm an experienced journalist reviewer, and I would never go back to this place
Been there recently, definetly will come back
Intimate athmosphere at the bar,cute gilrls and boys and above all exellent food
Service above average
Check their garden or lounge for some extra privacy
Not to forget great music in the backgound
Great neigbourhood
My wife and I came into NYC the afternoon of 6/29
We stopped by Porters at roughly 4:30 which is no eating time by NY standards; however we were seated right away and were served
The Burger was excellent, one of the best ones my wife has ever had
I had the Tortellini of which was pertty good
When I do come back to NYC, I would like to come back
When Porter's first opened, they took great pride in their service
However, like most middle-of-the-road restaurants in NYC, that sense of pride gets overrun with something else, and that something else is--not good!  Our dining experience on 4
21
04 was simply that--not good! We sat way before 2 other tables ahead of us that rec'd their appetizers before us; the waiter neglected to apologize
When returning our credit card, he gave us someone else's card
For 2 patrons paying over $100 for dinner, you'd think that the waiter would check to see if everything was okay with the dining experience, and he certainly did not
At one point, the cook had to notion to our waiter to take our plates
Before coming here, think about the money you are going to spend, and if it's worth the bad service
I went with a friend on a beautiful Sunday morning and sat in the outdoor seating area
The service was attentive and the brunch prices reasonable
The bread was served hot and the mimosa delicious
There was also a piano player serving up some great jazz tunes
I am surprised it wasn't more crowded
I'll definitely be back
I've been to Porters maybe 10 times now, and it's pretty much my favorite restaurant in Chelsea
It's upscale but not pretentious
Most importantly (to me at least) the food is outstanding, every time
I highly recommend the crab cakes and ANY fish on the menu
I'm kinda glad that this place hasn't blown up yet, because it will eventually and then I'll need a month-in-advance reservation
I stopped into Porter's to meet a few friends and have some drinks before we checked out some clubs in the area and was pleasantly surprised
There was a hopping bar scen and many groups of young, attractive women sitting around that were there to pre-game just like I was
It is a great atmosphere to casually make a connection before heading out to Sessa or Serena
The bartenders were not up to the task of serving the busy scene, I guess they arte used to dealing with the dinner crowd
Went on Valentines Day  Ran out of bread, terrible service, high priced, uncooked, poor quality food, rude staff, watery drinks  The staff ran back and forthdown the main aisle all night  There was nothing good about this place
There are only a few tables in the restaurant
Most are in close proximity to the bar and lounge sections, replete with cigarette smoke (Bloomy will be changing that soon)
That being said, our food was good, properly seasoned, and the wine list was a goodie
The service was very accomodating and helpful, our wine and water glasses were never empty
The decor is rather elegant, but not pretentiously overdone as you might expect to find in Chelsea (although my seat cushion was a bit stained)
Definitely worth a visit once the smoking ban goes into effect
I've been to Porters three times now
The food is good
The staff can be attentive
But it's overpriced, especially considering the cuisine isn't exactly creative
With so many other great restaurants, why go to somewhere that's just o
k
?

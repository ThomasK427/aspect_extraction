One, Max Magic Blackcurrant was unbelieveable and refreshing
I can't wait for the new speciailty cocktails for the Fall
I was visiting my family from India, and they insisted that we try both the food and ambiance of Bombay Talkie
I was breathless at the becor and the authentic cuisine
I have to say I got a bit tipsy having had a few of the fabulous cocktails
This is truly a must for anyone coming from abroad that has a hankering for Indian food
The best shrimp kebabs, lamb chops and dessert I ever had
There was a Tapioca dessert with a spicy touch and fruit compote, a signature dessert which was one of the best desserts I have ever had in the city
Has anyone talked about the music here
The mix is fabulous
When are the CDs coming out?!
Really thought the food here was excellent
The eggplant tandori was fabulous
The mahi mahi was tremendous
The service was perfectly fine
The drinks were a little disappointing - not that strong, not that tasty - but the food more than made up for it
I was so surprised to find such a fabulous restaurant in New York City which makes the Indian restaurants in London, surprisingly, feel so much inferior
I was blown away by the cuisine, service, music and decor
I cannot say more than to just say that you must pay a visit
You would never think that I was a person who liked spices, but Bombay Talkie has incredibly created a cuisine that just has the right amount of spice and heat that even I was shocked by
What a lovely spot
The drinks are great too
Definitely try the Indian beers
I just want to compliment the staff on such fabulous service for our bachelorette party
We could not get enough of the speciality cocktails
I think they are the best in the city
The Manager was fabulous and sent us a free round of shots
Don't mistake me
We ate and ate and ate
The food was amazing
The music wanted us to get up on the communal table and dance the night away, but we had some control
We had a wonderful time
I highly recommend this place for parties
I am from abroad, and I have never had such delecious food
In addition, the specialty drinks themselves are a reason to go
Fabulous experience
Forget the lone ratings of the always disgruntled
You will always get that
Trust me
This is a wonderful place
Cozy and glam; eye candy galore: from the food to the paintings to the decor -- have been to BT 4x in the past month and my friends are falling for it too
Great apps and delicous main courses -- love the tapia fish and the clay oven chicken
Pure perfection! Me and my friends had the best evening at Bombay Talkie
The food, drinks, and staff were wonderful
My friends from England are use to the best Indian on Brick Lane in London and they couldn't believe how great the food was at Bombay Talkie
Also it is very good in price; not too expensive
All must it this Indian haven a try
Went here the other night with three friends
Wow
what a find
The food, service and decor was amazing! The drinks are wonderful and different
If you like Indian food in an atmosphere that offers a cool chelsea vibe, this is a restaurant you should try!
We were sat at the communal trough-like table--when your meal is coming out to over $60 each, you really are putting up with a lot to have people elbowing you and listening in on your conversation
I ordered one of the lamb dishes recommended by the waitress
For $15, it was three TINY meatblalls of lamb in a small bowl of rice
It was flavorful, but dry, but give me a break!!! A Falafel sandwhich in the East Village is more food, and while not as fancy, comes in for more that $5 a ball of food with some rice!!! While we were at the trough, we watched an empty table neverr fill that we could have sat at
At least theyhad the sense not to ask us if everything was alright, after the the food was served!!!! Overall, a very expensive, very horrible experience, unless masochism is your thinig
First of all, the food is great
It's innovatively prepared, perfectly spiced, and very tasty
But that's about it
The service, or lack thereof, completely undoes all the positives of good fare
The staff is very unknowledgable about the various items on the menu
The restaurant goes for the superchic mode, and in the process loses out on knowledgeable or helpful wait staff
In addition, they got my order wrong twice--in the same meal
Prices are also pretty high given small portions
This place is decent if you want to hang out with friends (who don't mind paying up) in a low-key atmosphere with good food, but don't mind putting up with sub-par level of service
If this is place is so bad, why is it always packed? I love this restaurant
I've eaten there many times and the only complaint i could ever have is occasionally, the service has been a little slow
The food is always tasty and the portion size is just right
This is modern Indian food - not greasy and heavy
Went with a couple of friends and we all loved it
Were treated like Royalty
We all LOVED the food, which was very different and interesting
Loved the Chicken Vindaloo, which was not too spicy
The manager, who was absolutely wonderful, did inform us that the chef is happy to make the food as spicy as you like
We all had a great time and I can't wait to go back
First off, the food and ambience are great, by and large
Avoid the daal makhani and the claypot chicken, though
The fish and lamb are excellent
The wait staff was ok - they made a couple of mistakes with the orders, and we had to send back some stuff
However, the manager was ridiculously arrogant and rude
We had specifically requested that each table get a separate check so that folks were not charged unfairly
We were a party of 15 divided amongst 3 tables, with some drinkers and some non-drinkers
Needless to say, this did not happen, and when we asked why, instead of an apology, we got hostile remarks from the manager
We are typical NY yuppies who eat out a lot in Manhattan, but I cant remember a more unpleasant dining experience
The Scene An intricately carved wooden door, curtains of soft orange and red, and colorful hanging lanterns dress up an interior that's reminiscent of an average Indian restaurant, only much nicer
The same can be said of the exotic cocktails enjoyed by the wildly diverse but astutely cosmopolitan crowd
The real buzz at the bi-level space, however, comes from chefs Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur's accomplished menu
The Food The freshness and essence of ingredients shines through in dishes, enhanced by complex spices
The crackling of crispy rice and bean cakes, mixed with curry, mustard seed, tomato and mint makes the Idly Umpa a superb starting point
Seafood lovers can't go wrong with the Parsi halibut, topped with a cool mint chutney, or the tandoor-grilled prawns, perfectly cooked specimens
Vegetarians can exercise a myriad of options, from to hearty yam dumplings to stuffed eggplant aided by a spicy peanut sauce
Went for Restaurant Week Lunch and had a horrendous experience
The food was not fresh, the naan was hot and rubbery like it had been microwaved, chicken was tough and unflavorful, had 2 send back two dishes
Instead of replacing the chicken, the waiter claimed the kitchen was closed and returned with the same dish with added sauce!!!! (suprise surprise, it was still bad)
To top it all off, the manager whom I requested to speak with, was soo amazingly rude
His response to my expression of disappointment was, Have you ever had Indian food before? and I guess this means you are trying to get stuff taken off the bill
He was so nasty, you would have thought we had done something wrong
he walked away while I was still talking to him, not even the least bit concerned or apologetic and he never returned back to our table once he stormed away to consult with the chef, to determne what could be done
some manager

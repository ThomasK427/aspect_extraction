My husband had the lobster sandwich which was okay - better off going to Marys fishcamp which not only gives you more for your money but also a hell of alot tastier
Someone please explain to me why there is a wait to get seated here? Did I mention that each beer costs $9 ?
Went Friday and when they say 1 and 45 minute wait, they're not kidding
So, went to Sin Sin for cocktails while waiting
The menu is limited
They ran out of clams? We had the raw bar sampler
The oysters were delish and shrimp was average
For entrees I had the skate and my friend, the lobster sammy
I didn't care for my sides (a grape salad w/pureed chick peas that was bland)
The lobster roll was great as were the fries, but it came with a $22 price tag
The wines were good, try the french rose
My favorite was the chocolate pudding
I grew up by the water, so seafood is a no brainer
It's about quality and freshness, not how good the chef is
Do I like is better than Mary's Fish Camp, I'll have to give this place another try and get back to you
This place is really unbelievable
The service is dead on from the people answering the phones (the girl spent 5 minutes explaining the directions and was amazingly patient) to the wait staff and the managers (so nice!) and the food is equally as great
I had to wait a while but it was well worth it and I was made to feel so comfortable at this place
I would suggest it to anyone who likes superb service and fantastic food
We went to The Mermaid Inn after hearing such amazing things about it and it lived up to every expectation
The mussels were amazing and for dinner we had the Swordfish and the Lobster salad sandwich, both of which were out of this world
There was a long wait but it was well worth it
You definitely won't leave this place dissappointed
food was good, but i expected better judging from the many rave reviews on this site
i had the raw oysters and the skate
definitely on the pricy side
we got free chocolate pudding for dessert (do they always do that?)
friendly waitstaff
very new england feel to the place
rugby shirts, chinos, whaling posters
think cape cod
this place is worth a try, but i don't plan on returning
WHAT A FIND! I went to this place last Monday after a performance and was seated immediately
But even if I had to wait, I would wait for the delicious BBQ shrimp cocktail and oysters, both fresh and fried
Everything on the menu beckons, so I will have to be making a return trip soon, if only to sample more of the delicious entrees and salads
Definitely come on Mon-Wed to avoid the cattle call
Top notch attention to details, food, wine, service oriented attitude, and prices to match the neighborhood, this place totally rules! They have a small garden out back for some under-the-stars dining, which I will gladly return here for at next occasion
If they took reservations I'm sure there'd be a 30-day wait!
Worth the wait
The food is to die for; the staff is warm, welcoming, and well informed, and the atmosphere is cozy and hip
This resaurant is everything you could ask for in fine dining, without the pretention and the high prices
Well done!
I had a great time in the Mermaid Inn! The food, the prices and the staff were well worth the wait to be seated
(I am not the only one who heard about this place and decided to go there
) Best wine prices in town! You don't want to miss this one when you are in town
This place is great
As much as I don't want people to find out about it (no ressies) I feel too selfish keeping it to myself
The food is really great and the service is fantastic
I eat out all the time and never have I come across such a friendly and knowledgeable staff
Check it out
Though the atmosphere is delightful, drawing an attractive over-40 crowd, the service at this East Village newcomer has a lot to be desired
Blame it perhaps on an inexperienced waitstaff, but hey, don't give us another basket of breadsticks and flatbread with our dessert, say you're sorry, and pluck it down on the table next door
and dump that signature drink! The food did save the experience
So, maybe wait a few months until the service improves, and you'll enjoy yourself
Went for dinner last week on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too crowded
Small menu but everything we had was excellent
The raw bar sampler appetizer was extremely fresh
The lobster sandwich was so yummy
The skate was tasty and went well with the salad it came with
The waiter was very friendly and informative
Prices were reasonable
Good mix of people
Atmosphere was unpretentious
Overall, a very pleasant evening
We were at the Mermaid Inn last Friday and had ordered some raw oysters from the West Coast
they were so firm, fresh and creamy
Better than those we ordered from Pearl Oyster Bar
The lobster sandwiches was also very good
The fried oysters was ok and the blue crab dip could be better if it's thicker
Our waitress was nice and it was almost a perfect evening for us
It's tiny, loud children friendly (!!!???!!!)
THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS, so go early and have a drink (or 2 or 3 ) at the bar while you wait for your table
We got there at 6:30 pm and had to wait for 1 hour to be seatted
However, it was all worth it
I'd do it all over again because the food was delicious! I sugggest that you order several appetizers and share them because they are to die for
Prices were reasonable
Wine list is small and overpriced but the bubbly by the glass was pretty good
what a cute place
very east village, but classy, and classic dishes with some spins, and well done
wanna have a good time in a busy restaurant, try it, but go early or late
a restaurant with class, professionalism, killer wine list (and prices), and an awesome chef! I can't stop eating at this joint
welcome to the neighborhood!
Great little restaurant that tries hard to please
Wonderful attentive wait staff and hostesses
Nice space in the back room
The food was good and creative but our entrees were extremely salty
Hopefully that was a one time event
Would definitely go back again
Order the pasta with seafood sauce - it was inedible! We thought perhaps someone had emptied an entire box of salt into the pasta water - really! Seafood sauce was strange and tasteless
Appetizers were very good, as reviewed
Waited almost 2 hours
Service pleasant
Wouldn't go back
Visited The Mermaid this weekend with some friends and decided this is our new favorite east village restaurant
We sat outside at a great table in the garden
We were shocked by how they have priced some great bottles of wine so low
The food was delicious
And the staff is very friendly and accomodating
We'll be going back very soon
Excellent! Everyone was so friendly from the hostess to the bar to the table

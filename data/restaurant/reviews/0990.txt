After 90 minutes of waiting - 90 MINUTES - with little bits of food being brought piecemeal to the table, we gave up and went elsewhere
Our experience did have some humor though since we saw the same waiter spill on 2 different customers
You only have a few disasterous dinners like this in one lifetime
This place is a laughable waste of money, all about the hype and the decor with little attention on the food and service
We waited 30 min to get our hot sake, which came out cold
The food came out staggered, 3 dishes at one time and then nothing for a half hour
The sweet shrimp was cold
The kobe beef skewer was delicious but shockingly overpriced for 3 bites of food
Our server was downright pretentious and would roll her eyes when we asked about the food, claiming this is how it is done in tokyo
Well, I've been to Tokyo, 3 times, and never had service this bad
Unless you want to overpay for mediocre service and food, skip this place
My wife and I celebrated her 50th Birthday at Megu
We are so glad we chose Megu because we had the most memorable experience
We went with the Kobe sampler menu ($150 ea
)
For drinks we had delicious cold sake
O
k
it was extravagant but it was a milestone birthday
The decor was magical and each dish (about 11 in all) was a masterpiece in and of itself from texture flavor to presentation
I won't give away the rest because each and every dish was a surprise
The staff was knowledgeable, pleasant and attentive without being annoying
We showed up at 6:30 and desert arrived around 9:30
This ritual style isnt for everybody but we loved it
The Kobe beef was spectacular
The regular menu has a wide price range so we will definitely return
By 8pm the place was packed so other folks obviously feel the same way
One of my great dinner experiences
I did the $120 tasting menu on my own and it was awe inspiring
The whole restaurant experience is designed to overwhelm your senses, with the smooth service, stunning decor and over the top food
There were a few moments during the tasting menu that left me speechless, such as the shrimp in cream sauce, toro with foam, foie gras custard, eggplant in miso and a foie gras kobe beef filet fried ball that brought me to tears
I was so blown away I returned two days later with my friend
He got the tasting menu I had and I was given something different
and I was still blown away
The only negative is if you are going to eat late (after 9) then I wouldn't do the tasting menu since it takes a long time (2 1/2 hours) and they might rush you
The chef will not alter any of the three tasting menus
As a result, you will become a second-class citizen at your own table
As the only alacarte diner, I ate with takeout quality chopsticks while the rest of my party got a utensils upgrade
My food was often placed in the center of the table with all diners left to wonder whether it was part of the tasting menu or not, or else I was cruelly taunted by being served part of the tasting menu then having food yanked out from under me at the last minute
At least I was spared the lectures on what and how to eat my food
I did, however, enjoy the ritualistic buddha-watering and watching several nervous may-december dates at the nearby tables
I have dined at Megu several times and it has been amazing
The space itself is amazing- definitely one of the most beautiful restaurants in NYC
Everyone there was sooo nice and helpful- they better be to help guide us through that terribly overwhelming menu
Not only that, but the food is exquisite too
Everything just melts in your mouth
The dishes are so creative, especially in the tasting menu
I could have had several of each of the dishes they served us
Its definitely pricey, but worth it
All in all, a wonderful experience
:)
We patronized the space where Megu sits in its two previous incarnations as Japanese restaurants and Megu is by far the best
The space is enormous and very unique with a Buddha ice sculpture in the center of it all
Decor is over the top and the food is the same
The small dishes are presented and sometimes prepared at the table
Very showy but the food holds up to the show
Servings were tiny, just enough to make you want more
The service was excellent and attentive
Do the tasting menu if you have 3 hours
Prices make it strictly a special occasion place
Megu is expensive with tasting menus of $100, $150, and up and a kobe beef filet for $60
But the food was amazing
We went with a group of 5 and they warned us that if someone ordered the tasting menu that at least 2 people had to
I found this rather strange but I guess this is because the tasting menu took so long that it requires a 3 hour meal
I had the filet and it was the best steak I've ever had
The booths and tables are large so this is more of a restaurant for groups but I highly recommend it
Overall, this giant ultra chic shrine to sushi and gourmet Japanese cuisine lived up the immense hype that surrounds it's name
Sushi, sashimi and cooked fare were nothing short of excellent
Service was not snooty and you'll be treated the same whether you order one of the $150+ kaiseki dinners or a single entree
The Japanese Caesar salad was absolutely phenomenal as was the spicy miso soup
A surprising strength of Megu is the top notch dessert menu, a rare trait among Japanese restaurants
Dessert is a must at Megu
And don't forget to pay a visit to the futuristic ultra serene bathrooms upstairs
Megu is expensive, but dining experiences like this do not come cheap
Megu is worth it
From the moment we began browsing the extensive and exciting menu, we knew we were in for a treat
The knowledgeable wait staff, while lacking the same sense of urgency we felt in keeping our innovative and tasty cocktails full was helpful in guiding us through the many choices
From the sampler of Japanese oysters, to the top 5 best tuna sushi rolls, to the chateaubriand style Kobe beef (worth every multiple penny) our table shared one delicious bite after the other! The variety of original desserts kept us ordering with a lovely green tea crepe and cream puff, but a mediocre g-t creme brulee
Top that off with the restaurant center piece, a melting ice wishing Buddha and we felt, while expensive, the quality of food and the overall dinning experience was definately one we would recommend and look forward to experiencing again in the very near future
Came here twice so far-- Once on a Sunday, and once on a Friday
We thought our disappointment for the Sunday dinner was due to the fact that Sunday's are generally bad for japanese food
Therefore, we came back on a Friday, and we were even less impressed
We were extremely hungry (and drunk) by the end of a very very very (need I say very one more time?) slow meal
The service was stilted
The food is definitely good, but it's not tasty and creative or best I've had (and trust me, I'm a japanese food/sake fanatic)
I feel bad for saying that I'm *not* impressed, but that's the truth
I still don't get what the big deal about this place is
This was a great looking spot for a business dinner - you can feast your eyes on the decor the food presentation was meticulously prepared
But for my bang for th buck even if on company expense, I would avoid this as the sushi fare was not up to par, even with the imaginative dishes, we all agreed we expected great sushi but didn't get it
Also the service was terrible, the wait staff didn't know 1/2 the menu, they even had to read it with us
Bar/water service was disappointingly slow
Overall, save your bucks go elsewhere
We were all still hungry after paying $150 per person!!
I have never felt so taken at a restaurant as I was the other night at Megu
Conveniently the tasting menu which is somewhat affordable, is not offered on weekends
You are forced to look through a menu that is so complex that it should be illegal
The food is so average in somecases below average
The waiter had the nerve to bring items that we did not order becuase he thought we would like it
The portions are so tiny no wonder they recommend ordering many items
For $425 a couple we left partially hungry

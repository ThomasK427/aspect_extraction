Oh, the Indian is great here too
My family was flying the next day and I decided to take them out
Instead of being impressed, they were appalled by the service we received from the waitress
She was EXTREMELY rude and had a really bad attitude
I never give reviews but this is something people should know about
At last,good food and great music, better than the chippies at home
Great variety on the menu and all extremely affordable
Excellent service and excellent food
Top marks
Love this place---Casual, bright, cheery and just frickin fun
PLUS they have a take out
go for the desserts
you haven't experienced sin until you've had a deep fried candy bar
The worst fish and chips I ever had was actually in England, but this place has some of the best
It's as authentic as it can get in NY
Try the chip butty if you have a chance, but the mushy peas are like baby food
Eew
I recently had a very bad lunch at the chipshop
with the fact that I am english I went in very excited about the food
But I was so dissapointed by it
It was in no shape or form authentic , in fact it was just bad the chips were really greasy and soggy and I have no idea where they got the recipe for their curry sauce but it was not England
The batter on the sausage was non existent it had all fallen off and was on the plate swimming in grease
So my advice is go for the nice service but have a salad
I went here on New Years Day for the full English breakfast
The food was authentic enough, but the service was horrendous! They kept forgetting us and it took almost 45 minutes to get a fried candy bar
If you go, refuse any table next to a wall - you have to be right underfoot so they pay attention to you
Food is top draw
Better than chip shops back home in fact
Steak and kidney pie is the pick for me, but its all good
Massive portions as well
Very relaxed with a blowout 'full english' brekky available for extreme hangovers that need taming
Good for kids and families as well
We have been there mob handed with kids and adults, and the staff were very good
A mate of mine takes his kids there, and they love it
Can't say enough about the place
Great for brits and irish who want a taste of home
A place where americans can taste proper british food
Everything about this place is great! Don't forget the desserts, they are so delicious! Service is great! Ask for Hayden, he's one of the best servers!!!!!!
For English greasy fish and chips, it really hits the spot, I'm English so I should know! So odd that the lowest of the low in take-away food in England should be elevated and served as restaurant food in NYC
But they do it well here and the captivating decor evokes many a passed event from Memory Lane in England
For those not interested deep-fried fish and chips (a
k
a
fries to you Americans), there are other options
My partner chose a chicken balti which was competently put together
The beef and onions pies had me reliving nights out with the lads in my youth
Ill be back to sample them another time
Since the fry-up blew the diet anyway, why not try the deep-fried mars bar to finish
Sounds desperate but is actually sickly, gooey and wonderful! Give it a go if youre a Brit| hungry for home
Knowing my love of all things English, my friends took me here for my birthday
The fish chips are to die for, as are treats like fried macaroni cheese and fried candy bars (try the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup)! It's affordable and has a very authentic feel! Highly recommended!
After reading the reviews here, I decided I would have to try this place while on a business trip to Manhattan
After a brief Subway ride, I was seated and ready to feast on a order of Halibut Chips, which laid before me
Simply the best fish chips I've ever had
The fish was very flavorful, and firm, with a crisp batter
The chips were equally great
I'd definitely come back again
I came with 2 screaming kids a party of 5 adults, we were seated within 10 minutes booster seats were provided for the kids
The waiters were lovely patient the food delicious inexpensive
I only wish there were more places like this around
Thank you Chipshop
Its good
Its good
Its the best fish n chips in the city
The shepards pie is good, the mac n cheese is great, the three berry stew is so tasty
Its all good
Eat there
A simple meal of fish chips is tasty and crunchy, and the wait staff ARE very cute - with that accent we can't resist
Order the fried mars bar just to say you did! The house is small so get there early!
Its great
Much better than Tea and Sympathy: better food, better value, better service, better khazi - everything
I had a great cod 'n' chips
Only minor moan is that the tea wasn't PG Tips or anything and the mushy peas were a bit buttery
All in all its a top gaff
Am planning a revisit to sample the curry next door
The Chip Shop rocks
The fish is super fresh, the chips just the right combonation of crispy and soft, and the curry is unBELEivable
The waitstaff is always friendly and on the ball
My personal favorite is the decoupage loo--the walls are covered with British tabloid headlines
This is our favorite neighborhood place, and worth the trek from Manhattan
I liked the fish, and the salads are great too
A good bargain, and a fun place to hang out and chill
for an american of english descent, i love the idea of chip shop
now in new york, a city replete with every cuisine imaginable, english has a spot as well! the tchotchkies on the wall are hillarious, and the china plate that the fish and chips arrive on screams England
i lament the fact though that the cod stocks in the atlantic are so depleted, that the flaky, soft, melt-in-your-mouth cod fillets i remember as a boy are hard to come by, and chip shop's cod comes off a little bit tough, but that's not their fault
the chips were delightful and with a generous sprinkling of malt vinegar, went perfectly with a pint of boddington's
well worth the subway ride and the $14! God Save the Chip Shop!
menu inspiring - so much good stuff to choose! In the end plumped for the wild mushroom shepherds pie - wow! words fail me but I know I will have to go back to try the treacle pudding + CUSTARD
Great bathroom too!
Blimey that's a bloody good portion, I'm a big eater there was no way I could finish it! The batter was crunchy tasty the chips perfect
The Rhubarb crumble was even better than my Mum's a bottle of Ruddles best took me right back home
Very good tender flaky cod with great batter, but the chips were a bit overcooked and thin for my taste, (that's pretty arbitrary; I just prefer thicker chips)
The deep-fried Twinkie was decent, but the highlight was the deep-friend Mars bar
It was AMAZING chocolatey yummy goodness
The decor and ambience were quite nice and very relaxed
The Park Slope location was quaint and pleasant; you'd have to be a trust-fund yuppie to think the area to be scummy
A bit pricey overall, and not somewhere I'd go every week, but overall solid and yum
First impression's go a long way, and when I heard of the Chip Shop in park slope I can only say I was excited
However upon turning up to one of the not so nice parts of park slope I was a little let down, but still never judge a book by it's cover
But as an American who served in the U

The waiter disappeared after dropping off the food so I had no choice but to eat it as is
The restaurant was packed for dinner and the service reflected that
Maybe lunch is better???
I took my b/f there for his birthday and it was sooo amazing
the food the service
we had two guys as our servers and they were so great
the steak perfect, the wine great
just great
best steaks, sides and apps
in town
Total package deal
Great place to have a good time and have alot of fun
The service is outstanding
management (Kenny Tom) make you feel like you are there only customer the minuit you arrive
The bartenders are old line pros, that make serious drinks
When you start to eat there on a regular basis they take the time to remember you table preferences
The waiters even remember what you like and how you like it cooked
They have not lasted this long being second rate
I have eaten at the new Smith and Wollensky in South Beach Miami and loved it so much I thought I would give the original NYC one a try
I have to say I was truly disappointed in the cut of filet mignon I received as it was very fatty which filet should not be at all! My boyfriend's lobster was way overcooked
Also, the waiter was on some other planet during our dining experience
The wine was the only saving grace of the night
If you are going to spend that kind of money I recommend you go to another Steakhouse, or try Wollensky's in Miami (at least the view is nice there)
I've been to many 'elite' steakhouses in NYC
After dining at SW, I can say I will never go back
First of all our waiter was somewhat of a space cadet
He didn't seem to listen and he needed to come back to our table to reiterate the order
Then the food arrived
I have to say that I always get the ribeye wherever I go
This ribeye that I ate was at least 50% fat
It was so nasty that I got ill the next day
Should have i returned it, yes, but I did not want to upset my date
I recently hosted a business luncheon at Smith Wollensky
The atmosphere can definitely be summed up in one word: testosterone
however it was surprisingly not overly obtrusive
The service was excellent
Upon leaving I thought that the prices were a little higher than necessary, however I will say that the cobb salad that I had was made perfectly
I would give Smith Wollensky another try
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOST MEXICAN FOOD, THIS IS THE PLACE
REAL JUST LIKE MEXICO D
F
WOW!!! SERVICE GREAT
NICE AMBIENCE AND FRIENDLY PEOPLE, WE LOVE THE MUSIC AND MY FRIENDS LOVE THE ENCHILADAS DE MOLE, I GO FOR THE HUEVOS RANCHEROS
This is the only real mexican food I have found in the city
The white wine margaritas are amazing, and the food can't be beat
Delicious authentic Mexican
The guacamole was outstanding as was the torta
My friends who love mole sauce say it's excellent here
Friendly quick service, although it can get crowded
A charming finish to the meal are the little chiclettes of gum that they give you with the bill
The food was good and not too expensive
The service was friendly and the atmosphere nice
Great spot! Food was perfect, fish tacos reminded us of San Diego and the Guac was perfect
Chips fried up to order, never seen that in NYC
Good service and cheap prices too
Check it out
The Scene Oversized rainbow-striped banquettes, mid-century-inspired chairs and bright mosaics do justice to the bubbly, urban take on comfort food served up nightly at Elmo
The bar is bustling most nights with visiting diners and Chelsea locals
The Food The menu is one part Mom's table and two parts chic--a recipe that turns out fun interpretations of old favorites
Start with a bowl of alphabet soup with dilled chicken dumplings, or appetizers like fried calamari with tartar sauce or gorgonzola-topped garlic bread
When it comes to entrees, the chef shines with perfectly seared tuna and good old meat and potatoes
And save room for desserts, such as baked-to-order chocolate chip cookies dipped in Mexican hot chocolate, and cheeky Duncan Hines devil's-food cake
I am APPALLED by the service I received at Elmo
We were the only two people sitting out front and the waiter was unable to provide us with attentive service OR our dinner
We both ordered something very simple off the menu we NEVER received it
After 45 minutes, we asked our waiter where our dinner was
like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar, he could barely answer the question and stood there stupified
He provided us with a free appetizer and asked us our order again (he forgot to place the order)
After another half hour, we called it quits
Again, we NEVER received our dinner
We asked for our check (to pay for our drinks and leave), and received the quickest service all evening
Again, I am appalled by the service at Elmo
I DO NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant
Again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant
There are plenty of other restaurants in this city that cater to the guest
Elmo is not one of them
I was entertaining a few guests this weekend who are used to the trendy places with good food/atmosphere, so i decided on Elmo
Great idea!! We were all very pleased with the friendly (and i must mention good looking) staff who didnt think they were too fabulous like in some other chelsea spots, the new menu was delicious, and just the overall vibe was fun
My friends were very satisfied especially since there was great music playing and art hanging(they are in the entertainment biz)
we will all definately be going back there
I have had several great nights at elmo which somehow manages to be super trendy without having the attitude
The food had improved dramatically since it first opened and there a many itmes on the American bistro menu that I actually crave
Sure, it's noisy and the wait for a table can take a while but that's the price you pay in New York for being in the right place
For the price there's no better place for good food and a great scene
A lot of staff walking around, looking around
First, we were seated at a blistering hot table in the back
Then, we were approached by a completely pretentious waiter who cared more about his Chap Stick than his tip
And finally when the food arrived it was wrong, and apparently my fault! Mr
Chap Stick didn't bother to write anything down and when the food came out from the kitchen incorrectly, he had the audacity to tell me that I had ordered what was now in front of me
He never bothered to return after my food came out a second time, nor did he make any apologies for his mistake
He then applied more Chap Stick
Perhaps he was overwhelmed with the 3 tables he had during the lunch rush!
This place is much like its waiters, just eye candy
We were there for Sunday brunch
Ordered the hot home fries but it was nothing but roasted potatoes
We thought the waiter mixed up the order so we sent the potatoes back, but the waiter came back and said that was the spiciest possible, I had a taste and it was still bland like oatmeal! But as consolation we were offered tabasco sauce to remedy the situation
Also when we asked for water refill no one came, but I guess this is just typical
Bottom line is: come here for the drinks, decor and ambience
I'm sure some people will think this is a hip place
But foodies need to stay away

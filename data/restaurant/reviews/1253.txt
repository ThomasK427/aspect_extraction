The service was impeccable -- everyone from the waiter staff down to the demi-servers and bus-men were extraordinarily professional and well mannered! Very attentive, but not intrusive, service
The food
the food was amazing! Everything cooked to perfection and the flavors were neither too subtle nor loud -- just right! I was tempted to make a reservation for a future date as we departed -- word will spread and this will become a NY Hot Spot for a long long time
The Scene Housed in one of the glassy Meier towers, Perry Street takes cues from its modernist home
A small lounge flanks the 60-seat dining room, and at its center sits a lively bar
Banquettes and table seating covered in buttery white leather cradle the glamorous crowd
Swiftly executed service is all smiles
The Food Even after opening treats from the kitchen, diners won't be prepared for the fresh flavors to come
Delicate dumplings burst with brightly peppered crab--their topping of crisp snow peas provide a superb counterpoint
A starter of perfectly seared tuna coated in rice cracker, however, lacks the same spirited vigor
Sauces play a big role, and the divine crispy rabbit--served like an upturned spring roll--benefits from two: one of slow-burn chiles and another of sweet soy beans
A side of cockles in couscous adds a touch of salty brilliance to the orange-pink Arctic char
Desserts follow suit: The chocolate pudding soothes enlightened senses
Perry Street was good from start to finish
It's a beautiful spot with a great view of the sunset on the Hudson River
The restaurant has a very modern feel with a geometric carpet and bare white dishes set with simple silverware and a little bowl of sea salt
The menu is lovely
We went for lunch during restaurant week, which is a great deal
They had wine specials with bottles for $22, which is unheard of in a restaurant of this caliber
The food gets high marks for presentation, but even higher marks for taste
The crispy crab was simply delicious as was the black cod
There were both bold and subtle flavors to the dishes, but nothing was overwhelming
Desserts were really good and the coffee foam on the cappuccino looked painted with expresso melting through it
Service was sublime and I will definitely go back!
I've been to a lot of Jean George's restaurants, and while they're all excellent, Perry St
is probably the best
Everything we had here was excellent - the tuna, steak, and dessert were quite memorable
It's a bit out of the way, but well worth the trek
The place was wonderful and the wait staff very patient
(not most knowledgable, but polite and patient) I had the soft shell crab for appetizer and the lobster entree and both were flavorful, but the accompanying garnish was a tad too heavy on the vinegar
I would have probably added a bit more butter to the lobster ansamble, but overall the evening was wonderful
Didn't try the dessert (my friend did and liked it) but the wine list was good
I think the main thing about the place is still the interior design
Clean and inviting
We started our dinner around 7 pm and by 9 they were packed, but not loud
The restaurant is great for business dinners (you'll definitely impress them) or an intimate dinner for two
They are still young and still lack some of the finess of the more established places, but it's not for the lack of trying
Enjoy your adventure, the place will be around for a while!
Gorgeous
From the charming red-haired door diva, to the sumptuous white leather, and even more sumptuous dishes (hamachi and caviar!), we were given some extra gorgeous
White chocolate makes you want to do things behind closed doors after this
Came here last week with family and had a good time
The food was very good
Try the softshell crab and tuna appetizers
The entrees were beautifully presented and everything tasted good
The service was a little spotty, but it's a new restaurant
The only thing that was questionable was the weird intermezzo they served--what was that? It was like a weird tasting salty cantelope? They may want to rethink that one
Everything about his place is spot on
execptional food with service to match- loved the crab dumplings
It was the only thing I tried as I was not hungy and my date loved his dish - the rabbit
Great time at a great place
the newest and worst of jean georges' places - ambience whiffs of a once-cool spot that has now gone bridge and tunnel
and it hasn't even been open that long
they made a good mojito, but the first bite of food, our appetizer, black pepper crab dumplings were so bad that they rendered my palate useless, seriously, and we had to cut our dinner short and wash our mouths out with soap
Only 6:00 or after 9:30 reservation could be made
I get it, called less than a week before I went
Arrived 6:30 and told I had to finish by 8:30 as the table was rebooked
Food
great amuse followed by interesting sounding apps
Peeky toe dumplings were the best but good thing the crab was great product
The dish was really just crab wrapped in wanton wrappers (I expected better)
Entrees equally disappointing
The filet perfectly cooked and great beef, but boring! The arctic char had fishy odor and halibut, interesting looking, tasted flat (foam = bad)
Caramel is a $9 bowl of diced bananas under a tablespoon of whipped cream and some float thing with donuts resembled neither a float or an edible donut
To add insult to injury, we left at 9:00P and the place was only half full
good thing they told us they rebooked our table
This was my first time to perry; finally my husband did what I asked him to
This place is so sexy and relaxing it was downright arousing
Soft puffs of mozzarella and mango noodles was like sex in a dish
The steak with gruyere was
beyond! My cranky husband had nothing to complain about (for a change), and I made sure when we got home I would inspire future visits to perry by starting our summer lovin early
P
s
Must have lemon thyme drink and white chocoate yuzu thing for dessert
A wonderful sunset greeted my party upon bieng seated,the off white and biege decor brought to mind previous nights in miami,some of the appetizers we enjouyed were the asparagus and poached egg and the dumplings
as for entrees the crnchy rabbit was superb,nicely paired with a siracha paste my patner really enjoyed the lobster also
The service was attentive and pleasant
All in all a wonderfull time was had by all
Always wanted to go to Perry Street
I heard about how hard it was getting a reservation, but I called two days before and got in on a Friday night at 8:30
We were greeted by very welcoming staff
I recommend starting in the chic lounge with some cocktails
The dinner we had was beyond what I expected
The flavors were wonderful
We shared everything from the apps to the desserts
Favorites were the Fresh Mozzarella with Mango and Cilantro, the Butter Poached Lobster, Peruvian Purple Potatoes and an extraordinarilly light airy bernaise was the best lobster I have had
French Toast Dessert with a Hibiscus Ice cream and rhubarb compote was wonderful
The Sommelier also was very helpful guiding us through our vast choices
I am glad we went
Our server also told us that they have brunch dishes on the weekends
Sounds perfect
Will definintely go back soon!
I dont know what these haters are talking about
I go out everynight and have been to perry st
6 times and it is always awesome
The food is simple (think japanese) but explodes in your mouth (think delicious)
The space is airy, sexy and super comfy
Service is great, coktails are delicious, music rocks
the place is just awesome
These haters should go to buddakan or some other cheesy theme restaurant, maybe thats more their speed!!!!

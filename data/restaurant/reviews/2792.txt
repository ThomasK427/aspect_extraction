And if you plan on going to the Queens location try bourbon street right down the block; just as good and 1/2 the price
Went to uncle jack's last night for a romantic dinner
crabcake appetizer was fine
the filet was ordered medium and came CHARRED! Too well done, not enjoyable
Service tried too hard and since there were only 5 or so other tables the wait staff hovered around us constantly
It ruined the evening
I felt for the $$ we spent it was not worth it
9pm on a friday night and it was a dead atmosphere
By far, my favorite steak house (and I have been to them all)! I have eaten at the original in Bayside, Queens and recently at the new location on 9th Ave in the city
The original is still my favorite (more of a personalized feel with the service and food seems to taste a bit better), but both are amazing! Steaks are the best I've had, the creamed spinach is amazing and highly recommended, and the garlic mashed are a must! Also the best crab cakes and huge shrimp cocktail! Can't say anything negative about Uncle Jacks
The best steakhouse by far
one of NYC best kept secrets
Our waiter Brian was superb
couldn't ask for a better
not too pushy and suggestions were fabulous!!! The food was excellent
The surf and turf was magnificent!!! The steak melts in ur mouth
full of flavor and the 25oz Lobster Tail
forget about it
it was excellent as well
The appetizers were awesome especially the Crab cakes
presentation and service wa surplus
what more can I say
EXCELLENT
Reservations a Plus
since it is kinda small less than 20 tables, but room downstairs for private parties
Over 25 Y/O according to the door plaque
We neer heard about this small cozy restaurant in Bayside Queens but we finally went a few months ago and have back almost weekly since then
We have consistantly received great treatment every time we go
It is the best steaks we have ever eaten and all the other food is of the same quality
We will continue to go and tell all our friends
Mmm
steak!! This place makes a mean porterhouse steak
I also had the garlic mashed potato, lobster tails, and crab cakes
They were all VERY GOOD! The service was excellent
The staff was so nice
I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants GREAT food and service
I have had the best steak and seafood HERE
No where else in NY is as good!!PERIOD!And no one gave me a dime to say this
Always consistently good food and service
I have never had a bad meal there
Small and very quaint
The quality of meat is as good or better than Peter Luger's
The seafood is so fresh that you will swear that you were near Fulton Fish Market
The portions are huge
I recommend the porterhouse and the chilean sea bass, split it with someone and enjoy a great but different surf and turf combo
Excellent
Great porterhouse for 2
Excellent desert
Staff is friendly and helpful
A bit pricey for Queens but worth it
I was searching for a good and affordable sushi place in Queens and b/c of the reviews I went to this place
The sushi was tasteless
I could barely find anything in the rolls but rice
Portions are okay but very unsatisfying
I'm not a local to that area but even if I was I would definitely not waste my time going there
I took a chance and went to this place due to a good review and I have to admit that it's as good as they say
The fish was very fresh and the service was very personable
my friends and i love this place! great prices and big portions for sushi
and sushi is fresh
it is a small take-out style restuarant but they have a few tables
so it isn't a fancy romantic place, but great lighting and service is good
Been a lot of Japanese Restaurant
Sushi Nara is one of my favorite
From service to food, no complain!!!! Must try their HAND ROLL!!!
Bayside's version of Cheers - the bartenders are friendly and get to know all the patrons
Good food, better than average pub fare at reasonable Queens prices
Friendly table service, too
Tries too hard to be a club on weekends but otherwise great place
I was introduced to these restaurants as a place to get great burgers
And they were right
If you like good regular food with a comfortable place to eat it check these guys out
The burgers come in a bunch of designs so almost anyone can find one they will attach to
The rest of the menu is done just as well but the burgers are where the action is
Only in NY can you find places like this
Huge menu, fast and friendly service
Breakfast is a great value and they never let you coffee cup run dry
When you walk into Omega you feel like family, whether you're a regular there or trying it for the first time
The restaurant is clean, the food is fresh and a great value, the breakfast is THE best, and the owners are very accomodating in every way
The coffee is consistently great
I love this place
If you are near Bayside or Flushing and do not want to go to Astoria, Laterna is a great restaurant to go (parking in the back)
The food is great and I found it to be fresh and the prices are below to average compared to other Greek Restaurants
There is a small area for eating on regular days and a huge area for special occasions
Outside on the back has an interesting seating area as well, but I prefer inside
If you find the restaurant quiet as I do (I go at odd times and this makes it easier for us because of my energetic toddler), don't worry, they still have fresh food
Try Fillet Mignon slices with cheese (you could ask without the cheese) appettizer
I once went there before the smoke-free laws went into effect, and it was pretty smoky
That's no longer an issue, so you can sit back and enjoy the great food
I went to a wedding shower there recently and I looooved the food
On some days they used to have live music; they still may, but I haven't been there for a few months
Donovan's is a great place to go when you are looking for a low-key place and good old american fare
Their burgers are great and their salads are realloy good too
The atmosphere is nice - it's all dark wood with the bar in the front
the prices are very reasonable
They do not take credit cards so bring cash but it won't hurt the pockets at all
Great burgers and some of the fries I've ever had and the vibe is relaxed and nice
Excellent hamburgers fries
Great fries are made even better w/a side of Ranch dressing
Cash only, so be prepared for that, but prices are really reasonable, so it doesn't hurt too much
Ambiance is nice - traditional dark pub, w/ fireplace in the front room

At this point we needed food and drinks so we checked in and headed down to the restaurant
We sat down for dinner and when our waiter found out it was my friends birthday he quickly came back with glasses of champagne to wish her well
We had a great time
Thank god for the giraffe being sold out I never would have found this place other wise
I was in great anticipation of my visit here, since it was so highly rated and dubbed NY's best kept secret
After my visit, I can't say that this secret isn't worth keeping
Though the lounge area in the front is cute, nothing here is really impressive
In fact, it's borderline average
Even though the food was more seasoned than many other places, my salad, my chicken and my friend's duck were all SALTY! Service was average, decor - average, risotto - average, clam chowder - average
Bottom line - you won't be missing out on anything special if you skip The Black Duck
It's a cozy restaurant, food is good and they make good litchee martinis but as the waiters spend more time chatting with each other than taking orders, it's very hard to get served
Found this amazing new restaurant called the black duck
The food was delicious, I had the wasabi tuna which was the best I ever had in New York
For the entree I had the expresso rub filet which was just to suck your fingers
The atmospher and the service was great, staff was very pleasant
There was such a cute bartender
You have to go and check him out
I think I over heard them call him frankie or something
Just overall great experience
I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone
i went to the black duck after work one night for a drink
the bar was amazing
the underlit marble added a great ambience to the restaurant
the staff was friendly
and the service was great
i loved the live jazz band
it was so great i brought my friends there a week later for dinner
there was about ten of us and we had a great time
the food was awesome
i definately reccommend the Black Duck for drinks and for a lovely dinning experience
This is a beautiful little hotel bar and restaurant
I lived next door and loved to go down for a drink at their uplit marble bar under the beautiful lighting or sit by the fireplace when the live band is not playing
Never eaten dinner there, but plan to soon
Who knew? I stumbled across The Black Duck Wednesday of last week
The menu was a pleasant surprise
I ordered the crab cake appetizer with an amazing apple salad (it was the best crab cake I ever had), my entree was the espresso rubbed fitet mignon
which was cooked perfectly
it was one of the best filets I've had in NYC
The service was friendly and efficient
after dinner my friends and decided to stay for a drink because of the live jazz
We sat on the most comfortable, burgundy velvet couch sipping on Mojitos
I had a great time and I'll definitely go back!!
Took 16 business clients for dinner 03 April
17 people swelled to 20
BD staff quickly accommodated and was pleasant througout
Food was good, but, in the business environment, the service was what really counted
I could tell they rarely had a large party, but they gave it their best and made it a very pleasant evening
I appreciated the extra care and attention -- Great work, guys!
I have walked by this restaurant twice a day for almost a year
It seemed Extremely slow in the begining and now the exact opposite
I went in for the first time this past Saturday w/ four friends
They had about a ten minute wait for a table
When we sat we were greeted immediately
Then came the food the apps were awesome(chinese crab salad)!Three of us had the seared rack of lamb
oh my God! awesome,awesome,awesome
Way to go guys!
I recently visited the Black Duck with a group of 9--and they now have 9 more fans! Among us, we ordered a large sampling of the menu, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal
(Read: clean plate club) The service is extremely friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere gives it that relaxing, neighborhood vibe
Go now
Go often
I hate to rain on the Black Duck parade, but I was not all that overwhelmed
Agreed that the dining room is nice and the tunes are good, but I can only rate the food slightly above average
Had the mushroom salad which was ok, but the asparagus were warm (nice) and the mushrooms freezing (bad)
Then onto the pork chop for me and the duck for my companion
Pork overcooked but flavorful and the duck very fatty
Service was prompt and friendly, but overall, for dishes in the mid-$20s, I'd rather go to an Artisanal or Park Bistro
American Fusion food at it's finest
The chef being a mere 25 years old,has a bright future ahead
Every dish we had was fresh and had outstanding flavors
Young fun staff w/ live music on the weekends
Some favorite dishes(mushroom salad,duck confit,seared tuna,espresso rubbed filet migon)
Went to the Black Duck for my girlfriend's birthday after reading the reviews on Citysearch
I thought the extremely positive rating might have been inflated by overzealous diners, but they are anything but exagerations
While we're not seasoned reviewers, this was the best meal of our lives
In fact, the entire dining experience was outstanding
The Espresso Rubbed Filet Mignon was outstanding
Extremely tasty dish
My girlfriend's fish (sorry I don't remember the name) was in a jalepeno sauce not too sweet or too hot
Fantastic
The Bananas and Fruit Foster took my breath away
Add this to the outstanding atmosphere and very chill live Brazillian jazz (on weekends) and I would not hesitate to recomend this to anyone looking for a wonderful dining experience
Had a wonderful dinner here last night
I had the espresso rubbed fliet mignon and my boyfriend had the most amazing pork chops
The dessert completely lived up to the rest of the meal
They have a very extensive drink list as well as great music and a nice, relaxing atmosphere
Would definitely go back!
If you live in the city,eat at the Black Duck
Simply put everything is Amazing,from the hospitable staff,the live music,and the wonderully presented fresh food
Awesome New York find!!!
I was recently turned on to the Black Duck, for one of thier 5 dollar martinis at happy hour
Last week I decided to sit for dinner w/ a few friends, it was incredible
The Foie Gras was simply to die for
My Girlfriend raved over the burger, while my friend said the halibut was fresh from the boat
The intimate setting and gracious staff made for a perfect evening
Don't miss this spot even if you have to travel!
I paid my second visit to Black Duck last night after a excellent meal several months back
The restaurant didn't let me down
The food is artfully prepared and a wonderful treat for the taste buds
An excellent wine selection complements every bite
The wait staff is attentive, but not obtrusive

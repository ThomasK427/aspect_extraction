I was recommended to go to this restaurant from a freind who couldn't stop raving about how great it was
Unfortunately, my experience was just the opposite
I went for a romantic dinner with my husband and was greatly dissapointed in the bright lighting and very unappealing ambience
The service was frightfully slow
Almost 1 hour before the food arrived, 15 minutes for the dessert, and another 15 minutes just to get the check
It wasn't even very busy!! The food was nothing to brag about, either
I suggest you look elsewhere for dinner out
Since we needed a good meal after working the long hours around citicorp, me my girl decided to get some
At first, the place looked really nice with all the fireplaces and stuff, but i soon found out that i can get lost in there
I am sorry to say that the service sucks here
It took forever to get our food
The waiters kept staring at us
It's like they never saw 2 girls before
We had a craving for sausage but they their special that night was the sole
What was so special? Nothing! it tasted like stinky uncleaned fish
After we finished everything, we got the bill to pay and boy were we surprised! It was worth the nights pay for this stuff we ate: stinky sole, cabbage, veal that tasted like chicken, weak coffee alcohol
if this restaurant makes home-style cooking, then the cooking must have really suck that night! It tasted like food that they had leftover @ home
The service was damn slow! Our dinner started @ 6pm and ended before 10
When we finally got the check, my heart almost stopped! It's a good thing I had the bling-bling that night
Chef Boyardee is better home-cooking than this
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone
I didn't feel welcomed
Horrible service
They were slow and inattentive
The entrees took over an hour and half to come out
The appetizers were hard and stale and the rest of the food was nothing special
I enjoyed Sbarro better than this restaurant
They are unable to hangle a largr party, so much so that there was a minimum of a 45 minute wait in between the appetizers and entrees being served
The staff were extremely rude and impolite
Not to mention the food was not worth the trip
Will never go back!
This is a short cab ride over the 59thst bridge
While it is off the island, it is actually fairly convenient and only takes a few minutes from midtown
Even if the trip were longer this place is worth it
The homey ambience is extremely warm, inviting and comfortable
This is a place to relax and enjoy
Unlike the sloppy red gravy cliches of Arthur Avenue, the food is excellent
This is traditional, well executed foods and you have probably eaten inferior versions of many dishes countless times
Eggplant is expertly fried
The gnocchi, a dish that ranges from rubbery to fluffy pillows by chefs who mistakenly view that as a virtue, are here rendered, plump, firm and soulful
The winelist is extremely strong and deep in Italian vintages back through the 1970s
The selection of French wine is also top-notch (though not yet listed)
The Scene  It's a trip, and we're not talking about the trek from the subway
For the past 20 years, this former 19th-century hotel has hosted uninhibited, raucous fun unlike any you'll find in Manhattan
Locals frequent the wood-paneled bar--a high-ceilinged, smoke-clogged room decorated with boxing gloves, celeb photos and a peanut-filled bathtub
Bibbed diners pound Old Bay crabs with wooden mallets in a maze of small dining rooms, where bordello lamps, old subway signs and vintage baby carriages hang closely overhead
The Food Leave your gourmet palates at home, but bring your appetite
This "fish-house-known-for-its-steak" specializes in abundance, with an Italian accent
Start with bready baked clams oreganata or briny littlenecks before diving into "bouillabaisse our way," a spicy tangle of mussels, shrimp, squid and crab linguine topped with a whole lobster
Not-so-flavorful, but reasonably priced porterhouse, served pan-fried with fries, benefits from the house steak sauce
I'm a local, and love coming to this place for some soft shell crabs with garlic butter sauce and old bay seasoning (on the side)
While you wait for the crabs, there's a bath full of peanuts which keep you somewhat entertained and hunger at bay as you smell all the delicious food that people are being served
Once the crabs arrived, it sure took time to plow through the oh so reasonably priced and oversized portion, but well worth the effort and the service was great! Don't forget to dip the herb crusted bread sticks that they give you in the seasoning - yum! The easiest way to get there if you're coming from Manhattan is to take the Water Taxi from 34th Street, just a few steps away from the Crabhouse! Or if you have a good sense of direction, the 7 train is pretty close too
Makes a great day out as once you're finished dining on crabs what better way to spend the rest of the afternoon/evening than having a few beers at the Water Taxi Beach - a totally hidden treasure!
Unlike the poor experience of a previous reviewer, my experience was exceptional
I didn't have reservation, so the wait was an hour for six of us, but it was well worth the wait
The blue claw maryland style crabs were fresh and delicious!! I asked the server if they ever run out of crabs and she expained that they come in fresh daily becasue they don't like to order too many so they are always fresh and that was why they sometimes run out quickly!!!The service was friendly and funny and the music was an entertaining jazzy blues band!! The hostess suggested to us making reservations on the weekend as it gets very crowded and the wait can be up to 2 hours without one
I'll know better for next time! As if the delicious crabs weren't enough, the waterfront crabhouse serves the best prime rib i ever tasted!!! It was double-cut (about 2inches thick) and melted in my mouth
My friends and I each had assorted meat and seafood entrees, none of which were disappointing
They have a variety of desserts from apple cobbler to chocolate mousse but i would suggest the chaos cake, a layer of chocolate brownie, a layer of cheesecake and topped with chocolate mousse
What a way to end a meal!! The drinks at the restaurant were the cheapest around
Glasses of wine were around $5
00, mixed drinks around the same, and my cosmo was around $6
00
No bar around the area has been serving drinks that cheap for years!!! If you're looking for a hoity toity place to eat - this isn't the place for you! But if you want a fun easy going staff with reasonable prices and the most unique decor ever, then try it out! It's well worth the trip!
As mentioned by a previous reviewer, this crab house seems to specialize in not having crabs
From an order of 2 crab entrees, our table received a total of ZERO
To make matters worse, we weren't notified about the lack of crabs until ~1 hour after we ordered
So, one person at our table was left without any entree to speak of while 4 others had their non-crab entrees served
To make up for this grievous and uncomfortable error, the bumbling co-manager tried to assuage us by offering some free drinks or desserts, none of which we wanted
Then she inexplicably had a mental breakdown of sorts while she proceeded to blame the cook, the owner, and the holy spirit for all the troubles related to our crab mix-up
I kept looking around for a hidden camera because I thought her dramatic display was for candid camera or some audition for Days of Our Lives
If the other non-crab entrees were spectacular, then I might forgive the poor service and incompetent managerial staff
but alas, the entrees that succesfully made it to our table were sub-par at best
I cannot recommend anything positive about this restaurant, except that it IS near the waterfront so a suicidal jump into the water (after a frustrating dinner) only requires a very short walk
No better way to kick back and have a relaxing non-snobby dinner
Everything on the menue is good and the staff is so personable you feel like you've been coming for years
Went with my ladyfriend last night, and we both had a great time
Full carafe of house white was delicious and cheap ($12)
Loved the Maryland-style blue crabs! The price for sharing mussels to start, wine, two orders of crabs, and cheesecake and coffee was under $90
As for ambience, the place has a lot of Queens and boxing memorabilia and has a generally good feel to it
Also, there was music to aid the digestion; they had a guy singing Frank Sinatra, Rod Stewart, and Barry White tunes
I was very impressed with the food and the people are great
This is a great place to spend a weekend afternoon
I liked this place so much the first time, the short trip across this river is totally worth it
We venture back nearly every week - a great change from the Manhattan scene!
The king crab legs are excellent! A very good value
There was a man singing and playing the keyboard who was very good
A few couples even got up for a dance, which made it a fun atmosphere
The fried calamari is very tender and fresh
The drink prices are the most reasonable in town! They even have house wine by the carafe for $12!!
Finally had a chance to eat at the historical crabhouse
But guess what??? they had no crabs
So, we eat fried fish, hamburgers and steak
All below average
Many locals, who have been there since the 1800's , drink at the bar
They have alot of memorobilia from a long time ago
I guess the food was good back then
The Waterfront Crabhouse has been an establishment hidden in Queens for over 27 years
If you love seafood, then you will love this place

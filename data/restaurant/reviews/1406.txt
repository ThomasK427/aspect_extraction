Their ingredients are fresh
Grilled to perfection
other japanese cooked foods are excellent as well
The decor is lacking, but its just good enough
Most people inside are Japanese, so thats gotta tell you something
Its really the best Yakitori in NY by far!  The only downside is that theres usually a long wait and you cant make a reservation after 7pm
I went Tuesday night with a group for my best friend's birthday
We had a reservation and were sat right away
I have nothing bad to say about this place
the white sangria was fantastic, we loved all of the tapas that we ordered and desert was out of this world! Definitely try the cheesecake and pan de chocolate
There is a fun, trendy but non-pretentious atmosphere
The service was friendly and prompt
Will definitely be back
This was one of the best places I have been to
I ordered the short ribs and they were great, fell of the bone just looking at them
The wait was not very long and the staff was great
BRGuest does it again
Good food, great service and nice decor
Sangria is yummy
Must try to tapas: spicy potatos are awesome
My bf I went to dinner on a Friday night-service couldn't be better
I ordered the red sangria-it was great got me wasted-esp liked the orange granita
But then the food started to come we changed our tune
Got the Spanish omelette to start-bland and a little dry although I did like the little salad that came with it
I went balls out and ordered the Kobe beef was SO disappointed
It smelled awful had a flimsy consistency was heavily covered in peppercorns
If McDonalds served steak this is what it would taste like
My boyfriend got the paella-fine but nothing special the chicken was dry and tasteless-how can you mess up chicken? We had fun were drunk but it was definitley not worth the $109 bill
Loved it
Went here last Friday night with my boyfriend
We had a reservation and showed up a little early and they sat us right away
The place was busy, but not overly crowded
The waiter was fantastic - attentive, friendly, and was on top of everything
We had some tapas, and split an entree
Tapas- calamarie- great
Shrimp in lemon/lime sauce - great
Beef empanadas - ok
THey had a strong Indian spice taste, which I don't like, but my BF loved them
We shared the seafood paella, which was fantastic
And then we recieved complimentary champagne as dessert! And the decor is very cool
A fantastic new place, sure to do well for years to come
I've been here 3 times in the past 2 months and have enjoyed it more each time
Although cocktails are pricey--about $11--they're strong
Tapas are served hot and generously (I recommend beef empanadas, superfresh fried calamari), and the paella--which is served on a startlingly large platter with enough clams, mussels, shrimp, and chicken to serve 2 more people than it says on the menu
And this was the basic paella (they have 2 other more deluxe dishes, including one w/ lobster)
Waitstaff is attentive but not overly so
It's easy to fill up on tapas--keep it in mind if ordering entrees here
I had a reservation at Barca 18 and showed up about 15 minutes early - checked in and sat at the bar, by the time my date arrived I had just ordered a glass of wine so we thought we would finish our drinks and then get seated since I had checked in so early and the place wasn't packed - it didn't seem like a big deal
When I went back to the hostess (yes it was past the time we had for our original reservation) - she said that it was fine to get seated but we needed to leave in an hour
If we were in danger of losing our reservation couldn't she have told me since she knew I was at the bar AND considering she knew we checked in? Also - she should have seated us w/out the hour disclaimer OR said we missed out
food are excellent
I would recommend the black rice (made with squid ink)
The soup is a bit salty but managable
service is up to par
The food is great
The servers were very well informed, knew exactly which wine I wanted to order when I asked for a priorato
The servers are more of the Le Bernardin than the Blue Water Grill ilk
The bacalao pizza was excellent, as was the lobster paella
Generally reasonable prices for the quality of the food and the ambiance
The sangria hit the spot, too
Simple, pleasing and tasty delights abound
The monkfish was perfect in texture and is a reason why I will come back
Being a big fan of the calamari at USC, I figured I would try a different calmari offering here
I was more than pleased with this perfectly cooked offering
Wine list is very extensive
Very cool social scene also on Wed/Thurs nights
i had a selection of tapas and wine at the bar
the bartender was not familiar with their wine list
the tapas ranged from bad to all right
they have half of their impressively long bar closed off, robbing the place of a real spanish bar scene
sala on bowery is far superior and not as expensive
The food didn't resemble the tapas that I had in Barcelona and although it didn't transport us back to Espana, we had an enjoyable evening
We particularly liked the Bacaloa Coca and Calamari
The wine list is predominantly Spanish although there is a nice selection of domestic wines
Will be back
With feverish aniticipation, I ventured to Barca (pronounced Bartha) 18 on Oct
26th
I must say, despite a few shortfalls, the overall experience was excellent
I started off with a, recommended, glass of makers mark and FIG at the bar to galvanize my appetite
The syrupy beve was way too sweet, so I ditched half the mug at the bar
Onward: We immediately ordered the Calamari and the Tuna Escabeche
The Calamari was PERFECT! Not the rubbery trash you get at Houstons
The presentation of the Tuna (in a tin can) was Awesome, however, it was slightly over oiled
We ordered the monkfish and Halibut with rosemary and thyme
The monkfish was bold, with thin slices of smokey chorizo and tomatoes gently layed on top
Matched like a pea in a pod with my tempranillo
The halibut was simple, yet elegant
We crammed in the churros (hot fried donuts)--Awsome
Laid-back ambience, great food, excellent wine list, good service, nice vibe--a rarity in NYC
great menu, extensive wine list 50 wines by the glass
Jour Et Nuit has the best Moroccan food
Their couscous and tagines are splendid
I would recommended the Combination Supreme salad for starters to share with friends
And then for an entree with lamb or seafood, or if your vegetarian, the couscous
All are really great
Then end the meal with some Moroccan tea
What I like so much about the restaurant is that its really earthy
The decor is great with really beautiful tile work floors and tables
The chefs/owners were really nice and even garaunteed their food to be the best
You feel like your in Morocco where everyone knows everyone and the food just makes the atmosphere great

But we saw there was a long long line when we visited the Little Italy at night
so better make your reservation when you plan to have dinner at the normal hour
Hint: make a request for one of the three tables in the kitchen
Watching the coal oven in action is half the experience!
Amazing pizza, the best I had so far ! I've been there with a friend last year and I will definitly come back next time I'm in New York
I have to agree with everyone else this is the best pizza i've had so far
the wait is about 30-45 min
the servers aren't the best but the pizza is worth going through all of it
I definitely will be back whenever friends come to visit
And they've renovated so there's more seating
absolutely the best pizza I have ever tasted! I love it so much, I had to bring two pies back to L
A
!! a must for the pizza lover
This pizza is awesome
There wouldn't be lines a mile long with locals if the pizza wasn't excellent
The crust was a bit salty but during a 4 day stay in the city, we ate there 3 times! Highly recommend!!
The best pizza I've ever had! We ate on the roof and it was great
I loved the atmosphere and the fact that we were treated like family
More than worth the trip in from NJ
We always bring out of state guests to Lombardi's
If this is what New Yorkers consider GOOD brick oven pizza, they've lost their taste buds
Soggy uneven crust, tomato sauce with no flavor and average mozzarella
What a disappointment
Wow, New York is making me so fat!!! Another great meal, and this time the best pizza I've ever tasted
Two of us arrived at 9:30 and seated straightaway
We shared a medium pizza and it was HUGE! Unfortunately, we were going out to bars after so we couldn't take away what we didn't finish
Only thing is they don't serve desserts
Guess no one's ever made it that far with their appetites! Decor is laid-back, lots of brick and stone
Prices are reasonable
Go there for the famous pizza and enjoy
We went to Lombardi's the day after Thanksgiving at about 2:15 pm and had to wait 45 minutes for a table
There is a bar area but we just waited by the door, watching the multitudes of people come in to ask for a table
Finally we were seated and ordered a small pie, half cheese/half pepperoni
We were not disappointed
The sauce was perfect, not bland or too sweet
I also liked the proportion of cheese
They put a shaker of garlic powder on the table (good idea), although fresh garlic is free
I would rate this as the best pizza in NY!
A groupd of teens from a church I used to attend went there for a mission trip and we dined at lombardi's
We all enjoyed it and I did more than anythign b/c I love pizza! It was the best pizza I had ever put in my mouth and to this day still is
Apparently this is listed twice or something because the address I had showed it on a different street
Took awhile to find by asking NYers, but definately worth the hassle
The pizza was nothing like any chain pizza! Crunchy, thin crust with huge (fresh) toppings
We got a pitcher of sangria too, and it was $37! No ice in it so it lasted a long, long time
I would highly recommend you stop here if you plan a trip to NY! The staff were very friendly and service was prompt
When I sat down with my 5 and 9-year old children, the waitress suggested that she put the basil on the side because many times children do not enjoy the taste
I thought it was very considerate of the witress to think of that
The service was excellent
The three of us enjoyed the pizza, as it was a pleasant departure from the plain ordinary pizza in the New Jersey surburbs!!!
Well, I was taken there again by some friends who read about it here at Citysearch
I tried to convince them otherwise but
Anyway, same story: - Very bad service (rude also this time) - Pizza with black stains - Cold appetizers  Price ?? so and so
it should be lower considering the quality
Later, Jas
The hostess was very rude and yelled at us, claiming that she had been calling our party for along time and oh tisk why hadn't we answered her? The pizza did not have a smoky yet bitter delightful flavor
Rather, it had bits of charcoal still attached to the crust which made it taste very bitter and was inedible at best
It was inexpensive though but with all of the rest said
who cares?
Lombardi's on Spring Street recently expanded to offer even more seating, which translates into less waiting for a taste of the best pizza I've ever had
The complex flavors of the oh-so fresh toppings nestled on a savory layer of tomato sauce coupled with the crispy thin crust make for the peak pizza experience
Have the people who say Lombardi's is the best NY pizza actually eaten there? I was so excited to try it, having been a totonno's addict for many years
Not only is is not as good -- it's not even close
Both have great crust, though Totonno's is a little lighter and thinner
The sauce at Lombardi's was more acidic, but the biggest difference was the cheese
At Totonno's it has some tang to it, with a little bit of baked parmesan on top
Lombardi's fresh mozzarella was bland, flavorless
Toppings-wise, Lombardi's garlic meatballs were terrible, sliced too thick and overdone
Beyond that, the menu at totonno's is amazing, great salads, egglant parm, penne vodka
Lombardi's salad dressing is so heavy on the vinegar it brings tears to your eyes
Lombardi's doesn't hold a candle to totonno's and has rested on its laurels for too long
I'm a pizza snob and this is the only place I'll eat pizza
I've turned all my friends into die hard Lombardi's patrons as well
We waited in line one day after picking up my wedding dress for 45 minutes - THATS how good it is! They also have yummy sides, but I try not to fill up sides and salads - the Pizza's where its at! Pizza in about 5 minutes - how good is that
Just had pizza here Saturday 08/07/04
No lines when we arrived at noon, we were seated promptly
It took 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order
One regular and one clam pie
Well we never got the clam pie or an offer for a second round of drinks
Only after a busboy tried to clear our plates did the missed order become evident
They did offer to make it, but we were a bit ticked by then
The place was not crowded, but the entire staff seemed harried
Pizza was excellent though, but probably not worth the bother, as there are dozens of places in the city with pizza as good and decent service
I guess this is your quinnesential New York pizza
Thin burned crust, average toppings, but good fresh mozzerella cheese
If you want to try a classic New York pie, head elsewhere because there's really no difference between one place and the next
Since this one is old and is hyped the line outside is no indicative to a quality meal
I'd rather spend my time on an airplane to Chicago to grab a real slice of deep dish pie
To quote the guy standing behind us in line, it's worth the wait
Excellent ingredients superbly cooked
Try the plain cheese pizza to see how good three or four simple ingredients can taste
And if you like seafood, order the clam pie: clams, garlic, olive oil, and a dusting of cheese--that's all
The best pizza I have ever eaten in my life
I ordered the pizza (delivery) from this place and I was surprised at how good the pizza was
Its not the typical greasy, oily tomato sauce pizza that youll get off the streets from those pizzeria for 2 slices for a dollar
Its got this traditional old school authentic taste to it
Also, it tastes best without any toppings
So yeah, definitely order this out for house parties etc
Went on a Saturday afternoon and got right in
Place is small but very comfortable and homey
Even thought the place wasn't packed it took a long time for the server to come

Pad thai and a variety of noodle soups, such as pho bac and Bangkok Curry, round out the menu and arrive in heaping portions
Great Food
Rock'n Cocktail List (be sure to go M-F 5:30 - 7:30 double your pleasure with happy hour 2 for 1) have the blueberry mojito or the coconut martini
Hot freindly staff
Fun night crowd or sneak in during the dy for something quick
I love it here
Loved the Malaysian Curry Noodles and the Small Plate Combo
Food was good and relatively quick
A little pricey and our waiter was definitely not impressed with us (I guess we just weren't cool enough for him)
They let us hang out for a long time after our meal was done, which was nice
I would go back, but I wouldn't expect to be treated like family
As a Londoner whose family have all immigrated to the city, Kelley Ping is the first place I visit for lunch whenever I return to NYC
It is a gem, and reminiscent of Thailand's Street Stalls - only more civilised
The food is of the same standard
If you want a quick, cheap and delicious lunch - as well as healthy
come to Kelley Ping
nice place - food not awsome - but a cool place to go
The Dak Bulgogi (Korean Grilled Chicken) was great, and most of the items on the menu were very savory @ inexpensive prices
(not the pad thai though) The drink list was comprehensive (including cocktails, margarita, and sakes) and I highly recommend the Strawberry and Pineapple cocktail plus the last sake on the list
The decor was not extravagant but rather authenticly cozy and intimate
Good for large groups as well as romantic dates
Even people who don't like Asian food will love this restaurant
Ther is not one thing I have tried that is less than excellent on this menu
I've been going to Kelley and Ping for years
The lemongrass chicken is incredible
The prices haven't changed much, neither has the large space, and I keep coming back again and again
This place is quite a setting
The food is delicious and not too complicated; it's yummy for the whole family
The decor and environment is very inviting and homey
Can't go wrong at this place
Whenever I am close to Kelley and Ping, I make a point of stopping by for some of the best asian food in the city
The quaint atmosphere and the uncommonly friendly floor staff, make lunch a great experience aside from the food, which is the reason to come to Kelley and Ping in the first place
Soup, salad or an asian wrap, all of the food is just great
One of my favorites is the scallion pancakes, not really a big scallion taste, but a sort of pita bread fried and served with a dipping sauce; very nice
I feel like I can eat here everyday, if only I can be in the area
Anyway, Kelley and Ping is the best bet for a great lunch anywhere in SoHo
Kelley and Ping has alot of different food to offer
I work in the area and for the summer I've been eating their new Asian wraps and this grilled shrimp salad, but today (after telling my co-workers about the low-carb meals) I ordered a bowl of soup
The soup was so delicious, huge I couldn't even finish it
I was so happy and satisfied afterwards
It is nice to know I can eat low carb, but I am glad that I can get my noodle fix at Kelley and Ping
Kelley and Ping taught me that I like Asian food
At Kelley and Ping they have alot of different dishes I guess from all over the place in Asia
Our waitress was saying some is from Vietnam and Korea, I had never had this food; Our waitress was a big help
I had this Beef dish from Korea and my date had a dish from Thailand, I think it is great a place like Kelley and Ping exists where you can have a little of everything from just about everywhere
I am definetly lookin forward to coming back to Kelley and Ping
Dining at Kelley and Ping has always provided a consistent high quality of food, but last night I had a new entree that made my old favorite feel like a new friend
The salad had grilled jumbo shrimp and avocados with red onions and a great variety of greens like watercress
The salad was the perfect counter balance to my Seafood Keemow which is a huge bowl of noodles with all sorts of seafood and peppers
I loved it last night, but only after eating the leftovers today am I inspired to take a brake from work to right about how much I love this food, I love this restaurant
Kelley and Ping has delicious old favorites and can surprise me with yummy new dishes
I kid you not, I am on my honeymoon and I have eaten here with my new wife, four of the last five days
This place is like two restaurants in one
During the day you go to the counter and order
I have been having the 'wraps' with beef, spicy cabbage and lettuce, or this other one that has shrimp and a dipping sauce
My new wife and I usually split one of the amazingly delicious soups that have a sea of broth and miles of noodles
But at night, the place changes, and it is sit down service
The staff is brilliant, fun and professional and the menu gets a little more entree and less soup oriented
The steak is great, the stripped bass steamed in a banana leaf is even better
We need a Kelley and Ping in England
I had a nice light meal, perfect for the summer when I was at Kelley and Ping
I used to think of Kelley and Ping as a cool weather place to eat, what with its hearty curry soup and huge portions
But my lunch was very light with a wrap, not tortilla, but something thinner, a rice paper sort of crepe, that had lettuce and spicy cabbage and thin sliced beef
Also, they had this tasty pink lemonade that was both cool and refreshing
The hearty soups are still there and delicious, my friend had the duck broth soup with miles of noodles and vegetables to spare
I am happy the place I knew has a cool weather dining spot can change with the seasons
For me kelley and ping is delicious year around
I had the most lovely dining expereince at Kelley and Ping this weekend
I had a grilled beef salad, that had mint and red onion
Had my entree not been so delicious, this would have been the high point
I saved all of my carbs for this wonderful yellow curry soup with chicken in every spoonful, and delicious noodles
This place is simply devine with its minimalist look, I actually felt like I good have been in a noodle market in some Asian country
Also, having the kitchen exposed for our view it was like watching theater, with our meals as the attraction
Great food and beautiful atomosphere, these are some of the reasons Kelley and Ping is a great place to sit and eat
I live overseas and when my friends come to New York, I always tell them to come here
Everyone Loves Kelley and Ping
Business takes me to New York often and everytime I make the trip downtown to this place
This week a nice warm curry soup with noodles (you can pick your own) for rainy days, and today I had a salad with grilled rolled beef
This restaurant is the perfect for all occasions
The menu is diverse enough to fit every appetite and every taste bud
I cross an ocean to come to Kelley and Ping for the Pad Thai
I am happy to dine at Kelley and Ping
The food is great, I love the roasted duck in a penang curry sauce, with sauteed greens
Delcious, crispy and rich
As an appitizer, I started with the grilled beef salad, which has an amazing combination of mint and red onion and enough grilled beef to get some meat in every bite of this fresh green salad
Also, I had a great cocktail, with pomegranate and tequilla
What was great about this place? The fact that I had a great meal, in SoHo, where the place looked beautiful and the price was cheap
Kelley and Ping has character, great staff and delicious food, all at a price that makes SoHo affordable
I read the last review about the parents and the whole 'kids eat free' thing and I thought my night would be over run with kids, it wasn't, instead the restaurant held a very diversified SoHo crowd in it ground floor loft siz space
The nice airy openness of the restaurant is soothing, the dark lighting, conforting, but all contrasted with action from the kitchen where we can see them cooking our food
Was that our dish with the huge flames coming from the wok? Doubt it, the pad thai was delicious and the Korean Beef (tons of it) came with Kimchi, which is among the best kimchi I have ever had
Even though they have tons of great teas, I prefer the sweet delight of the 'vietnamese coffee' they are great!
Kelley and Ping rocks - it is the perfect all around restaurant for all sort of people
Working in the area, I always get my usual lunch of noodles or soup - consistently great, but then I had a lunch special of pork chops
Delicious! You get served a pile of pork chops grill cooked and marinated and topped with a great sauce
It comes with sticky rice
This was a great lunch meal and for under ten bucks in SoHo
What a bargain
Then, I went after work, I did not know, it has a complete different menu at night as well as table service, instead of the cafeteria style during the day
And on the new dinner menu, pork chops

we were able to enjoy ourselves
Friends threw my birthday party here and the owner and waitstaff could'nt have been nicer
We were given souviners and a poloroid picture of our group
Margarita pitchers were heavenly, great chili too
Thanks Trailer Park Lounge
Loved the food, it's not fancy, just good
Menu is short and to the point
Sweet potato fries are heavenly
We'll be back
I loved this place, the food was great and the drinks were potent
The staff was as friendly as they come
It was my friends birthday and the owner gave her a Trailer Park t-shirt and a Moon Pie with a candle in it, it was so cute
We had a great time!
We had a group of five folks
The place was empty
Service was bad enough that we decided to head out after the first round of drinks
When we got our check, the waitress had added a 20% gratuity for a large party! We took it up with the manager who told us that it was in fact their policy to add a 20% tip to parties of five or more
First of all, no restaurant I know considers FIVE people to be a large party
Secondly, no restaurant I know has the audacity to charge a 20% gratuity for a party
Industry standard is 16-18%
We pleaded our case with the management and got nowhere
Our large party will not be returning
Good burgers, good sweet potato fries, good drinks, good atmosphere, good music, good service, I guess I liked this place
I'm just a regular Joe, went here to hang out and enjoy myself
Got some grub and drinks and really dug this place
No pretense, no nonense, just a cool joint
This is my new favorite place
Went here on a recommendation and had a really good time
We had burgers, very good, and strawberry margaritas, great atmosphere, I would recommend
Nice staff
good food for cheap prices- limited to trailer food: hot dogs, hamburgers
Such cute decor and a great place for birthdays and bachelorettes
The only problem we had was with an incompetent waitress and floor manager which slowed down our food and seating
I would still reccomend it though
It's one of the cutest bars in NYC
A friend mentioned this place and said that I should try it, I did and liked it
Our B
L
T
and mac + cheese were very good
The drinks were a little to strong for me but my husband liked his and ordered another one
Our waitress was a sweetheart, I think her name was Denise
You are better of going early in the week, it gets just a little crowded on Friday
Been a few times over past few months - always busy and fun - people are social and the bartending staff are responsive
Always good to meet or stop for a drink
Had brunch with a couple of strong bloody mary's here last sunday
They had this old Delta blues guy playin' guitar and singin', felt like I was back in Mississippi
Good food, strong drinks, good live blues
Trailer Park is hilarious
Walked by this place last week and looked at all the people having a good time, thought we would check it out right then
Had a few cold reingolds and split a b
l
t
, well that hit the spot big time
Loved the decor, too much to look at in a single visit, funny, funny stuff
Going to have my sisters birthday party here
This place is the best place I ever partied at in New York City
My friends and I had a blast from the past and wanted it to last
Great food, drinks, decor,and music
We will be back soon
Trailer Park is a place where one can venture to experience those nostalgic relics that we are all too familiar with
I highly recommend the Vegetarian burger which is quite tasty
Even more tasty are the mouth watering sweeet potato fries
I suggest ordering an extra basket because you will want more or if your company did not order any, they will probably eat yours! For drinks, try the tropical mixed drink poured directly into an entire cut-out pineapple topped off with cheesy pins
And as you eat, you can get a kick out of the cheesy pop culture items surrounding you
Don't forget to check out the music on the jukebox
It matches the entire decor as far as cheeze is concerned! Go for fun, laughter, birthdays
It's for anytime, any age
Check it out! The waitresses are the only thing that is not cheesy; their service is superb!
Went here late on a thursday afternoon and sat upfront in the bowling alley area
We just ordered margarita's and hung out
Great place to people watch
Try the Turkey Chili and the Sweet Potato Fries, they are excellent
Ask for the waitress named Johanna, she's so nice
What a nice change from the usual generic bar thats out there
This place is a funny kitschy down home joint with GREAT HAMBURGERS and GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICHES
I have no clue what that person was on about in that review after mine, but my margaritas were just great (and potent), it sounds like some kind of sour grapes, this place was a whole lotta fun
Do yourself a favor and try the Trailer Park burgers, they are very good, The menu is short but right to the point, sweet potato fries are dynamite! Great Atmosphere
Great atmosphere, my friends bachelorette party was a hit, staff and drinks were great, owner bought our whole table a round of tequila shots
We'll be back

i LOVE THE WAIT STAFF REALLY CUTE GIRLS, VERY FRIENDLY, THE BARTENDERS MAKE GREAT STRONG DRINKS!!! I LOVE THE PLACE!!!!
Fun place to come with friends, good food and strong margaritas
Nice staff
THE TURKEY CHILI IS DIVINE WITH AN ICY COLD PABST BLUE RIBBON IN A CAN
NANCY SINATRA AND PEGGY LEE ON THE (REAL VINYL) JUKEBOX AND MORE COOL CRAP ON THE WALLS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE SO I CAN KEEP THIS PLACE ALL TO MYSELF
Trailer Park is hilarious
The walls are covered in the best garage sale rejects ever
Tonya Harding, Tammy Faye Baker, Elvis impersonators, you can not possibly take it all in by one visit
The grilled turkey burger and sweet potato fries are among the best i've ever had
A drink called the Paradise Hawaiian Style comes in a real pineapple and it rocks
Great mix of people, music and atmosphere
I'll be back!
A friend recommened TRAILER PARK for my birthday party, it was alot of fun
The staff was great and the drinks were dynamite
One of the owners even went out and bought our whole table krispy kreme donuts and put birthday candles in each one
Thank you TRAILER PARK for a great birthday
i THINK THAT THE FOOD AND DRINKS KICK ASS!!! THE STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY!!! GO SPEND YOUR MONEY!!! ITS WORTH THE BUZZ!!!

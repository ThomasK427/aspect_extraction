It's very busy by 10 am and pretty much stays that way till about 2pm
Their baked eggs are amazing, and so are the panni sandwiches
Great lattes, and espressos
The bad part is that the windows are opening when it's nice outside and their outside seating houses smokers by the dozen
If the wind is strong the smell comes right in
Avoid sitting next to the outside seating area
all of their chocolates seem to be made w/the flavor of hazelnut or praline, which i hate
I stick to the fruit tarts, but my b/f loves it
In the evening it's great for a night cap
This was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had! The baked egg dishes are so tasty and filling, and very unique
The taste and prices are perfect for everyone
My only gripe is I wish the tables were bigger to accomodate all the food and drinks
Enjoy!
Lots of daylight, perfect croissants, other baked goods, granola, small salads and light lunches
Everything is beautifully made and the prices, while higher than those at the local delis, are appropriate for the higher quality ingredients used
And they don't mind you sitting at a table drinking your coffee slowly with your laptop in front of you
I've been searching for a great Vietnamese restaurant ever since I moved to Brooklyn
I was delighted with Pho Tay Ho
The food was prepared fresh and came to the table within a few minutes
My group of 4, who were new to Vietnamese food, loved it
Best of all, with appetizers, the bill for the four of us, came to $30
Hard to beat in NYC
If you're looking for a simple, family-style, restaurant, with great Vietnamese food at a great price--this is it!
I had dinner with 5 family members today
However, they only brought out 3 bowls, and out of the 6 plates they gave us, 4 were dirty, and they didn't set the table for us either
They just left the plates in a pile
We ordered food which came out quickly
But, when the soup came out, the waiter just left it next to someone, and didn't put it in the center of the table like he's supposed to, since it was soup for the whole table
When we were finished with some dishes, they did not clear the table for us
We had to ask them to clear the table of the dirty dishes
The food was all right, but other Vietnamese restaurants are better
I was shocked too because there was a NY Times article on the wall about the restaurant
The service definitely ruined the experience
This little bakery/cafe is nice for grabbing a croissant and coffee before starting your day
The iced coffee is made w/ care
blended ice makes for a nice touch
They have a mound of desserts and one of the best baguettes around
With choices of sourdough, whole wheat, and white
if you don't go early in the day, you'll be left with a slim choice
The Parisian sandwich is also worth a taste
One can run on former reputation as Jackie O's baker for so long
The service is slow and flat -- hey, how about being friendly from time to time? The baked goods are pretty good if not overcooked
They would do well to clean up the place, organize the merchandise and hire staff that are a
friendly and b
willing to work at a pace faster than a geriatric lady using a walker
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much
They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert! They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura
The appetizers are also delicious! Highly recommended!
Aside from Sushi Yasuda in Manhattan, this is arguably the best sushi I've ever had (and some of the most innovative)
Fantastic bang for the buck, great atmosphere and consistently quality service
The Mexican Roll, White River Roll and Millenium rolls are musts
This is one of my favorite places in the city
Delicious
Try the White River Roll - unbeliveable
I love this place
Their sushi is delicious!  I highly recommend the valentine roll which is delicious or the osaka roll
I go to this place usually once a week and I have been there tons
there has been only one or two times when I thought the sushi was below par ( i guess everyone has their off nights)- when that was the case I did not order for a while
But then I would go back and it would be delish! Their menu has just been updated featuring new rolls and more choices
If you're in Park Slope I would go to this sushi place above all the others!
The place is cute -- small, cozy with a cute garden, BUT the food is not comprable to its look
This place doesn't even make their own veggie dumplings nor can they tell you what's in them! The sea bass was drowning in ponzu sauce --way too much! The sushi rolls weren't too bad
I would recommend going for the ambience only -- maybe a cup of tea and a scoop of ice cream
I've ordered deliveries from them several times, and was always disappointed
I once complained, and they gave me a free order, which was nice of them but that sucked too
They seem like nice folks, but the food is bad to average
I wrote them off and never order from them again
Jack's is an amazing local restaurant that has friendly staff and awesome food for very reasonable prices
Everything on their menu is great, whether it's brunch, lunch or dinner! They also feature live bluegrass music on Friday and Sunday nights which is really fun and a great Brooklyn thing to do
Jack's Fifth Avenue is a real easy-going place, which is great for kids, families, couples, singles or anyone! They also deliver which is great for a cheap, quick, and delicious meal!
I've been going to Jack's since it opened and it's Old Reliable in terms of brunch
Good food, nice folks and totally comfortable
I had my birthday dinner there a couple of years ago and they were wonderful to us - we had a group of 15 and they worked with us to reserve a space and develop a menu
Really nice folks
this is a great restrunt good food good waiting and great for kids i would no i am a young ladie myself
This restaurant is so pretty, cozy and clean! I love it! The food is outstanding and the service is excellent! I had a party there last weekend and turned out great! They did an excellent job! I was very satisfied and can't wait to go back
WOW!WOW!WOW! THE FOOD WAS FANTASTIC
THE SERVICE FROM THE YOUNG MAN LATER TO FIND HE OWNED THE PLACE WAS UNBELIEVABLE
HE IS SO GRACIOUS AND PLEASING
HE TAKES GENUINE PRIDE TO NEEDS
I have been eating at Moon Shadow for almost 5 years
Since they opened
I've always been amazed that it isn't more popular
The decor is pretty cool, the location is ideal and the prices are reasonable
They are the only Thai place that consistently uses fresh ingredients
The service is always gracious and prompt
My favorite meal: Green Papaya Salad (Som Tom), Spicy Soup (Tom Yum Kung), Sticky Rice, and Phad Thai Shrimp
from what seem to be hundreds of thai restaurants in greenpoint and williamsburg, moonshadow is severely underrated
simple decor with great lighting, and the food is well presented and delicious
the seared tofu and summer rolls are perfect, and the sesame beef is sauteed just right
highly recommended
I agree with the previous reviewer
Cobble Grilled used to be awesome
Great sandwiches and salads, friendly service, and reasonable prices
Now it's $20 for 2 salads with brown lettuce and green tomatoes
The grocery market across the street has fresher tomatoes
they should start getthing their produce there
It was horrible
I would not recommend this place to anyone nor ever go back

They keep it simple, offering just 4 pizzas: marinara, margherita, bianca, and filetti
The pizzas are personal-sized (roughly 12), and are relatively pricey at $16
95, but worth every penny
Don't go for the ambience, don't go for the service, don't go for fancy toppings
Go for absolutely wonderful pizza that is easily on par with the best anywhere in the city
The Scene The boisterous restaurant, decorated in hues of amber and burgundy, looks inviting through its spacious Orchard Street windows
Wooden tables scattered throughout the upstairs and downstairs dining rooms are augmented by more private curtained-off booths and a bar
Service is friendly and appropriately laid-back for the drink-and-mingle crowd
The Food The menu has kitschy flair--your whole table dipping apples and chunks of grilled bread into a goat cheese fondue gets the party started nicely
Multicultural entrees emphasize dressed-up comfort food, such as the breaded pork cutlet, which gets a boost from its stuffing of Gruyere cheese
A cooked-to-order burger, aptly titled the Tasty Burger, delivers the best bang for your buck--get it topped with avocado as an ode to the restaurant's California siblings
Mahi mahi shines over its side of overly sweet sticky rice and over-salted asparagus
The build-your-own theme extends to dessert, where an order of smores is de rigueur
delicious, upscale comfort food which tastes great, with prices that are hard to beat
fun atmosphere and fabulous mojitos
great place for groups
Go for a loud but festive atmosphere for appetizers and drinks before your night out
But, if you're expecting more, you'll be disappointed
The food was inconsistent
My girlfriend liked her salad and appetizers, but my hamburger was mediocre at best and the fries stale
My hamburger patty was so salty it would go unspoiled for months on a 18th century seafaring vessel
If you mess up something as simple as a hamburger then I am all ready wary
The service was OK, but a little slow and overwhelmed
Took ten minutes for our waitress to introduce herself
She was inattentive, and didn't seem particularly friendly, except of course, when handing us the check
The tables were too tight and poorly arranged so that to get to a few tables the servers had to constantly squeeze past me and other customers
The bar area was right up against the tables
I'm a foodie and I'll admit it, but I really like a place with the whole package: service, ambiance, drinks and food
SO, the service is wonderful, if not exceedingly prompt, very nice and accommodating (sat two of us w/o reservation at 8:45 on a sat
night)
I love the ambiance; the bar is great, the lighting is romantic and the tables are chatty
Half the reason for going to this place is the drinks; try the raspberry lime ricky-fresh fruit makes the difference
AND THE FOOD!! Interesting, inventive and flavorful
Do not miss this place!
Great place for Brunch with a larger group
Nice touch with cocktails and food that are DIY, ingredients brought to the table and you make them ther and then
Try the Icebreaker, a truly original cocktail
My wife and I went there for our anniversary for the first weekend in October
We made our reservation on the web and asked for a booth
We did get our booth which was worth the wait
The bar was a nice hangout with the massive doors that open up to the street, a big plus for the warm weekend it was
Once we were seated, we couldnt believe how inexpensive the prices were on the menu and how friendly the staff was
We got out of there with a couple of cocktails, appetizer, and entrees for under $100
We tried the goat cheese fondue and the tuna poke for an appetizer, both were excellent
For the entree we had the ravioli and the halibut, which was a little salty, but was good and came with a nice presentation
I was all prepared to give a good word to this establishment until a couple minutes before I was ready to leave
My fiance and I had a really great dinner
excellent food and drinks
with marginal service
We waited an overly long time before we were greeted and given our first round of drinks
In addition, we waited 15 minutes for our last round of drinks
However, the food and atmosphere made up for this
We finished our meal and were finishing up conversation (15-20 minutes TOPS), when we were ASKED TO LEAVE!!! I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life
and I am well aware of the camping rules, as I worked in a restaurant for 5 years
I find this absolutely unacceptable, especially after spending $165 (with a healthy tip, despite the service) for the two of us for dinner in a casual place!
Hip Cool with drinks that are not only inventive but delecious--try the one with the frozen grapes
Great atmosphe you can sit out in the dinning room or choose a private booth draw the curtains and have your own selcluded dinner
Speaking of dinner--dont miss the fondue or tuna with wonton chips to start
The pastas are tasty and not overcooked --go for the ravioli -you won't be able to put it in your mouth fast enough
Breaded pork and Halibut also score at the top
And for desert try making your own s'mores or carmel apples--not only delicious but more fun than you'd think Great staff especially the GM who went out of his way to make sure my freinds and I had an outstanding time I'll be back and you should be too
It starts from the moment you walk into the place
Fabulous decor with private pull curtain booths! Nothing like having a private dining experience! Good looking trendy crowd adds to the open dining area on the street
The KITCHEN stands for the great food at great affordable prices
As well, it comes out pretty quickly
Love a no wait time especially when you are hungry
Be sure to have the Mussels, Tuna, or Ravioli to start
Cocktails stand for the variety of specialty well mixed drinks
Be sure to have the Scorpion Bowl for two to start
Totally sets the evening off right as you look through the menu
Overall A+~
Easily one of my worst meals in the city
Poor service, watered down drinks, and terrible food that is trying too hard to be innovative
it was either bland or over seasoned to the point where you couldn't eat it
Went here last friday because a friend wanted to have dinner somewhere trendy but low key
The place was open to the sidewalk and we got a great table at the sidewalk on a Friday night without reservations
We had the fondue ( it was ok, the bread was too crispy)
I had the fried trout, it was good but had bones in it
The drinks were good
Surely not watered down
We also got the Volcano bowl (?) Its basically a bowl of liquor that is on fire when brought to your table ( for sharing) It was tasty
Good Place
I plan to come back to try brunch
good for dinner and drinks on a low key night
Our party of 6 was literally seated in front of the kitchen
Talk about lack of ambience
The floor looked so scuffy I thought a rave went on the night before
The food was tasty if you like your main ingredient to be salt
And for a place called Kitchen and Cocktails, their cocktail list was shorter than an us weekly article
The front part of the restaurant did look alot more fun and lively
I would recommend if you'e just looking for a late night spot for appetizers and drinks
A large group, ~9, had a fabulous dinner at Kitchen Cocktails
The waitstaff was very nice and went out of their way to make sure we were serviced well
The food was great and quite reasonable
I highly recommend the tuna poke and moules frites
In terms of ambience chill and cool
For couples, they have these side booths/cabanas and each has curtains outside and a chandelier inside
very romantic
The LES is definitely the up and coming place with great restaurants like Kitchen Cocktails
We went to Kitchen and Cocktails on a Sunday night

Drinks and amazing
The staff is very polite and on top of things
Can get crowed at times and annoying to have to walk through bar to reach restaurant
The Apple Martini is great, it is made with fresh apple puree
And the Passion Fruit Tart with carimalized banana is so satisfying
was a bit leary of the restaurant b/c of the unfavorable reviews i had read - i had an entirely different experience with 3 friends 2 nights ago
the service from the moment i entered the restaurant was attentive and perfect
erica our waitress was on top of every single detail
the food presentation was as artistic as it was amazingly delicious
we had an experience that was truly memorable
highly recommend this restaurant but it is certainly expensive even by new york city standards
true foodies with no budget are the only folks who should eat here, not bargain hunters
Having read the ridiculous too salty ratings, was curious to see for myself
Have now been 3 times, a fair test
Bartenders are quality mechanics Our group has agreed the following describe the food: interesting, bold, quality, occasionally incompatible, creative
Service top notch
Not as good as it gets, but often close
I was truly disappointed with my experience at Town
Having lived in NY for most of my life, I've been around the block, so to speak, when it comes to the NY food world
I don't mind spending good money for quality food and attentive service, but Town is not a place I was happy to spend the $100 a head that it demands
The service was down right embarrassing
My party of 4 had an 8pm reservation and still had to wait 40 minutes before being seated
After a brief apology for the wait, our waitress seemed to disappear for most of the night
One of the members of my party complained to the manager about our service but even he was never to be seen again
The food was interested but nothing earth shattering
I would strongly recommend NOT wasting your time or money at Town
If you expect great food and attentive service for a $100 per person dinner, go elsewhere
We had a reservation, but had to wait a half hour for our table
Once we sat down, the service was absolutely horrendous
We hardly ever saw our waitress and we waited at least 40 minutes from the time our entrees were cleared until the time we got dessert menus
When someone in our group got up to complain to the manager, he didn't apologize or seem concerned - said he'd go check the times to see what was going on but we never saw him again
The food was adequate, definitely not worth the $68 prix fixe
If you're going to pay these prices for dinner, you are better off going to one of NYC's more highly acclaimed restaurants (e
g
Le Bernardin) where the food is great and the service top notch
Looking to woo a date or treat a client? Want to wow your out-of-town friends? Bring them to Town, where, thankfully, the food matches the high-energy buzz and slick setting
After pushing yourself through the insanely crowded bar area to get to the hostess stand, you'll be whisked downstairs for a most memorable meal
Amid a mix of high-powered executives, pretty young things, well-heeled tourists, celebrating couples and the occasional Page Sixer, well-trained waitstaff deliver scrumptious dishes like risotto with plump escargot, tender ribeye steak served atop braised short ribs, and the gotta-taste-it-to-believe-it veal tongue
A year on, the hype has yet to die down, so reservations are a must
Hint: dress to impress
I've been to Town for lunch and last night for dinner
We were 30 min late for reservations and were still seated immediately in a packed house
I cannot remember our waiter's name, but he was fabulous/great personality
Unfortunately, though - the service was slower than expected
But the food is worth some wait
The seafood is very fresh - a lot of great flavor in all of their dishes
The dessert (sourdough chocolate cake mango upside down cake!) is fabulous
The crowd is fairly diverse, though more up-townish and older
we showed up almost 20 minutes late for our 10 p
m
reservation, so we encountered a little attitude at first (and an attempt by the staff to rush us into ordering right away), but once we got settled and they realized that we were there to spend some money and have a good time, they all relaxed, and from then on the service was impeccable
the atmosphere is trendy, upscale and lively, the wine list has some pretty outstanding selections, and our entire meal never dipped below superb
even when they informed us they were out of the port we chose to accompany our dessert, the manager made sure that we were offered an even better bottle that wasn't even featured on the menu
if you're looking for a excellent dining experience with attentive service in a very NYC ambience, this is a good place to visit
Very pretty setting
Nice of a date or group of people
Wait staff was very helpful and friendly
Had a going away dinner and the service before and after was wonderful
Especially for NY standards
Food was phenomenal, service exemplary, presentation impeccable
What's not to love? Reserve far in advance
Town was perfect from beginning to end
The space is chic elegant
They treated me like a movie star, and I looked around hoping to glimpse the real thing
The entire dinner was fantastic, but I still talk about the chocolate beignets
Definitely check this one out
Beautiful Room
Georgeous
Great Plates
I am there everytime in NYC
Then off to the threatre
Food selection is limited (pre-fix), but really really good
Close to Nobu and Bouley's standard
The crowd is older, but not stuffy
Spacious feeling not noisy even when packed
Service is attentive, but not annoying
We were seated within 10 minutes
The only downside is that the meal takes too long (3 hours), and wine selections are on the expensive side (of course)
I wouldn't call this romantic place though
More of a bring-your-parents or wow-out-of-towners place
Finally a place with great food and IN
Worst experience I have ever had at a nice NYC restaurant, and believe me, I've had my fair share
If you are not from old money and you are not over 50, this place is not for you
The Food was great, but the menu is quite limited
The ambiance was romantic and elegant, but the help, fuggedaboutit! The hostest treated me and my boyfriend, like we were homeless people who walked off the street, and we were very nicely dressed I might add
Did I mention that reservations don't exist there
we waited a not so pretty half an hour for our 10:30pm reservation
If you are looking to blow $400 on a dinner, there are plenty of other places who would appreciate your business
The Scene The space, with the exception of a front lounge area where svelte women in shimmery sleeveless tops serve cosmopolitans, strikes a Mediterranean-home accent--open kitchen, a huge floor-covering rug, lemon walls--that is apropos to the chef's style
The Food English occasionally works in a familiar sort of luxurious French mode, but his best offerings are those forcefully flavored offerings that find their provenance in Provence and Italy
Not surprisingly, olives are responsible for many of the successes, such as a soft tart filled with olives, goat cheese and sweet caramelized onions
Pastas are excellent, especially the remarkable veal-filled agnolotti with white truffles
My boyfriend lives in Miami, but we go to Olives whenever he is in town
In January, we didn't order an appetizer so the waiter recommended one with oysters (forget the name)
Delicious! I also had the Pomegranate Sour recommended by another reviewer
I don't drink due to low tolerance, but I loved this drink
I usually get sleepy, but with the food, atmosphere, and company, I became happy and giddy
Despite being an introvert, something came over me and I got silly with a napkin on my head
My boyfriend was very pleased with our experience
When the bill came, he asked me what 20% was for the gratuity

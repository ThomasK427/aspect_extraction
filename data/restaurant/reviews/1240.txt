The meal I ordered was out of stock, and my second choice arrived late
Our plates were cleared as though they were rushing us out- very rude and untraditional for even wannabe-upscale places
We didn't even get to hear the specials! And here I thought I'd be getting special attention in the empty theatre-time restaurant
So much for that! Back to training school with this new place!
I took my family from out-of-town for a pre-theater dinner here
While we were seated promptly - the meal and experience soon turned sour
The vegetable antipasti were overdone and soggy, turning each item into a mealy mess
A ravioli dish actually made one of the members of our party ill later in the evening
The seafood entrees were lackluster including a crab dish served in-shell with contained little to no meat or taste
Aside from the food being mediocre we ended up waiting 45 (coincidence?) minutes for our entrees thus were forced to gulp down our coffee and run out of the place
I can say however that our show after dinner was enjoyable but the show inside Bond 45 is more carnival than theater
The atmosphere is great, absolutely beautiful
I loved how attentive the servers are
Even the managers come around and talk to you
Not only that, but the managers are also walking around giving out cookies
If you decide to go here (which I highly recommend) go early and sit at the bar for a little while before your reservation time
There is an adorable French bartender, who is an absolute sweetheart
Went with some friends and had a great time
We had heard that it was a fun place and it lived up to our expectations
We would make 2 suggestions to the owners though
1) the waitstaff should carry a list of the antipasti selections when they take orders
The wonderful dishes that you see as you're walking into the restaurant are plentiful and you can order a selection of 3 as an appetizer, but you have to remember which ones you wanted because they're not listed individually on the menu - we all order 3 different selections and none of our plates came back correct even though everything they brought was good
2) the glass wall that surrounds the antipasti should be a little higher to protect it from coughs of gazing patrons crammed in the entranceway waiting for a table
The whole experience was just alright
Nothing to write home about
The place is pretty and the food is flavorful BUT lacking character
My family and I (5 people) were in NYC to see Rent on Sunday, 2/20
We originally were going to go to Carmine's but found the staff to be somewhat rude
We left and happened upon Bond 45
My kids were impressed by the sleek appearance of the place requested that we try it
At first, I thought it was going to cost me a small fortune
But to my surprise the bill was reasonable and we left completely satisfied and more than content
We enjoyed each appetizer, main dish and dessert
I loved the way they came around to the tables with free cookies and appetizers
We truly enjoyed ourselves and I would high recommend this establishment to others and, in fact, have already done so to several co-workers
Thank you for making our dinner memorable
The Scene The airy room feels welcoming with its pressed tin ceiling, white subway tiles and open seating arrangement of booths and tables
A huge Coca-Cola sign dominates the bar, and cute waiters whisk plates of 'cue across the dining room and to the sidewalk patio
A mix of Chelsea boys, West Village families and casual dates all enjoy the low-key environs
The Food A starter of the addictive Vidalia onion rings makes a great opener, although it's served with too little creamy Maytag blue cheese dip
Oysters, either as a starter or on the po'boy sandwich, are heavily breaded, deep-fried and served with garlic aioli
The tender ribs, smoked with hickory, apple and cherry woods, do the job, but some may take issue with their mild flavor, also present in the pulled Carolina pork
A side of cheesy, creamy mac and cheese, is comfort food fare at its best
After waiting a very long time for service and food, we were all disappointed with our greasy, fatty ribs
5 all New Yorkers ate here
The RIBS were FATTY
SERVICE RUDE
All of us agreed never to come back
This ain't no Virgils
Don't waste your money
I happend to stop by this place while wondering around the west village aimlessly
I saw there lunch special and decided to stop in
I got a great deal on a pulled pork sandwich that comes with either a bowl of soup or a salade
Must say the pulled pork sandwich was Very satisfying and for 6
95 it's a lunch time bargen
When my husband and I left the South and moved to the West Village ten years ago, we thought we'd never have good bbq again
(Beggin' your pardon, but, Dallas BBQ has nothin' to do with either) But man, we were whistlin' dixie after our first trip to the Bone Lick Park
I can sum up my eatin' experience in just five words: Ribs, ribs, ribs, ribs, ribs
Do not pass go; do not collect your Friday paycheck; spend every cent you have on their Baby Back ribs
Not too sweet, not too spicy, just right
this place is a great spot for some down home southern treats, the iceberg wedges and fried oysters really hit the spot and remind a southern transplant like myself of home
The minty mojitos were surprisingly strong for the low price of $3
50 and the ribs were exceptional
there is a warm feel about this place maybe its the wood smoke pit in the back or the huge coca cola sign
Whatever it is i'll be back again
I was greeted at the door promptly by a sever who was holding 3 different plates in his arms, he pleasantly told me he would be right back to seat me as soon as he was free, without any annoyance or distress in his face
I was surprised at this and already felt comfortable
When I was seated I started off with with a yummy margarita; the flavor was packed with peach, Georgia peach to be exact
Then I took the waiters recommendation and tried the Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs, which always includes one side of my choice! Bone Lick Park is the perfect addition to the neighborhood
And I fully recommend to my closest of friends and family as well as my neighbors and fellow New Yorkers
The only good thing I can say about this place is that the service was prompt and accomodated our large group very well
In every other way though, it was average AT BEST
I have never tasted such dry, unflavorful baby back ribs and the oysters were so heavily breaded as to be almost inedible
The pulled pork was decent and so were the wings (not spicy though)
The decor was totally uninspiring
Even our margaritas tasted like cheap tequila
I will not be going back
Ever
There's too many great places in this city to waste my time on something so mediocre
Maybe I came at a better time, but I found what was obviously the same owner helpful and really accommodating
I was part of n impromptu larger group and had several questions of my own
Not only did he go out of his way to find a place for us in the busy restaurant, but he walked a couple of people in our group through some particularly difficult dietary requirements
As I had no such restrictions, I feasted on the baby back ribs, baked beans and cornbread and enjoyed every bite
The service was very friendly, and I love the room - unlike any other in the city
Would I go back? No quesion about it
I love ths place
I called yesterday with two questions and was told to look at the menu
I went anyway and was greeted by the rude owner who practicly ripped our outside drink from our hands (although we were trying to throw it out anyway
) He then sat at the front door the entire time making phone calls and making the entire lunch hour feel tense
The waiters are usually cute and friendly and effective, but they seemed understandably on edge under the circumstances
The lunch special for 6
95 are a great deal
I love the Coca Cola sign behind the bar and the Woolworth vintage chairs
Bone Lick Park could stand to get real bread rolls as opposed to the processed Wonder Bread type
The owner would probably be better put to use behind the scenes dealing with business--leaving the floor open to the friendly and competent staff
after reading the reviews, i decided to go here on my birthday yesterday
at first the service was snail slow, but after flagging down a different waiter, it was ok
the food was good, not great
the oyster were too heavily breaded, the iced tea not sweetened
ever try to but sugar into regular iced tea? you can never disolve the sugar

Bartender made a bad drink for me and I sent it back and was charged for it
I checked my coat and umbrella with the helpful host
He was so excited to get us to our seats that he lost the ticket and I was given the wrong umbrella and they could not find my umbrella
Lastly, went I felft rushed by the staff to eat quckly as the had tables to turn
There are so many other really nice restaurants in New York that there is no need to rush to this one
I chose Guastavinos for my wedding reception dinner (for 19 of us) and planned it through their private dining staff
The wedding was 3 months ago, and we are all still talking about how wonderful this restaurant was
They were so patient throughout the planning process (our guest # changed many times over a year, as well as the menu, etc
) and so helpful, as I planned it all long distance
All of the food (including my cake- made by their pastry chef for a very reasonable price) was impressive, but more than anything their staff was just phenomenal
Friendly, helpful, patient, understanding
went out of their way to make our wedding special
We were in the Granite Arch room
definately the most beautiful part of this gorgeous restaurant
I can't wait to return to NYC for an anniversary dinner!
infuriating
inefficient
I could go on and on
Okay, I will say that the space is gorgeous
And the drinks are tasty
We sat outside, so I can't comment on the bar scene
BUT - dinner was HORRENDOUS
Had the calamari app, which TGIFriday's makes better, and the scallop ceviche - that is NOT ceviche! Bland, sliced scallops in boring tomato coulis and raw green, red, and yellow peppers
ugh
Then had the BBQ Brisket with Goat Cheese and Sage Spoonbread and Spicy Slaw
The beef was typical - typical flavor, typical lconsistency, but the spoonbread did not have any of the listed ingredients in it, that's for sure, and the slaw was too spicy to eat
And our server was slow and nasty
Hey honey, if it's too hot to work outside, QUIT! THANK GOD someone else is taking them over
They suck!
Totally cool venue! I wish I had gotten the gig to DJ
I guess its better to work for these promoter gigs then to buy a ticket for them
They had the most kick ass raw bar built into the place - I am so back there for oysters!  It was crowded, but the good kind of crowded - you could still breathe and actually to get to the bar for drinks!
Second visit here with customers and everyone was very impressed
When you can impress NYers in the city it speaks for itself
Excellent presentation of all dishes
The sampler appetizer was a good mix of clams,osysters and great tuna tartare
The main dishes were a variety steaks and fish
The filets were melt in your mouth
The grouper presentation is a mild broth with vegetables was very tasteful
The deserts were very nice and not too large on the portions
Service could have been more attentive
Overall great food and atmosphere
Dear god, wherever do they get their waitresses!!! Beautiful is easy to find in NYC, but knowledgeable? Never
Here though our lovely server, Kathy was on top of everything, we were 100% taken care of, and guided through an evening of satisfaction
She helped to navigate through the muddy wine list and menu, spot on!!! One of us had a bum oyster, nothing big, but she was so helpful that we actually had no further complaints, (a bad oyster is taboo), and without reducing a penny allowed us to feel like VIP, in front on my wife's boss
Thank GOD!
Thank Guastivino's
Kudos
On our recent visit to NY we were introduced to Guastavinos and had a wonderful meal and evening (with the kids)
The place is easy to get to and find, simply say under the 59th Street Bridge
The space is wonderful, built in the substructure of the bridge
The food and service were both world class
The fresh seafood was outstanding
We had the clams, shrimp and mussels
Vegetarians also have great options here as my wife found out
We brought our kids and they enjoyed the food and the coloring provided
I would recommend Guastavinos
Having been to Conran restaurants in London (Bluebird and Pont de la Tour) I had high hopes for this one unfortunately this was terrible
One of the people I was with had to send his mussels appetizer back as more than half of them were closed
For the entre I had the duck which was mostly fat and a friend had the beef which was mostly gristle
The best part though they saved until dessert
We were given 3 dessert menus each one of them different and with different prices
Listed on the menu for Sherries it says great with our cheeses
When asked where the cheeses were listed, our server told us they dont do cheeses! At this point we paid and left
I can understand why the beautiful people enjoy this restaurant
The bartenders are incredibly snobbish and the wait service is so poor you're bound to be able to keep on your diet
especially a starvation diet
After an hour, the four of us left in disgust after only having our appetizer served
Thank you Sir Terrance Conran for proving to America that British-inspired food and British-owned restaurants can stand up there with the best of them!   I went on a Friday night, the atmosphere was buzzing and the food the best I have eaten in New York for a long, long time, my trout in particular was excellent as was the bourbon cake and chocolate mousse that I couldn't finish
My partner's beautifully pink, melt in the mouth pork was cooked to perfection and the cocktails were well up to par
Bravo!
After reading about this restaurant in a number of places, I went expecting a really cool setting, and excellent food
We ate on the lower floor (I guess the top floor is for private events only now), under a wooden slated ceiling, and not the impressive underside of the bridge
As a result, from our vantage point, the space was nothing special
I think they could do alot more to trump up the space there, and the ceiling
The food, while good, was also not of the calibre I was expecting, although I will say the dessert (some type of apple pastry), was divine
Guastavino's is the absolute worst! We were made to stand outside for no reason, but to make the place look happening
After crossing the 1st barrier, we waited in a 2nd line to be patted down for weaponry (women with cleavage are treated like royalty)
After you feel like a criminal, Men wait in a 3rd line to pay cover ($20+)
Inside, the place was empty compared to the line outside
The crowd was wannabe's and Bridge/Tunnel people
The DJ/music was lameit was like they had the radio playing at full volume
If you wanted to get upstairs, cash/favors seem to work
I found out later that the upstairs was no different than the 1st floor
In all, I would rather step on a rusty nail than step into Guastavino's again
If you find yourself waiting in line for this lounge/club, turn around and run!
- very good menu (especially the chocolate cake for dessert!) -prices expensive ($25 a appetizer) - nice place - service ok
The place is beautiful, and the architecture is something to look at
The food was so-so
It was definitely over-priced
The best part about the whole dining experience was the attentive staff
I took my boyfriend to this restaurant figuring it would be a nice place to enjoy a birthday meal
As soon as I walked in, I was easily impressed by the architecture
The host greeted us warmly and eagerly and the wait staff was just as receptive
The only dissatisfation was the lack of specials and considering that I ordered the most expensive meal on the menu, the proportion of the meal itelf left something to be desired
Otherwise, the food itself was incredibly delicious
I had dinner there with a few friends and was pleased
The food was overpriced and nothing special but that was expected
The service was pretty decent and the ambience was nice
Guastavinos is a place that has nice aesthetics, but, little else

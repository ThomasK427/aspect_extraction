I've tried almost everything on the menu and the cuisine is absolutely amazing! If you want great food without breaking the bank then try this place
There is a fantastic pre fix menu during the week and you can't beat that
Liquors is a tiny place and can get really crowded on weekends but it's worth the wait for brunch or dinner
In the summer and fall they open up the back court yard for dining and lounging which relieves some of the congestion inside
truly nice staff, talented chef, cozy decor - a fine evening will be had
Just moved to the neighborhood and stumbled upon this place
the staff was extremely gracious, the garden setting in the back was pleasant
We ordered mojitos which were better than the ones I had at a couple of Cuban restaurants in Manhattan
I had the jerk-rubbed pork loin over garlic mashed potatoes with sauted bok choy
ohmagod! What a great surprise! Can't wait to see what else Fort Greene has to offer
need to try this place for brunch!
One of my favorite restaurants in the 'hood
Eclectic menu and some of the best mojitos around
Liquors' brunch is one of the best in Brooklyn
For 12
50 you get tons of food that is prepared with real care and a flair for something interesting
Blackened salmon for brunch? Hell yeah
Good cocktails, nice garden, great place
Highly recommend it
I had dinner here and thought it good but a little overpriced for what it was
I had brunch here, though, and thought it an incredible bargain: good food, low price, outdoor seating
Service might have been a little slow, but nobody's perfect
Worth a visit and maybe even a return
The Scene If you can make your way through the gauntlet of baseball-capped margarita-drinkers at the bar, you'll find a brightly colored room, with Hopi dolls and Native American paintings lining the walls
It sort of feels like a gift shop
The Food The first New York outpost of a popular Phoenix spot, Los Dos Molinos serves the hybrid cuisine of New Mexico
While the menu and the servers caution about how spicy the food is, there's nothing here that would make the average Szechuan-hardened New Yorker blink
More accurate warnings would inform you of bland guacamole and heavily salted pork dishes
Peppy, fresh-tasting salsas, and real corn flavor in the tortillas are a cut above the average
Sadly, though, most subtlety is buried under haphazard cooking and puddles of melted cheese
Is that how you say it? Forget the trendy places, this resaturant is tops
Why? Because its never insanely crowded, so cozy for dates, the service is pleasant, the food is delicious, the magaritas well poured and the cost is insanely reasonable
The best part - feels like you discovered this place yourself, instead of being sent there by some fab magazine
Over the past four years I've eaten here a number of times and each time I go the food and the service gets worse
Recently I ate here with my husband and we were absolutely uphauled
The service was offensive
It seemd to be a huge undertaking to actually get menus and order our food
I actually had to go up to the bar and ask for my check because I was so sick of looking at our plates of nasty food
The $12 margaritas are made from a cheap, generic sour mix that you can probably get at any average bar
For one tamale and a taco, it cost me close to $17 - A total waste of money
I have been frequenting the place for about 4 years, and the food is AMAZING (if you can stand the serious heat of their REAL new mexican hatch chilies  Great margaritas, UNREAL salsa sauces
Los Dos Molinos is the best mexican around
Food is great, Margaritas are awesome (get a kick ass!), crowd is good and the staff are welcoming
It can get crowded sometimes, so waiting a little while is likely but the largarites make the time fly by
Los Dos Molinos has the spicist food of any restaurant I have been to
And by far the spiciest mexican in NYC! I eat spicy food all the time
I had the Chimichanga with Carne Adovado
That could be the spiciest thing there
It was good but I was sweating the whole time
Afterwards, I spent a lot of time on the toliet - it did a number on my stomach
Basically, if you want spicy or a challenge - come here
If you can't handle spice, don't even try
I see people returning their food all the time because it is too spicy
They must be tired of that
I travel for a living all across the USA and even to other countries
This is one of my favorite little gems for decent Tex Mex style food here in NYC
Don't bother asking for anything not spicy
It doesn't exist nor should it in Tex Mex
If it doesn't have heat, your probably eating at some boring chain restaurant!  Try the margaritas
they have a kick yet oh so smooth! The enchiladas are tasty, spicy, and served with a traditional fried egg on top
Down side is they don't take reservations even for large groups
So if you have a large group, call ahead and try to get there early
They will try to accomodate you but they make no promises
It's not fancy, but it's also not overly priced
If you are at all sensitive to spicy food, you should avoid eating here
While particularly spicy dishes on the menu are denoted with a red pepper, even the ones that are mild are scorching hot
Immediately after the first bite of salsa, I started to sweat
Both the salsa roja and the salsa verde (traditionally a bit 'cooler') were essentially inedible, and the pork burro put me over the top
The dish - ostensibly a simple tortilla wrapped around shredded spiced pork - was resting on in a thin pool of red oil
I can only imagine that this was some sort of chile oil (or other chile derivate
) The spice in this oil was so overpowering that the taste of the meat was completely lost
I don't want to rant too much, but from an honest food lover, this restaurant is really a bad choice
I love Los Dos Molinos! You better like it hot! Everything is good
I order the pork
The cheese crisps are a killer app! I always walk out of this place feeling great
One of the best, if not the best New Mex/Tex Mex in all of manhattan! Trust me
Sometimes its impossible to replicate greatness, sometimes it works
Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix has become an institution
With little advertising, a family out west has created a restaurant with flair, amazing food and a die hard following
Every time Im in Phoenix, I make it for a meal- if not more
I was thrilled when I found a NYC location
As a native NYer I was afraid that the new location would be a let down
Los Dos Molinos, NYC is as good as the ones in Phoenix (this place is not a chain)
The food is AWESOME
Yes, its HOT, but flavorful not in a lets make them hurt kind of way
The Flautas are perfectly fried (youd thought they were baked), the Enchiladas are not buried in cheese, the Burros are moist and flaky, and the secret weapon of New Mexico is available for dessert
i hate bland food, particularly bland mexican food
los dos molinos has spiciness and depth of flavor
it's my favorite mexican restaurant in new york
the meat is too greasy tho
fat runs out of the taco down your elbow
i like a lot if cheese and salt, both of which it has
the margaritas are great! the main drawbacks are that it is too loud (all hard surfaces and the noise rverberates around the restaurant) and the crowd (fratty and yuppies who think they're cool in their casual khakis)
YOU CAN ASK THEM TO PUT THE CHILE SAUCE ON THE SIDE - THEY WILL DO THIS ON ANY DISH - AND THEN YOU CAN ADD IT YOURSELF TO SUIT YOUR TASTE
BEWARE IF YOU DONT DO THIS AND ARE EATING HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME - YOU WILL PROBABLY BURN YOUR MOUTH OFF IF YOU HAVE AN AVERAGE PALETTE
ANYWAY, THE FOOD HERE IS GREAT, I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE, AND ITS ALSO A GREAT ATMOSPHERE FOR A MEXICAN PLACE
LOS DOS MOLINOS IS ALWAYS ALOT OF FUN
P
S
IGNORE THE EDITORIAL REVIEW ON THE MAIN PAGE HERE FOR THIS RESTAURANT - NEVER TRUST A WRITE WHO COMPARES HOT MEXICAN FOOD TO SZECHUAN! INSTEAD, TRUST MEC- THE FOOD IS RED HOT, SO ASK FOR THAT CHILE SAUCE ON THE SIDE AND ADD IT IN YOURSELF! CHEERS, LOS DOS!

If you order from the a la carte menu, you get 3 pieces per your order ie-tuna-3 pieces
The uni was delicious and heavenly
The service was pretty efficient too
I would definitely return
This small east village find was exactly what we have been looking for
the food was delicious and the prices we amazingly low
Definatly check out there 2 for the price of one rolls
Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, never even letting our drinks near the empty status
Best part was that we walked in starved and were immediatly seated, no wait at all on a friday around seven
Cherin Sushi is a phenomenal value, with excellent quality
Great variety of rolls
As of mid-August, still waiting for their sake and beer license to arrive: it's definitely coming
Worth dining there even without the sake for now
i tried all sushi places in the neighbourhood, but cherin is definetely the best of all
their fish both looks and tastes fresh
i will go there again!
I am very picky about sushi but I have to say that this place is awesome
Salmon and yellowtail are one of the best in the city
Unlike other Japanese restaurants in St
Marks, this restaurant is nice and quiet, and the service is exceptional!
If you're a sushi lover, this is a place you should definitely try
The menu is filled with a large variety of rolls and portions are generous
Service is friendly and fast
I found a lot of the items on the menu to be very interesting (in a good way) and I will definitely return to Cherin to try them
I have been there a few times the fish has been consistently fresh their chef's special rolls are amazing
As a big fan of yellowtail i can't leave cherin's sushi without eating the chef's special yellowtail lover roll!!! Cherin sushi has become my favourite sushi joint!!!
Finally, a sushi place where you really get value for the price
I have been to Cherin for a few times since it opened, and the quality has been consistent
The service is friendly and attentive, the sushi is extremely fresh and the portions are large
I would recommend the spicy tuna sushi, which is excellent along with the Cherin Roll
This is a truly rare find
For years i have traveled the streets of NYC in search of the ultimate sushi spot with the freshest fish at the most affordable prices
A taste that will without any doubt keep sushi lovers coming back for more
A spiritually romantic candlelight atmosphere, with a waitress with a smile as bright as the sun
A sushi chef creating entrees of art that will have you talking as much as eating
I was treated like a friend
If you are love sushi as much as i do
you have to see it
and taste it
to believe it
From there biggest fan across the street
THe atomsphere is very ZEN
the service is fast and professional
The food is EXTREMELY fresh
this is a new place and they are careful to have the freshish fish and VERY low prices
they also will make up a roll just for YOU
if you have an idea for a new combination
the value in this spot is incredible
they serve a few special dishes that are worth trying, like their spicy sashimi
with fresh fish and their low prices, it's hard to find another spot for susy
although it's tucked in Indian row, I don't expect this place to remain a secret for long
The sushi is great, especially their house rolls, that come with real crabmeat inside
The sashimi is also delicious
And it's very affordable, with low prices
Then this is the place for you
Excellent menu
Great sushi and low prices
You cant go wrong with this place
Low prices, great fresh fish and best of all, real crab meat mix in all of the rolls
Stuff yourself with fresh sushi for under $20, you can't go wrong
The roles are creative and delicious, the pieces are big
best fish-to-rice ratio you'll find anywhere
Excellent service
Great value
The sushi is fresh and the portions are huge
Reminds very much of the old Sandobe
This is a tucked away sushi place right off second ave on Indian food lane
The sushi is fantastic and the rolls are tightly packed
You get an enormus amount of sushi for the buck
10 bucks buys you a 15 piece half dollar sized rolls of the house specialities
Cherin does a good job with unique rolls you can't find anyplace else in the city
The Parker roll is the best with tuna, salmon, and crabmeat (real), topped with tuna and salmon! Doesn't get much better than that!  Service is very friendly and you can chill for as long as you want
I'll be back to visit
Not sure what the miserable ratings are all about- this place is great
Lots of comfy seating- both indoors and out- makes a long wait for a table unlikely
Easy relaxed atmosphere, lovely staff, delicious brunch options (both old-school basics like grits and poached eggs and more fancy varieties) great value, and magazines to read while you wait
Sit outside and lose an entire unrushed morning to bloody marys
I go to Pacifico a lot, and so was excited about Gravy opening last year
But when we first went it was so bad
I mean, bad
But recently we've been going back a lot
It's so much better now
The menu is tighter, the portions are huge, and they've figured out what to capitalize on instead of doing it all
It's super air conditioned and they've got great big booths so it's nice for a relaxed dinner out
I love the Portobello Sandwich and the Blue Plate Fried Chicken, Fried Steak, and Prime Rib are delicious
Best fries ever
I'm starting to recognize a lot of the staff, and they're hipsterish, but very curteous and relaxed
Now they've got Trout outside, the Beer Garden type thing they've converted their back patio into, and it's really nice to go out there for a cheap beer after dinner
The guys who own that corner are doing a lot of things right, it just takes them some time to smooth things out
Seriously
We went to Gravy for brunch not long ago and have not stopeed talking about what and abysmal experience it was since then
We each odered the special A greek fritata and huevos mexicanos
Let me describe
The greek fritata was essentially a disk of undercooked egg with some chopped up (and raw) onion, tomato and super salty feta dumped on top of it
Not cooked in it
And I don't know what makes this greek
it came with nothing else
The huevos was a runny, cheesy sloppy mess with a tortilla and some black beans
We had two cold cups of bad coffee too
Both were disgusting, and I'm not exagerating

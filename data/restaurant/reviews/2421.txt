We wondered in the other night out of curiosity and found a very cosy, warm little restaurant with a great waiter, great wine, and satisfying food
One of the best restaurants in NYC -- great Moraccan cuisine, prompt, efficient, attentive service, not too pricey --- it doesn't get any better than this!
Epices is great
We discovered it about three years ago and have been there about eight times
I've been as a twosome with my b/f and with a party of 5-6 people, sometimes pre-opera, sometimes mid- to late-evening
The staff are always very friendly and helpful (ignore the idiot who gave the bad review below), the owner is great, and the food is freah and interesting
It's not spectacular cuisine, but it's interesting and always enjoyable, and the price is great
The patrons are generally mature and quiet (no screaming yuppies and cell phones) when I've been there
Epices is very much a neighborhood restaurant, although I don't live on the UWS
Hopefully, not too many people will discover it so that it will still be possible to easily get a table with no reservation
In Short Pasha offers highly rated Turkish cooking in a handsome, elaborately decorated setting close to Lincoln Center
Sidewalk seating at a handful of tables offers a view of the passing scene
The entrees offered include grilled lamb chops; cornmeal-crusted grilled brook trout; and grilled lamb slices topped with yogurt, as well as a vegetarian casserole
Appetizers range from shepherd's salad through grilled octopus to mint and lamb dumplings
Dessert choices include a baked apple with pistachio ice cream
I discovered Pasha several months ago with a friend and we have gone almost weekly except during the summer
We LOVE the food, expecially the Menti, calamari and the baby lamb chops are to die for
Our favorite waiter Edu is a doll, very attentive and friendly (and cute too)
We've tried a few others but keep going back to Pasha
I like Turkish Food
This my first time at Pasha
Food not great but its ok
But Service was terrible, Very slow
And price is over value for two persons dinner $ 90
?
I moved to upper west side 2 years ago, but I have discovered this lovely place only 2 weeks ago
I took 3 of my friends there 2 weeks ago
We all loved it
What a perfect experience we had
We had that appetizer called menti little dumlings with ground lamb in creamy yogurt sauce is die for
And the calamari is absolutely best in the city, very tender and tasty
And main courses cubes of lamb over eggplant puree and chicken breast with stuffed special rice are super delicious
And last but not least all the people who work there are very good looking and very very friendly, they were always smiling and gave us a great service
And the bar area is very attractive
I will go back there again and again

Review before this made me laugh a little
I know that greeks do not get along with Turks but it is kind of funny to write a review about Turkish restaurant and recommend a Greek restaurant around just the corner
Living near Chelsea, getting to this restaurant is quite a hike for me
But after trying it, I'd say I'd go back again in a heartbeat
We went on a Monday night, the restaurant was filled but not overcrowded and not noisy
Service was very attentive
Decor is very comfortable and fits the Turkish theme
Food was excellent
I don't remember the turkish names but there's a cold appetiser made of thumb-sized dumplings stuffed with a bit of minced meat and served with a tangy, creamy sauce, and there's a main course that's minced chicken meat reformed into a kebab and grilled, served with yellow rice
These 2 dishes are very very very delicious
This place is average compared to the other turkish restaurants I have visited
The food is not bad, I would say just below average for the price
The service was good, but I just did not feel a welcomed atmosphere
It can get a little crowded, but its worth the wait
Big bold turkish flavors in a comfortable environment
Def
make reservations
A large group and I went to Pasha for the first time this past Saturday night
It's not often that everybody in the group is completely satisfied, let alone estatic about their meals
However, everybody loved Pasha
The atmosphere was great, the service was exceptional, and most importantly, the meal was exquisite
I highly recommend any lamb dish, especially the grilled baby lamb chops
Also, try the bakalva for dessert
You'll be pleased
Just remember to make reservations
Some friends recommended we try this place, and even though we'd neevr had Turkish food before, we thought we'd give it a try
It was fabulous! Everything--the ambiance, waiting staff, fellow dinners, and of course the food was superb
I now crave Turkish food at least once a week
A must try!!
I never write on web sites like this but I have to write about Pasha
What a beautiful night I had there with my girlfriend last week there
I had the best meal and service
and I feel like I made new friens and they are Turkish
They are very polite, smart and fun
Manager made us feel so comfortable that we felt like we've been here hundreds of times
We have decided with my GF that we will be regulars at Pasha
Went there last night (Friday, may 13) with three of my girlfriends
Got there at 9:30, a bit of a wait at the door
The manager were friendly and let us in pretty fast
As soon as we got in, we were greeted by friendly staff
We walked into a very intimate restauran's lounge with amazing house music playing
The wine and the ambient was better then most lounges serve and the layout and decor were so comfy and swank at the same time! And the food was absolutely superb and the snorkeling out of this world :)
Went there last night
Awful food, the appetizers were cold as if they just serve it right from the fridge
The food is served like a Fast Food Restaurant killing the entire ambience
The decor and ambience is perfect but what a shame
The manager had a chip on his shoulder as if he is Commander of the ship and everyone else was at his disposal
What I great place to dine or hang out
I had great experince at pasha last week
We had dinner in the main dinning room and hang out at the bar area
Great food great and frindly service
I can not believe they have been here almost 8 years and I have just discovered it
If you want good food and friendly service GO TO PASHA
and thank me later
First of all food is unrealisticly good
If you do want to be addicted to any food in your life do not order MANTI or you will be
If you like cozy places this is a place to go
try to sit in the front room or the laounge area
And one last thing forget all the bad things you heard about turkish people I think they are the most frienly, beautiful,handsome,kind and intelligent people
If you go there you will have new friends and a place to hang out as confortable as your home
My boyfriend and I went to Pasha last night for a special celebration
The atmosphere was great: it reminded me of several upscale restaurnats in Turkey
The prices were very affordable ($6-9 for an appetizer and $13-19 for a main course)

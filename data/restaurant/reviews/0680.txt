I could see why this place would be popular and appealing for those who have never tasted in and out burgers
Unfortunately, having lived off of in and out burgers in college, this place just doesnt cut it, even if it is cheap
The fries and burgers are not fresh and crisp tasting like the cali joint
Having said that, if I lived in the neighborhood, I would still probably stop by here at least twice a month for a bite because its cheap and quick
As a LA Transplant I was looking forward to this burger shack' homage to In n' Out but sadly it just doesn't meet the real thing
The second best thing about In n' Out is the variety of styles they offer: Protein Style, Animal Style, 3x3 etc
I ordered a Protein Burger at Blue 9 and it was the ugliest things I have ever seen
It had very little lettuce wrapping it but tons of dressing drowing it
All of which made eating it an unpleasant experience
Who can tell if food is fresh when it is drowing in that much dressing
In n' Out never made the protein burger this difficult to eat
Thankfully there are better burgers in NYC
I read the reviews and ordered two burgers, fries and two shakes to be picked up
The fries at first bite were good but were fried in what tasted and felt like old oil and they were salty
The burgers started out as promising but quickly became average and there was no mango sauce although it was requested
The shakes were ok, the vanila so-so and the chocolate was pretty good
For two people who were starving and were very enthusiastic when we read the reviews wer e ultimately left flat in the end
I've heard i-N-out is the best from friends in CA
I hopre they are better than blue 9's
Blue 9 is reminiscent of the West Coast burger chain, In-N-Out
Everything is fresh and made to order
Must try the mango sauce with the burgers or fries
They deliver too
but don't expect it to be quick
It's a shame there is only one
fresh tasting, made to order burgers with fresh veggies and tasty sauce
a focused menu which enables them to efficiently and quickly serve a made to order meal
hand dipped shakes and fresh cut fries
what more would one want for what it is?
Blue 9 does not come close to a good burger
who ever said its like in-n-out has never been to in-n-out
They have the worlds worst fries and the meat is like the kind you get in a public school caf
The place looks like a coffe shop and a burger joint
Take it from someone whos from CA do NOT spend your money or time at blue 9
I think I'm in love
The burgers are amazing and it's the perfect pit stop on the way home after a long night out
Don't miss it!
Not quite In-N-Out from the West Coast but close enough
Better burger than alot of burger joints around the city
Great burger and shakes at great prices, I'll take it until In-N-Out makes its way to the East Coast
Burgers are good (but I think Corner Bistro rules supreme)
wait is long, fries are often burnt and cold if you get delivery
It's better then diner burgers, better then fast food burgers, but falls short of the top burgers in the city
Blue 9 is AWESOME
The Mango Chilli Dipping sauce for the fries is amazing
I can't get enough of it
I just eat it straight up
The shakes and burgers are good too but whatever you do try the mango chilli sauce, its delicious
Attention California transplants
your search for a burger that tastes like the famed West Coast In-N-Out burger has come to an end
Blue 9 on 12th Street and 3rd Ave in the East Village
Almost identical (except they need to toast both sides of the bun, grease the top of the bun and the patty needs to be a tiny bit larger and the meat a little sweeter
maybe east coast meat is different?) Except for a few subtle differences (I have had enough of In N Out to be considered an expert
) this place gives us burger lovin' Californians a little extra sunshine--all year round
Ain't the fries ain't bad either!
I had an outstanding lunch experience there today
This place only makes burgers, french fries and milk shakes and they're great at it
This place has been open only 7 weeks, but it will become an NYU hangout come Sept
The burgers are satisfying and delicious
The french fries are made from real potatoes and are not oily salty enough- they're very tasty! $2
35 for a burger, $1
75 for french fries
This place looks like a fast food place- not a nice decor, but if you want a great burger, this is the place to go
I highly recommend it
The Blue 9 makes a terrific cheeseburger
This is not a Corner Bistro burger and it's not a Big Nick burger, either
But it is a spectacular fresh small-patty fast food-style burger
I had no trouble with cold fries or a long wait reported by other reviewers
I've gone at off hours, though, for those late night cravings
All the way from Queens
I am willing to travel for this cheeseburger forever and I hope they NEVER open up any more or they will undoubtedly lose control of their great product just like Ranch 1 did
I felt I was eating at In-n-Out
seriously
Everytime I go to Cali, I HAVE to eat there
When I tried blue Burger, I felt i was eating from In-n-Out
I honestly felt I was in burger heaven
I like it so much, I had it for dinner two straight days!!! The service, unfortunately, was slow on the second day
But for this food, it's worth every waiting second
This burger is even more delicious than the In-N-Out burgers I used to love in SF, and at least as good as the more artisinal items you'd pick up at the occasional neighborhood places like Big Mouth or Burger Joint
And the price is unbeatable
Don't believe the naysayers who always want to be too cool for the something genuinely amazing and new to NY: Blue 9 is the real thing
I have to say these burgers are the best in Manhatten for myself
Yes the wait is a bit long but it is well worth the wait
The price is also great
I love going there to eat
Yes, In-N-Out is the CORRECT spelling
Crocodile's review could have been written by me, I agree with his assesment
Those fries are too salty! It's overpriced! The wait is too long! The patty is too small!  But I am scoring it higher than a 2 because I did find the burger to be delicious, if not up to In-N-Out standards
I think the burgers are great here
They really are fanatical about using only the freshest meat, bread and toppings and it shows
I agree with the NYTimes article that these burgers are close to the Platonic ideal of what a perfect burger should be
Quality food, an ideal balance of meat, bun and toppings, all at a great price ($3 for a cheeseburger)
What more could you ask for? The fries are excellant in my opinion though lose their flavor if you let them cool off
The service is friendly (not that McD's has really set the bar high in that regard) and though it may take about five minutes for your order to come up it is worth the wait
Chairs are a bit uncomfy but, you're really only there for a quick bite anyway
I hope they open some more locations closer to where I work
I've had In Out burgers many times and Blue 9's burgers comes pretty close to the real thing
The fries also taste fresh and similar to the California chain
The wait can be a bit ridiculous though
Try the interesting dipping sauce

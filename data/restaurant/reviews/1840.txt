Five Points promises a classy and delicious meal
This place manages to provide excellent food and service, great ambience at a good price
The pork chop was excellent, the wine selection was good
Five Points is where I take friends from out of town to get waht is best about NY
Cutting edge new American food with a Mediterranian flair in a well designed space with unpretentious service and a happening bar scene that serves great drinks all at an affordable price
What else does one need?
This bar/restaurant has great food (Best Boigers) and the mood is perfect for after work and dinner
One of the best sunday brunches I have ever had
Food is wonderful, the atmosphere is tranquil and the service is friendly
Maureen, the owner, has a winner on her hands! I recommend Five Points highly to anyone
In my book, Five Points is a golden star!!
This burger is amazing! It is made from ground up sirloin steak that is ground in house
I have never tasted a fresher or juicier burger
It comes with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe, onions, and fries, and I would challange anyone to finish the whole thing
Was here last night with a friend
Nice, but not-so special menu
Waitstaff was pleasant and the wine list decent
We sat outside and had a great time
The food isn't anything to get excitied about
I wouldn't rush to Five Points, but if I had a date and we were going out in that neighborhood later, I'd go back
We were referred to Five Points by a NYC local and it didn't let us down
Front desk was wonderful
we had a reservation at 12 15pm for NINE people and were delayed on the subway until 1pm and they held our reservation on a BUSY Sunday! The service was a little slow but the incredible food made it worth the wait!!! The Eggs Ranchero were to die for!!!
In Short With its stained-glass lamps, dark brick details and an antique-looking bar in the back, this Village staple is a fun spot for inexpensive (and late-night) American and Middle Eastern fare
The sprawling menu features everything from burgers to falafel to chocolate egg cream
Diners can rent chess and backgammon boards for a buck an hour, or take in a Charlie Chaplin silent flick on the small projection screen
after moving away from NYC and 3 years later you just can not find anything like anywhere else
The Mid Eastern platter are to die from the kabobs make my husbands mouth water even if he just had dinner
The lines are alway long but well worth it The place is a hole in the wall just like you alway hear people say when they find that great little place and THIS IS IT!! see all of you soon
Go here when you are hungover and want to pummle some great food
Pitchers of beer are cheap and so is the delicious food
Olive Tree is such a go-to spot for me!
Big chalk board tables, chess sets provided when not full, great service, so-so food, beautiful lighting, cramped center tables but spacious booths worth waiting for
Charlie Chaplin movies have been playing on a Projector here for at least 11 years- I have been coming here for that long! Great place for a first date- especially with the comedy club right downstairs
This Cozy place is the best place to go for delisious,cheap food and fast friendly service!!! the bathroom is downstairs in the comedy club and when I walked downstairs Colin Quinn was standing in the hallway and he showed me which way to go!!! It was great!!
I love this place, and am absolutely ADDICTED to their fiesta salad, which is not to be missed! The free pitas and chalkboard tables add to the friendly feel
This place is wonderful
The food and drinks were great
Our waiter was super cool
The prices are good too
Don't miss this place!
This is defitnatly one of the city's coolest spots
Service is friendly, and the comics are great! This is a great place to take your shorty, or just go with friends
You can eat, drink and laugh
Really fun!
Like everyone else has stated, the food is good and cheap
Menu is endless
The Falafel, humus, tehina, babaganoush combo was great and the nachoes come with an entire plate of sides, instead of a soggy pileup
Unlimited pitas! Margaritas are good and I got to see Dave Atell!
Great location and Middle Eastern fare with blackboard tables make for a fun dinner
Although the place is a bit small, we were seated less than 10 mins after we arrived at 7 PM on a Friday night
Food was typical but tasty nonetheless, and the sangria was very delicious and relatively cheap, although maybe not authentic
Bathroom is a long trip downstairs through the comedy club, so plan accordingly!
olive tree is my all time favorite downtown spot
the neighborhood is open very late lots of interesting stores surround this delicious place
and downstairs you can catch the comedy show, i see at least one famous comic everytime i go there just chillin at the bar
the place is cozy and the food is awesome
go for the chicken kabobs or falafel and get some drinks too
the burgers are huge and well woth the cheap price
its just a really fun affordable place
have fun drawing on the chalk board tables too!!!
Heard such good things about this place that I thought I'd check it out
and man, am I glad I did! Everything we ordered was not only FANTASTIC but CHEAP
Who knew you could have both at once?
The only place I haven't ventured on that block and I must say, much like Cafe Wha, Comedy Cellar, and the Village Underground, this place does NOT disappoint
Food was absolutely TERRIFIC and mad cheap
Where else can I get a Falafel plus plate of fries for $2
75!
This place is great - comforting food, good fast service and it's very cheap
Remember this good tip when there is a long wait for a schwarma platter - ask for a side of schwarma - it's almost as much meat as in the platter, but you can get it faster
They have great sangria and fun tables that they let you draw on with chalk
You get good wraps and burgers for your money, but it's always quite crowded and noisy
There's an odd thing with the bathroom, too because you need a hall pass with the code to get downstairs (the comedy cellar) and you have to pass by the stage to get to the bathrooms
I got heckled by the comedian last time I was there and then yelled at by the management because I didn't pay for the show
went to olive tree cafe for the first time this past friday after work
was alot of fun, absolutely love the chalkboad bar/tables sooo much fun
reasonably priced drinks
careful going to the bathroom those stairs get a lil iffy after a few too many (also stalls were tiny as well as bathrooms in general) but all in all would go back again and prolly a few more after that time
Great food, cheap food, great atmosphere, fantastic desserts, and slate tables
It doesn't get any better
Only word of warning -- it's a pain in the butt if you want to go to the bathroom, and getting a table on a weekend night is tough
But this is hands down the best cafe in the Village
Blackboard tables to play while waiting for food
To get to the bathrooms, have to walk past the stage where you might get heckled by the standup comedian that shows downstairs
Priced right too
Simply put, this is my favorite hangout in the village
The food's tasty and cheap (try the borscht or the nachos - yes, the menu's that diverse), and the ambience couldn't be more unique - any place that lets you draw on the tables with chalk is OK with me
The big screen showing Chaplin films is also fun
The service tends to be a bit on the unfriendly side, but it's worth it for the value and great food
I just discovered this little place a few weeks ago and can't get enough of it
The complete lack of decor makes it a pass for romantic occasions but overall this place is a true find (especially considering the underwhelming alternatives around Houston street)
I've now been there several times and each time the food was top notch
If only they put a little effort into decorating, the place would be mobbed
However, the super nice service and the stellar food more than make up for it
if you want great food good service at great prices that the place to go
Went here tonight with a friend
Food turned out to be descent, but the waitress disappeared from the moment we placed the order untill she came back with the check
I had to get up and drag a bus-boy to get water! That's just wrong
This place has a cool atmosphere, and is usually crowded on weekends
Nice place for lunch too

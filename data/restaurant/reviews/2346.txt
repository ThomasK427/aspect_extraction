WHAT HAPPEN TO MY SERAFINA
I went there last night- Food was par- if that
The service was horrendous
We asked for water at least 4 times
soda at least 3 times and wine 3 times
Crazy
Very frustrating
We asked the waiter to wrap up one of our dishes
It ended up getting thrown out- but the waited decided to LIE about it and say he just heated the pasta up
Why would you heat up pasta that we was left over? Wouldnt have been a big deal if he would have just said they made a mistake and they gave us fresh pasta
Who would have complained about that!
We did not partake in the pizza, but enjoyed delicious salads and pasta dishes
The key is to keep climbing the stairs until you get to the top floor; for on a clear night, the roof is retracted, and you dine under the stars
The crowd is mostly locals: a good mix of families, office workers, and dates
The environment is relaxed but refined and as romantic as you want to be
The food is well crafted and for a very decent price
If we lived in the Upper East Side, we'd be there all the time!
As a group of 15 looking for a bite to eat after visiting the Met, we happened by this place as the manager was about to walk in
We were warmly greeted seated immediately on the darling roof terrance
The waitstaff could not be more accomodating and the food was just as delightful
We will definitely return
Overpriced, but very mediocre food
I suppose that the prices do fit the neighborhood, but do yourself a favor and travel a few blocks to find someplace where you get a little bit better bang for your buck
Service was OK, but didn't make up for the bland food and $6 bottles of beer
As a frequent customer, i think the food and service is wonderful
There is no better Pizza or Pasta on the upper east side
As for the price, for the quality of food, you can not beat it
I go to Serafina because I love authentic good food and a friendly ambience, in a city where everything is overpriced, Serafina is a great value
The only problem tables are too close to each other
This is THE best pizza i ever had
their chicken pesto pizza is amazing, the staff is very friendly and it's clean
Don Filippo's serves great-tasting, serious pizza with original flavor and good consistency
Their two type olive is my favorite -- it's the best slice in this area
We don't need to pay $12
50 for someone to give us a pizza that looks like a big piece of soft cardboard with a whole bunch of Quaker State leaking off of it
Seriously, this pizza was a complete greasefest and also arrived cold
Has the management of this place ever heard of a pizza bag? I highly recommend using one in which to transport the pizzas, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RAINING CATS AND DOGS OUTSIDE
It helps to keep the pizzas warm
And dry
Have I mentioned that the pizza didn't taste good?
I've lived in the neighborhood for going on 15 years, and this unassuming neighborhood pizzaria has been my fave the entire time
I agree with the other comments already posted, but let's cut to the chase: these folks make an outstanding Neopolitan style pie
Possibly the best crust of its type I've ever tasted--just the right balance of crispness and chewyness
The toppings are fresh and high quality
When you get tired of trendy, expensive thin-crust joints like John's, Pizza Park is the perfect alternative
And be sure to try the garlic knots!
Excellent fresh pizza with regular and whole wheat crust available
All vegetable, and a wide selection of choices available
Ray Bari has better sauce than just about any other standard pizza place in the city
It's such a small difference (it's a tad sweeter than the cookie cutter sauce of nearly every other pizza joint), yet it's the difference that continues to make this my favorite pizza in New York City!
This is a 10 pizza place! The best sauce, huge slices and a taste that can not make you stop on just one slice
If you love pizza and missed this place, you are doing yourself an injustice
Based on past reviews, I was hesitant, but decided to go for an anniversary dinner
Although the service was slower than it should have been, the food and the ambiance made up for it
We had a very romantic evening, and one of the busboys went out of his way for us
We also felt the price was very reasonable for the overall dinner, dessert and all
I was so excited to show a friend from out of town my favorite place in the city
I felt like crawling under the table by the end
Our waiter failed to turn in our order, took two hours to get it to us and then we had to send it back because it was wrong
After the rude attitude and snap of sharp words from him, the waiter at the table next to us apologized for the service and quickly did everything he could to make our experience delightful
but at that point, McDonald's was sounding good
Even tables around us were complaining of the original waiters attitude and service
Many left the place
I want to commend the 2nd waiter for his assistance
I will recommend this place, but suggest a quick change of waiters if the attitude is too much
Had a surprise birthday party and it went off w/o a hitch! From maitre d' Johnny, to the Gondolier Andres, to our servers Bill and Christy, they exceeded my every wish- it was 90+ and humid, but that didnt keep them from making the evening perfect
Food was excellent the scenery, as always, was perfect
I found them to be perfect team you need to pull this sort of thing off
Thank you Rebecca, Dave and all who helped make it a wonderful surprise!
Was taken for brunch on the 4th July
It was hot sticky, but I loved it
Service was good the food
Clams were yummy the tuna club sandwich
My Sunday Brunch at the Parkview was a decent to good experience
I can see why people would experience problems with the place
The wait staff is not very refined or polished, but the view is one of the best in the city
The food, was okay and the selection for Brunch was a little short
Pancakes got rave reviews and the Lobster Salad Special was just okay
Other tables ran the gamut from happy looking well served people to those who were furious with their waiter
My party must have rolled a seven because we had a pretty good experience
Will I be back, probably not
Would I recommend that people try the place at least once, sure
It's getting harder to find restaurants like this in New York
If it isn't some theme place, it's another faux french brasserie
Yes, there can be problems with the service, many of the waiters failed the airline telephone agent exam in Bangalore, I'm assuming, and wound up here as a second choice
Yes, there will be nights when you are the youngest one here, even though you're 62 years old
But the crowd does get younger the later you show up, everyone is well dressed and behaved
No screaming kids like the ones that ruin Bubby's in Tribeca (a first cousin to this place)
Burgers are my favorite here, and the Asian cold noodles are good too
According to the manager, their lease runs till 2067
but just to be sure, I'd hurry there before it morphs overnight into a Cosi or Chipotle
I've been to the restaurant twice and enjoyed it both times
The space is arranged very nicely so that diners don't feel crowded and even when the restaurant is busy, there are still tables and the it's not too noisy
The first time was for brunch where I sat outside in the back patio - a lovely atmosphere
The vanilla french toast is wonderful and the portions are quite large
The second time I went for dinner; I was not disappointed
The salmon was fresh, cooked well, and presented very nicely
My dinner partner ordered the angel hair with seafood - the portion was easily big enough for two
The service is pretty average but the food, portions, and space make up for that
one of the reasons i go there besides the food and the ambiance is the bartenders,specially JULIAN the nice guy with a sexy acent they should create a new show and call it metropolitan cafe instead of cheers thats how nice and cool this place isand i think this guys (bartenders) have a lot to do with it i go there every week and JULIAN knows my drink ,my name,

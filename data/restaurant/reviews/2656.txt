Okay, the staff's not the most friendly
The brunch is great though! It's a nice neighborhood spot, great for a casual date or bite to eat
While some claim to love this spot for its ellaborate dog theme, the dose of dog ambiance is actually comfortably minimal
What is enticing is the casual , local-dinner-with-an-edge feel
a perfect spot for a sunday brunch with your girlfriends
Great coffee, classic to creative omletes, and wonderful atmophere, this resturant is ideal
I had a decent chicken sald w olives, red peppers, and croutons
There are always dog lovers here
Our Yorkie loves to sit and play while we eat
Try to get an outside seat especially in the summer
This cute little neighborhood cafe/dessert store is owned by Guy Pascal, the pastry chef of La Cote Basque in the 1960's
It's a lovely place to stop for a coffee and sweet
They also serve sandwiches and light lunches
Every neighborhood should have a place like thisl
This truely is THE best neighborhood Italian food you can get in NYC
Not yet Babbo or Lupa, but close
I'm talking about spending $50 for 2 and have a great meal + wine
The place is cramp, but the service food make up for it
I dont' know why the previous poster says the portion is small
I guess if you're looking for Olive Garden style, this ain't it
But the portion is much better than most places
This is the BEST KEPT SECRET on UES, and I hope it'll stay this way forever
This restaurant serves up some of the smallest portions of food possible
For an appetizer I ordered the hot antipasto was shocked to find one shrimp, one clam, one muscle one stuffed mushroom on the dish
Save your money and go somewhere else
Mama Carino was tired of putting her neices and nephews into business (she's probably related to 12-15 owners) after she taught them how to cook
She decided to open her own place and has been doing it right for several years now
She's still around, this 4 ft nothin old Itallian lady yelling in the kitchen, schmoozing with the patrons
If your looking for true sicilian style food, this is the place
Momma Carino makes this place truely special
I brought out of towners to the restaurant and they can't stop talking about it
The dishes and ambiance are fancy, but that's what makes the place soo good
Give it a try you won't be disappointed
I've been about 5 or 6 times and think it is pretty good
It is good for a nice italian weeknight meal
And I think the portion size is fine
As if Americans need a bigger portion size! Service is always good
I have enjoyed many authentic meals in Mama's dinning room
Any one that has complained about the food, doesn't know good sicilian food
Because this is the best, you can not find some of the thing on the menu anywhere else
This is truley home cooking at it best, in a small restaurant
It reminds me of my Grandmothers cooking and she was from Sicily
If you want to get some good Italian food and not have to go way out of your way, this is your place
Granted it isn't the finest of food, they still do a wonderful job providing one with good selection and fair pricing
Mama Carino is still going strong in the kitchen of this delightful neighborhood gem
I haven't lived on the Upper East Side for 5 years, but traveled 80 blocks north to see if the veal speidino was as great as I remembered it
It was
This is not the hippest place around, but then it's not trying to be
It's about the food and this place gets it right
Red checkered table cloths, brick walls, and old pictures from Italy are the decor
Prices are fair
Worth a try
This restaurant is the BEST
The food is the best Italian food we have had in the city, the service is attentive and friendly and the ambiance is extremely comfortable
Don't miss the fresh mozerlla with prociutto and roasted peppers, or the homemade manicotti
My fiance and I tried Carino last night after walking by it for years
We were seated immediately by Mama
The appetizers were tasty and we were looking forward to the entrees
The stuffed shells were mediocre, but the veal was downright terrible
The breading was soggy and saturated with the oil it was apparently deep-fried in (which carried the taste of everything else that was fried in it)
There were maybe two tablespoons of marinara spread along the edge of this disaster, which was not enough to kill the oily taste
Also, the waiter's accent was so unintelligible that we really didn't understand his recitation of the specials or beer list
I was disappointed and will not return
i'm a student and the night manager hates students, or those people that chose to stay for over an hour
he's been extremely rude to me and when i asked him for the name of the owner or his supervisor so i could complain he didn't give it to me
However, if you can avoid this guy, i think the place is fantastic
It's never crowded, except for Sunday Brunch, and there's plenty of seating
the day managers are extremely nice and i've always recieved excellent service during the day by the servicers, managers, and bus-boys
It's a great NY diner
but, if you plan on bring a book and staying there any longer than an hour at night, go down the street a couple blocks elsewhere
Even though I'm a low-maintence, friendly customer, this night manager is a bear
If you live in the neighborhood and are looking for a great diner to call your own, this is it
The staff quickly adopt the regulars and are very friendly
Of course, the law of diners still applies
For best food stick with burgers, breakfast, sandwiches, soups and salads
Being a good tipper really pays off with service
If you want your bacon cooked well, you must ask for it but the fries are great
The prices are about normal
For two you can expect to spend around $25 including tip
THe place is almost never too crowded
I thought this place was going to be a lot more expensive but the food is reasonable and realllly good
I feel like you could even take a date there
;) It's my favorite Italian place on the upper east that's reasonably priced with good food and service
:)
I've been going to Eccola for a few years now, it's 2 blocks from where I live, so,why not? You have to admire a place like this
The pasta you had there in 2000 (an loved it) will taste the same in 2005
It is not fancy, but the staff there gives you an honest service,very polite and attentive, and the food is simple but yet well prepared
It's cheap, so you can avoid the early bird $9
95 dinner, because the crowd is too noisy
I find $ 6
50 for a glass of wine a bit too much, and also they used to make their own bread(not anymore), but overall, I recomend Eccola
My parents actually dated at Ecco-la, so for us it is a family tradition
The food used to be much better, but it is -by far- the best in the area, the service is excelent, the wait staff is friendly and attentive, as for ambience, the place seems trapped on the late 80's
Worth a visit, even if only for the Cheers factor
If this place were free, I wouldn't even consider it
The food is inedible, service is terrible and the decor is so cheesy and awful
Overall, a horrendous experience
The food is not even that cheap and nothing should be this bad
If you have any taste buds at all or feel like wasting money then this is the place for you!
The pasta dishes here are great

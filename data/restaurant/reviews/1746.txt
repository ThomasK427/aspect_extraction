The cup cake (a chocolate cake in a coffee cup topped with real cream) was one of the best desserts I've ever tasted! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive
The food was EXCELLENT!!! However, the seating is extremely tight
The tables are literally separted by 6-8inches
It so uncomfortable
Our waiter literally took 40 minutes to bring our food and we were only a party of 2
She never offered apology nor did she provide an explanation to why parties seated after us where already on dessert
If you go to Maroons
don't go to socialize, mingle
etc
Just go to eat
The food was fantastic
cramped and all
I could never loose my appetitie at Maroons
only my patience
Overall they have proved that amazing food in the worst conditions can still keep you coming for more
I went here recently on a Sat
afternoon with a small group for brunch
Great, attentive service and solid portions (I had fish, a friend had chicken and waffles, and my mom had shrimp)
For the record, I love seasoned (even slightly salty) food
However, my whiting entree was overly salty
I didn't say anything til the end of the meal, so as not to color anyone's experience--turns out everyone's main dish was heavily salted (like mistakenly seasoned 3 or 4x salty)
There was still lots good about Maroon's, including a fantastic red velvet cake served warm with a glaze that has the mildest twinge of rum in it
I would return, but definitely tell them: easy on the Mrs
Dash!
1st I have to start by saying that it was the Sunday of Memorial Day Weekend and New York was practically deserted except for the sailors-that being said Maroons offers quality food for those seeking an upscale west-indian/soul food restaurant
The cornbread and collards needs some improving, but the jerk wings (not wingetts) were spicy in a good way my hubbies ribs were tender
The curry goat was meaty and they serve a golden brown 1/2 fried chicken
Overall feel free to check it out
For $67 (no alcohol, just DG) I could have gone to the around the way spot on Flatbush Ave ? spent $15 and been just as happy
So


I am in town, and always looking for a great southern restaurant
I chose Maroons, made a reservation and waited and waited and waited
But


I now I am sitting here, absolutely STUFFED and SATISFIED
One gripe - and it is a BIG one for me: the hostes was N-A-S-T-Y
I was so disappointed
The waitstaff and bartenders definitely made up for it
I wish I would've gotten her name, because I would definitely avoid any night she is working
Anyway, I will return, and get my eat on!
If you like bland dry food, poor service, and expensive prices
I am from South Carolina, and my wife's from Jamaica, and Let me tell you, this is not Jamaican or southern food
Highly not recommended
Do not waste your time or your money on this one
Maroons is all hype
I arrived with 3 other friends because this restaurant was highly recommended to us
We were all very disappointed
The fried chicken had NO flavor, collar greens were bland
The mac and cheese, if you want to call that mac and cheese was just down right awful
I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone
Each time we have been to Maroons we are always pleased! The food first and foremost is true comfort food yet with a flair that sets it a part from anywhere else we have been
Always flavorful with eye popping portions
( great value) The servers are fun, energetic and knowledge, helping us to work our way through the extensive menu
Although crowded most nights and sometimes a wait- it's always worth it in the end
I guess it's crowed for a reason
Maroons is just that good!
The Matre'd seated us 50 minutes after our reservation and the crowd was unbearably loud
Towards the end of the dinner, when we confronted the manager in a reasonable way about the noise and the fact that there was no apology after seating us so late, he simply walked away with not one word - basically telling us to shove it
Now, we are long time New Yorkers who've been to fine restaurants like Spice Market, Kittichai etc
just to name a few, we've never seen poor service like that from a restaurant
One of us thought that if you are not of a certain ethnic background, you are not treated well
Collard greesn, macaroni cheese, sweet potato pie
mmmm
This resaurant hits the mark on all of that
The food is so delicious, comforting and has it's one uniquely addictive flavor
Try the jerk chicken wings and you'll be un love
The staff however is unattentive and just doesn't seem to care and being helpful
In all fairness I've only been there once maybe the waitress was having an off night
Still go here for the food don't overeat so you can try the dessert!
I've eaten here a couple times and the food is always good (jerk chix wings, fried chicken, meat loaf, etc) but the service is terrible
Tonight was the worst experience by far
We waited only about 10 minutes to be seated, so I was surprised (it usually takes longer)
After the waitress took our order the first time, she came back 10 minutes later and asked to take our order again
That was the warning sign
Then we waited 45 minutes before the first item of food showed up
And it was wrong
At that point we were fed up and left
Either order take-out or go early
The first time I went here the food was really really good
The second time I went there I ordered the same thing and the food was just ok
A month later I saw the Hostess at another restaurant and shared a few words with her
I told her that the food wasn't so great my second time there, and she said they changed a chef
Despite my last experience I thought I would schedule a company group dinner here
I called to make the reservation and was told that the message would be handed to the owner and she would call me back
the next day I still hadn't recieved a call, and so the day after that I called again and left another message
It has been 5 days now and I still havent recieved a call from the owner
I would not reccommend this place to anyone
Some friends and I went to Maroons and spent 1 hour waiting for our entrees, after waiting 30 minutes to be seated - even though we had a reservation
They gave away our table because they thought we were adding several people on
Well, we explicity told them that the new arrivals could be seated at the bar if it was a problem
They obviously misunderstood, and before we knew it, we were waiting
and waiting
They ended up cramming 10 of us on 3 small tables, then taking forever with our food
TThere was one guy (the manager?), who was very unapologetic about the service
The food was good, but not great
Since the service was so poor, we asked if they could offer any concessions - complimentary drinks? Nope, and to top it off, we were charged a 20% gratuity because we were a group
I won't go back

If you have to eat there to see and to be seen, you can do that
but DON'T GO THERE FOR FOOD
it is kind of place where fashion-followers would go, because they would not have the real taste
Fantastic place!! Blood orange mojitos, awesome!! Black pepper shrimp is my favorite!! Everything has clean and spicy flavors, but not overpowered as you can taste every ingredient
Flavors just burst in your mouth
Place is fun and vibrant
A must try
Ask for the Cosentino Wine called the Poet, it will go with all your food and keep up with the spice
Good place in the meatpacking district
When all places around are getting so tacky, this place still manages to be cool and nice
Wow! What a lovely meal I had at Spice Market last week! The 3 of us ordered much of the menu and shared, in keeping with their practice of bringing dishes to the table as they are cooked and setting them in the center
The ginger rice (with a fried egg on top!), lime noodles, cod with chili sauce, crispy squid salad, spring rolls and chicken curry were all delicious
The only slightly sour note was dessert
I loved the lemon ginger ice cream (though my fellow diners did not), but the banana ovaltine brulee was a BIG mistake
The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, service impeccable, although the crowd is a little self-consciously trendy for my taste
Prices were MUCH lower than I anticipated
A new favorite!
The ambience is nice, the whole place is vaguely reminescent of ABC Carpet Home: a mix of Asian themes
The cuisine is based on Vietnamese dishes (apparently)
The choices for vegetarians are extremely limited, unless one is content with side dishes
I guess if you are interested in showing off your newest trendy clothes and checking out other people who are doing the same, then you'll have a good time
Also good if you want to impress your date
They always fully booked
Finally had a chance to try
Great environment and seating
Very comfortable
Place is hugh
Food is average
But worth trying
Would recommand for group party
Spice Market has the most delicious cocktails and is a beautifully designed space
The dramatic bi-level space looks like it was imported directly from Asia
Although it's usually packed beyond belief, the staff is very gracious and accomodating
The food I tried was good, and the bar scene is hopping - my group of friends had a lot of fun
It's quite a scene - great for people watching and socializing
Spice Market has been at the top of my must try list for quite some time - which made my experience last night all the more disappointing! We thought the food was completely sub-par - so spicy that the dishes left nothing to the imagination
Instead of enjoying subtle flavors, we were left chugging water
I realize some dishes are meant to have heat, but that was ALL these dishes had
To top it off, our server rushed us through our meal
In the future, I will only go to Spice Market to enjoy their cocktails (very good) and ambiance (well done)
I don't know where all of these negative reviews are coming from
I guess a lot of it depends on where you are seated, what you order, and who is serving you
I thought everything was great
The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all top notch
Make sure to order the squid dish as your appetizer!
Now I know why the place is packed
Had reservation for 10pm on a Monday night
The appitizers came and went and there was like a 30 minute break before the entree arrives
No wonder you can never get reservation for this place, the food takes forever to come
Everyone has to be there atleast 2 hours for dinner!! And it's ironic that the place is called Spice Market when the food is so bland
The waitress are terrible, not very attentive at all
The decor was so so
The music is a little loud which makes people talk even louder so the place is kinda noisy
Not really a good place for a date
Beautiful dining room + hottest location (with famous name attached)
Expensive, of course, but it's the whole experience that you pay for
I enjoyed it, though I agree, if you don't care about the scene and just want to have good Asian food with nice wine (or sake), there are many other choices in New York
unless you're not going to eat, that is
The food is not impressive for what one expects going into a Jean Georges restaurant and thusly, should be priced more accordingly
It's good alright, it's just not THAT good
The waitstaff is really ridiculous too; could they be more pseudo-Euro??? Please
Go downstairs to the gorgeous and decadent lounge-y area and drink fabulous cocktails and take in the beautiful teak architecture and good looking folk

Heard lots about this place and worked hard to get even an early reservation
Decor and styling all excellent, very trendy crowd etc
Food was good and they had some awesome drinks (of the $12 variety though)
Big complaint was the service/attitude
True to we are hot now and don't care format for new/hot dining places, the service was very attentive but only looking to make that extra buck and rush us out of there
We felt very rushed the entire meal
Clearing tables before finishing last bites
Had 1/3 of a $12 drink cleared from table, only to be argued with by the waiter when I complained
Was fun experience but won't go back
Not worth it
I dined at Spice Market twice
Once for my birthday with my husband and once for lunch with about 5 other coworkers
While the atmosphere is really impressive, I really don't think the food lived up to the hype
Don't get me wrong
It was good -- especially the braised pork appetizer
But I guess I was expecting great
Maybe it's that whole high expectations phenomenon that often happens with movies you've just got to see -- when you end up leaving a little unsatisfied, wishing you got what everyone else did out of it
That's how I felt leaving Spice Market
went in on a sunday afternoon without reservations
we were told the restaurant was booked, but the hostess contacted me 5 minutes later and told us she had moved some tables around and created a small space for us
while i was skeptical, when we were showed our tabe, the place was in fact full, and the waiter and bus boy were still arranging our table
after we were seated, the waiter then explained to us all of dishes, and told us which were spicy, and which were his personal favorites
the ginger friend rice is beyond amazing, and the chicken dish we had as our entree was also delicious and quite large
the chicken satay appetizer was a bit dry, but overall, acceptable
the cocktails are phenomonal
the service was excellent and friendly
would recommend this place to anyone looking for something different
I have heard so much hype about this place, however after going there the other night I don't believe the hype, well at least food wise
As far as a cool, trendy, great bar scene, beautiful people, celeb hangout type bar cool restaurant atmosphere this is it
It was phenomenal in that regard
And the design of the building creates a very cool ambience
However, the food was totally average at best
The waiter told us that they would be serving our food as when it was ready (not all at once) so they could serve it hot
OK, whatever sounds good
Yet my steak was luke-warm at best, my friend's too
And the appetizers, were just average nothing to write home about

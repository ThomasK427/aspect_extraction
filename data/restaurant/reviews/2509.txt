I grew up in NY and I cannot find a good slice anymore! I follow the scent to anywhere that is advertised as old school but this place was disappointing
There is no flavor to the sauce, no spices at all, the crust was underdone and the cheese was put on sparingly
I watched the guy make the pizza and I could see there was not enough cheese on it
Where oh where can I find a slice in this town that is actually good!!!!
This is by far the best pizza out there
I've been eating their pizza for the last 2 years, and I can't eat anyone else's pizza now without being disappointed
I don't know why other reviewers are calling the staff rude
Just shoot them a smile and they will talk your ear off
Truely a New York experience
I've been having a passion for food ever since I started cooking at age 4
I consider myself to be a person with exceptional tastebuds, easily recreating food I eat out
I had pizza here and enjoyed it, but it is a far cry from the hype that exists about the place
It is definitely overrated and undoubtedly OVERpriced!  Nothing special, I make a far better pizza myself
This is the best
Made by guys who take pride in what they do
They make one pizza at a time so it isn't sitting around all day
It's done right and the sauce and the dough aren't made in a factory
The cheese is real
The neighborhood has changed over the years but these guys haven't
I hope they never retire and live to outlast me
I live in the upper west side and was very happy when I read the reviews as most of the highly recommended pizza parlors are in other parts of the city
Decided to buy a large pie for football sunday - pizza almost ruined my football sunday!  Highly overrated pizza
The sauce is way too salty and crust was a bit undercooked
Threw out the pie and ordered another one from another local pizza parlor
I'm not sure who's writing the other reviews
The only thing I agree with is the rude service
That's fine and acceptable if the pizza lived up to the hype
Take my advice - go somewhere else
Bar none, this is the best pizza you'll ever have the privilege of eating
I used to live two blocks from Sal's and Carmine
A couple of years ago, I moved to midown and I STILL travel uptown for a pie (I take a cab home with it - my own delivery service:)
and i am so glad they are on the list!!! my once a week indulgence and SIN --
We just got back from our first real trip to New York and I tried 4 or 5 different pizza joints and this place was unbelievable
It is just a tiny little place, but the pizza was UNBELIEVABLE
It is quite a ways uptown, but worth it
It was the best piece of pizza I have ever had and my wife who really doesn't even like pizza thought it was outstanding
I have been eating Sal's Pizza for about 50 years
He was first down on 95th St
Next what was then the Symphony movie theater
I don't believe there was any seating
There was always a wait
The pizza was always fresh
Then he moved uptown and became Sal Carmine's, but in all that thime the pizza has never changed, nor has the service
It is the quintessential NY experience
The slices are large with just the right sweet and saltyness encluding the oil that runs down the slice
I have enjoyed many of New York's pizza parlors, but none ever come close to the perfection on Sal Carmine's
This is what is a little of what is left of NY and especially the Westside before a generation of trendiness took over
YES, THE TWO OLD MEN CAN BE RUDE AND MEAN AT TIMES BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN YOU BITE INTO THEIR SLICE
THEIR ATTITUDE IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE
LOL! I JUST RECENTLY DISCOVERED IT THROUGH A FRIEND AND I'VE LIVED IN NYC ALL MY LIFE AND HAVE NEVER TASTED A BETTER PIZZA
THE SAUCE IS JUST DELICIOUS, HAS A TASTE LIKE NO OTHER
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
BUT DON'T EXPECT GREAT FRIENDLY SERVICE OR A TRENDY LOOK JUST EXPECT GREAT PIZZA!
I don't care how good the pizza is here
Everytime i try to grab a quick slice it is never quick and the counter staff is rude
I agree their slice is decent, but I refuse to wait 15 minutes for a slice when their are so many other great places to eat in the neighborhood
I have been eating their pizza for well over 20 years as a young schoolboy and remember when it was only 50cents a slice
Here I am an adult and everytime I smell that aroma coming from their pizza store, not only does it stop and make my mouth water but it reverts me instantly to a time where that slice of pizza was the highlight of my day
20 years later there are days when it still is
I've lived here for six years and I've had pie in all five boroughs and this really IS the single best cheese pie slice I've ever had
My friends and I ordered the entire pie and ate it in about five minutes, it was so good
Perfect tomato sauce, get the large for the thinnest crunchiest possible crust
I put this on must do list, and finally tried this place today
It is a hike but since I visit NYC via Penn Station it was simple to get to by 19 subway
The pizza was just splendid
I had a plain slice and one with sausage, and if all they served was plain, that would be no problem with me
It's great they sell by the slice since I usually travel alone
I was the second one served today, so it could not have been more fresh or hotter, and that is the way they want it to be since they don't deliver
They open at Noon so don't expect an early lunch
Great pizza
Addictive
I was craving for a good pizza to share with my kids
I surfed the net and came upon sal's and carmines
I got the pleasure of seeing sal himself in action
the dough was abit too chewy and the pizza was way too salty
the sauce was excellent but the saltiness of the pizza quickly overpowered anything good about the pizza
Being raised on Sal Carmine's Pizza means that I have an informed opinion on the matter
Sal Carmine are quietly industrious
I have always loved watching them make pizza and if you do get a chance to observe them at their craft, take the opportunity to close your eyes for a brief moment and listen to Sal and Carmine have a subtle Italian conversation in the background, while they gracefully toss the sweetly oiled dough; take in the aroma of the well seasoned sauce and freshly cut cheese
Too bad I'm in Florida or I'd ask the guys, Lemme get 2 da go!
For me, Sal and Carmine's is the best slice in the states
The cheese is the zestiest, the sauce, sublime
Everyone in NYC needs to try it out if they haven't yet
You can't get beer or wine, unfortunately, but they do have fountain drinks and orangina!
I absolutely love this pizza
This is absolutely what one thinks of when one thinks of New York Pizza
So good!
Quite possibly the worst pizza in the city - greasy, salty, and chewy
I came because of the positive reviews on cityseach, but was severely disappointed
Pizza the way it should be
Fresh cheese, great sauce, excellent crust
One of the tastiest ever encountered, quite possibly the most addictive
Simple
Pure
Go here
Try it
Love it
The BEST slice of pizza in town!! If you are in the neighborhood, or even if you are not
it's worth stopping by for the cheese pizza
Ok, so this place is literally a hole in the wall, around the corner where I live

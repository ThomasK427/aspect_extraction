Frankly, I hate to point out the obvious, but La Goulue is located on Madison in the East 60s
I don't know why reviewers seem shocked at the type of clientele that frequent the restaurant
Many NYC places are crowded, with rushed service and preferential treatment to regulars/famous people, during peak dining hours
Why not try this place for a late weeknight dinner? We went and had a fabulous experience - attentive waiters, great table, wonderful food, knowledgeable sommelier
I would definitely go back
The salade gourmande is delicious!
It seems from the other reviews that either you love this place or you hate it---no in-between
I happen to have hated it
I think the food was superb, but the atmosphere and prices kept me from fully enjoying it
I didn't appreciate being seated in the back of the restaurant, far away from other diners
No, I wasn't dressed all in Prada and Gucci, but I did look nice
I also did not appreciate being charged $9
00 for water
I was scanning the region's listings for a place for dinner tonight, and was surprised to see this place has no ratings
Classic French restaurant
Great food, great service
We ate outside, but I did pop inside for a second, and loved the decor
Not hip or cuting edge, more out of the 40's
Thank goodness I wasn't picking up the bill, because it can be pricey, but not over the top, and definitely worth it
Furthermore, it wasn't pretentious, despite being chock full of the beautiful people
Disclaimer: I ate there several months ago
I visit this restaurant often when I go uptown and I must say that usually it is just so so, but I loved it yesterday
The brandade was the best I have had in the city and our simple lunch was just delectable
What's the story , is there a new chef? I loook forward to my next visit uptown
If your idea of sophistication is being snobbed because you don't speak fluent contemporary parisian French, this is the place for you
It is a crowded madhouse at noon
Preferential treatment to the mink clad, Gucci/Pucci wrapped is all to obvious
(No, I wasn't wearing dirty sneakers and a t-shirt
) Did not have a change to sample the food because our reservation was not found
One of our all time favorites for food, service and old world ambiance
And the people watching isn't shabby either
La Goulue was one of the WORST dining experiences of my life
This restaurant is unbearably loud, unnecessarily dark, and packed like a subway car during rush hour
On top of that, the food is mediocre flavorless and the service is terrible
The crowd is comprised of every bad Upper East Side stereotype: sleazy old men with their barely legal dates, women with painfully obvious facelifts and painfully expensive jewelry, and jobless trust fund boys wearing Gucci loafers without socks
HORRIBLE!
It seemed to me that there were a lot of servers running aound at Maruzzella
I'm not sure where they were all going since the place was on the quiet side
As it turned out they were making sure everyone was taken care of and service was good, maybe almost a little too nudgy
My date and I had the trecolore salad, ceasar salad, seafood salad, tagliatelle bolognese and brocolli rabe side
All were good
The bill came to $56 (+ $31 extra for drinks) for a $95 total
Although better italian food might be found elsewhere, this was a charming, well-run place with good food and I understand why 'hood locals frequent it regularly
I would return (even with the average rating)
I visited for the first time this past weekend, after reading some great reviews on citysearch
And was glad to see that everyone was right
yum!! A great night out - service was friendly and attentive and the food was fabulous
We shared a great stuffed mushroom appetizer and both had veal dishes
I am glad I live close by because I'll definitely be back!!
I LOVE this place! I go here all the time! Outdoor seating is great for people watching
Food is excellent, and the service is great
Will be offering extra seating in the coming months
Disappointing
The host was extremely short when seating us - but that was just the beginning - the waiter was terrible, maybe saw him twice the whole night, and when we did he made it clear that he was doing us a favor
The busboys tried to compensate for this embarrassment (they were good) - but it couldn't rescue the meal
Food was ok - not as good as we had heard, but maybe we were a bit put off by the service
We won't be back
I went there to celebrate my fiancee promotion
I had fabulous grilled calmari w/ greens and an amazing wide fettucine with red tomato cream and mozzarella
Amazing
We had 2 bottles of wine and some limoncello, and chocololate pecan pie
It came out to $140, but if you cut out the wine, a great dinner for aboiut $85
Great service, at a quaint place
It is so difficult to choose a favorite on the menu, because the bolognese, the salmon, the chicken with mushroom, and the telephono are all too good to rank
The same is true for the appetizers, such as insalata di mare and porcini mushrooms
The ambiance is warm and friendly
Plus, the owner and the waiters tell good stories
It is like being with good friends
Very, very good service at this teeny little place on the upper east side
Very good veal dishes
Appetizers were oily, but tasty none-the-less
Try it!
I can't count the times I've been here
It's easily my favorite restaurant on the Upper East Side
Their pasta is fresh and each special I've ordered has been wonderful
They're accommodating with dietary needs and very easy going
The lasagna and bolognese sauce win raves from my carniverous friends, while the simple peppardelle al telefono always makes me happy
it's quiet and feels comfortable any time of the day, and I've walked in at Midnight on a weekday to dinner service without any hassle or rush
Go! I promise you'll enjoy it
marruzala's is a warm and comfortable place with a professional staff who attend to your every need like a traditional Italian bistro
The food is perfect after a hard day of mediocre, corporate fare
I always feel as if I've eaten well, a home cooked meal with the appropriate flair to make it a treat
The owner's are sweethearts, wine flows and dessert is perfecto
my girlfriend and I went last Saturday night
We decided to walk around our neighborhood, instead of going to our usuals, strolled upon Maruzzella and left incredibly impressed
By far one of the Italian restaurants I have been to on the upper east side
Definitely will return and often
Great prices to
Very quaint and the setting is just right
A+++ Service was a little slow
went here with my wife specifically loking for a place where we could with with a bottle of wine at a quiet corner in the back and just relax and enjoy the food a talk
we got exactly that
split an appetizer of mozzarella and peppers and tomatoes that was very fresh
i had linguine w/ white clams, she had rotolo
we shared excellent tiramisu
nobody asked us to leave, nobody offered a check
we got two plus hours of great food and conversation
will return often
The Scene Spring Break never ends at Brother Jimmy's, a rowdy post-collegiate hangout where the air smells sweetly of stale beer and the chipper waitresses look like Hooters imports
The modus operandi here is simple: to drink and eat as much as humanly possible

Go early because it gets VERY crowded
Waitstaff is rushed but pleasant
Order the watercress salad! The watercress is lightly battered and deep fried
Delicious!  Just take the #7 train to either 61st or 69th street
Note that the restaurant is closed on Wednesdays
This is a great Thai place, my wife and I discovered by chance
We are both Thai food lovers and this place tops our list
Seating might be a little inconvenient but you'll be glad in the end
This restaurant ranks #1 for my wife, born and raised in Udon Thani (Northern) Thailand
She's been in the NY area for just about a year, and we've tried about 7 or so of the top rated restaurants
Only Sripraphai will do for her, and that should say something, since she is Thai afterall
The key word here is authentic
Most Thai restaurants adjust the flavor to better suit American palates
(can't blame them I guess, because patronage pays the bills)
Sripraphai doesn't have to do this, because of the large Thai population that patrons their establishment
My wife gives them a 9 out of 10
(10 is reserved for restaurants in Thailand I think)
GO TO Sripraphai, get N9 and A17
O1 is great too
I've practically grown up with this restaurant
I used to come every sunday with my mother
Sripraphai has pretty darn authentic Thai cuisine
Don't be turned off by the plastic lawn chairs and cramped area
The food is worth it if you appreciate real Thai
The restaurant itself is not much to look at, but the food was delicious
I had the chinese broccoli with salted fish, satay chicken (HUGE strips) and the barbecued pork
In comparison with the other Thai places I've been to, this one rises above them all
I have to admit that it seemed like I was out of place when i first walked in but the waitresses where very nice
I had a blast with the food and drinks
They have the best looking menu books i've seen to date
Pictures of all the dishes and drinks
Please, please, please, watch out for the spicy stuff 'cause the spicey food isn't for the faint at heart or tongue
I made that mistake once even though the meal tasted exceptional
The decor was nothing to brag about but the place is clean and comfortable
They have a photo menu that even shows what the drinks look like, which is a really great help
The food was good I had the ground beef over rice
but I ordered it spicy
I will never do that again
I was tearing the whole time
If you do happen to order your food spicy I recommend the iced coffee with milk to cool your tounge (it also taste really good
better than Starbuck's)
The service was ok, but you will have a better time getting the waitresses attention if you speak the language
This restaurant clearly has the best Thai food in New York
Try the things that you will not find in the cookie cutter Thai restaurants that you would find in Manhattan
Hoy Tod (Mussel Pancake), Sai Grob Essan (Eastern Thai Style Sausage), Nua Dat Deuw (Fried Beef), and Tendon Soup are a few of my favorites
Stay away from the Pla Chu Chee (Fried Fish with a chili sauce) this was way to dry and overcooked
Top off with a dessert of Mango with Sweetened Sticky Rice , if they have it
You will not be dissappointed here, because this is the place that Thai people go when they feel homesick
i've been going here since the place opened and even before it moved to the present location
to be honest, the food quality has changed a lot over the years
i noticed that almost everything is taken out of the fridge and popped into the microwave, for example it seems that most of the curries are served this way
though the food is still ok, it isn't at all what it once was
the waitstaff is nice, curt at times but the service is ok
prices are very reasonable which is a plus
but i miss the Sripraphai of yester-years
This has to be the best Thai restaurant in Manhattan
Their Chicken Green Curry dish is DELICIOUS
A must try, but not for those who can't stand spicy foods
I also recommend the chinese broccoli with crispy pork dish
Do not get the pad kee mow (wasn't as good as Montien's)
I lived in S
F
for years, and this is still my favorite on this continent
Favorites include the Curry Shrimp w/ Mushrooms, Watercress Salad (not listed on menu), and Kao Soy noodle soup with chicken
I called to see why my order was taking so long
The person on the other end of the phone said I've been here 20 years, it doesn't matter whether you order here or not
Nasty attitude
Sounded like the owner - if the owner themselves says Don't bother coming here - that's a huge sign to RUN AWAY from the place
Worst attitude, worst service I have found in the area
I could go to the grocery store, buy food take it home and cook it sooner than they can deliver anything
I would not set foot in Pizza Boy or order from there if they PAID me
EVER
There are hundreds of better places, don't waste your time or money with these jerks
And the food is only about average
I've tried the place more than once, worse every time
If they don't give a crap about customers, wonder what are they putting in your food??
my family and I always order from this place - actually for around 15 years now-
they used to have awesome pizza here (really)
nice thin crispy crust and tasty sauce
but then a few months ago, they turned it into a greasy thin foldable pizza which didnt even come close to the old one
What happened????
This place has become my favorite nieghborhood Italian restaurant
Everyone who visits will be blown away with the Penne alla Vodka- sure to be a favorite
The pizza is also high on the list
I highly recommend this place for a cute romantic dinner on weekend nights
DeDona makes the best pizza around
It is crispy, tasty and made the way pizza was ment to be
I am old enough to have had lots of pizza around and Italian enough to know it's excellent
I had moved out of the area and must come into DeDona's for my pizza fix (that is an hour car ride out of the way)
Sure, I can buy pizza where I live, but unfortunately, they only make the run of the mill pizza and not like DeDona's
As a true New Yorker, im always on the run, and when im hungry, pizza is the only thing that can keep up with me
My first hard food was actually pizza, and it was Rosario's Pizza
Till this day i go back to my old neighborhood to have that brick oven pizza, and i will always go back as long as i can chew
CLINTON DINER IS A GREAT PLACE TO GO EAT
I LOVE THEIR 1/2 LB BURGERS, CHICKEN CUTLET PARMESIAN WITH SPAGHETTI, GRILLED CHICKEN, LONDON BROIL AND THEIR BREAKFAST
THEY PROBABLY HAVE THE LOWEST PRICES IN QUEENS
2EGGS WITH HOMEFRIES, TOAST AND COFFEE ARE ONLY $2
08
THAT IS CHEAP AND IT TASTES SO GOOD
THIS DINER WAS FEATURED IN THE MOVIE GOODFELLAS WITH ROBERT DENIRO AND RAY LIOTTA

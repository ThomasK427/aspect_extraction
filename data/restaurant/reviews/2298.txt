I wonder if it was because there were three women from the South dining together, but they didn't mind taking our check for $460++
I've never been so disappointed in my life
Surely it was just a bad night, but it was awful
The food was mediocre at best
I don't understand????
This is THE PLACE! I loved every aspect of Daniel
The decor is fabulous
The food exquisite
The service the ultimate top notch
I think it is impossible to say anything negative about this restaurant
It is definitely something to do before you die
Put it on your list
You will not be disappointed
It is the ultimate in fine dining
At 21 years old, I have eaten at some very nice places, but Daniel is surely the nicest
The hostesses could be models, and the waitstaff is the most efficient I've ever seen--I could hardly take three drinks without someone coming by to top off my glass
I really didn't encounter much snobbery
In fact, oneof the waiters made a joke as he almost overflowed my friend's champagne
Of course the food is out of this world
The meal begins with a tray of canapes, our first courses were great, and my lamb was cooked to perfection
For dessert I had the chocolate souffle
Wow! Daniel's petit fours are amazing too
The bill can get pretty steep with drinks, wine, and dessert wine, but if you are on a budget you can eat at Daniel for not much more than the $88 prix fixe
Enjoy!
It's about the experience: tasting the food, the wine, the ambience
BUT expect to drop $400-500 on a meal for 2
If you're not used to spending this money and only do it once a year or less, then do it for the experience and go all out
People complain that tables are saved for the rich
Well, this is a rich restaurant where rich people are regulars
We experienced no delays, minimal snobbery (what do you expect in a place like this? NO snobbery? They have an image to uphold, it's not Applebee's), and they answered any questions that we had
They even took the wine label off for us and put it in a Daniel's wine label 'book' so we could take it home
The food, service, and ambience were all incredible! My wife and I went to celebrate the sale of our house
At one point, the waiter asked us if we were celebrating anything
We told him that it was just the sale of our house and he smiled and said well, that's a celebration and then walked away
When they brought our desserts to us, they brought out an extra dessert (one we didn't select) that had Congratulations written on the rim! THAT'S service! They realize that it costs them next to nothing to make us feel like we were special
More restaurants need to thing about that
I don't see how anyone could NOT be full at the end of the meal
Remember, this food is not about large portions, its about intensity of flavor
If you want big portions, go to the Olive Garden
a perfect sevice, people are around you, maiking sure eveything is goins as it should, and it does! We enjoyed our diner so much that we highly recommend this place to anyone wishing to have a gourmet diner experience
Ask to be seated in the main dining room, it is wonderful
The food was delicious
I definitely recommend the Sauteed Foi Gras
Overall, the service was wonderful
You leave there feeling nice and full
Very very expensive so make sure you bring your credit card
It was bound to be a good night given the attention to detail when I made the reservation
The reservationist explained the differences between the lounge and main dining hall and made note that it was a special occasion (my boyfriend was presented a dessert with a greeting in chocolate sauce and a discrete candle)
The main dining hall was sumptuous, service was immaculate but not too stuffy, and the food
each selection on the tasting menu was perfect
It cost over twice as much as any other high end restaurant that we had been to
but was we discussed going back as soon as we left
my boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and i was amazed
the service was wonderful and extremely attentive
the tuna tartar and the scallop appetizers were so incredible
this place is definitely one of the best restaurants new york has to offer
Similar to the presentation the wizard gave in that land called Oz
The restaurant is beautiful, the service is well polished, but the food is all smoke and mirrors
The ingredients are all high end, rare and exotic specialty products, but the resulting dishes remain
bland? Insipid? Uninspired? You will leave feeling as if youve had a good meal, but for the presentation you were sold (and paid for!) - the hype, the reviews, the to die for meals the restaurant does not live up to its expectations
Go for the scene, but never expect to feel as if youve had a meal worthy of the price you paid
Daniel is truly and amazing dining experience
Everything from the service, to the food, to the decor is well perfected
I had a tuna tartar, a pasta dish with fresh truffles and the signature dish of short ribs and filet
All three dishes were incredibly delicious and the short ribs were the best I have had
Dining here is well worth the cost and it is not for people who dread long drawn out meals
This restaurant attends to every detail and it makes for the perfect setting for a special occasion
The wine list is also very impressive!
At these prices and the quality of the wonderful food why can't they provide portion size to fit the price
The service is somewhat more snobish than its competitors and surely less helpful
I love the food and the physical ambience but it just misses in making me feel somewhat special on every trip I've made
Not quite Paul Boquise but more convenient
For small town folks visiting NYC for the first time, Daniel would be very impressive
Unfortunately, my wife and I expected a grastromic experience similar to our San Francisco, Paris, Los Angeles and Lyon experience
By French standards, Daniel is a mediocre restaurant
Once you've experienced true French cooking where there is an explosion of flavors, then you continue to compare and search for that same experience
For example, Guy Savoy in Paris delivers the true multi-layer of flavor in the sauces which the French is famous for
In Summary, I would save the $300 we spent (without wine) and go to a smaller, more intimate establishment in New York such as Nello's in Upper East Side or Shelly's on 57th
I just don't see what all the rave is about
Yes, it's a nice atmosphere, and the service is attentive (albeit rather slow) but I just can't justify spending $300 for two on a meal that was average
Appetizers and desert were delicious but for the money, I was expecting a lot more
One of the finest all around restaurants on this side of the Tappan Zee Bridge - would certainly rank in the Top 10 on any travellers must eat list
Extraordinary service -- attentive and competent Extraordinary ambience -- surprisingly romantic Extraordinary taste -- Daniel conitnues to shine
DANIEL IS DEFINITELY A MUST IF YOU HAVE THE EXTRA MONEY
ALTHOUGH ITS EXPENSIVE THE EXPERIENCE IS INCREDIBLE
THE FOOD AND PRESENTATION IS UNIQUE AND THE WINE IS TWO BOOKS LONG
THE DECOR IS LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IN A WHITEHOUSE
AND THE STAFFS ARE ALL MALE AND FRENCH SPEAKING, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FEMALE HOSTESSES AT THE FRONT
OVERALL IT IS A NICE PLACE TO GO TO AND MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS, A BIT PRICEY THOUGH
I WOULD RECOMMEND GRAMMERCY TAVERN IF YOU'RE A BIT LOW ON CASH
FOR THE ULTIMATE WHITE HOUSE DINING EXPEREINCE, GO HERE!
My first dining experience at Daniels was wonderful, the food was wonderful
I will run out of time and space to describe the entire 5 course tasting menu that I enjoyed last night
Few points I would like to make though
For such a highly rated restaurant it DOES fall short on Service, Ambience and if you want to talk about money
Value
There is definitely a crowd of regulars that frequent the restaurant, the VIP, and they are certainely treated differently
The atmosphere is snooty, and so are many of the waiting staff
If you want BEST value, top notch French cuisine, a wine tasting menu to die for, selec cheeses, and the best romantic setting, go to CHANTERELLE!!
very elegant, i expected more for those prices

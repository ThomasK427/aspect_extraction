i've been eating at ollie's since it opened in 1989 up by columbia u
the food at the multiple ollie's locations vary in quality-- the lincoln center area ollie's is definitely my favorite, although the 116th street location does have a special place in my heart
What to say about Ollie's
It's basically the americanized franchised version of chinese restaurants
They offer a quick, clean, and easy dining experience
The service seats you, takes your order, and puts it on ur table
No small talk or pleasantries not out of meaness but just the designs of a well oiled machine
The food is good and offers all the dishes you'd expect to find in a traditional chinese restaurant
Again it's not old school authentic chinese food but it's good and gets the job done
If you're lookin for that authentic chinese taste or the romantic ambience to take a date, expect to be disappointed
But if u're looking for good simple chinese food made easy to order u've found u're place
I've been here several times because it always looks so tempting when I walk by hungry
I'm always disappointed
The service is fast and efficient, but the food is usually bland and drenched in a sauce
Good local place, but nothing exciting
Standouts: hot sour soup, dumplings, sweet sour chicken (very crisp, all white, nice sauce), moo shu pork (get extra pancakes)
Pass: wonton soup (tastes fishy) sizzle platters (not sizzling)
Food comes quick, but service is minimal
They try to get you in and out with little interaction
Don't try to order at the pick-up window at Ollies - the workers behind the counter are mean to customers and quick to deliver an evil stare and an ill-tempered sigh of disgust, unprovoked
They are negligent in alerting customers when an order is ready - you could end up waiting for half an hour while your food is sitting on their counter getting cold
The food is overpriced for what they deliver, the menu is slim for vegetarians, and the food is incredibly oily
This place rates terribly, overall
Ollie's has fairly decent food
They have the best Sweet Sour Chickent that I've tasted so far in NYC
The Atomosphere is comfortable too
Ollie's is an all around good restaurant
Mostly we go there for the great appetizers
Great place for vegetarians
The vegetable dumplings are consistently good
Service isn't great but food is worth it
Fast, cheap, tasty
Not the cleanest place in the world, but a very good value none-the-less
A good place to bring kids - or for college students on a budget
You can't beat Ollie's for a fast, tasty, inexpensive lunch or dinner
Their everything noodle soup and a plate of mixed steamed dumplings with sustain you through the most arduous sightseeing or the longest Broadway production
Service is a little spotty and impersonal but what can you expect in a place this large and busy
You will always be seated promptly and can count on no bad surprises in terms of food quality, service, or cleanliness
I recommend this for budget minded diners or anyone in a hurry
The location is convenient too
Oddly enough, its hard to get some chopsticks!
If you are in a bit of a rush and want chinese food then Ollies is your place
The food is greasy, the service is fast, the wait can be long
If you are dining off peak hours you should be in and out in a short time
The Scene A startling revelation in shiny black lacquer, Shun Lee exudes Asian chic with grand authority
From a bevy of alabaster white monkeys hanging playfully from the bar, to the glowing, fire-breathing dragon wrapped around the length of the dining room, fiery-eyed, sculpted creatures create aesthetic drama
The Food For haute Chinese food, it's among New York City's best
Regional offerings include red-cooked pig's knuckles and oxtails (Shanghai); filet mignon with garlic, scallions and hot pepper (Hunan); duck liver sauteed with Chinese mushroom (Szechuan); and lobster baked with ginger, scallions and black beans (Canton)
Specialties include Beggar's chicken (which requires one-day advance notice), Hunan tripe, and sweetbreads with black mushrooms
Above and beyond your local takeout, expect high prices
Stopped in for dinner and was seated prompty
Wait staff was friendly and helpful which complimented the black/white decor
However this is all that was good about this restaurant
The appetizers were a joke, especially the Dim Sum at $6
50 a pop
Shrimp fried rice alone, with nothing else was 12
95 and my BBQ pork meal came with a baby cup of white rice
I would have been better off driving to one of the local chinese food restaurants in Brooklyn because including toll it would have been cheaper and much more tasty experience
My wife and I dined at Shun Lee for lunch before going to a play at Lincoln Center on February 18, 2006
We were delighted to find such a great restaurant so nearby to the theater
The decor is black and white checked and is striking
The restaurant was quite crowded but the service was professional and prompt
My wife really liked the dim sum carts, which had about 30 different items ,and kept circulating around the room
She enjoyed the shrimp, which were HUGE! as well as the different kinds of dumplings
I enjoyed orange chicken
Though the portion wasn't overly large, it was enough for us to share
An assortment of pineapple, kumquats and lychee topped off a fine lunch
The prices were quite reasonable for such excellent quality
I will definitely eat here again if I have the opportunity
Bad overall
Just went last night and couldn't be more dissapointed
the filet mignon would be better used as a hockey puck in a local street rollerblade game
I don't mind paying up for a good place but the lack of quailty in food, the cheese of the atmostphere, and the clueless service makes you feel like the biggest sucker on earth for sitting there in the first place
Spend wisely and go to someplace worthwhile
I have never less this restuarnt wit anything but a loosened belt and big grin on my face
of course, the Mai Tai's help
The food is excellent, the service attentive and the atmosphere great! If you are looking to order by number, you should pass this one by
If you want a dining experience to write to Mom about, you're in luck!
Excellent quality of ingredients and decor
Too bad the portion sizes are in inverse proportion to the prices
It is like you are paying for the rent and the fancy digs and not for the food
All dishes are overpriced and most are bland
Too bad because the place is like a museum of fine Chinese artwork
Service was rude and perfunctory
Waiters were not only unhelpful, my requests appeared to annoyed them
The spareribs were not only dry and tasteless, when the waiters could not separate them with tongs, they simply served them and walked away
I had to request a knife to sever them
I ordered a dish without red or green peppers, the dish?beef with leeks and hot peppers? was delivered with an abundance of red and green peppers
The waiter set down my companion's meal and didn't return with my dish for some time
The quality of both the food and service has been in gradual decline
I won't be returning in the near future
i'm dumbfounded that this restaurant and its chain was what i used to consider to be the best
reputation can only go so far before loyal customers like myself begin questioning if i'm being robbed, and not so blindly
6/13/03 was a night that i just should have put my money elsewhere because i was disappointed again
i guess this old dog needs to be taught over and over again before giving up on the once great chain
yes, the decor is a good one but its my stomach that shun lee really has to answer to, and its not saying much
lukewarm food, mediocre service but extremely upscaled prices is NOT in their best interest or mine, so i ask you: is shun lee really beyond take out?
For a Chinese food purist as myself, I find it hard to justify going anywhere else outside of Chinatown to get excellent Chinese food
However, my dining experience at Shun Lee has made me a convert
If you want to be treated like royalty, then this is the place

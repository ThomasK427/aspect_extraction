So, I didn't
I visited Magnolia's to pick up a small cupcake for my birthday, as a mini-treat to myself
(It probably had over 590,382 calories, but it was worth it, regardless if I have to spend tomorrow at the gym burning it off!)  Positives: The cupcake was great
It was freshly baked sweet, one of the best cupcakes I have ever had!!   Negatives: I understand this shop is a 'landmark' type of spot, but jeez, they need to renovate or reorganize the area to better accomodate its customers
When I arrived, the store was literally busting at the seams with people
The self-serve cupcake area was swarming with people in need of assistance; the cashier line was also a mess
Overall, the cupcake was bonkers
If you are in the area, make sure to stop! If you are claustrophobic, this store is NOT for you!
Just walk down Bleecker and you'll know when you are close to the Magnolia Bakery when you see the line literally down the block at any given hour of the day
The cupcakes are phenomenal but the item to really get is the banana pudding
And after sampling one of the bakery's deliciously rich cakes, you'll never eat a store boughten cake ever again
Magnolia, while not usually credited with kicking off the cupcake craze, does seem to elicit a certain reverence from patrons
The problem is, as the popularity has grown, the crowds have too, so the cheerful place once conducive to spontaneous visits now requires some forethought and planning to avoid lines around the block
No wonder the staff is often harried and cranky, with people pouring relentlessly into such a tiny space
On nice Saturday afternoons, visitors often wait 25 minutes or more just to get in
Still, there is something satisfying about drooling over the treats behind the counter or picking out just the right cupcake off the tray
But be aware: the cupcakes and, more specifically, the icing, can be sweet (*very* sweet) particularly the chocolate icing, which visitors often leave unfinished
Even so, Magnolia remains a Manhattan institution, and everyone likes to say theyve been there once
Their cupcakes were great, but my icebox cake is much better, which people who are die hard fans of magnolia's have told me
:)
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Magnolia
Magnolia's red velvet cake, wonderfully fresh cupcakes, and icebox pies are so rich and fresh
My mouth is watering at my desk just thinking about it
Their freshly baked goods beat any other local knock-off bakery's items
There are so many choices in New York City
For this very reason, it is not only wrong, it's amazing to me when I run across such pompous, unacceptable service
The cupcakes are tasty but if you really need a cupcake, go to Billy's in Chelsea or for that matter, try the bakery section of Whole Foods
it's actually not too shabby! Service with a smile coupled with an absolutely perfect product can also be found at Balthazar's in Soho, Le Pain de Quotidien, Sullivan Bakery and many more
It's a free market and there's a lot of competition
Shape up on the service, Magnolia!
If I wanted Indy rock record store snobbery, I'd go to Williamsburg, or the CMJ festival
There's no irony here, boys -- I really *do* want a cupcake
Unfortunately, the service (if you can call a cramped self-serve free-for-all service) and the hipper than thou staff (which acts as if there's something akin to a KitchenAid Mix Master attachment stuck up each of their arses) detract greatly from enjoying an otherwise tasty treat
The Magnolia Bakery has the most Yummiest Cupcakes Ever
The icing is so buttery sweet and the cake moist and delicious, and they are pretty too
The pastel color on the cupcakes makes it feel like its Easter all year round
I have even purchased their cookbook and made the cupcakes myself and they taste exactly like the ones made at the bakery, which proves that they are not trying to be stingy with the recipe
I have heard their banana pudding is outrageously delicious, but I have not had a chance to sample it myself
If you are in the area, pick up some cupcakes from Magnoilia, your mouth won't regret it but maybe your thighs will!!!
This place is WONDERFUL when it's not so busy that there is a 20 minute line down the corner
If you see a line, the experience will be more stressful than it's worth
If you happen to catch it when no one else is there, sit down at the table, get a tea and try the coconut cake
Then it will be a very nice moment in time
the place is as big is my bathroom, with people waiting around the corner to get picked on by the staff
one girl called a customer's son weird because he didn't really like sweets
that's so wrong
and the famous cupcakes? the cake was dry and tasteless and the icing was basically colored sugar
and the large hot chocolate was the size of my thumb and had no chocolate in it! were the post teenage trying-to-be-bad kids too hung over to remember that? in conclusion, save yourself the time, stress and money, stay home with a few tablespoons of sugar and lukewarm milk and you've had the magnolia experience
I have to agree with New Yorker and a couple other posts-- I have been a die-hard patron of this place for many years and willingly have walked many miles for their cupcakes (which are still the best in the city)
But last night I visited Magnolia and found a line around the corner and down the street
I didn't mind the wait, but once at the door- a man who i will refer to as the cupcake nazi- rudely ordered people in, four at a time (which explains the line) and yelled: NO FINGER LICKING! when people in line tried the frosting on their own cupcakes and then continued yelling at people to move down
What has happened to this place? Such a shame-soon it will be filled only with tourists
This tiny bakery serves delicious cupcakes from self-service trays
A sign limits your purchase to a dozen per customer because of the demand (and rumors of long lines which we never saw)
The four varieties include combinations of chocolate and yellow cake, and chocolate and vanilla icing
The yellow cake, vanilla iced ones are the best of the lot, very moist but a little crumbly, and have thick pastel colored icing slathered on top
There is no place to have your cake and eat it too, so head to the small park located diagonally across the street with benches and trash cans overflowing with empty boxes as a testament to their popularity
Good key lime pie with gingerbread crust and banana pudding
The cookies are nothing special though
Staff were friendly and helpful!
The hype surrounding Magnolia is definitely warranted
The frosting is smooth and creamy and the cakes are perfectly fluffy and delicious
The shop is cute, and even though there is no seating, you can go across the street to the park and eat your delectable, or walk around the shops
This place is a gem and I will always go back when I visit the city
One of the things I loved about new york city was Magnolia bakery
New Yorkers outside the bakery with big laughs and bigger smiles eating delicious cupcakes was a truly unique New York city experience that reflected the true spirit of our wonderful city
That Magnolia is gone replaced by one that is extremely rude, obnoxious, and abrasive
Unfortunately Magnolia has gotten too big for its britches and is now a turnoff to native New Yorkers
I love this bakery
The ice box cake reminds me of the ones my grandmother use to make
My tip is to bypass the cupcakes and go straight for the desserts in the refrigerated cases
I noticed that a lot of people complain about the staff, but being a regular, I kind of understand why they're like that
I've seen some damn annoying customers
If you come by at night, you'll see plenty of bridge and tunnel trash acting like they own the place
I actually saw a guy harrass a poor cashier girl 'cause she wouldn't put banana pudding on his cake
My girlfriend puts it best -- it's hard to be nice when you get treated like crap all the time
Can't believe the nerve of the staff
Downright rude
And their cupcakes SUCK
Way too sugary and plastic tasting
Stay away
you have been warned
its a great bakery
great cupcakes -- but this place has lines out the door and this is new york I hate waiting on lines to begin with
Amazing Pies and apple tarts
What is the big deal? The cupcakes are good, but great? No
The cake is a little too dry, the icing is too sweet, and the chocolate cupcakes don't taste like chocolate at all
The snotty service doesn't help either
You work in a bakery, man
Easy on the attitude
I visited this quaint little bakery around New Years
yes, the lines tend to be long but when I had that cupcake in my hand and tasted for myself what the brag was about, I was glad that I was patient! I have never had such a delicious cupcake in all my life!!! It was so rich that I could only eat half but was glad that I bought a box of 4 to have in my hotel room for a later endulgement!   There's park-like benches across the street, with few park-like, wooden tables
A nice spot to enjoy every last bite!   When at the register, don't forget to ask for a bottle of water!!!
I was shocked to see the huge line of people waiting outside Magnolia the past two Saturday nights
It is Not worth the wait at all! A few years ago, I mistakingly recommended Magnolia to many people who are now addicted to the banana pudding
Now I know that the pudding at Buttercup is Much better, minus the lines and rude service! Billy's Bakery also has the Best cupcakes in NYC - hands down
All Magnolia has is a prime location - that's it
Billy's and Buttercup are worth the walk or subway ride
I came here over the weekend just to try the cupcakes! The place was crowded with people grabbing the cupcakes, but they were well worth it! Moist cake and great icing! I can't wait to go back to try the banana pudding and cheesecakes
Yummmm!

The menu boasts,as well as the hostess, who I assumed was also the owner, that some pasta were homemade
I orded the homemade cheese and spinach ravioli
The pasta was obviously NOT homemade and the marinara sauce was just unnecessarily spicy
The ravioli were not unlike those you buy at your grocer
After a not really memorable dinner to my shock I was given the check by the owner in order to accomodate more customers
I overheard her telling my waitress not to offer me coffee
The only thing I can say I enjoyed was the service
Unfortunately, a friend of mine has a similar experience
Be careful
These are generous portions
Like Super-size
Although ingreidents are fresh and better for you than Taco Hell or Mc Heart Attach, if you're not careful, the calories from these can catch up with you eventually
Delicious and addictive, the are a great choice for lunch or dinner
Lots of locations around NYC and they deliver too
If you choose to eat in the restaurant, free chips and 3 different types of salsa
2 thumbs up - WAY UP!
You get very generous servings here and the food is pretty good
More than a fast food place, but way less than a restaurant
Points for burrito creativity
Though, how about offering some cervesas?  Try the Bob Marley's Last Burrito
The food is good; not so authentic, though
However, the service is good and fast, and the prices are affordable
There are many options for many vegeterians
These guys are pretty art-y about their burritos
Anyone can make a frickin' burrito at home with any number of creative fixings
The payoff at Burritoville is pretty huge though--great taste combos that justify paying for it in a way McDonalds/Chipotle can't manage
They also claim fresh/organic ingredients are part of the secret
This location has limited and rickety seating, unfortunately, but you've gotta love the classic Mexican movie posters on the walls
3 girls went to catch up on each other lives and really enjoyed this restaurant
We spent 3 hours in the restaurant catching up while eatting delicious Italian food
It was perfect
We didn't feel rushed or unwanted
The waitstaff was really nice and when one of the girls split her water, they rushed to clean it up
The portions were good and a bottle of wine was a great price
I recommend making reservations
They also seemed to have a large influx from the theatre dining crowd but was able to serve everyone in time
Skip the chicken marsala, but definitely order the pasta
I requested pink sauce and a delicious blend of tomato and cream covered my very tasty ravioli
The basic salad was simple but fresh, with the standard variety of veggies
This restaurant is very fairly priced for what you get
This is a very narrow restaurant with 2 floors
We sat upstairs
It was a bit warm at first, but the staff opened the windows
We were left waiting a while after our food for our waiter to return, and thus we did not have time for dessert
The pasta was so good, though, we will be back for a quick pre-theater fix
We had a wonderful time at this small but excellent restaurant
Reservations are a must on the weekends
Dinner took about one hour total leaving us plenty of time to walk around before our show started
As vegetarians we found several tempting entrees on the menu
The staff was very friendly and aimed to please
We would definitely recommend this eatery
Next to Raku, our favorite sushi spot, my wife some friends decided to eat Italian - very convenient to seeing Democracy next door
The food is ok, nothing spectacular, tho service was excellent
Selection of wines ok, again nothing to rave about
Garlic bread is very good, but pricey
They did do a nice job of renovating especially expanding upstairs
My favorite chicken francese was just ok, the pasta selections just ok (I still can't see paying these prices for pasta dishes when we all know you can buy pasta on sale for 3lbs for a dollar! - I rather eat seafood or their veal/chicken dishes)
Overall, this is not a bad place but I prefer TreColori - a lot more fun - noisy but the food value there is very good
Great food for a reasonble price in NY
The service was good
We were nervous when we arrived (1:15 on a Sunday afternoon) because the place was empty, but by 2:00 most of the tables were taken
Only disapointment was pri fixed lunch was not available due to dessert availablity
(It was not offered at all, but we asked about it since we saw it on their website)
I read the reviews here and had to check this place out, and I was not disappointed! It was my husband's birthday, and I could not have found a more romantic place! We ordered chicken, and it was unbelievable soft and tasty
The pasta was not too bad either
Best of all was the service
The people are so nice here, which is so refreshing
In some places, people are either very rude or so friendly that it hurts to keep smiling at them
I felt that people here were genuinely nice
I will definitely go back, and try more dishes
Before going to see a show years ago, we wandered into a restaurant that we ended up loving
Unfortunately, we didn't get the name and I thought I'd lost it forever
Reading reviews on this website, I decided to try South Side Cafe with a friend who was in from Chicago
It was my pleasant surprise to walk in and realize THIS WAS THE PLACE
The food was great and the service was wonderful
I made sure to note the name and address for future reference!
1st Italian restaurant I've been to that is totally run by non-Italians
They do a fair job
Pastas are ok, chicken francese, garlic bread, chilian wine are good
nice atmosphere, busy during pre-theater
Service is very good, polite attentative
Boyfriend and I were searching for place to eat before movie and found this place
glad we did! The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was very attentive and made us all feel special
We happened to get there earlier than norma dinner crowds and were seated right away
When we left, it was very crowded - recommend reservations!! They have excellent garlic bread and interesting dressings for your salads
We definately will return to this place again when we're in times square area!!
The Scene This is a cavernous, cacophonous space with soaring ceiling, colossal Ionic columns, faux-antiqued walls, distressed mirrors and trompe l'oeil murals
Go late and check out one of the hottest after-theater hangouts on Broadway
While waiting for a menu you can grab a crayon--supplied with the butcher paper tablecloths--and draw your date
The Food A garden-variety brasserie menu is supplemented daily by a long chorus line of specials--that is where you might want to focus
Underseasoning is a recurring problem here, whether it's an insipid tomato sauce over ricotta ravioli or the tentative steak au poivre with good (once you salt them) french fries
Grilled salmon with bearnaise sauce is one of the better regular features
A wise strategy is to stick with simple items like roasted chicken, grilled fish and salads
Desserts are satisfying at best
Try the plump, caramelized tarte Tatin
I have this love-hate thing with Cafe 123
Love the authentic brasserie ambience brasserie, but hate that the food is mediocre
Pre-theater dinner last night
Service was pleasant and quick
Drinks came fast (but I was surprised that they 86'd Chivas)

I had dinner at Montrachet recently, and had an excellent meal with several amazing wines
My date and I rate it one of the best romantic spots in the city
The restaurant is elegant and comfortable, and the host, sommelier and servers all very gracious
We started off with fresh oysters and champagne, then had perfectly seared foie gras and a tasty asparagus and truffle salad
We tried the magret of duck and Chilean Sea Bass,both were flavorful and complex
We let the charming sommelier pair wines by the glass for each dish, and each was a wonderful match
I was really impressed
I had high hopes for Montrachet, maybe because of the restaurant group that owns it, or the high Zagat review
Food was ok at best
Service was weak
Had to request someone pour us wine twice and the place was very empty
Soup was bland, so was the lamb
The fish my girlfriend ordered was good except it wasn't paired with anything, nor was my lamb
All and all would not reccommend, waste of time and money
Went here during restaurant week in a blizzard
Upon arriving, the snooty host tells us that our reservation cannot be honored b/c WE didn't call to confirm! That's a new one
When I glanced at the reservation book, I noticed my phone number beside the reservation; although, it was off by one number, my fault evidently
I then see the dining room with it's number of empty tables! The host says he will see if there is anything he can do?! Comes back immediately and says he will be able to seat us, a miracle
He was completely obnoxious and later I realized he was looking for his palm to be greased
You should have seen the silly smirk he had as someone w/out a reservation joined his friends for dinner and passed him a tip! Chanterelle is much better, right down the street not too much more expensive!
Since I was taken to lunch for a birthday celebration, I have no right to complain about the prices, the very high prices, but if I was paying I would have been upset
The food is exquisite, no doubt about that and the decor lovely but where oh where is the food
Granted, I wasn't expecting huge portions, but I shouldn't have left feeling hungry and please I can deal with small portions just not microscopic ones
Grab a slice of pizza before you go or risk embarrasment as you ask for the bread server for just another roll, and another
This place has good food and never crowded
It's nice to just be able to go and not worry about reservations and if the food will taste good or not
This is where I bring all my out of state clients and they all love it so far
I imagine the regular menu prices are more reasonable, but since we were there for V-day, I had a bit of unexpected sticker shock
That said, the food (duck, chilean sea bass) was excellent, and the service was pleasant (not particularly great, but certainly not rude)
In fact, the party sitting next to us were much more snooty than any of the staff
I had reservations for Montrachet which unfortunately I had not confirmed - generally restaurants call if it's required
After the long, rainy trip, the snooty host told me my table had been given up
He told me his notes indicated I had been called several times - that was completely false
I pleaded with him, particularly after our rough trip but he wouldn't budge
Regardless of policy, the condescending manner in which we were treated was outrageous
The man was unapologetic and his brusque tone implied that he didn't for a second believe his precious reservation notes might be wrong, and that we were vile delinquints for not having confirmed or calling back
I would never return to a place that seems to prejudge or arbitrarily measure people and treats people in such an offensive, patronizing manner
If you want a stereotypicaly snotty French restaurant this is for you
From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty
The service was excellent and the food even better
I would recommend this place to anyone
I will be back
Fine food, and fine wine
The $76 tasting course was great
The portions were small, but very good
Everyone complains that there too small
That what a normal portion should look like, so you dont blow up
Professional service, decent atmosphere
They switched our table after we said it was too small
Come here if you have the money
the food was good
however, they really should do something about the portions
i don't know how anyone can leave that restaurant half full
i was starving when i left
the food was also pricey
basically, go there on a special night only
Been there 3 times in 8 months
Decoration: personal touch that you can 't find nowhere else in NYC: elegant and not outrageous !  First time, were 7 (winter, restaurant week)
Service was outstanding (welcoming, discreet, knowledgeable and generous)
Food was ENORME (unbelievable) and the wines simply superbs
We ended with 14 desserts for no extra charge and were offered the dessert wine
Imagine how happy we are to tip the waiters !  2d time in spring (restaurant week)
Were planning on being 8 but only 4 of us showed up
Were given the same treat : extra desserts and dessert wine for free
So we tipped the same way: very generously !  3d time was in August (restaurant month), on a monday night
This was a bring your own wine evening with no cork fee
Same treat - no extra desserts but what a great moment we spent there
Montrachet was an expensive mistake
The first two courses (crab ravioli and chilean sea bass) were delicious, but the last two courses (the selection of cheeses and the souffle) were horrible
The selection of cheeses had four tiny (perhaps 1
5 inches long, 1 inch wide) pieces of very ordinary cheese (like brie and bleu cheese) for $16! The souffle was technically very good (light and airy, with a hollow center) but tasted suspiciously like brownie mix you can buy at the supermarket
My sister had tuna tartare and soft shell crabs
Both were very bland and not worth the money
I highly recommend that you save your $ and find another place to eat
Went for restaurant week dinner
The host was pleasant, as were the waiter and the wine steward (who came over to help us, even though we were only ordering a $35 bottle, which was very nice)
The pre fixe was typical, soup or salad and a fish meat or pasta
The soups were substantial and tasty, but the entrees were VERY small
The foie gras ravioli was almost not enough for even an appetizer portion
The lamb loin was delicious, but again small in portion
The food kept coming rather quickly, but I am sure they wanted to turn tables
The decor was not what I expected of a renowned french restaurant
It almost felt more like a bistro
It was fine for a 30 dollar dinner if you are ever in tribeca during restaurant week, but I think there are better french restaurants out there
Nice b/c Montrachet is not a haughty, stuffy French restaurant where the whole staff thinks they are better than you
They appreciate their customers
Food is great, if you appreciate wine, you;ll love their huge list!! Get the goat cheese salad!! The duck foie gras ravioli is incredible if it's on the menu
A very nice restaurant that doesn't just have to be for very special occasions
Clearly, this is NOT the place for amateurs
I cannot believe all the cretins that have reviewed Montrachet so far
I HAD to comment
First of all - everyone is commenting on the portions - sometimes more isn't necessarily better, it's just MORE
The food is DELICIOUS, are you kidding me? The sweetbreads are succulent, the oysters are tender and delicious, the skate entree is the best I've ever had, the duck is superb, the lamb is delicious
do I have to continue? And the wine list is an impressive display of variety and diversity
and BIG 1982's, wow! I've been a loyal patron for many years and will continue to do so
YES the decor is outdated, YES the host may be snotty, but SUCK IT UP - this place is one in a million and WORTH EVERY PENNY
give Drew a little credit!
Dined here this past Wednesday because they were kind enough to extend Restaurant Week
I really expected miniscule portions after reading the past reviews but they were not
We had full portions for all 3 courses off the special menu

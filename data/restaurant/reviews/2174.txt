Their sushi is always very fresh, the offer some creative maki rolls and also great big bowls of noodle soup
Overall a great lunch every time out
Hizen is a delightful little spot in the middle of a neighborhood not known for really good, reasonably priced food
Having spent a lot of time in Japan, I was very pleasantly suprised to find that it is almost identical to a restaurant for office workers in Osaka
The food is very good and the lunch specials are a great deal
Service is fast, although you won't feel rushed
The only drawback is its size -- only about 12 tables
hizen place is a gem in an otherwise boring food neigborhood full of either super expensive places and cheap takeout
it is a very small, sit-down restaurant w/ bar
serves good and reasonably- priced food
it seems to have a devoted japanese clientele, but is welcoming to non-japanese all the same
the waitstaff are spunky, english-challenged japanese hipsters

how did the last reviewer manage to post the same review three times???
One of the nicest Indian restaurants in the city - great location, pleasant decor, not too noisy, and great food
Highly Recommended!
first thing was it wasnt busy at all yet it still took 10 mins to seat us
the staff was talking among eachother
it took about a good 15 mins for our drinks
the starters were cold and i had to send them back
took another 10 mins
later main course was hot and the food was ok
we dint even bother staying for sweets
overall C
Horrible food- undercooked and cold
Rude, slow waitstaff
Worst indian cuisine experience I've ever had
I visited here with a few of my indian friends who knew the best places to dine on indian cuisine in the city
This is definetly one of them
Succulent chicken, and Jumbo shrimp filled our table
It was flavorful and excellent
Prime location in midtown NYC
Very quaint decor and atmosphere
Highly recommened
The food, service, and atmosphere are all pretty good, but a little pricy, coming to about 40$ a person if you order 1 drink and 1 appetizer each
But for the location and compared to some other reputable places in midtown such as Bay leaf (similr food but HORRIBLE service) I think Diwan is a good find
One of the better Indian restaurants, although a little on the expensive side
I appreciated the decor in the main dining room and the lack of sitar/bollywood tunes! The first place I have been to that serves rumaali roti, and it was aboslutely delicious
We went on a Sunday evening for dinner, and the place was deserted
The waiter was quite attentive, a little too much sometimes
Have also been there for the lunch buffet, but I would recommend ordering from the menu
The best thing about Diwan is its great service, tasty food, decently price -- without being a pretentious Indian restaurant
I had a wonderful dining experiance at Diwan
I am a big fan of Indian cuisine and Diwan is one of the all around best restaurants that i haev had the pleasure of dining at
I feel it was reasonably priced, the service was excellent, and most importantly the food was to die for! I highly recommend Diwan to anyone and everyone
its an enjoyable experiance into the Indian culture
Dropped by Diwan for their lunch buffet which was absolutely delicious
For $12
95 it's one of the best Indian food buffet I've had in NYC
The spice was just right without being too weak and bland
Plus how many places do you know provides free re-fills with ice tea
Their menu items seemed fairly spendy for $20 a dish
But I'd recommend go for the appetizer they're usually under $10
Nice decor and the coat check girl (asian girl) was very courteous who deserved a good tip
I had the lunch buffet
It was $12
95 and well worth it
You can watch the chefs making the nan
The food is brought out every few minutes, so it is fresh
The food was really good
not too spicy for you wimps
I would definitely reccomend
This is a great restaurant to bring friends, family, clients, or dates to
Food is not your typical indian food and the decor is great
Food here is pricey and only so-so
Service is very unorganized
You have far too many waitstaff walking around and asking to take your order when someone else has already taken it
I would not go back
Nice place, and unusually so for a place so close to GCT
Nevermind the bars off Vanderbilt, walk over to this place
Good food, nice atmosphere and great servers
I Especially like Merv and Pete
Pete is a great conversationalist and Merv is hilarious if you can hear and understand him
I've been a local of Turtle Bay for about 5 years now
At first, I wondered why I would go there with all the beautiful places in NYC to be a part of
One answer
the people
The bar is one of the most welcoming you'll ever experience
And the food, all homemade, is worthy of much nicer places in NY
I'd say the best bar food I have ever had
Jason, Marlene, Danielle, and Al are some of the most responsive and wonderful bartenders you'll ever interact with
Rumors are swirling that it will be closing soon so try to catch it while you can
Highly recommended!!!!
People in this bar remind you of your hometown 'gin mill' where you find actual 'locals' who inhabit the place on a daily basis
They all love company of tourists and commuters alike
The barkeep and watress are polite and prompt seving your barroom needs and the food is five star (served till 10pm) for a saloon type place
If there's a problem the owner seems to be on hand day and night
Then there is Tuesday night where the Kareoke is on fire
New York mag got it right naming it the No
1 Kereoke place (1/6/03 ish) and I've been to all 5 on it's list! Whether you can croon or croak you are accepted and wanted
If you thought you couldn't find a place in NYC to fit in, this is the place where EVERYONE fits in and if you stay awhile everyone will know your name
Greatest little bar in NYC
Check your pretentions at the door, everyone in here is down to earth and friendly, even in a drunken stupor
Burgers aren't bad either!
Deep fried skewers are really good and light
You can feel that the oil they are using is fresh
Small plates (appetizer) are really good, too
My Japanese friends said it's authentic, but both of me and my friend didn't like the sushi there
The rice was squeezed too hard which had ruined the whole sushi although the other ingredient (fish, uni, ikura) were really fresh and tasty

One drawback - they don't butter your bagel for you
HH Bagels are way overrated
I used to live in River Edge NJ and River Road Bagels are much better no contest
Of course there are much worse bagel in NY also
anyone who's eaten a REAL bagel knows that HH bagels are nothing but baked bread
A BAGEL is BOILED dough that is then baked
You can tell a real bagel by the fact there are little bubbles in the dough almost popped at the surface -- SOME bagel places (not sure about HH) i order to replicate this look paint (!) these on or bake their bagels on a surface which leaves circular indentations on the bottom
fresh from the oven, freeze beautifully, defrost to perfection
what more could you want from a bagel?  I travel from downtown for them (40min one way!!) This is true love
I was a long-time fan of HH bagels, even ordering them via UPS when out of town
However, the last order I received was a major disappointment
They've changed the recipe! Instead of serious bagels, dense and chewy, we now have bagel-shaped pieces of bread, light and airy
This was probably the result of becoming too popular, but it's a shame
I might as well buy bagels in the local supermarket
These are the best bagels in NY, in the region, heck - in the country!
Authenic New York Bagel
Great bagel
Quick service
Plural locations
Enough said
My father always raved about these bagels, and when I finally tasted I was hooked
They are tasty, soft and chewy!
The sugary confections churned out of the storied HH are closer to donuts than real bagels
Anyone that grew up in this city and knows what a bagel is supposed to taste like knows this isn't it
Check out Pick a Bagel or David's or maybe Ess-a-Bagel if you are looking for a chain that makes respectable bagels
Always fresh, always moving, HH Bagels has been a classic eat for any weekend morning
Their extensive spreads (any tofu spread is highly recommendable) and warm bagels will make anyone feel like a real Manhattanite
And the cute young flirt at the UES shop certainly makes it all worthwhile
The best bagel in NYC does not even appear here! That's The Bagelry at 88th Lexington and 82nd Lexington
These are the most authentic bagels in NYC
How could you miss it?
They have the best, best, best cinnamon raisin bagels ever
No one else's comes close, and believe me, I've had them in many places
You cut one in half, and you can smell the aroma of the bagel
The color, it's much darker than many other cinnamon raisin bagels, and it's jam packed with flavor, not too rich, just right
With other bagels, after I put a condiment on it, I no longer taste the bagel
But with the HH cinnamon raisin bagel, it's still there
HH definitely has the best bagels of NYC
I have to double bagged to stay fresh in my kitchen right now for the weekend
They sell them at my job
They sell out quickly, but today I managed to grab hold of a couple
Don't bother to choose
Justs say what's hot
They're too good to try and pick
Nothing beats a warm fresh H H bagel so go get one now
I used to work around the corner from HH and I had to walk by it everyday
It was a chore to resist the smell of fresh baked, warm-from-the-oven bagels
They are definitely a no-frills, get your bagels and go kind of joint
No tables or chairs to sit down
And they don't butter your bagel or serve it up with eggs like many of the other places in town
Just doughy, fresh goodness
I highly recommend HH, although with Sex And The City hyping it up
I doubt my rating counts
well it's a real good place to sit and relax w/ ur meal and romantic for u and ur spouse
This is the best of the best
What NYC and Brooklyn bagels are all about
The lines are out the door for such a simple thing as water and flour with a hole in the center
It is worth travelling to the upper west side and getting lox in Zabars to eat with HH bagels
It is not a myth it is a reality
Just do it
Excellent bagels
absolutely amazing
you know what I mean
thats all
divine
Okay anything else? GOOD!
Best bagels I've tasted in the city or anywhere for that matter
The Nova's good too!
Just what a bagel should be: fresh, warm, chewy, tasty
It just sell bagels
Go across the street to Zabar's for any topping you might desire
Don't even ask for butter or cream cheese on top
As one salesperson told me, we don't put anything on our bagels
Once you taste the bagels, you will understand why
These bagels are not comparitively cheap (95 cents per bagel), but who is going to complain over cents?
Walk into H H Bagels and the sweet musky smell of fresh-baked bagels will immediately make your mouth water and your stomach grumble
Try ordering just one bagle and you'll hear yourself uttering tye words, I'll take a dozen
Maybe these aren't the best bagels in the world, but they're pretty darn good
Waiting in line, you're almost standing in the kitchen, so it's easy to see what's fresh
Get whatever they've got hot out of the oven -- I like 'em plain, no cream cheese or anything
HH is on the corner right across from Zabar's and there's always a line
I fell in love with HH bagels the first time I came to New York
My friends and I picked up a dozen and sacked out in Central Park all day, waiting on line for Shakespeare in the Park tickets
I will forever associate their doughy, sweet perfection with that glorious, perfect New York day
This place has great pizza! It's a delicious step up from your basic new york pizza
plain is suprisingly exciting, but there are a lot of topping options
I always pick up a pie to go
not sure if they deliver
This stuff is worth it! Yum! I would say best large pie pizza on the UWS! I also really liked the ham and cheese Croissants
I ordered takeout from Harriet's Kitchen
My order was wrong when I received it
I called to have the order corrected and was told that they can't make that order that way
which I was not told in the first place
I ordered a different replacement item and was told I'd have to pay the difference in price
Then I got a call back saying that I had to pay the full price for the replacement dish
I was told that I did not specify enough on my original order, though I was holding the menu they'd written the changes on, with everything written out
This place clearly doesn't believe the customer is ever right
I highly do not recommend this establishment
I order from this place so much
I think I have had everything on their menu

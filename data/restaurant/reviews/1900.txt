The prices are ridiculous
Do yourself a favor: If you are a serious sushi lover do not eat here
There is much better sushi in the city for far less money!
Prices are reasonable, service is so-so, decor sucks but the fish is to die for! fresh and cut very well, the appetizers are yummy and the hand rolls ARE SO GOOD! esp the salmon skin handroll which i think of DAILY!
Great value at any price
Con is ambience
There's nothing fancy here, just quality sushi staples
I read the reviews for this place on citysearch and finally decided to make the trip
Let me just say that this is probably the BEST sashimi I have ever eaten in my life
Every piece of sashimi I ate practically melted in my mouth! Try also the clam miso soup and the seaweed salad
Truly a place for sushi lovers!
Tomoe has the best sushi in New York
End of discussion
I've been to Nobu and I've been to Yama
Nobu's not worth the money
Yama, sometimes inconsistent, is fantastic most of the time, but Tomoe is simply the best
If you want great japanese food, head over to Tomoe
Don't expect great service or a charming ambience, though
After 15-60 min wait, you are seated at the cramped tables, so your neighbors listen to your conversation; and when you take a seat by the wall, you'll probably bump into their food b/c the spacing is so tight
However all that can be forgotten when you're eating the nobu-worthy seabass appetizer, huge fresh shushi and devine banana tempura or green tea ice-cream
It's definitely pricey- about $45/person with tip, but worth every penny
after hearing the raves [and because Yama has been a bit inconsistent] i decided to try Tomoe
talking to the people outside i was waiting with, i thought they'd knock my socks off
but it was only so so
to their credit the scallops were excellent but the tuna sashimi had that unfresh pasty texture and was just this huge chunk
i mean, there's big and simply unrefined
my recommendation would be to go to YAMA
it's better than Tamoe [on my one experience] even on an off day
p
s
- citysearch's price guide is not accurate
it's more like 30-40 per person, so Yama's cheaper too
and the spicy mayo is so much better there too
This was my first sushi experience and anyplace else has been a disappointment
Granted, I live in CT and have not tried very many NYC places, but I am a loyal Tomoe follower
The spicy tuna roll is awesome and everything else has been great, too
Worth the wait
Freshest and best sushi i have ever eaten, The wait staff was very knowledgable and helpful
The fish was the freshest and the tste was out of this world
This is a must for any sushi lover
I just can't get enough of Tomoe
This is the place for excellent sushi and sashimi
Don't skip the appertizers
There is almost always an hour wait at dinner time, but this may be the best Japanese Sushi restaurant in NYC
Their fish is always fresh and flavorful
Go early if you can to avoid the long line
Eating here is bliss Spring, Summer, Fall or Winter Freshest fish ever
The line is worth the wait, this is my favorite place in the city for fresh tasty fish
This isn't the place for decor or ambience - just people who want the tastiest fish at a reasonable price
Great service everyone here are laid back and nice to guests
If ambiance is what you're after, forget about coming here
This hole in the wall restaurant which seats only 38 people is the hands down winner for real sushi snobs
The pieces of sashimi, which look and taste like they weere brought right off the fishing boat, send even the most discriminating palattes into sushi nirvana
The wait on the lines could be downright brutal, but any loyal patron of the establishment could tell you that it's absolutely worth every second
Only two secrets to beating the lines: have a super early, five o'clock dinner, OR call in advance for pick-up
Unfortunately they don't deliver
They have the best rolls I've ever had so far
The line may be annoying, but once you get inside, you'll forget the nuisance
It's cozy, not pretentious or fru fru
Just straightforward good sushi and nothing less
Tomoe offers great sushi
It is fresh
It melts in your month
There's good reason for the constant lines outside this place--from food to service to ambience, they get it all right
best value for money, freshest fish, and tastiest sushi rolls, handrolled in front of the customer, this little tiny soho hangout, does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait in line, unless you get there early enough, however, it is well worth the wait
For those non-sushi fans, teriyaki, yakitori, etc are equaly good! and best value for money in the city!
Tomoe, although tiny inside, offers huge deals on some of the best tasting sushi in the city! The eel was the best I've ever eaten
The food was RIDICULOUS
Get there early, the line was halfway down the block by 6pm
The service was quick, we sat down, ordered, and ate in approx
30 minutes yet did not feel rushed
The best sushi I have had so far in the city
Try the yellowtail and scallion roll and the tuna and avocado
basic but excellent! Also
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP
Ok, so I'm not the biggest wasabi fan, I admit
Perhaps, you could call me a wasabi wuss
Therefore, I did not enjoy the sushi deluxe at Tomoe, as each piece was pre-seasoned with Wasabi
If I had known this in advance, I would have stuck to the rolls, which were quite excellent
Overall after waiting 45 minutes and reading and hearing rave reviews, I expected quite a bit more
My boyfriend introduced me to this place a few months ago
The sushi is excellent and at a great price
For more than 15 years me and my husb
go to Tomoe, the best sushi and great variaty of japanese food
exellent!! If you get there by 5~5:30 when they open you can be in the first clients to eat early dinner, out by 7nish! after that you may wait in line anywhere from 1 to 3 hrs
uff-uff
In the dead of winter I found a long line of mostly Asian New Yorkers waiting outside of this place in the cold
One day, I asked myself Why are they enduring the elements? The food can't be that good
Alas I was wrong
This cozy little spot in the West Village has the best sushi that NYC has to offer
If you can stand the wait (and yes
it is a long wait) you will be rewarded with a meal made with love
if you can handle the wait - in general not less than one hour - your are in for a real treat - generous portions of the freshest sushi - wonderful rolls and the price is right on! charmless yet efficiant waitstaff - but i do love this place - it remains one of the best in nyc
Tomoe is an amazing combination of quality/value
Not only is the sushi mostly stellar, you'd have to be a real bonehead to not take advantage of their cooked items
Tomoe runs a solid kitchen that outputs some impressive food
Both broiled squid appetizers are buttery and delicious
When in line, it's always smart to ask to sit at the sushi counter (not just here, but at any good sushi joint)
That way, you can talk to the chef and find out what fish he recommends
Lately, the mackerel at Tomoe has been very good

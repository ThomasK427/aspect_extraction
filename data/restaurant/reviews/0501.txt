Despite the quaintness of the cafe, and the great atmosphere, the service has been poor each time
While you are free to linger over a book or conversation, getting a check can be a challenge, and change even more so, whether the Cafe is busy or not
Careful not to confuse the counter with a place to order your espresso unless you plan a quick escape, for lingering a minute afterwards brings the prompt scorn of the waitstaff pointing out the the unannounced presence of table service
Esperanto Cafe is the absolute greatest cafe I have ever been to
In the Village, you'd expect to pay an astronomical price for coffee, but not at Esperanto
Coffees only cost around $2
00
The food is outstanding! I highly recommend the Mozzerella Sandwich, Sandwiches are only about $5
00, and they're huge
Giant cookies go for $1
75
Get the ginger, or chocolate chip
If you want a treat, get the Iced Mocha
There's always fantastic music playing, and the waitresses and counter staff are the friendliest people in the city
Esperanto is just a good mellow cafe where they don't mind if you linger with a book or your laptop over a cup of coffee
Even with the music volume a bit on the loud side, I've never had a problem studying there
The prices are pretty reasonable, and the coffee is really good
The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good
Its easy to get overly comfortable at this hip, young, cafe
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave
The only complaint? The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste
Casablanca servces delicious falafel, tabouleh, humus and other Mediterranean delights, which are all very inexpensive
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare
I love this place
No non-sense atmosphere, friendly staff - and most important, excellent kabobs
Go on Sunday nights - no wait
I guess I'm a regular now
I keep coming back to this adored establishment and really find no fault in the killer bellinis and wonderful service
I love the way the servers treat me
They go out of their way to give complimentary menu items and great seating
The atmosphere may be even better than the food
The best thing to order is the fra diavlo, calamari, or proscuitto
Anything with Chip's name on it is a class act
Who is the chef ???? I cook better and who is the manager ??? drop the attitude Education please
go back home stop fake
I went with a Tuesday night party hosted by a promoter and was comped and also got to sample alot of really good appetizers! The broccoli rabe, aspargus, and scallops are notable, and the mixed vegetables are pretty yummy, as are the signature bellinis
The food is good but not amazing; true gourmands may be dissapointed, as people go for the food, the scene, the crowd, the name, the experience, etc
It isn't as pricey as I expected although it isn't cheap (entrees range from 20-35$)
The crowd was pretty strange-- alot of tacky, flashy people with too much $ and not enough taste
I assume uptown is more sedated, elegant, and refined, as this one is honestly a bit declasse
Also, I think this one is considered trendy by Eurotrash, as there was an international crowd with money to burn but without much breeding or class to back it up
Made for a pretty fun experience though! The party I was with was great- a mix of models, photographers, artists, actresses, fun, beautiful people, etc
The upstairs is a sort of nightclub filled with tall, skinny women, eurotrash, and bankers
Pretty typical
I would go back, but it isn't a must-do
I would eat dinner there again, but not if I were paying
If I were to spend a decent amount of cash on dinner, I'd go someplace with EXCELLENT, not just really good food
But, if parents or friends were treating, I would go, knowing I would have fun, but not super-exciting time
Tuesday is fun, Sunday night is a model karaoke party upstairs
Definitely a place to watch celebs, wealthy beautiful people
We had home made pasta, it was ok, but the foi gras was awesome, also great cocktails
Service was average
Of course, you come here for the scene with our good friends that was just purfect night out for us
I live in the hood, and have used Cirpiani's Downtown as a place to catch up with a friend for years
The food has never been fantastic, but it's fine to balance the great drinks, and I consider it as paying rent
I've never been so disappointed as last Sunday afternoon
The server was so obnoxious
I told him we weren't going to be ordering mains
He was constantly preasuring us to order more, after I repeatedly told him we weren't going to
He was trying his best to make us feel cheap!  Our bill was over a hundred dollars, and I declined to leave him a tip on my half of the bill, something I've only done once before
He came after me into the streeet to ask me if I forgot to leave a tip, or if there was a problem
I told him YOU!
The food sucks, the ambience sucks and the service sucks
So why do so many rich glamorous people flock here? You got me, but I know one thing for sure I have never met so many intresting people in my life
Everyone is so friendly, and since you are literally sitting on top of the people next you, everyone gets to know each other
I highly recommend the late night scene upstairs, but good luck getting up there you must know someone or you are out of luck
I am so happy there is a Cipriani downtown to meet my gals for brunch on weekends b4 shopping in Soho! Sometimes theres a long wait for outdoor area, but that's fine
I don't mind paying for a meal at a fancy/name brand restaurant, as long as the food is decent and the service is good
I was visiting home in NY for about 12 days and this was the only chance I had to have a nice dinner in the City
Should have just picked a diner to eat at
You can not believe how disapointed I was
Food was average, price was high, service, terrible, a big minus
Take your money else where!!!
The food portion was way too small and it was below average, i expected much more of this well talked about restaurant
The staff are well trained to keep the drink coming, in fact i am shock that my girlfriend and i were able to get up from our table, i had to tell the waiter to stop asking me if i want to drink more
If you want to see someone a big star thenCipriani is the place for you
please note it's going to cost you a pretty $300
00 for two
How yeah, look rich
if not, well just use your imagination! :( I wouldn't feel right recommending it
If you want (old) people watching, a high energy vibe and good food and don't mind waiting for a table, crowded spaces and high prices, this is a good choice
Although the crowd quality has definitely declined
too many lip enhancements and bad nose jobs
more Dallas than NYC:-( And the bellinis are not hwhat they used to be
I love this place! If you want to see the beautiful, the rich, the rainmakers all in one place, go to Chip's downtown! Score a seat outside and you'll feel like your in the South of France
The food is yummy, and a Bellini is a must (invented by Cipriani!)
I love the old school waiters, too
nice touch
I had a really small glass of belini and paid $15, thats redicilous
Food is great but the portions are to small and its great for people watching
My wife and I went here for lunch
We both ordered pasta dishes ($21
50 each)
They arrived on salad plates (5 inch diameter) which were only half full
I ordered canelloni and received four cigarette sized pieces of pasta and nothing else! My wife ordered a pasta bake and received some pasta noodles drenched in some fatty bland tasting cheese
It was so laden with oil she was unable to eat it
I have no problem dropping $80 for lunch (including 2 drinks) but I expect to receive a plate full of food!!!
Tables are crammed in there, so that they all touch
Many diners trapped in seats against the wall

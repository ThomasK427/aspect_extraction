Food is good
It is quite small and sometimes you can feel a little cramped, but ultimately it is part of the charm
I can't believe I am saying this, but this place was too crowded
having been in NYC for 11yrs now, I've seen NYC tight restaurant space, yet this was uncomfortable
you had to keep your elbows in speak in code
Anyway, totally fun, cool hidden spot in SoHo which is always the reciepe for a good night
and this doesn't disappoint in that regard
Food was a bit above average, yet I felt it could have been a bit more creative
Not bad place, not something you will rave about
We enjoyed good food and atmosphere, but after we paid our bill and walked outside the restaurant, the hostess came outside and stopped us to inquire about our tip
We explained that we had left a standard 15% on food, and a slightly smaller percentage on alcohol (At least 10%)
She persisted (as if expecting us to pull out our wallets in the street) and then informed us that if this was our manner of tipping than we were not welcome to eat there again
Ultimately, the difference was $1
which we would have left if we had realized it was so miniscule
Now, given her disrespectful attitude and offensive manner of customer service, we will never visit again
Go here if you want your evening ruined by the self-involved priorities of the staff
Had a great meal with a friend
The service was great- SO friendly
Had a great shrimp/mango salad that hit the spot for summer
The scene was a perfect mixture of downtown hipster, SoHo glam, and neighborhood down-to-earthedness
Highly recommend it
Don't forget a cool glass of sangria to accompany the meal!!
I stumbled upon this place as it was opening a year or so ago
and I was amazed at the friendly staff and the surprisingly delicous food
The staff has always gone out of their way to accomodate me whether I came by with a friend or a large group with no reservations
They find a way to seat you immediately and have been so friendly and nice to talk to
And I was amazed at the low prices and great sangria food
my favorite place in Manhattan really
I recently discovered this place and I absolutely LOVE it
The food is excellent, I really love the Avocado,Shimp Mango Salad
The staff is friendly and great
I highly recommend this place
It is usally packed at lunch time
Went for lunch during the week - food came out very quickly, server was great, food was really good, and it was about $20 for two of us to get stuffed
Funky, lively atmoshphere
Very casual, tables are kinda' squeezed up against each other, but very cool vibe
I would definitely go back for lunch with a friend or after work for a mojito
Cute place to sit down and chit-chat over a bite
I loved this place
If you're looking for a very reasonably priced meal in a laid back environment, this is it
I recommend going later (after 10pm)
The drinks are cheap (wine for $3
50) and the food is great
The 1950s cuba decor is charming and the waitstaff was friendly--plucked right out of Iowa, perhaps
After seeing this place written up in the NYTimes today, I had high hopes
While the ambience wait staff were both good, the food wasn't particularly Cuban or even an improvement on the classics
We ordered the picadillo, one of the few things on the menu that sounded familiar to us (amid the varied quesadillas), and were disappointed by what came out
the portion was tiny, with more vegetables than meat
The black beans lacked punch and the yucca was cut up into small pieces and fried together with the picadillo (???) so it was virtually indistinguishable
It's so sad to waste a good yucca like that
This place has a calm and beautiful ambience
It has the freshest food -- pasta made in the kitchen there every morning and a menu which changes with the seasons
It is the best place in midtown for a wonderful lunch experience which won't break your pocketbook
In Short This Indian bistro is stylish and vibrant, with orange-and-red walls and exotic aromas wafting from the kitchen
Dine on food adapted from Goa, Punjab and southern India, including Goan veggie curry and Murg Tikka Lababdar--chicken tikkas braised in a creamy tomato sauce
Desserts include a homemade mango ice cream and kheer, a cardamom- and saffron-flavored rice pudding
I love cafe spice for the food
The entree comes in a platter with some salad, dal/lentils, vegetable, rice, and nan
I have been going there for the last two years after having gone to the downtown location, and have not been disappointed
However, my favorite food is from the one at Grand Central, only they don't deliver
I would recommend this place, and it is less busy than the downtown location
I had a great meal here
The portions were generous, and my chicken vindaloo was very spicy and delicious
My friend had the chicken tandoori and enjoyed hers as well
We both left very stuffed and satisfied! The service was very friendly and attentive
It's certainly not the cheapest Indian food around, but not bad for a nice midtown restaurant
French bistro fare perfect for a pre-theater repast
In Short This Theater District bistro, sister to East 54th Street's Jubilee, specializes in Prince Edward Island mussels, which it serves five ways: marinieres, baked, curried, in chicken broth and cold with balsamic vinaigrette
The rest of the menu is upscale French bistro fare: pot au feu, cassoulet, housemade chicken-liver pate with truffles and steak tartare
Lunch features smaller versions of the same
The clientele is a mix of local professionals and theater-goers
Excellent neighborhood French restaurant
Although in the West 50's, the tourists have not yet discovered this cozy, charming eatery
Everything on the menu is excellent
The service is wonderful and definitely not in the midtown 'rush you out for theater time' mode
Jubilee offers a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere and the food compliments the excellent wine list and friendly service
The Scene Blink and you'll miss this tiny restaurant in the heart of Carroll Gardens
There are only a handful of tables, but the upside is that the atmosphere is so cozy, diners feel like they're eating in someone's living room
A comfy banquette in the window and light fixtures (designed by one of the chefs) complete the intimate vibe
The Food  Crave's two chefs have resumes that boast stints at Payard, Nobu and Industry (food), so it's no surprise their menu is full of unusual twists on old favorites
Tender arctic char is cooked in a parchment paper package with winter vegetables and just a smattering of dried plums
Rich pan-seared duck is accompanied by brussels sprouts so tender and flavorful, they'll win over the most ardent sprout haters
Do not under any circumstances leave without trying the rum cake, topped with a surprisingly perfect shaving of Parmesan cheese
Get off Smith Street and try this place now! Whether you want a gourmet duck dish or a burger Crave has what you need
Yes, it's tiny and there is only one server but they make it work
Food is outstanding the wine list is small, eclectic and moderately priced
Go, go, go
My girlfriend has been asking me to take her to this place in Brooklyn
Why I waited so long to explore the backstreets of Brooklyn? My intent was to make it date night
I will tell you HOT DATE! We showed up without a reservation but were seated as soon as a table opened up
The believe the server said his name was Rory- was outstanding from begining to end! He offered us a glass of wine, we waited, and from then on the food and everything was great! We were told about the menu just being changed and with vegitarian selections added! My girlfriend being a Vegan was delighted! Overall OUTSTANDING experience! GREAT WINE SELECTION-we had 2 bottles! Next time I will make a reservation
seems to be a hoppin hideaway! And they cater too! So, when we get married-I will surely consider them to cater our reception!
I have been to Crave a few times and the service, food, and atmosphere have always been exceptional
I highly recommend this restaurant
this food was not something you would CRAVE
there new vegetarian menu is a joke? i will not be back and maybe you should question going yourself
over priced and understaffed! also they were out of various menu items which is my personal pet peeve when eating out
if there was music it was drowned out by chatter and the constant ringing of the phone that was barely answered
Recently i ate at crave with high hopes considering the reviews and recomendations from friends
the bottle of wine we asked for they no longer carried yet still on the menu

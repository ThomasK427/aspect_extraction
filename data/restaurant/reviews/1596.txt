Food was good
Food presentation was excellent
The crispy duck in coconut curry was excellent
The food at Holy Basil is surprising
really good flavor - best bets are the fried tofu, the dumplings and the steamed spring rolls
Word of warning, the staff is not great when it comes to large parties
I recently hosted a dinner there for 22 people and we were only provided with one waiter, who while lovely, seemed very overwhelmed
All in all, great value for great food
I will go back
When you can get Thai dishes that are so delicious and well-rounded, chock full of vegetables, carbs and excellent spices, it's surprising Holy Basil just doesn't get it right
Especially given the relatively attractive environment its decor creates
What an overrated place! Every time i walk into the place they tell me to wait 1 hour or more, too smoky and the food wasn't even great! Think rubbery chicken!
We were a couple of minutes late for our reservation and minus one guest, but we didn't think we deserved the attitude we got from the hostess
Our server was clueless
She kept on disappearing, couldn't answer questions about the menu, and then brought us the wrong bottle of wine
showed the bottle to/poured the taste for the person closest to her, not the person who ordered the wine, and the mistake wasn't realized until the wine was poured and everyone took a sip
No effort was made to remedy the situation
The food was ok
nothing to write home about
At least it didn't cost a fortune
Good food and drinks
Try the Tai iced tea, very good
Good sized food portions too
Service was good
I'm not sure about what exactly authentic Thai food is, but I do know that the food served up at Holy Basil is tasty
very tasty, might I add
Decently priced and a nice spot as well
Check it out
So I'm a thai food lover and while I don't admit to knowing exactly what is and isn't authentic, I have to say that I LOVED this place
I got the Pad Kee Mao and it was perfectly spiced, especially after I added a bit of the red chili sauce
Also, the duck dumplings are unbelievable
I eat out all the time and am quite snobby about where I return to
Let's just say that I plan to make regular trips to this place
If you want to try some really great Thai - Holy Basil is the place
Don't get me wrong--I like the food here very much and recommend this restaurant
But the glowing reviews makes me want to temper this review so as not to unduly heighten expectations
This is a solid, reliable restaurant that is reasonably priced
But it is NOT that best Italian restaurant New York City has to offer
Noisy room
This place is fantastic in all terms
The atmosphere is simple, but elegant, the stuff is impeccably trained and friendly
Especially I enjoy the moment when the waiter is listing the Daily Specials
His descriptions theselves are extremely mouthwatering made in the best Traditions of Italian Food Promotion :-)  I like veal parmigiano and related dishes, but I can not skip chicken and seafood meals, because they are delicious
Don't forget about Dessert! They have a large choice of desserts and all of them are yummy!  We are often visitors at this place and it remains at the same high level of food quality and service all the time
We even had several very important family events there
The manager and waiters in the restaurant were very reliable and executive in organizing these events, providing us not only with perfect food and service, but also with family like warm atmosphere
Want a perfect, simple, Northern Italian dinner
They are not trying to impress anyone, just doing what they feel comfortable doing, and making you feel like the most important persaon there, it comes natural to them
The service is first class, and wonderful
They know when to back off and let you enjoy, and when to be more personal and helpful
The food is simple and to the point, with simple garnishes on white plates and no unnecessary plating presentaions to feed your visual appetite and fool your taste buds
The flavors are what they should be, and taste like what they are
Sounds silly, but hard to find these days
Go there for a quiet evening with a date and enjoy!
Classic Italian Dishes prepared simply and fresh
No glitz here - just homey surroundings attentive service
The wine list also reasonable with classic standard issues
The chicken and veal were excellent as was the home-made pasta w/4 cheeses
The kind of place you used to find in Little Italy but the rents forced out
If you're looking for fancy, this isn't 4u, but it's been there 20+ years! Very reasonable pricing make it a bargain in NYC's la-la land of astronomic gastronomics
A+
We've eaten everywhere from the Four Seasons, Nobu, to Gramercy Tavern
This is hands down our favorite place to eat
Great value, great service, you walk out stuffed like a tick
I've never had northern Italian food until arriving at Capucine's and I was highly impressed
The seafood is superb and the flavors well balanced
The waiter was around just enough to ensure that everyone was satisfied and left us peacefully to our meal
The decor is cheery yet subdued
I highly recommend this place
My first visit to Capucine was nothing short of fantastic
The food was fresh and prepared with skill
Not to mention some of the best service I have seen
I will make this place a regular thing
Elegant but Casual restaurant
Excelent Personal Service
If you like Northern Italian its a must try
Prix Fixe Lunch Dinner but don't order until you hear the specials
The Best Osso Bucco!!!  From the Bus Boys all the way up to the Owners they will make your dining experience fell like you are the only table in the restaurant
Always great!!! I keep coming back to this place again and again because of the great food and friendly service
as do lots of people, I've noticed!! I alway see so many 'regulars' that have been going for years and years
Great home-made, fresh Italian food
Great friendly service
Nice atmosphere
Great prices
this is one of the best dining experiences I've had! great food, great service, perfect atmosphere
Needless to say I'm hooked and will return soon
Great Food, Great people, Great service! The Gnocci was paticularly light and very flavorful
Specials were all the Northern Italian staples done well
Do not miss this restaurant if you are near Gramercy Park
One negative was the salad with blue cheese dressing
We order Capucine's delivery more than once a week, and the doorbell rings right after we put the phone down
Great basic italian pastas- the primavera has great vegetables, and the vodka sauce has a nice little kick
Good appetizers too, and everything is reasonably priced
So glad Capucine's is right around the corner!
The food is superb and the service cannot be improved
You feel like you'rE having a dinner hosted by your family
Capucine's has been a favoirte of mine for over 15 yrs and the beat goes on
The Scene This handsome brasserie has walls frescoed with stylish Parisian sketches; a frisson of noise and commotion raises the pitch
During warmer months, the restaurant's street-facing cafe boasts one of the neighborhood's most glamorous beacons for people-watching
The Food Clearly, the point here is the fantastic steaks and pommes frites: They are consistently well-prepared, and surprisingly affordable

Took some friends visting from London
Food was fab but the service was terrible
They crammed us in on a table where we were touching the people at the next table and the waiter has such an attitude!
The food can be delicious, but the attitude is thicker than pea soup at Bottino
The scene is cool at lunch on the weekends
But the service is always bad
Try to avoid dinners
And make sure to always check your bill
Ate here on a sunday night
Food was very good light Italian cuisine
It was good value
Ambiance was cool
Our waitress was very good
Would recommend it for couples or groups
white decor, bar scene with attitute, and simple food that you can make at home at lower cost, go there if you bring good company and live close to the restaurant
Loved my evening at Bottino
Rarely does a restaurant offer good, solid, simple Italian food in an atmosphere that is lively and fun
The restaurant had a great scene ---very attractive crowd of different ages and styles ---- chich but definitely unpretentious
All in all I had a great evening there!
This stylish restaurant are divided into three sections that all flow beautifully into each other and creates a sense of openess
Choose to sit in the candle lit middle section with small round tables, or the left room with its long tables(great if you're a large party), or the inside garden with beautifully lit trees
Classic designer furniture and white walls meet rustic italian floor and walls
The food is fantastic especially the free range chicken and the green ravioli
Only major complain I've had through my visits is the speedy arrival of the entrees
The chefs could easily slow things down and enjoy the ambiance as much as the guests are
Four friends and I dined for a special occasion on a recent Friday and we all enjoyed ourselves immensely
Our knowledgeable waiter was a plus as was the food (coooked to the specifications of two of our posse') and the overall decor of the restaurant
We had a round table which added intimacy and charm to the experience
The design allows for couples along the walls and larget groups thoughout the 3 room space
The tuna tar tar and the salmon were especially tasty
The wait staff, bartenders and coat check personnel were all friendly and attractive without being too pushy
I went to Bottino two nights ago
A friend had recommended it so we went there despite the weather
I was really impressed
Ive lived here all my life, but have never found such a stylish place that is so unpretentiously cool
The service was completely professional and extremely friendly
The food was impeccable
The tuna tartar was amazing! Then I had the spaghetti with clams which blew both me and my date away! It was such a wonderful night! I definitely recommend it!
Check out the black-draped galleristas and neighborhood art-boys enjoying Bottino's wonderful fritto misto in this always hopping Chelsea staple
The kitchen has never had an off-night in the dozens of times I've eaten there
My two girlfriends and I went to Bottino and had a great time
We were promptly seated in the back outside garden
The place is very lovely
The waiter was pleasant enough
The down side is that the tables are quite close together and cramped
The food was quite delicious but depending on what you order
quantity varied
My friend ordered the halibut and had a huge quantity while my lasagna while delicious was flat and tiny with nothing on the side
Each table became filled to the max as the night wore on
The atmosphere is young and attractive
A lot of people on dates
two group parties in the garden area
A nice bar and lounge in the front and romantic but small dining tables in the middle with the small but lovely garden tables outside in the back
My favorite place in New York City! Bottino has it all!!! Great looking space, beautiful garden, good food
no pretension here at all! The bartenders and waitstaff are terrific - cool, great looking and very, very friendly
Best staff around! The food is good too
The fritto misto and tuna tartar - out of this world! Bottino is everything a restaurant should be - we've been going for years and hope we'll be going for many more years!!! It is definitely worth a trip or two or three
GO!
The gyros here are the best
The cucomber sauce is a little sweet, something different from other places
Decor isn't as great, since this place is more like a fast food place, but definitly worth comign here for the food
Buffalo wings are good, and the roasted chicken is one of the best I've tasted
They have the best food ! Great soups and specials, the gyros and souvlakis are excellent
Everything is fresh and tasty
I highly recommend it to everybody
Love the chicken souvlaki in pita
Great greasy, salty fries
A real value for your money
Just do the Take-Out, as the service staff are very cranky and rude
If you're looking for a decent breakfast before hiking through the park to your favorite museum, Cosmic Coffee Shop is perfect
My husband and I were staying at the Mayflower (late July 2002) two blocks away and ate there each morning (the hotel restaurant was too pricey)
By our second visit, the waiters recognized us and made us feel right at home
Good food (NOT greasy), cooked to order, quick and polite service, pretty good coffee, comfy booths and VERY convenient to Central Park
We never had to wait for a seat (of course, it WAS summer in NYC)
And if you have the kids in tow, there are a couple of large tables near the window
Only negatives: you'll have to ask for Sweet-n-Low if you want it, and there was a noisy cooler in the corner of the room
Otherwise, two thumbs up for Cosmic Coffee Shop!
Went for dinner and would definitely go back again
Service was quick and friendly
Food was very tasty
Prices were inexpensive
Vegetarian dishes available
I enjoyed my pad thai noodle entree very much!
consistantly good
always fast
lots of variety and lunch and dinner specials
delicious Thai custard in acorn squash shell
I've waited tables in two different Thai restaurants, so I know my Thai food, and I expect good service when I dine out
The first time I ate here it was horrible, but I decided to give it another try
The first striking thing about Krour Thai is that they don't have pad Thai on their lunch menu
On my first visit the service was horrible
The second time it was worse: didn't get the chili paste I'd requested, no one asked if everything was ok, had to ask several times for a water refill--and the food was awful
I believe this was the first time I'd ever completely stiffed my waiter
Even if the food is bad, good service can make up for it
The place wasn't even crowded
The waitstaff was grumpy and ill-mannered
Go anywhere but Krour Thai
There are lots of great Thai restaurants in Manhattan
Pepe Giallo is one of my new favorites
Great food, inexpensive prices, a nice little garden in back, very friendly service

The food superb, the service couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive
Our waitress Tris made our brunch an enjoyable experience
We will be back again soon, with friends! Hope says It's better than great!
I discovered the WB Cafe on citysearch and I can't tell you how much I loved it
We were a large group for Brunch
the service was awesome, the food delicious and the atmosphere was perfect
They had live music which we all thoroughly enjoyed
and not too loud
so it was easy to listen to the music and still carry on a conversation
The prices were very reasonable
Sam Talbot, the Chef/Owner came out to say hi
I can't wait to go back to try their dinner menu
Be sure to request seating in the indoor garden
it's very charming
What an amazing experience, the food, the service and atmosphere were bar none
I haven't had so much fun
Blake our waitress was fun and friendly and the waiters were HUNKS, WOW not to mention the owner/chief
I truely can't wait to get back
Also the music dirty gospel was perfect
My first visit to the WBC was for brunch, and it is a fantastic place
We were a party of 9, and the service was excellent, the food all came to the table at once and it was delicious
We really enjoyed the live music, and the atmosphere, especially the old photos of the neighborhood
It is a friendly place, with great food
A real find!
This is undoubtedly the BEST NEW RESTAURANT in Williamsburg
Im so tired of having to go to Manhattan just to have a decent meal
Thank god I finally tried the WBC
The food is unmatched, and be sure to try one of the daily specials
The wine list is excellent, with reasonably priced wines from a wide range of regions, with many varietals to chose from
There are several choices of seating areas (sidewalk, a front room that is open, a large back room with lush plants and a very unique decor, and others)
Thankfully, the service was also excellent and very un-Manhattan (i
e
not rude)
WBC is great for a romantic date, a large group, or just a casual dinner
I finally dined here tonight and I was amazed
It's really one of the best restaurants i have eaten at in NY and WAY better than any place in the neighborhood
They have a super cute space and the service was very good
I laughed at my boyfriend after this reminding him that he was happy at the thankfully gone L cafe
This place is a gem
Try it out and tell your friends
Oh yeah - they have really great historical photos of the neighborhood
I had seared Tuna (perfect), and the Banana flambee for desert
I licked all the plates
My man had Caesar salad - the dressing was perfect yet classic and a pizza, which was great - they have a brick oven and an open kitchen
I can't wait to try the brunch
We went, the first time, for brunch b/c the place that we normally go to was full
We were so pleasantly surprised by the amazing brunch that we had there
The service was so attentive
but not annoying and the food was extra delicious
We had our little dogs with us, on the sidewalk patio, and they even brought our doggies water (with ice-cubes)
without us even asking!!! We will be back for sure
The service here is unacceptable
We found a large insect in our cup of coffee, asked the bus boy to show/tell our waiter, and when we gave the waiter zero tip because he didn't acknowledge, apologize or compensate for the fact that there was an insect in our food (not a gnat or fruit fly - it had six legs!) the waiter (a bald guy who has cantankerous from the beginning) had the nerve to chase us down the street to complain about getting no tip
I will never come back here again
and I hope all who live in the neighborhood decide to take their appetites elsewhere
though the food is very good (short ribs, coffee rubbed filet, meatloaf, white bait frites) the waitstaff needs a little boost in the clue department
and what's with having to stand in the middle of the restaurant until you decide what you want off the menu board? do us a favor and spend some money on printed menus
did the tables and chairs come from an abandoned Olive Garden? work out the kinks and you'll have a gem on your hands
This tastefully decorated restaurant has many Williamsburgh artifacts creating a very romantic atmosphere and the food could not be more superb
It is partcularly nice to sit in the indoor garden where you will find live music during brunch on the weekends and during evening dinners
The Chef creates unique dishes that are incredibly delicious and there certainly is no skimping on the portion size
There are many reasonably priced wines, appetizers, entrees, and desserts
The staff are very personable and they provide excellent service
I highly recommend this restaurant for a truly enjoyable dining experience located in a great neighborhood!
Really enjoyed our visit to this new restaurant
The unique decor was intriguing
The park-like atmosphere, live music and excellent wait staff set the tone for the delicious and creative food that followed
There are many choices for appetizer, entree and dessert and everything we ordered was terrific! This reasonably priced restaurant is a true find and a wonderful addition to the Williamsburg restaurant scene
Don't miss it!
my girlfriend and I had had brunch here a few weeks prior and enjoyed it so very much we decided to come back and try dinner
We were seated in the beautiful garden dining room, impecabbly decorated with pictures and memorabilia from old Williamsburg,
the waitstaff was very friendly, knowledgable and made great suggestions
Everything we had was absolutely scrumptious
also, astonishing for a restaurant with such panache, the wine list was populated with very reasonably priced wines
i had the shirazz which I loved at $4
00 a glass!!We both eat out quite a bit and decided that it was the best meal that we have ever had
We can't wait to come back and share this wonderful find with our friends; perfect ambience, flawless servce and extensive, constantly changing menu with superb food, one really can't ask for more! kudos to the chef and to the Williamsburg cafe!!
This place gives a much needed change of pace to Williamsburg - Its unlike any of the other tired haunts and delivers with both food and ambience
You dont even feel like you're in brooklyn - almost like dining in some atruim in middle america, but the food is nothing of the sort
The dishes can be a little on the pretentious side (smashed potatoes, something crusted or a pan seared confit demi-glaze or whatever) but they are well worth it
Try th espresso filet for dinner and everything ive had fro brunch f'n rocks
espcially the red sangria with cinnamon and tabasco - see like i said pretnetious but unexpectedly delicious
kudos
I heard there was a new reataurant in the hood so last thursday night my girlfriend and I gave it a shot
We sat outside and listened to the live music
The menu is ecclectic and really fun,its food you can eat every night
After our meal our server told us to go to the back for the indoor garden WOW WOW WOW
Plants were everywhere,two big wood ovens had amazing aromas
This place is like a playground with great food
My new favorite restaurant
My boyfriend and I read excellent reviews of the Williamsburg Cafe, but we're both very disappointed by the food service
At first glance, the menu sounds out of this world
I chose the salmon and he the cod
Both dishes were, to put it mildly, underwhelming especially when you consider the price
The lemon in the salmon was overpowering and the bland lentils were completely uncomplementary
Oh, and the service absolutely stunk!!!!!! The people behind us got the salad after dinner and the people next to us had to wait an hour for their entree and were bitching up a storm
I can't blame them
Work on service, work on flavor and overall consistency, and maybe we'll come back
but not for a long time
i've been here for brunch twice, and the food's not bad -- was getting sick of teddy's and relish every weekend

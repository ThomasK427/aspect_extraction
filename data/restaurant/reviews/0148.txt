I go generally with one friend but on occasion have popped in with more, if a table is not possible, as they are booked solid every night, well, the food and service is just as over-the-top amazing at the bar or in the lounge as it is in the dining room
Everthing is simple here, the room, the food, the fire
A great staff of knowledgeable folks, always someone to answer a question
Go expecting the best food and something refreshing
you will not be treated like a celebrity but rather family at Peasant
Was taken here on my birthday and had eaten downstairs once before
Highly recommend this place
Win list is great and the food amazing
The atmosphere is that of a Tuscan kitchen (which is open in the back with a wood-burning fireplace/oven)
Very romantic
Peasant is a fabulous restaurant that I wish I had found earlier
We went during the heat wave and although the restaurant was a little warm the staff did everything they could to cool us down
Chilled prosecco was brought complimentary and at the end we had icey sweet sorbetto that hit the spot
The food was delicious and we can't wait to go back in the fall to really enjoy the burning fires!
we went to Peasant last Tuesday night
The menu was in italian and we were dependant on the waiter to help us
We asked him for a wine recommendation around $30 and got major attitude
When it came time for him to translate the menu, he went so fast skipping over items insisting we wouldn't like them
He went through the appetizers and the pizza and then left us
Ten minutes later, he went through the entrees and continued to edit it telling us what we wouldn't like
We asked him to repeat some items and he said you are taking too much of my time
He came back and and asked us about dessert
Why would we endure another round of his attitude and bad translation on a dessert menu? It seems like your experience depends on your waiter
My advice : bring an italian dictionary with you
I took a date to Peasant over the weekend and it was great! The restaurant is in a cool location and is beautiful to look at when you walk in
We had four different appetizers to start because we couldn't decide on just two
We shared the beet salad with cheese, razor clams, baked asparagus with egg and mozarella inside prosciutto
They were all great - I could have ordered more
Then my date had the whole grilled fish which I tried - it was cooked to perfection, soft and moist and not covered in heavy, creamy sauces - just the fish
I had the lamb and it was delicious
I'm definitely going back
Its like being back hope with my family in Sicily
Great atmosphere, food and service
Had dinner at Peasant Sat nite with my girls
It was wonderful
The food was rich robust
I recommend the pig and the white asp
risotto! But be careful
the drinks are strong!!! We practically had to be carried out and the cute waiter walked us almost 2 blocks just to help us into a cab
now that's service!!!
This isn't Italian like grandma used to make
This is authentic countryside delicacies from every corner of the peninsula
Brick archways frame an open kitchen where the wood burning flames fill the room with romance
Our waiter, translated the menu from the printed Italian, seemed to know every dish personally and recommended a great wine from Sardegna
Ever had a Sardegnan wine? Try one on for size they're big, bold and delicious
I had a succulent spicy baby octopus followed by thin spaghetti with dried mullet roe
WOW! This dish is much greater than the sum of its parts
My date, less adventurous, had prosciutto with figs and tender, juicy lamb over a creamy parmesan polenta bursting with flavor
For dessert: Panna cotta, heavenly, and bread pudding, sweetthickhotcoldrich
We had a great time together, we talked and laughed and had a sumptuous meal
I can't wait to go back
During a business trip to NYC I was brought to Peasant by a customer and I had a great meal and a great time
I am a Risotto fenatic and Peasant's Risotto Granchi e Piselli was perfect
We had a really fun server and the room is nice enough for a big date
My customer is a regular at Peasant and I am going to be a new regular
I was so excited to dine here only to be completely let down by this awful experience
We were seated late, endured a rude and obviously bored waiter, our first courses were undercooked, salty and/or overoiled, then we waited nearly an hour for our main course
Not even an apology was offered
I will persuade people not to dine at this establishment
On a recent Saturday night, we had made reservations for Peasant for 4 at 10
00
Upon arrival, chaos ensued
At 10
30 we were still not seated upon which we inquired with the hostess when we would be seated
In a very rude we're so above you tone, we were told to keep waiting at the bar, 30 min after our reservation!! The manager was called, and he too had a very rude, matter-of-fact attitude on our wait, and he did not offer us a thanks for waiting drink
After 35 min of idle waiting for a reservation we had made, we left, never to come back
Please don't patronize this soon to be forgetten snooty place !!!
The overall dining experience was really good
Food was basic and nicely done, although not terribly challenging
Ambience is really romantic yet with enough edge to make it fun for a group
My only gripe was that the entire menu(which had at least 25 items) was in italian
When the waiter came to translate, he spoke so quickly that it was hard to really absorb what we were about to order
The italian-only menu seemed a bit contrived and pompous and wasted time for us and the waitstaff
Otherwise, we recommend a visit there and the wine bar downstairs
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here, Peasant has been our favorite! It's traditional, simple italian food
It's very simple
the whole grilled fish is just that, a whole fish grilled to perfection, no smoke screens, no fusion cuisine, no butter pecan infused garlic mousse sauce just good fish
The same with the steak or the lamb
It's just good food, nothing more and that's all we want! The wine list is extensive, well priced and covers alot of regions
good food good wine that's it
By the way the menu is in Italian, every review states this so if you find it annoying
it's not the place for you, we hated it at first but now we can practically speak italian
italian menu anyway
Upon entering a beautiful dining room, I was eager to sample the vittles
Excitement faded to disappointment with every minute
The first bothersome experience was trying to interpret the Italian-only menu
Then the waiter showed up and barked the English translations at us
We couldn't remember what he had said by the time he was done
That foreign language menu gimmick adds nothing to authenticity
It only alienates and bewilders diners
Course after overpriced course, I was wishing I had gone somewhere else
A prosciutto and pear plate featured soggy fruit and tasteless prosciutto
A langoustine pasta was bland, and a whole fish was neither crispy nor hot
The roasted lamb was more like lamb carpaccio
It really was raw
Bread pudding dessert was dry
The only pleasurable part of the meal was the delicious, farm-fresh marscapone served with crusty Italian bread
Despite the gorgeous setting, this place needs work
The first time I went to Peasant I was on a blind date
The food was delicious and although we were intimidated by the menu at first we actually enjoyed learning about Italian food

When we asked about this on the bill, waitress said we're TOLD to do it that way with some serious attitude
Food was disgusting - quesadillas were burned to a crisp, cuban was on STALE bread with a measley slice of ham, and fries were either soggy or hard as rocks
Gross
Service was completely unattentive and combative, and when we left the servers were all huddled together pointing at guests
only reason this place is in business is b/c they're one of the few mexican places in the area
NOT WORTH IT!!!!
If you bad service, rude waitstaff and managers, and sub-par food come here
otherwise, choose any other restaurant within a block of here! I tried to go here with 6 other people for lunch
the place was empty
we had reservations, but it made no difference
they tried to put infants in booster chairs
complete idiots!
I recently went to Mustangs for my girl friends 21st b-day
WE came in from NJ and had a wonderful time
THe service was outstanding, and the food was fantastic
Our waitress was very nice, she talked with us and was always on top of everything
THe margaritas were out of this world
THe manager on duty was extremely hot and the waitresses were pretty too
I would definenty recommend this resturant if you want a good time and good service
Been going to Mustang for about a year now
I live on the upper east side and frequent many of the places there
The reason I like Mustang is depending on your mood you can choose your own atmosphere
The bar is lively, the outside cafe is always hoppin and the lounge is private and sexy
Plus they have the best tequila list in the city!
Went to Mustang last Friday nite and had a great experience! We sat in the outside cafe with only a ten minute wait
My date and I ordered margaritas and mussels, which were outstanding! We were only planning on having appetizers, but our server described such wonderful entrees we had to stay
We were definitely satisfied and will come back for a second date!
My friends and I went to Mustang for drinks
We love to sit in the lounge and hang with the hot waitresses(the tunes aren't bad either)
From the time we get there we feel so taken care of
Being a group of demanding guys, our drinks were never empty and neither were our egos
We even thought it was cool that our waitress bought us a round of shots and knew our names by the end of our night
I went to Mustang with several friends to celebrate one of their birthdays
The security outside was real nice and friendly but I was surprised but the personnel that worked inside
Not only did we have to wait an unbelievable amount of time, the service was just plain rude
When I asked for a particular drink, the waitress gave me dirty look and annoyed b/c they didn't know what it was
On top of which, her personality was just unpersonable and the wait for the drinks was ridiculously long
I even noticed another waitress have a semi brawl with some other customers outside the place
I totally do not recommend anyone to go
Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else
If you like to be chased out of a restaurant by a low class waitress asking why her tip is not 20%, than Mustang is the place for you
After waiting more than 15 minutes for our order to be taken and then having the waitress not know how to make certain drinks, our party of 7 was obviously dissatisified
1 round was enough! We were outside not even 2 minutes when the waitress stormed out of this over-priced Taco Bell to accuse us of being disgusting for not leaving enough tip
To top it off, she threw the money back at us (literally)
The drinks were over-priced and that coupled with her extreme rudeness warranted the $1
61 tip
Spare yourself the aggrivation and avoid Mustang
Easily the best Margaritas on the Upper East Side
Awesome Quesadillas, and a great service staff
Been going to Mustang for years and years to enjoy margaritas (one of the best I've ever had) and mojitos
A friend suggested the place for dinner the other night and much to my surprise the food was outstanding!!! Always thought of Mustang as a bar, but not anymore
I found out that they recently started delivering, great news for the winter
Can't wait til we can sit outside again though
The beer was bad, the pitcher of margaritas was way overpriced, and the pseudo-TexMex food was average at best
The quesadilla lacked flavor and was skimpy on ingredients
The fettucine alfredo was okay, but they made it TexMex by throwing in a few peppers
We were thirty feet from the door but felt a continual draft
It took a long time for the waiter to bring the check and we had to flag him down
The decor reminded me of an Applebee's or TGIFriday's
Mustang Grill was way too crowded and overpriced
The food was definitely edible but also forgettable
They're just kind of shuffling people in and out of the place
Maybe it's a better bar than a restaurant
I haven't been to the bar section
Was expecting a typical Upper East Side post-college watering hole
Instead, had a great meal, with great service in a very entertaining atmosphere
I remember this place was great about a year ago
The recent visit with my boyfriend was totally unpleasant
The music playing inside was too loud for people sitting outside
They charged chips and served bread and little muffin
Their margaritas weren't impressive anymore
I felt bad that I dragged my friend to this place
The food was overpriced too
I wish I knew name of my waitress so I say could say just how bad she was
I took her 10-15 just to take our drink order
Then when we got our food she brought the wrong order and didn't come back for what seemed like a half hour
My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait to be sat at all
It is very loud inside so if you want to have a decent conversation, sit on the front or side patio
We sat on the side patio and our waiter seemed to forget that we were there half the time
The food was ok but the drinks were good and if you love tequila, you will love the choices
Ask for drink refills before you are completely empty or you'll be sitting there with an empty glass for a while
We had a decent meal at Mustang, but the service was a bit on the slow side
No bread or tortilla chips on the table you have to order that seperate
Ordered an appetizer and the portion was also very small
The food itself is good, and the cigar bar is a plus if you want to hang out afterwards
This place his a great happy hour
just don't sit at a table during it! My friend and I sat at a table and had about 7 drinks a piece during the 'happy hour,' all the time telling our waiter that we wanted to get a few more drinks before happy hour ended, only to realize when we got the check that happy hour doesn't apply to the tables!! The food was good, and besides for that mistake our waiter wasn't bad, but I used 80% of her tip to pay the difference in the drinks that she didn't tell us about!
I just read the review by the guy/girl? that said the service was so poor they felt like they were on candid camera and I can't agree more
It is absolutely laughable
They tend to have three bartenders all standing around while the patrons are waving bills in the air trying to get a drink
This is when it is not crowded, if you ever go in there on a good night, you won't be drinking
On the other hand, it will be a cheap night and you definitely will not wake up with a hangover
I live about thirty steps away from the place and nobody I know will go in there
if you're stuck in the area
Some of the appetizers are a little out of place with ambitions of prettiness, but the burger is not bad
I just went there for the first time and the place is wonderful
Everyone is friendly and I cant wait to go again
Im planning on it this weekend!
It's good for a night out
Good drinks, good nightlife, but the food leaves something to be desired

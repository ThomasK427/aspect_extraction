It was definitely worth the price as we all had such a good time
I went to azafran after reading reviews of other people abd let me tell you it was worth the trip, and I will go back there again and again
The star was the sea food paella and the mixed croquets
But the sangria is better than all
very recommended
We arrived for our 6 PM reservation to find the restaurant completely empty, one waiter and one person in the open kitchen
We were led to the very back of the industrial decor style room and wedged in a corner against a wall
Although we were the only customers at the time, when we asked for a better table we were told they were all reserved When we left at 7PM exactly 4 more people had arrived
Yes the Tapas plates are tiny but $9 each for a small cup of french fries or 6 croquets the size of marbles? The $9 cheese plate had three pieces of an overripe blue cheese the size of sugar cubes
Pricey, Impersonal and not particularly Spanish
how can we not go back? a wonderful tapas atmosphere, great quality of food, clean and casual
must go visit
better than going to spain, real deal paella, wonderful sangria and more at this tapas venture in tribeca
for sure the best spanish in NYC
No attention from servers on a slow sunday night
Food took too much time to get to our table and it was almost cold when it was supposed to be sizzling
Sour sangria - that is about it -that's what we got here
Will not go back there ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I came here the other night with my boyfriend who had a large gift certificate that he had gotten a while back
The gift certificate was not dated nor did it state the time policy on the gift certificate
When we presented to the waiter at the time of ordering we were told that we could not use the gift certificate
We were told all they would do was offer us a glass of wine
Needless to say we walked out of the restaurant after they were incredibly rude to us
but a friend of mine threw a party at the restaurant and the food that was being passed around by the cocktail servers was the best I've ever had at a party
I don't know if it was standard fare or something special they did just for the party, but I'll definitely be back to check out the full menu!
I went with a large group
The food was fantastic- the service was superb (and we had a large demanding group- so this was no easy feat)
The garlic shrimp, the tortilla espanolla and the champinones (mushroom) tapas were my favorites
The seafood paella was outstanding
Highly recommend checking this place out!
Our experience was average
I really enjoyed some of the other similarly priced restaurants
The ambience is very good
The crowd is great
The waiter was attentive and available although it was a Sunday
Made the reservations a day in advance and our need for a high chair for kids and they were very accomodating
The high chair was clean
The food was in general average and above average
The Paella (seafood) was OK, I have had better
The rest of the food was OK
We went and while it isn't the best tapa I've ever had stateside, it's quite good
The chorizo appatizer was the stand out and the calamari a close 2nd
The Savillana has thin slices of Manchego, firm poached pears in red wine, roasted fennel and greens
Very good
Perfectly seared sea scallops that were huge atop a mountain of mashed potatoes with a green sauce
More scallops and less potatoes would be an improvement
Shrimp and dates grilled and skewered were delicious
Seafood paella was well received too
For dessert, we had 2 Azafran variety plates with creme Catalan, flan, flourless chocolate cake, apple tart and a few others
All were quite good
Cappuccino and espresso were very good
Service was flawless and never excessive on a Saturday night
The wine list is a little disappointed both in selection and price
I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious food Azafran had to offer
Unfortunately this is not an everyday place to eat since after ordering only 2 tapas, 1 salad, 1 glass of wine and dessert and coffee the bill was well over $90
The service and ambiance were great
I would definitely go back
well, only if someone else is paying!
Azafran is on top of my list for horrible dining experiences
First, it was freezing inside
All of the diners next to us had coats on
When we spoke to the manager about the temp, they said there was nothing they could do about it
Unacceptable
NExt, our waiter's breath was atrocious
When we asked for olive oil for bread it tasted bitter
The sangria was DISGUSTINGLY sour and bitter as well
All we wanted to do was leave the restaurant, but our three tapas took 2 hours to get to us
Paella was salty and gross
And they had the nerve to charge ridiculous prices for the crappy food and swill served here
Overall this was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in NYC
Please stay away!!!
My girlfriends and I went here last night for our monthly girls night out dinner
Our whole experience at Azafran was amazing!!! The hostess was beyond accommodating, especially considering we changed our reservation from 5 to 8 people at the last minute
Our waiter was very attentive, making sure our glasses of wine/water were full at all times, in addition to recommending some wonderful items off the menu
I walked in to work the next morning and have already been spreading the word about Azafran 2 my coworkers - it's a definite must!!!!
Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions
Nice clean modern feel
chic tapas environment
I went with my husband and friends to Azafran
The sangria and tapas were so good, but the desserts were my favorite
We ordered the dessert tapas from the menu, an assortment of miniature desserts including creme catalan
So delicious! We had a good time sharing
We're going back again soon, just for dessert and coffee! I asked the manager who made the pastries, and he told me they have an in-house pastry chef that makes these lovely desserts
The pastry chef is obviously excellent!!
We went there last week
The service got really really bad
We had a reservation and got there all on time - we had to wait for 1 hour and 25 minutes and it was not even busy
The host pretended we did not exist-was hanging out with the waiters
When we sat down - our waiter did not know what to recommend - neither food nor wine
We got charged for two paellas BUT had only one
When we asked for the manager or the owner - neither one of them was available
Very dissapointing experience comparing to my last visit to Azafran about a month and a half ago and earlier
I don't know if I will come back
We recently had our rehearsal dinner at Azafran and the food and service was super
Hats off to the owners and the support staff, they have the right formula
I've been visiting Azafran Restaurant for the last 1,5 years and let me tell you what a wonderful place it is
The wine list, espacially the selection of the by glass ones, is graet
The tapas selection is amazing and tasts wonderfull
The atmosphere either for business or for a date fits the moment
This beautiful spot is a wonder

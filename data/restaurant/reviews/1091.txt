They try really hard, but sometimes you have to work smarter, not harder
Simply put, there are too many good, authentic Japanese restaurants in this neighborhood to waste an evening at Oyama
On the way back from shopping along 57th, I noticed that Oyama was a japanese newcomer to the neighborhood
I stopped in, and found a surprisingly fresh offering of sushi and sashimi and inventive menu from the kitchen - plenty of cooked entrees to explore! It really sets itself apart from the other sushi joints popping up all over the city, the decor wasn't (too) tacky, the waitstaff was still settling in but their helpfulness and eagerness made up for it
A great surprise was the incredibly tender baby lamb rib, done up teriyaki style
Far from just Negimaki (scallions wrapped with beef) that is traditionally offered in other sushi restaurants, Oyama had a large array of cooked dishes to offer
I'll definitely be returning to try them all
Me and few of my friends went to happy hour at this place and were treated EXTEREMELY rude by the owner of the restautant
He made us split up the tables that we were sharing, as he picked up our belongings and thew them out of the way
He walked away with no explanation or apolpgy
The waitresses we very nice and moved us to another table that was larger, however, we never recieved any apologies and were forced to pay our entire bill
I will never go back to this place, and I suggest going somewhere else next time you are considering going there
That is no way to run a restaurant
At last: the solid Mexican restaurant I've been searching for in NY! The margaritas are excellent - and, after being convinced to try them by friendly staff - we agreed their frozen versions are NOT watered down, as they are most places
I do not claim to be an expert on what authentic Mexican food is - and the menus isn't exotic - but I found the food to be well-seasoned, satisfyingly spicy, and yummy
The bar in front was very loud and quite crowded, but the diningroom in back was spacious and comfortable for conversation
Prompt and friendly service
Thanks!
In Short The suited-up inventors of the power meal are drawn in to this expense account heaven for steers with their peers
Lively business conversation booms throughout the elegant, wood-toned room as patrons consider simple offerings like shrimp scampi, lobster by the pound, crab cakes, lamb or veal chops, but they then order the giant porterhouse (the traditional favorite) anyway
The spacious bar is especially convenient for after-work, or after-dinner, cocktails
If you are setting up a business dinner and cannot decide where to go among the thousands of restaurants in the city, you can always count on Bobby Van's for great steak and excellent service
Great sliced porterhouse
Nice wine list as well
My father and I went to Bobby Van's on a Tuesday night
To start I had the escargots which weren't spectacular, but I got them because I think it's important to have fun
The real reason we were there, of course, was the main course: steak, and oh boy is it something
My dad and I split the Porterhouse for 2 (also available for 3 and 4) and the steak was the best I've ever had, bar none
They don't garnish it or adorn it like other places with sauces or seasoned skins, they just let the flavor of the steak speak for itself
Price tag was a little hefty, but it's well worth it, in my opinion
If you want a guy's night out to dinner and consider yourself a steak enthusiast, check out Bobby Van's
You won't be disappointed
It's loud, the waiters are brilliant, funny and attentive and the steaks, Chops and everything else are fantastic
The management is rude and the food is definitely not worth the skimpy service
Not worth the trip
chicken makhani,vegetable makhani, peshawri nan alone make it a worthwhile trip to this small restaurant
This food is so americanized it is gross
If you hate good Chinese then go here
If you're looking for a healthy meal, stop by this little joint
It took me a while to gather the courage to go in there, because their menu is so messy and disorganized
But finally one of the staff took me under his wing and explained my options to me and let me try their different foods
Ask to try the pates! They are delicious
It's a little pricey, but can be worth it
Their salads are filling especially when you choose to add a pate to it
Much recommended!
I liked Bonobo's and particularly want to balance out the previous reviewers
Sure the restaurant serves whacko raw food
If you have a problem with that, go somewhere else
I'm not a raw foodist, but I really enjoyed my meal
I've had similar food before so nothing was a revelation
But what I did find surprising about Bonobo is the value
This kind of food is normally pretty expensive, but last night we spent only marginally more than we would have at the Quizno's a few doors down
Don't expect this to be fast food as the counter-staff are really disorganized, but it's good, fresh, and interesting food at little more than fast food prices
Somebody forgot to tell Bonobo that organic vegetarian food does not have to be tasteless and bland
Over priced for counter service and an effortless cuisine
I can't tell what the big deal here is
I was told that everything on this place was organic and raw, well, the raw part turned out to be truth
The food is ok at best, really,nice salad, good juice and all, but at the prices they charge, one would expect at least a smile at the counter, but the idea there was more like we know everything, you know nothing, so don' ask stupid questions!! Judging by the large crowd there,I assume this place won't be there for long
I live at the capital building for about two years now lunch at antique cafe S U C K S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! turkey always drie, meat loaf disgusting and the pasta no taste at all
lately dinner is superp! but is a cool place always nice and clean
beutiful flowers a customer next door
As a waitress at the cafe, I found the previous negative review highly exagerrated
As we are a self seated cafe, it is absurd that it took this customer 15 minutes to sit
The staff is as genuine as one will ever find, we are not automatons like a McDonalds, but instead interesting diverse individuals who enjoy serving our wonderful food
Brunch weekends are very busy, regulars know to expect a leisurely meal
Do not expect instantaneous food, we are not a fast food establishment
Stay for great coffee, high quality food ( lobster blt, salad nicoise, a fabulous burger), fresh lemonades and ice teas, and decadent desserts
I go to the Broken Cup at least 4 times a week and I have a great time every time I go
It's great to go and meet with the people that live around there
The owners are really great people and the staff is equally personable, especially the one younger guy with the dark hair
It can sometimes get a bit cramped because of the small size, but the place is great and I recommend it to anyone who wants to kill some time with a cup of coffee and a great atmosphere
Stumbled across this place once for a cup of coffee, like it and came back, only to have a horrible experience with incredibly rude wait staff (one guy in particular)
I was ready/willing to chalk it up as one guy having a bad day, until the experience was shared by a neighbor a few months later
Very disappointing, as the food and casual ambiance were good (not great), but I certainly won't go back
I absolutely love this place
They steam their milk so the coffee and hot chocolates are absolutely amazing
I often come here with a book, and I always feel at home
They even have couches and chairs outside for when the weather is warm!
A diamond in the rough, the Broken Cup is great for escaping and getting work done
Only thing to add is a wireless internet connection and I'd practically move my office there
These sandwiches are juicy and delicious
I'm addicted to the Paola with aurora sauce
And the vibe is very cool - crowd is nice mix of Europeans and Columbia students
I love this place - the food is UNREAL
For the money you cannot possibly beat it
Highest priced entree is $15! It's a small and quaint place so have your expectations in check, but that doesn't mean anything bad - know going in that you are gonna eat some serious food!
The food at Ottomanelli is like no other i have ever tried
Its simply amasing no question about it
I'm positive that if you come here you will love it, theres no doubt in my mind
The people here are friendly they make you feel like if you where at home
In other fancy restaurants they dont give you the same service sometimes it feels like all they want is your money and a good tip
It's not like that in ottomanelli the people here make you feel important
I notice that the phones are always ringing like crazy and they still manage to give you a great service
I'm in love with this place and with its food
everything is good here the steak, pasta, burgers, and even the soups!!! and if you dont belive me why dont u go there for your self and find out
For a quick bite or relaxing no-frills quality meal, Ottomanelli's is the place
They have the best burgers uptown, no-holds bar
Large juicy steak burgers (quality meat) on a tasty, toasted brioche bun with great spicy waffle fries
Delmonico steak is a steal at $14
00 and salads are good, too

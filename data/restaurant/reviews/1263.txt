It was the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant!!!
On a recent return to the new Harlem Grill
I was dissappointed
They still don't have a soup of the day
The ran out of Ravioli
The replaced the ribeye (26
00 Ribeye!), with a flank steak, and the one Wasabi crusted Tuna that I had ordered, they ran out of
The fish and grit ( yes grit, one teaspoon) and the spinach that never came to the table was much to be desired
The Jumbo Lumb Crab cake, that I ordered, was actually fin and claw meat
Or a fraud
The owner apologize saying that he ran out of food from the night before
He offered us desert ( a scoop of sherbert and fruit) and promised to pay for my meal (which he didn't)
The service was slow and they had to explain to each patron what items were available
In fact, they had to make up dishes at one point!
We had lunch the other day at Paradisus 121 it was a joke
We had a very simple lunch order - cuban sandwich, chef salad, a special sandwich that was on the menu and an order of french fries
We tried to place the order and the waiter had no clue what we wanted even though we pointed it out on the menu
Instead of writing the name of the item we wanted he looked at the ingredients and wrote those down instead
He brought us back 2 turkey and cheese sandwiches which we didn't order and the fries were forgotten so they had to be cooked
We were there a really long time waiting on food (that wasn't the correct order) and then waiting to pay
I recommed that you walk right past this place
I have never had an order screwed up so badly
The Scene The Kati Roll Company's chic little sister lives a few steps below the street's bustle
Dramatic candlelit sconces and gilded mirrors hang from the walls, Billie Holiday and Joni Mitchell play overhead, and both the servers and the tables are dressed in white
Noisy street vendors seem worlds away, but the menu makes guests wonder if a troupe of them are hiding in the kitchen
The Draw In honor of Bengali street chefs, patrons taste fiery puffed rice served in a little brown bag
Bhekti, a native salmon-like fish is steamed in a paint-thinner-strength mustard sauce, but the chicken in a savory almond and melon seed sauce is pure joy
India's Anglo influence brings a sweet and succulent beef roast, and Muslim selections include gently spiced mutton in fluffy potato croquettes
From Tibet comes comparatively bland chicken momos
Fans of powerfully sweet Indian treats and rose-flavored pudding will dig the dessert menu
AMAZINGNYCs only Calcutta-style restaurant, featuring 2 unique elements: 1) celebrates Calcutta's ethnic/religious diversity, (noting Muslim, Anglo-Indian, Bengali, Chinese dishes); 2) each main dish comes with appropriate sides/bread!   YUMMY food-- beautifully displayed! NO excess oil
Each flavored differently, deeply, beautifully
Tomato beef concoction, flavored lightly with cardamom, was divine
Main dishes about $14-19 -- not cheap- but worth it
Drinks great too
Afterwards, stop upstairs at Kati Roll Company (same owner); for cheap yummy kati roll for lunch tomorrow
The young, enthusiastic, friendly staff spared no effort answering cuisine questions
My only advice is: increase portion sizes; and develop a special drink list
If you grew up in Calcutta, and have a bone to pick with food that doesnt exactly resemble your Mommys, go elsewhere
Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this beautiful hideway!   Its small, intimate; white/cream decor, featuring romantic flickering wall candles
GREAT for dates or celebrations! A gem
Was recommended to this place because they had mishti doi, and not only was that a completly laughable attempt at a Bengali dish (as were a couple of other awful dishes) but halfway through our meal, my date and I were actually ASKED TO MOVE TABLES so that another party could come into our places
Not wanting to cause a scene, we went ahead and moved, and when our entrees were served, the oiliness of the meal (over $60 a person) could have easily been matched by any local curry joint with probably better taste at a quarter of the price
Half of the wine list was unavailable, ambiance was tacky with lots of mirrors and not to forget that we were moved, making the experience worse
NOT RECOMMENDED! There is so much more that can't fit here
Blech!
New Indian restaurant - rumored to be a little 'different'
And yes it was
Subtle decor, above average wine list and a menu with a difference
But while the food was quite tasty, it would have to be with the amounts of oil going into it! There was more oil than chicken in my bowl of chaamp and definitely more oil than shrimp on my shrimp toast
Service was agonizingly slow and the waiters though nice are untrained kids
Desserts leave a lot to be desired - mediocre at best
Go for some tea instead which is charmingly served with a timer
My friends and I (many ardent Calcuttans among us) have been to Babu's several times in it's short span of existence
We have tried almost all the main courses, and several of the appetizers and desserts
Many aspects of Babu's suggest careful attention to detail: the menu (a narrow but wonderfully representative sample of Calcutta's cuisine), the presentation (the metal plates lend a pleasing touch of authenticity), the decor (subdued, but tasteful), and yes, even the restroon (amusingly retro-styled!)
It is unreasonable to expect an exact replica of the flavours and textures associated with dining in Calcutta, but this gem in the heart of the Village comes pretty darn close
Favourites: shaami kabab, fish fry, kosha manghso, mutton rezala, daab chingdri, sandesh, phirni
Misthi doi falls disappointingly short
Babu has great food that I haven't seen before in Indian restaurants in the US
The appetizers are all OUTSTANDING
The shrimp toast, mutton chop, chicken Momos and churmur were exceptional
For the entrees, we had the chicken champ which was delicious
The Kowswe, the shrimp cooked served in a coconut shell and mutton curry were also great
If you are having the shrimp with spicy garlic sauce , make sure to tell them if you do not want the sauce too spicy
Lovely table linen, antique mirrors a wall of flickering candles give this restaurant an understated and romantic feel
The restroom is a must- see   Babu is great to do drinks ( they have a good wine list) and appetizers with a group of friends or take a date for a romantic meal
The restaurant has a good ambience
The lighting and the decor are nice
However I can't say the same about the food
The attempt to create authentic Calcuttan food is still an attempt
The food fails to satisfy my Bengali taste buds
The Maccher Paturi needs a lot of work
The Daab Chingri is not recommended for sea food connoisseurs
Chicken Chap is no where close to its authentic roots
The accompaniments would satisfy the appetite of a pre-teen
For a person with a normal appetite, please ensure that you have had a pre-dinner snack, else you are going to end up at a nearby restaurant
The food is pricey; however if only the quantity could match the size of the large impractical cutlery, then it would be worth it
Service is slow and needs work
TRUE CALCUTTAN FOOD CONNOISSEURS WOULD FIND THIS PLACE A TOTAL LET DOWN
Don't think Indian restaurant when you walk in
The menu here is something special, a reflection of the eclectic cuisines of Calcutta
The various dishes are inspired by the Bengali, Muslim, Chinese, Anglo-Indian communities that have long inhabited the city -- and the result is no incoherent mish-mash
Also, be sure to try some of the Bengali fish entrees
Truly excellent!
I have to admit, I've only ordered Cobb salads
but I love this place, they have the best salads, ingredients are fresh and the dressing is good
There is sometimes a long line out the door but it's worth it - Chop't is much better than your average create-your-own salad establishment
Chop't has become my favorite lunch obsession, the palm beach shrimp with lemon / lime viniagrette is a MUST
The 10-vegetable is fantastic if you want just about the freshest and healthiest salad
For hangovers, the Po-Boy is a fave
The service is spotty; some days the salads and sandwiches are better than others
Delivery ranges from 20 minutes to sometimes a 1-hour wait
However, the amazing dressings, unlimited choices, and altogether fabulous salads make this place worth it!!!
considering you have to wait for weeks to get a reservation it is not worth it, other than the service nothing stands out
the food was average, the room was cramped and awkward for everyone-customers and servers
i was expecting something much more based off of all their good press but was disappointed
service was great however- friendly, professional, and on top of everything
it takes more than just a cute couple with a cute restaurant to last in new york, good luck spigolo!
Invited by friends to discuss business, I checked out the bar first, and didn't give my nme which was known to the owners Scott Heather

i dont know about you, but when i go out to dinner with my friends, we dont all order the same food
at carmines, even though the atmosphere was great, we were told that one order would be enough food for our group of 7
we couldnt agree on what to order, because we had to get an appetizer, a pasta, and a main course for ALL of us! some people in our group ended up being unhappy with their food, since we had to compromise
i recommend this place for families only!
Carmines rocks
Though its often difficult to get a table under 30 minutes, the wait is worth every second
Obvious caveat: its 'family style'
That means you can only sample two of their increadible dishes per 4 or 5 guests
Add an appatizer, and you'll be sending doggie bags home with everyone
Suggestions: Lemon Chicken, and the Riggitoni Contry Style
YUM
This place is a can't-miss with a large group of friends, the food is great and the portions are huge, making the price just right for starving New Yorkers! It is just sooo loud!
family-style serving
perfect for large groups or families
huge portions of food
not recommended if you are dieting :-)
Carmine's is our favorite place to go for large parties -- you get a ridiculous amount of food for reasonable prices
A bit loud, but fun if you bring a bunch of friends
Great meal, great atmosphere and wonderful waitstaff
Make a reservation beforehand, because it's always crowded
They give you an enormous amount of food for the money
And it's delicious! It's noisy, but the servers are great
Go on a Sunday or Monday, so you won't have to wait
You don't have to spend a fortune for good Italian food in New York
Bring a crowd when you go to Carmines because the portions are huge! Be prepared to share family style but, not to fork out a lot of money for a hefty bill
The waiters are really nice and they generally welcome a big group of friends
Everyone should go at least once
I loved this food! By far, it was the least expensive meal we ate in Manhatten, and it was easily in the top 3 of being the best
The waiter and servers were friendly and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was festive! And the restroom had a mouthwash dispenser! Go eat here!
I feel that Carmine's is the best casual Italian restaurant you can find in the Upper West Side
The food is great
The ambience is wonderful
Can be expensive, but you won't regret it
The wait is long but it will just allow you to savor the moment even more
I took my parents to this fast past/dinner-esque noodle restaurant in hope of a good meal without burning a hole in my wallet (or my stomach, for that matter)
Our waitress was unfriendly and seemed to be overwhelmed by the Sunday crowd
The restaurant was also a bit noisy, but aside from those two negatives, everything turned out great
Their hot and sour soup was loaded with vegetables and had a mild enough zing to clear my sinuses
For the main course, we shared the chicken and eggplant with garlic sauce (highly recommended for eggplant lovers!), the beef with snow peas (also tasty) and pork lo mein (the best noodles I've had in a long time)
The bill was relatively inexpensive for 3 soups and entrees of great quality chinese food
Again, I highly recommend this restaurant
It's a shame that it's not good, a little greasy, and generally unpleasant since it's so nearby
My scalion pancake was small and burnt and they tried to get jazzy with the egg drop soup (i think they added corn
why?) and salmon fried rice needed a little more umph
Small portions, indifferent service
hmm
what can i say about ollies? well the waiters could care less about but the food and price is great
if ur on a low budget and have a craving for chinese food, this is the place to go
also the place is so big, u never have to wait to be seated!
Rude, rude, rude
We called in an order for delivery
The person on the phone 'tsked' her tongue repeatedly and whined when we had to ask repeatedly for her to repeat the order, then hung up on us before we could confirm
When we called back to cancel the order and talk to a manager, a different person came on, said our order wasn't in, and said 'ok, bye' and hung up on us _again_ after we asked to talk to a manager!
the food was good and it came quick
its a place to go if you dont have all the time in the world for lunch and want to get something quick
my favorite has to be the sesame chicken and the noodles are pretty amazing also
Although its good that the food comes quickly i also felt a little rush
I guess it depends on who your waiter is like any other restaurant
Talk about a breath of fresh air in the hustle bustle of Times Square
Ollie's offers an extensive menu ranging from hot noodle soups to traditional Asian noodle dishes
Relatively inexpensive considering you're in the heart of Manhattan
Clean and open atmosphere
Great place to load up on carbs to boost your energy level
helping to continue your journey through NYC!
The food was good, but the place was very crowded
As a periodic visitor to Ny, I always make it a point to eat at Ollie's
The food is fresh, flavorful, and fast
Our entire family agrees that Ollie's House of Noodles most regularly gives us the best eating in Manhattan
Other restaurants can be stupifyingly expensive for mediocre food
For cheap and delicious, Ollie's wins
I went to Ollies with my friends, and I have to admit, I don't see the fuss
The service was decent and food served timely, but the taste was certainly nothing memorable
The servings were small and food taste like takeout
Save your money and go to Flushing
I have eaten at a few Ollie's branches, a few times each and have gotten mixed results
The very first time I went it was not crowded (rare, but it happens) and I had VERY good food - dumplings and steamed veggies
The service was great
On other times i haven't been so lucky
Bad service and rush-job food
So take your chances - but at these prices (very low) you can't lose much and if you go at a non-peak time (like a Monday or Tuesday night) you'll likely have a good experience
A must for college students or anyone on a budget
(Who likes Chinese food
)
The cold sesame noodles and sesame shrimp are my favorite dishes at this fun, fast and cheap place
Great for groups and sharing dishes
The scallion pancakes and soups are good
most everything else is ok
The lunch specials are reasonably priced, but I avoid this place when I can only order off the regular menu
It's a little too pricey for fast-food chinese, in my opinion
You can't go wrong at Ollie's
The food is awesome and the price is unbeatable
The waiters couldn't care less about anything but turnover, but you'll forget all about that when you take your first bite
Kung Pao Chicken has a few too many peanuts (ask for less, but good luck with compliance) but it's excellent
Hot and Sour Soup melts in your mouth
I always enjoy eating here and try to do so whenever I'm in this area
The food is of a much higher quality than all of the nondescript Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood
The service is good, the food tastes fresh, and even the fried dishes are not too heavy or too breaded
I highly recommend it, especially the noodle dishes!
I've tried Ollies a few times since it's near work, but it's generally been subpar
I like the scallion pancakes and a few other dimsum items, but the main dishes are generally not that flavourful and terribly overpriced!

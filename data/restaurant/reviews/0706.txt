But I came in tonight with a group of friends, absolutely hypnotized by the food, beautiful atmosphere, and gorgeous greek god of a waitor
The shortbeef is out of this world, definitely have to try! Also everyone should save room for the choc tarte, that was to die for
If I can say anything to agave, it would be to do something about the air and the washrooms
Too hott!   Overall enjoyed and highlly recommend!
I've been frequenting this place since it first opened and have yet to be anything but overwhelmed by the amazingly creative dishes, efficient and professional service, and classy southwestern ambiance of this inexpensive joint in an otherwise sea of overpriced food
This past week, I was lucky enough to try the pecan crusted trout with chipotle sauce
The portions were big and the price was not! ($18)
As always - the best Marguerita's in town!
I planned my best friends baby shower here
The place was recommended for large parties but instead of the usual big table, we had the event in the new private dinning room
Beautiful! The room is just off the main dinning area
It was perfect for 30 people
We had our own waiters
The food was great (we had a special menu put together), timing was perfect and everyone very sweet
I look forward to trying them out for dinner
My friends and I were looking forward to celebrating a friends 29th B-day on 7/22/06
My friend was looking forward to her favorite dish on the menu had made reservations for the 14 of us a few weeks beforehand
We were looking forward to a night filled with good food service, but things dont always go as planned
Little did we know that large groups could only order off the banquet menua menu thats at least 1/3 the size of the regular menu
We politely asked our server for the regular menu, but were told that for large parties they could only offer us the banquet menu (would have gone elsewhere had we known)
We asked for the manager she explained to us that their chef couldnt accommodate such a large group with the regular menu
When we explained to the manager that we were not told this, she said there was no way we could not have been told this! Rather than politely apologize for us not receiving notice, she began arguing with us
She informed us that this was told to us in our reservation confirmation
However, we were never told this (doubled checked the email confirmation-nothing was said)
Good customer service mandates a diplomatic explanation as to why we had to be given the banquet menu
Note: We would have understood had the manager not been so impolite
She finally agreed to let us order from the regular menu, but we werent allowed to order quesadillas (some of us were disappointed!)
To top off our bad experience, we had brought cupcakes for our friends birthday were told that wed be charged $3 a piece just to eat our cupcakes
We were not told this beforehand (even though we informed the restaurant beforehand)
While Agave has great food margaritas, the service (and especially the managers argumentative behavior) turned us all off
There were 14 and many of us had been there for the first time
NYC has many places with great food margaritas
We're not returning
Had a great time
Brought my parents for their anniversary and the people could not have been kinder
Our waitress was attentive and made my parents feel special
The food was really good
Th only glitch it got really hot at one point
Thats what frozen margaritas are for I guess
Had been there before and was right to go back for this special event
Lets just say I felt so uncomfortable at the restaurant that both my fianc and I were left wondering Am I welcomed here? Besides being ignored most of the night by our waitress in a very suspicious manner, the food and drinks were worse than Chilis or any other Southwestern restaurant chain! Maybe it was an off night for the cooks, but it cannot be that off
Half of our food did not make it to the table and the items that did, were lifeless
I was so disappointed because Agave was highly recommended by my friends and now they feel terrible about that manner in which we were treated and the terrible food
Agave is a nice restaurant with good dishes
it's a good restaurant particularly for couples because that's what they seem to cater to
It's a little cramped because of just how many people want to eat there but the outdoor dining in the summer gives you a little breathing room
The only thing which is a glaring negative is the service which is sub par due to the gross overcrowding
If you want a restaurant that's packed like a lounge but has good food, this is a spot to visit
My wife and I were there on the 3rd of July and completely enjoyed our experience
The drinks were very good and strong
we had herradura margaritas
The food was also above our expectations
We love mexican food that actually has flavor and spice and this place has it
Unlike Dos Caminos, Agave is definitly a great dining experience
The appetizers were amazing and the entree was even better
I would definetly recomend this resturant to anyone searching for upscale mexican food
Compared to other resturants I have been to in the city, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous
EXCELLENT!!!!!
Went to Agave for my birthday
The food was good but took too long to arrive
The nice suprize from the restaurant was a free desert cake
Overall, average experience, probably would go somewhere else next time
The Margaritas are excellent
The first time I ate there the food was amazing, the second time I had a quesadilla which was just a quesadilla
I'm not sure I'd give the restaurant a 9
7 which is walks on water but I'd still give it a good review
If you go expecting everything that goes with a 9
7 you may be disappointed, its good but not OMG I can't live without it
I went there only once on my trip to NY
The food was really excellent
Many entrees are between $15 and $20 (you can decide if you think that is cheap or expensive)
The restaurant is not very spacious though
The next table was about one foot away, and we could clearly hear all conversation on the tables to the left and the right
The service was average, but there were no major reasons to complain
I would definitely go back there for the food and the atmosphere
i made a reservation at agave for a friend who was moving away
we all liked the brunch items we had but when we later asked if the chips were supposed to come with the meal, the waitress explained it away by saying sometimes they forget instead of apologizing and offering something extra
they were also doing construction right next to us
the hostess not only didn't offer an apology but asked us to sit in that particular location in the first place
the prices are fairly typical ny prices at about $15-$20 per person
while the food is above average, i would recommend going somewhere else
given the way we were treated, it's obvious that they don't care about their customers
I took my wife to a play and dinner
I called for reservations, but Saturday 05/22/2006 was filled
We stopped by anway and the hostess, Cecille found us an immediate romantic table
Hey, the entire place is romantic! The appetizer of Hand Hacked Haas Avocado Guacamole with Blue Corn Tostados was excellent! The entrees of Pan Roasted Breast of Chicken and Cider Brined Pork Tenderloin were equally delicious!! The dessert we tried was ridiculously good!!! The meal was not expensive at all
The staff was attentive, quick and kind
This is a speical place for cozy dinners
Guys, if you screwed up recently or need to build brownie points, take her to AGAVE!
Drown in the luscious flavors and slurpy textures of the freshest mango and passion-fruit margaritas around
The brunch is super - blueberry pancakes with lemon cream cheese and maple syrup are good enough to leave an impact through the margarita haze while the huevos rancheros are just excellent
We started with the golden fried crunchy goodness of calamari which I highly recommend, along with the yummy herb speckled scrambled eggs
Went here last night with my friend
We were seated outside since it was a gorgeous night
It was a little cramped, but we didn't mind
We both ordered margaritas and they were excellent! Especially the fresh strawberry margarita
We had delicious guacamole to start- highly recommended and I had the grilled shrimp taco, which was excellent
My friend had the lobster quesadilla which was also very tasty
Service was very good
I thought the prices were a little high, but it was worth it

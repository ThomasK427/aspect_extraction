There is nothing wrong with Starbucks coffee
Because it is everywhere, I know that no matter where I go, once I step into a Starbucks, I am guaranteed to have a good cup of coffee
As far as the price goes, 4 dollars for a cup of coffee is really not that expensive in Manhattan
There are plenty other caf/dessert places that charge much more for coffee and tea
Not to mention, most of the restaurants charge me 5 bucks for a cup of plain, nothing-to-it, regular coffee
In Short Everyone knows Krispy Kreme takes donut-making seriously, even the Smithsonian which has archived company equipment
But customers gather in the starkly lit, white tiled shops or at food court outposts to await the HOT sign's illumination (which indicates a fresh batch), not a history lesson
Still-warm glazed originals have been the company's mainstay since 1937
Over a dozen other variations are offered--chocolate iced, traditional cake, and lemon-filled, among them-yet simplicity reigns supreme

The best there was
The best there'll ever be
You'll never go back
Homer Simpson would love this place
they have the best glazed donuts I have ever eaten
hands down the best
these dounts are so good it's hard to describe in words
plus they have a bunch of other flavors besides the glazed that are worth a try  trust me on this one
Krispy Kreme is no longer a secret so this info isn't really groundbreaking
but do yourself a favor and try their donuts!!
I actually prefer the one on 23rd street because there are no seats in Penn Station in which to sit and enjoy your excellent boiling hot coffee and your little holy joyous bundle of dough, most likely due to the extreme panhandling problem
Staff seems happier at Penn Station, however, and are quick to help you and make sure you have all the sugar and stirrers you need
I like how they put a soda cup lid over the coffee before putting the coffee lid on -- avoids spills! The donuts are excellent
I miss the rainforest crunch limited edition donuts
:(
my fifteen year old son eats nothing but pizza
but while we were visiting family in north carolina
he discovered his first krispy kreme
he plowed his way through an entire dozen! this past christmas
he was thrilled to get his very own krispy kreme t-shirt
and wears it proudly
he is a number one fan!!
than a Krispy Kreme doughnut fresh out of the oven
Just a ball of sweet greasy doughy delight
A far greater joy than Dunkin could ever dream of
In Short Since first opening in 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill
, McDonald's has become one of the most recognized brands in the world
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
from the legendary Big Mac to new and exciting menu items like Chicken Parm and the Big Extra Mickey D's is always expanding their menu! where else can you get a full dinner for $5 bucks? a burger, some fries and a nice big Coke, it's the American dream meal!! just count your blessings that there is a Mickey D's on every corner in America! we are the luckiest people in the World!
All I can say is magnificent!
The pastries, danish, cookies are all superb in this small West Chelsea Bakery
Everything seems to be made like they would do in a small Parisienne Bakery
The surroundings make it a little difficult to locate, but once you try their almond croissants or tuiles you'll never forget where to find it
The place itself is small and cozy with cute french posters and pictures of some of the chefs more creative creations on display
If you ever need a beautiful wedding cake, birthday cake, or even just a croissant and a coffee this is the spot
The price is just right as well
I had their bagels - plump and chewy and they dont skimp on the cream cheese
The soups are rich and tasty (tasted minestrome)
(prices are a lil high for soup but worth it)  I would recommend them for taking a light meal on the go
So good
Probably all chemicals, but whatever
The flavor selections are awesome -- I could eat this stuff for every meal
The Scene Inconspicuous Bottino is an ideal stop for a light lunch or full dinner while gallery-hopping through Chelsea
The space is clean and airy, with dark wood floors, whitewashed brick and a partially open kitchen
A small mahogany bar and cocktail tables sit near the entrance, while a tranquil, ivy-festooned garden waits out back
Service can vary from competent to distracted
The Food While the rustic Italian menu offers few epiphanies, it's hearty, well-executed and generally satisfying
Straightforward appetizers like grilled eggplant, an antipasto plate and a tomato and arugula salad with shaved pecorino are standouts
Main courses like roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and haricot verts, spaghetti with clams and a gutsy penne with speck also hit the mark
UPON TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY, I WAS TOLD ABOUT BOTTINO
I CHECKED OUT THE WEBSITE AND LOOKED GREAT
I CALLED, MADE A RESERVATION FOR MY PARTY WHICH WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE
UPON ADDING TO THE PARTY I WAS TOLD OF A PRIX FIXE, AND THEY EMAILED IT TO ME
I WROTE THE MANAGER AND LET HIM KNOW HOW UPSETTING IT WAS THAT IT SPRUNG UP LATER THAN UPON THE INITIAL RESERVATION
HE THREW IT OFF ON HIS LACKING STAFF, AND OFFERED ME A DISCOUNT OF ABOUT 1%
I WROTE BACK AND EXPLAINED HOW I WAS NOT INTERESTED, WHICH STARTED A WHOLE BARRAGE OF NASTY EMAILS FROM THE MANAGER
FINALLY AFTER BEING TOLD IT'S BEST FOR BOTH OF US I OPTED TO TELL OTHER USERS OF THIS HOSTILE SITUATION
IF YOU WANT A HARD TIME THEN ENJOY! IF YOU WANT REAL CLASS TRY THE RED CAT!
i think that the food is well executed and the staff great fun
always get looked after and would recommend it to anybody
i've never had a problem but i can imagine that it can get super-busy with a small impact on service
but not for me so far
Slow bad service, bad food, charged for items I didn't order
I'm so tired of being ripped off
If your an artist and are upset and want to be bratty at dinner because you just realized that other people's art is in gallarys and your isn't- this is not the spot for you
Yes, the waitstaff is not amazing, it may take them a WHILE to notice you but the food is great and so is the ambiance
The truth is things go wrong at any dinning experience, especially in a busy restaurant
So take someone you know and want to spend time with and enjoy the great food and time for conversation!
This place is so stuck-up and pretentious, only God himself would get the slightest bit of their attention
The waitstaff got our order wrong
The fish was over cooked
They moved us to another table midway through our meal
Could not get a glass of wine, until we asked several times
If you want to be ignored, thrown an attitude, eat sub-par food at an overpriced restaurant, I urge you to go to Bottino
Bottin is still great after many years already! the garden is beautiful
The food is simple and unpretentious and consistent year after year
I have always loved coming here 9as has most of the New York art world) and I enjoyed their new place, Bivio, this week, too
Two thumbs up for both ---four thumbs in total!
You couldn't tell by the demure front of this restaurant but the back is an oasis away from the city
I felt like I was dining in a vacation spot when the party I was with was seated in the outdoor patio area
I wouldn't mind eating in the main dining room but the garden in the back is what makes this place special and romantic
The service was spotty as a couple of drink orders were forgotten and the waiter didn't really come to check on us
But the food was delicious albiet a bit plain
I guess the minimalist choices on the menu matches the minimalist decor
Overall, I good place to take a date or have a small group of friends for dinner
Beautiful, hip crowd and generous portions of very classic, simple, fresh Italian food
Waiters were perfectly nice and attentive
We had a great time and will come back again! The garden was really an unexpected treat!

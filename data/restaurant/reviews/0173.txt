We'll definitely go back
Our server was efficient and had the most wonderful smile
We love this place!
I dont usually write reviews
but I really had to say something about this experience
Went to dinner a couple Sundays ago and the food was mediocre at best
The pork tenderloin was suppose to be stuffed, but it came with just a hole in the middle, the bread was dry and the vegetable oily!! my boyfriend had the snapper and it was rubbery and tasteless
It felt like they threw leftovers on the plate and gave it to us
But because the wine was so good we went to give it another try this Sunday, again the food was not edible
I hate to write bad things but for the price we paid, we felt like we were robbed
If you come
come for wine, the best in the W
Village!!! but the food is just insulting to the intelligence of any New Yorker with standards
Well
we came in for dinner, it was not too busy and the host sat us by the window
As we looked at the menu, they gave us a venison terrinne with an onion marmalade to nibble on
it was a shame that was not on the menu, it exploded with so much flavor
The food was great
I recommend getting the octopus and the steak!!! Everything was perfect, the custard cakes and some espresso made for a perfect end to the meal
Will be back again
We got seated right away, We got a nice starter from the kitchen, unfortunately the waiter that brought it could not explain what it was, it was delicious though
We started with the Chorizo, Clams in Sparkling wine, grilled octopus and the pork belly
All great!! maybe a little more octopus but it tasted amazing
Snapper was crispy and flaky
The steak on the stone made the table smell amazing, the Codfish gratin was creamy and the duck best we've ever tasted
The wine list was a little daunting but the bottle suggested was perfect
Desserts were a bit less stellar, we were expecting more, but the molten chocolate cake was perfectly done (alot of egg base desserts)
The waiter was a little unattentive at times but was very cordial and friendly when he was there, but We all highly recommend this place and will be back
As a party of two, we were given the choice of a cramped table by the front door or a cramped table by the bathroom and kitchen despite it being a relatively slow night, being well dressed and having reservations
We took the table by the front door, which might have been a mistake since several of the waiters and maitre d hung out right by our table waiting for guests to arrive
The wait staff was not as attentive as I would have liked, we had to ask several times for water and refills of water, and after the food was served, no one returned to check on us
That being said, the chorizo appetizer and filet mignon entree were divine and the wine selections are top notch
My dining experience at Alfama is really something to rave about!! It has a new chef and if we loved the food before, we think it is now just outstanding!
and for great value, too! They have the freshest seafood and as a meat lover, Bife na Pedra, a great organic filet mignon is unbeatable! Wines
the best selection I have ever seen! On a Sunday, the pre-fixe brunch options are also a fantastic value! I was actually in for dinner this week again and Alfama is just my favorite restaurant in NYC! I highly recommend it!
Very disappointed with the food and the cost
We ordered the steamed clams and they were full of sand
not just a couple of granules but alot
Yuck
Maybe we should have listened to the waiter who was pushing the scallops
Next, I had the shrimp with wild rice
Nothing special at all
the shrimp were OK and the rice was ok but $30
00 bucks for ok? My friend ordered the lamb dish which was dry and bland
Please believe me, we Love food and this place was below par
Don't waste your money when there are so many great restaurants in NYC
I took my boyfriend to Alfama for his birthday and it was wonderful
He is Portuguese, and he was delighted because the food is completely authentic
I was delighted because it was delicious, made to standards of an upscale Manhattan restaurant (which you often don't get in ethnic restaurants)
The selection of Portuguese wines is great, with many excellent bottles to choose from in the under-$40 range
The interior is warm and inviting, if a bit smalll noisy
Service was prompt and unobtrusive
$140 for dinner for 2 of this quality (including apps, desert a bottle of wine) was well worth it
This is currently my favorite restaurant
I went for thr first time about 3 years ago and just went back
The clams Alfama, hot stone filet mignon and shell steak were fabulous
When we told them our reservation was for a special occasion, we got a cozy corner booth and complimentary appetizer and dessert
I love Alfama!!!
I took my boyfriend to Alfama for his birthday-- it was the first time either of us had eaten there
The appetizers, wines (port, white red), main courses and chocolate dessert were a taste buds' paradise
We will definitely be returning! We sat in a romantic nook, where the wait staff never missed a beat
The service was incredible,  and I still cannot stop thinking about the food
(3 days later)
My wife and I travel a lot threw this world on business and pleaser
We love to eat well
Alfama servers an excellent taste and portion of Portuguese cuisine like no other
We feel that they have combined the recopies of Portugal and master them in North America
Alfama is truly one of our favorite restaurants and we judge all others to them
We wish them all the best

My parents and I were recently in New York and being Portuguese we decided to visit this restaurant
The Caldo Verde was exactly the way my mother makes it, simply delicious
Everything was impeccable from the food to the dcor
The ambiance was rustic mixed with Manhattan chique
When you're in New York, be sure to visit Alfama
Bom apetite!
In one word, Alfama is simply SUPERB! Delicious, lovingly prepared food using the freshest ingredients
The wine list is a treasure trove! Try the Aliana Do Particular 1992, which is a bargain at $95
I had it last night and it's drinking beautifully
It can easily be compared to an expensive French burgundy, for which you'd pay at least $400 a bottle
The staff is gracious, knowledgeable and very helpful
Live Fado on Wednesday nights is a charming and transporting experience
As I said, SUPERB!
I was disappointed with the food
My seafood whatever was burnt
And the portion was too small for the price
I had never had Portugese cuisine before this place
And I certainly had no idea what it's supposed to taste like when I left
But like I said, the facade is pretty and makes the neighborhood look nice
Excellent food and wine list
Staff is excellent and helpful
The dishes range from simple to unusual and everything is delicious
Highly recommend Alfama!
Over the years I have taken guests to Alfama
We have never been disappointed
The quality of the food is quite excellent
The place is airy and nicely decorated
It is comfortable
Highly recommended
Exellent food

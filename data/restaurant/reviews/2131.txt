The tiramisu was excellent, and we also enjoyed the warm chocolate cake
I would not recommend this place, because we ended up spending about $30 a head, and we left unsatisfied
that matter most
How hard is it to make a perfect minestrone? Then how come nobody does it like these guys? Like so many of the simple straightforward items DaCiro serves, every element of this classic soup are perfect: crispy vegetables, flavorful broth, exact seasoning and, most important, delivered piping hot
And the foccaccia robiola? One of the best foods I've ever had in a restaurant
I really enjoyed this restaurant
I have been there 3xs now and each time I go I am pleased with everything
In a neighborhood with not enough diners, the Sunflower survives in spite of being average
It closes at midnight, even on Friday and Saturday night - missing the late night munchies crowd
It doesn't make the regular Jewish staples of potato pancakes and blintzes
BUT, it does have a nice atmosphere with cheerful tile decor
The waiters are attentive and pleasant
the specials taste great and are only about $18 but beware since after you ask for the check they bring by a platter of desserts to tempt you
but you'll later find that the desserts are a bit pricey at $8 each
but the main problem here is the ambiance
the place is a bit dingy and the lights were sooo dark my gf and i were wondering what else they were trying to cover up
well, we soon found out! halfway through dessert, a ro-ach climbed onto our table
the wait staff was non-plussed and one waiter shrugged and remarked hey, we're just a restaurant
Our latest trip to Alba was the best dining experience of my life
Alba is romantic, quiet, and most importantly the food is excellent
I had a special, linquini with shellfish including a full pound of lobster in a Fra Diavolo sauce
I called the waiter over twice to profess my love for the dinner and express my thanks
My girlfriend had the Veal Parmigiana
Every time we've gone to Alba the veal has been very tender, nice and thin, and well balanced
The prices were surprisingly low
The lobster-seafood linguini was only $32 which is amazing when you consider it was a full seafood meal PLUS a lobster
The veal was only $16
We just sat for 10 minutes after the meal just savoring the experience we just had
The service is superb
We basically had 6 different waiters attending to us (probably because it was a Monday night)
They were attentive without being intrusive
I recommend the veal
And the tartuffo for dessert
This is the restaurant in which my boyfriend of 5 years proposed to me
It will always hold a special place in my heart and I couldn't imagine anywhere better
The food was amazing and the ambience was majestic
I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys fine Italian dining, friendly service, and a romantic setting
I owe the owners of Trattoria Alba everything and I couldn't thank them enough
I had a private party at the restaurant back in late February
The room I had which was upstairs was very nice and big
The food was good and overall the service wasn't bad
The party menus were vey reasonably priced
The staff was very accomodating and I wouldn't hesitate to have dinner there or to throw another party there
I decided to try this restaurant after reading about it on citysearch, and I was very satisfied with the experience I had
First, the atmosphere is very understated, yet manages to carry a certain elegance
The service is good, and while it is nothing spectacular, it accomplishes its mission
Aside from the charming atmosphere, the reason to come here is for the food
The portions are generous; I ordered a stuffed veal chop, and it was without question bigger than the veal chops served by other restaurants
The desserts were good, reasonably priced, and nothing special
Of course, after the amount of food they give you, you may not have room for desserts
In that case, I recommend relaxing with a cup of espresso or coffee
This great Italian restaurant, has big portions and a nice decor
Charming for date
Steak was Ok, my fault though, never order in a italian rest
try the antipasto as well
I've been to Alba twice, and both times have been overwhelmed by what an overall great experience it had been
The food could not be better
They start you with warm bread and free brushetta
WE got the portobello mushroom appetizer, which was perfect
I've had their pasta twice, and both times could not have been happier with it
I've recommended the place to many people, all who have felt the same way as I do
It is the best Italian rest I have ever been to
Perfect service and also a terrific atmoshphere
It was my girlfriends birthday last week, so I decided to take her to Trattoria Alba after hearing great things about them from my friends and also the Zagat survey
Everything went wonderful and she had the time of her life
The bill was a great value for all the food they gave us and the service was wonderful
They did everything that was needed and because of that, I had a great night
I will definitely be going back as soon as possible
Waitress didnt know what shellfish was! How can you work at a restaurant that serves seafood, and not know what one of the biggest allergies is? She brought me out shrimp
even after i specifically told her i was allergic
Beware to otheres with allergies
The food was average, nothing to really rant or rave about
just typical
a friend took me there bc he enjoyed his first visit there
i ordered the tempura udon and honestly, i expected it to be better
the broth was sweet and i had to add pepper to compensate for the sweetness
i tried some of my friends' dishes and those seemed decent
the restaurant is small and cozy
the waitstaff was very eager to help
honestly, it seemed like many typical small japanese restaurants in manhattan
i wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if i happened to be in the area, i wouldn't mind going again
the prices could also be a bit more competitive
I ordered 2 uni, 2 salmon, 2 unagi, and a spicy scallop hand roll
and a miso
and an ice tea
I walked out of there 40 bucks later after tip - not crazy for sushi, but certainly not what I would consider affordable
That said, the service was friendly and prompt, the sushi was top quality, and I will go here again
Just don't expect to order a la carte and get out of there for 10 bucks
I am a pure vegetarian and most of the Japanese places you gotta be careful
Waitress took way too long to tell me what this one thing was
She ignored us until my friend got really frustrated and asked her to find out right now, becuase technically we can't eat till then
She was also sorry for her being delayed since they were extremely understaffed
only 2 waitresses in the whole place
Other than that food's good
I've been going to Mishima for about 6 years now and find it to be the best mix of fresh food and not mega-crazy expensive
The key is the master sushi chef who operates on the second floor only
The downstairs portion is geared towards non-regulars and take-out orders
Before ordering any fish, you have to find out the specials of the day
Or, if you have a little more change in your pocket, sit at the master sushi chef's counter and ask for the best fishes of the day
He will load you up with two sushi pieces at a time of the best fish available that day

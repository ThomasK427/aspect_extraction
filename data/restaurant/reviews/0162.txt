For appetizers, ordering Quacamole is a must
They make it fresh right at your table, so even non-avocado fans (me) will enjoy it
My dinner was a perfectly done Filet Mignon with a wild mushroom tequila sauce
They have wonderful desserts as well, but what was different was there extensive list of after dinner drinks
I've never seen so many ways to mix coffe and hot chocolate with liquor
The waitstaff isn't stuffy
The armosphere is great, including the waterfill which just has to be seen to be believed
A wonderful choice for any occasion
The guacamole is truly out of this world and their margaritas are a treat too, the rest of the meal is better than average, but not by much
If you don't mind dropping a small fortune, you won't be disappointed in your meal here
The portions are miniscule and expensive
Although what little was on my plate was delicious, it seemed too little for what I paid
Oh, and the guac was amazing!! Excellent margaritas, but again, very small in context of what I was paying
One major complaint was the pushy service
Completely tried to upsell EVERYTHING on the menu
Handed the menu, and went on a ten minute tangent about what he suggested
and it wasn't even sincere
just scripted off of what a manual must have said
Also, make SURE you get a seat upstairs!!
Yes, I know the title is cheesy, but its the best guacamole I've ever had!! Watch out for the pomegranate margaritas
Good, but very strong and can induce a raging hangover
Good scene for the thirty something crowd
I've been here a few times now and the last time was the best
The guacamole is an appetizer for a reason--it doesn't get any better
Filet mignon is excellent, as are the little quesadillas
I think some people who come here don't like it because they're used to Americanized Mexican--this is as close to the real thing as you'll get in New York
The Scene Roc's decor mixes high and low elaborately
It's ostensibly fine dining, but with a penchant for the gloriously kitschy; for better or worse, the ghosts of mom-and-pop joints breathe in the woodwork
The decor is eclectic--wine bottles are perched along the walls, a large chandelier shares ceiling space with lights that resemble upside-down hubcaps, and the china doesn't match
The Food The focus may be on the seafood-heavy peninsula of Sorrento, but there are also plenty of dishes drawn from a more expansive Italian repertoire
The food is best at its most straightforward--paper-thin prosciutto with figs, or an acetic spinach and endive salad with bacon and lemon vinaigrette
Other options range in quality from just-better-than-good to impressive
Numerous variations on fish broths are offered, but the baby mussels and Manila clams with which they're studded are a bit lacking
Cozy space and decor, inconsistent food
My friend loved the Swordfish topped with horseradish mashed potatoes special, however I found my fish entree to be lacking
Avoid the fried calamari and zuchini app - lots of fried zuchinni and very little calamari for $13
Overall a bit pricey for the experience
Owner rocco has been in NYC since 1990 and he can treat New Yorkers with savvy attitude,
The food is great, the wine list superb
try the lamb chops in a potato crust
amazing i suggest a resrvation, because its always busy,great celebrity spotting
or you can ship your party off to Brooklyn to his new place 'baci e abbracci' in williamsburg were partner paolo and mimmo run the show , where they serve the best pizza napoletana
both place roc and baci e abbracci are my top choice
buon appetito !  jessicaan
Worst meal of my life
Appetizer: scallops w/ 3 pine nuts on bed of crunchy, inedible eggplant pieces
Entree: veal piccata w soggy breading covered with sauteed, tough artichoke heart pieces served w/ tough stringy spinach
Dessert: cheesecake? similar to grocery store mix for fake cheesecake
Bore no resemblance to cheesecake
Totally tasteless
Add $15 martinis and you have the picture
I dissuaded a patron at the door from coming in
Only fun I had all night
Overall, I was hoping for more
The food was ok, the service was ok and the bill seemed a little costly for what we got
While I would return if some of my Tribeca favorites were too crowded, the Roc is not top on my list
Biggest complaint - the pasta and sauces were just ok, and not close to great or tasty
Crabcake appetizer and fruit tart dessert were good
Pasta dishes were average - my friend's cavatelli with sausage and rabe seemed tasty while the scialiatelli with lobster/crab was uninspiring
A great and expansive, appropriately Italian heavy wine list was nice but approximately double wine markups put the majority of wine over 100 a bottle with probably less than 2 dozen under 50
Overall, nice ambience with great outdoor dining, but you could do better
We stopped in on our way to Thalassa because it was so cold outside we couldn't make it the other three blocks
What a pleasant surprise! They had a very eclectic menu, a lot of thoughtful specials, and very nice service
The food was delicious and beautifully prepared and presented
My dad even liked it, and he doesn't like anything!
Good italian food but lack of refinement (regarding the reputation of the establishment)
Friendly staff though too much familiar
Nice terrasse and elegant decoration
I had lunch with my colleague at Roc's recently
Although the cost was reasonable for the three-course prix fixe ($20
02pp) including coffee (a plus!), the service was a bit spotty
Our waiter (a real cutie) had to ask us twice for our entree selections, the coffee orders were wrong and after saying, no, thanks, the pepper man poised his mill above my friend's calamari dish and ground away
Maybe it was a language thing, maybe it was an off day
Who knows, but the food was delish
The calamari was tender in a light sauce, the farfalli with lamb also cooked well and very flavorful
Desserts and the appetizer selections were tasty and plentiful
Go!
My fiance and I are new to the area, but feel right at home when visiting Roc
From the laid back ambience, non-pretentious and always personal service, the great Italian eats , and of course, Rocco--one of the most good spirited, gracious and modest hosts a newcomer can have
--We love Roc and glad to have our neighborhood spot
Great food
Friendly service
Warm atmosphere
And the always gracious host--ROCCO
What more do you want?
The food here is fabulous, and it's served in an open setting right across the from Washington Market Park
The service is excellent, and the portions are quite large
The food was actually aweful
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it
It was disgusting
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
We ate here on Valentine's Day, and it was a huge mistake
We were seated in the rear garden, which was enclosed and heated for the winter, but because of a draft (and the fact that it was 18 degrees outside) we froze for most of the evening
Our waiter took our order at 8:45
We did not see him again until 10 pm, when he asked us if we wanted our desert
SINCE WE HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN OUR DINNERS YET, we were a little surprised
People were complaining and walking out
The food was so-so, but the service was so bad it was appalling

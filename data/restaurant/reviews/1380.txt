i've told every single person i know never to go here, i hope it goes out of business
or maybe they should move to midtown so all the bridge and tunnel people that were there can feel right at home
It's too dramatic
It is upscale place, unbelievable design
The food is ok, Phili Morimoto much much better
The drink is great, but I couldn't say great to the food
It's overprice, of course
Who will say Patek Philips watch not overprice ?
Because he is famous so he has right to pricy himself
Overall ??? still couldn't catch new yorker
When you pay more than $100 for dinner on a weekday and to have other dinner guests arrive in shorts and Teva sandals, you know that this place is not as posh as it wants to be
The omakase lacked originality
The first course was a variant of Nobu's famous tuna tartare, complete with plum as garnish
By the time we had broiled lobster smothered in dry curry, we knew that Morimoto had probably run out of Japanese fusion culinary ideas
The omakase must be the most popular order and there has to be a factory line just churning them out
I had specifically requested no eel in any dish, only to have sushi sent up with unagi right there
It seemed that unagi featured as a standard item in the omakase sushi
Alas, I did not feel that the service was tailored to my food preferences
I got the tasting menu - 8 to 9 courses
A lot of food, and a great experience
Morimoto even came by to check on each table
I even shook his hand
A very friendly man
YOU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU LOVE JAPANESE FOOD
This is a sensational restaurant
The decor is amazing and the menu is fantastic as is the food as well as the great service
I enjoy the variety of the food and the helpful attitude of the staff
Went there on Friday night and 4 of us got a table right away (in Siberia however)
I was expecting a good scene and what we got was B and T hell only 3 monthes after opening
The space feels like an airport lounge, very cold
The food was just completely mediocre
I had the calamari tempura salad which was greasy, the Kobe beef carpacio v good
We shared some rolls which were just ok
The duck entree was another serving of grease with a runny duck egg, I passed
My friends had the black cod and lobster entrees both of which were fine
Had no problem getting at 9:00 Saturday night reservation when i called the day before
Sat at the Omikase bar with my sister and got a kick out of seeing Morimoto making rolls right in front of us
Saw them making softshell crab rolls which looked soooooooooooooooooooo goooooooood!!!! The drinks were good (White Lily ~$12, Hydrangea ~$12)
We both had the Omakase which was ok
We had tuna tartar (very good), seared salmon(very good), Sashimi assortment ( good), HUGE oysters with frois gras (we hated it but we just dont really like oysters in general), spiced lobster (good), king crab ( REALLLLLLLLLLY GOOD), Kobe beef with eggplant ( very good) Pistachio cake? dessert (loved it)
The decor is nice but lacked atmosphere
Server was fun and talkative
And yes, the bathroom is pretty cool but could use a little cleaning
Overall Good just to try
I probably won't be back soon only because its $$$$
i've been to his philly restaurant twice and i thought that was great, but this one was even better
i met him in philly and he was there again last time
i had the omakase and it was the best i've ever had
what an experience
perfect timing in between plates
wonderful and attentive service, and presentation was beautiful
the foie gras mushi is a must!!!! it was expensive but worth every penny
i'm sure to go back
and oh yes, you have to check out that high tech bathroom
At first sight, the restaurant is impressive with its curtained entrance gleaming white interior
Definitely a huge space was aptly filled
My date and I opted for the omakase menu and were satisfied but not blown away
The range of dishes presented were good: several cold apps
(including delicious oysters a do-it-yourself toro tartare) a few hot apps
Main courses (roasted lobster w/ garam masala and grilled crispy red snapper) were tasty while dessert was average (pistachio almond cake w/ too-tart strawberry sorbet rhubarb compote)
Overall, the flavors balance of the dishes were excellent and not overwhelming
It was a good menu to try for a special occassion
Service was friendly and helpful
On our next visit, we'll stick to a la carte
Till then, we'll definitely be stopping in for martinis downstairs
fyi: The infinity mirrors in the restrooms are worth a visit

Pros: Occasional Oohs or Aahs will likely arise when you see a plate artistically presented or when a taste surprises--likely the lovely foie gras chawun mushi
The space is either cool or cold depending on your standards
Cons: The prices are largely ridiculous
The sake menu has ~3 bottles under $100 and most over $250
How many Americans know that much about sake to justify this? Many dishes on the over-reaching menu fall flat taste-, temperature-wise
Some things served tepid--the wagyu with tepid/cold, watery bok choy? Sushi is nothing special
Some seating feels like banishment
Service professional but disorganized
Moritmoto was there the night we dined but was either busy with the chef's omakase table or, when we left, was having an agitated conversation with someone on the phone
So what
I made a reservation a month in advance for my boyfriend's bday and wanted to try this place ato see what the hype is all about
The ambience of the place was a definate plus the bar the bathroom was beautifully design
My boyfriend ordered the Omakase which was an 8 course meal
He was not full at all
IT may be 8 courses but each course was as small as my thumb
THe Rock shrimp tempura however was excellent! Cocktails there were really good
Everything was very pricey but I guess its because of the Name
We saw Morimoto and did take a picture with him
I did have a good time there, but I don't think I will be making a regular trip there since it did burn a hole in my wallet
Despite reading some negative reviews of this new restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a go
We were seated promptly and although we didn't sit close to where the culinary action was taking place, our seats were higher up and had full view of Morimoto and his crew working away in the kitchen
I really like the interior (don't understand why some thought they looked cheap), loved the beautiful ceiling, sexy and smooth lines of furnitures and ambience

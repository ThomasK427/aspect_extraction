there is always chaos when you walk in the front door
the service needs a little work as well
Tao is a fun place to go if you don't mind waiting forever for a table even if you have a reservation and if you don't mind the crowded, crazy, atmosphere
I really like the food here and the special drinks are wonderful! The appetizers are all fabulous and the wasabi crusted filet mignon is too
Don't forget to have the chocolate cake, but it takes patience to deal with some of the attitude and if waiting doesn't bother you, it is a fun and tasty place to eat!
Admittedly, the space is very well done - giant Buddha, great decor and high ceilings to boot
But there is just not enough space in this place for all of the people they let in
A friend and I went here for drinks appetizers around 8:30 on a Thurs
night and we could barely sip our drinks w/o someone knocking into us
We couldn't order appetizers b/c there was nowhere to put the food! Plus, the BT males that flock to this place w/ their possees of losers tends to overwhelm a person
Definately won't return to eat on account of the crowds which is a shame since I've been told the food is quite good
Just not worth the struggle when there's so many other great places in the city w/ great Pan Asian and enough room for a relaxed, comfortable dinner (Asia de Cuba, TanDa, etc
)
I have heard bad things about Tao, but when it comes down to it, the food was FABULOUS and delicious, the drinks worth the 10+ they charge you, the service great and the atmosphere inviting
We only waited 15 minutes past our reservation and the place was packed
The wasabi crusted fillet mignon was by far the best I have ever had! I defintely recommend this place to everyone who can afford a pricey evening on the town
i have heard mixed reviews about tao, but bottom line is i would go back again
true I had to wait longer for my table, but the ambience and the food definitely made up for it
the KOLBY BEEF WAS amazing
and the server was very helpful in deciding our dishes
this place has virtually nothing for vegetarians
Overall I had a good experience here
I had to wait 30 minutes despite my reservation
We were seated in the most cramped spot downstairs and it was hard to enjoy w/people so close to you, you felt they were in your party
The food was excellent, the service wasn't
Our servicer had no personality and wasn't attentive, rushed us
We saw a few celebs there, good people watching place
All and all it was good!
This place was great, great atmosphere, great food, and great people
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
We went there for dinner last night and were amazed
What an awesome space! The food was great, especially the Chilean Sea Bass
We had a very friendly waiter who helped us choose from the vast menu
We just booked our holiday party in the cool room upstairs and cannot wait!
If they spent half as much energy on service as they did on decor, they would have it made
I dont know what was worse the wait or the pager they gave me despite my reservation
The lounge is chuck full of bridge and tunnel FREAKS
Single handedly the most unenjoyable experience I have ever had
I could not believe how discourteous the staff was
The food was horrif, they put the dump in dumplings
Like Hotel California, you can check out anytime, but you cant wait to leave
After waiting an hour for our table, I was faced with mediocre asian (mostly chinese) food
The food was far from creative and the service was a disaster
Trying to live up to Buddha Bar, this is definitely a miss
Sometimes trying too hard just doesn't work
I went this past sat with reservations and it still took over an hour, but it was absolutely worth the wait The food is Amazing!! This was my second time there, it keeps getting better
I cannot wait to go back
I recommend this place to everyone!! Definitely order the Tuna Sashimi appetizer and dragon roll, the single pieces of eel melt in your mouth
Make this the next spot where you dine, the atmosphere is great!
because you aren't actually reserving a table, but a spot on a what must be a very important list
I am sure the food would have been great, but unfortunately, after waiting over an hour and a half and then being told that there were still two parties of 6 in front of us, we decided that there was no way the food or the atmosphere was worth that wait
Of course, places like this are pretentious enough to think that it doesnt matter how they treat their potential paying customers, because there are plenty of others waiting right behind them
That may be true, but if you are looking for a great meal and fun atmosphere, there are plenty of other restaurants that know the meaning of a reservation
Try one of those first
Yes, this is definitely a very hot place, lots of beautiful people and gotta try the giant fortune cookie for desert!! Make sure you dress up and look good!!
A definite supreme experience for atmosphere, scene-seeking, and tongue tantilizing flavors! The koobee beef is a definite must if you're a beef lover! Hats off to those who work so hard to massage the cows in Koobee so we can indulge! Its a place to go to if you want to have a fantastic time, spend a lot of money and not expect so much from the service
and don't mind the blood pumping bass from the music and the wait
Well, it's
big
That's the nicest thing I can say, and that's not really a compliment
From the moment I walked in the door it was a loud, crowded, uninspired, full-frontal-assult of attitude
The host was playing god with his headset and reservation list, the bar was packed with horney drunken investment bankers, reservations are a joke and after haplessly sliding the plates at us when serving the food, they couldn't wait to collect the plates until we were done
Luckily, the food wasn't worth fighting for
I made reservations one week in advance and although I had to change it at the last minute, the hostess was very accommodating and we got seated promptly upstairs overlooking the Buddha
Although the server was very pushy, I liked that he did not always suggest the most expensive thing on the menu
We ordered 6 appetizers and 3 main courses
Everything was good and presented nicely
My favorite was the filet mignon cooked atop a hot stone
It was tender and perfect
My only complain is the quality of the waiters
They felt it was beneath them to walk around and collect dishes from all sides and a few times pushed our utensils off plates we were obviously still working on
I suspect their goal was to get us in and out as quick as possible
Thats NY for ya!
Very trendy, very loud, very crowded, very good! Super fusion of Asian cuisines
Extensive wine and drinks menu
So much to try and service willing to provide it all
Busy, busy, busy bar scene
and you'll need to wait even with a reservation, but definitely worth it
The ambience of Tao transports you to a zen state, candles, koi pond, big Buddha
The Asian fusion food was fantastic
The prix fixe lunch is a great deal
This place was awesome
We made reservations and were seated right away
The selection of food is familiar yet eclectic
The drink menu is different than any where i've seen
The food was excellect, especially the steak
Make sure to save room for dessert
Top Quality
Tao is the place for beautiful people who like to get away from the drunkin slobs at local pubs
Dress up and look good or expect attitude at the door
Once seated the service is great, the food comes very fast and is above average, and is not overly over priced
The drinks are great and the high celings open the room as wide as your eyes
Tao is a great place to start the evening with a light meal surrounded by five or six of you closest friends
Make sure to make reservations
I live right around the corner from Tao -- have been there quite a few time
I like the food and the setting is ok (although it's a total rip off of Buddha Bar!)
The greatest problem is the wait -- we're talking at least half hour with reservations! The Maitre D' does not seem to understand the concept of reservations -- why would I make reservations if you are going to have me wait forever, until I don't even want to here there anymore?! I think I have to say goodbye to Tao -- try Serafina's next door instead (they have a wonderful chef and great pasta!)
Went to Tao it was incredible
The London chick who gave her review was pitiful! Calling people Euro wanna be's is tacky
It's NYC sister, there are tons of Europeans there! It wasThursday night, had reservations

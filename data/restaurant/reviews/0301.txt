Don't go here
Ever
The food is amazing
You must try the food
I went out with a few friends and each dish was to die for
You must go there!!!
The food, the ambiance, the drinks and the staff were all great
The prices were very reasonable
We weren't kept waiting long even though it was a Saturday night
Unfortunately, they don't accept credit cards so make sure to bring cash
Next time I want to try the back garden, it looked lovely
Definitely worth a second visit
This is a great place
Went here with my brother and his friends for dinner one night
Very welcoming staff and the food was wonderful
The chef Aron sanchez gretted our party at the door and was very nice
The mojito in town
FABULOUS service food! All 21 of us celebrated a birthday tonight without a single problem
Summer, our waitress was courteous and on top of everything - coming back frequently to take more sporadic orders for drinks
Damon helped with choosing the menu served family style and the food was awesome
Service and food doesn't get any better than this! I was nervous that some of our big eaters wouldn't get full, but we were ALL happily stuffed! Thanks to the staff at Paladar, we had a grand time!
pleasant all-weather patio, great drinks, good food and reasonable prices -- and none of the snoot and tired model wannabes that seem to grace so many of its neighbors
keep up the good work
Excellent mojitos, and we simply love the spacious and brightly decorated back patio
Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) meal out of theml
The spicy mussels are a highlight
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio
The Scene Soothing lighting and casual decor combine to create a calm, low-key atmosphere, with a full bar and outdoor seating
The Food This is the kind of sophisticated Mexican cuisine that should have made inroads in New York long ago
You won't even miss the free all-you-can-eat chips, since there's no point in squandering your appetite on such trifles when you can savor sprightly, tangy seviche instead
Among the entrees, choose the duck with mole; it manages to be as voluptuous as a hot-fudge sundae, without tasting the tiniest bit sweet
The catfish tamal disappoints, however
For dessert, try the chocolate torte or better yet, the praline cheesecake
This is way above your aveage burrito place but isn't insanely expensive
It has creative Mexican food without seeming totally divorced from standard Mexican cuisine
We were seated promptly, the decor and atmosphere were appropriate without being forced , and our server really was great- friendly and helpful in a real way
Plus, they have a million flavors of genuinely fresh margaritas (real fruit pieces!)
Also, they're open late-ish
Portions aren't huge but by no means shabby
I've been to La Palapa a couple and each time I have mixed feelings about my dining experience
I suggest going during the week day at a time when it's less crowded
We went on a Saturday night and it was very packed, so I understood mind the 30 minute wait
We had excellent food (love the spicy yellow blue corn chips) and okay service
We figured next time we'll make reservations and head over at an earlier time another weekend
Well, we did just that and still waited for 20 minutes with reservations (!!!) and you can see lots of empty(party of two) tables around
Very odd
I HIGHLY recommend the frozen strawberry margaritas!!! Muy excellente!
A friend and I walked into La Palapa off the street
The ambience and smell of food enticed in the doors
However, the experience quickly went downhill
First, our silverware was dirty, and our waiter scoffed at replacing it
Second, our table was wobbly
Our server, after two askings, fixed the table temporarily and finally gave us a menu after ten minutes
However, the table quickly wobbled again and spilled coffee all over us
We asked to be moved, which subsided the problems for a little while
Finally, the largest, inexcusable mistake occured with the check
We asked one server for change, and she gave our check with a credit card to our waiter
Who then brought us another check and forgot to give the credit back
In the end, we had to confront him about the missing credit card
all in all
a disaster!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I have been here several times, and enjoyed every vegetarian-friendly item on the menu
The waitstaff is prompt and courteous, the food is phenomenal, and the prices are reasonable
Try my personal favorite dessert, the tres leches cake
This is a great place to take out-of-towners
Perfect margaritas made with real lime juice, not a pre-mix concoction of sweet and sour mix
I'm surprised that one reviewer would actually complain about a soft taco costing $4
95
Um, you are at a restaurant
Not Taco Bell
And, is that really breaking the bank? I don't think so
Service has always been pleasant and helpful
We always sit as soon as our entire party gets there
I went w/a Mexicana from Chicago
It didn't start off on a good note because there was no complimentary chips and salsa - a bad sign! And I ain't payin' $5 for that, ya dig? We had a decent appetizer, but I spent $20 on this combo plate that just didn't move me
My date had a soft taco, which cost $4
95(!) If that was not bad enough, a side of sour cream was $2! In total, bill with drinks and dessert was $69
I've never felt so ripped off in my life
For that kind of money, I could have gone to a nice steakhouse and been treated like a king (and queen)
This city still leaves me cold for Mexican - why can't NYC get it right? Why aren't there any good hippie food burrito places around? A big deep six from me!
Once you go inside this restaurant, yuo are automaticly welcomed
The service is very warm and attentive
They will always offer you a smile
In addition the food is delicious
I have gone to many other restaurants but none as perfect as this one
There is one reason alone to visit this restaurant: The Hibiscus Margarita
It's so good it DESERVES to be capitalized
On the plane ride home, I was tapping my veins for the sweet nectar of the gods, for which I knew I'd have to wait years before I had it again
God, the corn is tasty as well
I live in North Carolina; it's been too long since my last moments at La Palapa
All I have for consolation is a postcard I shamelessly took with me to post on my refrigerator in memories of my H
M
and suitcases I had to lug in with me on my way to the airport
(tears
)
Stopped in on a Saturday at around 4
Pretty empty, but hey, that's late for brunch
Hostess waved myself and girlfriend to sit wherever we liked
Menus and water right away; no bread, chips, etc, but a trio of salsas set down with water
GF had Mexican rendition of french toast, which was huge, quite crisp on the outside, verging on melted on the inside, w/ cinnamon syrup and sliced banana

I will never go here again
Review for NYC location
We arrived with a group of 15 and was seated promptly
The variety of sushi and cooked food was impressive
Food was tasty and fresh
We had friendly and attentive service
We didn't feel rushed and was glad there were no rules to the all-u-can-eat some other Japanese restaurants have
This is a great place for kids and groups because the restaurant is huge
For the price you pay this is definitely a great all-u-can-eat deal especially in NYC
This review is for the NYC Location
I went there last night with 3 friends and my wife
1
BAD SERVICE, the host was not very accommodating at all, and when we asked for another table, we were refused and the place was empty, we were there only for 1
5 hours when the waitress gave us the bill, and we didn't even ask for it
2
even WORST FOOD, the SUSHI WAS NOT FRESH, and the SASHIMI was basically SCRAPS lefted over from making the sushi, they didn't even bother prettying up, just thrown on the traps
the COOKED STUFF were OVERCOOKED, the lobster tail was DRY, and CRAB melted in your mouth like mashed potatoes, the salads and dessert looked like they were lunchtime leftovers
I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the wide variety of dishes
I loved the soba bar and the huge sushi bar
The service was very good
Simply put, the food was awesome
There was a wide variety so there is something for everyone
I didn't expect such high quality and delicious food from a buffet, but the food was unbelieveable
fresh and gourmet and prepared in front of you
and I highly recommend the lobster
Try this place
you will not be disappointed
Great sushi
fresh
and large pieces
First let me tell you I wish the food was bad so I would never return
unfortunately the food is AWESOME
From giving our table away, to the wrong wine bottle on the table, to getting other peoples checks! I am NOT kidding and I eat there often
Go in, take a deep breath and expect great food, fairly priced with just about the worst service in North Jersey! We are getting DAruma takeout tonight :)
The food, the service, the ambiance and the prices were absolutely perfect at this restaurant located in a quiet neighborhood
This place is very good for any occasion
Not as romantic as Cafe Matisse across the street but it's a great place for a well priced steak
Simliar to a NYC steakhouse the meats are great and we enjoyed the sides as well
This place can be romantic and is not a good place for children
BYOB everywhere in Rutherford is helpful on the pockets
Our bill here for an appitizer, 2 steaks with 2 sides was under $100
From the chef who brought Village Gourmet to you comes this sophisticated yet unpretentious steak house
Great food, done to perfection and as desired
Freindly staff, cozy, great date night attraction
This place has the most delicious made-to-order kimbab (korean sushi, for the ignorant ones out there) and spicy rice cake dish (dduk bokki), as well as noodles, of course
It's no-fuss, fast and delicious
Definitely recommend it
I love Italian food and I was very happy at Vago
I came here for lunch
The prices were very reasonable for a nice restaurant in this area
The decor and atmosphere could not compare to the city's top tier of restaurants, but it was very nice nonetheless
The service was excellent
Not only was the waiter efficient and courteous, but also extremely helpful
For instance, he suggested a sauce not on the menu that I could substitute for the regular sauce
The food was very good as well
The lobster ravioli were excellent
I would not describe the experience as fine dining, but for a regular restaurant meal, this was excellent
This is certainly a very solid choice if you want to have a pleasant dining experience in midtown without having to take out a second mortgage
The spacing between the tables is perfect
We did not feel as though we were dining with strangers
The ambiance is romantic and elegant
The persona of all staff was without attitude and made the two of us feel very welcomed
Our waiter's suggestion about the wine was incredible
We were ready to order an $80 bottle of wine, however, he suggested another, at half the price, that had all the necessary qualities of a very fine vintage
everthing from food, serice and atmosphere to covenient parking was outstanding
I think the reason why the rating for this restaurant are so low is because of the ambience, which is a cross between a highschool cafeteria (huge place, cold hallogen lights) and an old diner
But the food, esp El Pollo Asopada, is some of the best I've had
Locals on a tight budget who know their food bring their families here for special events, ie, graduations and birthdays
So if great food is your priority and you don't mind sitting in a restaurant with decor a la the 1960s (I actually sort of like it-- it feels honest) this is a great place to go
OH and pitchers of beer run for $10!
This is simple the best burger I have ever tasted
Try the Eastchester wiht swiss
A++
This is one of the best Italian restuarants my husband and I have ate at
The food is fresh, the service is great
We enjoyed everything starting with the antipasti, continuing with the entrees and we even finished with the chocolate dessert
We can't wait to return
I am very sorry to disappoint all of the Big time lover of the renomed Bronx institution with a multi-plaque wall many time awarded for food, and a Big Proclamation of the Major of NY claiming the BEST Italian !
It is absolutely the opposite
He may have in the Past but not Today
We got there at 6:45pm:now; we all know that saturday night dinner out is a big NO NO and nobody will assume to have dinner in a quiet and piecefull restaurant anywhere in the five borogh
estimated wait time
the hostess wasn't sure until 3 hours later 10:28: Here we go Eggplant parmigiana fried grease an heavy duty Pollo dish covered with 1/4 of a pound of mozzarella
Italian American maybe,there is so much out there today for what we pay ! His Wine list is very Unbalanced and pricy
Roberto'sis the best Italian in NY and well worth the trip to Arthur Avenue
It's not as formal as your other top italian restaurants or as pricy, but the fod is even better
Roberto recommends that a couple should order one appetizer, one pasta, and one main course to share
If you do that it comes to about $30 pp plus drinks and you will be full
The deserts are good - you may have a more enjoyable time walking to one of the many desert places in he neigborhood (Arthur Ave Cafe is my favorite)
Back to dinner, order the specials fo the day - they are almost always Roberto's recommendations and are always excelent
Pastas are probably his specialty - the al porcini is to die for if you like mushrooms
Roberto is almost always available for suggestions
Enjoy! Remember - no reservations
I went to Roberto on Sunday just to avoid the big crowd on Saturday, I read good reviews about this place so me and my wife we decided to go to the Bronx, we were lucky to find the table right away the place was already half full for Sunday lunch, the food was good but not a big deal as some people may say, the main course I ordered came without vegetables I had to order a side order of broccoli rabe that thing really disappoint me, my wife main course at least had arugola with her grilled chicken, and I think it is ridiculos expensive, why pay so much money to eat a dish of pasta , I have been in other places where you get the same taste and larger portions for a lower price, so Roberto really did not convince me
I agree with everybody ,the place is classy , romantic , food great ,Roberto always checking that everything is fine ,well I'm from Rome and I can say that Roberto is my top 5 Italian restaurant in the world , the food is fresh and real Italian preparation and taste( a tip if you go in Italy don t expect to eat chicken parmigan o fettucine alfredo in a nn tourist Italian restaurant is an ItaloAmerican Dish)I know many people in America like to mix and taste so many different things in their dishes Kind of Emril style but Italian cousin is a perfect balance of few ingredients and Roberto is very good in that
Pricy maybe worthy absolutely, just go
For real Italian food, there is no need to look anywhere else
I doubt anyone would dare to challange Roberto's specialty pastas
Tremendous variety of dishes
Staggering tastes and smells abound

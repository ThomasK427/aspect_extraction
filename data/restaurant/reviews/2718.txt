The food at this place is great so I would definitely recommend going there for and early hour dinner
But this place comes to life at night
If you are going to venture into Salty on a Thursday - Saturday -- BEWARE
Its a great place to dance a lot, get drunk cheap and chill with your friends
If you are into guidos and thugs then you can hook up while you are there also but I wouldn't recommend that!! They play lots of hip hop and reggae but just enough house music to keep everyone happy
The bartenders are awesome and the firefighter theme of the bar goes perfect with the American Pride emotion New Yorkers have been dealing with
Overall
a great Bay Ridge Bar (but please don't visit too often or else you will hate it
I promise!)
I was there the other night with a few friends
We had so much fun
The music was great everyone there was just looking to have fun
Much better than SI bars thats for sure!
GREAT FOOD, Service was fine -Dinning space was a bit cramped, but overall it was a trendy upscale Brooklyn eatery in Bay Ridge!
I love this place and order take-away or delivery on a regular basis
It is, hands down, the best Chinese take-away place I've ever tried
Service is quick, friendly, and exact, and the food is well-prepared and delicious
Plus, this is the first (and only) place I've ever tried that used cleaned shrimp
I highly recommend Dragon China!!
From the seafood dishes to chocalate egg creams to waffles at 4AM (and any other hour), Tiffany Diner is a classic East Coast diner with dependably good food and (in my opinion) helpful and efficient service
Perfect for when the bars close at 4AM
Excellent food, service, courteous and respectful staff
Great choice of wines
Pleasant atmosphere - never felt rushed
Highly recommended!
We eat out alot but this is the place we eat the most
The fact that we live close is a blessing because we would travel far for food of this quality
This place puts many higher priced (Brooklyn Manhattan) to shame
As the person above said as well, if you don't see what you want on the menu
just ask
CHRIS CAFE IS A WONDERFULL PLACE TO GET A GREAT TRADITIONAL AMERICAN MEAL, AS WELL AS A DAILY TASTE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED GREEK SPECIALTIES
FROM THE MOMENT YOU WALK IN THE OWNER MAKES YOU FEEL AT HOME AND DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN TO ENSURE YOU VISIT IS PLEASANT
THE LIGHTHOUSES ALL AROUND YOU CAPTURE YOUR GAZE WHILE THE AROMA FROM THE KITCHEN ENHANCES YOUR TOTAL EXPIERIENCE
ENJOY IT
I've been in Brooklyn for a week now and have eaten out for every meal
My meal at Pietro's was the worst
The place was empty (my boyfriend and I were the only one's there other than the potty-mouthed patron's at the bar) yet the service was slow
Our mozzarella sticks came out lukewarm
The pasta was average and not worth the $13
95 price tag
We couldn't wait to get out
if you don't want to go deaf from that rock music on friday night, cappucino cafe is your place
they have homemade tiramisu that is the best
pecan pie is sooo good too
however, stay away from crepes and cocktails
instead, if its too hot outside, indulge yourself with coup petit deux-vanilla ice-cream with peaches and melba sause
This place has pretty good food
It's normally empty, which I don't get
It's a little out of the way as opposed to the rest of Bay Ridge
In Short The main attraction at this festive Japanese steakhouse is the cast of knife-tossing hibachi chefs who dazzle crowds at large communal tables
Private tables are available for more intimate occasions
Hibachi meats--filet mignon, shrimp, scallops, lobster and combinations of each--arrive with tangy dipping sauces and plenty of fried rice
Bountiful sushi platters, which focus on familiar basics like salmon and tuna, are best followed by green-tea ice cream for dessert
I love Arirang
I go there like once every two weeks
Their shrimp and fried rice are superb and totally the best!!!!!!!! Dont pay attention to the other reviews- all hibachi costs around there and the atmosphere is fine
The only thing you should watch out for is the chef you get
If you have one and like him alot, next time you come, ask for him
Also, if you go there for someone's birthday, they really are prepared
Its fun! Plus, we love how the menu has a picture of all the items so there are no surprises when your food comes
If you want some good food and arent afraid of a lil fun, go to Arirang
From all the advertising, I really expected the place to be superb
It didn't exacly meet my expectations
the wait for our drinks, appetizers and food was very long, the food was mediocre, and it was a bit pricey
Well considering that it was hibacci, I guess it was ok $20 for regular shrimp, chicken, or steak hibbaci
I guess I expected the food to taste better
The chef was funny and definitely very entertaining
The atmosphere was so-so, nothing special
I'm not sure if I would reccomend this place
I've been to Arirang's several times and i've always had a blast even though it's a little pricey
It's lots of fun to watch they chefs prepare your food, they put on a real show
It's well worth the money
They make the best fried rice i've ever had
and I had both the salmon and the steak and shrimp combo and both were terrific
It's great for a special occasion and you have the most fun with a large group
Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we had a great time
Not to mention the food was fantastic
The hibachi chef was hilarious
Needless to say we will be going back
Everyone was supa dupa friendly
A nice place to have a quiet dinner
Service was great and very attentive and the food was excellent
trhe wine choice was a bit limitted but overall it was a place worth exploring
if your looking for genuine italian food then this is def the place to hit! the seafood is amazing (try the salmon) and the pasta dishes will remind u of nonna's homemade cooking

What can I say - I have been to Tarantella many times and I have always been extremely happy with the food and the service
Home grown Italian food, generous portions, authentic Italian food and service at it's best
The owner is friendly, kind and VERY Italian
The entertainment is awesome - and believe it or not, I was so impressed with one of their musicians/singers (named Alessandro) that I even had him play during my cocktail hour
Can you believe that?
The waitstaff is incredibly helpful here
The fish is good quality and they often carry seasonal fish not found on the regular menu
Prices are comparable to a slightly upscale sushi place in the city
A regular sushi dinner will run you about $12, if I remember correctly
Beers are only $3

How else can I describe this fine restaurant and the outstanding service provided by George and his dedicated staff
I have been enjoying the superb food and dining here since my father-in-law Nadim introduced me to all this new cuisine
A warm friendly family atmosphere, personable service and the only place Ill eat Kibbi Nayye (Raw Kibbi) outside of Leila's, my mother-in-law! A simple dish like Fattouch or Tabbouleh are turned into the most delicious salad youll ever have
Their standards are high and proportions are generous

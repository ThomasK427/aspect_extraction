The appetizers, hot and cold, are especially delicious
Hot, flaky spinach pies and cheese pies burst with comforting buttery flavor, while stuffed grape leaves rouse the palate with brine
A host of dips--chickpea, carp roe, garlic--are complex, pleasing and filling
Entrees impress less: a sweetish, oniony lamb stew is serviceable, though not memorable, and salt-cod cakes could be more flavorful
But a meal of small plates, to go or to stay, is a definite winner
Eating at Snack would be exactly like eating at your Greek grandmother's, if your grandma were 40 years younger, hip, and a gourmet cook
I found the Citysearch review of this place particularly unhelpful, as though the reviewer had never eaten Greek food before
The sweetish, oniony lamb stew that's described as only serviceable is in reality a simply magical rendition of a classic
The avgolemono is heavenly, and the keftedes are the best I've ever had
Ever
(Sorry, Yiayia
)
tiny room, with high quality and flavor
what can i say- no matter how many times it's always simply amazing
the lamp special appetizer is divine- the beet salad so so fresh and tasty- the papoutsakia are superfine and everything i love love love- or i am so Greek- it's the ultimate Greek bistro-tavern little snack jewel in the city
finish with a coffee, the traditional one
desset like, they do it sweet so
go for it! bravo snack, you make me feel proud and so so good
EVERYTHING WAS JUST PERFECT
THE SPACE, ELEMENTS, FOOD AND PRESENTATION, SIMPLICITY AND SERVICE
THE HORTA ARE EXCEPTIONAL, THE HORIATIKI SALAD ALTHOUGH I WOULD PREFER THAT IT WAS CHOPED RIGHT AT THE MOMENT THAT WAS ORDERED MET MY STANDARDS
PAPOUTSAKIA OR LITTLE SHOES VERY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE CREAMY TOPPING (BECHAMEL)COULD HA BEEN A BIT CREAMIER
THE SAGANAKI WAS FAIR AND THE PIES JUST FINE, NOTHING SPECIAL BUT PRETTY GOOD FOR STARTERS
THE SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY FINE AND THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE PLEASANT
I LIKED THE ATHENIAN BEER WHICH I NEVER B4 HAD IN ATHENS-GREECE
GOOD GOOD-AS A GREEK DIFFICULT SAVVY CUSTOMER I AM GREATLY SATISFIED BY THIS TEENY GREEK BISTRO
I WOULD CERTAINLY RECCOMEND IT-
My friend and I were intrigued by the nightly entree special, Little Shoes, (eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin), and so we decided to eat at Snack
Although very tiny, we were able to stand while we waited and have a glass of wine at the narrow 'bar
' I absolutely loved the atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the entree special by the time we sat down
My substitute entree, Veg
Moussaka, was hearty and good, but cinnamon overpowered the other flavors
My friend had the stuffed tomato and green pepper plate, which I liked better
Try the frappe!!! Very delicious
Food is tastey as well but is a little too off the beaten path for me
The place is tiny -- 10 to 12 people at most -- but, the size creates an intimate dining atmosphere complimented by well-prepared food
We're not talking about gyros and other greasy Greek nosh
The ingredients are fresh and nicely presented
The dim candle-lit lighting and unique decor suggest romance
The service is friendly and attentive
Prices are extremely reasonable -- ~$25 a head incl
tax tip
Worth checking out, esp
after a chilly day strolling about in Soho
Snack is a perfect place to eat
The food is delicious
REALLY delicious
The menu is small and focused
The service is friendly and smart
I've been to a ton of the big restaurants here in the city, and some of them are great, but Snack is at the top of my list
I recommend this for a good date place - it really is a find
The restaurant is small so be prepared to wait if you go at a busy time
There are many places that I would not dare go to in Soho
Mainly due to the overpriced menus
This place is truly unique
Great food and good prices with friendly owners
I've only stopped by Snack for takeout, but the food is utterly fabulous and I've never met with the poor service and attitude that other reviewers are complaining of
In fact, the servers have always been very goodhumored and adept at dealing with the very limited space in this understandably overcrowded spot
The taramasalata is unbelievable and the eggplant divine--even if the service were worse, it'd be worth it for the food
The Scene An outing to this ski lodge-sized hot spot, with one of the city's most expansive and popular outdoor patios, feels more like a night spent at a fashion show than dinner at a restaurant--and not just because of the celebrity sightings
There's a loose anything-goes element to the style: A 30-foot tree plucked from tropical climes sits in the middle of the dining room, amethyst geodes rest behind glass near the bathrooms and the maitre d' likes to sport red-laced sneakers with his suit
The Food Surprisingly, the food takes a more conservative tack
The kitchen steers a tight course between risk and reward, scoring a lot of obvious successes--tagliatelle with pancetta and English peas, suckling pig with tomatoes and orzo, chicken and andouille sausage gumbo
Desserts include a warm apple crisp and can't-miss banana beignets
I have only visited the Park for brunh - which is usually very good
The main reason I go is for the great outdoor seating
The patio is lovely on a Saturday morning in the summer
I also love the fresh banana bread they serve before your meal
The service is usually good
Friends of mine were in NY this past weekend and wanted to go someplace exciting and unlike any other they had seen while visiting the Big Apple
The Park was the first place that came to mind
The first time I was there was about 4 years ago when the place was packed with celebrities, models and scenesters
Although the clientele has changed slightly, the restuarant is still magnificent
My friends were impressed with the bamboo that grew out of the dining room floor, the large outdoor space and the half dressed girls hanging out in the upstairs hot tub
Th Park is unlike any other I know of in the city that I call home
When dining there you are not forced to sit so close to another couple that you can hear every word of their boring banter or have to put your butt in their face every time you get up to use the restroom
The food is average but our server was friendly and attentive which more than made up for it
My friends had a great time and plan to go back next time they are in town
As for me, I will always recommend The Park
WA surpsing find for a relaxed light lunch/brunch for someone unfamiliar with the neighborhood
All those terrible reviews about the nighttime/upstairs/clu scene had nothing to do with our experience on a Saturday at noon
The food is nothing special
but the patio is terrific if the weather is right
One of the best outdoor spaces in town
If only the seats were more comfortable
Wiill go back to see it at dusk when the lgiths come on
one of my favorite places in the city! Fun, friendly fantastic
Once upon a time, Park was a good place to frequent
The music was good, the crowd was lively, and the staff was professional
These days, it's the same space, only it is occupied with rude door staff (the woman in particular who is on her phone the entire time trying to set up her own plans to leave early), overly priced drinks and people who can't find anywhere better to go
With so many places in New York City, I suggest that you pass on this one for your own sake
The staff think they're doing you a favor by letting you be there and are consistently rude to you from the people working at the door (especially the woman) to the waiters to the bartenders and up through the management
They talk down to you like you don't deserve to be at their bar/restaurant
God help you if you complain about the service, they try to throw you out
Some friends got food there, said it was almost as good as fast food
We had a party there and a lot of my friends weren't able to get in due to their ridiculously strict dress code
The girl and the bouncer at the door made horribly RUDE comments like, Your mama shouldn't be dressing you, or you're not dressed appropriately to some of my guests who were professionals
I had a large group (about 50) and they wouldn't let us go upstairs without getting 3 bottle service at $250 each, and it doesn't even guarantee that all of my friends could go upstairs
When some girls were hand picked to go, it was empty and the music sucked
I would NEVER go back again and would NOT recommend the place

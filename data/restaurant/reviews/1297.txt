I love swanky's
long live the Swankmiester
,,,,,lol
This restaurant was the worst! Not only was the margarita one of the worst I've ever had, but it was also $10 and served to me in a plastic cup! The bartenders were some of the worst I have also ever seen
The food was okay, but overall, not worth the price and the service was below average
I left incredibly dissatisfied and never plan on returning!
This restaurant was awful! The $10 margarita was poured out of some big jug, into a plastic cup, and tasted like syrup
Gross
The fajita (twice the price of a normal restaurant) was terrible, chicken tasted processed, came with no lettuce or tomato (that was an extra $3)
The bartenders were some of the worst I have ever encountered - spent 20 minutes counting their tips as I waited to close out my tab
Lastly, after asking to use the City Search 20% off coupon, the waitress told us that it does not apply to outdoor seating
That is not indicated on the coupon, and frankly, I think this inadequate waitress was lying! I will never return!
In a world of nuevo wacky micro cuisine
and silly trends
its nice to see that Swanky's has not become that
this place was fun from the get go
he still has his silly fake pics of him with celebrities all over the place
and who else but swanky whold hang 3 five foot peppers over the bar
but with taht all sadi the reason i have been coming to swanky's for over ten years still holds true
great margaritas great food and great service
I love this place
whenever i go for mexican i go to swankys
my girlfriend lives on the east side
and i always drag her to the west side for swankys
long live El Senor
mexican moves up
this place is really swanky
this place is beautiful and really swanky they have a private party lounge which is beautiful
dinner was wonderful
and the drinks were huge and strong
and the margaritas were flavorful
this place will be a sure place that i will frequent again real soon and often
A freind of mine had there engagement party in the lounge area of this swanky place
and it was beautiful
the room was stunning,
,,,I am hoping to have an event there myself
we had a ,what seemed to be a never ending buffet of food
,
and in most resaturants they give you lots of lousy food
but this food was delicious and fresh as can be,,,,,and mountains of it
plus they were giving us drinks like they had an inside tip on a drought
lol, after the party in the swanky longe we went to the bar for more drinks
just what we needed
,
lol
but we continued to have a great time
The bar was fun and service was good
i cant say a bad thing about this place cant wait to go back
and have a party in the lounge
I eat out a lot, and I don't mind spending money, but Senor Swanky's was a loser in many regards
It cries out with cost and inventory problems
I ordered a diet coke for 2
75, which came in a small glass engulfed in large ice cubes
As I asked for a refill, the waitress stated, No free refills! If the glass was 16 ounces, with that amount of ice, there were less than 8 ounces of soda
Nothing about this restaurant fits together right
The service and price of some items, contradicted elementary concepts of supply and demand; a small glass of soda should not cost 2
75
This restaurant compared poorly against below average restaurants like TGI Fridays and Mcdonalds
i couldn't wait to write this review
it was the weds before thanksgiving,,,the upper west side was madness we were going to see the ballons
so as we got out of the train on 86th street and cpw we walked down columbus towards that ballons
and decided to help our attitude witha drink before taking on the throngs of balloon watchers, we saw this really nice place and decided a margarita was the way to go
the place was full of people and excitement
the salsa music was good but the salsa and the margaritas were even better
we satyed for a few drinks and left
went to see the balloons and on our way home they were still open at 12:30
full menu ,by the way they were the only place open
what luck
we thought even if its ok beggers cant eb choosers
boy were we wrong the food was great ,,,,i will defiantely go back
me and my date went with our 2 children
it was a saturday,still early at 6pm,so it was empty
we had 4 different meals,which were absolutely delicious
the margaritas--out of this world
they certainly didn't water them down like other places
we stayed awhile and the kids didn't upset any of the staff,which is always good
place is small but worthwhile
everything else makes up for it
i'd go back in a heartbeat,even just for a margarita
We were walking up Columbus Avenue and came across Swanky's
It looked nice enough from the outside so we thought we'd give it a try
We ordered two different types of maragaritas while munching on some very tasty chips salsa
The drinks came quickly and were absolutely delicious
We stayed around for a couple of rounds and had some appetizers
There was a nice cool, relaxed vibe here which would make me want to come back again
I was on the upper west side the other day,,,,and was walking along and i saw this really cool looking place
called Senor Swanky's I looked in and saw one of the biggest TV screens ever,,,wow
so i was sat at the bar and had ordered a margarita
the bartender crystal recommended a black cherry margarita
nice
like gino's italian ice, except witha kick,,,two and i was feeling groovy
I also ordered food i had the enchilladas Mole,,,,,very nice,,,,,it would have been great except the bartender wasn't a Jets fan
but I'll be back
i feel a convert in her is possible
lol
When Senor Swanky's closed a while ago i thought that was a fun place but so it goes
then i was told that they moved up the block and boy did they mopve up the block
this place is really really nice
its clean its vibrant its happening
and its a whole bunch of fun

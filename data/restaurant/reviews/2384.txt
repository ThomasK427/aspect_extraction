This has been one of the worst experiences i have had
The service was terrible and food not great
do not try
My husband and I enjoy Montebello restaurant very much
Everytime we get a chance we go there! The food is excellent and the waitstaff is great too!
I just recently had a business lunch at Montebello and it was a great experience
They were able to accomodate us with a private room and it was really very pleasent
The waitstaff was friendly and polite and the food was absolute perfection
The best i've ever had! I highly reccomend it to anyone who needs a private meeting or party
I recently had a business meeting at Montebello and i can't tell you of a place more suitable for such an event
Everything was perfect from the food, wine and to the service
Great place for parties!
My wife and I eat at Montebello's the first night of our weekend in the city
We arrived Friday evening and made it to the restaurant around 9 PM
The food and service were both great
We had a buffalo mozzarella and tomato appetizer and the eggplant parmesan
The mozzarella cheese was delicious the way it had tasted on our trip to Italy
My wife both enjoyed our main courses and a bottle of wine and the service was excellent
The prices were pretty reasonable too
We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed
The food is great and service attentive
Would recommend it anytime we are in the area
What a relaxing and enjoyable place
The food is just so good, the waiters are so attentive and the atmosphere is simple and relaxing
They also have a great wine list
I cant wait to go back
All I can say it that it is amazing
You are missing out if you don't go!
Montebello Ristorante Italiano is one of the most sophisticated and inviting restaurants in New York, and has been a standout on the culinary landscape of the city for the past 15 years
Glowing sconces, soft coral walls and vintage bottles of wine create an atmosphere of elegance that is perfect for both whispering sweet nothings to a loved one or discussing business during a power lunch
The menu features such sumptuous fare as lobster ravioli in a light aurora sauce, double-cut grilled veal chop with an aromatic salsa verde, and octopus salad with steamed potato, red onions, and caper berries
Montebellos homemade ricotta and mascarpone cheesecake or the ultimate Italian pick me upa Tiramisu that is the best in New York City
Montebello also offers an wonderfully priced three-course prix fixe lunch at $20
12 and prix fixe dinner at $32, that offers an exceptionally wide array of choices
This restaurant provides delicious food, great service and a sophisticated atmosphere
My calamari was well prepared (not rubbery at all), the seafgood pasta was great and the blood orange sorbet was the perfect end note to a great meal
My sweatheart and I went to Billy's last summer
It was the best meal I ever had
I could eat Billy's every night
They just don't make food like this where I am from in TN
I wish I could order it to my office
In Short In a lustrous orange room, given a rustic feel by wooden carvings and artistic touches, Our Place serves an array of Shanghai dishes alongside more common offerings
Specialties include striped bass sauteed in shaoxing wine, jellyfish salad, lion's-head meatballs, soup dumplings, and more
More familiar New York Chinese dishes are available as well
Great food, excellent service, best chinese food! Have been a happy customer over 10 years
Satisfying Chinese restaurant experience
Made reservations over a month ago for 15 people and then someone from the restaurant called me twice to confirm the reservation, once one week before and on the same day
The people were friendly on the phone and the when we arrived, the waiters were very patient and very nice
They seated us promptly and took their time with us and explained everything that was on the menu
Excellent selection on the menu and they were a decent size portion
We must have ordered about a dozen or so dishes, and not one of them did we have to complain about
Definately will return again
Thanks Our Place Shanghai Tea Garden for such a great time and great food
I'm from Shanghai
This one is the best Shanghaiese restaurant in the city!
I first went there on a business trip and loved their spicy sesame chicken! It is shredded chicken breast (all white meat!) and not at all like the weird chicken you get at some other restaurants (mystery meat)
I took my boyfriend there recently and he loved it as well
their spring rolls are quite tasty and their lo mein is also great!
Good place for a few Shanghai specialty items in midtown
After reading reviews here, I had to check out this place, and liked it a lot
I really liked the chicken appetizers, and all the dishes that I ordered
I went with friends, and so could sample a variety of dishes
I would recommend it
Food is always superb, flavorful without being overwhelming, chicken dishes are excellent and reasonably priced for Manhattan
And take-out is just as good, with meals just as hot and delicious as dining in
I was in NY on business and I went to Shanghai Tea Garden on the recommendation of this site
I was not disappointed
I was by myself and could not have been treated better
The service was fantastic
The staff and proprietor were incredibly attentive
I ordered the pan fried vegetable dumplings - a bit bland without the dipping sauce, but quite good with the sauce
I ordered the Shanghai style braised pork shoulder which was to die for
Unbelievable flavor and a huge portion
The waiter and proprietor both were giddy that I ordered it - they were incredibly proud of the dish - with good reason
The waiter indicated that it was his favorite dish
I can see why
I will definitely be back on my next trip! The only weird thing was some strange intermittent digital Chinese musical tones coming from somewhere
A small price to pay
My dad came to visit from out of town and he wanted a good chinese place
I saw the tea garden was recommended and so we went before Spamalot
Amazing all around
We went back a second time in five days!
My dad and I went here before we went to see Rent a few weeks ago
The food was excellent and the service was impeccable
The food came quickly and they served it out on plates for us and always were there to refill our water glasses
It was pretty inside too
i was pleased to hear they deliver
Highly Reccommended
I come to this place every weekend to eat
Why? Because there's nothing better
my family was shopping in the neighborhood, and we wanted chinese, so we went to this nice restaurant
when we had dinner, the food was delicous, and the service was great
this place is somewhere u won't want to forget!
Authentic chinese food,  so many tasty, affordable, delicious dim sum to choose from, make sure you go there with an empty stomach
We planned to go the restaurant next door, but find this place very interesting, with nice deco
When the food arrived, we were really surprised at the quality of food and the service
Compared with the other restaurant, this place has the quality with very reasonable price
A best value!
This place is the worst
I have no idea who are the pevious posters are, but this has to be a joke

The food tastes as good as the one that came from my grandmothers kitchen
The Tamal and Ropa Vieja -- my favorite dish here
The authentic cuban desserts reminicent of my childhood especially the vanialla custard
Too bad the waitstaff new nothing of the little island
( this restaurant is run by argentians)
The best palce to have a birthday!! Excellent cuban food, great service, and the best mojitos
My friends and I had a blast with the live music and the cigar roller
I had my best birthday party ever!!
Azucar is the real thing, from the Mojitos to the live music, 100% cuban
The food and service was excellent too, this is my new favorite place
I had my birthday there and they really made it special
Great cuban food, I really had a great time with the Live music, they really have the best Mojitos
I had my birthday party there and it really was a true cuban experience
By the way if is your birthday, the dinner is free which made even better
My lobster dinner had no lobster in it
Bad communication skills with customers
Forgot half my girlfriends order
NOT RECOMMENDED !!!!
My husband and I came here for his brithday and I have to say, we had a great time
The service was outstanding and the MOJITOS are excellent (I recommend the Coconut Mojito the best)
Our entrees were very well seasoned and prepared to perfection
We did try the traditional cuban dessert, but I would recommend passing on that unless you like bread drenched in syrup (very sweet) and covered in cinnamon
[There are many other selections on the dessert menu]
But overall this was a great experience
And just an FYI
the hand-solled cigars are worth the trip all in itself
They are VERY smooth
I am so happy to find so great place in midtown!! The mojitos are made with love here and the live music is one of the guys from Yerra Buena
This place is always packed, make sure to make a reservation is all well worth it
I have been there twice and each time the service was excellent(which I find lacking lately)
The servers always made sure our glasses were full--both water and cocktails
The timing of the entrees was perfect
The grilled calamari are tasty, so is the garlic shimp
I had the honey salmon which was just ok(dry) the first visit, but the second time I had the grilled steak which was fine--assuming you like the typical latin steak
The plantains are a great addition as are the black beans and rices with entrees
The short of it is the food is good, definitely not great
However, the festive atmosphere, excellent service and great drinks make up for it
Also, I found the bill extremely reasonable for NYC
Generally, we spend over $100 on dinner at any decent restaurant
This place is fun and it doesn't break your wallet
I will definitely go back
I had my 24th birthday and I had an excellent time, love the moitos, live music the cuban cigars, or well made by a cuban hand roller
Great place to go!!
This place is hot!!! This is what midtown needed!!! Live music, free hand-rolled cigars, best Mojitos in town!!! and very reasonable
Beautifull very friendly people, I had the Ropa Vieja and it was really good
I will come back
I've had Cuban food before and I am a fan of it
Even though this place is very nice decorated and nice ambiance, i was not impressed with the food
I didnt think it was real cuban food or tasty
I will have to say EVERYONE that works in the place is friendly and very cordial with a smile on their face
They made me stay longer for a few Mojitos which by the way are to die for
I really recommend it
The ambiance was very nice and elegant but like i said, i think they need to work a little more on the food
The staff was staff, food, and music was great
When my friend and I finished our entrees we did not want to leave, so we ordered dessert which turned out to be a great decision
This restaurant gives you the overall Cuban experience
this was only my first time there, but i would go back in a heartbeat
place is small but well worth it
drinks are typicaly priced, but delicious
they certainly don't shortchange you on the alcohol
appertizer of plantains and shrimp was a little bland, but still good
i had halibut and my date had the seafood mix, both were absolutely delicious
ambience was very nice, especially the live band that played
wait staff was very attentive, even as busy as it was
next time i'm in the city, i'm definitely going back to try another dish
The menu is creative, yet you can have the standard Thai food as well
A lot of thought went into the sauces and the food is strong enough to call attention to itself
I am very particular about restaurants in NYC and this one is outstanding
A real Gem
Ive been back which is saying a lot
You can pay more, but your won't find better
The theater district is usually crammed with your standard fare, traditional restaurants
Breeze with its Thai food offerings and cool Modern decor is a welcome break in monotony
The restaurant is small but done in a cool white and orange coloring
Menus are inventive with cd jewel case serving as menus
The food is good but, not outstanding
I had the butternut squash ravioli in a thai yellow curry sauce which was very good but other items were avg
The waitstaff was outstanding
Overall, go for a meal, not for a special occassion
what a pleasant surprise to find in the generally touristy and overpriced theater district this gem of a restaurant with yummy dishes prepared with a real sense of flavor and invention, and not the usual banal asian fare
This place is good for food before or after the theater or just drinks -- the cool and festive atmosphere adds to the fun and makes it a relaxing spot, not to be missed
the food was quite good but the portion was small compared to the price you pay for it
the atmosphere is trendy, i think it's better to come here for a drink rather than dinner
On the outside Breeze looks like a cool, trendy upscale restaurant
However, once inside the charm is lost
It is very noisy inside and the music is irritating to listen to due to a bad sound system
Unfortunately, the food along with the unhelpful service doesn't make up for the atmosphere
For the price I expected much more
Very disappointed
If you don't mind the loud techno hammering in the background (which isn't really overbearing) this is a cool restaurant to visit
The food standard I think can vary depending on what's ordered
I had the bass with watercress greens and must say it was perfect in every respect - finished every last grain of rice with the flavorful sauce
My friends chicken breast on the other hand seemed dry so I wouldn't recommend that dish (although the sauce was good)
Still, this small modern eatery with cool menus is a good pick if you're looking for somewhere near Times Square that isn't diner-like
Ask for a recommendation if you're not sure what to order
The Breeze is over-the-top
The atmosphere is sheek and hip with candles and flat screen plasmas playing great music
The wait staff is friendly and fun and the drinks are unique, stiff and VERY good!! The food was the best!! Fresh and healthy and full of flavor
We highly recommend this restaurant
what a pleasure to finally find a great place to eat in the theater district offering smart asian fusion fare, tasty but not overspicy, with a european twist

selection is great and they pile on the ingredients
try the sicilian squares and the eggplant and the spinach
The best pizza in New York period , I recomed the pesto or spinach slice , try to go after lunch to avoid line
I don't understand what all the fuss is about
This pizza is just not that good
It's true that the Sicilian is better than the regular slices, but they only offer Sicilian in plain cheese! LIP is close to where I work, so I go somewhat frequently, but I'd sooner go to Papa John's if it were nearby
This is simply the best pizza in the five boroughs with the tastiest crust
This is not your average pizza place with tables and chairs
If one desires, one may stand at the counter and enjoy the mouth watering offering but that is it
Service is fast no time for chit chat here, just keep them pizza comin'
Good stuff!
The Sicilian slices are the best I've had since I was a kid growing up in brooklyn
The regular slices are good, but not spectactular
Service is good and the people there are friendly
But the best thing for me is the Sicilian pies, which have just the right balance of sauce and cheese and seasoning, on a thick crisp crust
Beats the crust off of all the pizza places within 20 blocks, and probably further
For the person disgusted by the bare hands, latex gloves and Pizza ovens do not go well together, and I know those guys wash their hands frequently
Relax
You'll get more germs at the supermarket
This place is ok if you like small crowded places
Usually the dining area is empty at night, so it's not too bad there once you finish working your way up there through the packed cattle crowd at the bar
Food is good though
go on a weekday, weekends are too hectic!
I have been to this restaurant many times, usually for lunch
I am very impressed with their broad variety of food, their menu is extensive, and I may add that everything that I've tried is very good
Try to stop by on a quiet afternoon and you'll love it! and if you like the party scene, this restaurant turns into fun party place Friday nights
Great drinks! The strawberry margarita is really flavorful
However, very poor service
We had almost a 1/2 hr
wait for the chihuahua cheese, which was rather disappointing, basically its the innards of a bean burrito in a small dish
My friend got yelled at in the bathroom by one of the staff, and the manager didn't seem to care once she complained
The background music was good until a DJ showed up and kept playing around with the special effects on his module
The margaritas were delicious, the burritos pretty good, but the crowd OBNOXIOUS! Karaoke started at 7:00 on a Wednesday night, right in the middle of dinner
An obnoxious college crowd, who couldn't sing might I add, totally ruined my evening
In addition to the torture of sitting next to a speaker, I had drunk coeds grinding on each other a few inches from my table
Make sure you call ahead and confirm that it's not karaoke night!
Tried to order over the phone
It took forever
They said they did not have items from their dinner menu available (i
e
cheese enchiladas, a very basic item)
Then, on top of all this, they told me it would be an hour for delivery when it was already 8 pm
This place is a joke
Stay away!
I had a group party there last Saturday night
They were totally unprepared for us
even though I called in advance
First, We were told that there were out of Strawberry Margherritas
HUH at a Mex restaurant? Instead we got some Mango and Lime  margherritas
The lime tasted like salt water
Finally, we got to the food
Honestly, I eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants and this may be the worst yet
It tasted like microwave Mexican in a supermarket
Most of my friends did not eat most of their food
There is music there but the speakers upstairs keep coming in and out
Sometimes blasting
The place is good if you have large group b/c it is empty and you basically have the place for yourselves
We basically had 50 people for a private party
IF you need to unwind after a rough day at work then Viva Tequila is the place to go if you're in the Midtown area
This atmosphere at this bar is dark and cramp at first but then the music starts (by the way, the DJ plays all different types of music and takes request) and the liquor starts to flow and thens when the fun begins
The back of the bar has tables which can be moved to make more room for dancing and upstairs has additional seating for those who wish to dine away from the entertainment
By the way, the Bar Maids and waitress' will be more than happy to help you get your night started with a couple of shots of Tequila!
Viva Tequila's drinks and food were very good
We also liked it because it didn't seem like every other cookie-cutter Mexican retaurant in NYC
Two words
god awful! That statement applies to all aspects of this place
service, food and location
We went for lunch and waited 15 minutes for our order to be taken, 30 minutes for food
Neither of us ate much as the food was cold and had NO taste
The table next to us had to leave before their food came because the service was so slow
No wonder they give free drinks at lunch!
Then the owners would come in first place
This place has a great lunch offer but the service is less than stellar
Waiters and hostess were running around the place as if they were being attacked by human burritos
It took 3 times for us to recieve our beers but only once to get the check
One person received a flaming fajita that amount caused the fire extinguisher to go offer
I'd stick with the bar b/c this place the staff was moving too fast for a casual lunch place
We recently had a birthday party there and the room was nice and secluded
The staff was very patient and went above the call of duty
The food was ok
Service was extremely poor
Although you definitely aren't rushed, it would be nice to be able to order another drink
The food is extremely bland - nothing exciting to choose from
Pop in for a Guinness and introduce yourself to Joseph, the greatest bartender in New York
Went during what we thought would be happy hour, but it was non-existent - $5
50 for a pint is okay, but certainly nothing special during the 4-7 time period
The $10 nachos were decent, and 2-3 people can snack on them
Overall, an okay experience, but certainly nothing out of the ordinary
We had lunch at Bradys the other day while in the city for the day
All I can say is if lunch was this good I cant wait to have dinner there
Any place that can make grilled cheese and tomato that good has to pull out all the stops for its dinner menu
We loved the look and feel of JB's also
Just when we arrived the lunch crowd started to filter out but it looks like a great place to have a few pints of Guinness and talk with the people at the bar
What can't you say about JB's
The classic decor, the nicest bartenders, and classy pub grub all make me wonder why I would go elsewhere when I am downtown
By far the best atmosphere South of Houston St
Brady's served a great Irish breakfast to the early risers who watched the USA vs
Germany world cup match last thursday
The fact it was a very exciting game only added to the 'wall to wall' packed wall street males experience
The staff worked wonders to make sure everyone was fed and drinks were available

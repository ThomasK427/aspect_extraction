yum!! The meatball sandwich is nice
A good variety of smoked fish
Service is hit or miss, but never mean-hearted
Smorgas Chef is one of the most unique New York restaurants I have ever been to
It is incredibly charming, quaint, the service is excellent and the food is FANTASTIC
You feel as if you've been transported to Europe or Scandinavia, and can sit outside on the cobblestone street in the sun
The owners are delightful and the head chef is fantastically talented
All in all, fabulously unique and fun
MUST TRY!
I discovered Smorgas Chef totally by chance while exploring lower Manhattan after moving down here last year, and I'm so glad I did
Having lived in Stockholm for many years in my youth, I'm always excited when I find a Scandinavian restaurant, but I'm usually disappointed
Smorgas Chef was a wonderful surprise
The cuisine is fantastic, the service excellent, and the room although small, quite inviting
I highly recommend it to everyone
Smorgas Chef is a great little place on a great little cobblestone street
Consistently good food attractively served and great prices make this an excellent value
The Saturday and Sunday brunch are the best deal in lower Manhattan
I go frequently with my young daughter because she is treated like customer not an afterthought
The vanilla waffles with cloudberry jam are indescribably delicious
If you have any doubt that it is good to be alive, try these waffles!
Nice place to have around on the weekend especially for myself and my co-workers since there are very slim pickings in the downtown area on a Sunday
A little pricey, but the food is always presented nicely, well packaged and hot upon arrival so its worth the extra dollars
Thank you
This is our second time this week! As long-term downtown residents (10+years), we've been longing for a place like this
Food was amazing - we tried Swedish Meatballs and Herring Samplers - excellent blend of flavors
In the hectic world of Wall Street, Smorgas Chef manages to maintain the feel of a quaint European restaurant
The ambiance was lovely
Although the music was a little loud sometimes, we love the selection of albums
We will be back next week!
As a swedish citizen living in New York I was very much looking forward to having a nice meal at Smorgaschef that is serving Scandinavian cusine, although my entusiasm disapeared as I came to the resturant and was absolutely blown away by the bad service
To say is that it was a caos eavning as we where sitting outside and it started to rain, so we had understanding of certain difficulties, but they did not even seem to try and when the owner put a 20% tip on the bill, we questioned this and he was not understanding at al and rude
He could deffenetely have handeled this rainy dinner better
Thank you!
You will hear many mentions of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs while you eat your hueovos, muchacho!! Those are the sounds of kids from the midwest who want to be really New York!!   Anyway, the food is good, prices good, jukebox is good
I live in Bushwick so Life Cafe is basically the only bar/restaurant I can walk to that isn't totally cheesey or a front for a drug operation
Luckily, it is such a nice and friendly place that I am proud to call it my local
The atmosphere is laid back, the staff is friendly, and the prices are reasonable
My only complaint is that the specials are normally overpriced and not very tasty
Stick to the normal bar food, the burgers and fries are great
However, they tend to be overcooked so order a couple of steps rarer than you normally would
Or try their veggie burger, it's a black bean burger and it's really really good
Also, they have a super brunch menu try the Huevos Merida (guacamole + eggs = love
) Life is truly an oasis of civility in a sea of bodegas
Authentically Italian, even my Neopolitan friend thought the pizza was great
My favorite is the spicy salami one
Salads tasty and other food I've had there is also good, although other entrees may not be as much of a standout as the pizza
One caveat: watch out for pizzas loaded with too many toppings, they can get soggy
I have been to Savoia many times for ,unch and dinner
I have yet to be dissapointed
From the Pizza to gnocchi, the wine list
The homemade foccacia, everything is satisying and the prices are fantastic
Go eat
not worth the trip to smith street - that god I was head off to teki lounge afterwards
otherwise It would have been a waste of my metro card
Next time I just get deliveey from smile's on 7th
we`re two girls, we send a big huge to all staff and we raccomand the pizza maker Sasa`, he is very exellent! go to eat italian food!
I was really excited to try this place but left extremely dissapointed
If you are looking for authentic Italian food go elsewhere
Folks, this place is simply not like grandma makes
The beef carpachio lacked flavor
The lasagna was bland and had a shocking cold center
The pasta special was missing that zing that a good sauce/gravy should have
We might have sent our food back if one of the curt servers had bothered to ask how everything was
They were too focused on getting us out so they could seat the next suckers
The kicker was when the check was placed down next to me (twice by different waiters) instead of my husband
I might have been paying, this is true, but boys, where are your manners? Overpriced and flavorless
When walking down smith street pass this one by
I have been to Napoli many times and have eaten pizza at many places there
This is the absolute closest thing to Napoli pizza and it is absolutely delicious
Indeed, it is true Napoli pizza and the crust is perfect
The place is small and charming and the service is friendly and attentive
I haven't had anything else on the menu and since the pizza is so good, it may be a while until I do
This place is great
Food is yummy, prices are low, staff friendly
Highly recommend their meatballs
I love this place and go very often
I cannot say enough good things about Savoia
Excellent food especially the Eggplant Caponata, Cornish Hen, Fresh Pizzas and Polpette
Its hard to miss with the wine list either
Reasonable prices and a great atmosphere make this place hard to beat even on smith street
The service here is very laid back and gives you plenty of time to enjoy your meal in a nice atmosphere
However, if you are in a rush, go somewhere else
Foodwise I've had the gnocci and the vegetable rissotto
The gnocci is some of the best I've had, but the rissotto is just ok
I would definitely suggest getting gelati for dessert though - it's sinfully good!
My experience at Savoia was exceptional
As I entered the comfortable Carroll Gardens favorite, I instantly understood why Savoia had come so widely recommended
The warm, rustic ambience, and the friendly, attentive staff, instantly brought memories of my dining experiences while in Italy
From the traditional Sicilian appetizer Caponata, to the new-style brick oven pizza Scozzese, I could hardly bare for the last bite to arrive
The wine list included a wide variety of Northern and Southern vintages and reflected a selection chosen by a true lover of good wine
I highly reccommend Savoia for anyone interested in a authentic Italian meal among warm and inviting staff
Maybe its the fact that everyone around you is speaking Italian
Maybe its the cozy decor
Maybe its the inviting aromas pulling you off the sidewalk
Savoia definitely brings back fond memories of my recent trip to Italy
The flavors are subtle but delicious
The service is courteous, friendly, and helpful
The room is always crowded, but there is no pressure to rush through your meal
Rather, one gets the feeling that the food and drink is to be savored, and good conversation and laughter are the perfect accompaniment to your meal
The Scene This aptly named osteria is neatly tucked between brick walls on a quiet street, and given a cozy glow with red lights and other conscientious detailing

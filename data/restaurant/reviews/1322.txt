The food was average
the scallpos with the hummus was great and i wish i would have gotton that as a my meal
The chix dish i got was awful, it was dry and had no taste and the creamed spinach was nothing special
I would avoid this pace too bad its so cute cause i would have gone back but the service and the food will keep me away!
This place has fantastic lighting - not too dark, not too bright
The food is fantastic and so reasonably priced
Well, truthfully, I loved my ravioli, but my boyrfriend's risotto was made with regular rice (instead of risotto rice)
It was still yummy though
The $20 set price for bottles is the best thing ever!
Sette is a truly fabulous restaurant
Chef Amanda Freitag is helping make this place a serious challenger to Manhattan's best
In Brooklyn there are really only 4 or 5 great restaurants - Sette is definitely one of them
Orichiette with pork ragu - to die for!  And the 20 bottles of wine each priced at $20 is genius
Sette gets my vote for the best Italian in Brooklyn
In a Park Slope restaurant scene stocked with seasonal, local/organic menus, Sette is the first to challenge my allegiance to Rose Water thanks to the exceptionally friendly management, knowledgable, responsive waitstaff, good, often great food, a great list of interesting wines for $20, and lovely ambiance
Focaccia served in the latest edition of Corriere della Sera is flavorful and pairs nicely with the dense olive oil and Mediterranean olives
The grilled asparagus in Reggiano fondue with crisp pancetta is delicious and the beet salad with pear, goat cheese, watercress, and toasted pistachioes has become a part of my own repertoire
The lamb shank is, for my money, the star entree
The fish dishes are also very good
The pastas are usually strong, though a recent squash pansotti, while flavorful and delicate, was a bit too sweet
The desserts are excellent and not cloyingly sweet
I have eaten at Sette several times, and have recommended the place to others
The common view is that the food is great - when it is NOT over salted
I recently had the ox tail pasta and my tongue swelled on the way home
Last time, it was delicious and seasoned just right
Other than that, it's a great place
Listen up, chef! Easy does it with the sodium, please
I have eaten at Sette 2 or 3 times now and it is always fabulous
The asparagus appetizer, the stuffed fish, the oxtail pasta and another risotto-like dish with pumpkin and all fabulous
I love the wine by the quarto and I think it was around $9 for each quarto and the list was rather sizeable, so it was nice to try a few different wines
The service is awesome, food excellent, wine lovely what more can one ask for
Sette is the place to be
This was my second home in the summer and loved it
Worth the buck
This place really tries to please and succeeds
It's a great little neighborhood italian bistro with inventive, interesting appetizers and entrees
Try the oven roasted sardines
The grilled calamari is delish
it's really tender and not rubbery at all
The fish specials are always super
whole fish grilled perfectly, nice and moist and succulent
Once, I ordered the duck and it unexpectedly was prepared rare
I couldn't eat rare poultry
just couldn't do it and the owner graciously took it back and replaced it with another dish, the braised oxtail over pasta which was incredibly tender and satisfying kinda like the best goulash i ever had
oh, by the way,the bathroom is real nice too
I had lunch with a friend on a Tuesday and was much pleased
The food was satisfying and well prepared
The service was outstanding and most attentive
The Panini I had was light, crisp and delicious as was the $20 bottle of wine
Went for brunch on Sat
, and we didn't have to wait for a table
Our waiter was very nice, and my prix-fixe brunch, which included a basil-infused Prosecco, chilled cucumber soup, and goat-cheese stuffed Omelet, was delicious
It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't prohibitively pricey, either
The free bread they give you is amazing!!
We had made a reservation for our anniversary celebration, but still had to wait 30+ minutes for a table
When we asked the owner about the delay he was extremely rude - even saying to us this is your problem, not mine
We asked him to apologize for his behavior and he responded by refusing to serve us
We went across the street and had a great meal there
This restaurant needs to learn a thing or two about treating its customers respectfully or it won't be around for long
I keep going back to this restaurant thinking that it's inexpensive, and then paying way more than I expect to at the end of the evening
The food is not that cheap, even by 5th Ave standards, and is merely average
Maybe it's the sake--the selection is wide and smart, but costly
My son and I visited this placed and we were both thoroughly impressed
It was clean, small and initimate with a wonderful ambience (and great music), and the food was incredible
Everyone was was really friendly and helpful, particularly because I am just becoming familiar with sushi
I'll definitely dine there again
great sake selection! they also have japanese wine too
it's really pretty cafe bar served very well combination of authentic modern home japanese cooking
sushi is super fresh
i felt like I'm in tokyo
This place is the real deal
Master Sushi Chef trained in Japan, over 30 years experience this guy really knows fish
This also feature Cafe Menu that has great contemporary dishes
I recommend cucumber salad, you have never tasted anything like it and it is delicious
The interior is understated making it special enough to take a date but easy enough to stop in anytime for dinner or snack
Great backyard where you can savor the many sakes they import since this is also a sake lounge
Try one of the sake tasting combinations and you will be blown away at the variety of flavors in sake
The service is not 4 stars but staff is friendly and knowledgeable and you will really feel like youre visiting a cool spot in Tokyo
Fumiko the owner is always on hand to make sure your visit is fun and relaxing
Highly recommended
*Great Backyard *Cool Ambience *Delicious food, and sake

Last time I went there I ordedered the chefs special and I thought it was one of the best sushi that I have ever eaten  ****Over all great
Sakura Cafe is inexpensive, and has very good food
I highly recommend their sushi
Whenever I go there, their sushi is always fresh
I also love that they happy hour which is a very good deal until 7:30 PM
Their service is great and the staff is always very helpful
They also have a wonderful backyard that is very relaxing to sit in and had a gret atmosphere
I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!! ITS AMAZING
My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night at the Southside Cafe
The location was perfect as we had tickets for Mark Twain Tonight at the Martin Beck Theater, just next door
We were welcomed at the door seated immediately
The food was much better than the average Italian restaurant fare I've been served at other theater district restaurants
The grilled vegetable salad was exceptional, made fresh and beautifully presented
I also had the Shrimp ala Casa, a light and flavorful dish served over al dente pasta
As it was an off night, we were not rushed by the staff, and were able to spend time over tea and desert and still made the show with time to spare

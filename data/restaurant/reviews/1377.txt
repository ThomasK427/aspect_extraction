this place had no intention of seating us
When we complained they said, we should have made a reservation
no empathy
no status of the table
I'm happy for your success but you don't have to lie
We could have eaten somewhere else
or was the idea to force us to eat at the bar
hate scene restaurants
we overheard the the poor group next to us having the same issue
Mob scene - yes
Fully of phony pseudo-trendy types: definitely
But
its worth putting up with them (they'll move on soon
)
The place is spectacular, and the food is delicious
Amazing cocktails (can't recall the name, but try the one with tequila and cucumber)
Service was prompt, extremely knowledgeable and attentive (our server was Christine)
Food was fantastic from starters to entrees to AMAZING desserts
Can't wait to go back
i went last night sutrday  the croud was very ugly and the food wasnt that good  i have never left any nyc place so despointed like yesterday
If you like Asia de Cuba and Kitticha, and was disapponited by Tao, you will not be disappointed
The decor is beautiful, and the food is excellent - as a fusion stand point
As a relatively new restaurant, service is not too bad
At least we got to be seated right on time
If price tag is not an issue, try various of dishes, as if you are in a Chinese restaurant
If the party is big, let say more than 6 people, it will not be a bad idea to get a table instead of the long, 30-plus seat banch
Though we had 10pm reservations, we weren't seated until 10:30
The door/reservation staff is lost and confused, so the service up front is the worst I have seen
On the flipside, the food is marvelous (strongly recommend the lobster dumplings, chili rock shrimp, peking duck and chow fun noodles), as is the dining service (the waiters/waitresses are wonderful)
We had a great experience overall, but they REALLY need to fix the major issues with reception up front
Amazing! Service was good, my girlfriend and I had an 8:15 reservation for a saturday night
The restuarant is enormous, and we were sat in the 'golden library'
Atmosphere is somewhat 'loud' but more 'happening' than loud
The food was delicious and I would recomend the Peking Duck Salad, Crab fried rice, chili rock shrimp
for starters
The food is served as it is ready which is why some of you may be complaining about the timing/spacing between dishes served
Personally, I like my food fresh, so you just have to tell the waiter that you would like to order by ear
The only negative thing I can honestly say is not even about the restuarant itself, but rather the snoody, I'm better than you people that dine there
For an 8:15 reservation,on a saturday night, you can expect it to be somewhat busy
As we pulled up front when we arrived, so did about 3 other cars
In the coarse of just checking in, comments were made about what do you think about having to wait, meanwhile I'd hardly call it a wait, rather, multiple parties all arriving at the same time
not too mention hostess staff handled the situation accordingly
Later, while dining, I heard other comments made about people's dress, while I didn't notice anyone underdressed, they seemed to have
The service overall was great, although our waiter at times seemed nowhere to be found, he always popped up as we needed him
When we had orderd a bottle of champagne, we were shown the bottle, and even granted a taste of the freshly popped bottle to insure our liking, before it was served in our glasses
We went on a Sunday night on the early side (7 pm) so we were seated promptly, the noise level was tolerable and the service was exceptional at first
As the night went on and the restaurant got VERY busy, the waitress was no where to be found but at least we got our food, which was delicious
We avoided the large central room for fear of deafening noise and were seated in a side room which was perfect for us
When we were done eating we walked around the restaurant to see all the rooms and in the end we were lucky to have been seated where we were
There was no traffic (being off the beaten path), the room was dark and romantic, and the food was great
The ONLY thing I can say negatively about the night was the food was rushed
We had just finished our appetizers when the entrees were brought out
Same for dessert
Since we couldnt find our waitress until the bill came we made sure to tell her about it and she brought us a complimentary dessert (on top of the dessert we ordered!) So all was well
My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday for dinner and were directed to wait in a grand hall that was dim lit and furnished with a bar and large, dark tables with benches
It wasn't too crowded (which was nice) bc people without reservations were turned away at the door
The staff was very attentive and knew where to find us once our table was ready
The food was above average but certainly not what I would consider fine dining
To give you an idea, the dishes reminded me of items I would find in a Chinese hole-in-wall restaurant except presented with a few extra garnishes and served on prettier plates
Our waiter gets an A grade because his timing and presentation was on mark
One thing that did stand out to my boyfriend and I, besides the beautiful interior design, were the number of tourists that occupied the space- either embarassingly over-dressed or rudely under-dressed, loud, obnoxious people
I think this would be a fun place for larger parties and not so much for an intimate night for two
My dinner at Buddakan was truly a night to remember
The beauty of the restaurant is almost overwhelming, and the decor was enough to make me want to come back
Our server, Ben, was perhaps the best waiter I've ever had--he walked us through the menu to design our meal, and suggested what textures, tastes, and wines would complement each other
He took care of us the whole night, and was such a treat
The food was absolutely delicious--definitely try the edamame dumplings, beef tartare, beef filet entree, and spicy chocolate ice cream
Each flavor excites your palate and stays with you
DEFINITELY worth trying!
First off, Buddakan is enormous
Reminiscent of a hotel lobby when you check in for reservations--a half dozen cute chicks in black behind a long counter
Nice large bar area, though it cost me a small fortune for 2 drinks
Seated very promptly, despite the fact we only had 3 of our party of 4
Apps were amazing: edamame dumplings have unique texture and are delicious/crab and corn fritters comes in a generous serving and are great, much like fallafel
Entrees were good: Mongolian lamb was delicious, but not much meat/Shrimp was incredible/Black Cod (meant to rival Nobu's) was under-done and fell short
Lime Tart dessert is definitely the way to go--incredible
Our server, Jason, was extremely busy but stayed on top of his game
4 apps, 3 entrees, 3 desserts and a few glasses of wine for about $250, and that included the tip! Stunningly affordable for what's considered the hottest restaurant in the city right now
This place is hardly worth the time to even review it
The dishes were disappointing and the service was even worse
Our waiter could not explain the preparation for a single dish that we inquired about
After a few questions pertaining to certain items, and after he literally read the menu back to us each time, he explained, When I like something it's like
mmm, it's good
I'm not even concerned with what's in it
He at least identified himself as a knucklehead
I wish I were making this up, instead this ordeal ended up costing close to $250 for a less than mediocre meal for two (with 2 cocktails)
The suggested entrees were flavorless, making me wonder what all of the other choices must've tasted like
Also, pay attention that the bottle of wine ordered comes as requested
A gentlemen at the table next to us had to send the first bottle back as it came from the wrong vineyard, then again once they brought out a bottle from the wrong year
In the end, the bottle listed on their wine list was out of stock
Convenient
A total waste of time money
The host finally had our table ready 30 minutes after our reservation
This is not the spot for romance or conversation
They urge you to order all courses at once we literally had our 1st dish within 5 minutes
No joke! Its incredibly noisy rushed
The space decor is something to see
Go for a drink early on the weekday unless you are into the trendy scene of the moment
If you're going for the venue, it's great, but if you're going for authentic Chinese or Asian food, Chinatown fares better in both price and quality of food
However, if you value decor, Buddakahn is great

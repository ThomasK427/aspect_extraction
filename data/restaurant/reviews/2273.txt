the food is phenomenal - try the puffed rice appetizer - it will blow you away
the service is attentive and kind
definitely a gem in midtown
Its rare to dine at a restaurant in NY, let alone an Indian restaurant, and feel completely at home while sampling some extraordinary food
Bay Leaf did just that for my wife and I last week, as their staff was incredibly helpful and gracious
And the food was absolutely phenomenal! In fact, it was so good we went back 3 days later!! And you know what, we had the same experience! So its consistent too!!
No complaints about the food, although it was quite expensive for Indian food
But the waiters and the host at this restaurant was horrible
I thought I was imagining things when I saw our waiter being very friendly to a caucasion couple seated next to us, but people I was eating with also noticed the same thing
The food was amazing--flavors that were SO unexpected and offbeat
The staff was friendly, if a bit unattentive
The atmosphere was nothing inspiring, but I'd definitely go back for the food!
I had a take out, and it seemed to be a nice place at first
I remarked to my hubby that we should definitely try this place since its decor was so nice, although one waiter did seem overly friendly
Anyway, the food was so bad, the taste was just wrong
I am Indian, and I know when I see an ill-cooked dish
Worse, it tasted all sweet
In short, I am never going back there
Its the second worse Indian place (the worst is Bengal Express)
awesome! I just went there on Valentines with my date and we were very satisfied! From the outside it did not look that impressive but I have to admit that we are just as impressed as we stepped inside speciallly the lady in white dress and her smile
The atmosphere is great! Cosy, romantic, warm
Mostly important; the foods is yummy and not too greasy
The hosttes was friendly and not pusshy
But while leaving I had to wait 15 min
for my jacket
Will come back without a jacket
My boyfriend and I went on Valentine's Day partly because of all the great reviews here on Citysearch, but the food was expensive and not amazing, and the service was HORRIBLE
We had a really weird waiter who refused to tell us what was in a certain dish and tried to discourage us from getting it so that he could persuade us to order more expensive dishes
NOT RECOMMENDED
so i went to bay leaf last week
what can i say other than truly phenomenal !  quick points: hospitable and gracious staff
some of the best indian food i have sampled in my life
and NOT greasy at all !! (big plus in my book when it comes to indian food)
and finally
cozy cozy cozy
my girlfriend and i had a table up front
perfecto !
i feel like i found it all by myself too, as we stumbled into it by accident
an indian gem !!
Absolutely charming restaurant with attentive, friendly wait staff and delicious Indian cuisine for a reasonable price
A must do!
I am from California and my grandmother and I came to Bay leaf
She a regular costumer for atleast 8 years
The food was great
As a 15 year old kid i dont knw alot about resturants
The hostess over their treated me like her son and that felt good to me
She was very friendly and kind
I suggest everyone to try this resturant and the workers their are very nice, espeacially the HOSTESS
Went here for dinner last night with a group of people
True, we did wait a long-ish time for the food, but it was so worth it! This has to be the best Indian food I have ever had in my life (yes, I have had a lot)
The servers were extremely nice, and the prices were reasonable
Best mix of southern and northern indian in the city - and soooo delicious!!! I can't wait to go back for more Dum Aloo!
I've had the pleasure to dine at Bay Leaf on many occasions for dinner with family and friends
The service at Bay Leaf is exceptional
The staff is very pleasant and helpful in suggesting menu options
The hostess always has a beautiful smile and enjoys greeting us
What I enjoy the most is not only the flavor of the intimate setting but the personal service from the hostess who makes her rounds throughout the night
Her smile is what brings my family back again an again
She is personable to all her guest
Impeccable spicy food and service is delightful
We had heard many good things about the restaurant before going
Upon arriving, the hostess was frowning and unfriendly
The buffet selection was not that great, and the food tasted awful, ie tandoori chicken was oily, matar paneer had no paneer, and everything else was tasteless or salty
In addition the naan was cold
The only saving grace was the kulfi icecream
I would not recommend the buffet here, and there are countless other restaurants that have a better buffet for half the price
I never write reviews as I don't have the time
however after visiting this resturant for a friends birthday I had to comment
Everything was wonderful, the food, the service the abivance
Our waiter last name was Gomes, he was really wonderful and gave us a tour and showed us how the breads were made in their clay ovens
I can only say wonderful things about this place
My friends and I ended up here after walking around the neighborhood for awhile
We were so happy we did! The service was extremely friendly and helpful
Food was much better than the average Indian place in the area, and more interesting
Given the quality of the food, the price was reasonable
Everything was fresh and tasty
You really shouldn't pay this much for Indian food! There was a large menu, but my group picked three veggie dishes that were pretty bland
Also I would watch out for the Bread Basket which was basically just Naan stuffed with onions
Yuk! And the waitress/hostess was very strange and pushy
i live in new york now, but am originally from london
i feel like i have a strong sense for indian food as our indian population is double that of new york
bay leaf indian brasserie was just spectacular !!! from the quality of the ingredients, to the penetrating flavor in the food (i'm salivating just thinking about the flavor)
and i must say, the staff there was so warm, so gracious and they really make you feel like you are dining in their home
a rarity, even for new york
i am making bay leaf my personal indian dining room !!
As an Indian with discerning taste and a real appreciation for Indian food done well in a comfortable setting with knowledgeable waiters and a detail oriented and professional management, the Bay Leaf delivers
The management is always on the floor, observing the service and the customers, checking in with people to answer questions and explain the ingredients
It's a true indication that the owners really care about the food they serve and the manner in which their customers receive it
Well done, Bay Leaf!
My girlfriend and I have been going to this restaurant for years because it is one of our favorites
The food is great, the waiters are great and friendly, the owners are wonderful people, and the restaurant itself is welcoming
I recommend the Poory (spelling?) Bread with your meal
The prices are the best for the food you receive
Extremely well located, close to the theatre district, subsidised parking at $4
00, light and delicious non-greasy food,
the ultimate dining experience!!
Without a doubt the best North Indian cuisine I've had outside of India
If you're a desi you'll love this place
Combine the perfect amount of mirchi and spices, awesome dal makhani and the best paratha I've eaten in a long time with with an ice cold Kingfisher and you're in heaven
Only caveat, its not cheap

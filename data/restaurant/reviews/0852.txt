When we were done with our meal I had to wait about 10 minutes until someone would take my coat-check ticket and go bring me my jacket
Unless you are following strict kosher rules, go to a different steakhouse
Talias Steakhouse has become one of our favorite places to go to have a great evening of food, fun and laughter
The place is simply friendly and warm
The food is very good
I have been there five times and never had a poorly prepared dish
The service was impeccable and the staff was very attentive and pleasant
The atmosphere was just perfect
It truly is the right place to hangout with your date or friends
You may listen to a live Jazz, watch sport games on a large flat screen plasma T
V
or just chat with your friend in a cozy dimly lit corner with a candle on your table
Do not forget to order the delicious Thai beef salad
Just finished a fantastic with my date
The food was amazing
I had the Butcher's cut and it was very delicious
My date, who is a vegetarian had the salmon, was very impressed with the sauce and claims that it was the best salmon he had in a long time
Our server was very polite and very intuative
The atmosphere was very warm and cozy - the restaurant is dimly lit with a candel on each table
Perfect space for dating
If my date would drop me, I would definently ask my next date to take me to Talia's Steakhouse
I have had dinner at Talia's Steakhouse on several occasions and not once had a reason to complain about anything
The service is always fabolus, atmosphere is always wonderful, and the food is always wonderfully prepared
Fine dining at its best
Talia's Steakhouse staff and owner my hat off to all of you
You have the best steaks, wines and atmosphere that make you feel like you are at a party
Keep up with the good job
I eat at Talia's Steakhouse several times a month
I notice a major positive change in the service
I was told by the waiter that new equipment was purchased to speed the service and new skilled servers were hired
The food always was great
The atmosphere is very special due to the fact that the outdoor cafe is now opened and the main floor is dimly lit with candles in each table
I highly recommend Talia's Steakhouse to anyone who is looking for great fine restaurant
We found Talia's Steakhouse on Memorial Day
I had heard good things and wanted to try it
Upon entry, tables were dirty from the previous diners
Three other parties were dining yet it took 7 minutes for the staff to put together a table for four
After ordering and receiving our first coffee, we had no attention for 30 minutes
Finally I got up and asked someone to get us coffee and water
10 minutes later someone came and asked if we wanted water
We asked for coffee again, and about our food
It came one minute later
My steak was well done instead of medium
We finally received our water refill and asked for coffee AGAIN
We never got the coffee
There were about 15 employees laughing, arguing and carousing, treating the other customers (obviously friends) very well
A horrid experience
I was recently at Talia's with a large group and we received the worst service I have ever encountered in any restaurant in my entire life
They were out of 2 of the 4 steak options on the menu
At a steakhouse! It took forever to get the waiter's attention despite the restaurant being half empty
My friend had to go to the bar to get a beer
We ordered a bottle of wine, 10 minutes later I asked the waiter what happened, and he said oh, we don't have it
All the steaks were supposed to come with fries, but didn't
We complained and finally got fries after we were already done with our meals
Other parties were arguing with the manager about the service as well
This is a great, friendly and very nice steakhouse
The food is served up by a very good chef and presented very nicely not like a typical steakhouse
The wait staff is very pleasant and attentive
The ambiance is lovely, like stepping out of the noisy city
Some nights they have live jazz as well
I highly recommend the Filet Steak and the veal and lamb chops
Go with the chocolate soufle for desert
Enjoy
What a fantastic find
Beautiful restaurant in the heart of the Upper West Side
Warm, cozy atmosphere, great food presentation and value for money and Glatt Kosher to beat! There aren't many Glatt Kosher restaurants where you feel like you are in the real New York and Talia's satisfies that need
It is a small restaurant so without reservations, there can be a long wait
I went a couple times for dinner and had a great time
So I decided to take a few people for lunch
Boy, was I disappointed
Don't get the pasta with salmon
I think it's from a tin! And all of the grilled food was overdone
I would recommend dinner rather than lunch
Maybe it's the luck of the draw on what you get when you go
When they're good, they're a little better than good
When they're bad, they're really bad!
I have visited many restaurants in Hoboken
But nothing compares to this place
The first time I walked through, I knew I was in love (you know who you are)
the food, the service, and the ambiance
I will continue to visit frequently, Believe me
I brought my fianc to The Brass Rail to celebrate his birthday - it was our third visit here, and every single detail of the evening was perfect
From the friendly hostess to the lovely server who checked in on us after every course was served, everything was great
Every dish we ordered was delicious and presented beautifully
For what you get, the prices are quite reasonable, and it's a nice atmosphere
I love this place!
We took my boyfriends parents for dinner and had the pre-fix
Unbelievable price and the food was outstanding
My boyfriend had a rabbit special and we thought they would charge extra but didn't
(Some items on the pre-fix had a supplemental charge)
We ordered a bottle, and even a second, of Lemelsohn Pinot Noir which was great
If you want great food and good prices tyr this place
ANd its even worth it if you don't get the pre-fix
The Scene While the exterior blends right in with the neighborhood's clothing showrooms, the interior hides a curving bar, comfortable lounge and elegant, airy dining room
Sexy midnight-blue walls, gold-fringed burgundy drapes, gleaming chandeliers and pink feather "flowers" make up the modern, opulent decor
The Food The food consists of inventive twists on Southern cooking
While the restaurant's namesake great-grandmother probably made a mean beet salad in her day, would she have thought to garnish it with a creamy goat cheese flan? And would boldly blackened foie gras rest atop her black-eyed peas? Doubtful, but Ida Mae's traditions blend perfectly with modern culinary chic
Succulent lobster medallions layered with grilled grit cakes and dressed with crayfish butter foam; moist chanterelle-flavored chicken with light mini-dumplings; and soft, smoky short ribs with a sweet mesquite barbecue glaze excel as well
Don't Bother
They've gone out of business! Too bad, that area could use a few more good spots for dinner/pre-game

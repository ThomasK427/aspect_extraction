Six lucky diners elbow each other at the shallow, wall-mounted counter
The rest spill out into the street, or press their noses against the dessert-stocked deli case to watch the two cooks at work
Overhead, there are funky pressed-tin ceilings and colanders for lampshades
The Food Regulars swear by the tamales, which are spongy, well-seasoned and pulled from steaming crocks on the counter
They're just as fanatical about tlacoyos--homemade half-moon corncakes stuffed with smoky pulled chicken tinga--and hot-pressed sandwiches, like the Aztec Hoggie with shredded guajillo-spiced pork
Bland, meagerly portioned tostadas and chilaquiles, however, turn soggy in their to-go containers
The frothy, cinnamon-spiked Mexican hot chocolate is steamed to order, and best with pastel-colored pane dulce (sweet bread) for dunking
this hole in the wall is SO good, unlike all of the fancy and upscale mexican restaurants in the city and new england
the decor, food, ambience, friendliness, it has it all
i can' imagine anybody who wouldn't love it!
I dont know how anyone could say that Joy is as good as, or even close to as good as English Indian food
After spending the last 4 months in England, and developing the habit of having Indian at *least* once a week, I needed to satisfy my craving for some curry and nan in Brooklyn
I went to Joy hoping to find some great Indian, but unfotunately found curry that was no better than average
The paratha was an exception, very flakey and recommended, and the service was friendly, but for anyone who has had good Indian in the past (especially in England), you will probably be disappointed with the mediocre and gritty curry
I lived in London for over a decade and when I moved to Prospect Heights, I was dismayed that no good Indian restaurants existedf here until my husband and I stumbled upon this modest GEM! I love the quail appetizer, lamb madras and chicken koorma
YOIu can get a fantastic meal for two for under $30 and if you byob you can truly live it up
We bring our friends from the UK to this place whenever they come statesidfe and all agree it is as good as what we can get in Southall
This place is amazing
The decor is not the greatest in the world, but the food is phenomenal
Their tandoori dinner for two is a phenomenal deal for less than 30 bucks
My boyfriend and I have very healthy appetites and we still have leftovers for lunch
The chicken melts in your mouth, even when delivered
Some of the best indian i;ve had in new york, and definitely in brooklyn
Great food, prices, service
Nothing I've tried I havent like, but am addicted to the tikka masala, garlic naan, chana saag
Bring your own wine too (which i see as a A+)!
An Indian restaurant in Park Slope that knows that Vindaloo is supposed to be spicy! This place is a good value with good food
My husband loves vindaloo, but is vegetarian, so they make chana vindaloo that he swears by
I've had most of the veg dishes - all good
The samosas chana chaat and naan are good
The only time I was disappointed was with a makhani dish I ordered that was very sweet and once I ordered jalfrazee that I found greasy
Service is good
If you don't order an appetizer or dessert they'll often bring you a little taste of something free
The only thing is you will usually have to catch your waiter to get your check
they don't tend to bring it until you ask
But, on the bright side - you will never feel rushed even when they are packed
Park Slope has needed a really good indian place for a LONG time, and finally, this is it! My husband and I go there probably once a week -- he usally gets the Chicken Tikka and I get the Chana Shaag
Other dishes we've tried and which are fantactic: Chana Aloo, Mixed Vegetable Curry, Chana Chaat, Grilled Meat Appetizer, and of course Naan bread, and rice pudding or some jasmine ice cream for dessert
Delicious! The service is wonderful and the interior has the classic tacky lighting scheme that has gone to be standard in NYC indian restaurants
Perfect!
This place is wonderful
I don't think they've been around that long, as I only noticed them a few months ago
The service is pretty decent
The waiters are friendly as is the owner who is often there
The chicken tikka makhani is delicious
The saag paneer is a bit creamy for my tastes, but still good
And the lamb madras is good and spicy
The portions are not huge, but they are satisfying
If you order delivery or sit in, they often bring you a taste of desert for free
Quite nice
I highly recommend it!
This is a typical Russian lounge, me being Russian it worked out beautifully
Me and my friends got lucky on a Friday night we DIDN'T get carded =)~
We were taken to the basement which is AWESOME we had the whole floor to ourselves with nice trance music in the background and a jungle like atmosphere
Prices are average, service on a good night is probably good we unfortunately got a new waitress she did not know what she was doing
Overall this is a nice place to go to after you went out to either dinner or a movie, kinda pointless to come here to get drunk since you pay per shot, but still a nice place to go to
To start, Baku is perfectly located - overlooking Sheepshead Bay
They weren't exagerating when they called it Baku Palace, because the place is huge, having the potential to accomodate weddings, bar mitzvas or any other large parties while still serving other guests who prefer to dine outside the main room
Their menu is thick, rivaling some of the local diners, however that's where the similarities end
However, regardless of what you might order, the dish will be savory and perfectly prepared
There's a deffinate Persian/Medditaranean inclination in the dish offering, however, they serve French and Continetal food as well
If forced to classify their fare would be placed in the Ecclectical-Fusion category (if such even exists)
But who cares about labels - their food is great, the srvice is friendly and attentive (although a few english lessons would serve them well) and the ambiance is second to none
Baku is a great restaurant but can only be enjoyed by those who have a liking for those kinds of dishes
Their shishkibab is the best and the dancers are awesome
As this restaurant is a favorite (in Brooklyn) of my ethnicity, I enjoy dancing with my family and they are very friendly
The waiters are proffesional and attentive, and I recommend this restaurant
They speak Russian! ( by the way) But, if you prefer something different, nearby restaurant XO serves the best crepes-ever- and Passage has magnificant fine dining and music
we were recently in baku to celebrate mom's birthday
great selection on the menu
cubed liver is moist and tasty, for main dish go with lamb chops they were very juicy and well prepared
for desert you must try their own tea that comes served for the whole table with side of different jams and have baku's blintzes, made right in front of you with ice cream and fresh fruit
the ambiance is great
we sat on the second floor balcony with a breeze coming from the canal
for those who got chilly the restaurant provided blankets
listen to the suggestions of the waiters they are very attentive and will tell you what is recommended (they were right on the money)
full dinner with drinks and appetizers and desert will run you about $50 per person and it is definitely worth it
I came here with a large group
The staff was extremely accommodating in meeting our needs
The service was excellent
I thought the food was very good, though others thought that the nearby Armenian place is better, for half the price
The atmosphere is wonderful
The music is very pleasant
The food has some traditional Azerbaijani dishes, as well as some French food, such as frog legs and escargot
I will definitely come here again
Most of the time the food is great, but atmosphere and service made up that one time when the food was not as good as usually
And we got complimentary champagne that day
Actually, everyone in the restaurant did
I recommend making reservations for the main room (on the second floor)
Try to get there between 9 and 10 and stay till closing (at least 2 am)
The table is yours for the night, there is no second seating
You can go on the dance floor (live band every Fri, Sat and Sun) and return an hour later your own table
Don't be afraid to order a Banquet dinner
Everything will be served family style and you'll try very many interesting dishes
Klatch is a kitchy university coffee house right in the midst of Manhattan's Financial District, which is a completely unexpected blessing
With their off-beat pastries and dark, rich coffees, not to mention lunch specials that include haute dogs, it's a great place for a morning eye-opener or a lunchtime breather
The staff is friendly and sociable, and the art rotates regularly
In slower periods it invites you to pull out your laptop and write studious, thoughtful graduate essays
Not much seating space though, so during prime-time you may have to get your goodies to go and walk a couple blocks to the waterfront or to City Hall Park
Recently had dinner at Malagueta after several failed attempts

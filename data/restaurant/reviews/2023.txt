And Whole Foods for that matter - and NONE of those places uses processed ingredients
This place is all hype - like most places made famous on Sex And The City
i tried magnolia for my first time last week, and i bought another batch today
the frosting is thick and sweet
i love magnolia, but STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING PASTEL
the pastel icings are nasty
the cupcakes are a little bit too highly priced at $1
75 each
THE COOKIES ARE DIVINE
Really, what's the deal with cupcakes? They really aren't that good and after reading so much about this place, I thought I would give it a try and see if it would convert me into a cupcake lover
In the end, it only affirmed my dislike for them (this, coming from a dessert lover who will almost eat anything sweet)
They are merely spongelike cakes in a cute cup with overly sweet icing on them
So what if they are pink? After saying that, I would, however, recommend the cheesecake here
It is maybe one of the best and under-rated one that I have ever had
I suffer from a terrible sweet tooth so when I visited New York my friends took me here, knowing full well I would love the place
The famed cupcakes are delicious -- personally, I like the cavity-inducing sugary sweetness of the icing -- not to mention pretty; they were almost too good looking to eat! The cupcakes go great with a cold glass of milk, you can order it skim or whole
The staff are incredibly friendly amiable
The bakery itself is actually quite tiny fills up pretty easily
So grab your sweets head for the park across the street
This is a must if you're in the West Village area
Located on the very quaint yet trendy Bleecker Street, grabbing a dessert from Magnolia and chomping it down as you stroll around the area is one of my favorite things to do on days with beautiful weather
The cupcakes are yummy indeed but on the sweet side so just one is quite enough
Both the chocolate and the vanilla cakes are moist and tasty
They're great with ice cold milk too
Many people rave about the banana pudding
There is a table an a couple of chairs inside but it gets really crowded on weekends and there's a cupcake bouncer doing crowd control so I don't recommend it as a sit-down place
These were the sweetest, most overrated cupcakes I have ever tasted
If you want to get the experience of these cupcakes without waiting on the line, do yourself a favor
buy a box of domino confectionary sugar and dip your tongue in for about 3 minutes and swallow as much sugar as you can
Who knows what the flavor of the cupcakes are, you never get the flavor because each bite is overwhelmed with this terrible overly sugary icing
When I removed the icing to taste the cupcake I realized that a modification on Duncan Hines does a better job
Stay away this place is not worth the hype
Often duplicated, never accomplished
Magnolia is the best bakery in the US
The cup cakes are outstanding and are one of a kind
Grab a box and eat across the street in Bleecker Park
You cant go wrong with this place! I love Magnolia, wish there was one on the west coast! I have been to Magnolia dozens of times, and have never walked away disappointed!
Magnolia Bakery cupcakes are not as good as they were when it was a neighborhood establishment and the cupcake craze was new
The frosting is overly sweet, and the cake can be dry
However, I disagree with those who exaggeratedly call them disgusting, and would like to point out that cake made with fresh ingredients cannot be as soft as that made with oils and preserved fat solids, like one from a box
If you go to Magnolia (which I did often, in the '90s), I recommend you get a slice of a whole layer cake
Not only do they have a wide variety, but they cut slices genereously, and to order
Their banana pudding is classic
The cupcakes are cute, but not worth the line you will find on weekends or evenings due to hype
Overall, it is worth a try for the delicious smell, and old-fashioned bakery experience
This was my first trip to NYC and I really wanted to to the Magnolia Bakery because of all the SATC hype etc
That said, I loved the old fashioned mint green and shabby chic kinda decorating
The cupcakes however were horrible
Perhaps, a couple of years ago, before they became so popular, the food was actually much better
I cannot swear to that though because I don't know
The supermarket actually makes better cupcakes than this
I can't even really describe the taste
The chocolate cupcake tasted sorta minty
It was just really bad
My daughter got a chocolate cookie and wasn't impressed either
We waited in line for about 15 minutes
I don't know why some people are so excited about these cupcakes
Are they just buying into all the hype and turning their taste buds off? Perhaps so
cupcakes were a big craze in baking the past few years, cropping up everywhere and replacing traditional cakes at weddings
i wasn't too interested when i followed a friend in to Magnolia but after experiencing their signature dessert i was struck
by how UNIMPRESSIVE it was
i'm a baker/cake designer (self-taught)
i love homestyle desserts as long as they taste great and are halfway presentable, but these cupcakes are cute at best and fall flat in the taste department too
like many others, i felt the cake seemed almost stale
it's dry, crumby, and not dense enough to support a frosting
the frosting was intensely sweet and not rich enough to be a pure buttercream or light and airy enough to be a swiss buttercream
it sort of slipped off the cupcakes and had a creepy, almost translucent appearance
magnolia's other desserts may be better, but their cupcakes aren't tasty
they're trendy
These are the best cupcakes I have ever tasted in my life
My daughter and I talk about them all the time
You pick a box up
Fight the other people in the bakery
Race to the window and get as many as you can
By the time you get home they are smashed together
Nobody cares because they are sooooo good
If I could have them mailed to my house in Florida
I would have a weekly delivery
We spend a month in New York every year
We cannot wait to go to Magnolias
If you are one of those people who scoops the icing off the cake and tucks it safely on the side of the cake so you can enjoy the cake alone, this place is not for you
There is no hype at all with the cupcakes
They are sickeningly sweet which is what makes them pure heaven for sugar worshippers
Yeah, the cake could probably be a little bit more moist, but I'd like to see anyone on this website reproduce the texture and taste of that icing
It's divine
To appreciate the value of the cupcakes you have to LOVE sugar
I know it's really bad for you, but now and then it's fun to indulge
I've never had any other baked good from Magnolia - but I wouldn't
Why bother? Taste for yourself
As with everything else in New York, you're paying for the experience
These cupcakes are no better than what you make in your own kitchen
In fact yours may be better
It's all hype
But the village is fun and if you get the chance, check it out
Any cupcake is better than no cupcake
I have absolutely NO idea why this place gets such raves on Citysearch and similar sites; the cupcakes are not very impressive, unless all you care about is sweetness (there are ABSURDLY sweet)
The workers are not the most polite, but that is almost to be expected at a place this popular, so I do not hold it against them
What boggles my mind is why this place is so popular; it is truly mediocre
To say it is overrated would almost be giving it a compliment; even if people did not line up to get in, I would still consider this place not-so-great
I did not actually go to the bakery, but I did find the recipe online and bake them at home

It is not worth $20 for sure
The fried oyster was good, although you can find it in other restaurant too
It's not worth the wait
Having tried Pearl for dinner, went there for lunch and it too was FANTASTIC! I have never had a better lobster roll and fries! Can't wait to go back!
BEST SEAFOOD in town
Never disappointed with the food and service
Worth the wait!
What's the BEEF? There should be NONE! IT is the BEST SEAFOOD in town
Wish there was more room, but the wait is worth it for all the great food and service
Love their food, always the freshest
Wish it was easier to get a table
Be there when they open at 6pm
Open for lunch too
I've been there many times and have waited each time to get in and I am looking forward to going back
That is how good Pearl is
The seafood is about as good and fresh as you can get it outside of Maine or Cape Cod
The food has been consistently good
The lobster roll and fried oysters are to die for
My only complaint is the LONG waits and expensive prices, but its worth it!
In Short Simple charms--exposed brick, breakaway doors, lacey curtains, and ceiling fans--enhance this reliable neighborhood favorite, where specials are written in marker on butcher paper, water comes in recycled wine bottles and wine is served in tumblers
There's no pretension on the simple menu either, which ranges from homemade pastas like tagliatelle Bolognese to heartier entrees like a plate-sized chicken cutlet adorned with arugula, tomato and a squirt of fresh lemon
Malatesta is favorite restaurant in Manhattan! Though I would love to keep it a neighborhood secret, I find myself recommending it to everyone I know!
I eat at Malatesta about once a month, and while I often sample different appetizers and desserts, rarely can I keep myself from ordering the Spaghetti alla Chitarra as my entree
They are, in a word, SQIUSITI (exquisite)
And virtually unique to this restaurant
Clams and mussels in white wine are divine, and the mixed bruschetta appetizer is delicious and great for sharing
They also have a good, reasonably-priced list of wines by the 1/2 carafe, great for 2 people
Most nights there is a lively, mixed crowd (many Europeans), and always a colorful and welcoming staff, in an authentic northern Italian taverna setting
I have been here three times and it was great all three times
I would highly recommend this place
I live across the street from this restaurant, and it is one of the best places to go for a quick bite, or to bring an out-of-towner
Almost all the pasta dishes are homemade, and the specials are great! You really feel like you are in Italy when they bring the water in old wine bottles, and the specials are hand written on a piece of paper
There is never a long wait for a table, but the place is consistantly buzzing with plenty of customers
Overall a great place if you are craving Italian!
It was like being in a trattoria in Italy- from the furniture, the decor, the waitstaff, the menus, the glasses to the actual food
With its elegant simplicity, this is a great place for a cozy dinner
And to top it off, you won't break the bank- all the food is reasonably priced, so indulge!!
Cozy, friendly, delicious
This is modern style Italian - very fresh - plates are not enormous, but the prices are very reasonable
I eat here at least 2 times per month
I don't know anyone who orders a 3 course meal, but you can eat here for under $20, easy
Only complaint - Christopher street is unappetizing - don't sit outside
This place didn't disappoint
My fiance and I went on a wednesday night for dinner
The food was very reasonably priced and very tasty
She had a mushroom salad and cheese ravioli in pink sauce
Both were great
I had grilled calamari and the grilled monk fish special
Both were great
The wine list is small but has winners on it and the prices are well within reason
we went on a weeknight so no reservations were needed but I'm not sure about weekends
MAN!, this is what you hope to find in NYC after you got back from an Italian vacation
I discovered it 2 months ago and since then I'm going at least twice a week!! SOO GOOD! The all crew is REAL Italian, funny in their inarticulated English, their manager is professional and charming with his educated manners, and the food
just affordable AND good, simple but incredibly tasty
You will just figure out soon why many celebs rather eat Maletesta than Man Ray or The Park
ITS THE AMORE! Cash ONLY is really awkward but the lambchops alone are worthed the withdraw at the near ATM
Food is very light and tasty, the atmosphere is casual and friendly
Perfect setting for a first date as this place def
isn't the run of the mill Italian she's been to a thousand times
Although everything is usually amazing, the specials are always best--def
stick around for dessert it's the perfect combination of artwork and incredible taste
Know that it's CASH only and usually crowded on weekend nights, but I've never needed a reservation
In Short This cozy tile-floored storefront, with just a handful of tables and an open kitchen, is beloved for brunch
Locals wind down into the weekend with fluffy omelets and sandwiches served on wooden cutting boards with fried-to-order frites
For dinner, the menu leans toward heartier appetites, with specialties like the blanquette de volaille a l'ancienne--a Belgian chicken pot-pie, minus the crust
The wine and beer list includes many reasonably priced options
This place is a true WV gem that gets all the variables right
The omelettes are fluffy, french toast perfect, and the coffee's strong, served in a big white beautiful mug
The host has been there for as long as I've lived in the neighborhood (7 years), and he never fails to be pleasant and accomodating
I'm dreaming about their crisp french fries as we speak
This is a wonderful treat, nestled into the sleepy Hudson Street locale for anyone visiting the west side
With adorable dining furniture and candle light, this cafe makes for a romantic dinner, but just get there early enough to secure a table you like, as the limited amount makes it a hard-come-by find
if so, you'll love all the Tintin paraphenalia
but don't let that fool you, the food is great and the place is open late
Granted, we were a bit drunk, but we _always_ are
Excellent mussels, steak, salads, I think we even had dessert, several bottles of wine, and they not only brought our food but didn't kick us out! Come to think of it, they did seem to change servers mid-meal -- maybe it was the end of the shift? anyhow -- highly recommended, I'll be back!
They gave the place a facelift without taking away the feel of the place
new floors, lighting, seating with the same great jukebox
You're still not walking into some chic joint, it's still Barrow's Pub
If you want to wait two hours to shoot one game of pool or tables that tip in your lap or to be ignored by the bartender or enjoy stepping around soft spots in the floor, this is the place for you
This isn't even a good dive; a dive would be upscale
Seems like a lot to go through just to hear a good jukebox
Cool, out of the way neighborhood dive
Pool table, bar food, and booze
The jukebox is absolutely incredible, it's got everything you could think of
The service is very warm and personable
But, as I said, it's a dive bar, so it's not someplace you'd take a high-maintenance individual
Charming and unpretentious, Sweet Life serves up hearty fare including great omelettes, pan crepes, freshly squeezed juice and the best pink lemonade (made from fresh lemons) ever
We truly recommend you while away a few hours at this cosy West Village diner for brunch
This is the best little coffee shop in the neighborhood
The food's great, the service is super-friendly
Dolly, the proprietor, is a sweetheart
They make you feel like family
The Scene Since 1954, this cozy West Village joint has been serving up solid Southern comfort to plain folks and the slavish celebs whose photos bedeck the warm pink walls
The Food It's a hearty soul who can chow through an entire dinner special, and many have been known to toss in the towel after gobbling down the two included sides
Rich mac and cheese and buttery grits may not be kind to the thighs, but they do the soul a world of good
After glimpsing a neighboring table's smothered chicken or succulent barbecued pork, most find a way to soldier on
Finish with bread pudding and leave a better person for it
I'm not one to write reviews about anything, but since an hour later I still smell like the chicken brick I had there, I may as well give something back
Ok, so it was dead quiet

Despite the fact that no one was in the room, the hostess attempted to seat me in the corner next to the busboy station
When I asked for a better table, she refused to seat me at any of the better, available tables
The food was totally ordinary - like a 3rd rate caterer on Long Island
Waitstaff was poor and annoying (my waiter was either drunk or just very weird
Prices were high for such poor food and service
With all the good restaurants in NY, there is no reason on God's green earth to go to Tavern on the Green
My sister took me to this enchanting restaurant for my birthday dinner on Monday
Our food was excellent and we both had the best steak we had ever eaten
The service was above par and although it was expensive, we felt that the atmosphere made it all well worth it
We will go back the next time we visit NYC
while on vacation, we enjoyed brunch at Tavern on the Green! The food was overall very good! And you can't beat the atmosphere! Just bring a lot of cash or a high end credit card! our bruch, with tip, (for 2 people) was $130
Granted we got a shell fish appetizer
but alot of moola still
worth it? yea, probably
but would probably try another famous ny landmark (aka can't say i would rush right back there)
My other half and I often visit Tavern On The Green and we always have decent food and wonderful service which would be expected from this type of establishment, please do not give them a bad name because you can not afford them
I would not go to Tavern on the Green for the food
It's good to impress your date if she/he has not been there
Service is also slow, so make sure you are happy with the date
I took a very special friend of mine for his birthday and although the food was good
the service was so slow you wait forever for your meal
I kind of though it was rediculious to have to tip two people but hell that's New York
I know that everyone always says the food here is just okay
We always go when in New York
The place is sooo big and fun to walk around
The staff is very friendly and willing to take your picture
The food is fine, but the kids' menu is limited and a bit pricey
We love going here
I made my reservation and mentioned it was my birthday
I noticed on my reservation list I could see it was noted however it was never brought up even though it was celebrated at other tables with baloons ect
food was good but for a little more money its much better with better service at Lutese or the like
Nice atmosphere, glad I went, but once was enough for one lifetime
my experience there was excellent
Everything was very good
But, the lobster bisque was the best i've ever tasted
It has the ultimate flavor
Even my three year old son (who eats nothing) loved it
One bowl is just not enough
The manager on duty (I think his name was Chris) was superb, as was the greeting we received in the foyer
The wait staff was second to none and the Food was delicious
I'd have to say that our experience was well worth the price of admission (i
e
Value)
I've read some of the reviews and notice that only complainers post messages, so I wanted to buck the trend
Thanks for a wonderful time tavern and we will be returning in the near future!! -- THE WORD
My mom and 2 aunts went here with high expecations and were so dissapointed
Our food was awful and the waiter was not friendly
Our bill was over $400 and we left hungary and upset
Such a beautiful location though
I will never go back
not for those prices
Ha! This would have been special if I wanted to be treated like a cow
Wait in line 30 minutes to check my coat, wait in line 15 minutes to get to the host, get sent down a long narrow CROWDED hall to wait 30 minutes to just get to the dining room, Moo-Moo! I was so ANGRY and STRESSED, by the time the staff person said our table was ready I said NO!! and left without even eating! It is a beautiful surrounding, but not worth the aggravation
(Note: I had reservations and was still was herded
for 100+ per person that is not right
)
well, the bathroom is cool! its got like everything u would ever need in a bathroom
lol
the place is very pretty!!! and the food is pretty good
my bread was like reeally tough though
it was still good
the waiters and everything were very nice
the french fries were also good
and the cheesecake
Wonderful location, outstanding views and very good food
Some will say it's over-priced but, you always get what you pay for, and besides, this is a very different type of dining
(not for everyone)  Sunday Brunch with the New York Times and this place is th e best
I wouldn't waste the cash myself on overpriced, unspectacular food and contemptuous service
But this is a fabulous place for parties
Buffet fare is better than the regular menu and you don't have to deal with the waitstaff
If someone else is footing the bill, GO! The visual assault alone is something to be experienced
Decor is like a baroque acid trip to Wonderland
And it's one of those only in NYC experiences
Best around Christmas, especially if snowing
Beware: bathroom obstructed by large velvet, bejeweled maze
This is such a beautiful site within Central Park
Even though the resturant can be booked solid, it never seems crowded bacause of the surrounds of the park
I thought I'd treat my family to a nice lunch in New York
Three hours later and still waiting to finish our meal, I definitely had some strong second thoughts about Tavern on the Green
The wait staff ignored us and when, after an hour, we piped up about our final course we were treated to rude service and remarks
It wasn't until we spoke with management that we were able to finish our meal and get out of the restaurant, but already one of our party had to leave early and the rest of us were late for our afternoon engagements
Overall a pricey disappointment
Went expecting over-the-top decor and so-so food
The food turned out to be a surprise; it was great
Had the filet and it was done just right and tender and favorful
The service was a little aloof at he beginning but that tyrned around into friendly, helpful, prompt service
The prices may be high, but everybody has to come here at least once
My friends and I were visiting NYC for my 40th birthday and brunched at Tavern on the Green on a Saturday
The weather was wonderful and dining in the garden was just what I'd imagined
The food was good, and except for the overpriced Mimosa, not a bad value for New York
Our waitress was one of the best we had while visiting - she even brought over balloons for the table after learning of my birthday! Its the little things that make a trip and a restaurant memorable
This place has a split personality
I've been there for a few special events (movie premier parties, wedding) and the food and service were outstanding, truly world-class
But I've taken a few visiting friends and family here for dinner and the food was awful, the tables crowded, and the service perfunctory at best
I live on the UWS and have been wanting to check this restaurant out for awhile - having finally had a chance to dine here, sadly it may be the last time
Chunks of food in the water, no candle brought to the table after the waiter said he would get one, and shoddy service at best
The waiter took the order and we never saw him again until we flagged him down for the check (mind you our table had been cleared and we were sitting at the table sans food and wine for a good 10 minutes)
Food was alright but certainly nothing amazing and the prices are good
This place has potential but was unimpressed and service ruined the experience
This place is great

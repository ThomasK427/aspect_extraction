It's not like they weren't niiiice
Their service needs some work, but it is safe to say that you will enjoy the food
I had lunch at Bliss today
The food was pretty good -- nothing to write home to Manhattan about, but OK
One thing was very off-putting, though: One of the people who works there was getting a MASSAGE in the back of the restaurant
sort of crouched in a chair, leaning over a table, while someone did that obnoxious karate chop sort of thing on her back for way too long
In fact, two seconds would have been way too long
I thought this was a restaurant, not a massage parlour
I'll stick to Caravan of Dreams, across the river
Highly recommend the salads, breakfast burrito, pancakes and desserts
Service can be pretty sketchy, but they mean well
I was about to give up on Thai, I really was
There's only so many lackluster chains and pad thais anyone can stand until they throw in the towell
Well, thankfully, I found Cheers
Cheers is REAL thai food, made by a lovely family in Williamsburg
Forget Sea, forget Spice, this is the real thing
The Bosom Friend dish with shrimp and calimari is pretty much irresistable
They can spice it up past cracker levels for you, too, and that's well appreciated
Whenever I leave NY, Cheers is one of the places I make sure to eat before my trip
I've had a lot of Thai food over the years
This was distinctively average
It's true that delivered food usually isn't as good as its dined-in version, but in this case, it wasn't the travelling that made it average
I had Pad Thai
The sauce on the noodles was too limey and the chicken in the Pad Thai was bland--it didn't even taste like chicken
For me, it was a very unfortunate experience and I do not plan to go back
It's incredibly yummy: smokey, fresh, perfectly cooked japanese eggplants
Tom Yum soup was excellent as well
My boyfriend and I have been to a lot of good Thai restaurant and we decided to venture to Cheers after reading good reviews on it and coz it is close to where we live
It is very pricey considering the place is in Williamsbury with not much decor
Food was not good at all
My non-thai friends cook better Thai food than this place
We got fried ice-cream for dessert and it was BAD
the worst we have experienced~!!   One good advice
if you want reasonably priced good food, go to SEA THAI BISTRO instead
Their decor is GREAT and prices are much cheaper than Cheers
the food was really good, we walked in without reservations (We called ahead, were told we didn't need it) and were asked to wait a few seconds while they cleared a table some people were finishing at, while their were other tables that could fit us ready and waiting
Appetizers and drinks came on time, but we waited 40/45 minutes for entrees
I had the panyang curry, which i loved
but the other meals which were not spicy, were kind of bland
The meat was great, but vegetables needed flavor and etc
Meal for four ran us about 50 dollars, only one dessert
They had three tables which were uglier and seemed to sit the non-trendies/not as well dressed people their
(people next to us were a family with two babies and a guy with a Vanilla Ice haircut)
My lovely boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and it's really a perfect spot for inexpensive, tasty food
We sat in the garden out back, and the calm atmosphere with the waterfall rock wall on the side completed the setting
The waitstaff was exceptionally nice and unobtrusive, and made the food spicy according to your liking
I reccommend this highly to anyone looking for a nice night out to dinner
Get the Thai iced tea-- it's yummy
I first discovered Cheers Thai when it first opened around three years ago and kept going at least three times a month
I live in the neighborhood and used to go to Planet Thailand, where I'd wait for an hour or more and then be ultimately unsatisfied with the food and service
The staff at Cheers is very friendly and accomodating
The food is excellent and, unlike Planet Thai, comes out at the same time as the rest of your party's food
You don't have to beg for a table or service
The backyard garden rocks
My recommendations: broccoli with basic or Tao Hu Hor
The steamed veggie dumplings are also amazing
I can't say enough about Cheers! The moment I walk in the door there is a freindly- SINCERE- smile, then my order is taken by the nicest people in this whole stinkin' city, then when it arrives it is always just exactly the way I want it
I had tried Thai several times in the past but was never impressed (once I even got violently ill)
But
then came Cheers
My wife and I eat there every opportunity we get
The ambience is amazingly calming and the quality and quantity of food is excellent
I highly, highly recomment it
The garden is wonderful and very romantic
BUT- whatever you do- DONT go to YUM YUM BANGKOK in midtown west (44W and 9th)- they are rude and the food is bland as it comes
The Scene This wooden bar is packed after dark with a loyal neighborhood crowd
People waiting for tables stand at a drink rail next to large windows which open out over a leafy garden in the summertime
The mood is always upbeat--but rarely wild--with Latin music drowning out the ceaseless whirl of the margarita maker
Service is fast and friendly
The Food The free chips-and-salsa may suggest casual Tex-Mex cooking, but this menu is a couple notches above
Ingredients are market fresh and preparations are slightly more innovative than you'd expect
Grilled corn on the cob with mayonnaise and cotija cheese, and cactus leaves with red onion and salsa verde, are standout starts
Main dishes encompass the usuals--like chocolatey chicken mole and grilled flank steak-- well as seasonal specials, like soft-shell crabs with orange tequila sauce
After reading the many reviews that mentioned poor service, we hesitated to try this one, but found the service more than adequate, and the food good
The drinks are awesome
It was raining so we didn't try the garden, but will return to sit out there
The restaurant is narrow and a bit cramped, high-energy (noisy) on a Friday night, with interesting decor
Our waitress was pleasant enough, although a bit unfamiliar with the menu, and immediately there whenever we looked for her, which is certainly a plus
The food is a cut above most Mexican joints in the city
Fried pistachio ice-c is terrific
There is so much better authentic Mexican in this neighboorhood
If you eat here, it's because you just don't know what you're doing
Do yourself a favor and get off of Bedford and adventure into the less trendy parts of the hood
I finally tried Vera Cruz after 2 years of living in the neighborhood! The waitress was very annoying to take my order when i clearly had no idea what i wanted as I hadn't opened the menu yet
she asked me 4 times for my order within 3 minutes of being there - and once I ordered (wild mushroom and steak burritos) she didn't acknowledge me until I flagged her down for the check
The busboys were more helpful than my server who then made me wait at the bar (very crowded with what appeared to be tasty margaritas) to pay the bartender - what's that about? The horrible cold service is all I remember of Vera Cruz - the food and drinks were delicious and fairly priced but the service left a horrible taste in my mouth
My dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I have ever had
I have heard good things about this restaurant and wanted to check it out but the waiters and manager were terribly rude
I am an extremely low maintenance diner and the staff at this restaurant managed to insult my dinner party and refuse kitchen service minutes after seating us and informing us that the kitchen was open
Plus the drinks are overpriced for the area
Alright, so I've only been to Vera Cruz twice, and all these other reviews are raves, so maybe I was just there on off nights, but I've never had such bland Mexican food
The mole was just muddy and the margaritas only got any flavor from the sickly sweet syrups they added
Both nights, my waitresses were kind of chilly
However, the second night, my table was bussed by an incredibly sweet middle-aged Polish woman
All else notwithstanding, it's a nice-looking room with a lovely garden, right by the Bedford L stop
I have no idea what the food is like here, I only come for the frozen margaritas which I find to be the best I've found in the city and the grilled corn
The margaritas have the consistancy of a milkshake with a strong alcohol content
They're worth a trip on their own
weak margueritas but flavorful
good for not getting your date too sauced

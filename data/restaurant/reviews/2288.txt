He reserved for 8
30, only was our table not ready
We had to wait in a room that fit 6 people but had 20 people waiting in + no airconditioning
At 9pm we got a table which was so small we would have been eating on top of each other, those still waiting in the foyer were spilling into our chairs
When our waitress came over she informed us what was NOT available on the menu
My boyfriend had chosen Jojo's for its steak which of course had run out
We stood up and left but not before the coat check took another 15 minutes of my night looking for my umbrella she misplaced
Definately not a nice way to spend my birthday as turned a special night into a total horror!
Loved the food- Oysters were delicious, the filet minion melted in my mouth, and the coconut cake was so good I wanted to just stick my whole face in eat like a savage
Servers were knowledgeable and friendly
Really the only issue was it was so loud! I had to practically scream to talk to my father on the other side of the table
But otherwise, great food
Went to this place with a party of 8
When we got to our table, little did we know that it would be the best part of our dinner
Our server was very slow, and paid little attention to us
He basically disregarded our table
Appetizers were run of the mill
When we got our steak, we were very dissapointed
The filet mignon was dry, and lacked taste
For the price, we truly got hosed on this deal
You can go to outback steakhouse for much better food than this place
I went here for lunch with a few financier colleagues
This colleague I had slapped and wanted to make him feel good by buying him a decent meal
And decent it was! The steak melted in mouth like an MM
The waitress was friendly and personable
This meal certainly made up for the incident
We laughed over teh fantastic chocolate cake
I also recommend the complimentary cookies at the door
there should be no reason to go to this one
Our steaks were over cooked and when mine came back fine, my friend's was still too rare
I waited until her's came back (this time too rare) and wound up eating a cold tasteless steak
For a steak house not to get it right after two times is really unacceptable
Plus the quality of our steaks were not up to standard
Oh, and the wait staff couldn't have cared less that we had a horrible meal
Will never ever go back
I have been here many times in the last few years and always love it
The cajun rib is incredible and the service is always great
I'm not sure why the other reviewers have had so many issues but I have only had great experiences
Don't forget to have the coconut cake!
this place is just awful if you are under 80yrs old
the place is filled with senior citizens, so if you are young and want a fun night out, do not go here
the food is okay, way over priced, you have to pay for side dishes
for a $40 steak, you don't get anything on the side, where at other restuarants you can get veggies, potatos, etc
the worst part is they don't play music
even a little soft classical would be nice in the backgroud, but there is nothing
Great restaurant
Where it separates itself from the other NYC steakhouses is in the decor and service
It's a very classy atmosphere, and it's not an overly masculine place
Although I didn't sample them, the dishes that didn't involve steak seemed to be enjoyed by all who partook of them
Not only a great steakhouse
a great overall restaurant
Went during wine week and had a great experience- never rushed, good full pours on the wine and excellent food
The cajun rib-eye really packs a kick and was cooked to perfection- the sides were delicious and a half order is plenty for three- which the waiter told us rather than letting us over-order
Service was impeccable- friendly and knowledgeable
We lingered after the wine tasting and our waiter was great about bringing us over a few more glasses while we were finishing up
Definitely top notch
My boyfriend and I took his parents there (they used to dine there almost 10 years ago) figuring they'd love it
For starters, we made reservations 4 weeks in advance and were seated in a cramped little corner
Then the food that was served was cold
When we asked the waiters to heat up the food, we got major attitude! If you decide to go, DON'T HAVE THE CHOCOLATE CAKE
We all made the mistake of ordering it
At the end of this terrible dinner, when the bill was paid, the waiter stood right next to our table and counted the $
When he saw that my boyfriend tipped him 25% despite the horrible service, everyone was very friendly and saw us out
Don't waste your money, this restaurant may have been a blast 10 years ago, but there's a good reason why reservations are not necessary at this place!
The bar at the Post House is a fabulous place to stop in for a martini and (for the time being) a cigar
Generous, well-priced portions and a grown-up atmosphere make this a great bar to meet a friend or relax before or after your meal
Ray Gaither, President Fisher Brittany Consultants Brooklyn, NY  The old charm is still there
Oversized portions of well age beef always grilled to perfection
Great staff
As always my steak was excellent and the service outstanding
good job with shrimp cocktail and filet; helpful waiter with wine list and recommendations; host was accomodating as our party in staggered late groups; go
What a disappointment! We had gone to Post House many times over the years and enjoyed excellent food and service
Now the service is awful
Which is worse, waiters that ignore you or that are rude? The worst disappointment was the steak - supposed to be NY Sirloin, $35, and both that we ordered were all fat
We complained and all they offered was free coffee
Don't ever bother with this place
And it was noisy, too
i dont know why people are complaining, i went there recently and found the food still good
the cajun rib was excellent
the ambience is better than your average steakhouse, not smokey and you can actually spot a few women in the restaurant!
The management seems only interested in the 70+ group of folks, with the serving of bland food and the rapid table turn over by the servers
The bartender is truly wonderful and a funny guy, but they use the bar as a waiting place before you are escorted to your table
This could be a fun place, but not with run of the mill food, and the out of site price tag for dining with the elderly
My wife and I have been eating out almost every night for the last 12 years and this is one restaurant we always return to
Lusardi's has consistently excellent, authentic Italian dishes (especially the pastas), a superb wine list with a selection at all price levels, and an old-school staff that always makes us feel welcome
It's also a great place to show out-of-towners what real Italian food is
Quiet and Not crowded, but fabulous Northern Italian
I suggest going in November when Italy harvests its truffles
the truffle dishes are to die for! The old-shool maitre d' will shave fresh truffles onto your risotto con funghi or whatever
oh it's fabulous
And it's cappucino
straight from Florence
Buon Appetito!
While there are a million authentic Italian restaurants in NYC
the majority of them reside in the Upper East Side
Lusardi's is the most authentic of any in Manhattan
Make sure to say hi to Johnny at the bar
possibly the funniest and best bartender in New York
The wine ist is the size of a small encyclopedia
The gnocchi is out of this world

Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do
Indeed, this place looks fresh and taste fresh
Sea food dishes were great and service mistakeless
Very recommended
We ate at FRESH the Saturday of the snowstorm we got to the restaurant an hour early for our reservations and were promptly seated and welcomed
The service was impeccable, the attitudes were very professional, and the waiter was knowledgeable
The Trilogy of Crab and Daurade were impeccable
The atmosphere was quiet early in the evening, but tables quickly filled up
The spacious room absorbed the noise, so it never got overly loud
The owner Eric came over and introduced himself, and upon hearing that I used to cook in New Orleans, introduced me to the Chef as well
I felt welcomed, as if I we had been longtime friends
One week after our wonderful dinner, we received a phone call from the restaurant thanking us for dining with them and expressing their hope that our dining experience was pleasurable
A+ all around! Well be back!
We had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us
Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it? Quite poor service
Our appetizers came pretty quickly, but it was another hour till the entrees showed up
By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse
The only comp we got was some champagne
which wasn't fabulous
Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service
Went for a late weekday lunch
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend
Service was very friendly
Lunch prix fixe of $25 or $35 allows some mixing and matching (with price supplement), but I was happy to go with the variety on the lower-priced menu
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance
Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves
Loved the attentive host, the dining room, the general buzz
Our rather odd waiter brought the wrong glass of wine for my wife
When I requested a replacement, he instead presented the bottle from which he poured the wrong wine
Thanks so much! The oysters were outstanding, fresh and accompanied by a lovely mignonette
For $26, my wife's St
Peter's fish was disappointing, while my $29 charred tuna was flavorful, though lukewarm
But onto dessert: we shared the sorbet trio and two were comically bad, one tasted of radishes and the other of broccoli
The third was a puckering lemon flavor, which shone only because the other two were deplorable
The concerned manager treated us to complimentary champagne to atone for wine-gate, which was lovely, but not enough
We loved the ambience, but the service was uninformed and the menu hit-or-miss
For two-thirds the price, I'll patronize Mare every time
I used to love fresh and learned recently that its former chef, Daniel Angerer, had departed
I tried out the new chef hopefull it would still be good and was very disaapointed
The food was not nearly sa good -- my salmon was quite dry, heavy and overcooked despite the fact that it was drowned in sauce, the service was off, timing of our meal was chaotic and disorganized, and the place looked dingy and in need of a make-over
The restrooms were unkept and just seemed run down
I will not be back!
fresh restaurant was amazing
food was delicious and of course fresh
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends
I will be going back very soon
keep up the good work
Hats off to the chef
New items on the menu were a nice touch to the summer nights
I had dinner there last night and the food was amazing
the service was superb and the ambience was romantic
I had a nice time, and the food hit the spot
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want quality seafood
I've been to fresh many times with my husband since we live in TriBeCa and loved chef Angerer's cooking style
We had dinner there last night and everything was different and terrible
Our fish was overcooked and heavily dressed; the service was choppy and awkward and our meals came out at different times
We soon learned that the chef Angerer had left fresh
I would love to know where he went because we are sure to follow, but will certainly not return to fresh unless they clean up their act!
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but i learned that the executive chef, daniel angerer, recently left!
Wow! I was totally blown away! The seafood is unbelievably fresh, and the preparations are delicious--they enhance the fish instead of smothering it
I especially like the halibut
Desserts are also great, especially the carmelized banana cake
Service was excellent--helpful and making suggestions, but not at all pushy
I highly recommend fresh for an all-around great meal
What a lovely, charming restaurant
Excellent service; welcoming wait staff and the freshest seafood
Highly recommend the Oysters (served with an exceptional shallot vinegar)
The Stone Crab and Lobster were superb
Everyone at our table ordered different main courses and everyone was happy
(The only thing to avoid is a strange tasting crab risotto
) We're all going back
I have to agree with the previous poster
I haven't a clue why it didn't get a higher rating
I was there for dinner last night and it was positively perfect
The raw oysters were so fresh (hence the name) that we ordered another half dozen
The main dishes were fantastic and cooked to perfection
The service there was also impecable
It's a very sleek looking restaurant and at night fall, the lights dim and candlelight pretty much takes over for the lighting
I would recomend this to any seafood lover that likes great gourmet food
I have eaten at this restaurant many times since I am a fan of fresh fish
It is a favorite of mine and my clients
We have never been disappointed by the restaurant and they have even created dishes especially for individual tastes
The chef is very pleasant as well as the service
Why it has a lower rating is beyond me
I eat in expense account restaurants at least 2x / week and this one is at the top of my list over many of the more famous spots
Save your money
I was completely underwhelmed by both of our entrees, which is unfortunate because you pay top dollar at Fresh
Below average food, the wait staff was unattentive (Saturday night) and couldn't speak to the menu
i have been to fresh several times and cannot put into words how wonderful the food is
their concoctions are absolutely unique and delicious and every item is truly fresh as can be
my husband orders the lobster roll to start every time we visit and is never disappointed
neither am i when it comes to their oysters -- absolutley fantastic! the only downfall is the lighting (it's awkwardly a little too bright at times
) and unfortunately, the waitstaff performance is 50/50 -- there are a few that are excellent, but also a few that are horrible and inattentive
definitely go, but cross your fingers when you get seated, otherwise, it could be a bit of a bumpy ride
I've been to Fresh many times and it's one of my favorite restaurants
The waitstaff has always been friendly and helpful, the bartenders are nice

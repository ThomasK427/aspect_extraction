If you want to be treated like a King or Queen, Maroons is one of New York City's more exquisite restaurants to dine solo or with friends
As a single patron, I was seated promptly and treated with courtesy
The staff attended to my dining request with an exceptional level of professionalism
The cuisine was exceptually divine and memorable and the dessert, if you have the stomach to accommodate more food, was moist and plentiful
The costs is moderately high for the one patron; for example, the price ranges from $45 to $55
Overall, Maroons is worth the place to visit
I first ate at Maroons awhile back, as part of a group of 10 guys at a guys night out
We immediately noted the excellent service from the wait staff
The waiter was attentive without being pushy, and offered excellent choices to people uncertain about what to eat
Plus, the food was very good
Since then, I've been to two birthday parties with 16 or more people, and I've been very happy with both the food and the service from the staff
The food isn't cheap, but the portions are huge by Manhattan standards
This place has lots of space for large groups and accomodates them really well
It's a good value
I've tried the jerk wings and the meal, a grilled salmon, and snapper and have enjoyed them all
Their drinks are also tasty and not watered down
I'd recommend going there whether you have 2 or 20 people
i just held a graduation party at maroon's, and every single person with us adored it! arlene and her staff were tremendous--friendly, accommodating, enthusiastic
the food--we had all the appetizers and red velvet cake--was TREMENDOUS! the fried green tomatos vied with the jerk chicken for best, but that depends on whom you asked
everyone loved everything
the cocktails were wonderful, and the party could not have been better
In sum: wonderful delicious food, fabulous staff, a perfect place for a party, dinner, whatever
absolutely fabulous
I went here on a date a few months ago, and when my date arrived we waited a few minutes to be seated
I ordered the watermelon martini and loved it! We then placed our order and it seemed like forever before we were served
I must say that the place was packed so we were patient
I later wanted another martini and was unpleasantly surprised by the flavor! I sent it back and when it was returned the flavor was the same!
I was later told that the barmaid had errored - she made it wrong the first time
The portions are small - no doubt, but the food is flavorful! absolutley delicious! I went back later with a friend for lunch - the fried and bbq chickens were delicious
Service was a lot faster too! I will return
Maroons has it all! The service, food and decor make dining at Maroons a real pleasure! The staff is always friendly, making everyone feel as if they dining in their own home
One reviewer mentioned the mac and cheese being spicy! That's the whole point
Maroons is not like every other place you walk into
It's not soul food, it's just a wonderful creative culinary experience
The fried chicken, our favorite, the owner, the sweetest and the drinks exotic and fun! From the south, from Jamaica, from NYC
no matter, if you appreciate great food, Maroons is the place
I hear they are opening up in Harlem! Can't wait for that!!!
We had reservations for a group of 4
We waited for 40 minutes
We were offered a table outside in rainy 50 degree weather! The hostess was pleasant enough but useless
The manager was abrupt
We were told something would be on the house for the inconveniece of the wait
At the end of the meal the manager stopped by and said dessert was on her
We got the $140 bill and she gave us a credit for ONE dessert ($8 value)
Obviously this place is not about pleasing the customers
Resist the temptation to go here! Reservations are pointless
The majority of the food was flavorless or mediocre at best
Ultimately the service takes this restaurant over the top!
A friend and I were visiting from Cleveland and Maroons was highly recommended to us by several people
When we arrived they were just setting up for dinner and they took our name, however, they were seating other walk ins that arrived after us first
When we got our table our waitress was friendly and prompt
The food on the other hand was not good at all
The macaroni and cheese was dry and there was something put in to make it spicy
The greens had no meat, therefore no flavor, and the fried chicken was pretty bland as well
The manager of the restaurant was also not at all friendly
The only upside to thw whole experience was the cornbread, but it was an extremely small piece
Not at all recommended!!!
I've been hearing about maroons from so many people lately and decided to go in for dinner on a friday night
We had reservations and it was still an absolute chore to get a table
the place was a zoo
the wait staff had to maneuver their way through the customers to get from the bar area to the seating area
We didn't get seated for over a half an hour after our reservation time
The host and manager(s) were completely rude and fake
We had oxtail and jerk chicken and it didn't taste caribbean at all
The oxtail was burned and we were served the bottom of the pot
It's not a wonder thought since all the staff is Spanish
The waitress was the only saving grace
Won't go back
TOO HOT, TOO Expensive, and not real carribbean cuisine
the service was terrible
i understand that reservations are a must, but don't try to sit people at subpar tables
the first we were shown was in almost on top of the server drink station
the second was with a prime view of the bathroom, i'm talking 4ft away from the door
we asked for another table and were finally granted one
the the hostess and manager sat us with such sarcasm that we almost left
it seemed to me that they didn't want our patronage
the waitress was wonderful and fine especially under the duress of such a busy night
but the insult was done and there is no easier way to ruin an average meal
so be warned and keep away
Please do not waste your time eating Marooms First we went in the middle of the day at 1pm, no one else was there, but it took 30 minutes for our food to come
Finally some more people trickled in
I had the oxtail and it was not seasoned at all
I am West Indian and I am used to eating good oxtail and it was not, it also looked burned
The place is very small and they give you the tinnest glass of soda and the waitress did not even refill my cup
Please this is a waste of money, you will regret it, if you eat here
I went this past Saturday for my friends Birthday celebration
There was a total of 16 guests who attended this dinner
We didn't feel welcomed at the restaurant
The manager made it quite obvious that she wanted us in and out
Our orders were rushed, and after the staff served us our entrees they did not offer us any dessert or coffee
My friend's birthday cake was a small square piece of bread pudding with a candle in it
The manager started singing happy birthday before she even got to the birthday girl and as she was placing down the cake she snatched my friend's dinner
I just wish the service was just as good as the food
After all of the rushing to get us out of there the guests sat around for a good half hour at an empty table waiting for the check
This is a very small quaint and intimate setting very hip and NY
If you go on the weekends (including Friday) I highly recommend making reservations according to there website they do too
The food is really good and flavorful however the service is slow it took me and my fiance forever to get our food however the owner made up for it by putting our drinks on the house
If you like Soul and West Indian food I recommend Maroons
This is one of my favorite restaurants in NY! The food is ALWAYS excellent and I have been back several times
You must have a reservation but I have always been seated within fifteen minutes and the staff is very cordial

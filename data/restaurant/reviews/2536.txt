But the worst part of the evening was that while we were spending well over $100 on the meal, the owner was complaining that half our party was late (I offered to wait at the bar until we all were there; she sat me anyway), that we took too long to order and that we were staying too long because we wanted to get dessert
I've never been treated so poorly or seen an owner so desperate for turn-over
It ruined our whole night
I went to Samalita's after work with some friends and was pleasantly greeted by Samalita and her attentive staff
Fast forward to three hours, four margaritas (which, by the way were the best frozen strawberry margaritas I have EVER had!) , two orders Chorizo and Papas Quesadillas (the first round was so good that we doubled up!) later, and we had exchanged numerous belly laughs with the woman in charge! What started out as a normal dinner with friends, ended up to be one of the best dinners of my life! I highly recommend this priceless gem in the mostly over-priced Upper East Side!
I went to Samalita's last weekend with a few friends and had a great time! After a long work week it was the perfect place to unwind with a few friends, sip some fabulous margaritas, and munch on some homemade mexican treats
The waitstaff was so friendly and accomodating that it seems impossible to have a negative experience there
Thank you so much for being such a pleasant environment
A restaurant like that is so hard to find nowadays!
I highly encourage you to try this restaurant
I was there last night and Sam herself waited on us
Her family recipes are amazing- go with the steak fagita and you won't be disappointed
It may be a little expensive for normal delivery food but you are getting good sushi for cheaper than what you would pay at Nobu, plus it's delivered right to your door
I really love their house dressing
Their rolls are good and their fish is fresh
The Hibachi plates are also very good
I highly recommend it for delivery or dining in
By the way I ate at the one on 70th and 2nd Ave
If you are looking for good quality sushi, ordered in or dining out, this is it
Great value for high quality rolls and sashimi
We order from here at least once a week and prefer it to its hyped up, more expensive, neighbor Poke
I would recommend the Hawiian roll, fantastic
My friend and I went as they were closing and they insisted we should come in anyway
I ordered the most expensive entree on the menu- the lobster- and they rushed us through the whole meal as if we had come in and ordered coffee and stayed all night
It was a passive aggressive dining experience, if that appeals to you, this is the place
My family and I enjoyed a delicous cuisine in the famous roman resteraunt tevere84, i reccomend it to everyone out thier cause its expensive but you get what you payed my beautiful family joined me and my lovely wife while we celebrated our joyous 28 years ofmarriage
if you want a family experience thier is no better than the italians
Asides from the outrageous price its an event that everyone in the family could enjoy
Small, beautifully decorated restaurant
Unquestionably, one of the top kosher spots in NYC
Tevere 84 has tasty not so common delicacies
Fine Italian meat dishes prepared to perfection
Very cute italian place on UES
Everyone I went with was very impressed by their meals - fresh food and a great atmosphere
Would definitely go again
I no longer live on the Upper East Side and I really miss this place
The atmosphere is wonderful to eat in, get an outside table if possible, the service is great, and they have a full bar
Try the shrimp lettuce wraps, the kung pao chicken, and the grand marnier shrimp
Everything is delicious
Their ribs and free appetizer spicy cucumbers ARE TO DIE FOR
Everything is delicious - general tso's chicken is very yummy as well
The newly rnovated rest
is a great place to relax and unwind
I went with a friend visiting me in NY 2 days after moving into this UES neigborhood
Atmosphere is amazing, live band in the front, outdoor seating if you brave the hot summer nights, very nice lighting and overall the food was OUTSTANDING
this burger stands about 1 ft in height
I honestly pondered if it could be squished to fit in my mouth, (and it did)
Absolutely a great spot to take a date, or for a jazzy meal with a friend
good wine and good eats
Price could come down, but for good food it's worth it
After a very nice glass of french chardonnay wine (
Chablis), we decided to have a romantique dinner thanks to the bartender who told us about the food! That was a good experience! Thanks to the waiter, who helped us to choose a nice bottle of Margaux from Bordeaux, congratulations to the chef !  I had the Cassoulet : That was delicious! Will be back
Went here with my husband on a Saturday night for dinner since the place looked like it had great atmosphere
The decor was very nice but the service was horrific
First off, we had to ask for some bread
After finishing our cocktails, we called the waitress over to order wine
About 15 minutes later we still hadn't gotten the wine so we asked for it again
I also had to call her over to ask for more water
The entrees came so late after the appetizer that it was cold
It probably would have been good had it not been sitting in the kitchen for 20 minutes too long
The inattentive waitress and poor service ruined the experience for both of us
I would not recommend this place
After reading all of the reviews on BJs, I was shocked by my experience
Everyone's dish arrived to the table cold and almost tasteless
All of the staff is clearly unhappy to work there by their gruff and hateful behavior
After our order and bill being screwed the manager barked at us
Finally, the prices are ridiculous for what you get - add another $10 per person and go to a top restaraunt
I am sure the owner must have friends and family writing their reviews
Great service great environment!!!! The staff are very accomidating
Brasserie Julien will be one of my regular haunts as its friendly staff makes me feel right at home
Very comfortable
It is great for social gatherings whether business or pleasure
I threw a 30th B day party at Brasserie Julien the food wasgreat and the live music
Upon my arrival, I was greeted with wonderfull hospitality
The Manager greeted us and escorted us to a table
We started off with drinks: a great selection and fast service
We came to Brasserie Julien for the first time to celebrate our fourth year anniversary
It was fabulous
It was great to meet the chef
My husband took me here for our wedding anniversary
It was a very romantic setting with low lighting and comfortable seatings
The staff was very attentive and even friendly (which can sometimes be hard to find in NY)
The food was unbelievable! I can honestly say it was one of the most delicious meals I have had in a long time
I had the Kobe steak and my husband had the rack of lamb
Both were tender and wonderful
After dinner the manager came over and offered us a free dessert to wish us happy anniversary
I thought it was a very nice touch and I was impressed with their customer service
It was such a pleasant experience, I had to write a review
The food can be a little pricey but trust me, it is worth every penny!
Having visited Brasserie Julien, 5 times in all, they make me feel like family
After another restaurant lost our reservation on the upper East, we tried Brasserie Julien
I enjoyed their duck in a way that I didn't know it could taste, not the usual a l'orange
I was also impressed by their wait staff, and am fortunate to never have had a bad experience, only great ones
We love Brasserie Julien so much that we have introduced our 12 year old daughter to the place because of its inviting warm family type seating
We have never felt as if she was out of place, of course we've dined early
But even on New Years, when they were busy, the owners took the time out to visit our table frequently, even pouring us drinks herself from her own creations
I found a true gem and friends at Brasserie Julien
One of the great things about this restaurant is the music! Great Jazz on weekends! The atmosphere is romantic and the food is also
Great the duck and salmon were also delicious
Steak portions were not only large but delicious as well

Maybe the glitterati types are privy to a different caliber of food and service at Butter, but for us average folk, it's strictly Amateur Hour
After waiting over 30 minutes for our reservation (when they said it would be 10) I found bread plates with leftover butter still on it and lipstick on my glass
We were totally ignored by the waitstaff and finally left
The restaurant looks cool, but the way we were treated was appalling
Take your business elsewhere
I have been here 3 times, and every time has been amazing
The food is superb, the desserts are out of this world (the chocolate cake was to die for)
I suggested this place for a bridal shower, and now all the girls know me as the one with great taste and come to me for restaurant suggestions
The service is great, they give you time to enjoy your food, and there is no rush
They leave you alone, but are immediately available when you need anything
The decor is also beautiful
A girfriend and I went to Butter despite mixed reviews for restaurant week
The food tasty - atmosphere incredible
Expensive drinks? check
but they are balanced by the very friendly priced menu
Good looking people? check
including most of the staff
Great food? check
not everything
but most things
wow  Solid service? check
well at least plentiful and attitude-free  Butternut squash soup was spot-on yummy
genius
It's worth going here just to see the amazing space and try this soup
Halibut was also outrageous
Veal the portion size
OMG! The hyped kobe empandas were good and the pasta so-so
rapsberry biegnets another OMG! 4 of us, just under $200 with tip, and then drinks downstairs in the breathtaking (but hot) lounge
Our waiter was cute vivacious and all in all a good experience in noho, a wasteland of attitude and poor food
It's clear the food is prepared with quality ingredients at Butter
Last week was my first visit, and I'd love to go back
The prices were reasonable, the service was knowlegeable and friendly, the atmosphere is hip, we walked in and didn't have to wait that long for a table, and the food was great
Have the beef carpaccio--excellent! The calamari was delicious, too
My dining companions had steak and the veal and enjoyed both thoroughly
My cavatappi pasta was well prepared--thank god no mushy pasta--but I would've liked a little more pancetta in the dish
This restaurant is busy, and for a reason that goes beyond hype!
Went to Butter for restaurant week and it was amazing from the beginning when we walked through the door
The atmosphere is great
There is a club downstairs so if you are there late, then you can hang out at the bar upstairs and hear the music from downstairs
Food and service were both fabulous
I highly reccommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone
Butter has really come along way
I would say it's restaurant and food is at par with its club and lounge, which was not the case when we went there 3 years ago
My husband and I went here for our anniversary and everything was perfect
From the moment we walked in the door the staff were fantastic, really friendly and accomodating
I couldn't choose between sitting upstair or downstairs so they told us to have a look around and let them know when we had decided
We choose to sit in the main level dining room
Our waitress was really good, she went out of her way to research some wine for us
The food was fantastic, I had the duck and it just melted in my mouth
Strawberry shortcake for dessert was just out of this world
I've recommended this place to lots of people
Having only 2 nights left during our trip to NYC from London and after a tremendous disappointment at the Rainbow Grill the night before a friend suggested we check out the Butter
What a nice surprise
The food was great and service very attentive
The lobster salad for starter was the best I have ever tasted! The warm chocolate cake for dessert - simply heavenly
The dessert wine suggested by the waiter - absolutely spot on, and because we are from London we don't usually tip but I made sure to give him a couple extra dollars
After dinner we were lucky to get downstairs for some more really great cocktails and dancing
The owners were amongst the guests and we felt really taken care of
It was like a great therapy session we needed
Every time we go to Butter, whether it's for their incomparable lunch or the genuinely fun and elegant dinner service, we have an outstanding time
To me this is the epitome of a New York restaurant: artistic food ingredients and presentation; a young, very attractive, and knowledgable staff; great downtown location; intelligent and well-maintained design of the space; stylish fellow diners; and an all-around good vibe every time I walk in the joint
a must-go
I know I can't get enough!
This is one of my favorite restaurants
First of all, there is lots of eye candy: the staff clientele
The drinks are delicious
The menu changes each season
The food is contemporary American always inventive, sophisticated fun
Save room for the raspberry beignets at the end
They also have a hot club on the weekends
My experience was awesome! 1st of all, the ambience is pretty damn cool with the trees
I have absolutely no complaints about the service
And I went during restaurant week--while other places this week have treated me like an unwelcome step child and treated me funny for ordering from the rest week menu, butter did not
The Food: AMAZING!! App:arugula salad with warm goat chees, butter croutons, glazed pears
Entree:Gnocci w/pesto, shaved parmesean, portobello mushrooms Dessert:Warm chocolate cake with ice cream
:) And the butterscotch martinie is delicious!!!
Don't waste your time
This place is genuinely terrible
I read the CitySearch reviews and thought, there is no way it can be THAT bad
But, it was!!  I am disguisted at the level of service, the quality of food, the management and the wait time
I just cannot wait until this place goes out of business
Honestly - if you think you can get away with making someone wait to be served for 2 hours after being seated, bring them the wrong meal on the first try, put personal blame on them for taking a few minutes to decide on the order, then slap a 20 percent gratuity on to the final, un-altered, bill - YOU ARE NUTS! This place is by far the WORST NY RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE ever
After all the drama with our experience, the manager proceeded to tell us there was nothing he could do
This place won't last
so don't waste your time
BEWARE: 1/2 of our party was 20 minutes late - stuck in traffic - while the other 2 were there
Mind you, we made the reservation 3 weeks in advance
We watched as they gave away our table - and they told us that it would only be 15 minutes until the next table
The rest of our party showed up and they refused to seat us, and proceeded in giving away the next table to a party of 4 that just walked in- no reservation - as the 4 of us looked on with disbelief
Then he said, sorry - you should have been on time, it will probably be another hour!!! Long story short
we left and had a great meal elsewhere, but I can assure you, I will never eat at Butter
The staff was just RUDE
Don't waste your money on this one!!!
Me and my girlfriend had heard so much about this relatively new and hot spot in NYC
We figured it would be a great place to celabrate our 2 years of happiness together
From the moment we arrived the service from the front was below average
We had to ask to have our jackets taken
We then went to the bar for a drink while our table was being set
It took the bartender a good 5-10 minutes to notice us
FYI-It wasn't even that busy either !! We finially get sat and the hostess who sat us

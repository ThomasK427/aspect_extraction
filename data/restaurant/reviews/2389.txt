Do they clean the water? the food was good - but at those prices is it really exceptional and worth it- NO
After all - how much should you have to pay for relatively ordinary things like chicken or fish which are not prepared in any truly exceptional way
Having grown up dining at The Four Seasons (My first meal there was when I was 12 years old in 1967) I can say that I have a relationship with the place as a fan and many fond memories there
It is truly the best overall dining experience I have ever taken part in
What I love about the place is its elegance, its food and its lack of pretence
Years ago when some doctor tried to bump ahead of me and said I am Dr
so and so the Maitre D said, Your mother must be very proud, and escorted me and my guest to our table
My wife had her first meal there 2 years ago (She is a steely Hong Kong woman) and could only say in response to her meal: WOW! Do not miss the duck! -David Schneider, Hong Kong
We spent a lovely evening of gracious dining in the pool room
The staff anticipated our every need with candor
The food was delicious with an elegant presentation
I had oysters for my appetizer and the Turbot with a delicate creamy lemon sauce with a hint of dill for dinner
The wines are excellent and they make a very good cocktail
It's a great atmosphere for a business deal or a place for a romantic dinner
It is expensive but you get what you pay for
People like to say the Four Seasons Restaurant is all hype
Then again, those are probably mostly bitter, jealous individuals who couldn't get a reservation or a decent table
The Four Seasons continues to shine after all this time
Julian Nicolini is most certainly one of the finest restauranteurs in Manhattan
He deserves all the praise in the world for his ability to make everybody feel like somebody special
The Four Seasons is a fabulous precursor to a big night out at Bungalow, and even better for an important lunch
Try to count the number of business deals and 'friendly agreements' that have been struck around the pool
It's impossible
The list goes on and on
Cheers to the Four Seasons - a reliable, intimate, but also exciting dining experience
This is one place in Manhattan that is most definitely hard to beat
I was thrilled to go and service was fine but we were shuffled past the pool room up into a loft area that was rather drab
The food, overall, was ok but nothing that would make me want to return
The beef wellington was uninspired but I remember the sides being quite good
Great martini's at the bar but overall a disappointment
I am european, for business and pleasure I eat at the best places in the world
The 4 Seasons is always on my mind when I am in New York
The pool room is classy and romantic, superb service, good food, unique ambience
I had one of the best dates in my life
I will keep coming back!
when i first came to this place i was stunned by the beautiful decos
after i tasted the food i knew i was going to come here again
this place is one those places youre gonna want to come back over and over again
Other than the cocktail prices, everything was beyond what I expected
The cocktails weren't any different than the ones from Olive Garden, so I don't think they were worth the prices, but they were delicious nonetheless
The food and service were marvelous and the scene is quite uptown sophisticated
It's a great indulgence if you can't regularly afford such prices (like myself), but worth the splurge at least once in your lifetime to see and experience how the more fortunates live regularly

My wife and I were on our honeymoon recently and enjoyed our dinner at The Four Seasons
Now, I know this is New York and things are a little pricey however, it was worth the extra cash
My wife had the Salmon of which was tasteful and had onderful presentation
I had a wonderful fillet which was cooked quite well
It was not the best filet I have ever had, however it was very good
You could not beat the service and ambience
I have spent my life traveling the world, sampling the finest foods and wines and The Four Seasons is by far the best restaurant I have ever visited
From the moment you walk up the stairs into the Grill Room you know you're in for a treat
This restaurant delivers it all: romance, impeccable surroundings, delicious food, rare and exotic wines and the kind of service you rarely find anywhere
While I have visited The Four Seasons on dozens of occasions for lunch, I was blown away by a dinner I had in the Pool Room recently
My date was so impressed as we were seated poolside for the best romantic meal I have ever experienced
The dashing owner, a charming Italian man, suggested we start with chilled oysters and Taittinger champagne
Wow is all I can say
This restaurant is a must visit for anyone who loves great restaurants
Beyond a prompt if perfunctory seating, there isn't much to good to say
It took much time for anyone to ackowledge our presence
Once drinks were ordered we experienced one of the evening's many long service pauses, the whopper of which occurred between appetizer and main course- 20 min; about the same wait for someone- anyone-to clear plates before desert
As for the wine service, no sommelier to give a hand with the eye-poppingly priced list and noone to pour after the first glassful
The food was workmanlike but singularly uninspired
The cold foie gras appetizer was too cold to allow the dish's flavor to appear
The sauted foie gras' accompaniment- a very pleasant warm pineapple base- was the highlight of the evening
The Chateaubriand was cooked as requested but its bearnaise sauce was bland and the gratin's potatoes underdone
The chocolate souffle was adequate but far from the best
Order the grand marnier souffle
Appetizers and entrees were merely adequate, but you can't beat the pool room for atmosphere
The service was exceptional
Waiters were attentive, charming and never once condescending, even though both my dining companion and I made what we felt to be minor gaffes
Wine list comprehensive but seriously overpriced
Come for a drink and dessert and soak up the atmosphere - the food is nothing much, at least not the crab cakes or the asparagus soup
My Boyfriend took me to the Four Seasons for Valentine's Day Dinner 2 years ago
They certainly live up to their reputation here! We were seated promptly, the service was impeccable
Everything was so delicious! In my opinion, the Four Seasons is worth every penny!
After spending well over $1500, all 10 attendees from our retirement dinner party left extremely disappointed with their meals
Our fish was dry and overcooked, the souflee was hard and cakey, and at dessert time, a ridiculous mound of cotton candy was dropped unceremoniously on our table's center, effectively blocking visual contact with guests sitting across
Furthermore, had it not been for an astute wine afficionado in attendence, an inferior bottle of wine would have been uncorked, consistent with a disturbing and increasingly prevalent scam occuring in New York's fine restaurants
Patrons beware
Don't be suckered
However, if you're just paying for ambience, this is the place
We had the pre-theater dinner at $55 and it was great
Appetiser, entree, dessert coffee
Excellent menu selection
Everything was prepared and served perfectly
Good portions
Very professional staff
I thought the mid-century decor (around 1960) would be dated but it was not
The rooms are spacious and lovely
You do not feel crowded and they don't rush you
You're there for a first rate dinner experience, and that's what you get
We just couldnt be happier
The food was wonderful
I especially love the crispy duck I ordered
Our waiter, Patrick, was the nicest waiter I have ever met
He was very friendly and told us if we werent happy with the food, he can take it back and give us something else
Since my cousin who is 7, also came with us, Patrick asked the kitchen to cut the lamb into bit-size so it would be easier for my cousin to eat
After the dinner, I asked for the chocolate velvet for dessert and Patrick suggested the Chocolate Souffl but gave us both so we could try them all
Plus, we got a plate of dessert samples full of great-decorated tiny cakes chocolate
Patrick also surprised my cousins with two cotton cadies

Forty minutes after THAT, we still hadn't been seated though we could see a lot of large tables available downstairs
We were told that those downstairs tables were reserved (!!!) by the MANAGER (!!!)
Overall, food was pretty good, our server was fun, and it was affordable
But we waited way longer than anyone with a reservation should have (with only attitude provided by management), and it was CRAMPED upstairs
I wouldn't go with a group ever again!
My friend and I ate here last night
The hostess seated us downstairs, which was great 'cause the main floor was chaotic
The food was absolutley wonderful and portions were just enough
Also, the drinks were awesome
My mojito was just right
My only gripe was the delayed service in taking our order
Overall, good dining
I definitely plan to return
i'm cuban from miami and the food at this place has gotten the closest to tasting like back home
in true cuban fashion the portions could be a bit larger
i'm a tough critic, and yea i've been to the other places in the city
it's a good date place, has a good vibe, and the sangria was primo
I was thoroughly impressed by the service and the food at Cuba
I went last Saturday night for dinner with a group of girlfriends and we had a great time
Although a bit small, the live music, food and the bartender added to the great ambience of the restaurant
I recommend the restaurant to anyone who wants to have good Latin/Cuban cuisine and a great coconut mojito!!!
DON'T BOTHER MAKING A RESERVATION THEY DO NOT HONOR THEM
I MADE A RESERVATION FOR MY BIRTHDAY FOR 14 PEOPLE
WHEN I ARRIVED THE RUDE HOSTESS GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND FOR THE FIRST 15 MINUTES THEN SHE GOT COMPLETELY RUDE AND SIMPLY IGNORED ME
NOTHING WAS READY AND THE MANAGER WAS DIFFICULT TO GET A HOLD OF AND WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH MY COMPLAINT
THE SERVICE IS SLOW AND THE FOOD HAD NO TASTE
I EAT A LOT OF CUBAN CUISINE AND WAS UTTERLY DISSAPPOINTED AND RECOMMEND THAT YOU RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
After booking a birdthday party reservation we were ushered to our table, which turned out to be a mistake, were told we couldn't sit anywhere until our whole party arrived
After asking to speak to the manager (hostess was extremely rude) he continued to be rude and suggest that we were late so therefore they gave our tabke away
We were on time if not early
they had us waiting at the bar for 45 minutes and refused to olet us sit at an open table
Besides the waitstaff being rude the manager was even worse
We left the place without dinning there
Who would want to dine at place with such a rude staff? It was really un-called for and such a shame
We told all our friends about it and none of them will be dining there
If you want to have a bad time i suggeest Cuba!
I went to Cubathe last weekend and I have the mos wonderfull time in NY, the ambiance was great, the food was really good , It was the best cuban food that I ever tried in NYC
The appetizers were perfect, the mojito has a great taste
All the people smile all the time and really I enjoyed be there
I really recomend this place
Worst experience ever in Cuba
It was a friends birthday and in hearing all the great reviews we booked a reservation for a party of 10
When the the first of us arrived we were quickly ushered to our table
10 minutes later when a few more people arrived we were told that we needed to get get up that we were given the wrong table
They did not have another table ready for us and didn't know how long the wait would be
The hostess was extremely rude and the manager even more so
Instead of offering his apologogies he proceeded to be rude to us and told us they had given our table away since we were 40 minutes late
We were on time if not earlier and were not being allowed seating 45 minutes after our reservation
I will not reccomend this place to any one
You can't beat the value of this place
The sushi is excellent and the prices couldn't be lower and i've been there numerous times
This is a great place to take friends -- the Hana Boat is perfect for 4 people (combo of sushi, sashimi, and maki, brought to the table in a big wooden boat platter)
The fish here is fresh and tasty, and the service is prompt and polite
My wife and I have been going here over the past year on a regular basis anytime we are ready to eat
The sushi is brilliant and with the unlimited option, you never go away hungry
Very friendly service and because it's on the fringe of restaurant central on Smith street, rarely crowded
This place is good as far as the food goes and the staff has always been great to us
The BEST part?? They deliver and have their full menu on their website which is awesome and totally rocks when you don't feel like cooking
Pop Diner took over the old Sage Diner space
Sage had gone downhill, and was a sorry place to have a breakfast
The new owners tore it up, renovated into space age '60's orange and black psychedelia
Think if the Jetson's ate at a diner
They renovated the menu as well
All the diner staples are there - great eggs, waffles, pancakes, burgers, etc
But they've added a neighborhood spin - Asian style dishes, Latin dishes, and inventive specials
Great food, decent prices, wacky drinks
Everytime I go in they remember me, like an episode of Cheers
Not your father's diner anymore!
I asked for a veggie mushroom wrap without cheese
The waiter then brought the wrap and it included cheese
He brought it back without the cheese and when I looked inside I realized there was chicken inside
He brought it back again with mostly no cheese but there was still one piece inside
When he brought the bill I gave my credit card and 20 minutes passed and he never came to pick it
At the time the diner was relatively empty and waiters were milling about talking with each other
I complained to the cashier although and she was kind enough to take my meal off the bill
The ambience was pretty good but I would have to say that this diner is not ready for prime time
great people and food it is spotless parking is ample and it is within walking of 2 subway lines
This is the best diner I have ever eaten in
The food is great, the workers are very friendly
The manager greats us when we come in and stops by the table to see if everything is ok
I HIGHLY recommend you try this diner
The way this diner is designed, makes you feel like your hip/ up to date with the new style
it is so modern unlike the other diners I've been too
I Just LOVE IT
A great retro styled diner, with a staff that is courteous, prompt and sometimes the may even read your mind as far as what you would like
Unbelievable! Thats all that needs to be said
This is not your avreage diner, From the amazing dishes to the creamy cheese cake
Love the selections  of different cuisines, from the Asian, Latin, to just simple American,  the POP has it
Service was promt Ivette (the manager) was the best, this  is the place to be! If your looking for something different, this  is it
highly reccommemded
I was recently in this diner for the first time and i have to tell you, i am now a life member
The atmosphere was warm, with a home-like feeling, and the service was second to none
My server was so thoughgtful, and invited me back again to see her
It was truly a wonderful evening out
Pop gives new meaning to the word Diner
Great flavor and a comfortable atmosphere
The traditional food has been given a kickstart
I will definately be going back for a second visit
I happened to go to Pop diner haphazardly
I was travelling close by and saw this very unique 70s looking eatery

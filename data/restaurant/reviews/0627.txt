Our friend had the grilled dorade and felt it was too boney (obviously not restaurant's fault - stupid fish)
I wasn't a huge fan of the sardine appetizer
too fishy
Overall great experience for the price (entrees hovered around ~$19)
Definitely recommended, but make reservations in advance or good luck!
Very nice place, looked it up on CitySearch and went there after shopping with the wife one night
She loves seafood, while I'm it's not always my favorite but I really loved what I got
One thing you should know is there is not land lubber section
You better like seafood to some degree before going
But other than that, incredible food
High recommended
I enjoyed my meal here, it's not great but it is ok
I had the whole fish which was tasty and good, the oysters weren't as fresh as the waitress said it was
The Lobster roll was very average, tastes much like everywhere else but on a round burger bun (brioche?) rather than a hotdog bun
the complimentarout half inch thick, they shouldn't ey pudding had a skin about a half inch thick, they shouldn't have even offered it
Overall decent for a place that's just seemed to be churning and burning table turns
An otherwise good meal had a bad ending
After our entree, the waitress brought us 2 espresso cups that looked like they were filled with mousse and whipped cream
I said, oh, no, that's not for us thinking she'd broght them to the wrong table
She whisked them away, almost in a temper, and set them aside, but they weren't served to anyone else
When she brought the check I asked if the dessert was meant for us
Yes, she said, it's complementary
Hey, Lady, we're not mindreaders
Mad because you have to wait tables?! GET OVER IT!
Me and my boyfriend went there last Friday 'coz we read how great the restaurant was on citysearch
We ordered a shrip scampi, which was the Friday special, as a starter
it was good, but too much oil
I had a whole grilled dorade as the main course
again
it was way too greasy
and this time i could feel the greae in my throat after eating
It's not worth it consider we paid almost $90 for a starter and two main courses
But it's recommended to go without a high expectation
I went in with a couple of girl friends a while ago, not entirely knowing what to expect, my friend chose the place
It turned out to be great! Our waiter Chad was adorable, I haven't had a staff nearly as friendly in a while
We followed his recomendations blindly and didn't regret it one bit
The lobster roll is great and the mahi mahi with the cold vegetables is so tasty to be so light
And even though I was stuffed I couldn't deny the chocolate pudding
Thanks to Chad and the mermaid inn for giving us a good night
Been there several times and hope to return soon
Of 5-6 meals, have only one complaint -- on one visit, one lobster roll did not taste quite right, but, otherwise, the food is excellant
Affordable white wine list
I would not let on mediocre experience stop me from recommending this place highly
Ask to be seated up front
An excellent destination for those looking for high quality, creative seafood, without the pretension of some other local fish houses
Wait-staff is knowledgeable and attentive, and is not afraid to make a recommendation
Last time I was there, I had mahi-mahi that was as flavorful as I've ever experienced
Overall, a great spot!
Just a warning parking was not easy
We had got there and we had to wait for a table - went to the bar and had drinks which were pretty good
The only con was the seating in which was a bench style with tables and chairs on the outside that were VERY close to each other
The food was excellent
Definitely recommend the west coast oysters and the rock shrimp balls w/ spicy sauce were ok
The lobster roll and fries w/ vingear were outstanding and so was the shrimp,scallops in the spagetti
Had a nice bottle of wine (german/austrian) name we couldn't pronounce
No dessert menu just a small complimentary chocolate mouse which was fine by me considering we ate so much
Overall great place and can't wait to go back and sit outside in the garden when the weather gets nicer!
The service is excellent: friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient
In a city largely lacking good service outside of high-end restaurants, this is noticeable in and of itself
The food is solid
Wine list is solid
Atmosphere is lively and has an out-of-the-city feeling
Fun and relaxing place to go
Overall, a good restaurant - nice atmosphere (a little more West Village than East Village), solid menu, prompt seating and fairly priced
What keeps it from being great? Service was friendly, but the food was poorly paced; waited 45 for raw bar/apps, then entree came too soon
Also, the wine list was moderately priced, but the selections seemed a bit limited (focus on some more obscure Australians)
Was there on a Friday night and there were no specials, or at least we weren't told about them
Finally, there was no dessert menu
Everyone was given a complementary pudding, but no explanation as to why no dessert (menupages has a dessert menu for this restaurant)
Anyway, an overall nice place and especially good if you want to take out your parents in the East Village
I recently dined there with a group of 5 and I must say, they lived up to their impressive reviews
Our party of 5 was seated immediately
The service was impeccable! The waitstaff was so friendly and accomodating
But most importantly, the food was delicious
To everyone's surprise, the iceberg lettuce w/ blue cheese appetizer was very tasty
Most of us had the spaghetti with salad on top entree which was one of the best meals I've had in ages
And the cod was a huge hit too
We would have preferred more recognizable California wines on the list, but who cares?! I can't wait to go back and try the lobster sandwich that everyone raves about
I just hope they maintain their high standards - what a pleasure!
This is the spot to go if you are a seafood lover
They have exotic seafood such as skate which is cooked to perfection
If they can get that right I think everything else on the menu is bound to be great
I had the Mahi Mahi which was very good as well
Reasonably priced go here for some truly delicious seafood entrees
Though on the zagat they talk about their no-rezzie policy at this village seafood shack that gets quickly overcrowded in the front
I was easily able to snag a reservation for dinner on a Wed
night to taste one of the best fish plates I had in a while
I ordered the sea scallops for appetizer and the skate for my entree
WOW
The skate was juicy and meaty and went perfect with the corn/red onion relish that its served with
The stuffed dorade also had an excellent citrus/savory flavor to it
and the lobster sandwich though small in size had real big chunks of tasty lobster bits and came with a side of their specialty old bay fries! Overall I truly enjoyed this restaurant and do plan to go back whenever I crave some good but simple seafood
It can get a bit crowded here
We asked for the fried oysters they told us they no longer have that on the menu
They said it might come back later on
Otherwise, the lobster sandwich was delicious
My gf tried it was so jealous! Great food, a little small, but still a great place to go to
I went to Mermaid Inn recently and was quite surprised what this little restaurant had to offer
Although it's not the largest menu I've ever seen, the items they do have are excellent
So many tasty things to choose from it was hard to decide

I went in here on a whim, originally, but after I became a convert, I discovered other Slopers knew about this pizza temple, too--though I've never heard anyone mention it outside Brooklyn
But hey, Brooklyn knows pizza
I went to tai pan to get 4 swiss roll cake and some  bread
I am taking the cakes on a plane to give away to other people  and you guys are so cheap that you wouldn't give boxes for the cake when  i spend $29
00
My uncle were nagging that it doesn't look good as gift  without the boxes
If it weren't that my aunt keep insisting to take it  I would have left without buying anything
Tai pan is not the only  bakery around
I have plenty of choices
I am very unsatisfy with your  cheap services
I will never go back to Tai Pan (the prices in drinks  and cake are higher than other bakery) and CHEAP services
I have been to this place several times now and I was happy every time
The Kalbi is very good (they use real charcoal) but the soups are also very good
I really like the fact that this place has pretty quick service, even with a group of 13 people
I found the soups and broths pretty good and they give a fair amount of side dishes
This is not exotic cuisine, but traditional food
If you are expecting Korean fusion, go to Manhattan
This is down to earth Korean food and reasonable Queens' prices
I had a great lunch here for Christmas
The food is amazing, the service fast and curteous
Loved it!!!
The service was extremely attentive and top-notch
The flavors of the kalbi we had cooked on the grill in our table
deep and succulent
All the appetizers that came with it were a delight
I loved it loved it loved it!
food here is great
wide selection of korean foods plus sushi and sashimi which is always good
Terrible experience
The pho broth was bland, and extra onions cost $1
50
What was most outrageous was a fiasco involving, che ba mau (a 3-bean drink)
Apparently they ran out of yellow beans, and decided to use corn instead
Of course it tasted nothing like it was supposed to
The waiters insisted corn was supposed to be in it, but when they looked at the menu, there was no mention of corn
The waiters never came back
The manager also refused to remove the drink from the check, suggesting that if we didnt like it, we could simply remove the corn ourselves
Do not eat here
Like the title says this place has awesome dumplings
Heck even if they had awful service and atmosphere I would still come to this place for their dumplings, luckly that is not the case
While they might be famous for their soup dumplings make sure not to overlook the rest of their menu, I love their crispy pan fried noodles
Though the service is speedy be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for the soup dumplings
Nice airy surroundings and a very affordably priced menu
When you arrive at Joe's Shanghai at dinnertime on a weekend night be prepared for a massive throng of pushing and shoving suburbanites waiting, crushed as though they're on a rush-hour subway, in the cramped waiting area at the front of the restaurant
If you can deal with this test of patience, or better yet, if you can avoid the prime-time hours, you will enjoy the amazing soup-filled dumplings here
These are the main attractions
The other food isn't as spectacular, but still rates
The often unbearable crowds at Joe's now reminds us of Yogi's still-fresh aphorism: Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded
My friends and I went to the one in Flushing on 37th and we had a pleasant experience
The service was excellent
We had siao long bao - mini steamed buns - which is supposedly very tasty from this establishment
It wasn't bad, but it can be a bit too oily when they cooled down
I have to say that the scallion pancakes here is one of the best I've tasted
Chinese people in NY know where to go when they want to eat steamed pork buns: Joe's Shanghai
There are several restaurants in the Joe's Shanghai chain, and the one in Flushing is average compared to the rest
The best Joe's is the one in the Manhattan Chinatown, but if you go there on a weekend evening, be prepared for a long wait
People come to Joe's Shanghai for its steamed soupy buns, but there is also a long menu for other chinese dishes that you would expect
If you eat here, order the steamed buns with crab filling
They cost more than the plain pork buns, but they are worth it! When you eat the buns, hold it up with your spoon, not chopsticks
When you bite into it, beware of the steaming hot juices inside
enjoy!
I loved the food and the service was great
Had my daughter's graduation celebration there
The grilled meats were great
Crab legs were wonderful
Great selection on the buffet
Killer martinis and great desserts
I had a great time
Great for large groups
Only problem is that you pay extra for soft drinks and this should be included in the buffet price
It was wonderful
A jewel in Flushing
Just had a birthday dinner here and it was the worst experience ever!They sat us at a table that smelled really bad
We brought a ice cream cake and asked them to put it in the freezer
When the waiter came out with it, it was all melted
The waiter said it had not been put in the freezer, found it on the counter
We talked to the manager, his excuse was the employees are very busy
He told us he would give us a cake, but ended up on our bill! To top it off, we only had 13 ppl,but they charged for 2 more b/c 2 stopped by to say happy bday
When we tried to argue, he wouldnt let us get our cars which were in valet
O, and the food was pretty bad! The valet ppl told us this happens everyday!! We will never go back there again!
Went there with my fiance the other night for the first time
We both enjoyed dinner very much, and I thought the food was better than at Greenfield's
There was live music but it got a little loud at times
Still, for a fun time Master Grill is hard to beat!
My boyfriend and I had wanted to try this place for a while but were never able to find it, so we gave up - then one day, on a totally unrelated errand, we spotted it from the highway and we went it on the spur of the moment
The place is rather large and imposing, the decor borders on tacky, but the meats are good and the hot buffet/salad bar items were tasty and of good quality
My boyfriend proclaimed the meatballs as being the best he has ever had
Bring a large appetite!
Master Grill is the perfect place for dining
It has a large salad bar, many side dishes, soups, fruits, bread, crab legs and sushi
yes I said SUSHI
My boyfriend will take me just so he can get his fill on sushi
There are a variety of meats which will circle the tables
beef, steaks, chicken, pork, deer, rabbit
you name it and they have it
Even the pickiest of eaters can't be disappointed
On weekends they have entertainment and there is also a room available for parties which is always taken on weekends
Desert is extra but I doubt you'd have room after getting your fill of their ample variety of food
The waitstaff is helpful and they'll get your favorite meats to circle your table more often if you just ask
The restaurant also has a nice decor

The pastas with tomato sauce are okay, but the pastas with olive oil are so DRENCHED in oil and butter i felt like i was choking
They really mess up a simple dish like spagetti a la vongole which is supposed to be light
I went to Celeste knowing it was going to be good, but I was absolutely bowled over by everything from the food to Carmine himself
The warmth and ease was the perfect complement to the stunning food (try the fried artichoke!) and the perfect pizza, finished off by a delectably perfect (and smuggled!) cheese plate
Trust Carmine with your entire meal and you won't be sorry
The food is relatively good for what you pay
The place is crowded and they have a rude and annoying policy of bringing you the check along with the cheese, hoping that you clear the table as soon as possible
If you order a desert or coffee after the cheese, they will tell you it's not possible since they have already brought you the check
When you say you didn't ask for the check, they speak with the owner, and say that this time they are going to make an exception, however, you must eat fast since there are people waiting! The food is not worth this treatment! You are better off somewhere else
I am certainly not going back!
Love the well-priced authentic food here
Excellent cheese plates too
Wish the space were less cramped but I suppose that is the trade-off for keeping the prices so low
I have been to Celeste several times, and always take my friends here from out of town for a NY local restaurant
You must order the cheese plate! Carmine comes around and tells you in detail about the cheese, the origin, the flavors to expect
The specials are always good, but if you order off the menu, I like the raviolis or the shrimp pasta
Yummy! And yes, it's worth the wait!
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance
Service is very good
Owner is pleasant and entertaining
Ask about the history
Give it a try, menu is typical French but varied
Although I heard that Cho Dang Gol was very delcious from many people, I was a little bit skeptical
But
after i ate the food, especially the soon doo boo chigae, i believe it
The food is excelellent
I would definitely go back
The waitstaff was also very helpful and friendly
I ate there several times
The kimchi is excellent
The menu is very limited for a single diner as most of the menu is dedicated to dishes for two
The service was attentive and the prices were average
Chodanggol is weird- some dishes are excellent beyond belief and other dishes are really just WTF??? I would recommend kongbiji, bussut sotbot (mushroom and beef with rice), and doobu daenjang chigae
The service is mediocre- not much attention is paid to a customer even if you are a big korean family with elders at the table
They are really busy during prime lunchtime and dinner time
went to this place, instead of the usual standby around the corner, based on review I read here which touted the homemade tofu that came with the abundant comlpimentary appetizers
We wree told they were out of tofu tonight, unless you pay for it and were served deep fried zucchini and onions instead
We then ordered the sirloin BBQ and chicken BBQ
The beef was acceptable, but the chicken was disgusting -- fatty, grizzle dark meat
It was not edible
The came by 1/2 hour later and when she saw that the chicken was not touched, she simply asked Are you done with this? and took it away
No inquiry as to why it was not eaten - she probably knew why
Some concise advice - don't go here
There are many other place that are far superior, including 36 Bar BBQ, Kang Suh or Yakiniku JuJu
This resturant's specialty is the hand made tofu
I would say that this place is preferred from the ones in 34th street because they offer more and better side dishes(ban chan) than other k-town resturants
Their pancakes are really good but their main dishes are average
Is to die for! Food is clean, and staffs are friendly
It is a overall good experience for Korean food
I just really love their bulgogi and bibimbop (forgive me for spelling if it's wrong)
The tofu dishes and soups are a must-try as well
I like the fact that I don't come out of the restaurant smelling like Korean BBQ
I also enjoy their after-dinner ginger-lemon tea concoction that goes down really smooth and satisfying
I been to Han Bat next door a couple times before trying this place and personally, it's better
The atmosphere is more appealing and the food is very good and quite plentiful
No need to order an appetizer, the wait staff bring the goods right to your table after ordering
Great kim chi and other Korean munchies
The menu consists of dishes mostly made from to-fu
Don't be fooled by the high priced appetizers, they're huge! Tremenndous, filling Korean pancakes
I highly recommend this place
The Scene Diners sit elbow-to-elbow at paper-draped tables, sipping from wine glasses and straining to speak over high-decibel mood music that bounces between the brick walls
Ill-informed servers are often rushed, and parties are rarely served at the same time
The Food Fans of Nam may experience deja vu--the menu's virtually the same here, and the creative, casual Vietnamese dishes are attracting crowds
Start with cucumber and cilantro stuffed tuna rolls, sizzling wok-seared sirloin and watercress salad or monkfish with peanuts, mint and peppers
Soups, such as creamy pumpkin curry or fish broth with shrimp dumplings, are excellent
Both the chili-lime glazed snapper and steamed bass over ginger-scallion noodles are reliably good
Some familiar dishes, such as chili-lemongrass chicken and roast duck, are humdrum
Creamy chocolate mousse with orange marmalade, and chilled coconut cream topped with tapioca sauce are nice finishes
I visited 3/20 - I thought the service was quite good
There were many helpful people, not only one waiter - kept refilling the water, the wine, asking if everything was okay
The food was fresh, clean and reasonably priced
The duck was hard to eat with chopsticks, but I suppose that's my problem
Spring rolls were good, and the mousse for dessert was great too
This is a great low-key neighborhood spot, allowing you to avoid the overdone Eighth Ave
scene and the too-hip Meatpacking district to the south
This could be my new favorite place
My partner and I wandered into Omai for the first time last night, Jan
8th
We arrived at 6:30pm without reseverations
We received a cold reception from the host and considered walking out, but decided to give it a shot
Our waiter was attentive and friendly
The food was quite reasonably priced for the high quality
We started with the seared tuna spring rolls, simple and wonderful, then had the delicious shrimp and pork ribs with a carmelized onion-pepper sauce, and a seafood soup with a fragrant and tasty coconut broth
We had an inexpensive 2003 Fleur du Cap chardonnay which was light and perfectly accompanied our dishes
The ambience is warm, with soft lighting and brick walls
Quiet enough to enjoy conversation with your companion
I will go back to Omai again soon, and hope that next time there is a friendlier host
It was funny reading all the negative reviews, but in their defense-here goes
The food is great! In one word clean, the food tastes clean to me (not heavy or unhealthy)
Lots of starters that you can make a whole meal of
Very vegetarian friendly menu too
It is crowded and the host can be a little difficult at times, but hello people-It's New York!  I had my birthday dinner there also for 20 guests and they took very good care of us
I eat here reg
and find it consistently good
I went here at 8:25 on Tuesday night, meeting 3 others
I didn't expect the place to look swanky, and once I peeked in the window, didn't expect to get a table for 4 with no reservation at 8:30! I went in, was greeted immediately and was told that it would be no problem for us to be seated right away- and I was the only one there! Atmosphere is gorgeous - brick walls, candle-lit, cozy tables
The menu was reasonable priced $11-$18 for entrees, $11-$16 for noodles/soups, around $8 for appetizers
I had the seared tuna roll appetizer (yummy and spicy) and lemongrass beef vermicilli noodles w/ peanuts
Good Vietnamese beer
Waiter service was great

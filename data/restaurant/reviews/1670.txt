(Yea, right) ;)
Always an on-the-go treat between classes or late nights
I've heard many people declare it a favorite
Even if you're not a student, it's worth the stop
Try the tomato and garlic--with and an altoid
I am a big pizza lover, and I have tried many places out
I have been eating at this restaurant for approximately 4 years, and I prefer not to go to other pizza places anymore either
Most New York pizza tends to fall apart on you when you're eating it
Their pizza not only stays firm, but it has a great taste also
I have never consumed pizza that taste this much like cardboard
The cheese literally has no taste, the crust was pale and dry, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a jar of generic tomato sauce sweetened with some kind of generic sugar substitute
And the funny thing is,
I'm not a pizza snob by any means
My co-worker warned me
He told me to go to the shop all the way down on 2nd Ave
, but it was cold and somehow Georgio's got an 8
9 rating
Do not be fooled by misled CitySearchers who could even fathom giving this pizza anymore than a rating of 3 - and that is generous
If it came down to it
I would rather spend my money and timing savoring street meat than ever have to revisit this truly disappointing experience
I love pizza in New York, where even the mediocre pizza is worth your time and money
The sauce here is too sweet and the crust perhaps a little too thin
Giorgio's was not fantastic, but it hit the spot
Perfect when you're going to a show at Irving Plaza
This place is great- right next to Union Square
They drop sauce at random over the whole pie; at first glance, you think it's pepperoni
Definitely not authentic Italian eats, but really good!
I have been going to rays for a couple of months now since i live in the area
Two things have happened in that short time, 1) prices of the pizza have risen twice 2) selection has been reduced in most cases
Sure service is fast, and the slices are pretty good, but how fast does pizza inflation rise? I find the best deal is in the sicilian slice
When I say selection has reduced, i mean selection of single toping pizzas; its almost as if they want you to spend more on the more expensive slices
Good luck trying to find just a chicken slice, its gotta be chicken bacon, chicken broccoli, or chicken sausage if you want chicken
variety is good, but not when it my only, more expensive, choice
more than just pizza, but who looks past the Sicilian?
There's nothing better than this fast paced counter with great pizza choices
You'll have yours in under two minutes then sit outside and watch the characters go by
No kids running around either which is great
Wave to the tour busses and sit as long as you want for this is the corner where history was made
You can almost hear the past! Then go around the corner for great ice cream, falafels, a little bit of Tibet and great shoes
If you're not a character then stay away
Worst service ever especially people behind the pizza counter
They act like as if they are giving us a free food
They remind me of Seinfeld's soup nazi guy
They refused to sell me a coffee because I have a stroller with me and it seems to take much of their precious space
MCP (male chauvinism p)
I will walk miles to get a coffee then set a foot in that restaurant again
In a city that is renowned for it's slice, it's amazing how many places get away with selling bad pizza
I've tried a lot of them, and I always come back to this place because I know it's consistently good
Their pizza has a good crust (crunchy/crispy but not dry or hard), tasty sauce, and the right amount of cheese
It's not gourmet pizza, and the place is certainly not fancy (not the place to take a date) but it is the best place when you want a quick slice that is good and cheap
You can get two plain slices and a coke for $3
50! I have definitely spent more money on worse pizza that is tasteless or has a soft crust (the worst!)
I just ordered the eggplant parmagiana hero and I can't BELIEVE how bad it is
The bread is stale and the eggplant tough
HELLO? Tough eggplant??? The sauce is lousy - way too sweet - and the cheese is scary
I can't believe I had to wait 20 minutes for this either
I am starving and my cat's food is looking a lot better than this
STAY AWAY
As a poor NYU student, I was curious about the Dean and Deluca around the corner
I've been to their store on Broadway and was extremely impressed
However, the cafe was not up to par
The raspberry chocolate cheesecake i had was dry and seemed a day old and my friend's $5, 3 inch diameter torte was disgusting
True, we went late, around 7, as an after dinner treat, but were sorely dissaponted
i am constantly dissappointed by the service at this DD
i feel like people are hired without taking into consideration the fact that they have no willingness to serve anyone
I go there midafternoon for coffee and am consistently welcomed by sour employees who seem to loathe their jobs and the customers
i go for the food and coffee and leave with $20 less and a frown on my face
They don't master their coffee, and the place is anything but a coffeehouse
It is more deli meets convenience store, with an espresso machine
The atmosphere needs help, and $3 for an americano that tasted mediocre, if that, is outrageous
The coffee and food are wonderful; the cafe is cute and best of all, that new manager is 4'10 of pure adorableness!
This is a cute little place, very laid back, and good coffee! And, I agree, the new manager is quite cute, and very friendly
this is a really great place to sit and read or have coffee with friends
the added bonus is the new manager who is incredibly cute
I like this place One of my favorite in Manhattan Very good service (so quick!:) Very good food)))
I eat here almost everyday and find both the food and service excellent
I would recommend this place to everyone
I happened to be a customer of this caf since grand opening and witnessed its evolution from coffee-snack bar to all-day-great-food for any taste restaurant
The main item of the impressive choice from the menu is coffee
House blend made this place a Mecca for coffee- lovers in the area overrun with Starbucks
You won't find other food biseness in Midtown where You can have breakfast, lunch and dinner for less than $20 with this food quality
I have tried this place several times, convinced that I must have just had a fluke mediocre experience (particularly after all of the rave reviews)
Alas, my end conclusion is that no, it just isn't that fantastic
The salad was fine but nothing special, pancakes are fine but nothing special (Clinton Street's are muuuuuuuuuuuch better), and the Chicken and Pesto wrap and Minestrone soup I got were both pretty good, but their smoothies are bland and fairly tasteless
They do have good gelato though
I guess it's a good deal for the money, as it is QUITE cheap, but again, you get what you pay for I suppose
this is the first time i've felt compelled to write a review on a restaurant but i had a terrible experience here a few weeks ago
i went in to order a meal to go and then proceeded to wait
i even chatted on the phone for awhile to pass time
after about 20 mins, i asked the worker how much longer it would take and he said, soon
after another 10 mins, i asked again (i had only ordered a tuna melt, it really should not take that long to make)
he again tried to make an excuse but i asked for my money back b/c i felt i waited too long
the other worker then told me that they were short on staff that night and the cook actually left to make a delivery! so the entire time i was waiting, the cook was gone and they did not even start making my food! i asked the first worker why he did not inform me about this the first time i asked him about my food and he argued with me for a bit
eventually, he gave me my money back but that was a struggle as well
This is a great place! We probably eat here 3-4 times a week
The breakfast is great, and you get a fish-bowl of strong, rich and delicious coffee just for 2
00$
The desserts are yummy
and the homemade scones are to absolutely die for
A great choice of soups

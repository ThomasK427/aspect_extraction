The only negative for the evening was the hostess
I had a reservation, she had major attitude, but hey, it's New York! I will definitely go back
Great ambience
Good service
Menu is a little lame though
And I spent $18 for a tiny little caesar salad! Lameeee
Could have gone to Pastis for a salad three times the size for the same price
Had a very enjoyable time here with my family
The service was prompt and courteous and the food was good
We went during a busy sunday brunch serving, got seated immediately and were treated with the best service by everyone from the hostess to the waiter
The brunch meal was outstanding as well
Highly recommended
Went here with a group of friends
We ordered the oysters, house salad and the tomato salad
We also ordered tuna steak, lobster, short rib, and the NY strip steak
We sampled everything between the 5 of us
The food was average
Our waiter was somewhat not very attentive perhaps we were there late, around 10pm
My boyfriend and I both wanted chateaubriand and decided to go here instead of Megu for their kobe beef version
Well it was a great choice as this completely trumped Megu's not only in overall quality and taste but value (Megu's has a $180 pricetag while Sascha's is $70)
The only place that comes close to it is The Oak Room in Boston
The foie gras appetizer special was also delicious
I hope they make it a permanent fixture on the menu as it was possibly one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted
The drinks were also very good and went well with the old timey feel the whole place had
I will definitely be going back in the very near future
SASCHA may be the New York's epicenter for fine dining on comfort food
Our Dungeness Crab was excellent
The rack of lamb was prepared perfectly
the tuna was black and blue, just as ordered
The ambience in the upstairs dining room was wonderful; elegant,comfortable and we could actually hear each other
We had no room for desert, so came back a few days later for the burgers about which we heard so much, and the hot fudge sundaes
Both were arguably among the best in the city
SASCHA is both a feast for the eye and stomach!!
I have dined twice in the dining room at Sascha, the first time I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience, the food and the service
The second time however left me sadly disappointed
The problem, the unprofessional and blatantly rude somelier
Long story short, we waited some 45 mintues before receiving a drop of wine for a table of 5 (including international guests) and during that time, encountered some of the foulest and most arrogant service it has been my displeasure to experience (setting a new standard even for the meatpacking district!)
To Sascha Lyon, your food is excellent - perhaps you need to turn your attentions to the front of house - your somelier truly does you a dis-service!
One beautiful Friday evening, my friend and I decided to try this newcomer to the neighborhood
After being seated at an outdoor table on a 45 degree tilt, the surly waitress gave us menus
We asked if we could  change tables since everything was sliding off, we were told NO
We ordered drinks
The waitress asked us if we'd be eating dinner
We said we'd like to drink and think about the menu
Then,the miserable hostess came to us and said, My waitress tells me you're not eating here
is this true? Sounded more like a police interrogation
We said we intended to eat
After looking at the Pastis-styled menu knock-off, and seeing nothing that made sense, we asked for our check
Oh
remember the 45 degree angle table? Well, we also had to ask for extra napkings to barricade the water glasses so they wouldn't slide off the table!
Take it from me - I eat out 7 days a week
Dating a food critic
This place is a joke
we got there and they told us we did not have a reservation - which we did
Horribly rude until they found out about the food critic part
The maitre d or whatever he is is the most unprofessional person i have come across in this city
Not snobby - just dumb
Food was not worthwhile and not worth mentioning
Read their review in Time Out and you wont waste your $$$
came with a group a 4 we had a awesome meal
fun place great music too!
This place is a joke
SSSSOOO much hype
I got my dinner before my cocktail
Enough said
Meatpacking must have more mediocre restaurants than anywhere save Little Italy
This oddly sized 2-story joint seems at home on Gansevoort but lacked energy, even though it was full
The menu was uninteresting and unadventurous, so we only ordered a few dishes
The food itself ranged from mediocre to terrible - the Dungeness Crab Saute was overpriced, flavorless and really a disgrace
The smoked fish platter had undercooked potatoes on it and slightly rubbery fish
The aphrodisiac cocktail was ridiculously small for $12 and completely misguided
We sent it back
We heard raves about the blueberry pie, which was mediocre
And the waitress upsold us on ice cream - asking which flavor we wanted with it as if it were included
$10
50 total for a piece of pie! I wonder if the previous reviews (including the first before it opened) are plants or just clueless Pastis patrons
I stopped in for dinner on a whim with my boyfriend the other night and we've gone back twice in a week and a half
We tried the burgers (amazing), the trout, the salmon, and a few appetizers, including the smoked fish platter and found everything to be so delicious
The prices are great too
We love the kind of place that has a great ambiance and crowd but that you can still hear eachother to have conversation, and this is it
Granted, we've only gone on weeknights so far, but we were seated right away and the service was impeccable
This is a romantic restaurant with delicious food
We're going back this weekend with friends
Had dinner here the other night with family
Everyone loved their food the decorations are great as are the use of the exposed brick making you feel like you are in the old meat market
Specifically liked the tuna, shrimp appetizer, and whatever u do save room for dessert
From the time you sit down
to the time you leave
You are enjoying great food, in a lively ambience
The Fried Oyster appetizer was fresh, plump, succulent mouthfuls cooked to perfection
The quality of Raw Oysters are unsurpassed in the Metro area
The Brook Trout w/ Shrimp was pan sauteed to perfection
I was in heaven from the first bite of Short Rib to the last
Out of an extensive dessert menu, my wife and I chose two simple desserts reminiscent of our childhoods, Root Beer Float and a Charlotte Russe
We enjoyed every drop
Sascha's although not open public yet, is already on the road to success
Chef Sascha Lyon food impresses the crowd with his distinct style and AMAZING flavors! Just wait for the grand opening
Start calling now because reservations will soon be impossible
a group of us went there based on Citysearch recommendations
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I got the sashimi platter, which sounded great on the menu

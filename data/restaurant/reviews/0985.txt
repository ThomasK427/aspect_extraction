Excellent food selection, outstanding service, and a great setting
Check out the fondue on the dessert menu - that's alone worth coming back for
My only qualm was that the bar doesn't have Tanqueray 10 (or Tanqueray - only Bombay)
Living in NYC there are plenty of places to go eat and drink, but as far as I am concerned there is no place I could recommend more than One
If you like great food and cute guys go and try the lobster melt, duck spring rolls and check out the guys
I know I'll be back again and again, especially now that spring is here
When you go to One you have to have a certain attitude
At this place you experience a relaxing dining experience
The service might be a little slow at times but it's mainly there so you can enjoy your meal and the company of your friends
Drinks, for me, were always refilled immidietly
The food is absolutely delicious, the people are beautiful, the staff is attentive and very relaxed
I would recommend making reservations and after a certain hour there place turns into a social hot spot in the Meatpacking
I went here a few weeks ago with two other friends
The food was delicious and cocktails were great
The service was good too
The hostess was very accomodating and bought us a round of drinks since we had to wait even though we had reservations
Definitely worth the trip!
After hearing my friends rave about this place, I must say
we had the best time
Everyone was so friendly
We met the owners of the restaurant and they were great
Service was remarkable
Food was delicious
We ordered the duck spring roll, calamari, oysters, hanger steak, and duck canelloni (my favorite)
I'm coming back for the duck canelloni
We ended up staying for the night for bottle service too
Bottle Service is totally recommended
Your drink is at your fingertips and you don't have to wait for the waitress to come back with your cocktail
I will definitely keep coming back
Went here last night the day after V-day, so we got right in and seated
The service was great and the Manager himself came over to our table to make sure that everything was ok and he even reccommended a wine for us
Great time all around
I heard they got a new chef, so I tried it out for Valentine's Day
The food was good, not too overpriced, the lounge was awesome, and I loved the atmosphere
I have a friend coming to town and already made reservations to go back
Great date place too
I was impressed with the wine list, plus they had all different kinds of wine within all price ranges
Our waiter was very helpful in food and wine selection
I highly recommend
Every food item was delicious
Contrary to my belief, I heard the food was great, and that i had to try out the new food
so I did (for a friends bday party)
What a difference from my last experience! Everything was delicious! Especially the Lobster Melt! The Thai Beef Salad and the Duck Canneloni! Yum Yum
These are all new items on the menu the waiter told us, and they were delicious! We also has the apple caramel fondue for dessert
WHAT A TREAT!
This place is a great lounge
However, the food is just plain awful
I will return for the party scene, but I will NEVER eat here again
There are much better places in the area to start off a good night in terms of filling your tummy
The meat packing district has become hot and sexy
With that said it's difficult to get in anywhere for dinner without reservation, ditto to get into the clubs
my experience was this weekend
We were a group of four(2couples) and walked around to find somewhere to eat
ONE was the only place that welcomed us, we waited at the bar for a table
Dinner was delicious and surprisingly reasonable! We then went clubhopping to see all the places in the MP area
To our dissappointment it was more difficult to get into these places than it was to find somewhere to eat
When we returned to ONE, the transformation to a sceney night spot was remarkable
a crowd of people waiting to get in
the doorgirl remembered us, and took us in after a few moments
the music was terrific, next time we know to stay the entire night!
When you are waiting on line outside you are led to believe that the reason they are being snooty and rude is because the establishment is full of beautiful people
DO NOT be fooled
After waiting to get in, I was disappointed to see an unhealthy amount of unattractive people; NOT worth the wait
On top of the disappointment, when we were seated our waitress was rude and spilled an entire drink on a friend without apologizing
Management was very nice, however, wait staff should be properly trained
This was on a saturday
One plus was the drinks were reasonable priced
we went one day, and the line up was crazy
considering it was pretty early in the night
the staff were so nice, the door girl seemed to feel bad for keeping us all waiting, and then shortly thereafter
a bunch of servers came out passing hor d'oerves!! we finally got in, which was worth the wait
the people in front of us left because they were cheap and didnt want a bottle between a large group
they told off the girl at the door
who i must say took it quite well with a smile
It's a great place, the terrific service carried out throughout the night as we sat and got some appetizers and then decided to stay for a bottle too!
Ate here Friday was seated right away
The server greeted us right away and was very friendly and gracious about letting us take our time to order food and drinks
Our seats were more like couches and very comfy, the music and ambience are very loungy with lots of space
It was suggested that we share our food which we did because it was very tasty
The bill left us feeling that we had gotten a very good value too
whoever says that it sucks, obviously is too ugly to get in! the people inside are great, the staff is friendly, and once you get attention from the doorgirl, she'll take care of you if youre worth it! HELLO! we are in NYC! no trendy place is going to let a group of people in without a bottle! food is good, crowd is hot, music is fun, and i will keep going back
i recommend this place to anyone who has a clue!
Having heard of this place from so many of my colleagues, I finally had a chance to visit this restaurant
I loved it
It is a very beautiful restaurant not to mention the people
They were very welcoming
Our server was polite and accommodating
The food! You have to order the lobster melt
Delicious! We hung out at the bar all night and had a great time
i have been going here since it opened
there is always a hot young staff willing to do pretty much anything to have fun, not in a bad way
but the food is great and the bar seen is the best of any lounge
they have fun and energtic girls behind the bar
this is a must place to eat laterin the night and stay for 80s90s2000 still music and great drinks
I was there, it was just me and my boyfriend
We had a lovely and romantic dinner
We ended up staying all night and meeting new friends there
The 2nd time around, we were a group of about 10
My friends were from out of town and could not believe how great this place was
Our dinner was FANTASTIC

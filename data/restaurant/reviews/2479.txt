We live in the neighborhood, take all of our out of town guests and think the food is yummy! The service is slow at time, but enjoy a Green Apple Martini or a speciality drink and people watch!
Went on a Saturday night
It was busy, but the whole experience was great
The service was wonderful as well
The waitress was very attentive
I loved the lighting, atmosphere and food
If you're a fan of sushi, and pan asian food, with a little different style, this is the place to go
Try the ruby foo
this place is phenomenal
i go there all the time and love it even more each time
the sushi is to die for and all the entres are incredible- definately go
now
A good place to have a drink (the eponymous Cosmopolitan variant is delicious) and an appetizer or two (high marks for the Chilean sea bass satay)
Cool atmosphere in both the restaurant and lounge
Service was competent but not overwhelming
Ruby Foos was just a block from the hotel that my family and I stayed at on our recent visit to NYC
So we walked over and we were seated immediately (which was great!), but our waiter was had a horrible attitude, couldn't remember to bring lemon for our water, or soy sauce for our sushi rolls, the food was wonderful, but unfortunately the service ruined our visit
After hearing about this place for a while I decided I had to try it out for myself
The food was delicious
All of us (3 people) loved everything we ordered, however we didn't like how long our meals took to get to our table
The people I was with said they would not go back because of the poor service
However since this place has such a good reputation, I figured the bad service that night was an anomoly, so I went back
I shouldn't have, the service was poor again
Bottom line, the food is great, the service is not, if you have an evening to kill and are hungry then this is your place
We went out with a group of 6 people to Evelyn's but were disapointed about the fact that a HUGE waterbug was crowling up our table, we had no choice but leave after paying for our drinks
A little disapointing for a place that has been around for years
One of the best times I've had in NYC, and I've been just about anywhere
The energy is incredibly vibrant, lots of celebs, great dancing, and high-class aura made for a fun night
The club is amazing, with the upstairs being just as lively and romantic downstairs main floor
DJ was awesome, spinning hot hip hop on the main floor most of the night
Very beautiful people
Evelyn lounge is highly recommended AAAAA++++++  Pros: energy, great music, gorgeous people
Was great until I found out they charge $4
00 for tap water
They wouldn't even give us a glass of water after having purchased a wine and a mixed drink
My Honey and myself stopped in for a drink and quiet conversation
What a good choice! Evelyn's has a great Martini menu, tasty food, attractive decor (a little on the dark side), and a great, romantic ambience for conversation
Truth be told, we arrived on the early side
However, by doing that, we had our choice of seats and enjoyed the quiet
The place really starts hopping around 10:30 p
m
We'll definately go back when in the neighborhood
The newly renovated basement level, Kama, is a great change from the previous style
It has an eastern Asia feel and is really quite nice, especially compaired to the rest of the club/bars on the Upper Westside
Drinks service were fantastic and the door staff was friendly and non-confrontational
It looks like they're redoing the upstairs level, so only the lower level is open
For a place up on the west side the only thing this place has that's really good is the decor in the back
You can take someone down to a nice fire, which is key when it's zero outside
Nothing special about it
Bouncers were a little nuts, they made you basically check your coat
Lots of preps here
Place got pretty crowded as well
Well designed lounge, good food and cocktail menu
But obnoxious atmosphere and clientele
If you want a class, go somewhere else
had gone here a few months ago, but only went upstairs
found upstairs to be snotty and boring and overpriced with weak drinks
my review is based on the basement
went back on a saturday night and went into the basement
Paid the cover $5 - in the end was worth it
good place for a group who all wants to do different things - dance, talk, sit on the sofas
makes it a great place to fly solo while your friends are off doing other things
suck up the $5 cover, skip upstairs and head straight to the basement!
In my opinion, Evelyn Lounge is the best kept secret in NYC
Friendly bouncers, mostly non-pretentious yet attractive singles crowd and the layout of the place is ideal for both dancing and talking
Drinks are reasonably priced and the absence of cover on most nights makes me wonder why people would go anywhere else
I happened to go to Shining star for a week in this summer
Breakfast was wonderful at reasonably low price
very friendly wait staff and great brunch on the weekends
Best part was i even could enjoy cheese burger deluxe at 3 AM in the morning
This is a VERY rare find in the upper west side
It is an average diner in virtually all respects, except that it is CHEAP! Cheesburger deluxe was $4
Food is not bad at all
Open 24hrs, so its a great place to go after a long night out
MY FRIEND AND I HAPPENED UPON NEO AFTER SPOTTING THE CELEB PICS IN THE WINDOW
THE DECOR WAS VERY NICE AND SO WAS THE SERVICE
MY FRIEND HAD LOBSTER AND I HAD SALMON AND NEEDLESS TO SAY
IT WAS THE BEST!!!  I LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE SERVICE WAS GREAT WITH A SMILE! CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK
IT'S SOOOO GOOD YOU DON'T NOTICE THE PRICE BECAUSE THE TASTE NUMBS YOUR PURSE STRINGS!!
I truely do enjoy dining at Neo
However, I can only enjoy it on an occasional basis due to the very high prices
$7 for ONE bite-size piece of shashimi
Prices aside, the fish is extremely fresh
My taste buds have been ruined for lunch time take-out spots because they just can't compare
The service at Neo is attentive and the staff is well informed
They're very good with the recommendations if you need help
Sushi and appetizers were very good, but the prices are totally outrageous
You can't find a roll for less than $10, and some are as much as $20
My wife and I have been to Neo twice so far (its a long trip from the East side!), but both times have been really good
Sushi is fresh and unique
Chef uses special sauces to highlight individual fish flavors, making soy-sauce obsolete
Both times we were with a small group, and we ended up trying and liking 6 different appetizers (yellowtail jalapeno was almost exactly like the one in Nobu!)
My only complaint was that sushi pieces tend to be very small (its good if you are in the mood to try 15 different flavors of sushi, but it does reflect in the price)  Neo is not cheap
There were 6 of us, and the dinner was about $80 per person including tip (admittedly, we had a lot of food, and a fair amount of sake)
Ambience is pleasant, and the service was very attentive but not intrusive
Neo has a great menu with some new ideas for sushi
I definately was impressed with many of the dishes
The whole eperience is worth it, except for the fact they have huge prices for their food
I wouldn't make it a routine dinner, butits nice spot to hit
Definitely go on a week night when it is not crowded and you can enjoy the food without feeling cramped

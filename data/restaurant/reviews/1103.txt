Don't forget the desserts
Overall I was very impressed with riverview and hope they'll do well
The Scene Located on a relatively quiet stretch of Mercer Street, this distinctive, atmospheric restaurant takes many a passer-by by surprise
Patrons enter to the side of a huge garage door that opens up during summertime (sit by the front to enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of Soho)
Formerly an auto garage, the bi-level restaurant doubles as an antiques showroom, allowing diners the opportunity to walk away with a full stomach--and an armoire
Accented black-clad waiters add to the hipness quotient, as does an eclectic, international mix of background music
The Food Considering the Garage's unique atmosphere, it's merely a bonus that the menu features affordable interpretations of Mediterranean favorites
Most diners stick to hot (shredded chicken breast in garlic and walnut sauce) and cold (briny tapenade, made with Greek olives, capers and anchovies) meze, served in handsome vintage dishes
I have been so manyTurkish restaurants in New York City, but I've never seen like an Antique Garage; such a beautiful place,such a beautiful cliantales, tasty food, charming servers,bartender,host and Owner,Romance,music everything there
A+++++++++++ Two thumbs up
You must go
Pretty restaurant and nice concept
You can buy any of the antiques displayed (they're marked up heavily so the owner doesnt have to keep redecorating the place)
Some interesting cocktails but rather pricey
Service was very good- prompt, friendly
The compliments end there
Saying the food was average, would be generous
Among the starters, the Pizzette was decent, I'd say the best part of our meal
The Hummus was ok too (but even a supermarket can do that), Borek was way over-salted greasy
We ate the Turkish meatballs which were absolutely horrid- tasteless and rubbery
Maybe we should have ordered the lamb chops that others on this list recommended
I had high expectations of this place and left dissappointed
I went with several friends - they refused to give us one of two empty tables in the front b/c they were reserved
We were seated in the back, the waiter proceeded to raise his voice and was quite rude when we inquired about the open tables
After taking drink orders from 2 of us, he got a call on his cellphone and just walked away
We up and walked out after that
I have been to Antique Garage over 10 times since it opened and the service has just gone to pot
the portions have also gotten smaller
It's really quite sad and I will NEVER go back
I went there with a friend
The staff was wonderful
I ordered the Lamb and I remember thinking I don't want it to disappear
It was mouth watering
The mash potatoes were perfect
The bartendar was especially nice
The owner seemed to be very down to earth and wanted to make sure that I was enjoying myself
I would definitely recommend this place
I'm so happy my friend took me there
This place looks very nice
its a cool place to come with a bunch of people or with a date for maybe a mild dinner or some drinks
The food was good, but nothing special, I've had better and defenatly better turkish food
The drinks were well made, but a bit more then I expected for a place like this
I'd recomend this place for a couple who's looking for somewhere to go on a weekday just to hang out, because the atmosphere and Decor is very nice
other than that, dont go here for dinner
I took my girlfriend to this hidden,romantic place in Soho on Valentine's Day and had a great night out
Antiques and candles all around the restaurant creates a lovely ambience
I had a valentine's day special Ottomon Kabab and was blown away
The service was almost perfect
The ambience and food is just a must!!! I can't wait to go there again
I rate this place 10 out of 10!
Embarrassingly bad food
Absolutely ill-conceived appetizers
The eggplant tasted like supermarket babaganoosh
The pizetta - for 16 bucks - was ham, on a mound of lettuce, over bread
Seriously
My Turkish meatball entree tasted like a frozen TV dinner
It was FOUL
All at fairly expensive prices
This is a must-avoid place, and I am absolutely FLOORED by the decent reviews
I am quite certain my experience was the norm and not a bad night as I ordered very basic appetizers and entrees
AVOID this disaster if you care at all about food
This is my new favorite restaurant-- the food, ambiance, jazz on Sundays make it such a treasure
The only down side is that bloody marys on Sunday cost more than most of the entrees
I recommend Antique Garage very highly to anyone who enjoys great mediterranean food, beautiful calming antique ambiance, and wait staff that enjoy their jobs
The food speaks for itself, it is why we will go back to Antique Garage
The Turkish meatballs to die for
who knew meat could be so good
Two people in our party of four had the lamb, and as lamb lovers they raved
The tuna was HUGE and had a wonderful flavor of red pepper and tomatoe
The octopus appetiser was the best we had ever had
So if your looking for a restaurant where the food is the star
I highly recommend Antique Garage
Loved the set up of the restaurant
Very open and comfortable
We found this place around late lunchtime, so it wasn't busy
It still took a little while to get our drinks and food - But the atmosphere made up for it
I had the Turkish Meatballs, with the Canellini Bean salad, my husband had the sample platter
Everything was delicious! I hope to make it back there again soon
Loved this place! Wandered in here on a Sunday night, great atmosphere
Very relaxing and low key yet has some energy to it
Only problem was slow service, didn't know who our waitress was for 10 minutes
But we were enjoying the atmosphere so much it wasn't enough to ruin dinner
I went there with my boyfriend on a thursday night and i couldn't have enjoyed more
The place is so romantic, design and ambience is awesome, food is very close to excellent
Management and staff are friendly and talkative
I actually felt myself home
for one year I'm trying to make that restaurant to my favorite hang-out, but it is not working: the restaurant still hasn't really improved
First it takes usually 5-10 minutes until somebody brings you the menu, the drinks are coming fast, but then you are waiting for the food forever
For lunch time for example you have to wait between 30-45 minutes, impossible to have a nice lunch during a 1 hour break
The food is good, but sometimes too salty
I ate there several time; just once I enjoyed the dinner a lot: when I was not hungry and had enough time
This beautiful cafe on Mercer Street is 100% perfect! I had such a lovely time nibbling at the little mezzes and sucking down the best mojitos in Soho
Great ambiance, candles lit everywhere! Good for groups of friends or a romantic date
Ask to sit at the vintagey velvet banquet tables
My friends and I love this place!
What you should know about this restaurant before you arrive: it's tiny and the tables are practically on top of each other
The single air conditioning unit made the room bearable, but not comfortable
If you get claustrophobic, this is not the restaurant for you
My boyfriend and I arrived earlier than our friends, and the single waitress (there isn't room for more than one server) very nicely seated us anyway
When the rest of our party arrived, the waitress came over to take our order, and was cold when we told her that we wanted time to think

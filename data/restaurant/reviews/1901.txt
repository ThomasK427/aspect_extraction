Yeah, you get stuck in line with the same Yama crowd, who is interested in stuff like, Oh girl, you'll love this place
Big pieces
I don't like standing in line with those jerks, but the food more than makes up for it
HUGE pieces of delisiously fresh sushi and sashimi; wonderful wait staff
unbelievable!! the sushi literally melted in my mouth
be sure to get the soft shell crab roll and eel avocado roll, both fabulous
the place holds only about 20 people, so be prepared to wait
but go around the corner and grab a beer to make it go faster! be sure to keep in mind that the wait is MUCH longer for parties of more than 2
this place definitely lives up to its reputation
amazing!!
fresh sushi in appropriate portions (not overwhelmingly large like the other sushi restaurant nearby)
service was fine; no problem there
the restaurant is relatively small, which makes it intimate
but no reservations makes for a very long wait, usually of an hour
Yes, you have to line up for over an hour, but it's worth it
The sashimi and sushi are fresher than any other places in the city
Go early, and you won't regret
Yeah, there's a wait, but when I went last the waiter brought out sake to my friend and I, and when we got our food, it was the best sushi I've ever had
I've been looking forward to coming back to NYC specifically for Tomoe
Really incredible meal, reasonable prices, friendly waiters, the most beautiful piece of toro I've ever eaten in my life
Yum!
I have eaten more sushi in my lifetime than I think is probably healthy or necessary by even the most liberal standards, and hence felt it was my calling to finally brave the wait on Thompson street and try some of Tomoe's heralded sushi
The result? Not worth it by any stretch
The wait was um only 1/2 hour on a Monday at 6PM, the fish was alternatingly bland and weird tasting, the waiter kindly answered uh, no and walked off when I asked for a really, really simple soup substitution, and the desert was decidedly un-special
A Baragin, at least? The prices were also relatively high for sushi
Blue Ribbon Sushi is just so close by as to not make it any sort of contest
The best sushi, I have ever had in New York
Always fresh fish, I have never been disappointed!!! Well, worth the long wait!!!
Tomoe Sushi is rated so well every where and I had always dreamed about going there
But it wasn't worse standing for an hour outside on the side walk
The sushi was just bad
There were some ok small dishes but the rice and the fish just didn't marry
It was weird
Don't go there
I live in the area and I've been going to Noho Star for years
The food is always great, service is good and the ambience is also noteworthy
I will keep on going back!
I've never had such a delicious brunch
NoHo Star is going to become my regular Brunch spot
The Eggs Burke with poached eggs, smoked salmon, and hollandaise sauce was delicious! The waitress' have always been very nice and tentative
The atmosphere is relaxing and laid back
It's a great place to meet friends for brunch!
They have a NO reservation policy which is STUPID
I brought in a group of 19 people on a Saturday evening
Despite talking to the weekday manager on the prior Monday, who gave me a hard time but agreed to make a reservation for me since my group was so big
I left my name and number
Who would not want 19 people at 18% gratuity? Of course when I got there, no one knew about our group
Food and service are good, but management will run this restaurant into the ground
The manager obviously gave me a fake yes just to get me off the phone
Unpleasant hostess obviously in a bad mood rudely pointed to a table without even looking up or addressing us
The waitress was in a better mood
Food was overpriced but tasted OK
I would not go there again
This was, by far, the worst experience I have had in NYC
Went for brunch and will never make that mistake again
The service was awful, the food was sub-par and ridiculously over priced for what it was
All-in-all, I will never return to Noho Star, there are far too many excellent brunch spots in NYC to waste anymore time or money here!
While the service at this restaurant was excellent, the food was really quite overpriced
I was shocked to have ordered the Three Leaf Salad for seven dollars only to have it delivered to me with just lettuce and some thinly sliced, marinated onions
For seven dollars? I would expect at least some tomatoes
the fries were $3
50 for a portion about the size McDonald's would serve (supersized) and the hamburger was a little bigger than the size of a half dollar
Though, it was tasty, it certainly wasn't worth $12
50
I had visited Noho Star 3 years ago and was impressed
I was looking forward to my return trip earlier this evening and they did not disappoint I was accompanied by family members including my 91 year old grandmother
Our server Ben was exceedingly helpful and even offered to change my grandmothers water after she complained that it was too cold (we had no idea that he had over heard her)
The menu choices are eccletic and they offer something for everyone Ihad the stir fried filet mignon with chinese greens and the filet was melt in your mouth tender and the greens were just the right consistency
Others in my party had the red snapper special and the grilled chicken special and no complaints here
The drinks were also fabulous
A great dining experience
I've been living in the city for almost a decade, a patron of many restaurants, and have never been to such a horrendous place
Not only is the food overpriced for what you get, the service is unacceptable
The waiters and waitresses have no etiquette or people skills whatsoever
They spill on you without apologizing and completely ignore your table
They are rude and shouldn't be allowed to be apart of a service industry that is based on being cordial and attentive to its customers
Beware
Judging by previous reviews, I might have went on an off day
Staff wasn't very friendly, food was boring and bland, and the beers were warm
However, their outdoor seating was a plus
Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant
Often overlooked, the Noho Star is rarely so crowded that there is a wait (other than for brunch between 1:00 and 3:00)
The food is delicious for all times of the day
I specifically recommend the eggs with potato pancakes for breakfast and the orange beef for dinner
And the calamari comes with a delicious sauce
one of the best in the city
The homemade limeade and ginger ale are both worth the $3
This place has everything! Quality, friendliness, beautiful layout, great wines, moderate prices, great salads, a complete Chinese menu with an open kitchen - what more would I wasnt
The breakfast and brunches are the best in New York City
A winner, my absolute favorite
We've been going to brunch here off and on for the past year and it serves probably one of the better breakfasts I have ever had
The portions are not large (I suggest ordering an extra muffin or something) and the prices are a bit high, but the tastes are excellent
My favorite is the eggs chiapas
I can't vouch for any other meals here, but brunch has always been great
The only other drawbacks are the inattentive servers and this isn't a super fancy restaurant (if that is what you are looking for) - more of a cool diner with great food
Potato pancakes with sashimi on top
Right on! Homemade ginger ale is a must try for ginger fiends
After an extended club run since 11 PM Saturday, here are four guys on Sunday Brunch
Is this the male version of Sex and the City? I think not as we all seriously needed a tummy fix with food that sticks
My friends had their open faced sandwiches, burgers and beers

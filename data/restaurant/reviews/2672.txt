Came out to about $50 per person with entree, (comes with side order and salad), drinks and an appetizer
It was pretty good overall
I'd recommend it
The food was good and plentiful,and I do mean plentiful
The prices are very steep
I ordered the Shell Fish Feast for two
This dish included: 2 half lobsters, baby tails, shrimp, baked clams and king crab legs
Bring a huge appetite
If you have this dish have them broil it, it tastes much better than the steamed version
After reading all the great reviews I decided to try Sammy's
Well, I think Sammy himself is writing those reviews
The food was below mediocre, the decor was cheesy, the service was similar to a seedy diner, the vegetables appeared to be frozen, the fish was not as good as I can make myself, although my softshell crabs were a decent size
The most tasty part of the meal was the bread
The prices are FAR from reasonable
Dinner for 2 without drinks was over $100 for less than appetizing cuisine
This restaurant may appeal to people who find Red Lobster a gourmet place
It can accommodate large parties who don't mind mid quality food
Good place for kids
I was not with a large party or kids
I was with my fiance
I am so sorry I decided to go to Sammy's
It is nowhere near the quality of food you can get in Manhattan
I wish my experience was better
I had really high hopes and expectations after reading all the wonderful reviews
I went to Sammy's a few days ago with a small group of people
even though we arrived for dinner at 6 PM the waiter clearly could not handle the small number of tables he had (approx
3)
He brought our salads, drinks and entrees all at the same time (rather than staggered) then neglected to bring implements to open the crabs, ketchup for the fries, butter/sourcream for the baked potatoes or lemon for the fish
We had to eventually flag down the owner to get these items -- he was NOT happy and explained the waiter had only been with them for a few weeks
However, Waiting 101 rules were being broken all over the place
he also served my nephew undiluted cranberry syrup as a beverage and never brought us the two beers my sister ordered
In the meantime, we'd finished eating and the table next to us hadn't gotten their entrees yet
The owner ended up apologizing profusely but my feeling is, don't put people out on the floor if you can't handle the job
We weren't a demanding group of people and my sister and I both have plenty of waiting experience so we know how hard it can be
What can I say
I frequent Sammy's since I can remember
Mouthwatering dishes
of the feshest seafood I have ever tasted
I live on the upper east side of Manhattan but drive all the way to Sammy's on City Island when I want seafood
The lobster is lobster is the best in New York City
When my Lobster yen call I high tail it to Sammy's
When I crave seafiood the only place I think about going is Sammy's on City Island
Evertime I try another place I kick myself in the rear for not going to Sammy's
I have never been disapointed there
THe worlds best food, is yummy
My meal impeccable and the srvice was great
I especailly love the piping hot Manhattan clam chowder and the oyster rockerfeller as my the whole red snapper cooked on a cedar plank scrumptious
Last night at her insistance I took my Mom to Sammy's for a pre-mothers day diner, since she will be working Mother's day
WE had a super time
although the place was packed we were seated within 15 minutes and the food was so good
all in all my mom said it was the best time she has had in a long long time
thank you Sammy for a memorable evening
by the way we had the worlds best jumbo fried shrimp
I am a lobster freak
I love lobster and whenever I go out I order a large lobster, so as you can see I have eaten lobster in hundreds of restruarnts but recently I had one at Sammy's it is the best one I ever had, it came stuffed with jumbo shrimp and was succulent and tender
I ate every morsel
delicious!
On the recommnadation of my daughter'S boyfriend we dined at Sammy's fishbox on City Island last thurdays even
ing
It was the best meal I have had in many a day
The place was very busy and rightfully so
We waited 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait,
you must go AND TRY THIS PLACE
SAMMY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE
What can I say
this is what every restaurant should be like
But few compare to Sammy's
I eat there every week without fail
They know seafood
I just love This Place
I am a new customer and I shall return ASAP
sammys is the best at seafood its so kid friendly also i always order the king crab legs and jumbo shrimp combo
worth evey penny
They also give you a big chunk of cornbread,bread,cheese,and gardenia on the house
I love the food and the staff is extremely friendl
When I think of seafood I think Sammy's
Wonderful sweet jumbo Maine Lobsters
I just moved to the Bronx from Boston, so I am used to great seafood
I never expected the Bronx to have a seafood restauarnt better than the great ones in Boston, but they do, Sammy's Fishbox on City Island has the best seafood I have ever eaten
I recently took my parent visting from boston to Sammy's they were blown away by the food
I went to Sammy's last week and I couldn't believe it they actually had giant lobsters 6,8,10, 12 pounders
I ordered a 10lb lobster, which was something I have always wanted to do, The loster was only 10 dollars a pound
It was succulent and worth ever penny
My wife and I shared it, it was more than enough for both of us
We also had a great drink called the Killer Bee
It was great and lef our heads buzzing
Grewart restauarnt it is a real happening
I love Sammy's I have been a customer for 15 years and have eaten there over 100 times, I have never had a bad meal in all of those visits
I would rather eat at Sammy's than any other restauarnt bar none
The food is not only great, but the portions are very large
My best friend asked me to join her at Sammy's last saturady night
I really ddidn't want to go up toCity Island, but I am glad I did
I had the best apple martini I ever had and the food was a 10plus
Tnak you sammy's for the best evening I had in a very long time
Great people, great food and drinks
Hi: I am a pilot and travel all over the world
I have eaten in hundreds of Restaurants throughout the world
I have never found a seafood that compares to Sammy's
The first thing I do when I come home from a trip is go to Sammy's for a great meal
My favorite is his extra big Alaskan King Crab legs

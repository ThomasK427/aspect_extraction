Rather, you'd go there for their inventive appetizers, BBQ seafood, nice atmosphere, and good drinks (last I went the Kamikaze was great!)  It's a bit pricey and portion is small, but I love the grilled scallops and shrimps, they were huge and fresh
Something you don't normally find in the US
(In Asia, it is very common to find large fresh seafood in restaurants
)
just fantastic in every way
but pricey
Food is a low carb lover's delight
grilled meat meat meat, salads
chic, trendy, but friendly
just perfect
One of my favorites in the city for several years now
Despite bad reviews I read here, I still wen to check out the place for myself
I was not disappointed! the decor was nice, service was just perfect (prompt and helpful), and the food was delicious! We got to use a little grill on our table to make our own shrimp and fish, which was fun by itself, and came out tasty too! the Pino Noir wine I ordered was great
This place is perfect to go in small groups
Nice experience to share with friends
Yes, the place is not cheap (but what is nowdays?) but it was worth it
The dessert is amazing too (look and taste) I will come back there
My wife and I had dinner here a week ago with several friends
To be fair, dinner was acceptable, though not authentic
The service was abominable, though they perked up when we all stood up to leave after waiting 30 minutes for our check
Having read some reviews here, we can't believe that anyone would be impressed with the decor or clientele
If anything, the crowd (who seemed as if they'd never sat on chairs before) and the sad attempt at a trendy Soho look, detracted from passable food
To be clear, this is not a complaint about the prices, despite other reviews here
Just don't go
This restaurant does not respect reservations at all
The waitstaff is horrible
They brought a bunch of raw meat to the table and didn't indicate how long or how to cook it
They were over an hour behind on reservations
Overall a huge disappointment for NYC
I dined here with my fellow co-workers a few weeks ago
We had reserved the private area upstairs and let me tell you, we had a blast
The soju was to die for and the food was nothing less than amazing
It's a great place to bring a few of your friends and take back some shots of soju and throw some meat on the grill
The waitstaff is very attentive and the manager keeps things running more than smoothly
Highly reccomended
thanks for the great time Woo!
Been to this restaurant twice so I definatly gave it a fair try
I had a reservation both times and waited 1 1/2 hrs
the first time and 50min
the second time
The food was mediocre and expensive the staff was terrible, inept (they brought us the wrong dishes and charged us incorrectly) not to mention extremely rude
I highly do not reccommend this place - it is so overrated
If you don't believe me just ask anyone that has actually been
The food here is good, albeit expensive (24 bucks for a half dozen raw shrimp?) but this is not a korean restaurant
It is simply a Korean BBQ restaurant with other Korean flavored American food
The main problem is the price, outrageous
I guess if you want a scene and dont care about dropping a hundred for the same meal you can get in Koreatown for 40, then this is your place
This was undeniably one of the worst dining experiences of my life thus far
the service was atrocious, the food was only okay, and the only thing going for the restaurant was it's atmosphere
The waitstaff is one of the worst I have ever seen - aspiring models don't automatically make good servers, you know
I would bring my worst enemy's dog to eat here
Never again
I recently dined at Woo Lae Oak with a friend and was quite impressed
The lobster speciality was great as was the BBQ rib-eye
The white Louis Latour chardonnay was definitely worth drinking and complimented the lobster nicely
Both the warm chocolate cake and the apple crumble desserts were to-die-for
Food was ok but not the best
6-7 waiters were more interested in standing together chatting than attending to the customers (only 2 customers were in the restaurant!!)
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the fun part was they sat us next to each other
The only downside was it was quite loud inside that it was helpful we sat next to each other
The service was amazing, consistently checking on us! AND we got to see a celebrity
JaRule!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beautiful decor and we were sat right away
The restaurant setting was beautiful the service was awesome
We ordered variety of dishes such the appertisers Crab wrapped with Spinach, the Whitefish light Tempura Kimchee; for the entrees Grilled Shrimp, Grilled Swordfish, Sizziling Beef, of course the Miso Soup!  Everything were prepared fresh so delicous that we stuffed ourselves
Coming form California with many great Asian restaurants, I was impressed with the food here
all the waiters are good lookig !!! I must say :-) Highly recommended!!
Food was excellent, service was excellent and the waiters were great to look at! They took very good care of us and we had a lot of fun with everyone there! Definitley one of my favorite spots in the city!
we had a fantastic experience at woo lae oak
we enjoyed everything we ordered
drinks and decor are both super-sexy! this is what a sat night in nyc is all about
This place is great! I have eaten at WLO around 5 times, even though I hate returning to restaurants in NY
The food is great, and the experience is so much fun - you will never want to eat in K-Town again after eating barbeque at WLO
The appetizers were very tasty as well
The only drawback was the unhelpful and not-so-friendly waitstaff
If you can ignore obnoxiousness, you will have a great experience!
Woo Lae Oak was recommended to me by a friend and inspite of reading the poor review on NY City search on the service of this place
I decided to take a chance
Huge Mistake !! Fancy does not always mean good
If you want to eat good Korean BBQ 32nd str is the place to go !!
I have wanted to try Woo Lae Oak and was able to dine there yesterday
After reading some of the reviews I was expecting the food to be great
Unfortunately, the food was no where near what I had expected
The presentation of some of the dishes and desserts were great but taste and quality of the food was sub-par especially for the prices that we were paying
The service at Woo Lae Oak left much to be desired
Although it was a Monday night, and seats were empty, it took a waiter at least 15 minutes to take our order for both dinner and dessert
If you want good service and real korean food, go to 32nd street
I probably won't be going to Woo Lae Oak again unless I'm very hungry and have alot of time and money
Great decor, music, sitting and the FOOD was Excellent, with a capital E
Will be back soon
Users' review stating portions too small for what I paid smack of someone who has gotten lost on their way to TGIFridays
Although it isn't traditional Korean fare, the food is fantastic
We had no problems with our resevations and found the service and the meal well worth a wait, had we run into one
Truely an interesting take on Korean
Had a reseervation for 16 for a birthday
After an hour's wait, the manager suggested we split the group in 2 or wait another hour
When we complained, the arrogant manager acted as if we were wrong and actually offended us
We left and went to Mercer Kitchen across the street!
The service was horrible, portions were small for the price that they were charging
How long does it take to bring raw meat to your table? Waiters were not that friendly, seem like they were understaffed
If you are prepared to wait I mean wait then I would recommend you go here

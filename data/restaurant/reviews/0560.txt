The bill came and everything was reasonable - such a great helpful server too!! All in all a wonderful time and I would definitely go back - cool atmosphere too
This Place is the bomb
This is my fiirst review ever , I am usually to lazy to write one but i have been to bao about 20 times since it opened and they have consistentlly exceeded my expetations
Their food is very high quality at a very reasonable price
The owners seem to take very much pride in their product
Impeccable service, food, and personallity
You must really try this place
Great place for late night dining , they are open every night till 2:00 am every night except sundays
Perfect alternative to blue ribbon really!!!!!
after my shift i sincerely enjoy a light deliciously prepared meal accompanied with a great ambience and staff,
very welcoming and comfortable
bottom line: must go!
Monday at 10pm without a reservation, the place was still crowded
The maitre d' was so nice, though, so we waited
When we sat, our waiter came over immediately and recommended the snapper and the pho-- some of the tastiest I've had, and I went to Tu Lan 3x a week in San Francisco
We wanted reservations on Saturday at 8, but the reservationist said she only had 7 and 9:45
Thank god for that sweetheart reservationist telling us to take the late resy and chill first at the bar
Sake Juleps rock
I felt so sorry for the people who walked in on Saturday without a reservation
Man, that maitre d' has a tough job, dealing with all those people, I don't know how she stayed calm
The calamari stuffed with prawns I've never seen anywhere
My friends were so impressed
Can't wait to go back and try everything
The bad experience started off right away, as our waiter was busy on a smoke break and there was no one to cover (he must have smoked half a pack for the amount of time we were waiting)
Being Vietnamese, I think I have a fair estimation of what is considered Vietnamese fare
Someone must have read the recipe book wrong because there was so much anise in the pho (the most classic Vietnamese dish) that I almost sent it back
Also, I know how much hoisin sauce and chili paste I want with the dish
There is no to mix the two together for me (my date doesn't like chili paste, but she does like hoisin, what does she do?)
Since the waiter NEVER checked on us during the meal, she never had the chance to ask for hoisin
Disgracefully awful
We went in, were graciously received wonderful placement and attention
Ordered some sake, wine, apps, entrees and desserts, post-prandial drinks and
everything was excellent
The dishes were made and presented with delicate care
Very inventive plays on traditional Asian food (some making the food unrecognizably Asian, but successful for what they became) and the staff was professional all the way
Beverage list put together with real thought
Perfect in every way! I have been here many times and have always had a great experience
Almost always prompt seating if not, the bar area is fun the drinks are great
To start with the food is outstanding!It's innovative, fun, Delicious! As an appetizer try the scallops with bacon ( I am drooling thinking about them) and the asparagus soup with crab
For dinner my favorite is always the sea bass, it's enough for two people
the most amazing drink I have ever had in my life is their special Bao111 drink, definitely try it
The decor is hip, without trying too hard, the lighting is a mellow dim amber
Go here with a date for a romantic dinner, with a large group, or go by yourself, just go !
I read reviews on Bao and every critic had nothing but praise for this restaurant
So I decided to try out the place and I am so glad I did
The food was delicious and filling
My only complaint would be the small cramped space
There may have been only a few inches between myself and the person sitting to my left
Also the tables were so close together that everytime some one from the next table had to get out we had to shift our tables and vice versa for them when we had to get out
We had the short ribs, as per the suggestion of many a reviews, and they were delicious
We also had a delicious duck dish that I would reccomend most highly of the three we ordered, the mignonette was very good and the vegetable noodle dish was tasty but not outstanding
For dessert the apple springroll was OK, I would get the ice cream which was delicious
Love this place!!! Food is excellent
Yummy Fresh food
Nice presentation and a cool inviting space
Cocktails are strong tasty but a little funky
Spice rimmed glasses take some getting used to
Vegeterian dishes are only okay
I brought my boyfriend to Bao111 for his 25th birthday and had a thoroughly wonderful time
Although we had to wait 30 minutes for our reserved table, we were able to kill time chatting at the bar
The waiter was extremely apologetic about the wait and was very attentive once we were seated
The decor is tastefully hip and not cheesy
The mellow lighting, dark wood, and splashes of red creates the perfect space for a romantic date
The food was delicious and not too overly priced
To start, I recommend the calamari stuffed with prawns and we were pratically drooling eating the duck salad
Furthermore, they didn't charge me for the free yuca mini birthday cake they brought out for my boyfriend (lit w/a candle)
I highly recommend this place for a date or to treat yourself to a nice dinner with your friends
The space is nice
Food is amazing
Staff is friendly
Cocktails are great
I have visited Bao 111 on 2 occasions - once with a large party requiring a prix fixe menu and once with a small group - and both times were enjoyable
For the large party, we had a prix fixe menu with a sampling of 8-9 appetizers/entrees and 3-4 desserts
The portions were suitable and the selection delicious as there were no complaints from anyone in my party of 15
For the small group, we had great service throughout the meal, even as larger parties (with higher tabs) began to show up
I highly recommend the coconut mousse dessert and clams in spicy beer broth
The title of this review pretty much sums up my experience
I've been to this place last night for a birthday celebration
I agree with the other viewers that the ambience is great and service is friendly but nothing can make up for the bland pseudo-Asian fare that they serve
Since there were so many of us, we got sort of a prix fixe dinner complete with seven small dishes and four entrees
You would think that paying $40 per person would get you , if not satisfied, at least full but this is not be the case in this restaurant
After going through many varieties of uncooked rice and overcooked shrimp, we grudgingly paid the totally overpriced bill
If you want to eat Vietnamese food, try some of the more authentic places in Chinatown
The places might not look as good but at least you will get to eat
Bao 111 is a festive kinda place good for celebrating with cocktails, appetizers (try the lollipop chicken, dumplings, ribs) and dessert! (try the creme brulee)  It is more of an elegant fun snacking place rather than a tie the feedbag on place  the service is attentive, the portions small but tasty, cocktails delish
forget the rice and concetrate on the finger food  i was there in December 2003 for a birthday party with a group of ten and although the place is small we managed nicely
I don't get how people can possibly rate this restaurant negatively
It offers a wonderfully intimate ambience, the staff is courteous and helpful and the food is delicious
True, the menu doesn't offer a wide range of choices and portions are not la all-you-can-eat, buffet style (but is that a negative thing after all?)
I personally place Bao 111 among the restaurants for the civilized clientele, that likes when style comes with a touch of informality
This place was great
Great food and great drinks
Try the Perfume River or the Hawaiian Sakatini
Both are great
Bao also has excellent sake
Great appetizers (try the lollipop chicken or the ribs)
To finish it all off this place had one of the most excellent helpings of creme brulee I've ever had
Hey, This place was the best part of my trip
After a terrible stay at the paramount, it was a gem to find this place
The food was awesome, the appetizers even better

I dream about those pies
I don't quite know what they put in the sauce in this place but it makes the pizza unbelieveable! If your'e a beer drinker it's the place for you
Think thin crust, light cheeze, loads of tase!
This is one of the best scenes in NYC
The place is romantic and casual
The pizza is some of the best in town
Forget the other courses
And that's why you come here - an atmosphere that could not be copied or planned - like a happy accident, live jazz, and great pizza
Yum, best pizza in town, as well as best pizza eating experience
Enjoy the outdoor seating, while getting some great people watching in
Grimaldi's and Lombardi's are good, but Arturo's has the total package
After years at school around the corner from this place, it remains the best slice I've had in Manhattan
Just enough tomato sauce, melting cheese and the crust has real flavor
Better than most pies at 2nd Ave
bar/cafes
Dig those ingredients and great crust! A West Houston St
institution with soul
Has to be the best crunchy crust pizza around !! There may be other gourmet selections, but for a plain slice - this is the best !!
This was soem of the best white pizza I've had in town
The sicilian wasn't bad either
Although the menu lacked in items to choose from, the pizza made up for it
I have found a new delivery champion
The price is right for the mediocre pizza; but the pizza, simply put is OK, nothing special
I am not quite sure why all the rave reviews, fantastic crust, amazing pizza, what is so amazing about it
I will agree with the service, wonderful people and very fast delivery
I would recommend that you try it but if you want real NY pizza, try Nicks or Totonnos, it maybe a little bit pricey for pizza but you get what you pay for
Great mussles! In fact, that's what made me a regular at Ginos
Everything I had there was delicious
They don't open until 5 on weekends, which is a big mistake (I'd be eating lunch there on Sundays)
They could uses a better beer selection, but their wine list is ok for a pizza joint
The tables in the back are set aside for dinner, but it's a good place for an informal meal or a good place to call for take out (they deliver)
Try the chicken fiorello when they have it, it's wonderful
The bad news is, they only take cash
He's right, it's not your typical sweaty pizza place
The service is friendly and accomodating and the menu is fantastic
the soups, salads, and entrees are well made
Oh, and the pizza
Crust, crust, crust! You gotta try it
1st of all, its really nice inside
so its not like your typical sweaty pizza parlor
2nd of all, its the same price as all those sweaty pizza parlors and 3rdly, its GOOD
I have mainly only gotten slices and a salad there
The salad was all the freshest veggies and the serving as larger than I had expected for a small size
The 'Za is so good
I recommend the White Tomato, or the Eggplant
Did I say it was good?   There is outdoor seating, and there is good service
People are very nice there too
If you want to be waited on there is a nicer area in the back where you can have a little candle lit table
Its a small intimate place, but perfect if you want a great slice in a clean place
If you like pizza for what it is
hearty, slightly greasy but flavorful, look no further
When I was a UPE resident, I was a regular at this pizza joint
The secret is in their tomato sauce
its to die for and their pepperoni pizza, I miss so much since I've moved to BK
sitting on the corner, it looks rather innocous
it's not fancy and they apparently like it that way
but don't think this place has the food of a dive
the pizza is superb, and you owe it to yourself to check it out
Hard to find this little gem since it's called both Momma's and East Side Pizza
The sign says East Side Pizza, but the phone-customers know it as Momma's
A cheeselover's pizza, heavy on the cheese and thick
Some of the best pizza on Upper East Side comes out of this shack, and also try the gyros (tell'em to go easy on the sauce unless you like it sloppy)
The brothers running this joint are doing a great upper east side service
The Scene The pink dining room, decorated with pictures of Frank Sinatra and the Pope, has seen better days
But the clientele of local businesspeople, shopkeepers, students and residents don't linger long enough to notice
The Food It's hard to top the simple cheese pie with its chewy, firm crust, slightly salty mozzarella and thick tomato sauce
But if you get fancy, you may end up disappointed
Pizza verde, for example, is soggy under the weight of canned artichokes and chopped fresh tomatoes
The same philosophy holds for the dinner menu: While plump cheese ravioli, covered in the same terrific tomato sauce, has an unmistakably homemade flavor and farfalle in Alfredo sauce with mushrooms is mercifully light, bland potato croquettes stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto are proof that sticking with the basics is a good idea
Indifferance is one thing: these guys are rude and unpleasant
the slices here kick serious butt
if you have the time, wait for a fresh out of oven slice of cheese -- truly heaven!!
I have grown up around Mimi's and they have never let me down, great slice, polite people, worth the trip
I went there on a rainy afternoon, and the pizza was terrific, good amount of cheese, sauce, and very crunchy
Never had the chance to thank the guys for the pizza, but I'd definitely go there again!
This place is only good for one thing
a cheese slice
Venture beyond that and you will be disappointed!
Maybe, if you run in to get a quick slice, this place is average
Don't order anything else!! The 'staff' will do no better than a bad Chinese take-out place
With so many new, pleasant, inexpensive places around here now, why keep this dump in business? Because of the paid-off, outdated celeb photo-testimonials? You've gotta be kidding if you say this rundown joint has ambience, charm or good food
Best pizza, owners are so nice, and i love the window dining
Authentic tourist trap style pizza like Mama used to find near Port Authority
$2
10 for a slice!! I know they have to pay the prime location rent, but their slices are loaded with too much bland sauce, not enough cheese and a cardboard crust, all cooked in a fake brick oven
In Short Established in 1939, this fast-food restaurant still makes its legendary fried chicken with the closely guarded blend of 11 herbs and spices originally created by founder Colonel Sanders
Modern additions to the menu include oven-roasted renditions of its chicken sandwiches, popcorn chicken, potato wedges and wraps
Classic sides include flaky, oversized biscuits, steaming-hot mashed potatoes and gravy, smoky-sweet baked beans and crisp, generously dressed coleslaw
Kids and adults love the "little bucket" parfaits of pudding desserts
Typical KFC Fried Chicken fare
Salty, fattening and not good quality
But very inexpensive and open late
The President of Mexico comes here when in town
The food is fantastic, everything is authentic
The atmosphere is charming and spacious, (they have a little waterfall) and everyone there is Mexican
I usually get Watermelon juice (delicious stuff) and enchiladas (they have *mole, de suiza, and verdes*)
There isn't too much north of 96 street and madison
Hanratty's is pretty consistently good
The staff is always very friendly, and if something is not right they try to correct it
Many neighborhood people come here a lot so that says something

The food was good, its hard to share things because each item is so incredibly spiced and the flavors dont match up
The servers were kind, but our particular server was somewhat slow, which can be good depending on your plans
Price was fair, I am assuming that the ingredients are what push the chicken to be priced at $27, but seems a little excessive
The double baked potato was very good, and they really should have a tamale appetizer plate
This was a fantastic meal
The waiters were very polite and courteous (which is not to be taken for granted in NYC)
The Chille Rellano is awesome and their margaritas rock
Bobby Flay's food choices are great
You can tell he designed the menu because all the dishes are inspired by his favorite ingredients such as blue corn, etc
If you are into southwestern style food, you will not go wrong with this restaurant
I recommend it for lunch because there is not a huge crowd
HIGHLY RECOMMEND
I ate at Mesa Grill on 2/20/05, and it was fantastic
The service was perfect, and the food beyond belief
I have watched Flay on the Food Network, and wanted to check out his place
It definitely lived up to the hype
Shrimp and corn tamale with cream sauce was a great starter, and the queso fundido made with goat cheese was the tastyest dip I've ever had
BBQ rabbit was a wonderful entree, but I must say the highlight was dessert
My party got the dessert sampler which included 6 highlights from the dessert menu--each of which were worth the price of the three course meal ($90 per person with margaritas, tax, and tip)
The tequila and pineapple sorbet and the tres leches cake were standouts, as was the apple short cake
A must visit for any New York trip!
Being a big fan of Iron Chef, we expected the restaurant owned by the American Iron Chef to be of a high standard
Unfortunately we were let down
While the appetizer was enjoyable, the entree left a lot to be desired
My wife went for the Hawaiian Sea Bass special (around $30) and was not impressed
Myself I had the Salmon and thought the ingredients just weren't well thought out
The desserts were the highlight, but still didn't justify the $140 (for 2, 3 course, no alcohol) for the entire meal
The service was prompt and polite, but I doubt we'll be going back
I had brunch here and waited 15 mins for our waiter to take our drink order, then waited another 15 mins to get our drinks, then waited another 15 mins for our waiter to take our order because the busboy didn't have authority to do it, then 20 minutes to get our appetizers, get the picture? And on top of everything, the waiter never apologized or offered an explanation
The food was good
So if you don't mind having a 2 1/2 hour brunch, this is your place
Decent food, but horrible attitude at the hostess desk and sub-par service once seated - will not return
I recommend making reservations for a Friday or Saturday night
Numerous people waited over an hour to be seated while my wife and I were seated promptly
Service was good, the waiter friendly and accommodating, food was prepared properly
Salads and Veggies were excellent
But when it came to the southwestern style rib-eye entree, while it was prepared to our order, the meat was a little tough
Considering the $36 price, I would expect Mr
Flay to select better cuts (prime) or get a new supplier
Somewhat disappointing considering his reputation
Made reservations here for their only available time
10:30
Once seated, they didn't even wait for our last party member to take off her coat before pressuring us to order
Check was brought before we had a chance to see the dessert menu! Staff unfriendly and pushy
Food was good but doesn't make up for poor service
I took 8 clients to lunch and was appaled by the overall service
The appetizers and dessert were good
The main courses were OK
This was the worst dining experience in my life
The waitstaff brought 8 of 10 main courses while 2 people at the table waited over 15-20 minutes
By the time the last main course came out everybody else at the table was done with their meal
The manager then came over and offered dessert on the house (which was nice) but had an attitude when I changed the focus to getting the last main course which was still not at our table
The waitress very rudely interrupted us twice to shout out the special of the day and ask if anybody wanted coffee
Overall, the service leaves a lot to be desired and I would never go back to this restaurant again
Bobby Flay has managed to combine interesting combinations of sauces with standard entrees to creat fantastic, unique food
I had spicy halibut with some sauces I can't remember
Apprehensive at first, I'm a picky eater, it turned out to be great! Dessert is good as well
Great comfort food that isn't as heavy as southern cooking usually is
I must to dine at
The service was terrible- our waiter was unable to make any recommendations, mumbled the special and failed to check back during the course of our meal
Prices were excessive - even for the neighborhood- $3
00 for an ice tea? Soda was only 2
50- seems absurd to charge more for tea
The food was OK but nothing to rave about- burgers were boring and generic, 16 spiced chicked tasted like little more than salt and pepper- not sure what the other 14 were
The stuffed chile pepper was good though
I will stick to Bolo when I need a bit of Bobby Flay
The service, staff, and quality of food is amazing
I cannot rave enough about this place
I highly recommend the chef's special every time you go
Never pass up a chance at Mesa grill
If you like to be treated rudely (the waiter literally walked away, without so much as excuse me, but I'm here to take your order and collect a tip, so anything else you say is of no consesquence whatesoever, and I am not going to listen to anything other than your order or check please) and ignored altogether (make your water last!) -- you may be willing to put up with the wait for deliciously over-priced food (it's good, but not worth $32 for the entree + $8 for a side)
For equally delicious food, at lower prices, and a waitstaff that may actually inquire about your needs, and treat you like the paying customer (or at least a human being) go elsewhere
The margherita was weak and totally average - I don't know why everyone raves about them
And these waiters wonder why they get stiffed on the tips!?
I took my wife and 4 year old daughter for lunch at Mesa Grill and we loved it
I called fifteen minutes ahead and was seated promptly at 12:30pm
Mario Batali was sitting at the bar having lunch so I expected an excellent lunch and was not disappointed
Our server was very nice and all service was attentive and efficient
I started with the Tuna+Avocado tartare which was delicious, especially the chile sauce
We had the Cuban burger, the Mesa burger and the 16 spice chicken
Everything tasted great including the fries
This is some of the most flavorfull food I've experienced in a long time
I'm looking forward to dinner at Mesa Grill soon
Although I am not a Bobby Flay fan, I must say this place has really good food
Each of the dishes possessed a little flare some way or another
For appetizer the Cornmeal crusted oysters,shrimp+roasted garlic tamale and blue corn pancakes are to drool for
The main dishes were all excellent
I loved the food and service here, the only downside was the decor was dissappointing and the prices are a bit high (about $30 for an entree
) Def
go try! enjoy
Fact is, the food is not worth what you pay for it
Its good stuff, but not $35 an entree good stuff
Add a very average ambience and some of the worst service I've had in New York, and you get a pretty crappy evening
Icing on the cake: our waitress managed to spill a glass of water all over my friend and instead of an apology she was told good thing I didn't spill the margherita
Charming
The service was horrible from the moment we walked in the door
The hostess eyed us up and down and rudely informed us she would be with is in a moment
Our waiter took our drink order, but didn't return with drinks for another half an hour
Our appetizer? An hour and twenty minute wait
Then there was the waiter who kept trying to give us food that wasn't ours

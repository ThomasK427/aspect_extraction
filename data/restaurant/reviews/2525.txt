For dinner, we had striped bass and rack of lamb
Both we're very good
Nothing jaw-dropping, but certainly worth the money
Our food/drinks (two beers for me, two pinot grigio's for my wife) came to $103
00
I wouldn't run back and make this a regular place for us, but it's worth trying
The unisex bathroom behind the red door was a little wierd for my wife
I have enjoyed the food, atmosphere and staff at vespa for some time now but just recently I hired them to cater a private party off site
It was amazing! The food was incredible and everyone said so! They were the hit of the party (70 people)
The service and food were not compromised by preparing off site and the staff just as accommodating and friendly as ever- of course the garden at the restaurant is perfect for beautiful nights and great food, wine and dessert!
I went to Vespa last Friday, fully expecting an outstanding experience
Once we got there, the server was very busy and inattentive
It was at least 10 minutes before anyone stopped by our table
When she finally stopped by, she told us they were out of lasagna (it was only 7:30!) which is what I wanted because the menu options are ridiculous
It may be creative, but there really wasn't anything on the menu that I wanted
I was expecting normal, great Italian food
I finally chose something that looked rather odd, and then it came out and it was
There are so many great Italian places in the city and the UES
This certainly doesn't deserve to be # 2 for Best of Citysearch
I'd walked by Vespa several times and finally went in for dinner the other night
It was great
The outside garden is perfect and the food was delicious
The atmosphere is a much needed change for the upper east side!
You wouldn't expect a place like this on the upper east side
we went on a friends recommendation and we were very happy
A seasonal menu that was perfect for what we were looking for
We waited a little to catch a seat in the garden and were shocked to see how big it was once we were taken to our table
The service staff and management were extremely nice and took good care of us
We wish we lived closer, but it was definately worth the trip
WE WILL BE BACK!
i found vespa on this site and decided that the reviews were enough for me
the place was packed when we arrived, always a great sign in my opinion
a very very small bar in the back caught my eye, and we sat there
it was the perfect spot, you could see nearly all of the small restaurant, and the prep kitchen was right in front of us
vespa has a great vibe
our server was outstanding, constantly giving us great suggestions for both food and wine
the beautiful girl i was so lucky to be with and i love to share things, we enjoy the small plates
vespa has a great assortment of appetizers at a fantastic value
the wines by the glass were quite reasonable
if you like the smaller places that have a lot of character and charm and outstanding food and selection, you'll really enjoy vespa
Vespa has great food, great interior and great staff
Friendly waiters serve consistently fresh dishes and are knowledgable aout their wines
The music is always cool and never the same
Menu additions range from italian classics to unique fish preparations
And the pasta!!! It's made fresh on the premesis and it is gooooood
Try the cavatelli
Enough said
vespa has become my defaul;t restaurant
7 out of 10 time i dine out is there
was in last night to find new menu changes the duck is now served with a yogurt suace with is non typical for duck but gave it anice mediteranian feel served with beets and apples and some suateed spicach
cant go wrong
the steak is now a rib steak bursting with flavor it was cooked to perfection and the season made for a delicous crust, really great job with teh steak and certainly large enough for a filling meal
also had 2 bottles of and argentinian syrah that was tastey and ligjht and went great with the food and was cheap too
will def be back soon cant wait for the garden to be open
and cant wiat for teh new place in the summer
After trying almost every Italian restaurant worth trying in the East Village, I decided to venture uptown
I had heard many things about Vespa and it was worth the trip
The place is very nice inside, cozy and warm
good atmosphere, good music
The food was great
I would like to go back in the spring/summer and dine in the garden
I cannot say enough about the excellent time I had at Vespa
Once my date and I entered the restaurant (on our first date), I was greeted by the bartender and owner in the friendliest of ways
As i was escorted to my table the ambiance was simply perfect
For starters we enjoyed a wonderful tasting platter that went perfectly with the wine the owner suggested
For entrees we enjoyed a delicious gnocchi pasta and exquisite duck entree
The desert was the perfect ending to a perfect evening
We enjoyed a warm pear tart which was complemented perfectly with some moscoto dolce vino
Besides the phenomenal food, the service was excellent
P
S
the entire wait staff is extremely attractive
Love the place! Great Food, Funky Decor and a great service staff
Has a very comfortable feel
Tried some great dessert wines with our cheese course
We'll definatley be back!
One word
YUCK! The atmosphere isn't bad, but the food was awful
I got a seafood pasta, which was my first mistake
The pasta was overcooked and the seafood didn't taste fresh
On the plus side, it wasn't very expensive so I didn't feel to guilty leaving most of it on the table
I'd strongly recommend Vespa to anyone looking for a nice meal with a cozy ambience
The outside deck is a perfect place for a fun and relaxing meal
The staff is helpful, polite and always smiling
The dj helps make the atmosphere fun and energetic
The food is quite satisfying and made just how you'd like it
It's a fun place to make a regular appearance at
The woman at the door and the waiter were beyond competent and pleasant
The pizza was ok--thin but could have use more topping
The ravioli was not hot enough and was too thick
The place has zero atmosphere
It is cheap
We were over in NYC for my birthdaylast week and decided to book a table at Vespa after reading reviews on Citysearch
This is a brilliant place!! The service was impecable, the food was so great I found myself wanting to order another course
but was too full!!! The seats in the Garden are very romantic and in the warm evenings a cool place to hang out
Will be recommending this to everyone back in London and will be coming back again and again and again!!!
Great Food, had the cavatelli on recomendation and we couldn't stop talking about it all the way home
We were surprised to see how big the Garden really was
and it was packed (we were wondering why there were so few people inside?)The Service was professional and the wine advice was really cool, we had a Spanish White call TXOMIN! We can't wait to go back, there were so many things we wanted to try
a great surprise for the area

The atmosphere is warm and friendly
The service is professional and fast
Overall, we rate Da Rosina the perfect place for a pre-theatre experience
It's no bargain, but few of the Brazilian establishments in midtown are
The interior is nice (though the air conditioning could have been a lot stronger -- it was too warm in there both times I went), and the service is good
Everyone was very satisfied with the taste of their food, although the portions varied depending on the dish
The chicken portions were big, though the seafood portions were small
For example, the shimp stew was delicious and the shrimp tasted very fresh, but it was a $19 entree and had only five medium-sized shrimp
Another person had the steak, and found the cut to be rather skimpy as well (though very tasty)
I've been to several other midtown Brazilians and this is one of the better ones
The caipirinhas are well made, too
A band plays on Fri/Sat evenings
Additionally, the space is a bit cramped
Everything about this place was fantastic
The food the staff, the atmosphere, the music were all great
We were seated immediately on a Saturday night and our waiter was very friendly, joking and laughing with us
The paella is excellent as is the Bife a baiana
I would highly reccomend this place
Via Brazil has been my best latin dining experience in New York City, and is my new favorite restaurant
My first time dining, I ordered this friend codfish which was amazing! I also spoiled myself with the exquisite black bean soup and a caiparina
Delicious
Afterwards, I topped it off with the mouth watering banana fritas, yum! On another excursion, I ordered the Stroganoff De Frango
If you are looking for suculent chicken smothered in the most delicious cream sauce ever, this is your dish! Served over a bed of rice, it was what made me a Via Brazil addict
The waitstaff is very very nice as well as knowledgeable about the food
Sometimes there is a piano trio that leaves much to be desired, but as a jazz musican I am picky about what music I listen to
I would definitely reccomend this for a number of situations
At first sight, looking at the exterior, I wasn't impressed
Walking through the door was like walking into a fairy tale
The decor and ambiance are warm and inviting
The wait staff were among the most attentive and gracious I have ever encountered (it made the whole experience that much better)! The fare was absolutely delicious
It was my first time eating Brazilian and I couldn't have been more pleased
The portions are large and oh-so-tasty
Via Brasil is highly recommended
Three adults and a kid, and everyone loved the food
One of us lived two years in Rio, and two of us are world class cooks
Yet despite high standards, we were filled and thrilled by shared churrascu, moqueca, and vatapa
Via Brazil is a nice little restaurant in the concrete jungle of midtown and it obviously caters to the corporate lunch and theater dinner crowd
The food is authentically Brazilian (one of my dining companions is Portuguese)
I had the paella which was pretty decent, my friend had the mariscada (seafood stew) and her boyfriend had the feijuada (cured beef bean stew) which were both pretty good
The wait staff was knowledgeable, prompt and polite
I've visited Via Brazil many times and it is consistently wonderful
The standout of the Brazilian restaurants on 46th St
I recently chose Via Brazil as the venue for a first date and it didn't let me down
Both the food and the service were great
I particularly loved the Vatapa which was a daily special
The best I've had
Via Brazil will continue to be my resaturant of choice when my mood swings towards Brazilian
Great service! We were seated and served very quickly
Pot roast was good
Romantic atmosphere
Elegant service
Very clean restaurant
Good atmosphere, great drinks, excellent food, and reasonable prices
Definitely on my short list of favorite and frequent dining places in NYC
visited via brazil for the first time,we had only one hour to dine before the theater, they were great
the food was excelent, they were quick without rushing us
we'll go back again

I went with my boyfriend who is Brazilian, and we both loved the food
I recommend the seafood - the Mariscada was wonderful
My date had the mixed grill, which was a medley of different meats, and he loved that also
The atmosphere was charming, and nice for a quiet dinner
Our server was very helpful and friendly and we'll definitely return here soon
This place is perfectly sized - not too big and not too small
The atmosphere is romantic and intimate - and the live band on certain days is the perfect addition
The shrimp dishes are amazing, and the drinks are wickedly potent
This is a perfect spot for a date or to catch up with a friend
Viva brazil!
The Scene It's a wonder that this Italian hideaway is just steps from Times Square
Decorative copper platters hang from brick-exposed walls, white tablecloths glow under soft lighting, and chatty waiters dressed in shirts and ties make newcomers feel like regulars
Repeat visitors--of which there are many--are treated like part of the family
The Food The well-prepared food matches the restaurant's friendly personality
The menu sticks to standard Italian dishes--linguine with clam sauce, chicken parmigiana, and fettuccine Alfredo--but the reasonable prices add to the charm
Start with the antipasto classico and sample over-stuffed mushrooms, well-seasoned baked clams, and tasty eggplant rollatini
For a special pasta dish, try the house-made black linguine with sauteed shrimp, scallops, squid, and littleneck clams
Hearty appetites race to the veal Sorrentino, topped with mozzarella and Prosciutto, but be sure to save room for the heavenly tiramisu
The restaurant is currently closed - check their website for the new location, opening in September 2006
Arrived at 6 PM for reservation
Were told (by manager? owner?) we'd sit in a minute
After 10 minutes (we had 8 PM theatre tickets) we asked again how long, and were told  we were NAGGING
Other tables had been sat before us, and when you looked around,  no one eating looked even close to finishing
At 6:30 we again asked about our table and WERE TOLD TO LEAVE!  This place is friendly? NO
This place cares about it's patrons? NO
This restaurant experience was the worst I have ever had
Never would I expect  such unprofessional and rude conduct from a restaurant with this reputation
You make a reservation weeks in advance for 6 PM you expect to be seated within minutes
Who wants to be seated late and then be rushed--have to shovel down your  meal and run to the theatre for your show? At the very least the gentleman (?) managing the restaurant that evening could have been professional by speaking kindly to us--maybe apologizing that they were running behind--instead of berating and insulting us
Trattoria Trecolori is my favorite italian restaurant
im indian but i love going here with all my italian buddies from the office
The food is great as well as the service and the price is right
A perfect pretheater experience: so convenient, such a bargain, such a friendly, well-trained staff, well-prepared Italian food, big portions, a $14 half carafe of a decent wine
It gets crowded, be sure to make a reservation
I found this great restaurant about 8 years ago
Everytime I get to NYC, I make it a point to have lunch or dinner there at least once -- well maybe twice
The food is always fresh and the service is with a smile
I recommend this to everyone from St
Louis who is heading to NYC
So hope that you will enjoy it too
If you are going to a show it's right there off Broadway and if you arrive a little before 6 pm you almost always get seated right away
I love it here and so does everyone I bring with me

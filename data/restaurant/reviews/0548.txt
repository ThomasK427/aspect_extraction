When you're feeling that random craving for pizza or something of the sort, head to Quizno's
I think they make excellent subs and offer a lot of variety
It's not gourmet but, it certainly beats subway
Koryodang has great desserts for an affordable price, though the drinks and specialties (like shaved ice) are more expensive
The shaved ice (pot-bing-soo) is excellent, and is topped with fruit and ice cream
The green tea milk shake tasted especially refreshing after walking around on a humid day
The atmosphere is modern, very clean, and spacious
It's a great place to hang out with friends
Pot-bing-soo is a bowl of crushed ice and plenty of yummy toppings: jellies, beans, rice cake and fruits
I don't really go there for baked goods
Their dinner rolls are normally to take home
I go there to meet friends and chat away for hours
:P
The food is decent but the wait staff on Saturdays are unbelievably rude
The service was bad and everytime we asked where our food was etc
we were told that the restuarant was busy - no apologies or smiles
They obviously have not come to terms with the fact that they are wait staff and their job is to ensure good service
There are too many good restuarants in New York to put up with service like this
I am fortunate enough to live very close to this bakery
First of all it smells really awesome when you pass by
the rolls are always fresh and they have wonderful chocolate-almond croissants
In the summer they have seats outside
If you are every in the upper west side you should definitely stop by
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor
Nice variety of sandwiches, all of which are light and refreshing
The service is a quite slow, but friendly
I consider myself a pastry/dessert connoisseur, and this place rocks! Not only is the food great, but the staff is also wonderful, which is sometimes a rarity
Their pastry (pain au chocolat, brioche, etc
) are excellent, as are their chocolate brownies, eclairs, and chocolate mouse round thing-ys
I ordered a pie from them special for Tksgiving
and that was the only thing I was disappointed with from them
(I think perhaps they overdid it, and maybe accepted too many holiday orders
) But all in all, this places is a real gem
space is small but these breads and pastries will leave a huge impression on you
in a good way
great coffee and the chocolate chip cookies, cheese sticks, and croissants are super
The beautiful storefront and bright, though small interior only highlight the amazing breads and pastries they have
Everything is made right there - you can see the bakers working behind the racks, and the atmosphere is so pleasant it's hard not to stop in every day for a cup of coffe and a baguette for the road
I've developed a serious dependance on this bakery
This place has fun live music, a great staff, and good burgers
They also serve beef wellington, if that's your thing
The chicken was a little salty, but otherwise I have no complaints
On Monday nights, they have a vocalist/pianist who can sing almost any Beatle song, plus a range of other pop music
If you want to hear a specific song, you can request it (and even sing with her!)
If she doesn't know it, she can arrange it for the next Monday
The crowd is eclectic, but not the same crowd as Stonewall Bar/Inn around the corner, just to clear up any confusion
It is gay and straight (and everything in between) friendly
Oh yeah, they also have seating outside in the warm seasons
This is the worst place I've ever eaten
Service is sooooo slow, cooks and cashier are abrupt and disinterested and waiters are non-existent
Steaks are in pre-packaged vacuum sealed plastic, they are tough and taste like
NOTHING
Mashed potatoes are from the box (just add water), and sloppy salad
SIMPLY AWFUL!!
Just because there is a long line does not mean that the restaurant is good!   The steaks were overcooked, bland and mediocore quality
The service was slow
The dining room is in need of a major remodel
Not a good value
I didn't even feed the left overs to my dog
I will NEVER eat there again
This steak house is great for breakfast, lunch or supper! It is inexpensive the ambience isn't great but who cares when all you wanna do is get your teeth into those T-Bone Steaks!
In Short Denizens of Kips Bay believe Pizza 33 is the real deal
It's perpetually packed with neighborhood kids and their parents (or The easygoing atmosphere and kitschy dcor, punctuated by gilded mirrors and a giant hanging cupid, add to its charm
The kitchen specializes in thin crust pizzas topped with exotic combinations
Quattro stagioni boasts mushrooms, artichokes, olives and prosciutto
For those less adventurous, there are of course traditional slices,as well as heroes, calzones, garlic knots and salads
Simply amazing, the sauce is on the sweet side but incredibly unique
This is one of the best in NYC
Granted I go to this place anytime of day or night, but always the most fun stumbling home from the bars at 4am at which time you can see minor celebs from the Hill area doing the exact same thing
Great minds think alike
During the blackout, Pizza 33 was charging $24 for a soggy plain pie
I wonder how much of that markup found its way into the workers pockets as I wouldn't have minded tipping the guys working there, it was hot as hell
Way to support your community, Pizza 33!  Anyway, the pizza is ok at Pizza 33, I prefer Patsy's though
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap
It's only $1
95 for a regular slice and $4
00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3
25 too
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2
50
It's a steal! The pizza is good though
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice
Always busy but fast moving
Great atmoshere and worth every bit
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
This place never closes
when do they sleep
Better Yet, who makes that delicious pizza
We all Love Pizza 33
This place is awesome , open late especially on the weekends and the pizza is delicious c'mon who doesn't like pizza
check this place out yourself and tell me if brick oven doesn't make the difference
PIZZA 33 HAS THE BEST PIZZA IN ALL OF NEW YORK!!
the best pizza in the 5 boros
i come from staten island to have a slice,you know its good
Best Pizza I have had
Cleanest pizza place I have ever been to
I love Pizza 33
The thin crust, a bit of tomato sauce, a slice of cheese and a basil leave
spells heaven !!!

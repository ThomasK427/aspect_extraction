Services was wonderful and the guy at the bar makes you feel at home
We came here after a recommendation from the Times
The food was delicious and the service was great
Although they had asked us to move after a seating arrangement faux pas, they were gracious enough to compensate us with some extra free food
The server (Jasmine) checked up on us periodically and was patient as she explained certain menu items
Even with all the food and drinks we had, the bill was still under $50 for two people! Highly recommended
My husband and I have been to Luz's many times and each time, we thought the food was yummy
The service has always been so-so (long waits) but the food tasted better than we thought, given the ambiance
Since it got cold, we started ordering deliveries and noticed that the quality of the food was not as good
I guess they pay more attention to dine-in customers? Today, we ordered the rottiserie chicken and it was horribly dry and to make it worse, they forgot the sauces
It was so dry the meat actually break apart when you try to pick them up! We called the restaurant thinking that they would appreciate our feedback (since they are good with their dine-in food) but instead, the response was a cold okay, we will look into it and clicked, the guy hung up!
Place was great, food was excellent
Skirt steak marinade was good, but maybe because I got med/well, it came out rubbery
but the pulled pork dish was wonderful
service was ok
waiter/waitress both saw that I left the skirt steak untouched and didn't ask me how it was until they cleared the table, even then she didn't do anything about it
would definitely go again
The ambience is great
The restaurant is a great addition to all the others in the area, and serves amazingly delicious food
Ambience is absolutely cool
Sitting at the bar and drinking and ordering food is my favorite
Their appetizers are superb
Their entrees are all great
Only wish they would add more as I have had all the ones on the list already
Their desserts are so yummy
The owners are always around and make you feel at home
And now they have brunch on weekends too
what more can you ask for !!
I don't know what the guy in the other review was talking about
First of all, the neighborhood has some of the most beautiful brownstones and blocks in New York City--so maybe you should stay put in stroller city because it sounds like it was too much for you to handle
Secondly, I imagine it'd be tough to tell the ambience of a restaurant when it's closed and you're looking through the window
So the food and drinks are delish, especially for the price
I'd recommend the arepas (they're the best I've had), the shredded pork or the churrasco (and I'm not much of a meat eater)
And for dessert try the Mexican Sopressa; it's divine
Salute
Please do dress up or you will feel out of place
This is a very nice place with lots of professionals in their 20's and 30's
I have visited three times and certainly had a good time and really good meal
Drinks are excellent
Lamb chops, pork, salmon
yam
This is not a shabby brooklyn place - design is clean and modern, a welcomed change
Fridays and weekends make reservation, I had to wait 30 min for a table in the evening
Great place to have a date with your friends and few mojitos
I went to Luz on a weeknight to have a few apps and a couple drinks
The service while sitting at the bar was excellent
The bartender was very friendly as was the owners mother who I spoke to outside
They have an extensive list of cocktails and mojitos
I tried a watermelon mojito which was just the right blance of watermelon, rum and mint
Their cocktails are also very affordable at $6 for a good sized mojito
The arepas were also excellent and topped with cilantro pesto and feta cheese
I also tried the crab salad which was good, but the flavor of the crab was a little over powered by the citrus juices they used to make it
I will definitely be headging back to for a full meal
After reading an excellent write-up in the paper, we decided to try Luz for lunch on a Friday afternoon
The day was beautiful, so we decided to walk from Park Slope (Brooklyn)
Bad idea
The neighborhood is sketchy
Don't walk
Nevertheless, we made is safely
Luz is closed for lunch
Maybe they're open for lunch on some days and closed on others, but this scheme is known only to them
So, don't walk and call before going to make sure they have decided to open on that day
Lastly, the place has all the ambiance of a tiny California burrito shop
Don't get dressed to go
Dress like you're going to get a slice on the corner
My wife (who happens to be Argentinian) and I have been to every Argentinian restaurant in the city and were excited to recently discover that a new one had opened up in our neighborhood
We would have to put this one at the top of our list
The empanadas were great, the preparation of the meat was excellent, and the service was prompt
Nothing like the dulce de leche panqueques to top it off
We are definitely going back!
I went this evening to Cambalache after the folks at the Argentinean General Consulate recommended the restaurant
We were seated promptly in the smallish dining room in the back of the restaurant
The wine list is an excellent cross section of Argentinean wines, but expect a 4x overprice over retail price
Argentinean cuisine is about the basics, and the menu gets it just right: the food is not pretentious albeit tasty
The entrees are quite simple and, of course, steak is what's for dinner
Brings memories from back home
we are definately going back!
Great food, friendly service, I'd definitely go back with my friend from Argentina
I go to Pampa (UWS) often, but since I was in the East yesterday decided to try the new Cambalache (same owners than Pampa)
I went with a friend for dinner and had an excellent experience
Empanadas were juicy; the batter melt in your mouth, and the chimichurri - on the garlic side- was a perfect complement
A arugula salad with whole grilled calamari amazed me
Pastas are good, althought the skirt steak made a spectacular entrance and performance
Both the tiramisu and the mandarin sorbet are woth it
Some special house cocktails looked interesting but I decided to stick to the good Argentenean wines available
Overall, it is a cute neighboorhood restaurant, very worth to try, and a good choice for vegetarians also - my friend didnt have a hard time finding options in the menu
Cambalache (formerly Muggs) is an appetising addition to the UES restaurant selection
Though the food is very good (empanadas, steak with corriander, dulce de leche crepe and especially the home made gnocchi on the 29 th of the month) eat it soon as this is unlikely to last in this location
The service is manana and the atmosphere too bright so for the price tag an overall pass for a dining out experience
However, for ordering in good food to drink with a nice vino this performs well (even the steak travels)
You might find the name, Pearl on the Sushi, a little inscrutable
Then again, the food served here also seems to fit its inscrutable persona
The first time I ate here, the waiter suggested the Black Dragon Roll and it resounded with fresh minced tuna with a lightly spiced dressing stuffed into the middle of a roll wrapped with avocado and cooked eel, then topped with a sprinkling of sweet black sauce
The second time I visited and ordered the same roll, the minced tuna screamed with seasoning too spicy for my palate and the black oozy sauce smothered the concoction
A disappointment
The miso soup, though not packed with flavor, is packed, with seaweed and tofu
It was excellent
The so-called salad is merely iceberg lettuce topped with the standard Japanese ginger dressing
So Pearl on the Sushi seems to have potential, but some days it doesnt
If you're looking for excellent sushi including rolls you've never before thought of, then this is the place to go

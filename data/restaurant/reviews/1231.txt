Keep it up
don't get fooled by the TVs like me and a friend did
this is NOT a good place to watch football on a weekend afternoon
way too quiet (i felt guarded in my cheering) and the menu lacks good bar food (no wings, pretty lackluster appetizer selection, etc
)
Meet a date for a drink on Friday evening
The food was good and the bartenders were pleasant and attentive
The decor in the Banc is tasteful, however the music a bit tired once the DJ showed up
When I hear songs like Let's Get Loud and It's Getting Hot in Here, I think of a wedding out on Long Island
This is not what I want to be reminded of when in Manhattan
Finally a place where you can have a good time and the staff is really nice
I recommend the Crab Cakes
A saturday afternoon wandering around the city with my sister decided to stop into the Banc Cafe and we were so glad that we did
The food was delicious and our server was both pleasant and helpful
The decor in the Banc is tasteful, creating a great atmosphere both day and night
We didn't want to leave but have decided to return often with the many overseas visitors that we are expecting
Enjoyed the music, a great mixture to satisfy all tastes
I love the Banc Cafe! I've been here for dinner a few times and this place doesn't miss a beat! Great food, great service, friendly atmosphere and terrific value
The bar scene is lots of fun in the evenings, especially when you can sit outside!
I live on the upper east side, but met friends at Banc Cafe recently
I eat out 3 to 4 times a week this is the first in quite a while that I have been impressed to the extent that I felt compelled to comment on it
Four of us had dinner
We shared two appetizer sampler plates between us, (excellent)
I had a Salmon entree, it was really, really good
One of my friends had a chicken dish, she said that it was wonderful
Server was friendly attentive although I had difficulty understanding her when she was explaining the specials, she spoke with an accent
The prices are also decent
I don't live nearby, but I will definitely go back there
Very cozy, great for lunch and dinner
Great to eat outdoors on a nice day
Food taste great
Nice atmosphere and people
Great location
This seemed like it might be a nice addition to Murray Hill, and it does work on a certain level
The food was excellent
This place's problem is that it doesn't seem to be able to decide on it's identity
When you're charging upwards of $28 an entree, you expect there to be a focus on the food more than the scene
The atmosphere is bullied by the music filtering in from the bar section and the presence of a TV in the main dining area
The wait staff were less than attentive, and the table for four was cramped
If you're going to spend this kind of money on dinner, you can do better
Visited the new banc cafe last weekend, what a  transformation from what used to be there
Four of us had dinner, food was tremendous, service was friendly efficient, the d
j spun a nice mix of R'nB house hip hop, the crowd was definitely into it
We loved the decor which has a retro bohemian feel, the curved banquettes are great the martini's are served in nice oversized glasses
We will definitely be making this are new hangout
Calling this place a cafe is a stretch
It's more restaraunt lounge
Given that, it's not another god awful exclusive lounge with velvet ropes
Myself two friends went for dinner
In a word Great Try the Tuna Steak
Server was very friendly
Definitely a neighborhood crowd
Good
Had a couple of beers at the bar after dinner
If you can handle a bustling scene you'll like this one
It's a Sat night
A buddy and I are itching for a game of pool
We head to what used to be Bank Cafe, a pretty damn fun bar
All remnants of what used to be are gone, including the pool tables
And now, its piker 21 year old admin
assistants as far as the eye can see
blech
This is such a nice little place, with a homemade touch
The owners are too lovely, this was the first time I tried this restaurant to cater my corporate event
They did such a job, my clients were so impressed with their little desserts and the amount and selection of food
Their prices are very reasonable and the variety of food was wonderful
It was a pleasure working with them, and recommend them to everyone I know
Thanks, Alla from NY Medical
My friends and I often go here for brunch on the weekends
The food is really yummy
We love their omeletes which are never greasy and their desserts are top notch
Great place to stop by before or after a movie at Kips Bay
I often eat at Indulge either before or after seeing a movie at Loews Kips Bay
The food has consistently been good and the wide variety of desserts is nice, especially for an evening coffee and snack
I've never been for brunch, but the menu looks good
Stopped by for brunch yesterday and was very happy with my apple french toast
All the pastries look so delicious but I was full so I will have to wait until next time
It's a great little spot to hit before going to the movies across the street and a nicer alternative to a diner
Don't waste your time with this place
I ordered the pizza, and my boyfriend ordered pita w/ steak, peppers, and onions
The delivery boy took over an hour to deliver, so the food was cold
My pizza was burnt (a common occurrence with pizza delivered in Bay Ridge, I have found), and the pita sandwich was pretty dry
I was sincerely disappointed, I had high hopes for this place
You want healthy food, just make it yourself and save the money
I should've known, anyway- how likely is it that you will find a good healthy place to eat in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn?
Wonderful and delicious food
Try the calamari and seafood, all very tasty
Nice environment and good staff
Owner is awesome and very welcoming
Enjoy!
As a recent transplant to nyc, i've been searching for that famous New York City pizza
Salvatore's is the first pizza place I've been to that is special enough that I want to go back
It's certainly the best pizza I've had in the South Riverdale/Kingsbridge area of the Bronx
A pleasant atmosphere makes it a good spot for a casual dinner, although I was there for a Sunday lunch
The Scene Located on the ground floor of the Washington-Jefferson Hotel, this lesser-known Japanese spot is an oasis for theater-going foodies
The minimalist, brightly lit front dining room is lined by a long sushi bar, often occupied by Japanese businessmen
Extra-large pen-and-ink drawings of fish give the sushi chefs an elegant backdrop
In the cozier back room, additional tables are set beside a dark wood bar
The Food Chef Hisao Shimizu's delectably fresh and generous omakase platter entices sushi connoisseurs
Starting at $30, the daily selection may include rich toro (tuna belly), briny bubles of ikura (salmon roe), and creamy uni (sea urchin)

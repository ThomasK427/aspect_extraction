We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed
While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate
Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back
As a group of 4, we went to Charlie and Sharon's small but very warm eatery last november
It was a fantastic experience
I recommend a tasting menu, as they will provide a small amount of everyting they offer that evening
Presentation was beautiful, service was efficient yet relaxed, and above all the food was the best dining experience I have ever had
Just when you think you have had your fill of the incredible entrees, the desserts and dessert wines are worth saving room for
We never felt rushed, and were attended to with care by both Sharon and Charlie as well as their waitstaff
They absolutely do make an effort with children, once creating a lovely peanut butter and jelly sandwich from a buckwheat crepe that was a winner
Go early if you can, make reservations, and expect to be dazzled
This place was not ALL THAT! There was no ambiance
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room
The overall feeling of this restaurant was AWKWARD!The food was just ok
And a little too pricey to be just ok
Very few wines by the glass and a small menue
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead
Usually never take the time to write a review, but just felt I had to, just for this one time! Last night we celebrated our anniversary with a very special dinner at the Grocery
Everything was just perfect, glass of champagne when we sat down, wonderful squid appetizer that we share, my husband boneless trout and I had the lamb chop and a wonderful, delicious dessert served on a happy anniversary plate
It was our first time at the Grocery, but we loved it and from now on it is our special anniversary restaurant! Thanks so much all of you at the Grocery for making our anniversary even more special!
I was stunned at how mediocre our dinner was
Truly, an utterly average experience
The food is between fair and poor: asparagus that was overdone and miserably plated; risotto that was loose, runny, and poorly flavored; trout with mushrooms that was overcooked and mushy; and lamb that was poorly butchered and needed salt and pepper
To their credit, they did not charge us for half-eaten entrees, the one highlight
With only about 15 tables in this cramped restaurant, I highly recommend making reservations
The food was wonderful, the homemade ice cream was outstanding but I think the detail that makes this place stand out from others is the fact that there were about 8 people attending to us the whole time, so in a way, it felt like we had a personal waiter/waitress and this is always a bonus since I have been to too many places where you can never find someone to help you
If you go, order the roasted chicken, and don't be surprised if you are sitting quite closely to someone next to you
This is one of the best restaurants that I have been to in New York City - the service was incredible, everyone was very friendly and nice and the food was unbelievable
I highly recommend this restaurant
As vegetarians who still like bold flavors it's not always easy to find great restaurants
The Grocery went above and beyond to create a memorable dining experience
The chefs came out of the kitchen to make some suggestions on how they'd alter meat dishes to be vegetarian friendly and what they came up with was just amazing
It's so nice to meet such flexible chefs
They seemed not just accommodating but inspired at the challenge! The waitstaff was also incredibly helpful and warm and the wine and desserts were fantastic
The best restaurant experience we've had in a long time!
i dont understand those who go to this restaurant and dont think the food is amazing
while the menu appears sparse and simple, the food is complex
i had the duck risotto, which was sublime
although the price is somewhat higher than most restaurants on smith row, it is well worth it
I was visiting from San Francisco recently and decided to try The Grocery after hearing about it on NPR
I could not have been happier
The food was stellar
We had the foie gras appetizer which was lovely
I had the slow rendered duck entree
It was the best duck I've ever had, it truly melted in my mouth
The Gingerbread Pudding desert was delicious
The service was also excellent
The restaurant itself was small but very charming
Overall, it was an exceptional dining experience that I would (and have) recommend
perfect
lovely
The staff: professional and friendly
They know the menu and the wine list
The food: perfect
complex
fascinating
The chef and staff: made us feel like we were guests in their home
cons? hard to get a table these days
alas
Went here a few weeks ago and was impressed enough to definitely want to come back
Reservations are tough to get last second (we ate at 5:30 pm)
It is extremely small but the service is EXCELLENT and the chefs/owners wandered the restaurant to ensure everything is meeting expectations
Everything we had -- a special tuna tartare, squid and lamb were wonderful
The pork chop was a bit on the salty side but that is our only complaint
Wine list was great and reasonable
Thought for the quality of the food, the price was definitely reasonable
the grocery is one of the most amazing restaurants in the city
i'm lucky it's less than a block away from me
with its soothing ambience and clean minimalist setting, nothing is distracting you from being able to focus on your food - which is outstanding to say the least
the service is meticulous and unpretentious, the wine list is selective and tasty, and the cost of the quality of food you're getting is unparallelled
What great food
What great service
What great people
Compares to the best of the best
Everything on the menu was perfect
The owner/chefs spend a good deal of time chatting and serving and enjoying their guests
If I lived nearby, I'd be there nightly for dinner
30 seats - all filled, all night long
Could not be more pleased
Tough for a larger group except if you have enough to take all 30 seats
The place is expensive for Brooklyn but well worth it for a special occasion
Bottle of wine, apps, two entrees, and one dessert came to $150 with tax and tip
which for Number 7 on Zagat is a bargain
The food is very very good - the duck for an entree and mushrooms for an app are a cant miss combo
Reservations required
Started with Mushroom tart, wonderful
Dinner was a somewhat bland pork chop with apple dressing and so-so fish (can't recall what type)
Service was phenominal, very cramped dinning area
I guess you either love it or hate it
I consider myself to be a restaurant guru so I think my opinion of the grocer carries more wait than the average Joe who post his overview of the restaurant
I have dined in almost every high end restaurant in all of New York from Savoy to Candela to River Cafe and without question the Grocer has the best food
Good place to take a date, but make sure you save your money first because as in life good things cost money
The same applies here you will get great food but you will waste easily over $200 on dinner including drinks and tip
What a fabulous restaurant! After many attempts to secure a table (reservations needed) my husband and I finally made it there
Well worth the attempts! The food is absolutely wonderful
The tables are a little too close together for my complete comfort
It's expensive, do it for a special occasion
But well worth every penny!
This is a serious restaurant
Seriouly amazing food, serious waitstaff trying perhaps a bit too hard, a very serious chef/owner who is quite into what he's providing to the lucky Brownstone Brooklyn foodie/yupster/intellegencier crowd

He has clearly dined a couple of blocks down
My suggestion: If you want to get a good deal and good food: Go to Spice, which is a couple of blocks down but is Thai (and not Indian)
If you want to get a good deal on Indian food: Indian Row on 6th Street
Great value for authentic Thai food - setting is fun and clubby, service is good too
Only gripe is poor ventilation - u come out smelling like what you and all the other customers ate
The platters are the best way to go
They're a good value and you get to taste a variety of things
And the food is definitely a cut above your typical carryout curry shop, though maybe still a bit overpriced
The room is gorgeous, and offers intimate seating in booths along the wall
Make reservations; this place gets crowded
One definite negative--the bathroom
Everything is fresh and tastes delicious
save lots of room for dessert (you'll need it!) Fantastic ambiance- great for no more than 4 people at a table
Service is wonderful- I've sat there for over 3 hours at dinner and never felt rushed to leave
Open until late with sidewalk seating on sunny days, Caffe Raffaella is my preferred place to go whenever I'm looking for a sit-down meal or a cup of coffee with some pie a la mode in the Village
(Especially on days when I'm inclined to do both
) With its bare brick wills and incandescent lighting, there's nothing too fancy about Caffe Raffaella
But the preposterously grand, mismatched but comfy chairs combined with the uniformly friendly waiters make this a great place to pass an hour or more
No one's rushing you out; there's rarely a rush to be anywhere else--especially if you're dining outside with a friend and watching the human throng swim by
Might I recommend the salmon?
This is the place to come for coffee and dessert; they have an enormous and decadent selection of cakes, pies, and other things involving chocolate
And the eclectic array of big chairs and tables adds to the charm
I love the Miss-Havisham luxe decor and have had some really lovely (and generously portioned) dishes at Raffaella -- pumpkin soup is excellent, spinach salad's a winner, and the ravioli is luscious
But the service, though invariably genial and helpful, can be weirdly haphazard -- waiters disappear mysteriously, only to reemerge just when you've decided their shift must have ended -- possibly an understaffing issue? Nonetheless, a lovely coffee stop-off or luncheon spot
The Scene Service bustles through the energetic, sprawling space with the precision of expert merengue dancers, and everyone else goes along with the flow suggested by the tall, curving ceilings
Tropical colors evoke island warmth; patrons seem pleased as rum punch about the elbow room, despite such an impressive crowd
The Food Consulting Chef Douglas Rodriguez's forte is blending the diversity of traditional Latin cuisine with modern culinary chic: A celery sorbet cools the spicy-citrus bite of lobster; shrimp seviche and crunchy green plantains coat thick, juicy halibut resting on sweet plantain hash; and tart tomato escabeche moistens a chewy skirt steak
Amusing details distinguish desserts, from dulce de leche ice-cream profiteroles dotting a chocolate sauce tic-tac-toe board, to coconut custard surrounded by a sea of Malibu-rum gelee and poached pineapple
Close your eyes--the pina colada-inspired combo will whisk you away to island bliss
A friend and I went here for Restaurant week and had a great time! the place was surprisingly packed for a monday night but we still had great service
The food was great- try the dark chocolate cake for dessert- its fantastic! we also got a pitcher of sangria blanco which was really good also
We had fast, friendly service and enjoyed a great meal
My experience at Calle Ocho was excellent from the beginning to the end
The restaurant is gorgeous and designed perfectly
The lounge is located at the front of the restaurant - a great spot to have drinks and appetizers after work or late night
As you walk in further, you realise the place is bigger than you expect
The main dining room is energetic, colourful and whimsical - v
South American
Our server was excellent - esp
since the restaurant was packed
Went there for restaurant week and actually ordered from that menu! The appetizer, conch fritas was yummy; entree, spicy shrimp with coconut rice (just a hint of coconut - not overwhelming); and the dessert tres leches de mango with calle ocho cafe was unbelievable! I was pleasantly surprised at the whole restaurant and despite the fact that I am never uptown - I will definately make it back here again!
I had a party for about 20 people at Calle Ocho
Never again
The restaurant was practically empty and they were not very attentive
They also didn't credit me for the deposit I left way in advance without rigorous follow-up on my part
This is not an honorable restaurant
The food was very mediocre
I won't be back
This is one of my all time favorite restaurants
The restaurant has great atmosphere: fun, lively, loud
They have a bar/lounge in the front and seat you in the back
But of course, the food is what makes this a great place
They start you off with yucca cheese bread that are hot, crunchy and soft
I've had it at other places, and they don't compare
Whether you get meat or fish, you can' go wrong
There are 1 or 2 vegetarian dishes, but the sides platter has a bit of everything, so you get the full flavor of Latin American food
They have a really cool little lounge area in the front that is great for drinks and munchys with friends
The restaurant in the back is pretty big with a kinda retro cool decor
The service was great, they ck your coats without charge, except for tip that is
For appetizers, the Chicharron-Crispy Calamari was really good and the Gallitos - Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos with Grilled Beef, Shrimp Enchilado Chipotle Chicken was to die for
(however, it says for 2 but 6 would be more like it!)
The Mariscos Ceviches was to die for (but was small, good for just 1)
For the entree I had the Paella - Lobster, Mussels, Clams, Shrimp, Scallops, Chorizo, Chicken, Tomato-Calamari Salad and it was wonderful, but there was no possible way to finish the whole thing, they really give you alot of food for the entree, but it was just as good the next day reheated! I had the Calle Ocho Tropical Daiquiris and it was really yummy
For dessert we had the Caramelo Flan, that was okay, not bad, but not the best
I had dinner with a friend and his wife and the dinner was great
There are some unusual items on the menu like the salted popcorn that comes with appetizes and the Yucca potatos that come with some of the meals, foo foo drinks, but overall, I enjoyed everything about this place
If you make a reservation, you are seated quickly, service is prompt and polite and the food is great! Rack of lamb, Cuban sirloin and snapper are awesome!
I chose to have my birthday dinner at Calle Ocho this past Saturday night
I'd been here before and knew what to expect
So I just sat back and watched the rest of my group enjoy
We were seated right away in a tucked away table (party of 7), the waitress was fun and spunky and the food
the whole group could NOT stop raving
Everyone was MORE than happy with my choice for dinner and I think we will be having many more dinners here in the future
This was a great restaurant
The service was excellent, the food was to die for and the ambience topped it off
In a great area of manhattan, this place is superb for Latin food
My family is hispanic and they knew what they were doing
I think it's great for couples, groups, special occasions! I was impressed and now it's one of my new favorite restaurants in NYC!
Calle Ocho was so good!! The bar/loungy area and the dining room are really cool, the mojitos are unreal, portions are a good size and the food is superb
All entrees are a good value and the service was excellent
it's definately worth checking out!
The mohitos make the plaace
food is excellent, but as expected, more latin fusion than anything else
not too romantic though if you come in a group
the booths are great
Overall it was a solid restaurant pick for a birthday dinner
The high ceilings and other decor was simple yet elegant and the lighting was just right for good conversation
Food was consistently good as well, but as most of all, the bread was a success
The skirt steak w/ egg was not exceptionally good but more than average
Portions were good
I was surprised by the small ice cream dessert from the restaurant to the birthday girl free of charge, but if they're going to give a nice service the one ice cream scoop on a stick didn't leave a strong enough impression
The mojitos were comparable to the best I've had
Still a very good dining experience
Cozy ambience
Gets crowded but is still spacious and you won't feel like sardines
Most excellent part of the meal were the ceviches and drinks
Others have claimed the ceviche was overpowering, but I found no such problem and the seafood was exquisite
Main course was less thrilling--unfortunately the service seemed a little rushed as they brought it to us within seconds of clearing our appetizers
Flan was too rich for my taste--perhaps it was a different kind than the style I am accustomed to
Next time may just go to the bar and try some more of their cocktails/appetizers

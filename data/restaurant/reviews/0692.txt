Wine selection as always top of the line, especially for the price and area
But the service is lacking and borders on rude
It is hard to digest when faced with rude blank stares of the young men and women barely able to stay awake in the dim atmosphere of the restaraunt
If it was snooty it would be somewhat understandable but most of the staff simply dont care
I have had my last supper at supper
This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots
I don't usually go there over the weekends or during prime dinner hours--but for a weekday dinner it's great, and I've never had any problems with crowds, waiting, or bad service
I've always found the waistaff to be friendly, down-to-earth, and always willing to translate or explain menu items
The food is exceptional--the highest quality ingredients executed with simple brilliance
The daily specials are especially good, and try the minimalist homemade fettucine dishes
Maybe our mistake was to go on a Friday night? We waited nearly 2 hours for a table! We were expecting a long wait but not that
The bar next door that the door people suggest waiting in is cramped and uncomfortable but the bartender was nice and the wine was reasonable
As for the food, it was good but nothing to rave about
We had 2 kinds of crostini, beet salad (a winner) a type of ravioli, fettucine, chicken, tiramisu and chocolate sorbet (ok, I'll rave about that)
The long wait and the attitude of the door girl is not justified by the just ok food
The menu looked great and the atmosphere is rustic and inviting, but the communal tables can be the worst
We were seated in the restaurant (which is two levels) at around 7:30 and told that there was no way we could sit by ourselves (there is only one table for 2 in the entire place) we were seated at the communal table, which was fine if you dont mind being on top of each other, until the girl sitting much too close to us started smoking
I kindly asked the waitress if there was a non smoking section, but she said the whole restaurant was smoking and there was no way we could change our seats
we left, too bad because the menu looked great
I guess if smoking during dinner and sitting on top of strangers doesn't bother you this place could be great
I recently spent a month in Italia
This place has the most wonderful authentic meals
I highly reccommend
It's very inexpensive and a lot of fun for groups
Just make sure everyone is in your party is there together or you'll be waiting on the sidewalk or in the cramped bar next door
The Scene Fifty years ago, the original Flamingo Room ruled the roost from the Waldorf-Astoria, but there's still a bit of Havana-meets-high-society to be found at this reincarnation
Dining for less than $40 gives this supper club a leg up in Manhattan's most over-loungified neighborhood
And although a Cohiba cigar won't fly in the luxe deco interior--a vision in stainless steel and pink from the owners of El Flamingo--mojitos and caipirinhas will
The Food Staff in crisp white jackets serve a wide selection of traditional Latin entrees, spiked with exotic sides like yucca and plantains, as well as starters from the delicious raw bar
A moist filet of salmon is double-charred and served on a purple mound of beet-stained couscous, while a tender filet mignon gets some kick from foie gras butter and mashed potatoes laced with white truffles
My husband and I hosted an informal wedding reception for +/- 40 guests in the bar area; something I recommend for any small to mid sized group! Stationed appetizers were served, and we had a champagne toast
The service was great, the bartender was attentive and friendly, and the music (level and type) were just right
over the summer i was in South Beach on Colins and Ocean Ave i loved the music the excitement and the deco ambiance that can only be found in South Beach
until now from the moment my date and i walked into the flamingo room i felt i was back in South Beach the music , the excitement were all there but this was better it had a feeling of class and old world charm that i have never experienced i have never seen such attention to detail from the decor to the waiters unique uniforms all the way down to the custom flamingo room plates and can you believe this they even had flamingos on their silverware this place is unbelieveable i can't wait to go back
The Flamingo room was amazing
I felt like I was in the mist of Miami w/ the Tall Palm trees pink walls
the Bistro is to die for
It's a mix of Latin Italian - My two favorites
It's a must
Bring the girls, b/c there are always cutties there
I took my lady there last sat and had a wonderful meal
The service was not so great, no specials read to us, and ignored us during our meal
Luckily the food was unreal
Place is great, dessert was good, I had the fried bannanas
My girl was so happy I brought her that she made it a special weekend!
We had a great meal on Friday night, the servive was excellent too
Highly recommended!!
the food was delicious, I definitely racommend the soft polenta with mushroom and the whole branzini the service was wonderful and extremely attentive we will definitely be returning
just amazing
the best lobster spagheti and the branzini out of this world keep the secret
the food is heavenly
the service are impecable i have no word for osteria thank you
The food was very average and was not worthy of the prices
There are many better options in this restaurant rich neighborhood
The kicker was when there were three items on our check that were priced higher than stated on the menu and by the server
Suspect
The only positive is the setting and location
The food was fresh, but the preperation was pedestrian
Expensive for what it is and very average
Do yourself a favor and pass
The dcor is simple but elegant, lighting is dim enough to add to the romantic ambiance but you can still see what you are eating
Mosaic top tables are cute but a little to small
Our wine arrived chilled to perfection, but was not put on ice
I would have normally request the wine to be put on ice but it was so good and the breeze from the open panels was just right and I enjoyed the company of my date so much that the wine disappeared before it had a chance to warm up
She ordered the risotto, and I the fried fresh sardines over a bed of arugula
Sardines were fried golden brown but with a little to much breading, arugula was fresh and tangy
Overall, Osteria Del Sole is a cute little romantic place but it may be too romantic for a first date
Live in the neighborhood
Food is good but not fabulous, however, I would still recommend this place
The service is excellent, ambience pleasant and appropriately priced
The waiter was very attentive and friendly
Some things are better than others on the menu
The orange watercress salad and gnocci with mushrooms were excellent, the fettucini with veal ragu and white fish with asparagus were solid
Took my parents here for their anniversary and I'm glad I did
The hostess was very nice and gave us lots of attention
The food was wonderful, had the ribbon pasta with duck sauce, very tasty! All six people at my table loved their food
The decor was elegant; size of the place is relatively small, but still comfortable
Will definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood
I had a wonderful dinner here not long ago
the boar was delicious! The staff was very friendly and very accomodating
The wine selection was perfect, and the beet salad was really good [and I'm not usually big on beets, lol]
The desserts are very good as well
I would definitely go back!
I took business colleagues to this restaurant as it received a high rating on city search
The food was very disappointing at pizzeria style level - pasta was not fresh and the lobster in the pasta very chewy
The service was good but will not go back here
My boyfriend took me last saturday to his favorite italian restaurant in the city (Osteria del Sol)
What a great treat it was
Since we got in, we were courteously greeted from the hostess and enjoyed a great mojito that the very friendly bartender made
The food was great
I had the gnoci with wild boar and my boyfriend let me have some of his suckling pig
Oh, it was so good and the service was phenomenal
Our waiter was so funny and soo cute and the bus-boy was always smiling
Everybody in Del Sol was so friendly
They made us feel just like home
I will definitely go back!
you must go here!! went to osteria del sole last week after seeing the review on city search  best italian food from the minute I walked in my date and I were greeted warmly from the coat check girl to manager the feeling was absolutely wonderful from the moment we arrived
the food was incredible so many choices and specials the food was so good we could stop eating
I never seen cleaner plates beein taken away!!!! I saw loads of celebrity ,but they treat as well like we are
everything about osteria del sole is spectacular

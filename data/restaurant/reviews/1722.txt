I know that it will never dissapoint you
In Short Since first opening in 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill
, McDonald's has become one of the most recognized brands in the world
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
from the legendary Big Mac to new and exciting menu items like Chicken Parm and the Big Extra Mickey D's is always expanding their menu! where else can you get a full dinner for $5 bucks? a burger, some fries and a nice big Coke, it's the American dream meal!! just count your blessings that there is a Mickey D's on every corner in America! we are the luckiest people in the World!
i've been working in midtown for a few weeks and have yet to find a decent bagel
while these are far from the best, they are also far from reasonably priced
The prices change day to day according to who is working and which way the wind blows
If you like being herded through the line and paying top dollar for a bagel this is the place for you
Pick-a-bagel is mediocre at best!! Their bagels are often hard and their spreads and fillings are often not very fresh
If you want real, hot, soft bagels, head to Avenue N bagels in Brooklyn! You won't be disappointed!
I've been giving these guys a second, third, fourth
chance for two years now
Not anymore
If you don't loose a tooth on the bagels, you'll loose your lunch on how much you'll spend on it
If you're looking for a simple bagel and coffee, do yourself a favor and get the best bagels (and bargain) in the US from your local streetcorner bagel cart
These bagels are awesome! The seven grain bagels are perfect! They use country butter which is nice and creamy
The service is nice and friendly although you sometimes have to give your order more than once for them to understand but they are getting better with that each time I go
Nice addition to the area
This diner, while it may have a great range of food, the quality of the service, both in how they serve and lengthy waits is apalling
My food arrived one hour after ordering and the quality of the meat was tough and badly cooked
It's hard to get American diner food wrong in this town
The Scene Glossy locals mix with tourists drawn by Flay's Food Network shows in a long, rather narrow room brightened by colorful Cubist wallpaper
Casual diners eat from the tapas menu at the long bar--if they arrive soon enough to secure a seat
Waiters give excellent advice on sherry pairings (more than 30 brands in stock)
The Food Flay's trademark strong flavors are usually as loud as his mouth, but here they find a more subdued and intricate expression
Tapas, served four at a time in small white porcelain trays, are a highlight--salt cod fritter stuffed with parsley-garlic sauce melts in the mouth, while pan-fried duck liver sits in a rich mix of sherry vinegar, honey and black pepper
Plump, juicy grilled octopus in a lemon and garlic oil broth is an excellent appetizer; pork tenderloin marinated in walnuts and caramelized figs and wrapped up sushi-style is remarkably tender and subtle
The standout here is the customer service
Our waiter was excellent
Had the black ink squid risotto which was delicious
Many flavors, vibrant colors
the restaurant itself has a bit of a tacky decor
Saw the tapas (4 for $16) and they looked really small
my risotto dish was a generous portion, complete with prawns, and lobster
yum! Not a fan of Bobby Flay, but I would come back to his restaurant
Perfectly cooked on a beautiful roll, with delicious cheese
I craved this the most while pregnant with my duaghter!!!!
Went here to celebrate our anniversary, had a wonderful experience, friendly staff, sensational food, great atmosphere, good wine and great drinks, can't wait to go back
Bolo has been on our try it list for awhile and we're just sorry we didn't move it up sooner!!
Went to this high end spanish tapas place for a 2nd time
First off, I had no idea that this was Flay's place, so I went with no preconceived notions or expectations
I had the almond grilled chicken and my girlfriend had a few tapas
The tapas were very good (albeit tiny) but the almond chicken tasted like school cafeteria breaded chicken breats
In a town with so many hits and misses, Bolo is an absolute hit! From A-Z this place was awesome
I took my wife (a spectacular Spanish cook, herself) for her birthday and we we blown away
The flatbread was great, the lamb shank was the best I've ever had (even better than my Greek Grandmother's!!)
We had an appetizer, bottle of decent wine, 2 dinners and dessert and with the tip the bill was under $150
There are so many expensive misses in the city that its great to find a fabulous hit!!
From the wine, to the appetizers, entree and dessert - everything was great
Although the appetizer and desser portions are kind of small but worth it
With the entree it is just enough to fill you up
Highly recommend this place
We had a large party and the staff took very good care of us
Our waiter was fabulous and the food was delicious
The sauce that accompanied my duck was mouth-watering
I found the prices to be quite high, while the flavor an interest of the dishes to be quite low
No interesting combinations of flavor or techniques
The taste bud/$ equation was simply way off the mark
We were worried about all the hype because of Bobby Flay's t
v
show,but had an awesome experience
The food was incredible and the wait staff was top notch
Really good tapas and the apple tart for dessert is to die for!!!
My girlfriend took me here after an episode of Boy Meets Grill
When we were being seated, Bobby Flay (chef) came out and spoke with the guests and the staff (something he did continuously throughout our evening)
It was very exciting but most exciting was the amazing meal we were introduced to
The tapas are a must - the 7 layer potato, pork tenderloin and the squid were amazing
Paella and the whole fish were out of this world
For dessert we argued over whose was better - her apple tart or my chocolate ganache bread pudding
Our waitress was terrific, never were we hurried - we were allowed to relax and enjoy for 2 1/2 hours on a friday night! And what can you say about Chef Flay - this is a great restaurant
Having to wait 30 minutes for our order to be taken set the tone for the evening, while all of the food was quite tasty (particularly the grilled octopus), the food and service did not match the prices
For what they charge, go to Gramercy Tavern or USQ Cafe, leave this place to the tourists and Bobby Flay groupies
We enjoyed a lunch at Bolo during January's restaurant week
Found the food to be above average to excellent, particularly the mussels in a creamy tarragon broth, and the chickpea polenta topped with salmon tartare
The Sangria was super, the service excellent, the restaurant warm (heat wise - it was freezing that week) and the ambience inviting
We recommend
I have been to Bolo in the past and was disappointed to see how far it has fallen on a recent visit
The food (even the soup) was lukewarm and most of the flavor seemed to come from the copious amounts of oil poured onto the dishes
The service was brusque and inattentive
Maybe Bobby should spend less time on TV and a bit more keeping the restaurant in shape
This was the most hyped mediocre meal I have had in NYC
I never believed in Ghosts until my waiter dissapeared
the Menu looks great but the food is subpar
It is a nice room with a cool bar and you should stop in for a drink and Tapas but dinner was very weak!!!! I even complained to the manager and no response
By the way the menu is really well priced
However, the service is terrible
I took my sister, visiting from California, to Bolo for a birthday dinner
We were seated immediately; tended to by a charming waiter named Carlos Richter; and had a wonderful meal with a tasty bottle of wine
The special raspberry torte was obscenely delicious! It was an enjoyable and relaxing repast for both of us
I will be recommending this restaurant to friends
the tapas are delicious and our well-informed and amiable water helped us match them with sherrys from the restaurant's extensive list
(forget what you thought you knew about sherry! who knew there were sherries as dry as a pinot grigio and served cold rather than room temperature!?!)
three cheers for the foie gras, crab and beef carpaccio
also had a delicious stacked beefsteak tomato salad
sounds boring but it was surprisingly interesting and flavorful
pass on the cod--bland and boring
but the pork was divine

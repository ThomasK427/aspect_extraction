This city has a lot of good steakhouses, and it is a mystery to me why everyone swears by this one
Its great to be anonymous and non-politically correct
Hands down, the BEST STEAK anywhere, Peter Luger borders on a carnivorous religion
Having been to most of the steakhouses in and around NYC (and elsewhere), I feel confident in saying that Peter Luger is the best of the bunch
All of the distractions that you find at other steakhouses - numerous cuts, large menus, fancy decor - are set aside in order to focus on the ultimate steak dinner
Go with somone who's been there before so you don't have to ask for a menu (which is Luger blasphemy)
And if you can't tell the difference between this and an Arthur's steak, then I am truly sorry for you - I suggest a taste bud transplant or eating all future meals at the nearest McDonald's, because there is no comparison
The food is great
I can't stand the fact that half of the customers feel the need to dress like slobs
Is it too much to ask to at least make an effort to look presentable when going out for dinner
If you are a steak-lover, you will be in a gluttonous heaven
The numbness in your lower legs from sitting on old wood chairs is more than compensated by the wonderful food
Get the bacon (best ever, hands down) and shrimp cocktail to start and steak for how many ever to finish
I'd heard a lot about this place, but wasn't totally prepared for the whole experience
The side dishes are pretty good, but the steak is what you come here for
And - the waiter was friendly! -- I was expecting the waiter to ignore us and be rude, but he had a quick smile and was accomodating
Definitely go with someone who's been before
and it helps to have a P
L
credit card
Don't plan on walking up, you'll need a reservation
And bring plenty of cash as they don't take credit cards
To sum it up, the steak is indeed the best out there, but the servers and especially the hosts are big time jerks
Just because you have the best steak in the world and everyone wants to eat it still doesn't give you a right to be jerks about it
Who the hell do these people think they are?
When we made our reservation we were called three times to confirm, but they never mentioned they don't accept credit cards
The waiter was rude, and the steak was over-aged and tasted awful
I won't go back
At almost $70/person with a glass of wine, the food is overrated
The steak is great but isn't better than steaks from other great steak places that are a little cheaper
Its not that I didn't like the steak but I didn't love it
I go to restaurants for the ambience and service as well as the food
Frankly Peter Lugar's needs a facelift
Its decor isn't any better then say TGI Friday's or Outback
The plates and silverware looked like they were perchased when PL's first opened
It seems like its living off of its reputation from yester year - I was disappointed
The best thing about Peter Lugar's is the steak sauce and as luck would have it you can buy that at your local grocery store
Four for dinner, the special was porterhouse for four, we ordered medium rare, what arrived was two t-bones blackened from flames
Not an appealing meal, I do better at home!
Maybe it was the build up from everybody telling me if you like steak you have to go to Peter Luger's
Well it wasn't worth it
The steak was good but I've had much better
I've even had much better for much less
You are better off saving your money and going to Arthur's
The one good thing I can say is that they were understanding when our party was a 1/2 hour late for our reservations due to traffic
Traffic, yet another reason not to go
Great classic steak house
We were pleasantly surprised with the good service ( and menu) that was made available to us
The porterhouse steak was great
The sides were pretty good
IF YOU EVER WANTED TO EAT A STEAK THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO TO
THE FOOD AND SERVICE ARE FAR ABOVE MANY WHO SAY THEY ARE THE BEST
THE FOOD EVEN THOUGH A LITTLE PRICEY IS JUST INCREDIBLE FROM APPETIZERS TO DESSERTS
ALWAYS MY FAVORITE
This is one of the best steak houses in the area, it is a old classic
Forget all the fancy new menu's when you just want a good steak and creamed spinich
this is were you should go
nothing fancy just a darn good steak
If you're not looking for a pretentious atmosphere and a restaurant that serves the best steak you've ever eaten
then this is the place for you
The porterhouse melts in your mouth and fills your entire pallet with amazing flavors
Granted, the service is course
but its all part of the atmosphere
If you want to be spoiled with service and attention then this is not the place for you
The steak was great
Any fan of beef must try the steak here
The jumbo shrimps are just that, no false advertisement
For those of you who like pork the canadian bacon is the best slice of pork heaven
Unless you love slices of tomatoes and onions, you can pass on the self explanitory dish
To answer the big question of how the waiters are, the one we had was a gentlman about 5' 10 ish with sandy blonde hair
He was the most courteous waiter we've ever had at any steakhouse
So, all those rumours about nasty waiters can be put to rest
The ambiance is old school steakhouse and they shouldn't change a thing about it
It takes guts to keep things the same for over a century
Book way in advance
If you want old school NY service and a great steak, this is the place to be
The bacon and spinach are also great
Don't expect to be pampered here and the price is right if you compare it to Manhattan steak houses
the best steak ive ever eaten
crispy on top, tender, hi quality, order spinach too! to those who dont like this food then u might better off dead cause u cant enjoy the good things and bad things in this universe
also, they have very low taste
trust me with this
peterludger rule!
Top steakhouses are what they are
They aren't elegant
They aren't cheap
I've been to most in NY and recently went to Luger's
I was a bit worried after reading the reviews
I found the steak and sides to be the best of the big steakhouses
I like the no frills decor, and thought the service was fine and relatively friendly
Don't go to Luger's if you are looking for elegance and refinement, but don't go to Sparks, the Palm or any of the others either
our waiter spilled an entire glass of water on my brother and didn't so much as acknowledge it, let alone apologize
the steaks are mediocre, the steak sauce is sickeningly sweet and the wait is way too long, even with a reservation
i don't need to deal with it when i'm paying a fortune for it
Only a true steak lover can look past the decor and location, and truly enjoy this place for what it serves: the best steak in the world
Bacon and shrimp cocktail appetizers, Porterhouse for number of people seated +2, hash browns, cream spinach and the Holy Cow Sundae
Don't know why you would order anything else
A true health concern if it were not all the way in Brooklyn
We went to the one in Long Island and were not impressed
Steak was good but not much else to order

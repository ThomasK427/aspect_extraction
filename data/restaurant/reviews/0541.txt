These people know how to cook! Even the rice and beans are above average
It does not matter what part of the city you are traveling from, it is most definitely worth the trip
Take home the leftovers, order a couple extra tamales
You won't regret it
A hidden treasure in the upper east
My friend and I had the chicken fajitas, which were pretty good
The quacamole and salsa were excellent and the sangria was decent
It was a good value and I will definately be back
My only gripe was that it was filled with loud families with uncontrolled kids running about
I used to live up by El Toro Partido and ate there often
The food was almost always EXCELLENT
You wouldn't expect much looking at it
it's tiny and unassuming
but once I tried it I was hooked
This is not your usual bean-loaded-super-melted-brown--red overpriced-gringo-Tex-Mex
This is open faced corn tacos (ala ones I had in the Distrito Federal) with limes, tomatillo sauce and radish on the side, this is THE REAL DEAL
True Mexican
The Huevos Rancheros are super, Veggie options are suprisgingly lavished with fresh broccoli and corn
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga
Tinga is soft, stewed chicken meat with onions, on top of a crispy tostada covered in fresh lettuce, avacado and crumbled white cheese
I'm salivating
Having moved I truly miss this place
The only thing that comes close is the La Taqueria in Park Slope
but Toro Partido is HALF the price!
The Dosais could not be brought hot as we tried a couple of times -dont know why
The thali, though overpriced was good enough except for the roti which was bad
Waiters are hurried but one guy was helpful
Owner doesnt interact much -there is no personalised touch or anything
If trying for the first time, go for lunch than dinner since its cheaper
The Dosas are good
The Bhatura-Channa is good
Although the thali is good, i feel it is overpriced
Go for the small thali and don't forget it is unlimited so top it up when you are done
The service needs to improve
An item we ordered was not fully cooked once
We sent it back and got it nicely made after 20 mins
We will go back for dosa and bhatura only
Good value for these items
Best dhosa in NY
As a South Indian, I am very picky about Indian food
The food served is authentic, freshly prepared, and great attention is placed on the ingredients and condiments
This includes both the South and North Indian dishes
They are friendly and aim to please
A face lift, specifically, bringing light into the restaurant would help a great deal for the ambience
The food is affordable and reasonably priced
The service could be faster
Knowing that each item is being freshly prepared and arrives steaming hot helps the wait
Preference is NOT given to regulars or individuals carrying thick wallets (in reference to the first review)
We as a group went in to this place-all students-the service sucked, we waited for a dosa for an hour, customers who came after us were served faster becos the waiter saw them as regulars who would bring back more customers
We swore we never would step in again and the waiter lost a good hefty tip
Advice-unless you can brag at your table and project yourself as someone with a hefty wallet dont even go to this place
The best dosa I have had outside India
Often the quality of a South Indian restaurant is seen in the chutney
Saravans Bhavan had the best and freshest tasting chutney
The ambiance was reasonable for an Indian place
The service was prompt and friendly
Eat there!
i can only vouch for my favorite dishes: egg drop soup, dumplings and general tso's chicken
delicious
and i have been around the block, to say the very least
friends/family have sampled other choices on the menu and have found them to their taste/enjoyment
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone

Looked up on citysearch
figured try a new place in Chinatown, HUGE, I MEAN HUGE MISTAKE
The food was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually
The service was typical short-order, dinner type
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES)
But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations
I was wandering the streets of chinatown one day and got lost
now this restaurant is a bit off the beaten path
It's not on the main busy streets but on Elizabeth street
SO I decided to give it a try and the food was amazing!! I had the best meal ever in chinatown
I tried their famous dumplings and also softshell crabs as they advertised and I was very satisfied and happy
The prices are really reasonable as well
Parking was easy too! there's a garage right next door! And if you have ever been to chinatown, parking is REALLY HARD TO FIND
The only downsides of this restaurant is that it isn't big and the decor
The service and quality of food is 10 out of 10
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here! The skin of the dumplings are made fresh here and you can tell b/c it melts in your mouth! The fried rice is amazing here
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste
other than the excellent dimsum (personal favorite: shrimp dumplings), this little joint also has great soup (egg drop soup lovers, rejoice!) and other regular menu items (another personal favorite of mine, general tso's chicken here, IMHO, is the best in NYC! and i've been around the block
) in short: trendoids looking for 'great ambience' and celebrity sightings, as well as germophobes wearing surgical masks in public, may want to look elsewhere
fans of very tasty, yet cheap, authentic chinese food will love it
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces
That's good and bad
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good
I have been going to this place for years now and one thing that is consistent is its great food and cheap prices
Their Juicy Buns are second only to Joe's Shanghai in my opinion but their pan fried dumplings definitely top Joe's
This is also 'the' place for Shanghai styled pan fried noodles
So if you don't want to wait long lines for your dumplings and want to eat like the locals do, definitely give this place a try
Don't let its inconspicuous location fool you - within you will find fast, friendly service and some of the most succulent dumplings around
Embark on the search and it will be well worthwhile
Food is great! Try their juicy dumplings, they are one of the most delicious dumplings I've ever had

HOWEVER
they are not gluten-free
Nothing here is truly gluten-free
They use spelt flour, which is highly glutinous, in some of their products and there is definitely cross contamination with the supposedly gluten-free items
I'm not even that sensitive to gluten (only gluten intolerant, not celiac) and their products cause a negative reaction
I really don't get the fuss about the cupcakes - Think Duncan Hines store bought mix in terms of texture and taste
Nothing special
Happy Happy Happy's (just a couple blocks north) cupcakes, especially their icing, are a million times better and their facility and ingredients are 100% gluten-free and dairy-free and 70% of their items are vegan
Wheat-free and gluten-free cupcakes
What a concept?! I tried the vanilla gluten-free cupcake top and found it to be a bit strange in texture however, it wasn't sweet nor was the icing and I found the two to be complimentary to one another
The icing is a bit like gum or a strange fondant from another planet but worth trying
$1
25 well spent for something different
i have spent the better part of the last ten years hunting down ANY and EVERY cupcake in the greater NY area
the famous, not so famous and everything in between
had previously avoided babycakes cuz the idea of cupcakes sans sugar/egg/dairy/gluten just sounded
well, wrong
having now tried them, however, i will gladly acknowledge my mistake: these cakes are DIVINE and so is everything else there
i strongly strongly strongly recommend that you do NOT make the same mistake: get thee to babycakes NOW
cake: moist (unbelievably so!) and flavorful
frosting INSANELY good -- totally defies description and cannot be compared to any that you have ever had (trust me, you have NOT had a frosting like this before -- by virtue of its composition alone -- can you say agave sugar?)
GO
NOW
ignore all the other cupcakes down in that area and everywhere else
I would strongly recommend this place
After trying numerous Indian Restaraunts around the city I have to say that this one is with a doubt my favorite
the people are nice, the restaraunt is nice, and most importantly, the food is incredible
Eat there, and try the Lamb Pasanda
I'm no Indian (jew actually) but this place is stellar!!!
The coffee is good but the sandwiches are great
They have a huge backyard with a mammoth sized picnic table and a wodden mule for kids to sit on
Inside had nice dark wood and a western inspired bar with a lot of iron work
I want to second everything said by the first reviewer
This is the best cafe I've been to in Brooklyn, perhaps in all of New York City
Excellent sandwiches and soups, great coffee drinks and staff that serves them, free wireless internet, lovely backyard garden, and wonderful dark wood decor inside
I know they are getting a liquor license soon, and I just hope the place doesn't change too much because of that
Wonderful place to sit, read, eat, caffeinate, think, write, chat, etc
Also a block and a half from the Atlantic Ave
/Pacific St
station
I have been a regular fixture at Mule since it's opening earlier this year, and I must say, it has every other coffee shop in the area beat by a mile
Located on 4th Ave in the Park Slope / Boerum Hill hinterland, this spot is a standout
The name is apt and clever, since the coffee works as hard as a mule, government or otherwise
The menu has everything you need for a fresh tasty snack or a solid, well priced lunch (sandwiches on delightful artisan bread are key)
But really it's the employees that keep me coming back
In contrast to other places I've been in the area, these folks are intelligent, but unpretentious, courteous, engaging, and downright hot
Also, the patrons are pretty much hipster-free
Abandon your pre-conceived notions about coffee shops
It's Mule, or it's a bust
Three of us walked in at 3 PM on Friday (3/24/06) to a nearly empty restaurant
After asking the waiter for a few minutes to look over the menu, we had to call out several times over 15 minutes to get him to come back to our table
After some confusion about no substitutions (we wanted a slice of cheese on an omelette instead of a side of bacon - how hard is that?), we waited 40 minutes for an omelette, a burger, and a caesar salad! After 20 minutes and a lot of angry glares, the waiter finally found out that they were out of fries
When we finally got our orders, there were so little fries on our plates, it was laughable and the burger was cold
Never again! This placed sucked!
Whether you want a high-cholesterol salt festival or a healthy, clean dinner, this place has anything you want in a diner
The prices are a little Meatpacking District, but you can't really complain
It's upscale comfort food, as they say
The macaroni and cheese is the best I've ever had
Add the chorizo if you dare!!! After a workout, the chicken sandwich is really satisfying when you're trying to resist fries
I had the veggie burger and my friend had the triple layered grilled cheese
both were really great, the french fries are awesome, drinks aren't overpriced and the scenery is cute, like an old diner you'd see in a small town
i had a great time and our waiter (apparently he is the manager, but was covering for someone?) was absolutely terrific! the only issue i had was that the hostess was incredibly rude
We simply asked to be seated away from the door (there were 4 tables out of about
well maybe 20 full) and she rolled her eyes at us and said fine, whatever, stormed to the table and slammed our menus down and left! luckily the the waiter was really great so that made up for it
i am a little hesitant to go back on a date or something
I have never seen a manager speak so rudely and condescendingly to both his employees and myself, as the customer
It ruined my whole dining experience
The food was average
Went to THE DINER after work with friends
What fun we had! We tried the meat loaf,mac and cheese,steak sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs
all comfort food
One of us even had a milk shake
Staff was very anxious to please
The decor is so RETRO
We will all go back again
Average food served with a snotty attitude
There is nothing redeeming about this place aside from it's shiny exterior
A Diner it is not
Just what the neighborhood didn't need
Another restaurant where everything is a production
As a resident in the neighborhood it was sad to see Nicks go, only to be replaced with a meatpacking version of a diner
So out of place
just open a johnny rockets
at least you'd get an ok burger
Service was great
waiter was on top of it!   Now the food
well that was disappointing at best - bad is another way to put it
I had a Chicken Caesar Wrap and there was almost no chicken
Basically a wrap filled with lettuce
Mom had a grilled cheese
it was plain American cheese, no butter on the bread, and a couple slices of tomato
Nothing special
The fries were EXACTLY like the fries at Burger King! The one positive was the onion rings - They were good
Sodas were small and refills were not free - we paid $3
00 each for two diet cokes
Two seperate parites came in to sit next to us and left after looking at the menu
Not a big selection and sorta pricy
The bad food is not worth the good service and cute decor
Hope these waiters find themselves another job before this place closes
I've been to The Diner a few times

But we were a group of 5, not 6, yet they tacked on a 20% gratuity -- after tax! We raised this with the waitor, who said he was the manager, and he said that's just the way we do it
Well, friend, you just lost our business
They were utterly rude
There were people waiting at the door to get tables, yet they took for ever to bring us our bill
(The service was slow all night long
) The food itself was excellent, but unfortunately, the rest of the experience was so bad I coulnd't recommend it to anyone
After some good food and spotty service, my friends and I were surprised to get a bill that had a 20% tip included post-tax
When we brought the mistake to our waiter's attention--not only were we a party of five (automatic tips started with parties of 6), but tip is calcuated pre-tax-- he got extremely rude
There are too many other good restaurants to waste your money on such lousy service
I celebrated my girlfriends b-day here with the family
Food is great we had appetizers that where enough for dinner
Seafood and ribs are highly recommended
Dessert was to die for
This place is awful
damn
its too hard to lie about this place
Its just that its the kind of place you want to keep on the DL
Amazing food,very reasonabled priced
The Chupe was so good I almost asked for one to take home
The Mussels a La Lima were quite possibly the best I've ever enjoyed
I'm almost certain you can't go wrong with any of the offered Ceviche
I have had the Lomo Saltado (fillet mignon), lamb stew, and the Aji De Pollo
The Aji De Pollo was one of the most tasteful ways I have ever consumed the often tired out chicken dish
It is amazing in color, texture and taste
The creamy yellow pepper sauce that smothers the chicken is unique and superb
It will almost certainly offer you a new taste that you will feen for
I can't wait to eat there again
I'm tempted not to share just how excellent this little place is because it's small and will become tougher to get into
everything we had was par excellence, seriously
No Peruvian place in Lima or the supposedly great outposts in Queens compares
My chupe de camarones was the essence of shrimp
The ceviches of tuna and of grilled shrimp/scallops were outstanding, and creative too as you couldn't easily find these varieties on a menu in Peru
On to the mains: we had the sudado (steamed fish in beer), totally flavorful, tho they sure are proud of it at $28 bones
My wife and her friend had the lomo saltado (they really did use filet in this dish) and a picante de mariscos which was excellent
on top of it all, the sangria was excellent
i love this place
This place was really just ok - went on a wed night it was fairly empty and they seated at the worst table inside - the food was mediocre - you can definitely find somewhere better to spend your money
went here with a girlfriend last night
we ordered the ceviche mixto (a mix of shrimp, white fish, mussels and baby octopus in a zesty marinade), ceviche caliente (shrimp and scallops in a bold, slighty spicy sauce over friend yuca), papa rellena (a mound of deep fried mashed potato stuffed with beef, raisins and olives), and cow heart anticucho
the food was surprisingly good and the prices were quite reasonable for such fresh seafood
the sangria was very tasty and pretty strong (so be careful!)
the only drawback was slow service but then again, there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant until around 10pm
i don't know how authentic it was but i plan on taking my peruvian friend back here!
I was very pleased with how quickly we were seated given that the dining area was very small
Sorry to say that as soon as we were seated, the night went downhill
It started off with the waiter spilling cups of water all over me with no apology being made, nor was a towel offered
The rest of the night was ruined by the inability of the staff to keep our orders straight
To top the night off, when our bill arrived (no comp was given-as expected) we noticed that we were overcharged
The food nor prices are astounding enough to sacrifice service
Having been there five times in the last two months, I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke
Simply put, great food in desirable serving sizes and sangria that kicks your ass the moment you stand up! The sangria alone is a great reason to go
You can truly sit, relax, and enjoy your meal with no rushing
It's never too crowded but there's a constant thrum of patrons
I went to Lima's expecting something like rice and beans, but was pleasently surprised with the great food
I had the Picante Seafood
It was good and spicy but did not overpower the fish
The seafood was very fresh
I sampled the Cerviche Tuna, which the marinade did overpower the fish, but I enjoyed it anyway
I would most likely try a different Cerviche the next time I visit
I would also like to see additional wine selection, maybe some more South American wines
I will definitely be back!
my friends and i wandered into anh when we didn't get seating at a nearby restaurant
the atmosphere is cozy and cute
they waited to get us water after they took our food orders, which took the waitstaff a long time to do
they definitely took their time getting the food out to us too, which is good and bad depending on if you have time
the food was pretty good, portions decent
we were all surprised that rice was extra
i'm asian and it's just customary that rice comes with the entree
and we all thought that the food was too salty
maybe they make it that way so you are forced to order rice
overall, it was still a nice experience
i would go back if i were in the area again, but the extra cost for rice might make me rethink twice
My boyfriend and I wandered into Anh on a whim
Knowing nothing about Vietnamese food, we asked our waiter to recommend some things
Everything we tried was delicious and the prices are very good
The setting and service are also nice
Try it, it's a gem in this otherwise boring part of town
This is probably the most upscale feeling Vietnamese restaurant I've been to in Manhattan
The decor was beautiful (somewhat cheesey perhaps but very clean)
The lighting was very dim, making it good for romantic dinners for couples
We were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, so it was very quiet - don't know how croweded this place can get
The appetizers were tastey but very small
The entrees were good: I had the pork chops, which were pan fried instead of grilled, giving it a different taste, and my friend a delicious sea bass stew served in a clay pot
Dinner for two was expensive compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, but I guess you're paying for the ambience
This place looks great with a courtyard fountain, but once inside we were seated in folding chairs that were too low for the table and shania twain was playing
The waitress nearly lost the cork in our wine, which it turned out had gone bad due to improper storage
After that we decided not to risk it with the food and cancelled our order to go down the street for tibetian food (which was good)
This restaurant has the worst service I have ever experienced
The waiters didn't speak English, the one that did couldn't get the order right, then when we asked to speak to the manager they told us that there was no manager and that they were all equally in charge
We left the restaurant hungry and very upset
I've been in NYC for 15 years and I rarely have the chance to get back to LA, where I grew up
I was happy to stumble across this tiny( but cozy) slice of home, hidden in the West Village
The food is excellent and quite a bargin for New York prices
I really enjoy the cholo worshipping decor and Lennard and I have been known to throw back shot after shot on a Saturday night
If it's a killer margarita or top-notch Mojito that you crave, look for Chockie, I think she works Fridays and Sundays and your mouth will thank you
Ralph and Rina are also a lot of fun and treat everyone just like family
Everytime I have someone from hom visiting, I bring them by for the LA kitch factor
The only complaint that I have is the music, as it's not unusual to hear the same song three times in one hour
I look forward to seeing you guys after I get back from vacation
The food is terrific; not your ordinary Mexican food, this is flavorful, well-seasoned, authentic

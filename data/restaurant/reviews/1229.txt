we also tried their sangria, which was really good- not overly sweet like many places
during the summer they have an outdoor section, and on some nights they have live salsa music
the owner was there when we went, and he was very nice and talked to us for quite some time about when the restaurant opened, etc, etc
i owuld highly recommend this place for a date and a good catching up conversation with a friend- the waiters are very discreet and know when you leave you alone, and they also are very attentive
the food was delicious too!
I was at Matador last weekend and was very taken by the atmosphere though the couple that we came with thought it was too busy! My guest felt that it was a bit too loud
They had live music and I could see what they meant
The energy was very high, it was buzzing, defenitely not your stuffy place
We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table but the hostess kept us in the loop
The food was great, the service was attentive
My only comment is that if you want a quiter place don't go to this restaurant on the weekends
The owner come to our table several times to see how we were doing, very nice
This place is defenitely fun but make sure your guests know that it's like a party before you go on weekends
I been going to Matador for a while now and it's only getting better, the food is consistanly great and they recently have added several new live music nights a week, I used to go on Saturdays for the killer Cuban band but noe they have an awsome Brazilian band that rocks and a Gypsy king type night
Super cool!! THis restaurants thinks out of the box, they don't just offer great food but a selection of great music treoughout the week
I also just discovered their lunch menu, if it's like their brunch menu it must be good too
Highly recommend this place
I been in Matador several times already and still it delivers the goods, I am happy to have this restaurant as one of my sure things whenever I take out clients I bring them to Matador and they love the food, the music, the energy, this helps me close deals, GREAT!! I took out my family for dinner this week and they all loved it, defenitely recommend it, enjoy it, I do
It was my birthday this weekend and my friends took me out to this restaurant on Greenwich Ave, what a great restaurant
The energy was great, they had a live band playing cuban music which was incredible, people were actually getting up and dancing, we were seating outside but we were going inside to get our music fix
The food actually is very delicious, everything I had was tasty, I had an incredibly whole red snapper that was to die for, the Sangria and mojitos also were great
I have to say that this restaurant was a great choice, they even had a celebrity sitting at the bar, a soprano guy, I truly recommend this restaurant, but plan ahead with the reservations, we saw alot of people walking in not getting a table because they were booked
4 of had dinner here last Saturday and we were all very disappointed with the food and the service
We ordered mojitos and were told 20 minutes later that they ran out of mint leaves
Ok, no big deal so we ordered Sangria for the table which took another 20 minutes to arrive
The food was ok but some items were awful like the green rice
To make matters worse an hour into our dinner we see a waiter take mojitos to another table
we asked our waitress why did she tell us they were none available
She didn't know what to say and just mumbled something about someone going out to buy more mint leaves (at 10pm?)
The waitress did try to get the manager to at least give us the Sangria on the house but the manager refused
I would be embarrassed to recommend this restaurant to anyone
My husband I went to Matador last week after reading all the favorable reviews
My sentiment is that this restaurant is just OK
The service was great -- the waiters were very friendly, approachable, and quick to offer suggestions
By 7pm there was a good-sized crowd, so it seems to be a popular place
In my opinion, though, there were 2 key things lacking -- the ambience (the interior was dull and uninspiring) and the quality of food for the price
We only had tapas
Some were pretty good -- the artichokes and meat/cheese plate
The others we tried were mediocre at best -- calamari (a heaping plateful with a strange pasty sauce) and bland tamales
We left the restaurant with a very oily taste in our mouths
Our total for the night was $80, which I felt to be expensive for the quality of food
I have been to Matador twice now and both meals have been amazing
The food is simply delicious and the service is excellent
Definitely a great find in the West Village!
I went with a big group for dinner and we had a blast
Such a fun restaurant for sangria, plates to share and lively ambience
The owners were friendly and attentive
Our waitress helped us pick out dishes for the table and kept the sangria flowing
And the food was delicious
I recommend it to all my friends looking for yummy Spanish food, a fun spot and the best sangria in town
Great for groups or a date
I really enjoyed my experience at Matador, the service and the food were outstanding
I left there with a smille on my face saying what a great little place
I will absolutely be back!!!
Today I ventured into the West Village in search of a good brunch, I found it, brunch at Matador!! The price was perfect $10 +, the food was delicious, their menu really was tasty, the music was cool too, but best of all was the included sangria mimosa!! THis must be the best thing going, great drinks, and great brunch, not your usual sub par brunch food but really gourmet brunch
Looking foward to ending up at Matador next weekend to eat that great food and drink my mimosa at their outdoor patio
Defenitely recommend it, they are giving it away!!
I had dinner with friends last week, I have to agree that this is a great restaurant
I truly had a fantastic time
The food was perfect, they do a fusion type spanish
It's not really traditional, the waiter explained it to me, he said that they are contemporary spanish fusion, blah, blah, blah,
THe point is that it was delicious
They had a Cuban band that sounded unbelievable!! Defenitely recommend it, I had brunch there this Sunday and it was very good, UNLIMITED SANGRIA!! Just don't blow up this spot, reservation is easy to get still
Great for a romantic evening or a party of 20+ (i've done both), Matador impresses
You'll be more than pleased with the atmosphere and the food, not to mention the incredible mojitos and red sangria (I hear the white is great too)
Go for a full dinner or just drinks and tapas
I've heard they're getting outdoor seating withing the next couple of weeks, too, which will make the great location and ambiance even better!
I was very impressed upon entering the front door to be greeted with such an embracing welcome by the staff and Owner
Food was Very flavorful with excellent wines and Sangria's to match
It is for people who like and appreciate a perfect, exciting and comfortable dining experience
Everything about this restaurant is perfect to the smallest details
Staff is extremely knowledgeable with elegant manners
The ambience is wonderful, its impossible to dine here and not leave in a great festive mood with there Live World Music bands! Perfect place for a date or for a group of friends
You'll never have a more heavenly evening!
We met a few friends here for a birthday and it was fabulous
The restaurant is new and the service and the food was amazing
Our waitress recommended our entire meal and we were more than satisfied
The restaurant has a great ambience and the 30's crowd was perfect for us
We went with a large group, but I definitely plan on going back for a nice romantic dinner also
Definitely try the sangria!
I went with a large group of friends and found teh food delicious and the service wonderful!
I was personnaly welcomed to the retaurant by the owner who ensured that my party ( of about 8 people) had a great time
The food is delicious like a home cooked meal but better! Definitely recommended!
My sister and I were wandering aimlessly through the WV for good Latin cuisine
We came across the festive yellow awning of Matador and decided to try out their brunch menu
We were absolutely delighted and pleasantly surprised with our whimsical choice
From the entrees to the service to the much-recommended Sangria!, Matador is a place not to be missed
The atmosphere is intimate whether with family, friends or that special someone
Also great for large gatherings! I highly recommend Matador and I know the most discerning critic will leave happy
my girlfriends and i went for happy hour during the week and had a great time
drinks are mixed perfectly, great music and the owner is hot
Definitely worth a visit
I just went to Matador for dinner tonight, Tuesday, and I have to say that I was blown away by the restaurant
What a cool place! I live not far but just recently discovered it and I am truly happy that I did
The food was amazing and I eat out all the time
They were having a Flamenco-Latin band which sounds great
My friends which are the incredibly hard to pleased all agreed that this is a great place
The service was on point, the drinks were great, I have to say this is the best Sangria I have ever had away from Spain
THe food was so delicious, I really am impressed by the caliber of this restaurant in my neighborhood
I'm made reservations for this Friday, they are having Brazilian night!!! Defenitely recommend it

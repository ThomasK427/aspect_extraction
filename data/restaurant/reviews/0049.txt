Each table is barbeque capable if you have an inkling for meat
Avoid the sushi and sashimi as Won Jo is a Korean restaurant first and foremost
There are many 24 hour choices on 32nd street past 2am but you can't go wrong with a visit to Won Jo
I went to most of the Korean restaurants in this area but WONJO happened to be the worst Korean restaurant I've ever been
I ordered Tempura dinner and it wasn't even crunch, instead it was saggie
My other dish supposed comed with soup, but I had to ask waiters more than 4 times to get it for me
When they brought it to me, it wasn't the one that usually comes with the dish
I had to send it back
Since I wasn't sure Tempura comes w/ rice, I told the owner that we didn't get the rice when we were about tos leave, he didn't even appolize about it, instead he bitter smiled at me
Pretty much saying I don't need your business, so whatever you say
and hurry and leave kind of attitude
I will never ever go back to that place again nor recommend to anybody!
Not the most beautiful environment, but the food is consistently delicious and the barbeque is fun and tasty
I recently met a friend at Won Jo to catch up
We had the most miserable dining experience! The wait staff rushed us through our meal, took away our food before we were finished (even though we told them we were still eating) and then, as we were lingering over the bill, asked us to leave
We were there less than an hour and there were other tables available (and no one waiting to be seated until moments before they asked us to leave)
I have never had such an unpleasant experience
If you want a leisurely meal, try one of the many other Korean places on 32nd street
The barbecued beef is delicious, as is the pork
I love Korean food and this place has some of the best BBQ around
And you can grill it at your table!!
Besides their unique wood grilled kalbi or bulgoki (bbq) I'm not too fond of their traditional Korean dishes
I've made some attempts during lunch for their prix fixe
Hwe do bop and nambeong were disappointing
I'd recommend Won Jo strictly for BBQ
If you want tastier Korean dishes head over to Dae Dong, Woo Chon, Hangawi, Kori and Togi
During lunch some of the Korean grocery shops had pre-made bento boxes, mandoo dumplings and bibimbop/ spicy noodle dishes for under $6
Which is handy if you don't want to blow your wallet on Korean restaurant can be pricy
Just take the pre-made bento and hike to AS top floor food court to eat
This place offers best lunch deal around
The Lunch menu is from $6 -12
And the food is great
Probably the best place to get good Korean food around the 'little Korea town' area in midtown, but don't count on getting spoiled by the staff
I hosted a birthday party there and it wasn't a pleasant experience
The service was terrible and the food was good but not good enough to make up for the service
The bulgogi (marinated chargrilled BBQ beef) here is the best
No ethnic foods are traditional in that the old countryfolks were often too poor to eat delicious food
But the food here is excellant and there are just too many appetizers (in the traditional custom of Korean restaurants) to sample
The clientele is often mainly non-Korean, which is a surprising but refreshing testament that the sometimes putridly pungent but wonderfully flavorful ethnic dishes are universally enjoyed
The soups are very authentic and rich
It's not located on the nicest street in Manhattan nor is it the nicest restaurant to eat in
But it is, to me, one of the best Korean BBQ spots in the city
The bulgogi was awesome, the service was fast and friendly and the food never stops coming
For the high price you would pay (dinner for the two could run $80), you sure do get alot
It's worth the money and worth a return
In Short Blue lights, fisherman's netting and rum-barrel tables set the room's tone
As Spanish guitar and flamenco music plays, a largely professional and creative crowd eats, drinks and talks it up
Tortilla espanola, the potato-omelette staple of any tapas bar, is as good here as it is in Seville
The mussels, garlic shrimp and jamon serrano are killer, while the creamy queixo cabrales--a regional Spanish blue cheese--makes a fine topper for the dense homemade bread
Xunta's tapas dishes were great though a little pricey for small plates
The only problem I have are with the seats! It's either long picnic benches you have to share with everyone or these too tall bar stools set around barrels being used for tables
There was no space to keep your drinks and plates and eating that high up was very uncomfortable
Come for the food, but don't expect to be comfortable
This is NYC and when it comes to food you do not need to suffer
The beauty of this city is that you can find excellent food at a good price
The food here was really bad
not mediocre but BAD
I was surprised to read any positive reviews
The fact that they have been in business for many years is surprising
It may be that the bar is decent and when you're drunk you're willing to eat pretty much anything
The waitstaff was fine but the manager/bartender was agressive and belligerent
I would be too if I worked at a dump
I love tapas bars and have sampled quite a few
Although Xunta has a wide variety of tapas, which are all quite good, it is not a good value
The place has no ambience outside of a cheesey seafaring theme
The seats are awkward -- we sat on tall bar stools around a much shorter barrel
While this might work for the theme they're going for, it makes for awkward eating
Plus, their white sangria was awful and served in a tiny glass! I'm used to light, crisp sangria in a large glass with tons of fruit floating around in it -- this tasted more like a screwdriver
I have eaten at much nicer tapas bars in the city for about the same price (and, yes, I've been to Spain and know that tapas bars there are more casual there)
Tapas? We love 'em
Xunta USED to be wonderful for its great tapas, sangria and value
It seems as though they've raised the prices there and laminated their menu - making the place slightly more generic
But we still love it
Order a pitcher (or two) of sangria and get the dates wrapped in bacon
Good stuff
You used to be able to eat like a king there for next to nothing, but now, the prices are like any other NYC restaurant
I guess that's a sign of the times
still a great option, though
This is a great tapas place for groups of 8 or less
I think anything larger would have been tough or would have split us as they have long-tables and benches that hold about 8
But the food is superb, with no seafood overdone
One of the few places that knows how to make octopus without it being rubbery
It was pretty noisy though, even on a Wednesday, so I woun't recommend it for good conversation
Xunta made me feel as if I were back in northern Spain
The tapas were authentic and the wine list is fantastic
I sat towards the back of the restaurant on the group picnic tables, although there are individual tables in front around the bar
The laid back atmosphere and friendly waitstaff make this place worth it
Good place to go with friends, but it is easy to meet new ones as well
Do not waste your time or money going to this place
The service was awful
The hostess failed to mention the 1hr eating policy, which we only found out about once our server tried kicking us out
Mind you, we had not finished drinking our Sangria (which absolutely sucked) nor eating our tapas (which took forever to arrive)
I say to Xuntas pack up your place and go back to Spain
Your attitude is not welcomed here!
I can't believe anyone would recommend this place! It looked like a gritty Red Lobster
The waitstaff was ambivalent at best
And the food was TERRIBLE! We got burnt empanada, the garlic shrimp tasted frozen, and we waited just under an hour for a plate of cold sliced cheese
We thought the drinks must make up for all of it - wrong
Weak sangria
The sardine plate was a good deal

I love this place
The service is great, and the food is delicious! I went last week, and I got a homemade rolled pasta with pesto sauce that was unbelievable! My friend got the pasta special, which was a papperdelle with veal osco bucco
Also amazing! I also love the bread/tomato appetizer they give you on the house
sooo yummy! The waiter was very helpful in recommending which dishes we should get, as we were torn between a few things that sounded great
Our orders took a while to be served
They mostly have seafood, great pumpkin ravioli
Small and cozy restaurant, not great for large parties
I used to love the LDV on 13th Street, and recently tried out the LDV on Spring
Yecch
Same diverse menu, same interesting-looking specials, but my pasta was soggy and it was festooned with dry, tasteless shellfish
Service was awful
Too bad
I went here with a friend and spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what to get
Every dish I saw brought out looked great
I had the some special pasta dish just covered with shellfish
It honestly ruled! Can't wait to go back
One complaint: service was a bit slow
It may have been because of the Hooter's shirt I was wearing however
I have been going to this restaurant 7 years and never have a complain
The service is always good and the food is consistantly incredible
Very comfortable and homely
The pizza and the hamburger are among the best in the city
Ask for a table by the window and watch the world flow by
The Cafe downstairs is one of my favorite places to take a rest from a full day of shopping in Soho
GREAT COFFEE
The clear glass wall where the little stool is faces is quite entertaining
You can either be observing the passerbyers or be gawked at like your a zoo animal
It's very petite and nice
The upstairs restaurant is very cozy, the food is good, but I wouldn't bother with the food really esp
when you can get better food for the same price
Eat there for the atmosphere AT NIGHT
We went for brunch and it probably wasn't worth the cab ride over there
Bari has GOOD FOOD, great decor, a fabulous location and HORRIBLE SERVICE
The waitress was inattentive AND there was a small fire in the kitchen filling the restaurant with smoke
If you are in SoHo shopping, have nothing to do all day and don't mind having to fend for yourself
this would be the place to eat!
First the positive: the sandwiches looked good and I have no doubt that they were good
had a soup and that was excellent
Now for the not so good part: service - depends on who you got, but it ranged from horrible and rude, to fairly decent and friendly
We went there b/c there was a sign that said 'brunch' outside but it wasn't sit down brunch as one would expect, rather is was 'pay for it at the counter' and go sit upstairs
The eggs were overcooked and even though the menu said 3
25 for frech orange juice, I was charged 4
50 (pointed it out to the cashier but she gave me a rude answer)
The lowdown: Grab a sandwich, or a coffee on the run
Don't bother sitting down there
Cafe Bari is everything a cafe should be: peaceful with a full menu of light food
Everything from their freshly blended drinks to their cake is great
The restaurant has a limited menu and food that is okay but, it leaves me wanting more
Little charlies has been a must in little Italy for as long as I can remember
But I recomend take out only
The service we received on a recent visit was very disapointing
Although we were a large party, (about 12) the restaurant was basicly empty, only 2 other tables were being served
The food as always was fantastic, and the pricing was moderate although I was not happy about the 18% gratuity being added for parties over 6, especially after the horrible service we recieved
This place is great
Out of the way, no additude whatsoever, good food and cheap prices
Don't expect anything fancy, because you will be disappointed here
The service was great, although the wait for the food was sizeable
Drink cold beers to help pass the time
I strongly recommend the simple but elegant broccoli rabe pasta, really a treat
Just like mom used to make!
My husband always went to this resturant even before we got together
He got me hooked on to the baked clams and then we started to go all the time that, he even proposed to me in our favorite booth
Since then we have moved to Florida and every chance we to New York, we have to go to our one and only Little Charlie's
You can never go wrong with there food and you will always feel at home
Little Charlie's has been our family's restaurant for 7++ years
Birthdays, anniversarys, any special event
nothing compliments that special day like genuine Italian cuisine from Little Charlie's
Small group, large group or just a date, the setting is perfect and the menu is guaranteed to please everyone in your party
The Best Italian Restaurant in the City
It is a Clam Bar so have the clams and all the other seafood
I have had everything on the menu and it is all wonderful
This is the kind of place that you don't leave no matter how crowded it is
Little Charlies is the 2nd best to BeniHana Even though they have 2 completely different types of food and atmosphere
Little Charlies sell the best shrimps with Marinara sauce, (unbelievable mouth watering baked clams, seafood and Italian food)
Trust me order the shrimps with marina and you will never want to eat shrimps in any other type of restaurant
big booths and no hipsters
not to mention the dipping sauces for your bread
little charlie's rocks! they have peroni, and the lasagna
mmmm
Charlie's is a great place for Americanized Italian food
The way they do Chicken Parmigian, one can understand how this dish has a cult following in the US
Any dish with their homemade tomato sauce is excellent and worth trying
Actually their salad is good two but comes dripping in dressing so I would ask for it on the side
Beware of the hot tomato sauce - IT IS HOT!
The Scene As familiar to paparazzi as it is to lovers of good food, Woo Lae Oak has basked in its share of the media spotlight
The loft space--angles of metal and granite warmed by exposed brick--has four sections: a bar that doubles as a coat room, a long dining room housing the open kitchen, banquettes separated by gauzy golden dividers, and a hideaway tatami space upstairs
Servers are informed and polite, even on noisy weekend evenings
The Food The restaurant does for Korean food what Jean-Georges did for Thai, dressing it up on a journey around the world
The best dishes are also the most worldly: tiny spinach crepes stuffed with Dungeness crab, nuggets of moist ground rabbit wrapped in bacon, and sweet, fall-apart cod on thickly sliced stage of daikon radish
Traditional dishes get their own section on the menu, including the long list of fresh-marinated meat, fish and vegetables to be self-barbecued
I just don't know how to say that i simply can not get enough of this place
Forget about the fact that all the waiters are unbelievably cute
Really, though, what other restaurant sports an all male cast of cute guys? Yikes, my boyfriend would be crazy if he knew that i was checking out the waiters
we go here all the time
I diverge, the food here is unbelievable
Whatever your culinary preference there is always something for everyone
Vegitarians and steak-eaters alike will love this place
It's hearty food that's not heavy
unless you over-order which is actually easy considering that it's family style
I lived in Asia for several years and adore all asian food, but my boyfriend hates sushi and it's murder getting him into a japanese restaurant unless he's on one of his health kicks

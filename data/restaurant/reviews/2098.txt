You may have to wait for a good 30min, but it's worth it
The food is not done up, just real simple Italian food, served by Italians
Just remember, don't go for the mood or the service
Just go for the food, and get out when you're done- people are waiting
The truffled pasta here is truly outstanding and at something just over $20 it's one of the most expensive things on the menu
Bar Pitti is a standby for excellent food when you're looking to eat and move on, but the staff will start dropping hints for you to move on if you dawdle too long
They're highly knowledgeable and provide businesslike, excellent service - go here before or after the evening, but don't make it the focal point
The wait is usually worth it here, at this always bustling outdoor, downtown scene
Despite the scene, the food is excellent and the restaurant's still worth going to even when the weather doesn't allow outdoor eating
The menu is varied and inventive and allows for trying a number of different things
In contrast to it's next door neighbor, Da Silvano, I like to say the food is twice as good for half the price
Just keep in mind cash only and no reservations, Enjoy!
While the food here is acceptable, the service is not
Plates were swept away the second we pulled the last morsel from them, we were not allowed to order appetizers and main courses separately, we were never asked if we wanted more wine, a request for an extra dessert was denied (a first for me in a New York restaurant) and the whole experience was akin to having dinner on an assembly line
If you don't mind being rushed through your dinner (six of us were in and out in less than 45 minutes), you might like it
Otherwise, forget it
Ordered the steak special that was $27 of 7 tiny, overcooked, grizzly slices of steak served over oily lettuce
When served I said it looked a bit crispy, and they insisted that's how the chef prepares it
Wasn't worth the trouble of sending it back
My date also ordered the expensive veal house special that was dry and tasteless
If you insist on visiting this crowded, overpriced, tourist trap, then stick to the pasta
For the same price, visit that new place -- 50 Carmine -- generous and high quality
I could eat at Bar Pitti every night and never get bored
It's home food with relaxed friendly service
It's not a 4 star restaurant and it isn't trying to be
It is what it is , a place to relax enjoy and have good honest food
Try the osso bocco and the punterelle is also good
I also love their veal milanese and the fegato
Also go at off times because when it's busy you have to wait and it feels rushed
Visited Bar Pitti for the first time - I've traveled to Italy many times and can honestly say that the food at Pitti doens't even come close
Parparadelle was stuck together in a gelatinous mass - you wonder what's going on if they can't even get pasta right! And panna cotta drenched in some sort of chocolate sauce - nice try
Dinner was very rushed - the waiter was bringing out the main course even before we had finished the appetizer
I pity the fool who goes to Bar Pitti!
Some of our friends ho frequent this place regularly every week, insisted we have dinner with them one night and I was surprised to be finding my way down the village to this place I had never heard of before
However, the food is Really good! and if its a nice sumemr evening, si outside, enjoy the excellent wine selection and the company, over a nice dinner! reasonable prices! the wait is long though, even if you make reservations!
Pitti is a great place, but be flexible
Don't come if you MUST be seated immediately, it's a popular place, there's usually a wait and they are going to try to keep people happy by freeing up tables
Food is great and very consistent
I am a huge fan, 4 close friends, all southern europeans, are also huge fans
Go there and have fun - but don't take yourself too seriously
While I'm generally shocked by the generosity of the reviews, Bar Pitti is far more deserving than what I've been reading
We go there more frequently than any other place for the terrific pasta (particularly the one with leeks, artichokes, garlic), the eggplant parmigiano (light well flavorted), sauteed spinach, salads, sandwiches (tuna with capers on crusty roll being a favorite), best cappuccino anywhere
It's cash only
It's not fancy, but it's clean and there are outdoor tables in warm weather
It's one of the few NY restaurants that's not noisy
Go early since they don't take reservations and it's a popular place - right next to the star-studded, more expensive Italian restaurant
A wonderful place if you can order and eat in less than 20 minutes
They are incredibly rude pushy abut turning tables
Be prepared to order in less than 5 minutes, your food (mediocre at best) will come in 2 minutes, and your check will arrive efore you've even finished desert
An altogether unpleasant experience
Tables were VERY close together - service was OK
Food did not impress me and I've spent time in Florence - not exactly authentic in my opinion
Menu is pretty limited but the specials are presented in a fun way
Downside is they throw like 15 specials at you all at once so it's a bit hard to digest
I'd try Italian elsewhere if you're in the mood
A fixture on 6th near Bleecker, Bar Pitti is your classic and classy Italian restaurant
Primarily featuring northern Italian fare, they've never failed to impress diners with their flavorful and consistent cooking
In fact, you'll be hooked after one visit
You'll never think of eating meatballs anywhere else but here
Also, go on the weekends when they make the lasagna--it's the best in New York
Leave room at the end for the torta de la Nonna, a light and lemony pie that is delicious
Not a place to go to with large parties, gets tight
One of the best places to dine in NYC
Yet, some of my less adventurous friends find foods they love here as well
I'll preface this review by saying I'm partial to Cajun and Creole cooking
That said, it means I'm harder to please when it comes to this kind of cuisine
Sazerac doesn't fail to deliver when it comes to taste, variety and quality
Start off with one of the well-made cocktails
For dinner, the crab cakes and the jambalaya are especially good
All of the food is obviously prepared with attention to detailed flavor
It is spiced significantly, without being overpowering
The service was efficient and the servers were pleasant
The price is about what you'd expect to pay for quality
I've been going here for more years than I like to count and it is reaching new heigths
They have a new, young chef, who is doing an outstanding job in the kitchen
The food has reached new heights of quality yet the prices are well withing range of the frequent diner like my wife and I
Try the newly introduced prix fixe special for an exceptionally good deal The staff as always is alert, friendly and professional
The new chef is a delight
The last two times my wife and I visited we were thrilled with the fresh, well prepared fish specials
I ate the best scallops of my life and the time before I enjoyed Skate for the first time
My wife loves oysters and maintains that they still serve the best crab cakes in New York and beyond possibly but she can't verify that but they are and always have been delicious
I read about this on citysearch and was looking forward to a great experience
The only thing that didn't meet my expectations was that the crowd was a bit on the older side and the restaurant was half empty by the time we left (930p)
I had the mixed seafood stew which was delicious!! My husband had the country fried chicken and that was just average
The crab cake app was perfect and the fennel dessert was tasty! I reccommend this restaurant for people looking for a comfortable night out
I frequently have brunch here and used to love it - really good food for a decent price, but the last few times have been really disappointing
The food just isn't as good, and the portion size has definitely shrunk
I'm hoping it's just a bad phase, but it's quite a strong trend
I have been to this restaurant several times in the last few years
I always wonder why I go back
While the food may be good, the service is enough to keep me away
My guest and I walked in one hour before the kitchen was supposed to close
The servers looked angry upon our entry and one woman actually looked at her watch
We were not even greeted with a hello
The bar seemed like a good place to sit and have some food as we were not even offered a table
That was a letdown as well
We sat at the bar, and were not even acknowledged for several minutes
He was busy making drinks for the dining room
Again, we felt like unwelcome visitors
We had a drink and went for pizza instead

This place should be cloned and placed in every neiborhood! I entertain business associates friends and family at Le Petit
The decor is breath taking
Everything from an indoor train, murals, fireplace, jewelry by local artists
The owner is there everyday and the food is GREAT! The servings are large, I mean you get your money's worth and then some
A sure tourists site! My friends are amazed and it becomes the favorite brooklyn spot every time!!! Horray for style, service and Fabulous Brooklyn!
Ive been going there for 3 years now and have had really great experiences there and a few bad ones as well
The Service can be slow at time and there is typically a wait but, the breakfasts are some of the best in the area
Even simple items like scramble eggs and home fries are wonderful
The menu and the place itself have been created with an attention to detail and subtle flair that make this place so popular
Over the years they have gone from being a small caf with a few tables to a restaurant with a beautiful outdoor seating area and a full wine and food menu
I go fairly often and am rarely disappointed
I do occasionally find the wait to be too long and go elsewhere
The service
Never the waitress while you dine in, she is amazing
I placed an order for take out
requested certain items eliminated from my sandwhich
They proceeded to pour my soups first and have them sit on the counter for over 10 minutes while waiting for my sanwhiches
After confronting the counter clerck he assured me the soups would stay warm as long as I wasn't walking 20 minutes to my destination
I arrived home realized that they put all the ingredients I didn't want
I went back (with my cold soups) They said they would have to make me another dish since they couldn't scrape off the unwanted ingredients
OF COURSE! WHAT DID THEY THINK? Didn't even offer to get me new soups
Another day I placed a delivery order
I live 2 blocks away
Took over 45 minutes the food was cold
not only did my friends and i wait approx an hour and a half for omelettes, we were berated and belittled by the owner (manager?) when we brought this to his attention
our server was surly and unresponsive, and we were told the situation was our fault because we hadn't just left
they continue to expand their garden space, w/out expanding their kitchen and cannot provide even adequate service
the food's not worth it, especially when it comes cold, or you don't have silverware, syrup, coffee
or anything else you may need to mildly enjoy
best place for to go food in this neighbourhood
excellent service, excellent food
large menu and unbelivable low prices
Nick's is a great find along this fast-food-chain-ridden stretch of Fourth Avenue
Huge wide-ranging menu, everything--from pancakes to chicken salad sandwiches--done well
Great prices, especially for breakfast, which is why the place is jumpin' most mornings
Don't miss the homemade muffins, they're enormous, and oh-so-good
Service is friendly and efficient
This deli is located in the Sunset Park district of Brooklyn
While they have great salads, and hot/cold bar entrees, it's their sandwiches that stand out
IF the secret to sandwiches is in the slicing then they've got a lock on it
Not matter what type of sandwich you crave, they have it
at a great price! Personal favorite: the Toasted turkey and swiss
Best Foccacia Pizza, Great food, Cheap Prices, Home cooking at close to home prices
Freshest calamari (no matter what time it is)
Generous portions - good for the money
Looking forward to our next visit
Great food - you just gotta go!
we went all the way to Nick's from Manhattan because of the lobster, but had the worst lobster ever - overcooked so badly it was tasteless; the steamers were overcooked too and the lobster sandwich was a pile of unrecognizable breaded seafood mush (well seasoned, but certainly no lobster sandwich); the crab salad was tasteless
nice to sit over the water outside, but the food was much worse than used to be
an expensive disappointment!
I love Palermo
If I had a car, I'd go there more often, but I live 35 blocks away and don't trust carrying pastries home on the bumpy crowded B41 busline
My parents have been going there since as far back as I remember, and I always request that my birthday cake come from Palermo
They're priced excellently, the food is great, and they're always quick to get your order ready for you
The salesgirls, which are usually teenage Catholic schoolgirls, are always friendly and helpful
Definitely deserves a 10
The food was delicious and the staff was even greater! Try the Steak Fajita Plate
This place is awesome!! My friends and I order at least once a week
The chili is amazing!
Excellent menu choices
Surprising for a diner
Perfect for late night or brunch
Waffles at 2am, how 'bout canadian bacon or corned beef? Maybe a steak
Try it you will like it
I love eating dinner at the Floridian
The appetizers, which include beets, cold beans, and waldorf salad, are extremely fresh and crisp
The included soup is hot, and the salad is fresh and crispy
The bread is almost always hot and abundant
The waiters and waitresses are friendly and keep enough distance so you can enjoy your meal and take your time
We're big eaters in my family and yet we always have leftovers to bring home from the dinner special
not that we mind
:)
I really do love this diner
It is a little on the expensive side, but the rations are so huge and the food is so good that it makes it worth it
Definitely a welcome change from fancy restaurants that overcharge and leave you still hungry afterwards
The service is amazing
There is the occasional sullen waitress, but everyone else is very very pleasant and attentive
This is definitely my favorite place to eat, drink, and just plain hang out with friends
Definitely try the curly fries! Wow!
Easily the best diner in Brooklyn - maybe in the world
The menu is extensive - and they kill on the basics
The complimentary pickle bowl is filling on its own
The burgers are tremendous
Great food, very high prices
that's ok, i'll spend 11 dollars for a hamburger, BUT DON'T CHARGE ME 25 CENTS EXTRA FOR DE-CAF!!!!!! Will you be charging for renting the booth next?
The Kings Plaza Diner is the best diner in NY and definitely the best in Brooklyn
They have great food, the most accomodating and classiest staff, and a wonderful atmosphere! I would recommend the KPD to everyone!
I found the service and people very friendly
you recieve what you pay for
large portions come whit the prices
Food is good
My boyfriend and his friends love the KPD
I'm less than charmed, usually
I find it to be a bit overpriced for a place calling itself a diner
After patronizing this place for several years on different occasions, the waiters and waitresses range from cold and inattentive individuals looking for a quick tip with as little interaction as possible to warm extroverts who treat you like you're a family member
The food doesn't particularly leave such a great impression on me
It's nothing I can't get at another diner for about $3 to $5 cheaper a plate
And whats up with charging nearly $5 for a milkshake?
Its one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn
Anyone went there would know they got the best, largest Jumbo shrimp appetizer

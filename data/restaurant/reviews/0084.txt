There are a few amazing staff members who make coming in a great time
There is one guy who works nights and a few days here and there who is so fun to talk to and always has something funny to say
I think his name is Mike or something
So to those who hate 71 we would all rather you go to Starbucks and drink your freakinchinos!!!
I agree with many other critics, the staff act as if they are going to be nominated as the next Super Model
The food and atmosphere isn't too bad
Most of the patrons are rather friendly, as for the noise level, slightly loud for such a cozy place
The service can be snooty even when you go out of your way to be polite
They messed up a Mochaccino!! (I don't know how?) I went ALL the way back from my office to exchange it and it still tasted like garbage
Last time I got one it tasted fine though? I should have gone to Starbucks
I would have spent the SAME amount, gotten a better cup of coffee and minus the 'tude
If you do go, make sure to go to the medium height guy with the black framed glasses
He is very professional
What a find! This hidden, cozy little cafe transports you from your hectic New york life to a place where you can sit back and relax and enjoy the best cup of coffee or even a nice glass of wine
IT'S GREAT COFFEE BUT THE SERVICE IS SERVED WITH BIG TIME ATTITUDE
THE STAFF THINKS THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR BY SERVING YOU
THEY HAVE A FAKE AIR OF HIPSTER SOPHISTICATION
IT'S RIVALS THE BIG TIME ATTITUDE OF THE PORTO RICO ( ST
MARKS) STAFF
IT'S RATHER ANNOYING
Since the most recent review of this place was several months ago, I thought I'd weigh in
Whoever was unfriendly to other reviewers must not work there anymore, because my experience was very positive (and to those of you who thought they were rude - I've worked in coffee places before
maybe they were just being rude in response!) The place is adorable, the food and coffee delicious, and they don't mind if you hang out with a friend or a laptop for several hours
A refreshing alternative in the midst of so many faceless corporate coffee places
The coffee is ok but pricey
The desserts are just as good as all the coffee shops around town but they charge more than anyone
The service is very rude
It's like they're doing you a favor making you a dahm cup of coffee
I highly doubt i'll ever return
I don't see why people make such a fuss about this place
I'll stick with that place Sunburst a block away from them on 18th st and 3rd ave
I came here b/c someone gave a trashy review to my favorite coffee place (Grey Dog's) and compared it to this place so I had to see for myself what was so great about 71
I think I understand: GD is like a tie-dye shirt (comfy, colorful, bohemian) while 71 is like a starched white shirt (elegant, preppy, somewhat uptight)
Don't get me wrong, it's a VERY nice place with a great selection of desserts, coffees and delicious waffles to name a few things, but there is something about it that turned me off a bit (probably the service which ranged from barely friendly to totally stuck up)
Overall, it is a nice place and if you don't mind possible attitude and the not-so-cheap prices, it is a great place to meet for coffee or drinks (they have a nice selection of that too!)
This place rules! But please dont tell anyone
I have noticed this place gets more crowded, so its hard to get a table
Must be the cutest coffee shop in Manhattan
Great place to take a date after dinner
The sweets are ok, but its all abou the ambience
Again, keep this on the down low
no need to spoil a perfect place!
The drinks are just as expensive as the chain coffee houses
The tables weren't bussed and they forgot to make my chai tea, which wasn't all that delicious, not was my friend's coffee
It was very crowded and noisy
Overall, I would rather go to a chain coffee house up the street for the same priced coffee, but a much more relaxing atmosphere, and no one forgetting my order
Excellent coffee! Great place to grab breakfast or lunch
Highly recommended
If you're looking for a nice relaxed place to read the paper, meet up with a friend, do work on your laptop while getting a dose of caffeine, this is the place
The service is great, people are nice, and it's very comfortable
Can get crowded on the weekends, but if you can snag a table, you can stay all day
Their baked goods are tasty and health-conscious, albeit a bit pricey
The redolent smell of coffee wafting in the walls of this charming shop establishes an environment rich with a sense of comfort and ease
The coffee by the name of the place is delicious and although the space is a bit tight, it's a great place to chat, chill or simply enjoy a great cup of joe
Great coffee, with just a touch of a scene- if you just want good coffee for a good price go around the corner to 18 3 to the Sunburst cafe- excellent everything- even coffee
It's a lovely place
Charming and just perfect for anything you want to do in a little cafe
I am from Europe, and the European style cafes were about the only thing that I really missed in New York
Thanks to 71 Irving I do not have to be cafe-homesick anymore
There should be more places like this in NY
What's the big deal about this place? The coffee is good, but not worth the high prices or the incredible amount of attitude served with it
71 Irving IS New York's Best
While the food (coffee shop fare extraordinaire), ambience (this + pastries make newcomers beg for tables here), service (the baristas see me at the door and by the time I arrive at the cash register my oder is waiting for me
I call this good service
What do you think?), and value (easy
it matches the quality) are 10s, what draws the crowds from before the sun is up to long past dark is THE COFFEE! Roasted on owners' farm in NY state, the aroma alone pulls crowds through the door
it's not just the coffee, it's the whole experience
homey but cool, and with tasty pastries and hot waffles
My FAVORITE place to be, Irving has wonderful coffee and a friendly staff
My vote goes to 71 Irving for THE greatest cup of coffee around
Whether you like your coffee strong, mild, or decaffeinated this place has the best of all
Most often we venture here at night for their top of the charts decaffeinated coffee Costa Rican Decaf and Estate Blend Decaf
Everyone I bring to this place say it's THE best DECAF they have ever had
ALL coffees are the tops along with their Balthazar tarts and creative Ice Cream sundaes
Great Staff, great beans
Why is it that I can't have a good day without my jump start at 71! They have the best coffee around! I rotate from their famous 71 Irving House blend to Sleepy Hollow Irving Farm Blend
I've noticed Dean Deluca has caught on to their great coffee
like the rest of us!!! Great staff, pastries and decor
A must for any coffee conoissoir
Farm fesh roasted coffee daily
at our favorite neighborhood cafe
Go 71!!!!!!!!!!!!!
'71' is my first destination when I get into Manhattan
Unfortunately, I live 90 miles north of the city so I can't get there everyday
Fortunately, I can order their coffee, have it shipped and enjoy it all the time
Absolutely the best coffee around! Huge selection of farm roasted coffee served with a smile, absolutely no attitude, and accompanied with the best pastries in Manhattan
Balthazars, Taylors Ceci Cela
and many more
In the most beautiful ground floor brownstone setting
A daily stop for most FlatIron/Gramercy residents
Thousands flock this place at all times of the day
Find out for yourself
71 Irving has THE best cup in town
An addicted patron

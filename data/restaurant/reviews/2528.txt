What a great place to come to and feel welcomed like an old friend! I brought a friend here and we had a fantastic meal (the lasagne and the gnocchi are EXCELLENT) served by a very friendly waitstaff, and Adam and Leonard were right there with the perfect wine recommendation
I would certainly come again, and look forward to the spring/summer with the outside patio deck
If the rumors of a Thursday night party are true, it will also be high on my list for things to do!
The food is just like my mama makes
I cant seem to stop going back! From the service to the food to the wines everythng about this restarunt is great! Leonard and Adam really made me and my relatives from Italy feel at home when I took them there
A job well done boys! And Valentines Day was a HUGE success with my girlfriend
Thanks alot!
I WENT TO VESPA FOR A PARTY WITH A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
THE PLACE WAS EXCELLENT GREAT SERVICE, GREAT FOOD AND PERFECT ATMOSPHERE
ALL OF MY FRIENDS COMPLIMENTED ME ON WHAT A GREAT PLACE IT WAS
A great place, and we could take the baby w/o feeling like lepers
Severs were just wonderful
Brought our friend from Kansas City to enjoy a quality neighborhood place
Owner was friendly, seated us in window near all the old cameras on the wall, and knew how to make a Negroni! Thank you! Delicious food and unbelievable prices
Would definitely go back, especially in warm weather to sit out back
Great food and reasonable prices make this cool Italian bistro our new local favorite
There is also an outdoor garden
Can't wait to go back
Vespa is that rarest of Manhattan restaurants: a comfortable neighborhood place with outstanding food and reasonable prices
The room is pleasantly yet quirkily decorated with Italian movie poster and assorted tchotkes (sit on the back patio if it's warm out)
The service is always attentive, whether you are a first-timer or a regular
The food is always fresh and always excellent
Best of all, the bill won't empty your wallet!
I will keep it short
Don't go here because I want it all to myself
Have the gorgonzola gnocchi!! It's not on the menu just ask for it
it's amazing!!! I don't even like gorgonzola and I LOVE this dish
second up is the truffle gnocchi
and the Lamb is GREST
plus I love Giorgio!!
I'm very ambivalent about publicizing Giorgio's because I don't want my favorite local tiny Italian to get more crowded
But Giorgio deserves it for running a class act, and a good value for this kind of place
No SUV drivers or smokers, please!  My preference is the lamb chops
We've been here a lot with the kids and it's perfect for that
The service is not overly warm but definitely nice and efficient
The garden out back is nice in good weather
On an early weekday night when the budget is low
Also great for sitting outside on the UpperEast side on a random Tue
night
LAST TIME I WAS THERE WAS 2 WEEKS AGO,BROUGHT A DATE, HAD A GREAT TIME IN THE BACK YARD, VERY ROMANTIC QUIET (COULD USE SOME MUSIC), PRICES VERY REASONABLE EVEN AFTER THEY RAISED IT STILL WORTH IT, SERVICE WAS GOOD, FOOD TOOK A LITTLE BIT LONG, (I GUESS IT WAS A BUSY NIGHT), BUT THE SERVER WAS FAST ENOUGH TO SEND US FREE BRUSCHETTA, GREAT JOB, SMILY FACES, JUST WHAT THE UES NEED
Whenever I want to go out for dinner but can't afford an expensive meal I go here
It is a better alternative to McDonald's
The food is very good for the low price and the wait staff is very nice, but sometimes the service is very slow
Last time I went it took about 20-30 minutes to get our appetizer
The gnocchi is delicious!
There's a selection of $4
95 pastas on the menu, and with the bread basket you can indeed fill up
But the appetizers and specials are priced reasonably as well, the dining room is quaint, the backyard is pretty

Full of surprises, Frankie's never disappoints
The menu is a little overwhelming (they serve virtually everything) but rest assured that if they offer it, it's probably good
Standouts include chicken sandwiches, roast leg of lamb (weekends only), potato pancakes and spinich pie
Also, their french fries and homemade lemonade both qualify as best in city! Loyal, elderly clientele give the place a homey, old-world feel
Great for delivery, too
Fabulous, large salads are also a can't miss
Don't pass it up!! I regularly pay twice as much for food half as good as you can get at Frankie's
Anytime day or night, Frankies will feed you classic, solid dinner food
Not a swanky retro dinner, but the real thing with the real food
You gotta love the regulars that are always gracing the tables
The sidewalk tables are great! Everything you think a dinner would have - Frankies does and they do it well
if you are looking for a back to basics dinner - you won't be let down
Was looking forward to this visit and was very disappointed by the choices on the menu - limited to very traditional and heavy dishes, most, if not all of which can likely be found at 1 in 3 italian restaurants throughout the country
The restaurant did not carry thin cut chicken so anyone interested in a scallopini dish had to opt for veal
I went instead with the Valdostana and found it to be unsatisfying, and accompanied by dull mashed potatoes
Sorry - the salad, wine and waitstaff are great but the food is ordinary in a city filled with extraordinary dinining options
We loved the food and ambiance here
I had the Valdostana which was great
The service is understated but respectful and efficient
We will definitely go back
I have NEVER had a bad meal here! It is wonderful, my fav on the ues!
Because the food is so delicious for such a reasonable price, it's best to make a reservation, especially on the weekends
I've been here a few times and each time, the service and food are both quite good
I definitely recommend it!
They have wonderful food and the dishes are good sized and delicious- but the staff is snobby and they tend to rush you out
Also, look at you like you're scum if you come in without a reservation- even though they have the room!
I was first impressed with the charming decor of the restaurant, but that was soon the only positive attribute during lunch
My guest and I were seated given menus and instantly asked for our order
Asking for more time was apparantly a mistake as the waiter had to be found to take our order (only 3 tables were seated at the time)
The waiter was unenthusiastic, and the food was boring and bland
The fellow patrons competed on their cell phones with blaring Musak while the restaurant's phone rang continuously at a distracting volume
The owner (or manager) glared at employees like a tyrant
Upon completion, we were pressed for time and asked for the check
and asked
and asked
When it was delivered, I was bitingly told that they do not accept anything but American Express
The Scene Inside, it looks more like a minimalist gallery than a dining room, with shiny white plaster walls, sandstone panelling and tendrils of green leaves artfully arranged on a single windowsill
Despite the diminutive size, harsh acoustics and tightly-arranged tables, the Rapp family makes diners feel exceedingly comfortable
Service is personalized, tableware is elegant and a reverent mood surrounds the open kitchen
But don't even attempt an impromptu visit--a tony crowd keeps this hidden find's reservation line on speed dial
The Food The seasons inform this internationally-inspired menu, where top-notch ingredients and careful preparations fetch top dollar
Mexican influences shine through beautifully roasted, shrimp-stuffed poblano with sweet corn emulsion, and succulent Niman pork shoulder falls from the bone in a chili-powdered mole
Homemade pappardelle is simple and sublime, but more ambitious dishes, like rosemary-laced lamb with sweet figs with a potato-broccoli rabe gratin, are worth the splurge
Though the name is French for "United States," the only Gallic hint is an underdone--though insanely rich--souffl
We went for an early Saturday dinner
The restaurant is small, but intimate and the service is great
The date pudding is absolutely spectacular
However, the appetizers and the main course, while good, didn't seem at the same level you would expect from a restaurant at this price point
Divine
A reason to win the lottery is to be able to eat there every night

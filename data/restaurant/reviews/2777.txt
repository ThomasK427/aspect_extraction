Dining with 6 or so in the two window seats up front is even a bit more fun
Who needs Manhattan? Ever since Osaka came on the scene, all we have to do is walk 5 minutes for the best sushi around
The portions are HUGE and the price is lower than anything you get in Manhattan for half the fish
Everything is fresh as can be and the menu is pretty extensive
They even have a quaint garden in the back
We've been spoiled
After Osaka any other sushi just isn't the same
Been coming to this restaurant now for at least 5 years and can honestly say have never encountered anything but an excellant meal, no matter what was ordered, from the simplest pastas to the more involved dishes
Have recommended it to many people, and never got a negative response from anyone! Only raves!
The Scene A stone-faced facade welcomes diners to a restaurant that feels barely touched by the neighborhood's rapid transformation into a nighttime hot spot
Most of the guests, middle-aged and older, have been coming for years, attracted by the inviting service and traditional Italian-American ambience, with live piano at the bar, shelves of wine on display, and arched murals of Venice
To the side of the main dining room, a corridor of tables offers a view of Union Street through the atrium windows; upstairs, a banquet hall hosts lively receptions
The Food Starters, such as the zesty Caesar salad and clams on the half shell, tend to pack more flavor than the entrees, which include a mild striped bass and a rather dry pork chop topped with hot, hot marinated peppers from the jar
Let me first say, I am a 22 year old Manhattanite - and this is the way Italian dining should be done
LEAVE MANHATTAN FOR THIS PLACE! -The owner had bricklayers from Italy to build the building
from scratch - the piano, bar, food, service are all exceptional
I reccomend Marco Polo for all - but especially for the young trendy/hip who have grown up on terribly dim lighting, strange food, astronomically priced menus, SNOOTY hosts OK service - Marco Polo is the antithesis of all these downers - Guys, you will be treated like a King - and if you bring a date (YOU SHOULD) - she'll be your queen before the espresso and Sambuca get there
ENJOY
Fetucine al Vino Rosso is ampng thebest pasta dishes known to man
I'm not exaggerating
Imagine a red wine pasta made at the restaurant with a red wine suace that is then tossed in a scraped out cheese wheel with lots of Parmigiano Reggianno and you've imagined a taste of heaven
I work nearby and have hosted many clients and friends at Marco Polo
They don't just say they are thrilled I know many have made the trek back to Brooklyn only to eat here
There isn't a bad dish on the menu so try to leave room for dessert
This restaurant has always surpassed my expectations
The angel hair with shrimp and arugula continues to be my favorite dish
The service is impeccable
The Scene Honeycomb-colored walls, random wall art, a peek into the kitchen from paper-topped tables--all combine for a casual, thrown-together ambience
The devoted late-night crowd of the neighborhood's bohemia--don't be surprised to hear French drift from table to table--lingers at tables over steaming plates and brimming glasses of wine
On winter nights, a fireplace gently warms a side dining room
The Food Classic French cuisine like smoked duck on a bed of frisse or mussels in a simple white wine broth immediately set a poetic mood
Specials--get the perfectly crisped duck confit when offered--should be taken advantage of
Seafood shines at every turn: The generously sized crabcakes arrive crunchy on the outside and meaty on the inside, while tender scallops melt in the mouth
But the rib-eye steak frites with a rich au poivre are especially hard to pass up
Desserts keep up the pace, with an Earl Grey-flavored pot-au-creme taking the cake
I went here with friends last week, and we all ordered from the prix fixe menu- a gamble in some places, but a winner here, as it turns out
All of the food was very good, portions were large, and service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing
A great little place
My friend and I went to Patois during Dine In Brooklyn (April)
What a disappointment
The oysters were charred, not roasted and the duck was really dry
Patois ran out of bread by 8 p
m
and no apologies were given
The servers were horrible
In addition, their credit card machine wasn't working and the hostess snapped at me because I told her I would wait a few minutes for the computer to go back online
She wanted me to go across the street to the no name ATM and get cash for a $3 service fee
It's not worth the hype
Brunch is excellent at Patois
Great food and great prices
Dinner is average
Service is average
AWFUL FOOD, TERRIBLE SERVICE, Last night was one of the worst restaurant experiences my husband and I have had
Snails were like rubber, both entrees were cold when served to us, chewy chicken tasted like it was grilled two days prior taken out of the fridge and reheated, waitress was just as awful as the food, SO UNPROFESSIONAL, UNFRIENDLY, AND SPILLED wine on my coat (she was pouring our wine throughout dinner but bringing the bottle over my WHITE coat multiple times
She didn't seem to care at all while watching me scrub with salt, soap and ice cubes
I cannot believe we left her a tip! I want my money back
I will be writing the chef, the owners, and every restaurant critic I can find
Food was amazing and service was very attentive
We came in without a reservation but were seated promptly
Great food, reasonable prices, good wine list, nice atmosphere, attentive and knowledgable service
What more can I ask for?
New Year's Eve is also my boyfriend's birthday
Every year, I try to find a nice, intimate restaurant to take him
The Patois website has some GREAT pictures that really show off the embiance I could expect - and we were not disappointed
On a cold night, it was an oasis of warmth, comfort and romance
Seated immediately, though a little early for our reservation
Excellent service went above and beyond expectation (I casually asked what kind of fruit was used as a garnish, the waiter returned with a piece of the unusual pear/apple to show it to me
This at his last seating on a night when he probably wanted to be anywhere other than working! I've been there, I know!) Perfect level of attentive / hands-off service that a couple could want on a special night
Guess where we're going for Valentine's Day?
We've been here twice and each time was really great
The food is excellent and the service is attentive, pleasant and makes for a great experience
Very French and intimate, it's a great place for a romantic meal
I go here for all my special occassions
maybe five times a year
I love it! the ambience is perfect relaxed but romantic and charming
the service is always good and the food is terrific value
i don't understand the negative reviews
I have never been disappointed
I have been to Patois too many times to count, twice in the past 10 days
I have never had anything less than good service
You'd think that I would have come across this loud owner or something, but not yet
I can imagine that would rub you the wrong way
but I wouldn't know
What I can say: the prices are good, the food is great, the ambience is wonderful
Last night I said to my wife why don't we come here more often!?! I want everything on the menu  Eventually I will
I had a wonderful meal here
I arrived around 9:30 pm on a Thursday with my fiance
We were seated immediately
We enjoyed the appetizers of vegetable tartine (fab!) and the special for the evening, clam strips with arugula (I could eat that every night)
My salmon was wonderful, and my finace is still raving about his steak frites
All this and a bottle of wine for ~$100
Lovely!
I had a very romantic meal here and the food was excellent (both of the dishes we got were out of this world good and we both cleaned our plates)
We sat in the back and the mood was perfect for our anniversary dinner
Unlike some of the other reviewers, we found the waitstaff helpful, full of good suggestions and attentive
Although the night ended up being a bit pricey, it was worth every penny (and scrumptious bite)
The fare is quite basic for a French Bistro
The prices are reasonable and the wine decent
Food isn't over the top, but it didn't hurt my stomach either :) Staff could be quicker
It's a good place to go when you want a cheaper casual dining experience

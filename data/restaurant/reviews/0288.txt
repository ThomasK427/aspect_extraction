My raw clams were as small as you could get, and my fried oysters and clams were skimpy, heavily coated, and not memorable at all
Grilled veggies were OK
My friend's grilled scallops were OK
Overall, very mediocre food at very expensive prices, at the worst possible dining environment
I have eaten at Mary's Fish Camp several time and it is by far the best seafood in Manhattan
I have a few favorites but I have sampled most of the menu and it is always deliciously wonderful
I enjoy the atmosphere, I feel like I have found an exquisite dining treasure
I've been to Mary's 7 or 8 times and always enjoyed myself
Great fresh fish, creative (but not too fancy) dishes and good service
True, the wait can be maddening, but that's NYC
It is a bit pricey for those of us who don't work on Wall Street, but again this is NY, not Cape Cod
Overall, a great experience
Mary's is just the best! Although the wait can be long (I suggest eating after 9 on a weeknight), it is absolutely worth it! The Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, as were my diver sea scallops with sun-dried tomato risotto
I've also had (and LOVED) the lobster roll and lobster pot pie
The laid-back decor and wooden benches remind me of being in the Florida Keys, sipping a beer and eating the freshest seafood around! Note to Mary: please bring back the key lime square for dessert -- LOVE IT!
The food was salty, the service was so-so, the wait is nuts! (2 hours) decor was like a broken down kitchen with wobbly tables, the prices isn't all that cheap
Id rather go to Pearl Oyster bar
Mary's is a great neighborhood spot with friendly service
You always know what to expect - Food is simply prepared, but excellent
I especially like the appetizer menu and usually order two instead of an entree
Mary's Fish Camp (and Pearl) simply serves THE BEST seafood in NYC at this price range
lobster role lobster role lobster role - yes, it's to die for (as are the fries that come with it) but everything on the menu is excellent and super fresh
one problem - we've experienced very rude staff
and not like they look over worked - or we were demanding - just like their rude because it's accepted here
I don't get it
but go anyway and ignore the staff
there's no wait at lunch!
Thats the attraction of this quaint place
Appetizers (clam chowder was like minestrone, raw oysters were miniscule) were disappointing
Though I found the ingredients be very fresh (I saw the cook carrying them to the kitchen), our entrees were very salty
Clam chowder was just right, but
I liked the wait staff and the decor, and hopefully I will see the improvement in taste next time
I wonder if the people who wrote those negative reviews have ever even eaten at Mary's my wife and i eat there at least once a week and we love it always perfect seafood, a well matched wine list, and great wait staff a must try if you are craving seafood
Terrific value; innovative, interesting preparations of very fresh ingredients
Hard to find fish/seafood this good at these prices
Really worth all the negatives to enjoy the positives
we had to wait for more than an hour to get a seat, and it was a weekday! the food was decent, the lobster roll was really good, but the soup was mediocre
not sure if the long wait was worth it
No reservations taken and a possble wait
Fortunately, the first shift of seafood lovers flow right in
Sit at the counter, better if only 2-3 persons
You also get a view of the kitchen and the attention put into the well-prepared dishes
Walk into Mary's with a large appetite and you may end up eating your way into a bank-roll and into the popular lobster-roll
Satisfaction gave way to lobster knuckles ($9), almost feeling guilty being served such a healthy portion - served cold - delicious
Followed up with arugula and fennel with sweet gorgonzola, fried oysters/clams, salted crusted shrimp, and grilled corn on cob
Finished with homemade peach cobbler/icecream and a icecream fudge sundae topped with homemade peanut brittle
Other appetizing dishes - grilled softshell crabs, a fried fish (deboned for you), and the 1 1/2lb lobster ($25)
In addition, you get a pleasant environment and wait staff
After waiting 30 minutes to get a table you would expect a little more from a place with this much hype
Atmosphere is cramped and noisy
Service is delivered with tons of attitude
The food is mixed with some dishes like the lobster roll is decent while most fish dishes are bland
This is my first time having dinner at Mary's
The place is small but crowded
We waited 20 minutes for our table for 5 people
They do not take reservations over the phone so arrive early to put your name down on the list
The waitresses was nice and very informative
The seafood we had was great
It was fresh and tasty
I would definitely go there again
Somewhere in between the tens and the ones we found the truth about Fish Camp
We have been hitting the Best of List candidates and although we prefer another local lobster shack, it has been so hard to get in there this summer that we thought we'd try the knockoff
The hostess was RUDE and ignored our questions but the waitress was fine
Stick with the basics, lobster roll (very expensive!) oysters, salad
The harder stuff, whole fish, etc
you need to steer clear of--our fish was burned on the outside, raw on the inside and we won't even discuss the fried oysters and clams (we had ONE clam!) When you can't get in down the street, this is fine and we haven't had a wait any of the three times we've been
the food was fine-certainly nothing different than you could make at home
fry up some shrimp with some salt
there you have it
the person i was dining with hated hers
the food aside, EVERYTHING else about this place sucked
there are no more than 6 tables
probably seating capacity of 18 people total
our wait was 2 hours, and the hostess was extremely rude to us
once we were seated, over 2 hours later, the service was equally bad
i DO NOT recommend this place
Mediocre and long waits! With so many other restaurants to choose - why bother here!
Mary's is exactly what I've been looking for as a frequent diner: A neighborhood place with the highest quality food, a casual yet professional staff, and a hip but unpretentious crowd
Mary's is simply the best
Her seasonal menu always delights
From the refreshing Yellow Tomato Salad in the summer to the comfort of Lobster Pot Pie in the colder months, Mary's never disappoints
I cannot believe there is anyone out there who would--in all honesty, that is--give Mary's a low rating
I question the objectivity of those who have done so
All one has to do is look at the ratings of the citysearch editors to see what's what
Go to Mary's
Have great food
Have a great time
Living in the hood - Mary's is just like camp! Bad service and food! Gave it a few tries and disappointed each time! Go back to Florida!
The food was mediocer and the service ok
Reminds me of camp and camp food!
Consistently the best and freshest seafood in New York -- and affordable
Not just phenomonal fish, but fist class shellfish and salads
Everything I've tried on the menu impressed and delighted me (grilled lobster; soft shell crabs; pan roasted wild atlantic bass; diver scallops; whole grilled fish), but do try the specials when available
Friendly, casual ambience and a light, airy design
I prefer seating at the sweeping, stainless steel bar for a great view of the succulent oysters being opened
Forget the four star giants uptown: the creative, straight forward seafood preparations at Mary's Fish Camp thrill me everytime


without the hefty bill
(I go early or stop by a little bit ahead of time to leave my cell number with the hostess

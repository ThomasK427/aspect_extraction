Unfortunately I had to go all the way to Atlanta, GA to experience a Houton's Meal
but now that I have I'm addicted!!!! The Spinach Dip is to die for
I always order 2
and the food is amazing!!! 2 Thumbs Up for Houstons!!!!
You can't go wrong in a place where they grind filet's into chop meat
Burgers are always cooked to your temp over a hickory grill which adds great flavor
Firehouse cheeseburger is the way to go but only available on saturdays where they even give free chili to firemen
Now thats a deal
Fantastic ribs, meat just falls off the bone! Spinach dip is a must
A bit fancy/pricey for BBQ but a nice treat
Houston's has great food overall, but hands down and clean, the best ribs in town
I recommend their burgers, stakes and their great BBQ dishes
Call in advance for reservations if coming for dinner
I think Houston's has the BEST burger!! I've never tasted any better!
Houston's is a wonderful choice for any kind of craving
it's casual to upper-casual setting is perfect for just a great meal
It's reasonably priced for the food and service
It has great location and I can always count on getting there when I need a really good meal
If you don't try the spinach dip while you're there you haven't experienced Houston's!
Houstons is a great place that has all traditional american food, great portions, and overall GREAT ATMOSPHERE
its dimly lit, large and the bar is always a jumpin scene every night
we always come here
and never are disapointed
oh and the spinach dip is the absolute best in the city!
TERRIBLE PLACE! We waited 10 minutes just to get seated and waited another 15 or so just to get our order taken
They never informed us (until the check came) that the 2 for 1 drink special couldn't be split btwn 2 people
A friend ordered a quesadilla w/ chicken and received one w/ bright orange cheese along w/ some cold soup
Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese
The check came w/o the drink special included and w/ gratuity included (our party was only 3 people!!)
in conclusion, THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!
The food was downright terrible
The salmon sandwich was a molded patty
I found still frozen fries in my already tasteless french fries
Then, they tried to charge me $50 instead of $20 for the order
I have tried this place twice, both times with horrible experiences
The people are unfriendly
They refuse to alter or change the menu even slightly
Bruch is horrible with eggs drenched in oil and butter, making them completely unedible
Dinner is no better with terrible sauces on poorly made, generic pasta and fish
With such a nice location at the seaport, it's a shame that this restaurant is lacking in every way
Horrible! The menu looks nice, but what you get is undescribably horrible
Buffalo wings were dry, overfried, chinese food chickens wings with some buffalo sauce smothered on them
I didn't even eat one and sent it back, but they still put it on my bill, which I had to contest
Tuna was cold and unappetizing
Chicken alfredo was too buttery and thick in all the wrong ways, chicken bites tasted boiled
Service was very shaky, however, at least they were overall polite
Bottom line: DO NOT GO THERE
This is the coffee house that you head to when you need a delicious cup of coffee
As the other reviews suggest, the friendliest counter guys make your coffee with lightening fast speed
Regulars generally have their orders waiting, the coffee is made from the time you walk in the door until you reach the counter, which only gives the barrister 5-10 seconds, but he always manages
JB is a wonderful place
I highly recommend it
Their pastries are good too, but the coffee is the real prize at this place
Tell them Shorti sent you, youll get a laugh
The service is really fast and friendly, and the value is great
They don't rack up charges for extras, and a great place to get your coffee to go, or when you are in a rush
There is little room though to sit if you are looking for a coffeehouse, and the quality is at times hit-or-miss, though the value outweighs the occassional disappointments
Be forewarned that the coffee comes very hot
He should probably be making millions at NASA, but instead one of the world's quickest, smartest and friendliest individuals is serving coffee at J B
If you're a regular, you don't even have to order-- as soon as you enter the store, your drink is ready
A Village institution
There is nowhere else to buy coffee in New York
Period
The Scene  Tucked into a townhouse storefront, Aki is one small, sparely decorated room dominated by a sushi bar and half a dozen tables
Despite the minimalist environment, there is a feeling of luxury in the air, due to the on-point, attentive staff, who refill glasses and swap settings between courses like they are genuinely called to it
The Food  Chef Nakanishi has cooked in Jamaica, and he brings a Caribbean palette to the table here
An appetizer of uni, scallops and roe in coconut cream is unexpectedly delicious, as are yellowtail, mango and avocado rolls
The banana-tuna maki is an ambitious near-miss
Aki's tuna tartare, with raisins, coconut flakes and a dark chutney-ish sauce, easily holds its own in the contested NYC tartare standings
All the fish here is superlatively fresh
The majority of the clever inventions are wild successes, and even the standard fare is terrific
ive been here twice and really like the food
$50 prix fixe meal gets you 3 appetizers along with sushi, sashimi, or a combo of both, and dessert
appetizers are big enough to share (so 2 ppl can try 6 different appetizers), and is the best part of the meal
the food here is japanese with a caribbean flair - from what i gather, this means jerk sauce, sweet potatoes, bananas, and coconuts combined with fresh sashimi, eel, and tofu
awesome
i recommend the eel napoleon (layers of eel and mashed pumpkin atop a square of fried tofu), uni coco (uni in a coconut cream), and the tuna mille-feuille (alternating slices of toro, apple, and avocado in a vinegar sauce)
very good value - i eat a lot, and im always stuffed
staff is extremely attentive, patient, and polite - even if you have a multitude of requests
I had a great experience at Aki and I am looking forward to dining there again
Great prices, fresh sushi and friendly service
I ordered the fried shrimp roll - delicious
As was gyoza for appetizer
I've been eating here regularly since I moved to the village in 2002
I've sinced moved to Chelsea but still order delivery or eat in once a week
Their delivery guy is always prompt and friendly!
this place is pretty good, fairly cheap, and very inventive
I love the omakase menu, although i only have room for the $45 option
the desserts are amazing-- i have had all three desserts in one sitting once (yes, I was hungry)
make sure you make reservations, b/c the place is tiny!
I come to this place at least twice a month for dependable, reasonably priced, creative and tasty food
Tomoe is not only a bit boring in comparison, but they also serve their sushi with warm rice, which is why I prefer Aki (I'm a bit nervous about microorganisms, so I like rice to be cooled first)
The service is wonderful
Wait staff is attentive, and the hostess will take your cell number if there is a wait for a table, so you can enjoy all the Village has to offer
I like it very much!
Admittedly, I do generally eat here pretty late when perhaps the best cuts are gone for the night, but I'm consistently underwhelmed by the not-so-fresh, not-so-flavorful fish
The big thing Aki has going for it are the interesting roll combinations
For far better fish at the same price (but less interesting roll combinations), try Yama, just around the corner
Tomoe is a smidgen more expensive with a REALLY long wait, but it's the freshest of 'em all
I went to Aki based on the superlative recommendations of other Citysearch reviewers, and found it to be a rather average sushi restaurant

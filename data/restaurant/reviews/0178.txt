Foi Gras with a Sauternes to start? Salad and Chardonnay? Lamb and Pinot? Steak and Cab? It all works here, and it doesn't stop until you say so
Bravo
Thank you Craft for beginning such a wonderfully self indulgent trend
I can't wait to go back, it was one of the best dinners I have had in so long
From the moment we were greeted by Irene and Heidi to the service Gregory provided and the food, melted in your mouth
Gregory the waiter picked a great wine for $62 to go with my Kobe beef and my wife's Halibut
The food melted in your mouth
The decor was perfect as the tables were just the right space apart from each other
If you want a great dinner try this place
About $80 per person without alcohol and worht every penny
Went with my mother and her girlfriends for lunch during Restaurant Week
If it was that good then at those prices, I'm sure it it's good all the time! Everything is served family style, so you get a taste of everything
The oysters and fish were very fresh, the steak was amazing, and the sides were VERY creative
Don't miis the deserts - lavender ice cream with chocolate cake and the apricot tart with strawberry-kiwi sorbet were both off the charts
I will definetly be back with my friends and boyfriend, and my mother liked it so much she's bring my dad!
High expectations might have been what did it - but I wasn't all that impressed with Craft
I went with a group at lunch and received excellent service but they really shouldn't bother with a prixe fixe lunch - the salad was a few pieces of lettuce, the skate was good but small in portion
If we hadn't ordered extra sides the meal would have been an entire let-down but the sides were delicious - especially the polenta, artichokes, and garbanzo beans
I was satisfied but I just wouldn't go back - there's so much more out there
Plus, there was no one there at lunchtime - it was erie
Beautiful space, effective service, streamlined food with respect for the ingredients
If you think that the sauces are what make the meal this is not your kind of place
Best Jerusalem Artichokes (sunchokes) I've had anywhere
Hen of the Woods Mushrooms were flavorful and the delicate cured char appetizer was accented by the creme fraiche and lemon confit, not overpowered
Craft serves up creations that are so simple it is amazing how wonderful they taste
It's all about featuring natural flavor here
This has got to be one of the best restaurants anywhere
The crowd is a little on the annoying side but the staff makes up for it
Craft is a true culinary experience
Exquisite food, a healthy wine selection and a helpful and efficient waitstaff all make Craft one of the best restaurants in NYC
Go for there market menu at lunch if you're looking for a deal, it's the best in town, 20 bucks!!! The food was amazing
Not large proportions, eat slowly and savor it and you'll be so full by the end of the meal
Friendly but not cold waitress
It's a casual place for someplace fancyish and upper class
Comfortable
Wonderfully good!
It's a one of those new and exotic restaurants with long lines as its foremost appealing feature
The interior design is spartan with an appealing giant canvas at the end of the room
I tried the tasting menu and enjoyed it - I found the salad particularly satisfying
My guest was not as excited about the food but nothing was off putting
Decent outing
Dinner on 2/27/03 consisted of three courses and a few glasses of wine
totaling $265
Now, I'm not cheap, and I believe in paying for what you get, but to be honest the food quality was touch and go
The fois gras was excellent, as were the oysters
The gnocchi was extremely salty
in fact inedible
The monk fish was way over-spiced
The free-range chicken tasted very similar to my own roast chicken at home
The chocolate souffle was fabulous
The atmosphere was terrific and the service was spectacular
I love when waiters attend to your every need, but you never really noticed they were there
Overall, I'm glad I went, but don't think I'd rush back
I recently went to Craft and was pretty disappointed
Our waiter was not attentive or very helpful and the prices were a little much for what we got
Honestly, I think the food is a little boring and I can make the same dishes at home
We had Hamachi to start and it was a little fishy
We then had braised short ribs that were very fatty and the herb risotto that was nothing special
I love the atmoshpere and I had a great cosmo from the bar and I would give it another chance b/c I have heard so many great things about this restaurant
All in all I was not impressed and I thought the food was plain and a little boring
This restaurant was good but may be overrated
The food was above average but not outstanding (however we did go in with high expectations after all the hype we'd heard)
Compared to other NYC restaurants, this one is NOT a great value for the money but worth a visit if you're on an expense account
my friend described this place as sublime and she was absolutely right! the best foie gras i've ever had, which actually was enough to fill me (it's foie gras), and i also had the oysters which were lovely
beautiful atmosphere, dim soft lighting, and an impressive wine cellar
classy, yet lacking pretentiousness
my only wish was for it to be a bit more quiet
with exposed brick, it's hard for the noise to be absorbed
expensive, but if you've been craving that blood orage sorbet or that quail, it's worth it!
The food is excellent, but the production involved drains most of the pleasure from the experience
The waitstaff was willing but less than thrilled to explain the ordering process or to offer suggestions
Long pauses between courses dragged out the evening
But if you're celeb-obsessed, you may very well spot someone here
Dining at Craft
The food was fine, the service was fine, and the place looks good
Very pricey
With the greasy sidewalk, the stream of garbage residue coagulating in the gutter on 19th Street, it looks like the pigeon population will benefit nicely from Crafts 3 star menu
Im glad I went during the winter months
I went with a couple of friends after hearing rave reviews about it
The food was awful
I had a piece of durade that was parched, the hanger steak was just plain tough
Our server was great, she was very engaging and attentive
Service is one thing but a restaurant like Craft needs to have much better quality food for the price they charge
The food is delicious, just expect to pay a hefty price for it!! If money is not an option, I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation
This restaurant is the first time I have felt ripped off dining in Manhattan
Portions are small, they try to pass themselves off as family style by encouraging sharing and putting dishes in the center of the table, but it is glorified a la carte
I ordered the monkfish - I have tasted better in my company cafeteria
Service was indifferent, our waitress seemed mostly bored/annoyed by our group
After ordering a drink upon being seated, I was never asked the rest of the evening if I wanted another drink
We were a party of six, bill was over $500, and we left unsatisfied, looking for a McDonald's to stop at on the way home
I made reservations a month in advance and received a call the day before confirming my reservations
When I arrived I was told rather obnoxiously that no reservations existed
When I told im the name of the girl who called to confirm (which should have been proof enough), he told me he not only doesnt have it for that night, but he has no reservation anywhere under my name, and asked if I had called the right restaurant
I prompltly left and will never return again
NYC has too many good restaurants to deal with such an attitude
We visited for our first dinner recently but will go back again and again
The food is prepared beautifully with no fuss on plain oblong plates--nothing to distract from the flavors and textures
Service was warm, welcoming, and very gracious
He has a particularly interesting touch with vegetables, and the brussels sprouts were the best ever
Next time we'll go back with a larger group to sample more of the dishes, which are served family style

Once the check was on the table he came back every minute to see if we were ready to pay
Oh yeah, if you wanted your water glass refilled, forget about it
I was at Bar Americain last week for dinner
I sat at the bar
The food was passable--I had a rib-eye that was slightly overspiced but, thankfully, not overcooked
What worried me about Bar Americain was what I saw go on next to me
A girl was sitting by herself, enjoying a glass of wine
She knew the bartender and the staff--everyone addressed her by name--but clearly no longer worked there
One of the waiters went over to her to say hello and I heard the manager whisper to the waiter, Do NOT talk to her
I can't express how inappropriate I thought this was, given the fact that guests pay between $50 and $100 per person to dine in this establishment
I refuse to patronize a place that doesn't treat human beings with respect, and urge everyone else to do the same
The crisp zucchini blossom stuffed with shredded pork was tasty, the grits with shrimp were perfectly cooked and the skate with capers entree--delicious! The creative cocktails had a quality, purist foundation that gave them depth with each added sip
Could the attentive, well-timed service have been any better--no! Those Parker Rolls to start were a winner
The atmosphere, including Bobby Flay briefly visiting the dining room before heading back to the kitchen, was grand yet warm and down to earth
We had a romantic time but would also consider returning with friends
We went with a group of Flay fans last night
The dining experience was exceptionally mediocre
The menu was nothing special, hardly the caliber of the Food Network star
The salmon portion was small, the rack of pork is really just a chop both were priced around $30
We left hungry and wished that we had spent this kind of money on somehere more enjoyable
There's nothing to rave about
It might as well still have been the Judson Grill
NYC prices for an average plate
I went to this restaurant expecting the best
Because B
Flay has been so successful , I figured his food must be excellent! Boy was I mistaken - my friend and I both ordered steaks (half the menu is steaks and he is supposedly the grill king)
His steak was overcooked and chewy, mine was cooked medium rare but it was the toughest piece of NY Strip steak I have ever eaten! Basically both were low quality steaks
We also ordered the creamed kale - while it sounds cute, it did not come together as expected
The best part of the meal were the fries
The bill for two bad steaks, two sides and wine was more than for a 5 star steak restaurant, where I would be guaranteed a great steak
Definitely not worth the money
If you decide to try it, keep your expectations low and dont order steak!
If a place full of Hobokenites downing shots with co-workers in lieu of having a real life is your idea of fab, then go here
If you prefer to enjoy your drinks and dinner without attitude (from co-patrons OR the staff) then do not go here
The maitre 'd was beyond attitudinal and obnoxious, utterly unwarranted in a restaurant a) that far north of 14th st and b) of that caliber
Food was decent, but not worth the madness
We went to Bar Americain for a special occasion and I cannot recommend it highly enough
The food was amazing showcasing all of Flay's love for vibrant flavors and aggressive spicing but with a subltly I have not tasted at his other restaurants
The raw bar is absolutley fresh, the dishes came hot and the presentation was lovely
All of this on an incredibly busy night
Our waiter was knowledgable, personable and really made us feel welcome
I can't wait to go again! However, I would caution you if you are going on a first date or for a romantic night out because the restaurant is loud
This restaurant is one of the best
The versatility is ideal for different occasions
The menu has many choices, and the dining experience lends itself to being a great place for a date, client dinner, parents' dinner or even a start-off to a night out on the town
Because of my multiple visits, I have eaten a wide variety from the menu
My favorites are: raw bar, crab cake appetizer, lamp porterhouse chops, rib-eye steak, and every side dish
My favorite dessert is the souffle, hands-down
The number one reason to go to Bar Americain is the AMAZING and FLAVORFUL food
But, I also enjoyed the other aspects of the experience
This is attributed to exemplary service, fun and hip bar scene and the magnificent decor
I probably have been to this restaurant at least 5 times already
I can't wait for my 6th!
Our service was terrible
The main dish was served before they'd even cleared the appetizers
And then we were virtually ignored for the rest of the evening until we asked for our check, which had a mistake on it
We had the hot potato chips as an appetizer
They were good, but not if you're expecting anything other than plain old potato chips with melted blue cheese to dip into
The asparagus and grilled bread salad was very good, as was the spinach side (the mushrooms and onions were nothing special)
I ordered the NY strip steak (rare) and can't remember the last time I had such a lousy steak
My friend was happy with his flank steak, and we both enjoyed the Gooseberry cocktails
All in all, I can't see going back for dinner
Maybe for another gooseberry at the bar after work
Flay's cooking is def an art form in many ways
Try the appetizer sampler on your first visit
Its a great way for two people to sample the master that is, Flay
Even Bobby's signature drinks are some very delectable recipes
The staff is attentive and quick
The aesthetic decor is much better than his other restaurants making Bar Americain the place to go to for some truly fabulous Flay fare
If you're lucky, you can see Bobby in the kitchen, overseeing everything goes off without a hitch and making sure that his place is on key and stays there
My boyfriend and I went for our second anniversary because we are fans of bobby flay
we had a great dinner at mesa grill previously so we wanted to experience bobby's other restaurants
it was overall a good meal, but we were disappointed when we ordered the raw bar selection
Our waiter did not warn us that the selection has enough food to feed at least four to eight people opposed to two
We ended up stuffing ourselves because we didn't want to waste anything so much that we couldn't enjoy our entrees
we recommend that you go to mesa grill instead where the service and selections are better
This restaurant rocks! I rarely do a repeat visit to restaurants but will be coming back to this one
I came here with a large group of friends and we all enjoyed our dinner so much and ate practically everything on the menu
The best part of this place is the all around experience: the food/wine are fantastic, the atmosphere is stunning, the service is excellent
I am going to be using this place for many occasions, esp for client meals/events
The steak, duck and soft shell crab are musts for dinner and almost every side dish was great
Desserts are good too, esp
the souffle and deep dish choc pie are amazing
Love this restaurant!
I wasn't expecting much from a restaurant that has been opened for a couple of weeks, but once we walked into this beautifully decorated large space we knew this place was trying to be more than you'd expect
The service was smooth and polite, and the food was expertly prepared
The vidalia onion soup is a must! We went with a group of four so i was able to try the steak, duck, and salmon and they were all fantastic but the superstar was the rack of pork with apple chutney
Get the hot potato chips with the blue cheese sauce
I'm already looking forward to returning
I typically don't get TOO enthusiastic about a place, but my expectations were exceeded with my recent experience there
I had a drink/appetizers at the bar (the most amazing Manhattan
beautifully made, highly recommend it) as well as the gulf shrimps/grits and the french fries
Maybe skip the fries (not really worth it, though they were undeniably delicious) but get the grits - very nice
The service was superb
Polite, professional, smooth, and caring (at the right level)
Definitely no attitude - just great people doing good work there and proud of it (and it's evident throughout)
I hope the place isn't too crowded the next time I want to go back!
Great place for a date! We were very impressed
The restaurant had been open for 4 days and we were able to get a seated as walk-ins
Decore is warm and colorful

The menu is original and very tasty for a variety of palates
It is a bit pricey so expect to pay 80-120 bucks for dinner for 2
The atmosphere is fun and lively
Also if you don't want to deal with a long wait, make reservations
You can usually get them early the same day
When you call the number, press 4 for reservations
If you get the recording hit 0 and it will ring the phone again
You can keep doing that until someone answers rather than trying to call back
I went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner to Sushi Samba but left feeling rushed out of the restaurant
Don't get me wrong, four young professionals aren't always the norm at some of the upper-class spots in NYC, but Sushi Samba seemed to be filled with other twentysomethings
The feeling of unwelcomeness was especially prevalent due to the fact that our waiter hovered over our table and immediately cleared the table of dishes and glasses, some of which were still full in order to get us out the door ASAP
This is a nice restaurant to meet a date for drinks, just don't expect stellar service or above average sushi
The Miso soup was on par with the mix I have at home, and the tuna roll was just okay
For what we paid ($180 for a party of four) I expected a better dining experience
this place has a vibrant young fun attitude which is great before going out
but you definitely give up service when the waiters act liek they're at some club
the drinks are great but verrry sugary (makes for a bad hangover), the crowd is young and hot but slightly trashy
the rolls are good but overpriced
the chicken teriyaki is surprisingly good
basically, good place but i would never go there unless im plannign on making a night of it
LOVED this place
From the unique decor, to the music, to the food
Close seating but not too close which is good
Great sushi
Great service
Two thumbs up with no hesitation
I had someone come in from out of town and this was by far our favorite choice
if you have never had food before
Ok, maybe that's a bit harsh
The food would have been fine if the prices were more in line with the quality
Everything sounds great on the menu and then when it arrives, you realize the $30 will procure an appetizer that you can see if you squint into your microscope just right
And it's almost good that you can't see the food because if you could, you'd realize were eating sushi that you could have bought at your local deli but with lime juice and a Brazilian name
Sushi Samba was tons of fun and very sceney, with a gorgeous rooftop dining area conducive to group dining
I visited this restaurant with a couple of friends for after-work dinner and drinks
The appetizers (especially the small crabs) were amazing! The entrees were divine, and the chocolate liqueur dessert was a MUST! The one factor that did set this restaurant apart was the SPARKLING SAKE - which I have never seen at any other restaurant - - - it was Amazing
Will I return? ABSOLUTELY
Sushi Samba ranks at the top of my fav restaurant lists!
If you want a place where you can eat and drink, see and to be seen, and fun chic ambiance sushi samba is the place to be plus, the prices arent high
It is very reasonable
My boyrfriend and I had dinner at Sushi Samba when we were visiting NY city
It was a very nice experience; food was just awsome - it was one of the best sushi I've ever had
Service was even better; our server was very nice and very attentive
He recommended the best drinks and sure enough they were really good
We were seated at a round booth table, which was very romantic
We're definitely going there on our next visit to NY!
The food was excellent on Friday night - the drinks are eh, ok, but at least they aren't ridiculously priced
The ambiance is amazing - I don't think that people were too snobby there - The waiter was kind, however, we had major problems with getting our food in the correct order timing - We ordered soup to go with dinner, but it came out before the appetizer, then the appetizer came out 30 min later, My dinner was served first (Tuna special - $39 - AMAZING!) - then my boyfriends came 15 min later - the rice that was ordered was forgotten - and drinks were mostly late coming
The manager did comp $23 off of our $140 meal, so they were aware of their mistakes - therefore, I will give it another chance - the food was too yummy! Make sure to make reservations
although the food was good, the wait was so long; extremely snobby about seating you, we waited 45 min + for our reservation
This location is best during the summer when you can dine/drink on the roof
The downstairs offers colorful, modern decor but upstairs is where the scene really is, especially in the summer
They play islandly, energizing music in the main dining room
Japanese food is inventive and prepared with a twist but, not really to my liking
The fushion entrees and appetizers are very good
Plus, be sure to try authentic Brazillian drinks like the Caipirinha as you'll be hard pressed to find that anywhere else
Make reservations during prime dining hours
Best cocktails in the city, try the nina fresca yummy delicious food and fantastic server
I had a great time at sushi samba, the sea bass miso skewers are to die for and the sashimi seviches are absolutely exquisite
My server was in one word awesome, thanks Fatu
The roof deck at Sushi Samba, while crowded, is a lovely place to sit and have a drink after work on a nice day
The cocktails are a little pricey but probably at the going rate for a trendy spot in Manhattan - $10-$15
When it's not crowded, the service is very attentive
However, when packed, beware
We were practically ignored after the restaurant filled up, and had to chase the waitress to get the bill
The food is tasty, but too pricey
For better/more/cheaper sushi, go to Aki or one of the other neighborhood spots
the food here is horrible
the service is even worse
the only reason to come is to be seen
do not eat here if you're hungry and want a decent meal
its good for drinks but thats about it
Birthday dinner for my lady today
We sat swiftly, but the service was a hoax, we sat in a way that caused us to endure a steady stream of posterior in our faces, and the food was positively embarrassing
Having never been there we tried the 5 course Omisake (sp?), and were floored at the gall of the establishment to serve such nonsense for the price
Upon our visibly disgruntled farewell, not even the faintest acknowledgement from management (Thanks for coming, goodnite, get lost
nada!)
Never, EVER again!
Sushi Samba does well because of it's name, but honestly I think the place is overrated
The decor isn't anything spectacular and the food portions are extremely small for the price that you pay
There's nothing like having a cucumber cocktail on the roof deck to put you in the mood for summer
But I'm glad we stayed for dinner tooevery course was delicious
A must-try is the manchego/shitake mushroom empanada
The sushi was super-fresh and inventive, some unusual combinations
Somehow, we made room for a chocolate fondue dessert (suggested by our server) and it did not disappointthe crunchy rice crispies were so good with the chocolate
An excellent evening all around
I love both locations but there is nothing like that first warm evening on the roof at Sushi Samba 7! The cucumber shosu (sp!) cocktail is so refreshing and is the perfect compliment to a beautiful array of sushi and sashimi
I had not been there in a while and it was nice to know the service and the food remains steller! Everything from the warm empanadas to the seviche and sea bass was divine
And even when we thought we couldn't possibly have dessert, the warm chocolate fondue recommended by our server was amazing
so inventive and delicious
the perfect end to a perfect evening
looking forward to more roof top fun
I absolutely loved it
SUSHISAMBA has been my favorite restaurant for the past 4 years and every time I go back they never disappoint
The cocktails are just to die for I especially loved their brand new creation Inti
As for the food the seviche and tiraditos are really fresh and really great substitute for sushi
I also loved the moqueca and the chocolate fondue at the end was a perfect finale to another amazing evening
Our server was really great and knowledgeable everything he recommended was delicious! I'll be back soon!
If you would have asked me a year ago for a restaurant recommendation I would have suggested Sushi Samba 7
While the atmosphere is still pretty cool, the kitchen has gone WAY DOWN HILL
The sushi is no longer as fresh as it used to be, the red snapper with coconut rice tastes like cheapo Thai, and the dishes are no longer uniquely and elegantly plated

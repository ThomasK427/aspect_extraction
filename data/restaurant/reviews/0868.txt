Toro (in season) melts in your mouth
And, on top of it all, it is cheap--sushi for two with sake and dessert can be $40-50
I lived in the heights for a year before I found Iron Chef
Tucked away down Clark, off of Henry, is one of the better sushi restaurants that I've been to-- Manhattan or Brooklyn
The House rolls are unique and served in huge portions
The Green Paper roll (tuna and eel, wrapped in green paper with tobico), the Osaka (shirmp tempura wrapped in eel) and the Yellow Dragon (yellow tail, shrimp, and flying fish roe) are amazing
In all probably 15 house rolls, 10 traditional rolls (yellow tail, eel tempoura, california roll, etc)
Sushi and sushimi good quality, fresh, and tasty
Miso, seaweed salad, tempura, all excellent
Sushi snob or no, this place is great
If you're in the Heights, you know how hard it is to find great places to eat
Iron Chef would be good eats no matter what part of the city it was in
Kiarara has fantastic, fresh sushi and is very well-priced - especially considering the quality
They are always friendly and accommodating
Being a sushi afficionado I've tried sushi in just about half the places in nyc (and some in queens/brooklyn)
and this is probably the best
The menu is not very large, the places specializes in sashimi
There are no fancy rolls here, just the freshest and most flavourful raw fish I've tasted
Sashimi and handrolls (especially shrimp tempura) are much better then in more expensive and known places like Yama or Haru (MUCH better then haru)
Even their home-made green tea is delicous
The decour is nothing special (if compared to Haru) but very pleasant and much more stylish then your average sushi joint
I've been here five times now and it's always great
The fish is very, very fresh and delicious
The owners and staff are really friendly and the vibe is great, creative but not pretentious
Probably the best sushi I've had in the village
AMAZING sushi, sooo fresh and delicious
Friendly and attentive wait staff, and cute atmosphere
This is a great hole in the wall sushi place
I'll admit the atmosphere/decoration isn't anything to write home about, but the sushi was amazing
It looks like a typical sushi restaurant on the inside - nothing special
There aren't wild and crazy rolls on the menu, but a pretty standard listing
However, the fish was extremely fresh and this place ranks up there with the best sushi we've had in the City
Sushi are fresh and imaginative
White tuna (as a salad, or sushi, or an appetizer) is just to die for
It has great texture and smokey flavor
I go there all the time
At $18/dozen, these cookies are very pricy
I had the perfect, expresso bean, kitchen sink, and oatmeal
While they were VERY good, soft chewey, buttery
I'm torn as to whether it is worth the price
I think they make a nice gift, but are definitely too expensive for everyday consumption
On the plus side, 5% of their profit is donated to Mount Sinai hospital
The shop is really cute and boutiquey
The woman running the shop was extremely sweet
The food here is amazing
It is so nice to go to a cozy restaurant with good service and very fair prices with such excellent food
The quatro formaggi is the best pizza Ive ever had as well as the truffle pizza
And their entrees are great too
I could eat here every night
Use to dine at Bella Via on a regular basis before we moved out of the city last spring
Great food, cordial service, elegant yet comfotable surroundings, moderate prices, plus convenient on-street parking (it's also just up the street from the Vernon/Jackson stop on the 7 train)
We loved this place
Went back for the first time in nine months on a recent trip into the city
It's even better than we remembered
Free range chicken with artichoke hearts was terrific and we've always liked their Caesar salad
It was the perfect end to a fun day in the city
I have bee to Bella Via numerous times and each time it is incredible
The food is delicious
The staff is very friendly
The decor is great
Did I mention the food is DELICIOUS? The spinach gnocchi and the steak gargonzola are out of this world
You have to finish off with the Tiramisu
It is great for all occassions
You are guaranteed to love this place
I have had many wonderful dinners in Bella Via's cozy dining room--I have taken friends, family, and out-of-town guests there, and everyone always agrees that the food is delicious
In addition, the staff is totally charming and the atmosphere is mellow and comfortable
For a romantic dinner, or just a meal out with friends, I have found Bella Via has suited every occassion
And taking a walk out to the nearby piers after the meal makes the whole evening complete
I recommend the spinach linguine with spinach, pancetta and peas
And the minestrone
best cuban sandwitch in the city
the service was really slow, but it was worth it
so far, everything else i tried was good, but not notable, but a good value
Seriously, the shrimp soupy rice is amazing
The chicken is cheaper and better value, but the shrimp is fabulous
Staff are friendly
it's a good local for a low price
The fish is so very fresh, delivered everyday
Everything just melts in your mouth
Absolutely the best sushi/sashimi I've ever had
Every friend I've brought there agrees that the sushi is the best they've had too
For some reason though, take out is not as tasty as eating in
It's prepared differently
I'm spoiled now
I find eating sushi anywhere else has been a disappointment after this place!!
Waiters were not attentive
Food was bad not authentic japanese sushi
We found this place after getting of the ferry from Statue of Liberty
We were cold and ready for a place warm up
Cafe New World had an excellent variety of food, pannini sandwiches, buffet bar, coffee, hot chocolate, desserts
Wi-Fi internet access available too
Saturday AM ritual
The fresh NYC bagel
Not as stupid-large as Pick-A-Bagel, but a healthy size
With toppings, they can get pricey
Jerry's fare is not what you would call delicate
But more often than not it is delicious
We order from Jerry's at least once a week and although there have been some duds, most of the time the food is tasty, filling and a good value
Some of our favorite items are the BBQ chicken and the chicken teriyaki and hot fudge sundae
The Gyros should be avoided

I especially crave the Foie Gras appetizer- it's AMAZING! Does anyone have the recipe???
The place is beat
I've had better steaks at Sizzler
The drinks aren't that bad, and the service is alright
Also, it's an upscale frat lounge with promoters
Then again, I guess it's cool cause J-Lo went there
Come on, seriously
The Park is one of my fav places in the city
Thursdays are always a great time - love the rooftop patio
Always a cool crowd - fun music, can't go wrong
I went here late at night, after dinner, but the outdoor upstairs area was lots of fun on a summer evening
We knew the bouncer so we didnt have to wait
Always a cool crowd, great food and the best frozen drinks that we've had anywhere
It's great to see a place that's so cool and trendy remain a fun place to go
The outside space is the best place to hang out on a beautiful night!
The bar area and decor is great and the food is good, too
I had the best octopus appetizer
The service, however, is poor
And why was it so damn hot inside? I hate sweating while I eat
Went to The Park on Friday night for dinner
The decor is ultra trendy with high ceilings, paper lantern fixtures, and a huge tree growing in the middle of the restaurant
The epitome of what a New York restaurant should be with a mix of uptown class and downtown cool minus the attitude
The bar is great with a bunch of good-looking, trendy people
The food was surprisingly excellent; note to try the crab and spicy pasta
They even have my favorate red wine Sharaz
I was throughly impressed
One of the hotspots right now
This converted taxi garage on 10th avenue in Chelsea is gorgeous
huge beautiful bar boasting every type of alcohol you could possibly imagine and beautiful people everywhere; its even a little intimidating
The food was better than expected for a place this trendy, though we did have to wait for our table for about 40 minutes and we had a reservation
The waitress was fine, and the best deal was the chicken and the pitcher of sangria, which are both around $20
Drinks are good, but of course expensive, and the garden looks like it would be the spot to dine
The Bowery B Bar guys strike again
for the bridge tunnel crowd
This extravagently decorated spot should be a hit, but the over-the-top prices and only almost good food, coupled with a pack of poseurs make the Park less than idyllic
Deliciously hip decor and a sprawling patio make the Park one of Manhattan's most delightfully flamboyant places to see and be seen
While the dishes we ordered were tasty and well prepared, the menu in general doesn't pack a lot of culinary excitement -- not really a surprise for a sceney place like this
However, I didn't mind that nearly as much as all the women throwing up in the bathroom, which is completely stocked with toothpaste, mouthwash, gum and candy
pretty garden and the food is ok, but the drama at the door can be a hassle
Visited The Park with birthday party for 7; great atmosphere, but the food was aweful!!!!! I could've done better with my frozen entrees, especially when considering I could've bought about 15 for what I paid
One would think that 1 out of 7 of us would have been pleased with our entree, but that definitely wasn't the case
Dessert and mojitos were the only enjoyable part of the meal
I have visited Park a few times but never for dinner
I was a little skeptical about how the food and service would be after reading all the reviews
I made reservations and when we arrived we were seated promptly outside in the garden
Our waiter could not have been nicer! The menu could be a little bigger but my food as well as my boyfriend's was outstanding (and a lot less expensive than I expected)
Afterwards we headed over to the bar for a few more drinks before ending our night upstairs
All in all I had a wonderful time and will definitely be back!
I would recommend this place for brunches (the garden is excellent for this)
Fridays can be very busy with the 20-something-we-are-hugely-entitled-to-be-as-loud-as-possible yuppie crowd
Yes, the hostesses can be slow and/or downright rude - where do they find them? So many people have said this and after eating there three times Im afraid I have to agree
Someone should show them the reviews on this site - enough with the attitude!
This place combines eating, drinking and dancing all at one stop
After your meal you can head on back to the bar or hang outside and then move further up for a little more action (if you can manage to get by the guy at the steps)
Good place for an early night out or to get you ready for a night out on the town
Spotted Matt Dillon there once, too
Three girlfriends and I had dinner here Saturday, 6/8, and we had a wonderful time
The host was friendly, we were seated immediately (we had reservations) and we had a great view (right by the open doors leading to the patio)
Our drink waiter was as helpful as he was handsome, and he even came back to check on us during our meal (I had a great Shiraz)
Our dinner waiter was also attentive and courteous and our food was delivered promptly and was delicious
The bar is also a must after dinner: have a raspberry martini!
The patio is a great place for a weekend brunch
With it's giant plantings and heating stands, it's like taking a daytrip to L
A
finally made it to Magnolia, enjoyed their outdoor seating on this quiet corner
attentive service, romantic vibe, were more impressed with the food than we anticipated after reading some of these posts
it's a welcoming, friendly place, with solid food and nice beer selection
we live close by and somehow never managed to try it
Glad we did now
I love the staff and the drinks! Brian's the best bartender! It's kind of like my version of Cheers!
The guy before me must be the owner or disgruntled worker of either this restaurant or it's competition
The food is oppisite of sub-par and for the price, it is well thought out and well executed
If you are too cheap to occasionally go beyond the well-stocked prixe fixe menue, you can always sample choices on the small dishes or just get a friggen incredible value on the huge ridiculous cowboy steak
This place is horrid
The food is sub-par, the service is completely unprofessional and it is way too expensive
There are a hundred awesome restaurants in the Slope, so don't waste your evening here
I tried the price fix and te waiter looked offended when I requested the price fix menu
Moreover, food was a complete disappointment
It had no flavor, was poorly prepared and lacked any culinary vision
I tried the place again for the Monday night pizza and pint special and it was even worse
You had to sit at the bar for the special where the Bar tender did his best to ignore all clientel he had not previously met
The pizza was THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD
It was a matzo cracker with cheese and sauce
It was so bad that it was offensive
Never go here
Neighbourhood's little secret on 6th Ave
may be somtimes overlooked, but for those who haven't dined yet at Magnolia ,one word , run! The place has such delicious food you have to try it yourself to categorize it(they dry age their steaks on premises),the space is very cozy and filled witha warm glow, good service and value while still getting quality, they even have live music, and in a warm weather tables out front, once you sit down you'll never want to leave
This is where I go to relax and unwinde, even when they are packed on weekends the atmospher is less hectic than in most of the restaurants I have been to
Another plus -you could come with anyone,young or old, shy,or fun loving, the staff is friendly and accomodating
I could go on but I couldn't say enough
Do something nice for yourself, go to Magnolia
Excellent food - brunch or dinner
Quiet, romantic atmosphere
Nice outdoor space
Friendly, prompt service
Recently moved to park slope and have enjoyed several good meals at Magnolia
The prix fixe menu is extremly good value
The service was of a high standard and this restaurant will be seeing me more
Magnolia offers a three-course, $20 prix fixe dinner menu (everyday, I think, but it may be weekdays only)
As one might expect, the fixed price menu is limited to chicken- and salmon-like dishes, so if you want something more special you'll have to pay a little more

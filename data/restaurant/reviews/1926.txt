I had a great time dining here
there are many unique menu items (including daily specials) ranging from Nova Scotian bear to kangaroo loin to emu carpaccio
If you're an adventurous meat/game eater, this place is for you
The only drawback - prices are a bit on the high end for a laid-back type place like this
Although the staff was awesome - super informative and friendly!!
I had dinner here with a few friends recently, and while I must admit that the food and service was okay, the prices simply did not match the environment and cuisine
Eleven bucks for dessert?Stick with the downstairs area and just order drinks
The Australian beer and wine selection is good
I got some attitude when I tried to get a glass of wine to replace the one I'd been served, which had chunks -- as in, large pieces -- of cork floating in it
Then my friend and I were asked to change tables not once, but twice, from the back garden to a table inside, then to a table closer to the bar, for no discernible reason
Not okay
We finished wine and appetizers and got out of there
to be honest we only had drinks and appetizers downstairs as we were there for a collegues leaving drinks but the staff was very friendly (typical aussies) and the food i did have was pretty darn good
i checked out the menu from upstairs and it looks eclectic with some antipodean tidbits like kangaroo? all in all seems like a good place but didnt make it in to the top tier of dining musts in NYC given the mix of food and the ambience which was a little uninspiring in a good relaxed no pretense way but also lacked a real draw
charming, cozy and DELICIOUS
i recommend starting with the kanga skewers
followed by either the lamb or the lobster ravioli
really yummy! the ambiance is very relaxing and the wine lovely
highly recommended
This wonderful find has been THE favorite of the past two years - and it tops the list of things I'll miss when I leave this lovely city
The best bar, the best staff, the best patrons, and *sniff* the best service in the city
Whether you're there for a pint and the jukebox downstairs, or a glass of one of their gorgeous Aussie wines and an inventive, and always stunning dinner in the garden - you'll be back as often as I have
I went to 8MC frequently last summer, and loved the spare, minimal decor and the odd collection of music they played
It's changed, but the attitude is still friendly and laid-back
It's a great place for a group of friends
The drinks are nice and eclectic
The bar is a nice neighborhood spot
This is my 2nd time dining here, and it's still very good! I loved the Sweet Potato Fries with an excellent sweet pepper sauce, Smoked Emu was very lean and paired perfectly with leeks, while Kangaroo Tartar was definitely an intense experience (Eat it with the bread!)
As for entrees, the Rack of Lamb rules (Tender at medium) the Barramundi, a whitefish, was grilled just right with a crispy skin
Dessert: Sticky Date Pudding, although sweet and cake-like is unbeatable! Plus, the homemade icecream scores high points from me!
In Short Founded in 1954, this ultracasual eatery (often with a drive-through) made its name with hamburgers cooked over flames and finished with the customer's choice of toppings
The signature sandwich has always been the Whopper, a quarter-pound burger with tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, ketchup, pickles and onions
The menu also features fish fillets and spicy chicken sandwiches, garden salads with fire-grilled shrimp and chicken, the breakfast "Croissan'wich," crispy onion rings and even veggie burgers
This Burger King is like any other Burger King food-wise
Depending on what time you go, you may have to eat with loud tourists
Me, I would like to add the big gulp from 7-eleven
Add to that a whopper from bk, fries from mcdonalds, and that would be heaven
The Scene Whitewashed walls and open shelving units give this dining room an old-fashioned feel
Rustic touches like unlit lanterns, wooden barrels and wine jugs complete the impression
Though lunch is busy with nearby office workers, tables fill with a local crowd at night
The Food The unusual Argentinian-Italian mix on the menu makes sense once you learn that Italian immigrants arrived in Argentina at the turn of the last century and significantly impacted the local cuisine
A hearty pasta with lamb is offered alongside delectably prepared steaks (for which the country is better-known)
The polenta--which accompanies entrees and appetizers--is especially good with its crispy exterior concealing tender cornmeal porridge
After dinner, any dessert featuring dulce de leche will drive caramel-lovers mad with delight
I was looking for argentinean and this is not the place to hace authentic argentinean
I Do not recomend this restaurant as and authentic argentinean
That is not an Arg
restaurant, there's no way that is
Food, forget it no empanadas?! The menu is one page?! They forgot most of the argentinian dishes
Wine list with no Arg
wines, most of the wines from Europe
That wasn't an Argentinian restaurant, and I am sorry but there isn't a second chance to make a first impression
Cute place, good service
The food was good although a bit overpriced
Very tight space - if you are looking for a private conversation you won't have it here - you are practically sitting with the people at the next table
Try to get there early when it's not that crowded
I've eaten there twice
The first time, the parmesian crusted chicken was nothing but a chicken cutlet
The homemade chocolate desert wasn't amazing
But, again, it was solid
I didn't mind it
The second experience was worse
The Lasagna was oily, bland, and soggy
The steaks have gotten great reviews (the Argentinian's can do that correctly)
You feel like you are in Italy when you eat there
It's cozy and relaxing with offering of friendly (quite American more so than Argentinian) menu
Very good food, a terrific lunch spot (to avoid the Salomon bankers' crowd, go on weekends) and the best fries in town
I've consistantly used Sosa Borella as my secret romantic weapon, and it never fails to impress me
Great Argentine food, with a nice cozy old world environment
The staff is always freidnly and polite
Make sure you get reservations for Valentine's Day
It fills up a few weeks ahead of time
Excellent restaurant
I have had Argentinean food but adding a taste of Italy makes the food delightful
Good place to have a quiet time with someone special
A good meal for 2 with a bottle of wine runs ~$100
Not bad for such an exquisite food
Ill go back next time Im in NY
Excellent place
Romantic, but casual and relaxing
Went there with a friend and had a great time as one can have eating a delicious combination of flavors of Argentina and Italy, and sipping on a sangria
(wine for me)
Definately to come back with a significant other
I've always liked this place
Jammed in a edgy section of Tribeca, almost out of place in its location
The food seems like home cooking, in this neighborhood place
Doesn't seem to attract tourists and BT
The parmasean crusted chicken breast is amazing
The Scene The only thing that greets John Hung's customers before he does is the scent of green tea and banana leaves
There's a small juice bar, dry goods, and a fine selection of dim sum--but little room to move--in this delightful shop
The Food Try the savory tarts filled with curried beef or barbecued pork and baked in a Western-inspired puff pastry--a great alternative to pizza
There's a good selection of steamed buns, the popular Chinese dim sum item; also pork, shrimp, mushroom, black bean, and lotus seed
Green tea pastry dough filled with sweetened red bean paste is tasty, but the texture might not be for everyone
Whatever you do, don't leave without a "Chinese tamale"--sweet sticky rice molded around fillings like Chinese sausage and chestnut, and steamed in banana leaves
I think I really like about May May's food is that all their packaged dim-sums have very detailed ingredient list and nutritional facts so you know what you are actually eating
They even list sth you expect them to hide, such as MSG
I tried the red bean buns and vegan wontons
I must say I'd had better ones but I will go back for the price and service
There are alot of tourists that come to nyc's chinatown but fail to stop by May May's because of it's hidden location
Their windows are jumbled up with all the merchandise they sell and the tiny entrance they have, fails to attract tourists

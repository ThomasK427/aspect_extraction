The food was incredible
Great fresh fish
And prepared any way you want
If its not on the menu, they are happy to accomodate
Do not go if you are in a rush, as half the fun is the people watching, an the bar scene
And an FYI to people who cant understand the name, Atlantic Grill is about fish
If you want steak, go to Lugers
When there is so much GREAT food in New York, why go for the high-priced mediocre meal? I think we picked the place because it was around the corner from someone's house
The restauarnt is Ok in terms of decor, but the food was really lacking - things were not cooked to order
Tuna was overdone
One of the reviews here sounds like it was written by their PR firsm, not people who have eaten there
Even Docks further downtown is better
They seem to do the same volume, but are better
This was like Banquet food
I absolutely Loved this place
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in
Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation
The wine list is also really nice
Tuesday evening with some friends out for dinner, at this delicious highly reccomended restaurant on Houston street serving older Southern Italian dishes,superbly crafted and al dente pasta's
the wine list is well organized and very reasonably priced
You can drink some old world Italian Chianti for less then what a retailer would charge you
Service is nice and Friendly
the staff mmust had work there for ever @ MUST Try in the city !! Super !
Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food
some of the best i have had in the city
the ambience is cozy and secluded with wonderful art on the walls
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window)
Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
Yes
It is what it is let's all scream loud and give credit to this Old fashion Italian restaurant ina suburbed area of houston street
If this place would be in midtown or somwhere fancy
forget it !! would double it's value
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list
Covers all of the best area of Italy and many are the selections
hops
Lenny Kravitz just walked in
well i know why is such a good place to eat and relax ! Bravissimo !!
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm
everything is just delicious
Check out the secret back room
Old school meets New world
I pray it stays open forever
Thank You Emilio
Ciao Bella
You will aboslutely enjoy the food and service at this consumer friendly restaraunt
Emilio makes sure that you have the best time at his establishment! I would recommend this restaraunt to anyone seeking a very nice Italian dinner and great service!!! Keep up the great work!!!
I've eaten at Ballato's a dozen or more times over the years
both lunch and dinner
Bottom line: Their food is some of the best Italian I've ever had
(Born and raised New Yorker) Try the ravioli
It's light and always fresh
I've never had a bad meal nor a bad expereience at Ballatos and I look forward to my next dinner there in a few weeks
Thanks Emelio
don't change a thing
Ciao!
Very good primarily southern italian food, though considerably more sophisticated than a typical red sauce joint
As mentioned above, the prices are not inexpensive, especially the wine list which could definitely add a few lower priced bottles, but they are what i'd expect for a restaurant of this caliber and style
The portions are big so you can split an appetizer
Has a very nice warm lofty look for ambience and i really liked the menu choices
The service is a little disjointed and the desserts are mediocre, but I'll definitely go back
We invited people to this restaurant thinking it was not ultra-expensive
Not sure why this place got $$, but it's more like $$$$
Not one bottle of wine was less then $35
No big deal to spend the money, but it's nice to know what to expect, esp
when you are inviting people there
While visiting NYC my fiance and I were looking for some down home Italian Cooking, similar to Tommosso's in SF
(if you're ever in SF and you want good Italian eats - it's a MUST- don't be fooled by Steps of Rome persuasions) Anyway - WE FOUND IT
Ballato's - great homelike atmosphere, prompt staff, good service, and the food was excellent
This place does not have to try, it simply is what it is
Good people and good food with reasonable prices
Everyone should try Ballato's once, thats all it takes
If you aren't hooked, you don't know Italian food
From the opera playing in the background, to Emilio, the owner wishing everyone a good meal, this should be the highest rated Italian restaurant in the city
Simply the best food in the city!!
I went to Ballato's with friend and have been there 4 times this month
Overall, this is the best itallian resturant in manhattan
food, service, ambience, etc
nobody beats this place!
I just got back from dinner from this UES hotspot - it is like a home away from home - delicious meals and a salad dressing that sometimes they let me have a tiny container of for my lunch at work salads - the price/ atmosphere/ cocktails (FULL BAR!!! Including ABSOLUT PEACH@@@) was beyond unbeatable and they have Brazilian dishes too - my friend loved it - Enjoy!!!
Nothing special about this place
Basic pastas, average prices
If that's what you want, Bardolino is as good as anywhere else
There's nothing special about it though
The food is GREAT and they have a wide variety of pasta and meat dishes
Eveything I have tried here has been fabulous
This restaurant is only a few blocks away from me but I keep coming back becasue I am never disappointed with their food
The salads and vegtables are fresh and yummy
The price is also very reasonable
I have to agree with the service comment before though--it can be great or so-so
Th restaurant had a major makeover in 2004 and now is much bigger
JUST A NOTE--they have a full bar and wine service now
If you are looking for a romatic getaway--well this might not be the first place to stop by
But if you are hanging out with friends, family or collegues--it has great food and reasonably priced
Bardolino is half a block from my boyfriend's apt which is probably the only reason we even went in the first place
but I'm glad we did! We've only eaten at the restaurant once but have ordered take-out at least once every two weeks

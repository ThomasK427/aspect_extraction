I then ordered their greek lemon soup which was out of this world
I then had the best bacon cheeseburger I've ever had
I definitely have made this one of my stops when I'm in the city
It's a family owned restaurant and it definitely gives off a warm feeling
I love this place! The food is as good as a number of Italian restaurants in the area yet costs considerably less
Perhaps that is why it tastes better
The service is attentive but not fawning
I went to another restaurant nearby today because of a recommendation (Fagiolina), and it was an awful experience
The service was terrible, the food tasteless and the prices are comparable
I can't believe they have the same 9
0 rating! Go to Sam's Place and be pampered and well-fed
You will have a wonderful dining experience
I went here on a personal recomendation
Sam's Place is an excellent restaurant
The chicken parmesan was delicious and the chocolate cake was to die for
The prices are low, so a customer can get an appetizer, entree and desert for what most fancy restaurants charge for and entree alone
The staff was very friendly and served us promptly
We will go back again soon
We;ve been looking for a good Italian place in Murray Hill, and we found it when we stumbled into Sam's Place!! Tremendous food, gregarious staff, owner is a terrific guy, and the best part is a lot of food for a great price!
We live up the block and stopped by Sam's for dinner based on a recommendation
GREAT FOOD! We were welcomed in by the entire staff especially the owner
This will be our new neighborhood spot for guaranteed great food for a great price!! Go there, I promise you won't be disappointed!
Service was fantastic, meal was delicious
Price was great too
Highly recommend to anyone
Happened on Sam's Place by chance
We had excellent veal parmigiana and veal piedmontese (sp?)
Our bill total was only $30 and our waiter threw in a side of linguini (no charge) since the entrees don't come with pasta sides
The restaurant was romantic though a bit small unless they also seat upstairs
The service was amazingly prompt and we were never overlooked
I stumbled upon this place TWICE
The first time I found the place I LOVED it
The food, service, drinks
everything was excellent
I was very upset that I didnt take a business card to remember the place
Then another night I stumbled upon the place again, and AGAIN i had a wonderful dinning experience
I was there one Friday night with my Girlfriend let me tell you something that was the Best Italian Restaurant in the City, The service was Excellent, the food was great  I really enjoyed  Coppolas seeee You soon
It was freezing last night and instead of going to an E
Village italian restaurant, waiting in the cold, we went down the block to Coppola's
What a pleasant night out
The staff was helpful, the food was very good and the ambiance was great
The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce rich
The veal chop parm was by far the best
Enjoy
We visit this spot on occasion to indulge in the rich foods and warm decor
We love the buttery clams and the cheese and tomato bruschetta (drenched in olive oil) to start
My boyfriend special orders the Penne ala Vodka topped with slow cooked steak meat
At $19 it is just divine
He loves it
I usually order something different every time I go
The staff is especially helpful and informative
The pizzas are very fine and make great leftovers
I've yet tried anything I didn't like there
Usually we will order in from Coppolas, but we decided to go in the other night to check out the restaurant since the recent rennovation
Everything was terrific
The staff is very accommodating, the restaurant looks beautiful, the food is consistently excellent, and the wine list is very impressive
Thanks to Benny to getting me hooked on red wine
My boyfriend appreciates it
the service is very poor which ruined the dining expierence, not reccomended
I was there on a Saturday night, Dec 18th with a few of my friends
Although there was a 30 min wait I didn't mind because I was able to sit at the bar and have some drinks while talking to the beautiful, charming hostess there
Because of her I barely noticed the wait
She was so kind and accommodating as well as the rest of the staff at this fine restaurant
Once seated we received our food right away and wow
it was delicious! I definitely recommend dining at Coppolas!
Coppolas East is a favorite
Prices are reasonable, food is very good, and service is outstanding
They are willing to make any Italian favorites not on the menu that you are craving
Do not go to this restaurant unless you like paying high prices for small protions, ordering a drink that arrives 20 minutes later, or ordering a meal only to get the side dish 5 minutes after you're done
The someiller could have cared less about what our wine tastes were; he was only interested in selling us a $220 bottle of wine
Probably THE WORST dining experience I've had in a VERY long time
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
This place was alright
Too well light in the back, but the food was good
Nice sizes
Dinner for 2 will run you about 100 with a bottle of wine
and the selection isn't the best
My boyfriend and I frequently go to Coppola's since we think they have the best Penne Alla Vodka in Manhattan
We have been to both locations, on the East and West side, and the food and service are outstanding
The prices are very reasonable as well
Decent cuisine, fast service and you can always get a table
This is a place we go to regularly when we want decent, quick food and don't want to wait around for a table
Don't order beer, though, as they charge $7 a bottle for Taj Mahal!
In Short A sexy air pervades this red-walled, dimly lit restaurant
Sure, the midtown employees and neighborhood residents are looking less for romance and more for kebabs, dolma, and baklava
And, true, the diners aren't exactly feeding each other vine leaves
But colorful, illuminated martinis on the bar and chairs covered in crimson cloth up the sophistication factor
Perhaps that's why couples and co-workers alike have kept this rice-happy, lamb-loving eatery open for more than a decade
I am a customer this restaurant since openning
Before for dinning you should have reservetion 2 weeks advance, it was great food and great service, but food is not same before and service is terrible
I love Turkish food
When i come to city i always try diffirient Turkish Restaurant
When i goto Turkish Kitchen First hostess was very rude
And we order some appetizer
Appetizers were not fresh
We couldnt eat it, also, we try shish kebab for main course, meat is very salty and its not soft u cant eat it
I called owner or Manager but no one come to my table for excuse
We will never go That place again
I had the opportunity to go there with a group of friends last week
The staff was rude and the service was exceptionally poor

We give the lovely hostess our name and she tells us it would be a 20 minute wait for a party of 5
No Problem, we say
Meanwhile a party of 7 comes in after us and gets seated before us
This was after waiting for 40 minutes
1st mistake! When questioned about it, the response from our lovely hostess was that it was easier to seat them because they had to put 2 tables together for them
(Go figure!) The best part of our dining experience was, when our burgers were ordered with NOTHING on them, and they came with some mysterious Houston's secret hickory sauce! What part of NOTHING ON IT do we not understand? To top it off, when we mentioned it to our lovely waitress, she responded as though it was no big deal along with Well now you know for the next time
How about there will be no next time? 2nd mistake
Needless to say, this place has gone to the extreme bottom of our list
You said 30 bucks for crabcakes is ok for a place known for food, but houstons? Apparently, you've never had the crabcakes at houstons
One of the best receipes in the city for crabcakes lives right here
I'd let you be the judge, but you'd probably just end up going with a couple of salads
Ridicilous, making a reservation on a busy evening for a New York steakhouse and then ordering a salad
Obviously, you have no sense of eating out
At all
AT ALL
This Houston's does take reservations, and we made a reservation for 7:15pm
Downhill from there; we arrived at 7:20, the hostess said you are late - but we will try to seat you as soon as we can
The menu is a bit bizarre
Aps and Sides are in the same column, and of those the only true ap is a tuna dish at $16 (strangely, they call the spinach dip an ap)
The rest of the menu is also very expensive for what it is, $30 for crabcakes is ok at a restaurant known for its food, but at Houstons? We both had salads, good but so 1990
Servers are very pleasant, but the average brought down by the smugness of the hostesses
Nice ambience--had the thai steak noodle salad and was delicious and spicey! My friend at the veggie burger, which was HUGE! He is a vegetarian and said it was one of the best veggie burgers he has ever had
Try the Arnold Palmer
mix of lemonade and iced tea
tasty!
Dined on a Sunday night and there was only a 5 minute wait
Food and service was not as good as in the past
They appear to be taking themselves a bit too seriously (I was told twice to remove my hat in the dining room)
Pricing is strange, too
Burger for $15, ribs for $30? Maybe I'm just annoyed about the hat thing
This Houstons has been one of my favorites and frequents from 1999
Last two times I went since October 2005, I was sadly dissappointed
The menu has changed and chef
I brought a date there raving about it and was embarrassed when we left
Don't get me wrong, it is still the gorgeous dining room, trendy bar, and great staff
But the food has taken a nosedive to what Houstons used to be
That is why the previous reviews were so wonderful, FYI
My mother and I were walking when we saw this place
We decided to have lunch here and could not have made a better decision
The food was excellent, the service, amazin
I really enjoyed this place and I will definately return! I highly recommend dining here! Quite simply
It's just plain amazing!
I walked in this restaurant and was amazingly surprised when the food arrived
Not only was the waiter attentive but the food was to die for
We got there around 5pm and it wasn't packed which was a plus
The dim light and decor made you feel at home
I ordered the crabcakes and my god! I haven't had crabcakes like that anywhere else just delicious
I guess the prime rib is what people go for
I will take my boyfriend there for his birthday for sure since he loves those
I guess i will have to order the spinach dip as well since everyone is raving about it
All in all I think this was an all-round great restaurant which doesn't look like a typical chain rest
I didnt even know it was
Which if you asked me is a silly reason not to visit it
If you are traveling from outside the area this is not the restaurant for you
I called to see if I could get reservations or be placed on wait list via phone because I was having 4 guests coming in from out of town on business
I spoke with the management and they basically told me no
Infact, he recommended Morton's which is located next door
That tells you something
I generally don't like chains, but this has got to be one of the best
I recently tried their burgers that everyone was raving about but I didn't like it
It was big, sloppy, and the bread was so soggy
Almost everything else on their menu is good though
Friendly service
The service is perfect
The Food is perfect
The price for what you get is perfect
We go once a week now
It's the best houstons arond
By far the best prime rib I have ever had as well as the bet Chicken sandwich my wife had
The atmosphere is set up elegantly and is very romantic
We had a booth table which is what you'd want to ask for
The service was superb
It is pricey but my wife and I enjoyed a great Lunch for under 40 dollars
Well worth the price
The crowd is suited up business type, but my wife and I added some trendiness to it and felt and were treated excellent
Gone to the Houstons in Los Angeles for years, been to at least 4-5 and they are all equally good in quality
Consistently good
Not just for ribs steak, but great drinks and salads and daily fresh vegetables
Service is often quite slow however
Can be loud annoying especially if there are a lot of families
Not a very family oriented restaurant
I know it's a chain, but get over it
It's honestly my favorite restaurant
The ambiance is great
food is even better
Do not miss the Chicago Spinach Dip or the loaded baked potato
and their lemonade is made from scratch when you order it!!!
For someone as impatient as me to wait this long it must be good
Truly worth the wait, No matter what you order it is good
Have been eating at various Houstons throughout the years and have yet to have a bad meal
I was frantically searching for a nice restaurant for my bf's 25th bday and I had been raving about houston's spinach dip when I had gone the first time, so we decided to go there since he had never been there
We went early b/c they don't take reservations and we still had to wait about 30 minutes
But it was worth the wait
Recommend the spinach dip and the knife and fork ribs platter
They were absolutely amazing
Our service was unbelieveable too! Our waters were refilled without us ever asking
It was a lot better service since the last time I went! We actually went to the houston's in the Citicorp building not the one on Park Ave
But i'm sure they're all great! Definitely recommend for a date! The Jazz band was great for ambience
They have among the best burgers in the city, and all around incredibly well-prepared, savory food at a very reasonable price
The dimly-lit ambience and cushioned booths make for great comfy date place

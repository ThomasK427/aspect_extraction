Of all the little corner bistros in the Village, this is definitely one we would return to
This restaurant was highly recommended by several Soho/West Village locals, and it looks like one of those simply decorated, understated neighborhood gems that have delicious food in an unpretentious atmosphere
We were greeted by the owner and the waiter who were friendly to the point of obsequiousness, which came off as false rather than charming
We each had a piece of fish that tasted so bad we would never contemplate coming back - at $24 an entree
The waiter was apologetic and brought us a piece of torte - but this also tasted refridgerated and stale
I am at a loss for why this restaurant garners such high praise from my friends - perhaps they reserve their best food for their devoted regulars
The one pro: there was a lively atmosphere at the crowded little bar - different parties were talking to each other and having a good time
Ive been to this local French restaurant many times
The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is warm - lots of locals from SoHo WVillage
Theres outside dining, a couple of tables by the bar and a back room
Food is very good
The calamari is fantastic its sauted, not fried, the mussels are very tasty - lots of flavor
Wasnt impressed with the tuna tartar, but my friend liked it
One thing you MUST try is their fries - the best in the city! It fills up every weekend night
Very cool, laid back place
The owner is always around, making his rounds greeting and charming his guests
Great neighborhood restaurant
Will definitely go back
I accidently mistook this place for Peradou when a friend recommended a name for great French
We had no trouble getting a reservation and the ambiance was very romantic and European
We ordered the clams and salmon appetizer which were very flavorful and fresh, and then had the seared tuna (deliciously rare) and wild bass special (served with an amazing mediterranean rice/olive dish)
The creme brulee was amazing
The waitor was a bit slow, but we weren't in a rush
Overall a great experience!
I have now eaten here twice
The first was a relatively pleasant experience the food was pretty good but the service was SLOW
Last night the dining room was crammed and seemingly only had one waiter which is ludicrous
Needless to say drinks, dinner and the check took what seemed an eternity
and the worst was after waiting all that time my steak was literally charred
It was awful
This place has old SoHo character and characters: from the fanciful maitre d' to the lady-of-a-certain age who sat next to her dog (on it's own stool) at the bar!  Conveniently just around the corner from Film Forum
Especially good bar/appetizer menu (stick with the seafood items)
Nice outdoor space in the warm months
Don't expect crack, New Age service and you'll get the spirit of this place
I also went on Valentine's Day, and it was really a comedy of errors
Lost reservations, out of liquor, jam-packed, waiting room, out of wine, sent steak out raw, no choices for dessert, no room to breathe, terrible service, etc
Instead of using the holiday as a great way to build a customer base, this place went for the quick buck
I'll never be back
I took my wife here for Valentine's Day and I was tremendously disappointed with the entire experience
I checked the place out before I made reservations and it looked nice enough, but when we got there, they packed twice as many tables into the already small dining area
I know many restaurants do this on holidays, but this was out of control
Okay, so we're cramped, but maybe the food would be good
Nope! My steak was good, but the lobster and oyster appetizers were watery with no flavor and my wife's salmon pastry entree was just plain lousy
Our desserts were unbelievably bad
My chocolate banana tart tasted like it had potatoes in it
And of course it's overpriced
So the owner made money that night, but I can't imagine anyone ever coming back
I don't know what's worse, his business acumen or his culinary skills
The Scene  The space is tiny, with a counter against one wall and a row of tables against the other
The ensuing bottlenecks and cramped feeling, sadly, detract from what is otherwise a lovely experience
The decor is casual and festive, but most of the visual interest lies in the open kitchen, which takes up half the room
A maneuver past the grill is required to get to the bathroom
The Food  Density of taste is key here
Every dish reveals several richly layered flavors, each distinct but complementary
Tender grilled meats, a variety of chiles, tart Mexican cheeses, lime, and avocado are all prominent, along with a supporting cast of fruit and nut flavors, tequila marinades, and corn
The daily specials are excellent, as are everyday favorites like the barbacoa burrito, the beef-and-avocado salad, and the queso flameado
For dessert, try the "flan," which is more like a cheesecake
I've been a fan of this spot since it opened a few years ago
However, the chef has recently departed, and the dining experience is definitely heading south
We've tried to remain loyal but eventually stopped ordering the specials and stuck to the regular menu
That worked for a while but last time we went, even the regular menu items has declined, eg: order of pork tacos served in flour torillas instead of corn (as described on the menu)
Much greasier, too much cheese, tortilla chips are no longer fresh/home made, special salsas not worth the extra $$$
If you're in the neighborhood, better to check out Diablo on West 10th, or even Benny's Burritos
Sad to have to say goodbye to the Mama but I doubt we'll return
Definitely not worth the hype
While I liked my chicken mole burrito enough-- it was nothing to write home about
The dried out rice on the side was also quite unappealing
Wow! The salsa was great! You can not get this stuff in a jar! We waited a half hour for a table, against our will, but definitely worth the wait
This place is consistently delicious! While it is sometimes difficult to get a table because of the size, it is definitely worth the wait
Everything on the menu is awesome
If you like fish, try the halibut special
And if you can't get in, go to La Cocina down the street or Agave on 7th Avenue
All of the Californian's don't know squat about Tex-Mex
and don't even get me started on the NY'ers
As a Texas native, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of Mexican food in this city
until I happened upon Mexicana Mama
The food is great, the salsa is awesome, even the guacamole is great (but I still have a problem paying +$8 for a bowl of guac when its only $2 in Tx)
That being said, this is one of the smallest restaurants in town
max 20 seats
So if you don't want to be rushed as many of the reviewers have said, but hasn't happened to me, I recommend going before 8 p
m
to avoid the rush
Then again go after 8 p
m
just means less waiting for me!
It was as if a stop watch started the moment we sat down
So what if the food was decent who can enjoy their meal when the staff tries to take your plate a million times before your even finished? The best part was when our waitress tried to take the chips off our table while my hand was in the bag! Instead of apologizing she asked me if she could pack them to go
I will definitely not be returning the so so mexican fare is not worth enduring the cramped space and the delightful staff
Put simply, I love this place
This may be the food that they serve in heaven
The food and the service have always been outstanding
I am big fan of the specials
And, the staff has always been terrific
Well worth any wait
And, guess what? I am Mexican
Sometimes the great taste of the food makes me weepy for my grandmother
Good thing that they make customers feel at home
I've been here twice before during lunch, and always enjoyed the burritos
I agree with other members, the food is good
However, I have a big problem with being rushed

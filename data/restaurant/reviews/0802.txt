The food is excellent if you're into Filipino food
First timers will surely enjoy themselves there
my American friend can attest to that
He ordered the Beef Caldereta and he enjoyed it
My personal favorite is the Tocino with 2 Eggs
The thing with Krystals is that it's like a diner where you can order from the breakfast menu any time of the day
The place isn't big but quaint
They recently installed a big screen projection where they air shows from the Philippines (ABS-CBN, The Filipino Channel)
Try it
you won't be sorry
I lived in the Philippines for 3 years
On my trip home, to the States, I discovered Krystal's Cafe
Their sign that read, LECHON ON SUNDAYS, anchored me in
Their food is delicious!  Outside of Jersey City, where the most Filipino restaurants and bakeries are hiding, Krystal's is the best that you'll find on the East Coast
Because there's often many customers at dinnertime, it's sometimes hard to get the waitress' attention, but just try hard
The food is well worth it--it's as close to Manila as you can get
Its not fusion cuisine, pure Filipino, which I respect
The ambiance is modest and lovely
Try the shangai rolls, chicken adobo, Mongo, pancit bihon and have a halo-halo or Sago Gulaman for desert
Right in the heart of NYC's Filipino nook, this is the only option for great Pinoy food
I love this place and recommend it highly!
One of the best Korean restaurants outside of Koreatown for authentic dishes at a great value
Ambience and service are significantly better than at its K-town counterparts, though K-town is obviously a better choice if you're new to the cuisine
Nice and compact wine list, and the service couldn't be friendlier
Tip: if you don't automatically get kimchi, just ask your server
I work in the neighborhood, and this is a great, homey place for lunch
I can especially recommend the vegetarian (sweet potato) mandoo
Great value for money
It is a small place, but this way you get a much higher standard of service than the big places in Koreatown
Only one choice if you're a vegetarian - the kimchee fried rice
Good thing it's extremely delicious and addictive (although they could put more vegetables in it)
I've eaten in and had it delivered and the place really hits the spot
The people and ambiance make diners feel right at home
Pretty much everything on the menu is tasty and the portions are more than fair
When eating in, the be bim bop cooked in the stone pot is great
Its also a good option for vegetarians since there is lots of non-meat options
Great place
I had a few gripes with their menu though
The prices on the online menu were not reflective of the actual prices in the store, which were higher
Also, I ordered the Thai wrap, which is not labelled on the menu as spicy, and it was
If you're going to label spicy items on your menu as spicy (like the Buffalo and Cajun wraps), I think you should go ahead and label all the spicy items as spicy
But I'm being a baby
Wraps were great
Really fresh, just delicioius
I didn't think it was such a great deal - 7
50 for a white meat chicken wrap until I actually took it home and looked at it
It's huge
Definitely big enough for 2 people to split
THIS PLACE IS GREAT, THEY KNOW ME BY NAME AND MY ODER AS WELL
THE STAFF BENDS OVER BACKWARDS TO ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS AT NYU
I TELL ALL MY FRIENDS FROM OUT OF TOWN THIS IS YOUR FIRST STOP!
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
You will see lots of NYU students at this crowded Starbucks location
The baristas here are friendly and the service is fast
You may have a hard time finding a place to sit if classes are in session
Note that they do not accept Starbucks cards at this location
This place had crusty rice and the waiter was rude and very unfriendly
He actually came after me because he thought that I didn't leave a good enough tip
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends
Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door
However, once we sat down, they only gave us their regular menu
They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby
After sampling every Indian restaurant on Curry Row, my friends and I have never found one that is better than Taj Mahal
The food is fresh, rich, and savory! The waiters and manager are friendly and chatty, never cold or rude
For $8 including tip and tax, Taj Mahal offers an amazing lunch special including soup, appetizer, pappadum, bread, rice, main dish, dessert, and beverage
All the food included here are always colorful and full of rich flavor
My personal favorite is the Chicken Korma, and I've never had a better one at any other restaurant
Taj Mahal prepares it thick and tangy, complete with heavy cream, yogurt, fennel, mango, raisins, and of course generous chucks of juicy chicken! My mouth is watering as I write this
If you want to try Indian food for the first time this is the obvious choice!
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food
a friend and I went there for dinner one sunday and were pleasantly surprised( as she had embaked on the quest to try all the reastaurants with me
) the waiters work together to serve you quickly without making you feel rushed
the food is spicy by nature
l
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice
our entire experience was nice, adn though we got the $7
95 special, we got unlimited papadam and tea(even free beer) just by asking
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan
if this happens, just ask for real naan
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago
and never strayed
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven
carnivores too, can sample succulent tikka masala and all the tandoori dishes
yummy!
I've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend
We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal
This is where the aforementioned line was
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter
Long story shortened

The food is served in huge super size proportion, and you'll be lucky to finish everything
Best part of it is cost less than $25 per person for a wonderful dinner
I went there a few times this year, and the service fast and consistent
I've been coming here since I was a kid (and that's at least 25 yrs
ago)
Their pastrami and french fries are second to none
A quintessential part of the NYC gastronome
You simply have to make a pilgrimage there now and again
The Mill Basin Deli is one of the BEST Kosher Deli's! Beyond it's amazing food, you are surrounded by an Art Gallery! Every wall is decorated by famous artists
It is an amazing experience! I recommend trying there PLT (Burnt Pastrami, Lettuce adn Tomato)
You will be very happy!
I have never had anything in the Mill Basin Deli that doesn't smack of freshness
The comfort foods, kind employees and hustle and bustle remind me of Sundays at Grandma's with the entire extended family
I leave feeling cared for and content
Don't miss the Noodle Pudding
I grew up in the neighborhood, but I still schlep back for the best kosher deli on the planet
Don't miss the thick-cut french fries and sour pickles to die for
For those who've seen the 150 foot long, 14 foot high billboard on Flatbush Avenue Avenue U, you'll have to settle for a human size one, even if your eyes are bigger
However, you won't be disappointed! The food is outstanding, the service is friendly, and the artwork on display are rare beauties
If you like art, but hate museums, why not have a mouth-watering meal and walk around for a few minutes and enjoy a world-class exhibit at the same time!
I strongly recommend Mill Basin's Best Deli
It's a friendly and fun atmosphere
Joe Mineo is often behind the counter, providing fun, laughs and love to all his customers! I strongly suggest your try the grill cheese sandwich! If Joe's not around ask for Vito, he knows how to slice a mean turkey breast
Not worth the wait, very small and overpriced the service is not that great and the place is way to small
Just remodeled, La Villa has out-grown the pizzaria/restaurant hybrid and is becoming a full-fledged Italian Restaurant
They added tables, and added more wood brass accents
The La Villa house salad is enough for 3 or 4, and every entree is excellent
The waitstaff treats everyone like friends family
friendly service,family run,great big slices and reallow price and catchy old tunes in the juke box in the back
your taste buds will have you coming back again and again and your wallet won't be thinned by an overpriced pizza
and it is nice to see the pie really doesn't fit in the box ,just the way it should be
and John treats everyone like a cherished customer
a great place to pick up a pie for that friday night at home movie or the sunday football game
my name is scott
i grew up within a half mile of this pizza god
i remember the day they first opened
the son of the owner still works their after almost 40 years
i have lived in 3 other major cities and have visited countless others throughout the u
s
there was dino's pizza, ruby's pizza, but closed in the early 60's/ I have baked pizza professionally and at home using time tested traditional method
In addition to the fact that i can be away for 5-10 years, going to lenny's is always like coming home, the food is even better than the days where we go over for a slice after work
it is great to see some of the same people and even the newcomers, though the neighborhood has changed radically, i would bet my life on the ;pizza
i give it the highest rating possible
Lenny John's is definitely a mid-Brooklyn/Flatbush tradition for 2 reasons - the food and the hours
You feel like some chicken parm at 3 am? No problem! LJ's will be open - and as crowded as at 8pm
Their food is top notch with overflowing portions and a wonderful sweet, tangy gravy (sauce)
For cheese lovers try the baked zitti sicilian
I will say that while their entree's are excellent, their pizza is just a little above average
The best home-made pizza all day and night long with lines out the door
The price is right
Everything here is superb! Every time I'm in Brooklyn, Frank's is a MUST! Not only do they have fantastic pizza, they have the best veal parmigan hero anywhere! Everything is top notch and you're well aware that you're in a family establishment
I always have a sitdown meal at Frank's
The bread is toasted and warm Italian bread, and they always offer you more when you polish it off
The waitresses are very friendly and helpful
I love their tortellini carbonara -- the pork is thin sliced and crispy, and the tortellini is thick and tender at the same time
It sends my heart to heaven
I love this place! Here's another place that leaves you with plenty of tasty leftovers
:)  The service is great, and the family environment is comfortable and laid-back, allowing you to enjoy your meal with lots of other non-intrusive, non-pretentious working class family people
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
I ordered a dish, and even though they had run out of half of the ingrediants, they still served it to me -- cold
Lobsters bigger than a small dog, great steaks and a butt-kicking raw bar
I hadn't been back to Lundy's since before 9/11, but I decided that it was time once again to trek to Sheepshead Bay
I was amazed at how much better the place as become
In addition to all of the my favorites from days gone by, the restaurant has a new energy and the daily specials are out of this world
Last week I had Parrot Fish it was amazing, tender and delicious and paired with some great sides
I plan to go back this week and see what new things the chef has created!
I don't find this place to live up to its reputation
The smell near the bar is unbearable, the food is so so, nothing out of the norm, just very plan
I can't imagine what kind of swill people are used to eating that they consider Lundy's great or even passable food
If you consider dirt ambiance - then go for it
If you consider throwing food at your when they remember good service, then go for it
Overall - it should close down
This place is like a really old car
Fun to look at, but it doesn't drive so well on modern roads
The wide open room and high ceilings have been known for creating a noisy environment
OK
we expect that, but the noise should be happy diners, enjoying a good meal, not angry staff slamming dishes
The staff lack grace; the food is adequate
tho not what it used to be (some 40 or 50 years ago), Lundy's is still quite an experience
Great seafood and amusing cocktails, but the atmosphere really does it for me
Really old-school, a spacious dining room (even tho this newer version uses only a fraction of the original restaurant's space), with old-timey indirect lighting, it feels like a scene out of 'Radio Days'
Certainly worth the trip to Sheepshead Bay, an oft-overlooked neighborhood
Update: Attended a birthday dinner here, a great time was had by all
Then, somebody from Lundy's called us a couple days later to thank us for coming! Weird, huh? But very cool!
The waiters were attractive and friendly
Oysters were small but decent
Lobster bisque substituted chunks of lobster for undissolved clumps of flour bathed in pink goo
Possibly canned
Lobster stuffed with scallops and shrimps was tasty but undistinguished
Wine was delicious
The location is so-so: across a busy street from the marina at Sheepshead Bay
The restaurant itself, while large, could as easily have been a TGI Friday's with especially large windows
Nothing special
Expensive for the quality of food
Lundy Brothers is fantastic! A lobster Fra Diablo cooked to perfection over a huge portion of Linguini with clams and mussles
What can I say
Make more room for the desert
There are so many incredable items to chose It's hard to decide

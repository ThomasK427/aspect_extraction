the rest of my table disliked their food, and also had to send drinks back because it was not what they ordered
in the end, it was way too expensive, the service was awful, and the wait staff cares much more about how they look in their uniform than serving their tables
Any chance I get I make my way down to Cafeteria on 17th and 7th
This place is an all around good time for a 1st date down the line to a full out B-day bash
The food is simple yet delicious, the drinks are perfectly mixed, the decor is trendy yet comfortable and the price is RIGHT!
unlike other dining facilities, this one is a specialty place
the atmosphere after midnight whereby you can go there after a date or eith a date, or before going to bed after a long night
food is average
Good food cool atmosphere hip people
If you live in the hood you probably have already been there
I used to frequent this place when I lived in the area and it was always the perfect spot for a 4am post-bar omelette or a casual lunch
Even since I've moved uptown I keep going back for the wonderful tomato soup- and the desserts are yummy too! I wouldn't go here for a special night on the town, but it's a surefire staple for anyone in the neighborhood
As for the complaints about the 'tude, there have been times when they've been great and times when they've been a little off, but it kinda comes with the territory- super-busy place in a popular neighborhood- if you expect to be treated like royalty everywhere you go in this city you're probably going to be pretty disgruntled most of the time
Have never bothered to write a review for a restaurant but my terrrible experience there prompted me to do so
Was there on a Tuesday night and the host was EXTREMELY rude
We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and after 45 minutes, several parties (of two as well) were seated before us after arriving after us
Am not one to throw tantrums, but when we decided to leave and told the host to please take us off the list as other people had been seated before us he offered no apology
Went a block up to Viceroy where we were had a superb staff wait on us
Despite the good food at Cafeteria, am never going back and will be sure to spread the word to as many people as I know
Whatever happened to the principle of good service to clients?
This is the true original; the most popular spot after the clubs are closed and the BESTEST mac and cheese that you can get at 4 AM in this city
Although there is a wait more often than not, it is always worth it
From bread pudding to burgers to waffles and fried chicken, Cafeteria knows how to get it right every time
Beautiful waitstaff that is always moving and very accomodating, this place is a great choice for every occation
Do not be fooled by imitators
The food is okay
I find it rude when restaurants automatically add 18% gratuity and an additional service charge of $8
25 on top of your bill
I didn't understand the service charge at all
The tables are tightly packed in
You might as well be dining with the party next to you because they are only two feet away
The decor is nice and you can eat there late
Place to see and be seen
One can easily assume this place will be packed around 1-5AM on a weekend night and it looks almost like a club the way its trendily decorated (low light candles, post-modern IKEA like furniture)
However, its a trendy alternative to any deli / Denny's anyone has around here
The variety is good -- from an assortment of salads, brunch, and entrees that are reasonably priced
Expect the service to be a bit snobby, as lines form and when they start seating people
I went there for brunch and the food was just delicious
I was with 3 friends and everything we had was really good
Try the pesto and goat cheese omelet, it's amazing! Can't wait for next brunch, I just want to go back
We went sans reservations for dinner on a Monday night with three people
Got seated indoors after a 20 minute wait (outdoor area was booked)
Service was unremarkable - they just did their jobs
Menu was, well, cafeteria food
We all had the turkey burger - it was alright - with mac n' cheese - nothing great
But we weren't expecting much, so we weren't disappointed
And the pricetag was comfortable
Decor was clean, bright, and hip
Ambience was young, good-looking, and fun - a little loud, but we were able to have a conversation without having to yell
We left feeling satisfied with our cafeteria experience
I plan on returning whenever I need a quick pick for lunch or dinner
This is a good place to catch up with old friends, siblings, husbands, or wives, or longstanding lovers
This is not a date spot
i liked it
went w/o a reservation, seated pretty promptly on a friday, great cocktails, great menu
can't wait to try it late night!
My boyfriend and I had an overall nice experience at this place
The food is very good and not too overpriced
It's got a very sex and the city, chic type feeling
The staff was not overly friendly - the manager was extremely rude
The service was great though
The food was out quickly, the busboys did a great job and the server was alright - he did his job
I'd check this place out!!! Don't order the ginger ale though - it was disgusting and flat! The wait was about 20 minutes and no longer
My husband and I ate here in June 2005
We had no problem with the service unlike the other reviewers
The food was great and the prices reasonable
I had the grilled chicken sandwich and my husband had the meatloaf
Plain and simple, me and some of my friends (all mid 20's and succussful models) came for dinner and wine
The female server was such a rude, disrespectful person that was talking about us to all of the staff
The staff was all looking at us unpleasantly
I have eaten at all the top, hip, 'sceney' restaurants in the city and this just is a pretender restaurant with angry, bitter, pretender staff
Come on, Cafeteria, ATTITUDE, LONG WAITS, SNOBBERY, AND MISERABLENESS IS SO OVER
GROW UP
This restaurant is really fantastic, serving the most wonderful upscale comfort food, and at a reasonable price! It is especially fabulous in warm weather when you can eat al fresco
The drinks are amazing, and it's open 24hr a day
What more can you ask for?
The Cafeteria is one of the hippest places in the city, no matter what time of day! The ultra gracious staff and prompt food service makes this the perfect place to hit in the city
If you've ever had an urge for chicken and waffles after the club scene or maybe just hankered for some macaroni and cheese (theirs is fabulous!), you need to see the Cafeteria
There's also the off chance you might get a celebrity sighting or two! Good food, and service make this the ideal late night stop
definitely have a go at the Mojito's too!
At weekends the queuing gets crazy after about 10 so get there sooner
Relaxed atmosphere with decent if unspectacular food, cheerful friendly service
My 2
5yr old even got crayons from the waiter!
Ok well, I must say that this place is fabulous for all!!! While the menu is kind of diner-esh, it was still some of the best food that I have ever had and the service is spetacular!!! The staff was very friendly and treated me well and I was not all dressed up eitherI will be visiting the cafeteria again
We arrived to find a fairly full restaurant and a wait of around 30 minutes
The guy at the door had some serious attitude
When seated (the middle of Winter and right by the window with a draft coming through), we were brought some stale bread which was largely inedidble
The wait for the meal wasn't too long and the waitress wasn't too obnoxious, if only a little ditzy
The food is the only good thing this place has going for it
The servings were adequate and I honestly enjoyed my meal
But good food does not a good restaurant make
The decor is nothing to rave about, the atmosphere is rowdy and the service is pretty much non-existent
Much better eats to be found in NYC
If you are looking for a decent place to grab a bite to eat after clubbing, this is definitely the it spot to go to
The hearty food is surprisingly good
The wait staff attentive
And the ambiance is wonderful
If you are looking for exceptional culinary experience, go somewhere else
It's all about what hot and chic in this eatery

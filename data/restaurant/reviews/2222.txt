a great time was had by all
the waitstaff was very friendly and the food and drinks were terrific
go on an empty stomach, the portion sizes are substantial
this is the best mexican food i've had since moving to nyc 2 years ago from texas
an extensive menu for vegetarians
if you are going to have a large group, i would recommend calling ahead
it's a small place and i'm sure the staff would appreciate a heads up
I've been going to Mi Nidito for years, since it's in my 'work' neighborhood
They have great lunch deals
and the servers have always been friendly and efficient
I love the homemade salsa
There's a nice variety of vegetarian entrees as well, (I love the vegetable chimichanga)
It's not gourmet, it's good, so I give them a solid 7
The atmosphere is okay
not romantic or anything
but fun for groups
The portions are generous and I always leave with a smile on my face
Mexican is my very favorite cuisine, and I've been on a mission to find an authentic restaurant here in NYC
I really liked the chips and salsa and Mi Nidito, and my entree (Cancun Chicken) was a delight as well! The margaritas also have a very wonderful consistency and texture and taste
Overall, a great experience, although it was a bit pricey
I read all the reviews about fresh ingredients and I must say - it is noteworthy indeed! My only gripe was that I left feeling fuller than EVER (and I only ate half my entree), so beware!
Went here before a show in the area
Maybe I was expecting more because of the prices or because it seemed to stray from Tex-Mex style
I had the mole and it was bland
The chips and salsa were good though
I've eaten here many times, and we've never been disappointed
The veggie options are very good, the margaritas are flavorful and abundant, and the service is great
A very good value, and it's easy to get there! Good gathering place for post-game or birthdays
I am not an employee or owner of this classic Mexican place, I am only a loyal fan of the best authentic Mexican restaurant in my neighborhood
It is a small place that serves great magaritas and I have never had a bad meal in here, so I don't know what they mean by mediocre, unless they consider Taco Bell authentic! (the review before mine) This is a great place and anybody who calls it anything less needs to go somewhere that is more flash and doesn't let their food and drinks do the talking! Mi Nidito can rest on it's laurels
why aren't they in the top ten in NYC??????
Forget MaryAnn's


Mi Nidito has excellent and authentic mexican food with great (and strong) margaritas
Great little family owned restaurant
big screen tv and great food using fresh, natural ingredients, no additives
great bar specials
Xlarge menu
lots of variety
margaritas of all flavors small to grande
The ambience, margaritas, and food are amazing here
The portions are enormous (food and drink)! It's a great place to bring a date or a few friends
Our waitress brought us the wrong order, but quickly corrected the error, and the food was worth a few extra minutes
Putting aside the relatively small space, the food is amazingly good and the margaritas blow you away
After trying a bunch of Mexican places, I'd definitely recommend this place
I couldn't be happier this neighborhood Mexican is in my neighborhood
You may pay a bit more than other places around but the quality is so far and away superior, it would be worth much more
The place isn't much to look at, but homey and the staff is attentive
The best part-- if you want it spicey, they will actually make it spicey
Take out or eat in, you will not find fresher ingredients at any other Mexican in town!
Good food from traditional Mexican, healthy Mexican, to pub food like wings
Fun place to meet after work
Friendly staff
The Scene In the same location for over 50 years and boasting a big red awning and neon sign, it's hard to miss
Step down into this charmingly quirky bistro, where brick- and fake wood-paneled walls are jammed with signed headshots of Broadway actors past and present, interspersed with old French lithograph posters
Older couples, French businessmen and Broadway-bound theatergoers squeeze together on the red banquettes
The Food  French-bistro classics rule the menu here
Start with a sprightly pile of well-dressed greens topped with pink, succulent slices of lightly smoked duck, or a creamy, tart, caper-studded celeri remoulade served in a fat, hamburger-sized mound
Follow it with a winey, rosemary-scented boeuf bourguignon--just right on a chilly night
Skip the chewy, dried-out duck a l'orange or the boat of rather flabby--although gratis--frites
For dessert, the warm tarte tatin is a good choice
This place is a true Midtown gem - authentically French, cramped full of indulging diners, amazing food, unbelievable portions and insanely reasonable prices
get the mussels as an appetizer and try to save room for dessert
Tout va bien, indeed!
My friend and I went to this cozy bistro after the theater
We were early (5pm) so we were the first there
The escargot was deliciously garlickly
The steak poive was perfect
The ENORMOUS crepe tvb was almost too much for two
The value was excellent
The total with one glass of wine, two appetizers, a large bottle of water, and the desert was about $110 with tip
We were not rushed at all
We loved the food and the price was very affordable as we opted for the prix fixe menu
More importantly, the service was attentive and very warm
The wait staff had good recommendations and when i broke a wine glass, they reacted in a way to put me out of my embarrassment quickly and even filled me a new glass of wine
Finally, as a sweet ending to the night, the server offered us a free glass of dessert wine on the house
How nice!
This is a great restaurant to hit up before you head to the theater
The food is great and the ambiance is very french
The value was great too as my girlfriend and I had the Prixe Fixe menu
She ordered the mussels and I think they must have brough 5 pounds of them
They had to bring a second garbage bowl for her shells
The fries are great too
If you are in the mood for fabulous non-fussy french food this is the place to go
From Appetizer to Dessert, you can't really go wrong with this place and if you can coax your server to make up a batch of their sangria, you won't regret it
The boisterous and crowded atmosphere (especially pre-theatre) does not make it ideal for dates, but it is a great place for large groups of friends
I was wary at first - especially since the ambience is a bit eclectic but the food was phenominal! Perfectly done and beautiful presentation!! I enjoyed every moment and was pleasantly surprised! I now highly reccomend it!
good, authentic French food
the decor could use some improvment but the staff is very friendly and it is very good French food at reasonable prices
This was the most overpriced place I have ever seen
From the tacky neon outside to the $20 plate of luncheon meat this place was 100% riduculous
The sticker shock from the initial menu look was the worst part
A $22 sandwich, $6 for a cup of soup (that was just alright) - enough said
Don't waste your time
We went and really enjoyed the food and wait service (the ambience is fairly non-existent)
The pasta prices are from $12-$18, generally, and I ordered a porcini mushroom pasta special
which was $26!! When the manager came over to discuss this drastic difference in price, he told me I was the only one who complained about the price, and that porcini mushrooms are expensive, don't I know that?? Instead of customer service, we got defensive surliness
If you go, ASK THE PRICE OF THE SPECIALS!
A nice place to get some neighborhood italian and very decent service in Hell's Kitchen

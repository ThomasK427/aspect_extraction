And complaining about it is lunacy
With clearly very little knowledge or appreciation for fine foods, Laureljanssen deserved a horrible experience
How disappointing to make my pilgrimage from the City to Brooklyn, order such an average burger that comes with onions even when order specifically WITHOUT, and is served by the rudest, most incompetent moron I've yet experienced in my years of rude NYC service
For $100 lunch, I should have stayed in Manhattan and gone to Smith Wolensky, where the crotchety waiters are nice to me and my burger doesn't come with a side of $6
00 lettuce/tomato -- a bit excessive, don't you think?????
Peter Luger's is a wonderfully unique experience and has the best porterhouse in NYC, period
While the waits frequently run to over an hour, even with a reservation, the food is definitely worth it
Fit in and order off menu - my faves are the porterhouse, the sinfully thick and juicy bacon, and the best pecan pie I've ever had
Tomatoes and onions are thick and popular, the cheesecakes wonderful
The service is distinctly old school New York and charming
Ambience is a bit coarse - don't pop the question here - and location suck but hey, you know why you're here - it's the food, schmuck!
Rating food is obviously a subjective exercise
However, when it comes to Luger's steak there is no question - it is simply the best steak available anywhere, bar none
They have over a century of experience hand-selecting the best meat in the US, and it shows time and time again
For atmosphere, fancy napkins, a trophy wine list, a fish special - go to other places
If you want the best steak of your life, go to Lugers
-Quick tip: try the $8 burger, made from the trimmings of the aged porthouse
Excellent!
peter lugers is a place everyone should at least try once
while our steaks, medium-rare, was good, it's not as good as everyone rated it
the no fuss waiters and decor were actually a nice break from the pretentious restaurants in the city, but overall it was just a decent dining experience
definatley does not live up to the hype
rarely does a place live up to its reputation
in the case of Peter Luger, it exceeeded its reputation
my party of 10 had a terrific meal
steak was delicious, service was excellent
can not wait to go back again and again
I've been to tons of steakhouses
The others don't even compare
Anyone who disagrees is out of their mind
You don't go for ambience
you don't go for cushy service
you go for Red Meat
No fooling around at Luger's
They serve up the best steak anywhere
Anyone who has taste that disagrees should be getting their meat at McDonald's
'NUFF SAID
Best steak in the country barring none
worth a trip to NYC from LA
Have been going there for 35 years
meal is always consistent
Never varies
I was definitely impressed after finally eating here
Bacon is a must
The steak is very good, I would rate it among the best I've had, but in my opinion Keen's porterhouse is a bit better
I won't say Peter Luger is the best steak I've ever had, but it is certainly up there
How anyone can give the food anything less than an 8 (unless they don't like steak with pink on the inside) completely boggles my mind
The party of 8 I dined with were all agog at how good the seak was
The servers were all helpful and good-natured, although we ate upstairs and had a lot of the younger staff, so that might have been it
Decor is old, but the bathrooms are clean and updated
If you're in NYC, you do have to take a trip out to W'burg once to try it
I've had a lot of steak in this city, and Luger is one you have to try
Hands down best steak on this planet
I have been to every steak place in NY, LA, Chicago, Miami, Vegas, Dallas and they all try but simply cannot compete
Best bacon, lambchops, porterhouse, side dishes, bartenders, maitre d's and waiters
The uneducated people saying anything bad about Peter Luger either a) couldnt get a reservation b) generally enjoy the meat on the buffet at Ponderosa or c) order their meat well done
I have personally brought over 30 Luger Virgins here and each time it is hands down the best they have ever had
Those complaining about prices obviously dont eat at Palm, Sparks, Mortons, Strip House, Del Frisco's which are all more expensive across the board
Long live the King of Beef
Ive had better steak at Bonanza
Good thing we had $200 of wine to ease the pain
I understand steak places can be hit or miss but all four of us at the table agreed that this place is surviving on its prior reputations
Service was good, the waiter was a little flip, but we can deal with that
The wine selection was good, but a little on the pricier side
This place not only provides great service, and awesome steaks, but it also provides the BEST appetizers ever
I've been to 5 out of the 10 listed here and several others not listed (Palm Westside; Gallagers; Del Friscos to name a few)
There is NO way the caliber of Steak at Peter Lugers is that good
The steak tasted like a burnt grill; the steak sauce was WAY to sweet; the desert was OK; the wine selection was terrible
WHO is voting this place as #1???   Fughedaboutit
Those that talk of Grey, tough steak are obviosly ordering the steak too well to begin with
A real red meat lover orders it so; BLOOD RED
If you order correctly and eat like a human, it's still red, perfect, tender and juicy prime porterhouse
It is always hot, always served by a man who has served steak his whole life, and always the best steak you could ever eat
If you think it's overpriced, try the filets at Palm or Sparks, which are not quite as tender as the porterhouse at lugers, and cost twice as much
Best steak I've had
It's actually better to have the rare than the medium rare
The steak is aged very well and full of flavor that the steak sauce is not even needed
They don't try to saturate their steak with butter like others
It's just a great steak
Very low key kind of place that serves good food
I was there for the steak not the decor
If you want decor, go to other trendy places and over pay for bad food
If it was not for the flowing beer that evening the dinner would have received an overall of 1
The HIGH ($285 for 4 people) price of Going to one of these Heard it's great hole in the walls
The steak was tough and dry by the time I reached the middle
When I looked for a correction on the meal I was looked at as Elliot Ness in the middle of Al Capone's bedroom
Originaly from New York I was looking at surprising my guests with a legendary steak, in a legendary city
boy was I wrong
about the steak that is
I absolutely agree about the 'lava hot' platters making the meat after the first slice a very expensive disappointment
The best single piece of meat I ever had was at the old Manny Wolf's---so good, when you think about it, that I can i
d
it as the best single steak in my life
Much like the single best wine
but how tough is it to say that about meat? Morton's was a 9-10 compared to Lugar's
and Sparks was almost that good
The service was almost outright rude at Lugar's as well
all in all a less than swell evening
This is by far the most overrated restaurant in the city
Is the meat good? Yeah, but I have had better and it is certainly not worth the miserably crowded, ugly little room, crappy sides and surly service

Excellent food with a home made touch
Try the Kibbe balls (home made by the owner's mom) a delicious ground beef mixed withg cracked wheat formed into a ball and stuffed with sauted ground beef, onion, all spice cinamon and pine nuts
It is heavenly specially when eaton hot
Families with kids I recommend early diner
good food, good service friendly atmosphere
you ger great value for a good meal
My girlfriend and I love coming here
The food is delicious authentic Mexican and the margaritas are fantastic! Don't take it from me, the place is always packed - that's always a good sign
The service is friendly if a little slow sometimes and when it's crowded the wait is a little long
They definetely could use a larger place to accomodate more customers, but it's worth it
As soon as I tasted the beans, noticed immediately that they had a burn taste to them
I then got a hold of our waiter and told him that the beans had been overcooked
He then proceeded to the kitchen to bring me what I thought was a fresh batch of refried beans
He brought it out as a side order plate within a few minutes
I immediately dove into the beans with my corn tortillas and dejavu
The beans tasted exactly the same as the ones I had previously told him that had been overcooked/burned
I then ask to talk to the manager in charge, which was in the restaurant at the time
The manager refused to talk to me sending the waiter to tell me to tell me that he was not available, when I had previously seen him doing absolutely nothing at the bar
In Short Burnished brass and stained wood complement roughly mortared brick and the occasional plant
Amid ubiquitous earth tones, corporate types and small parties (celebrating or simply living large) occupy deep booths done up in fine upholstery and lit from above by pin spotlights
Burgers, prime rib and steaks are the specialties of the house, but the menu also includes salmon, salads, pork chops and roasted chicken
i got to this place often and as far as im concerned its the best place to eat around the area the food and service is excellent
the good part about this place is you dont have to make reservations its
you can just come in anytime before 10pm on sundays and 11pm the rest of the night(just to let some ppl know) and get a table the service is one of the best
the staff has great team work
i recommend this restaunt for people who dont like makin reservation and want to have an enjoyable dining experience
I called to arrange a business dinner for 4 clients coming in from out of town and this restaurant was very unaccomodating
I understand they do not accept reservations, but when I asked if our clients could call in their name when they were on their way, the manager said no
He also informed me that the wait could be over an hour
In fact, he recommended Morton's which is located next door
That says a lot if management is recommending another restaurant
This is a great restaurant
However, do not show up at 10:01 pm or the hostess will not seat you
I regularly eat at this restaurant and showed up with some out of town guests we had just picked up at the airport calling ahead (15 min earlier) to make sure we could still get seated
However as the hostess confirmed, it was 1 minute after ten and she would not seat us
Very disappointing
Great looking food, drink, and staff
This is a great place to enjoy a cosmo with great friends
The vegetable plate is divine and all of the staff (including management personnel) have a great image
I have tried many bakeries in my years, but none compare to the service and taste of BW's
I have been getting cakes and other goodies for at least 20 years and wouldn't have it any other way
When I first came here, I saw people ordering 5-6 at a time
Now I know why! Food is fresh, well prepared cooked to order! Kids love the place!The building is a great little piece of history, too! Would like to see it cleaned up restored a bit
With just a few stools, it can crowded
Best burger in NJ!
Great ambiance great little burgers made from fresh beef on potato buns
AWSOME
Colombian food was new to me and I was very curious to try it
The lady was very helpful in helping us decide and describing the meals
I was not at all disspointed in my selections!  The food was amazing
It's a family atmoshpere, but quiet
The people are friendly and non-bothersome (like checking up on you every five minutes!)   Before you order your bebidas (drinks), check the list of what's available! There are the usual America sodas, and Spanish sodas too!!
I had my birthday dinner there and I couldn't of picked a better spot! The place was small but cozy and friendly
The perfect setting for the small and quiet dinner I had in mind
The food was great! The waiter was very friendly and helpful in explaining the plates to my family
Liked it very much! Went on a Tuesday so it was quiet--don't know how the weekends are
As an appetizer I ordered the crab cakes
Wow! While most crab cakes are mostly breading with shredded crabmeat these two were made of large lumps of crab with little breading and cooked perfectly
For my main course I had the seared tuna
When the owner, George, came by the table to ask how our meal was, always a classy move, he told me that the tuna was high sushi grade quality
Not only was the fish delicious, the portion was huge
My wife is not much of a seafood eater and so she had the chicken parm which she loved
Sea Shack is the place to go if you care about quality AND quantity
If you like heavy or overbearing sauces, you won't find them here
This restaurant lets the quality of the fish stand on its own and matches it with sauces that compliment the fish's fresh flavor
the food was good, but not really worth the price that was charged
it is a small dining room, and you are right next to the other tables
would i go back? maybe
If you don't care about atomosphere, but you do care about foods, you MSUT visit WONDEE'S!! Price is very very cheap BUT TASTEs are 4 stars! Wondee's is very local and family stule restaurant
I have been sty many Thai restaurants but Wondee's are BEST with such a cheap price and big portion
TRY IT!
UNDOUBTEDLY! We look for excuses to rent a car because this is the best pizza in all the five boroughs, and its in Jersey! The appetizers are tasty, garlic bread is a huge pie - with tons of fresh basil, garlic chunks and butter, stuffed eggplant - mmm
But lets not waste any time here, the real winner here is the eggplant pizza
People who dont even like that nightshade, lose their mind when they try this masterpiece
Fresh Locatelli mozzarella, basil, garlic, breaded eggplant on top - this is a food orgasm if there ever was one
And dont miss the groovy placemats, THANKS FOR THE BEST PIE EVER Steven Ron and John!!!!!
Just got back from Brooklyn's Pizzeria with the next two generations of my family who, unfortunately, live in Maryland
They consider themselves stranded on pizza's desert island down there
Well, they went crazy for the tomato and cheese pie at Brooklyn's in Hackensack
As a Brooklyn native, I know pizza, and the product here is great
The ingredients are amazingly fresh, the pizza is served promptly, and the aromas waft through the whole place
It's a winner!
101 Pub provides pleasant and prompt service
Their menu has something for everyone and every item is as delicious as the others
It will tend to get busy during dinner hours but the wait is not usually too long and is worth every bite
Children are welcome in the dining area
You will want to come here if you are looking for a delicious meal, good time, and don't mind that the sound level is a bit higher than an average restaurant but lower than the local bar
Try the Steaks!!!!!! Enjoy :)
When I came back to NYC three years ago, I found this place
They have every kind of food imaginable, and they can cook all of them fantastically!! Bendix is known for Thai-American Chow, but pancakes, grilled cheeses, and Italian food are all great choices too! Like their shirts say, Get fat!
This is a neat restaurant on the busy 17 south
Family friendly , good reception and customer service
As this was our first time in a Hibachi style restaurant, it was fun gathering around the table
Not really a fast paced restaurant but with a relaxed atmosphere
The onion volcano and the chef hat tricks made it even more fun to watch and see them cook
Will take more friends next time
This old-style chophouse is oozing class at every turn
Patrons frequently enjoy succulent chops, mouth watering sides and the famous onion block which could feed an army of classy carnivoures
Sit and toke on an Upman New Yorker or whatever your preference may be while the fantastic chef prepares your meat to your liking
Enjoy the ambiance of a joint that is trult the epitomy of class

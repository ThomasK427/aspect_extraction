Went here last night to celebrate a friend's birthday
The cocktails are VERY sweet but we all enjoyed them (all girls) and the food was great
The waiter was helpful in helping us select different dishes for the table and the banana/chocolate dessert was amazing
The bathrooms are really THAT cool
Behind a one way mirror, you really can see the entire restaurant from inside the bathroom! Very very weird
The ONLY negative was when we asked the waiter to secretly bring birthday cake and some other desserts for the table
When two desserts came without the cake, he announced to the table The one with the candle is coming
Obviously ruined the surprise! He didn't even seem to understand
However, would go back for sure
I went here last weekend and was pleasantly surprised
The food was fresh and beautifully presented
The staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable
A good value for the money :) The bathrooms made a good converstion piece at dinner
It was just too noisy
My group had to yell over each other to be heard
that part wasn't fun
The appetizers were really good and a great price, but overall, I just wasn't that impressed
The bathrooms are cool, but you have to wait in line hovering over other diners, and then there is no light once inside
the bathrooms are also coed, so while searching for the toilet I almost fell in
Worth going once to check it out
my experience at Peep this week was so bad that it was noteworthy: 2 friends and I walked in 11pm and ordered a round of Triple-Berry Cosmos - the drinks were poured in different glassware because the requesite glass was unavailble - no problem - but apparently perceiving our initial issue with this - the blond-bobbed bartendress proceeded to sloppily pour our drinks drenching our glassware, then saw that one glass was cracked and the drinks - although a week ago were delicious - missed something this time and tasted like medicine
We went back to her to return the drinks and she, after ignoring us for a while - slapped down our money - keeping her tip
alright then! We we're shocked, to say the least -- and left and went to Bar Britti and cocktailed to the live band in the back lounge
had a blast
Food was delish -- I had the Rama dish, wish was awesome, and some sort of fried banana dessert with chocolate that was out of this world!!  Fun surprise in the bathroom makes for a really fun experience, but I wouldn't advise bringing a kid -- might be a little traumatic for the tike!
Arrived around 9:30pm and had to wait a half hour for the table
SO worth the wait
Some of the best Thai food I've EVER had
The calamari is AMAZING!!
I liked the look of the place as soon as I walked in but was disappointed with their drinks
The food was decent with some variety
The highlight and most memorable element would be the one way mirrored bathrooms where you can look at your friends eating without you but you can't see the sink because its so dark in there!
Eclectic menu choices, but the food was just above average
The Asian infused desserts were the best part of the meal
And I don't know why so many reviews said the waiters were horrible
they were very attentive
Called earlier to make reservations for a group of 4
The guy who answered the phone gave me the run around and told me that I can't make reservations here, when the reviews clearly stated to make reservations
He became rude and we hung up
My friends and I decided to try going down to check it out anyway
When we got there it was packed but the girl told us that the wait would be 45min-1hr
We took our places at the bar and waited
1hr and a half went by and we checked twice, 1 hr 45min went by and we checked again and this time the girl said, Oh the 1 hr wait was for ppl with reservations, you will have to wait longer
We got so fed up and left and went to Penang nearby
We walked by on a Sunday night on our way to another Thai restaurant in the Village and decided to give Peep a try
The food is yummy, drinks tasty, and service attentive
The bathroom, however, freaked me out a little
I found a new favourite Thai restaurant!
we came here on wed
night around 8pm
the place was packed and we didn't have a reservation, but were seated in just a few minutes
the place is long and narrow, making for a tight squeeze past the after-work drinkers at the bar and between the tables in the dining area
i love the lighting, and glass and pink neon in the front
the food was excellent, large portions, and a great price for a trendy soho restaurant
we didn't order drinks, but i did notice that drinks cost as much or more as an entree - don't know what that's all about, since our chicken and pork chops were only $10-$12
we didn't experience horrible service as others have, but i must say that the waiters were not very attentive, and seemed to be running around all over the place
i would still recommend and come back!
Once you go to the bathroom you will immediately understand where they got the name Peep
If the worst quality about a restaurant is it's bathroom, then I will take it cause everything else was awesome
The food was fantastic
Sumptuous curry that doesn't set your mouth or wallet on fire
This is a very cool place, from the pink neon, to the mirrored ceilings and floors, to the infamous bathrooms
And the food is really good, too
However
Drinks are rather over-priced for a mid-ranged restaurant (averaging 9/10 bucks) and the service was terrible
We waited an unreasonable amount of time just to get menus, we had to hunt down our waiter to order a second round of drinks, and getting the check took so long, that when I saw I had been over-charged 2 dollars on one of the cocktails, I paid the extra money, rather than complain and wait even longer for a corrected check
And this was in the early evening when the restaurant wasn't even to full capacity
Still, it's worth a visit
I went on Saturday night and what a nightmare! We waited over an hour for a table for 4 people and NEVER got seated!! The hostess was a disaster-case and the manager was rude, obnoxious and non-apologetic
There is one bartender for a packed bar and restaurant, needless to say, impossible to get a drink
So, our entire party left and spent hundreds of dollars elsewhere
When there are 7 other places to go on the same block, you would think they would try a little harder
The swirling yellow light and fire-house style entrance leaves subtlety out
And the novelty of the barstools made out of giant straws, the rolling mirrored ceiling and the bathroom with a view only goes so far
If the food wasn't delicious and ample, this trendy haunt would certainly fall on its face
I had a rich Masaman curry dish that wouldn't take no more for and answer and my bride stung her tongue on full-flavored chicken Lemongrass Chili over vermicelli noodles
Yummy cocktails and people watching round out the experience
The place did fill up by the time we were leaving, so if you call and they say you don't need reservations, make them anyway
Strange name for a restaurant I wondered
Must mean something in an Asian language
So I asked the waitress
Have you been to the rest room she asked? So I went
The restrooms have mirrored doors right in the dining area
When you enter and turn around to lock the door you realize that the mirrors are actually one-way and you can look out into the dining room while you use the facilities or peep out into the dining room
Strange to say the least
But the food is really good
I cannot review the food because I did not get to eat any
Reservations made for 8:30 for a party of 7 and by 9:45, they still continued to lie about when we may be seated
Everyone around us were frustrated and mad at how they overbooked the evening
The least they can do is be honest about it!! We LEFT after waiting over an hour and a half! I don't care how good the food may be, it is NOT worth your time! -ARGH!-
I visited with my beautiful date on a Monday evening
The place was busy, yet not frenetic
Wait staff was attentive, the bartender gave a stellar effort considering she was alone and the food was better than expected
Drinks arrived promptly
The bathrooms are a tad unique if not a bit unsettling--the movie was good though
The mirrored pinkish ambience served as a workable backdrop for the food and the overall experience
When I ordered a cocktail, it was a bit too sweet
Hey, that happens right? But when my appetizer, my Phad Thai, my Thai Curry, and even the special of the day Tuna came out tasting like candy
I knew it was time to go visit my Dentist
I've been to alot of other Thai restaurants around the city, and this one definitely added one too many spoonfull of sugar to their dishes

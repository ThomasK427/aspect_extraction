The food was good, but obviously not worth the hefty price tag
Butfactor in the incredible environment--you are paying for that, too
Ouch, that bill
Based upon some of these reviews we were somewhat concerned about our first trip to Ono
What we experienced was a pleasant surprise
The food was well prepared and presented if not overly creative
Wait staff were helpful and responsive and at not time did we feel rushed
Could have turned the music down a little as it made conversation between two people at a small table difficult
This was our second attempt and last
No reason to write a review except the inability to comprehend how awful our two meals have been
the first was dinner opening week some time ago - not a good piece of sushi to be had, the robata was so so and nothing was remotely memorable
Today attempted restaurant week - awful
Happy to spend any amount for delectable food - not any amount for this
nONO
went to ono before partying at meatpacking
what a HUGE mistake!! not only were we waiting for half an hour with reservations, once we got seated we waited another 15+ minutes for the waiter to come and take out drink menu
after ordering some sushi
which were mediocre, sat around waiting for someone to come around to check on us
couldnt even leave because no one came around for us to ask for the check
How this place has a 8
9 rating with all these HORRIBLE reviews is beyond me
STAY AWAY
THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER SUSHI PLACES TO WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!
Two words when considering this restaurant (particularly for a group): Don't go
Unless you want poor service at high prices
If you're looking for a nice dining experience with service that matches the bill, look elsewhere
We ordered at 9:30 and some appetizers came at 10:15 while others came at 11:15
Entrees came close to 12am
They say it's because there are 4 kitchens in the restaurant and you should have a tasting menu if you want everything timed correctly
If other upscale restaurants can figure this timing thing out, why can't Ono? They also said they would make it up to us by cleaning off our table between courses
This is after we asked them 3 or 4 times to clear our dirty plates
The food was decent, and service certainly didn't come with a smile -- either from the waitress or our party after this horrible dining experience
I went there with a group of 7 friends from college with a reservation
We were seated an hour and a half after our reservation and finally got appetizers an hour after that
The food was terrible and came out at these odd times where the rest of the table had their entrees before I had seen my appitizers
Not to mention that the scene wasn't even that interesting
After we racked up a bill of around 1500 with drinks, they were quick to shoo us out
Overall it was a terrible experiece clouded with bad service, bad food, and unreasonable prices
Despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty on a Wednesday night, the hostess berated my friend for arriving 20 min
late
I agree with the previous review with respect to service - lots of waiters around, but yours is always MIA
The lighting adds to it - it's so dim that it's hard to see what you're eating
The menu is vast but is difficult to decipher, and the restaurant is so loud it's difficult to hear your own conversation
Our spicy tuna sushi was so spicy that even our cajun lover friends couldn't handle it
Only thing that we particularly enjoyed out of the 7+ things we ordered was the kobe beef
Will definitely go elsewhere for Japanese in the future
With so many great places in the Meatpacking Dist
, no sense in wasting your time on bad service and sub-par food
We went with 4 other friends to ONO after having heard so much about it
The service was terrible, even rude, and we waited for our main course for over 35 minutes
The place is very expensive
I was willing to try it in spite of the bad reviews I read on Citysearch
Unfortunately, those reviews turned out to be very truthful
Despite the spacious setting and pretty decor, the space was crowded and loud
My sushi was mediocre at best and of the two that I tried of my friends', one was too salty and one was very bland
More disappointing than the sub-par food was the service
Although servers darted around constantly, those that were capable of stopping by our table seemed as elusive as available cabs during rush hour
The dainty portions, separated by long waits between courses meant that we pretty much never felt satiated
The final blow came when the waitress scorned our 16% tip for the meal
What a waste of time and money
Anyone considering ONO should read all the reviews posted and believe that 20 bad reviews and 2 good reviews is a serious sign
I have been to ONO twice and both experiences have been completely unworth the hassle
Sure, it's a trendy scene, but once they actually seat you (typically an hour after your reservation time), it's not worth trying to be cool
Went there with a few out of town guests to show them a trendy NY restaurant - I was so unimpressed
The food was okay but the service was horrendous! It took 25 minutes for the hostess to seat us even though we had a reservation! It took the waiter about 30 minutes until he took our order
When he finally did it was another 30-40 minutes before our food came out and 15 before they brough us our drinks
They told us they could split the bill at the beggining of the night but at the end claimed they couldn't
It was just a catastrophe
Not worth the money or hassle of dealing with the staff
We had a nice time at Ono
The host and waiters were very accomodating
The front bar has a wonderful bartender
He made an amazing Wasabi Bloody Mary
The food was nothing to write home about
My favorite part of dinner was the Oyster Quail Egg Shooters
They were awesome! We to the rooftop lounge afterwards and it was too crowded
They drinks up there were really crappy
I expected the Hotel Gansevoort's swimming pool area to be much nicer
I ate there for my birthday over a month ago, and I still remember how bad the night was
We had to wait over 30 minutes for our table, even though we had a reservation
They finally seated us at a crappy table that had been open the whole time
The waiter never came to our table and we had to ask for our own menus and water
There were LONG waits in between our courses, but our waiter never stopped by at all
Plus a wine glass fell off a shelf and almost hit my friend who was sitting right there
At least they comped us dessert after complaining to the manager, but I must say I will never return
Went to Ono for dinner with 9 girls on a Saturday night
We were seated downstairs in the back room
We were given a helpful overview of the large menu and made our choices
For appetizers we ordered the oyster shooters, dumplings, and seaweed salad
We then ordered spider, rainbow fresh tuna rolls
all excellent
We tried the kobe beef chicken skewers as well
For our entrees we ordered the duck, the prime rib and the fresh sole
All of which we AMAZING
The prime rib was cooked just right with great flavor
The drinks we ordered were great
We were on a tight time schedule and the waitress helped us along without any one of us feeling rushed
We were all satisfied
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone! P

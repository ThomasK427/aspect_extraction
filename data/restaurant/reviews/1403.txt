Ninja is borderline silly
Ninja is a fun night out
Then the food comes out and WOW
I thought this place was going to be a theme-type restaurant with the Japanese version of Chicken Fingers and a Wacky Burger
The truth is that the food was excellent, presented EXTREMELY well, and served by a smart, sharp and attentive staff
There really isn't a dining experience to compare it to in NY
Not cheap, but worth the money for the food you get
Not for kids, but fun for all
I went there for dinner on a very cold Monday night
The food was great (sushi was out of this world), but the special dishes, the meteorite soup, the crab and grapefruit salad, the lobster with creme fraich, and the shabu shabu were fun and delicious
The ambience is unlike any other restaurant I've ever been to, and if you're looking for privacy, I can't think of a better restaurant
Every party has it's own little house to eat in, and the sliding doors can be closed for additional privacy
All in all, it was a great experience
For people that eat out a lot, a little novelty goes a long way
We had fun there
My girlfriend and I had dinner at ninja, was better that we expected
We had a such a good time
Enjoyed a food a lot, especially the Wagyu beef steak with wasabi sauce and also the fresh sushi witj fresh WASABI!!! was amazing
The place, presentation, taste of the food, the atmoshere, service, but especially the place itself with the staff well worth to go back
Check was
but we left happy, satisfied, with a big smile,
The themed restaurant is really cool; don't get me wrong
However, that theme comes with a price
For the high prices, they give you really paltry portions
The sushi special (Driftwood) was $35 for 10 ubiquitous pieces of sushi
If I am going to pay that price, I should get high quality, unique sushi or I better get more
The food quality was decent but I rather get more for my buck
We went to Ninja NY to celebrate our anniversary and Ninja NY gave us a perfect night
The presentation was amazing, ambiance radiant and mysterious, and the privacy and kind service were highly memorable
The food itself was tasty, and unique
We highly recommend it for the ambiance, food, and uniquness of this restaurant
love the ninjas! the conch was delicious, but unfortunately not much else was
portions small
will go again
but dont expect to go hungry
you will pay $$$$ for a tiny snack
but must try the bonzai dessert
taste is ok, but presentation is amazing
After reading dismal reviews, we were hesitant to go
It is a bit cheesy but still fun
Each 'table' is like its own room, cushioned benches a sliding door
The magicians were pretty good
Doesn't look like $3
5 million decor though
Good variety for sake lovers
Menu items marked by a black flying star have showy presentation
The Meteorite soup is so-so
It was very grainy from the stone sloughing off in it and tasted like tom yum
At $30 a pop, its not worth it
Try the Conch bombshells instead- also 'showy', good flavor, not briney
The rolls are a really amazing
The purple roll, unagi tempura toll and spicy tuna (it was really spicy!) were our faves
They were better than the other menu options in my opinion
And the wasabi and ginger are the best I have ever eaten
Not kidding- try it and you'll see
We tried ninja for an anniversary dinner and was very impressed
It was a little crowded but the attentive service and delicious food more than makes up for it
Wasn't expecting an amuse bouche to start off the meal
Our entrees were perfect, loved the steak wit wasabi sauce, the meteorite soup
The food is ram-packed full of flavor
The unique place, presentation+food, staff, service makes this restaurant one of the best place in NY city
Be back for sure!
After many years of great food in the city - this experience is right at the top
Experiencing the excellent food, presentation and service in our own hut added to the experience
Worth every cent!
When underground you're met by a ninja who will tour you through the village to your private table
It is wonderful the detail put into the village, but it was JUST about to border on kitsch
Until
Our server was superb, a complete sensei of the menu, and all around wonderfully suited to help us enjoy the whole experience!  We had 2 different tastings, so as to try as much as possible
Champagne with lychees, sake
The meteorite soup made at the table is a ceremony not to miss! The only complaint I have is the duck
Sliced to thick and cooked too long
Great sushi!   Dessert? You MUST save room!  We had a wonderful time - it was great to catch up in such a private, well-mannered, beyond tasty restaurant
Be prepared to spend over $100 per person
My girlfriend and I had dinner at ninja
ordered the course menu and couple of rolls from ala cart, than we shared
We loved it
Spicy tuna and the Yellow tail rolls were our favorite
We loved the soup-meteorite or something like that, not sure, had a delicious flavor to it and is cooked at the table, amazing
For an entree we had the lobster, was very thender, ful of flavors
For us just for the dessert, have to go back
Very well presented, and tasty
Had the moonlight and the Bon sai with ice cream
server was very helpful, attentive, the atmosphere is amazing
The food is fresh and each dish has a lot of flavors to it
We'll deffinitelly be back!
This place is great, worth it
Not only is the food superb, the place, atmosphere, staff itself
l am met with with smiles, outstanding courses, excellent sake, ninja coctails and when l leave, smiles again
l have taken friends who leave speechless
High quality of food
The preparation and the dishes are world class
lt was five of us,
we were very impressed
Dining at ninja is always a mind blowing experience
Now each one of us is a fan of ninja
We also tried shabu-shabu, kobe beef, conch dish, salmon, delicious
each dish has a very flavorful taste to it
But the best was the sushi, we loved it
Fish is very fresh and ask for fresh wasabi''

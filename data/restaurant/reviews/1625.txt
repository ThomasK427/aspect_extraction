it is, by far, the worst place i have ever been to in NYC (and that includes the KFC on 2nd Avenue!!)- RUDE and nonexistant service, orders were prepared ignoring special dietary requests, bill was messed up and purse was stolen
This place sucks
Deals at lunch (including thai beef salad) and fries worth talking about
The Scene The decor at this small, dark East Village fixture is basic black-and-white-checked diner, but a panoply of cute toys--clowns, tightrope walkers--buzz and whirr overhead
It all makes for a friendly, slightly off-kilter atmosphere that's reinforced by the homespun but sassy service
A couple of TVs show whatever game happens to be on
The Food Can a burger be healthy? Probably not, but somehow, the tender, juicy fried 1/2-pound slabs of pure beef (or turkey) at Paul's go down easier--and digest quicker--than those at other New York burger joints
There's no skimping on size or variety; the list offers more than 20 burger options, and you'll need a knife and fork to grapple with topping-stuffed specials like the Eastsider (partly because of the delicious ham, partly because the buns are undersized)
Other menu items include Philly cheese steaks, omelettes and sandwiches--and the shakes are good, too
just go
killer burgers, awesome atmosphere!!! the place is small
so what, this is nyc baby, not frikin' texas! the buns are smaller than the burger
so what i'd rather pay to have more meat than bread, which cost pennies to make and it's just a filler anyway! no fillers needed for these half-pound burger beauties! they really go down smooth, no heavy feeling like with other burgers
bottom line, this place is a bargain and it's stupidly delicious!!!
So if you're ever craving half a pound of thick, juicy beef, Paul's is your place
I agree with previous comments that the buns are perhaps a little small, but you can always whip out a knife and fork and find a way to make it work
or just deal and get a little messy
The burgers don't make you feel like you're going to die later either, which I found to be a plus (no guarantees if that holds up with cheese and bacon and etc
added)
The chocolate shake is fantastically rich and overall, great experience, even if it isn't the nicest interior
Also, if you want some killer fries afterwards, Pommes Frites is just a half a block down 2nd
All about the burger! Do not forget the really thick chocolate milkshake(they have a name for the really thick one)(best chocolate milkshake in NYC, anyone?), a beer ot two at less than $4
00 each in NYC, and amazing pickles
Paul's brought my wife around to eating red meat, and for that I THANK YOU!!!!
Hands down best burger in the East Village! Rare with Cheddar and Bacon is the move
Good guys at the counter too
Paul's keeps it real with what must be the best burger in the city, if not on the east coast
I keep going back despite the abundance of other eateries in the East Village
It just keeps getting better better
Long live Paul his place!
Paul's Place serves the juciest burgers with delicious steak fries
Large variety of burgers
Bowls of pickle slices at tables
Paul, the owner, is always there for many visits he /staff are friendly
You will not be disappointed
No one leaves hungry at Paul's
NO ONE
Big juicy burgers, generous portions, all at good prices
It can get pretty busy and the service is sometimes poor but the pros outweigh the cons
For a burger joint you can't go wrong
If you like to eat and you like a good burger you need to eat at paul's
Best burger on the eastern seaboard bar none
This place serves one of the better burgers I've ever had
The burgers are bigger than at other places and the beef was juicy
It's kind of strange that they charge extra for lettuce and tomatoes, but it still turns out being around 5$ a burger; not a bad deal at all considering the quality of the burger
This place has the best burgers ever! The atmosphere is cool
Even though the place is kind of small, it doesn't matter
There are so many things to look at and all, you really don't care
LOVE IT!!!!!
I love New York it is the greatest city and the atomosphere is beautiful
I visit New York often and everytime my boyfriend and friends always go to paul's
I can never leave without one of those many different versions of burgers
i highly recommend it
Its cozy and i lke the decor
remeinds me of a 50's restaurant
The best burger, hands down
I go once a week
Paul's is really worth a visit
A high-quality old New York hamburger joint
The service was fine - really sweet, pleasant guys despite huge crowding
Burger also fine
I don't think the quality of the burger quite measures up to J
G
Melon or that place in the West Village that's always rated 'best burger,' and I do think Paul is scrimping on the bun quality and on the American cheese quality and on the fries quality (altho I did not try the shoestring fries which I probably would have preferred) - but the meat was wholesome and good - and I'm probably way pickier than most people about burgermeat
Historical kind of a place, great atmosphere, all the ambience you are looking for in a lower second avenue hamburger joint in New York City
For people from other parts of the country/world this is a real trip back in time
Gym friends from out of town requested lean protein in the form of beef- couldnt wait to take them to Paul's
Sure, its not grilled chicken breast, but these burgers are top notch without the Fast Food poisons
Seemed like other weightlifters had the same idea- we were not the only ones in there
We preferred to gaze at our burgers while avoiding having to look at the wait staff, but no complaints
PAUL'S PLACE HAS SUCH A GREAT ATMOSPHERE, IT FEELS LIKE YOUR AT HOME
FROM THE WARM WELCOME TILL YOUR FINAL DEPARTURE
THE FOOD IS FABULOUS AND THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT
THE INTERIOR IS VERY INTERESTING WITH PAUL'S COLLECTION OF COLLECTABLES TOO HIS HD TV'S
BIG home made burgers for practially the same price as Mickey D's
Lots of choices to add on
Opt for a kaiser roll ($
25 extra)
The burger is just too big for a standard bun
Also, we always pig out on the pickles they have sitting on all their tables
One small complaint, onion rings are pre fab frozen, so they were a small let down otherwise a great place for a quick bite
forget decor, if you are looking for the best hamburger from a hamburger joint in nyc this place is hands down the best
grilled onions sauted mushroom and cheese as good as it gets
I went to try Paul's palace last weekend cuz I heard a lot of good things about it
The food was good, but the service sucked soooooo badly
I know the place was busy and all I didn't wanna hear the waiter cursing before he took our order
Paul's is great
I was there opening week, and a frequent visitor for yeas until I moved to California
I return to NYC a few times a year, and always to Paul's for the BEST burgers anywhere!
Paul's is most definately the best burger on earth that i have encountered
I don't go there for the service, which is whatever
But damn! can they make a burger
I visit the U
S
quite often, and I am always looking for a great place to eat whenever I go
This time I was in the mood for Hamburgers
Since I was here for a week, I utilized CitySearch and tried all of the Editorial Nominees
Without a doubt, Paul's Palace was by far the best hamburger I have ever tasted
The service was very friendly, and the gizmos and toys added to the delightful colour of the place
I would give Donovon's Pub an honorable mention

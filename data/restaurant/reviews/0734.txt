Go ahead, stop by and enjoy yourself
The Scene The pristine, peaceful, well-designed room, decorated with plenty of blond wood, serves as a dignified backdrop for the healthful food
An open kitchen runs the length of the room, allowing a view of the busy cooks
The front area features a cozy juice-bar counter
Service is casual, well-informed and very friendly
The Food Gobo's food is completely vegan, though not organic
The rich flavors and textures, accentuated by well-crafted sauces and a variety of flavor-enhancing cooking techniques, should satisfy most palates
A dish of chewy smoked seitan evokes Peking duck, while an entree of wide green-tea noodles is served in a tasty faux Bolognese sauce
New England rolls, filled with mushrooms, are excellent
Gobo's scallion pancakes are a bit dry, and the beet salad is low on beets, but the majority of dishes, especially those showcasing vegetables, are delicious in their simplicity
Reasonable priced, tasty, vegan food
Very few bad dishes and the room is quite peaceful
Definitely worth a visit
The dishes in this quaint vegetarain restaurant will make you think twice about vegetarian food
The dishes are delicious and full flavored that you wouldn't image that all the dishes are meatless! The drinks here are pretty good and the price is reasonable
I was quite surprised at the numerous ways seitan and tempeh could be used! Definitely try this place out! I'm so glad that they opened one in the upper east side!
I went there for a prix fix menu on Valentines Day after reading all the great reviews posted
The service was awful and the set menu was tasteless and not exciting
I will never go back again
Went there just last night
The following dishes are a must: roti canai, spice tofu wrap in mango suace, nori tofu wrap, green tea noodle in bolognese sause
The food was amazing
The service was very courteous and couldn't have been better
Ever dish we ordered came at the perfect time
Highly recommended for a vegetarian
The only con I can think of is the seating
I am not a fan of sitting across and close to other tables
But its definitely not a deal breaker
Gobo is an eclectic restaurant that features a juice bar in the front
The food is truly unique and is a vegetarian/radical take on traditional Chinese selections
For variety, try to order different textures as well as taste
The juice selection is incredible, and I would reccomend it over their smoothies
Both the pineapple and ginger-carrot juices were delightful
As is the case with most fusion Chinese fare, I like ordering multiple appetizers rather than two or three main course dishes
Again, I would reccomend doing so here
The wait staff was friendly and really knew the menu
My biggest issue with the restaurant was the lack of ambiance
The seating section consists of a few tables with uncomfortable booths and one extra-long table (think 30 people) where many parties are seated next to each other
Dress lightweight, as the open kitchen produces lots of heat
Food so good it silenced me, and that's saying something
Delightful service, plenty of space - a eye to the kitchen preparations and most importantly, an endless selection of amazing and delicious, healthy food!
This is a great vegetarian restaurant
Everything is scrumcious, so go! Tyr the lentil soup, one of the rolls, and the black pepper seitan hot plate
To die for! The wine selection is good as well
Totally love Gobo! Not only is the food amazing, but they deliver in like 20 minutes! Who knew vegan eating could be so chic?
i have to say this restaurant is pretty addictive
i am not a vegetarian but their food is soooo good that i almost wouldn't mind becoming one
those fresh juice and no-meat food
yum yum
so good
as a party of six, we were asked to split up as the hostess claimed that there was not a table large enough to accomodate us
Looking into the restaurant, we saw that there was a table for four available, as well as a handful of tables for two
They refused to put two adjacent tables closer together, so we ended up sitting on two different tables, with a two foot gap inbetween them
Conversation was difficult, and the service after that was inconsistent and elitist- they even charged us separately and accidentally threw out the leftovers I wanted to take home
However, the food was very good
I was turned away by an immature hostess at the new Gobo location on the UES on 3rd Avenue/81st
I had enjoyed 2 meals there previously and found the staff to be quite inexperienced
Tonite, despite a half-empty restaurant, I was told to wait 30 minutes without an explanation
I suspect they didn't have the wait staff to handle more people but it was quite rude to be turned away
This place was a wonderful surprise
Great vegetarian place to go
I love meat but my girlfriend loves veggies
So I took her here and wow
The food was surprisingly delicious
This place is perfect for that one night you want to go out and eat something different but not too expensive
My recommendation, go during resturant week, they usually have specials and if you are driving there, do not park in front of the resturant without looking at the signs carefully even if there is a meter
They tried to tow my car and gave me a ticket
WOAH!
The space is lovely and the service is sweet (positively midwestern) -- but this ommnivore would rather spend the money on sushi
I'm not a fan of fake meat; the unabashedly vegan dishes do better
The Malaysian curry was the best, with little chunks of soy common to many Asian cuisines and a hint of coconut milk
Adzuki, corn and rice cake was a bit too solid
It's like eating a brick--but it does taste sort of interesting
A bit like Jamaican nut meat
Pine nut vegetable medley lettuce wraps: good, but a bit greasy
Good place to take the vegetarian friends who don't like South Indian
I love eating meat and yet I still found Gobo fantastic! Everything was very tasty and the portions were just right
There might be a bit of wait so make a reservation
Also, the place is a bit loud so don't go if you plan on actually getting real talking in
We went to Gobo this past monday and everything was amazing
The food was delicious and the service was on point
We can't wait to go back for there wine tasting next monday
And there were so many beautifull people there
A really good place to people watch
I had a really great time
I really enjoyed my experience at GoBo
It's a nice 1st date spot, but only if you have a nice single table as opposed to the tight ones in the middle area
The food was really good even though my appetizer was wanting
The deserts and drinks were on point too
Service could be much better though
been dissapointed by many vegan and vegetarian restaurants all over this town (like AK) but i would recommend gobo to friends
not the bland hippie food made by some
on the pricey side for my small pocketbook but worth the treat when i can afford it
wonderful staff with NO attitude other than genuine sincerity
damn amazing for the young and beautiful that work there! like others, i enjoy the butternut squash
sometimes i just stop by for a really good smoothie
good idea to go with a few friends so you can sample various dishes together
but bring money!
This is my fiance my favorite vegetarian restaurant next to Hangawi
Their smoothies are fabulous, and their menu is second to none

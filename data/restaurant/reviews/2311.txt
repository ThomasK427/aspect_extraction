We've been here a few times and have been consistently disappointed
French steak is usually so much more flavorful than this
In addition, I've had to send it back a few times because it was OVERcooked
I like my meat a la Francaise, ie black and blue, and they just don't seem to get it
Worse, the actual quality of the meat is not that good
And they're supposed to be a French place???? Wine list is generally OK, it's kind of hard to find something not from an off-vintage or a lower-level producer
Service is OK, not great
There are so many better French places (Bandol, Orsay, Payard, Brasserie Julien
) in the neighborhood, why waste my money and time here?
Live nearby in the neighborhood so stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night around 8
My friend and I were the only diners under the 50-70 age range
Food was ok, but nothing to write home about
My fish was dry and not very flavorful, and my friends steak was juicy, but a little burned on the outside
Ambience on the covered outer deck was colorless and boring and I was generally disappointed with the place
Orsay one block over is a better option for French fare in the neighborhood
Bistro Le Steak is a great neighborhood restaurant and the food is good too
I had Steak Frites and the roquefort salad and both were really good
I also had a martini and it was nice as well
The atmosphere is cute - just like a french bistro and the service was great
There was no attitude at all either
Now, I have had better steaks, but this is convenient and not hard to get in to
This is great for a low key night and I will definitely go back
Prices good too
my girlfriend had the swordfish which was outstanding
She is a big swordfish fan and really enjoyed her meal
I had the filet which was good but nothing wonderful
The service was excellent
It is true that bistro le steak is not the most amazing steakhouse I have ever gone to but it is a wonderful place in my neighborhood that I enjoy going to for spontaneously special occasions and anytime I want a reliably good piece of meat (the filet mignon is great) in a classy but not stuffy atmosphere
Try the crab cakes as well
Very classy and delicious
Cold by the windows
Bartender annoying and over friendly
This place is great!!! The food is the best in the city
The steaks are the best I've ever eaten
The House Special: New York Cut Sirloin is the juiciest steak I've ever eaten
The Shrimp St
Tropez is one of the best dishes in the place in New York
The service is great also
The waiters waitresses are very helpful, very friendly and quick on service
The overall ambience is great
It's a little noisy but thats what you get when you put a French bistro in the Upper East Side
The management is more than friendly and the chef is one of the best cooks in N
Y
The value is more than fair
This is definitely an ideal French bistro
Used to be good
Last 2 times I ate there the steak was almost well done even though I asked for it medium rare
Tables are much too close together but this is New York
Service is average at best
This place is very cute, but after reading the reviews I was expecting it to be better
The ambience is very nice
The Service was excellent, and everything was great until the food came
Actually appetizers were not bad too, but the entrees were so-so
We were a large group and everyone ordered something different
The only person who was really happy about her meal ordered snails and was raving about them whole night
I haven't tried so can't say
I was looking forward to eating my creme brulee but they burnt it
:( The bill came out to be great, not expensive at all
So I guess you get what you paid for
I visited Sel et Poirve this past Saturday
I was not too familar with restaurants in the area and took a chance on this one
I was instantly impressed when I walked in for my 8pm reservation
I said I was waiting for my dinner companion and they promply sat me at the bar and offered me a class of wine
They asked where I would like to be seated
The menu had a good assortment of dishes
The grilled Salmon was excellent and my companions Steak and Frittes looked equally as good
We were not rushed but the servers were available for our needs
The owner was at the bar when we were leaving and personally thanked us, which is virtually unheard of at most restaurants in NY especially one that you never been to before
We were treated as family
I will surely be back very soon and will also recommend this restaurant to all my friends
sel et poivre is a place i go to with a date
it is charming,fun and great variety of music
the celeryroot and beet salad with a touch of curry and the monkfish with carrot mouse a la orange is orgasmic
you can fall in love here
my friend invited me out to a french bistro
i am not fond of the french, i was alittle hesitant
but when i walked into sel et poivre to my delight we were greeted with a beautiful smile from the owner( who is an american women) and her staff
the food is basic french classic but good
for those who want to be in france with out the french attitude this is the place to be
My husband and I ate here last Thursday
I've lived in the neighborhood for a few years and passed by a few times but have not been inside
We decided to try it and I'm very glad we did
I think it may become one of my standards
I had the steak au poivre which was really flavorful and filled me up! My husband had the monkfish and he couldn't stop raving about it
Overall it was a great meal at a great price
My only complaint might be the beer selection - they didn't really have any dark beers, which I like to have with a steak
But all in all I'm sure we will be back again
Great place for an uncomplicated weekday meal
My husband and I wandered into this charming restaurant quite by accident
We were strolling along Lex looking for a place to eat
We were very pleasntly surprised by the charm and warmth of the place
The ambience reminded me of a French bistro
The food was on the casual side
I particularly liked the chicken
My husband had the sirloin which was also excellent
By far the desserts were outstanding
The creme brulee was great
The owner happened to be there that night and she came to our table to welcome us and make us feel at home
In all the service and food were outstanding and the resturant provided great value for the money
We highly recommend it

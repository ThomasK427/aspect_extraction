The food is still good, but I can get good food many places in NYC
Watch for the new location to flameout somewhat when people get wind of the new attitudes
this place has good food, it's a great value, but the service is quite bad
overall i would still recommend it
the server forgot to bring several items after requesting multiple times
The 'new' Vynl features more than just a new location that doubles the table count: a completely revamped staff is trying to re-create the special atmosphere that the old place had
Or we hope they are
The menu is similar with some refreshing additions to the cool comfort food/Asian diner theme
The cobb salad is fabulous and the ample tuna steak is still the best deal in the city, even though the low price didn't move down the street with the restaurant
Try the meat loaf or the BLT
We dine at Vynl several times a week and will keep coming back hoping they work out the service and kitchen kinks
Walking down 9th looking for a place for breakfast I almost missed it, I thought it was a record store
The main enterance has a bar
Its all about atmosphere, and the food was very good and big portions, not expensive either
The lights are made of vinyl strips
The tables are mosaic vinyl and there are themed shadow boxes on the walls, Michael Jackson, and a few others, the bathrooms are themed as well, Dolly, Nelly and Elvis, I picked Elvis, there is elvis music playing and a full wall of mosaic vinyl King! Fun place
Whenever I have people visit, I always take them to brunch here
The decor can be a bit much (especially with a hangover, haha), but you definetly won't be lacking conversation pieces
The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and a hearty meal for two people was about $22 (with tip)
Two warnings: get there early for the brunches because there is always a line out the door, and this isn't the place to go with a large group of people (most of the tables seat 2-4)
The watermelon mojito is great and the food is decent too
Love it
Wonderful staff, good food, great $
Does it get better than menus in classic album jackets?
Good food, but terrible service
Rude waiters
I would not go back there
Vynl is a great place to eat a good meal at an inexpensive price
The service was great! The cute little waitress bought my veggie dumplings (AWESOME - but they should serve more) quicker than expected
Everything on the menu sounds great - I'm such a picky eater
I 'd definitely go back for the food!!
The service was good -- our waitress was friendly -- but the food had absolutely no flavor! Both of my friends and I had nearly flavorless food
I had the grilled salmon with asparagus and portobello and it was like eating air -- blandness
The prices are pretty cheap, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the food was nearly unedible simply because of lack of flavor
I literally had to force feed myself my meal
Not fun
I had dinner and brunch at Vynl and both times I came out very satisfied
The food is very good (french toasts are soooo yummy) with good variety
Ambience is fun
It's also very inexpensive
I love many restaurants around Hell's Kitchen neighborhood but I have to say Vynl impresses me the most
LOVE Vinyl - always good food, inexpensive and fun
Great if you are on the run too!
I first discovered Vynl when I needed a place to meet friends for coffee before heading out somewhere else
Now it is one of my favorite places to go
It's good anytime, and I particularly love going for brunch
Especially when I have guests in from out of town
There is something for everyone - from the vegetarians to the sweet-tooths
Definitely try the milkshakes (even if you are having breakfast), the omelettes, and the BLT
All-around fun and good service
The Vynl diners' pompous service and posturing make it a place to be avoided! They are a stereotype of pretentious New York hippness
In addition, its over, over cramped seating and mediocre food should dissuade anybody from eating there
All around miserable place to be
a lot of variety here, depending on your mood, plus you can't beat the retro paraphernalia all around
service is pretty good too
I like to stop in here for a late dinner after class
their coconut curries are good, and so are the quesadillas
Creative menu, friendly staff
Nice for pre-theater or just cruising by
Smashed Potato is indeed a smashed potato
Nice bar menu, fresh food, nice for the healthly minded person
then you see the desert menu!!
Consistently an enjoyable, memorable and delicious food experience
I would highly recommend taking your best friends to Vynl, drinking the watermelon lemonade or Vynl cocktail
From the menus to the popstar dolls behind the bar, Vynl has huge amounts of character, great food, service and joy
Great fun place for lunch - or any meal! Recently took some coworkers here for great lunch
Salmon Burger special melted in your mouth, great fries, first rate shakes
Apple, pear cranberry crisp was delicious
Mint tea soothing
Excellent friendly service and quick food
The whole record decor was fun, and the music was perfect
Just one great reasonable place for a fabulous lunch
We just walked by and it looked good
It was! The waiter was very nice and the food was amazing for the price
I couldn't ask for more
Great dinner selection
And the menus are great!
Great place, really reasonably priced for what it offers
All the food is so fresh and well made
Great cocktails too! The staff is nice, the atmosphere is comfy, all around fun great place!
As a customer since this place first opened 9 years ago, you won't find a more fresh or reasonably priced brunch in this part of hell's kitchen! Great for lunch and dinner as well! Can be crowded and the wait can be long sometimes, but it is worth it! The whole concept of LP jackets for menus, great music playing and the celebrity doll collection is a great touch along with some very interesting asian influenced menu selections! Presentation is wonderful, the staff is great and you will love it!
It's reasonably priced
The food is pretty good
I love the album-cover menus, mosaic tables and the Elvis bust
The wait staff has always been attentive and quick
And they always end up playing some song that I haven't heard for years and didn't know I missed until I heard it
I always think of it as a nice place to go for a relaxed mid-week type of meal
The waitstaff is genuinely cheerful, funny and go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience
The food is well-priced,with comfort foods like chicken pot pie
I had the grilled salmon with field greens, and the salmon was better than I have had in much more expensive restaurants
Plus, you get the menus served in old LP covers- mine was the original Michael Jackson Thriller! Dependable
At one time Vynl was the premiere cheap eats spot on ninth, somewhere along the way Vynl lost its appeal for me
The food, once great, is now un-edible
The decour, once downtown cool, is now upper east side kitcsh
I dont know why management changed a great place, but they did so at a HUGE cost
There are so many new places on Ninth now why slum it at Vynl, just to get ill
Nah, not me anymore
THE place to take the family before a Wednesday matinee on Broadway! There is something on the menu for everyone, child or adult
While on the outside Olympic Diner may not look too distinguisable from any other diner in NYC, their consistent service and decent food has kept me coming back
I have never had to wait a long time for the food to be prepared and have always enjoyed their fast, prompt, and amiable service

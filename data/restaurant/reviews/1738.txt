I have had the tasting menu at a number of restaurants all over manhattan, and tabla's was hands down and by far the best
Each course was better than the last, and climaxed in the most incredible dessert I have EVER had (and I normally am underwhelmed by dessert)
The best dish was unquestionably the bass with pomegranites and uni -- the textures and flavors were paired in a way that can be described as no less than phenomenonal
I sent my compliments to the chef after each tasting
everything about this place was perfect
Best dining out experience I have had since 1997
Real expensice though
I loved it
Not typical indian food, rather I would describe it as fusion of indian spices with other cusines from American to European
Everything was presented beautifully and had complex and new flavors that entertained the palette
The service is probably the best in the business
It's expensive but it's also a wonderful experience
Before thought: 'No big deal, another fancy, snooty place
' Booking a table, I confessed my virginity and given a table upstairs (where you want to be)
Early arrival sent me to the bar for a drink
My friend arrived, we went back to the host, and Danny Meyer himself walked in and greeted us
He later cruised the dining room and graciously chatted with patrons
Priceless! Wine-Exceptional!! Finishing desserts, I wanted to try the one pictured on this site
Being served next table, I asked our waitress for 'one of those'
When my second dessert came, there was confusion as my previous plate was still in front of me
I nodded and smiled so he was less puzzled; and was told later that my second choice was free
Danny Meyer is a genius and his staff are second to none
After thought: I can't wait to go back!!!
although it's not traditional indian food, i thought the food selection was wonderful
oh, please
the food they serve is not Indian
This restaurant should not be listed under Indian Restaurants, should be under new cuisine
If you like hip place and the atmosphere is more important than food, then you might enjoy this place
I like real food and real people, this is not my kind fo place
Bread Bar's service was outstatnding, great atmospher and wonderful food
BUT I found it hard to part with my money considering this was technically Indian food which is usually a fraction of the price
Except that it isn't really Indian food
It's food that's been inspired by Indian spices and Chef Cordoz does an excellent job of creating something that could be Indian but really isn't (this does not apply for everything, there are some authentic foods on the menu)
It's also not nearly as spicy as traditional Indian food which makes it a good starting point for the cautious eater
Overall, I highly recommend the Bread Bar; its especialy good for small groups
Six people is optimal to make the most of what the menu has to offer without digging too deep into your wallet
Sharing is the way to go
The service was awesome! We got seated right away although we didn't have any reservations
The hostess, waiters and waitresses were phenomenal
I loved it that there was outside seating and although it was packed, it wasn't too loud
Very pleasant
The food was great and everything looked very cute
Tabla was a disappointment! Having heard the food and flavors were really unique, I couldn't wait to try it
Our party of four each had different items so, we got a sampling of a wide variety of their offerings
Unfortunately, to a person, we were underwhelmed
There was nothing distinctive about any of the courses


Salads were run-of-the-mill, entrees were only acceptable and desserts were a let-down
And, it's way too pricey for what it is


It is a pretty place, though!
Tabla is a great restaurant
The food was excellent; the Indian inspired dishes were bursting with flavor
The space is very attractive, and the service was excellent
The waiter was attentive, but let us have a leisurely lunch, and he was very nice and informative
The $20 prix fix lunch is a must for everyone
I love this place
The service, the ambience and the food! I grew up on traditional Indian food and I enjoyed tasting a new spin on some of the dishes my mom used to make
I had the prix fix dinner with a prix fix wine menu
It was a wonderful experience
All I can say is that I was blown away with the flavors of everything I ate
From the traditional NAAN to the homemade sorbets
AMAZING!!!  The best meal I have ever eaten in New York City in five years!!!!
some friends visiting from overseas suggested we take advantage of the $20
02 prix fixe lunch, and man, were they right! everyone at the restaurant was friendly--and especially accomodating considering we had a one-year-old in tow--and the food was just spectacular
the interplay of flavors was lovely, and the presentation was dramatic
and just when we thought it couldn't get any better, dessert really wowed us
it was well worth braving the subway and streets of new york on an ozone alert day
The best way to describe the food is unexpected flavors! They gave us free samples at the bar, and of course we thought we died and went to heaven! We interacted with about 4 or 5 members of the staff who weren't just friendly, but couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy and satisfied!
We went on a Saturday night with a large (10 people) group -- the food was great (keeps coming) but service was atrocious
We had to ask FIFTEEN TIMES for water, we had no idea what we were eating (due to incomprehensible serving staff), waited 25 minutes after asking for our bill, and were charged a 20% corking fee ON WINE WE BOUGHT THERE
We ate at Tabla on 6-13-02
It was fabulous from start to finish
Upon arrival, each staff member went out of their way to ask us about the theatre (we mentioned we needed to be done in time to make the show) and assure us we would be finished in plenty of time
The food was first rate, from appetizer to dessert
The menu is very inventive, and no, it is not Indian, but infusion, so do not expect to see Chicken Tikka on the menu
What stood out the most was the exceptional service - close to the best I have ever experienced
They really go out of their way to make sure you have the most enjoyable dining experience possible and I will recommend Tabla to anyone
Ate at the Bread Bar here and it was amazing! It is a Danny Meyer place, so the expectations were high, but didn't disappoint
It's not a traditional Indian, so don't expect that, but they do use Indian flavors on their dishes
Go with friends and order a bunch of dishes to share
All are simple looking, but bursting with wild tastes! The seekh kebab was amazing as were any of the breads and chutneys
Best part, the Bread Bar is relatively affordable (~$40 w/out alcohol) and you don't need a reservation
Go now!!
Like all fusion-y cooking, the dishes are hit and miss at Tabla--sometimes they come up with combinations that were probably better left on the drawing board
But if you order right, which must include the Tamarind margarita, it can be worth they hefty bill
But the incredible space is the real reason everyone should go once, if only for a drink
The Scene In 1998, Danny Meyer opened one of the city's most awe-inspiring dining rooms, with soaring ceilings, deco details, butter-soft black banquettes and spectacular two-story windows that seem to embrace tree-lined Madison Park
Green-leaf wood inlays and dozens of Old New York lithographs pay tribute to the historic location
The polished staff treats everyone, from reverent tourists to frequent business lunchers and barflies, like royalty
The Food Kerry Heffernan's brave New Continental menu couldn't be more at home here
Sweet onion consomm with creamy St
Andre ravioli, airy bread pudding alongside paper-thin jamon de Bayonne and cauliflower flan rimmed with barely-seared calamari are bold and balanced starts
Offal-lovers revel in many rich options; the best being crisped pigs feet offset with champagne-mustard jus
Fish--such as pan-seared fluke with juniper studded choucroute, and bone-in brown butter and caper skate--excel
Deliciously fatty braised pork belly adds intrigue to lean loin, but vegetarians' only choice--insanely rich ricotta-squash Cannelloni--steps over the edge
[p]All style and no substance-that would sum up Eleven Madison in a few words
While the service was outstanding and the restaurant itself was certainly candy for the eyes, Eleven Madison didnt live up to the hype, and it definitely wasnt worthy of the eye-popping tab

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu
I personally recommend spending the xtra $ and going with a tasting menu
You WILL NOT be dissapointed
This is a truely incredible night on the town
Once it gets a little warmer out, take your date and a glass of vino out on the open terrace and you have view of the entire tri-state area
I was expecting the handwritten sign by the elevator, so it was not a big deal
The ambiance and the decor were exquisite
I love the harp, so the fact that they have a live harp was a mesmerizing experience
The views are great
The service impeccable
The Food was excellent
The wine recommendations were perfect
Taking my wife to this place made me seem like I now the finer things in life
beautiful setting and interior
Frankly, I was a little nervous going so far uptown, but it had been recommended by someone I trusted
The food was excellent and beautifully presented
The service was pleasant and attentive and they were happy to call a car for our party after we dined to ensure we made our curtain time
I would especially recommend this for a special occasion
When I took my mother she loved it!
Last night, my boyfriend and I dined here in celebration of my birthday on a Tuesday evening
We had a wonderful meal
From the first glimpse of our table to the bonus sweets we received, an evening unsurpassed
Yes, there was a handwritten sign near the elevator button
Yes the harpist was heavenly
The staff was attentive, friendly, and even sweet
The view was not breathtaking, the lights did twinkle and added to the ambience
Oh yes, the food was delicious
Overall, we loved it and are glad we spent our evening there
I recommend it highly
Upon the recommendation of a friend and positive reviews, we went to Terrace to celebrate my husband's birthday
What an awful experience
The lobby of the building made me feel like walking into a dorm
I almost laughed seeing the hand-written note taped near that elevator button that instructed us to use that elevator
The maitre'd was cold and dazed
The view was cluttered and unspectacular - all you see is lights past the window
Don't bother treking over there
I made the reservation 3 weeks in advance of my anniversary and was assured a table by the windows
I called to confirm my table location the day of
When we arrived, we were seated in the back (no view)
We ordered a botlle of wine
Not only did it not come until after our appetizers, it came halway through our main course, and only after numerous requests
The service was rushed and the food was OK but not worth the price
To top it off, the toilets were overflowing and there were no hand towels
MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT
Finally! A place to get some GOOD, QUICK, soul food! Everything is charged according to weight, so YOU, not Aunty Etta Mae, get to decide how much Macaroni and Cheese you want
the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever tasted
Yams are done with cinnamon and raisins, and practically melt in your mouth
The Jerk chicken is tender with just the right amount of spice
Oxtails are of the southern variety, so try them with the okra
Collard greens and rice and peas are also available
There is also a cold salad section, as well as banana pudding and strawberries and cream to round out your meal
As close to 'grab and go' home cooking as you can get
If you miss yo' mama's cookin' here is the place for you! Make sure you have the fried chicken and the mac n' cheese
Okay, so I've never been to the South, but I imagine this is what it's like
I was walking to Popeye's, actually, and ran into this place on the way and decided to give it a shot
HUGE portions
We had the fried chicken and smothered pork chops, both excellent
Mac n cheese that dissolves in your mouth
I got it to go, so cannot comment on service, but I can comment on the quality of the food
Highly recommended
I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and was raised on Southern cooking
This place is just like a slice out of my mother's kitchen; they are one of the few restaurants out there who do grits EXACTLY right
The prices are also really reasonable, so scoot on out there and get some good vittles
The Scene Strictly Roots, which opened more than a decade ago as a dietary alternative to Harlem's more cholesterol- and fat-heavy fare, wears its philosophy on its facade: "We serve nothing that crawls, walks, swims or flies
" This casual cafeteria-style eatery is decorated in Rastafarian colors of red, yellow, green and black and showcases a watchful portrait of Rasta god Halie Selassie
The Food Skip the menu and head for the restaurant's bountiful and ever-changing vegan buffet for an abundance of affordable servings
Specialties include fried tofu balls stuffed with herbs and onions, lima beans, green bean succotash, collard greens and yummy yams
Black-eyed pea balls are another standout
The restaurant is also known for its free poetry nights
I love these folks
they have been imitated many times but they were there first
The Original Gangstas of veggie food, back before it was cool
You will get a bellyful of cheap excellent food and a warm reception from whoever's working there
Also they're right near the Studio Museum in Harlem which is beautiful and has free events like music poetry
The food here is a treat! It's not the fanciest decor in the world but the food atmosphere and service makes it all the better
It's a Jamacan paradise with a plethora of vegetarian dishes to choose from
I highly recommend it!
Around lunch the phone rings nonstop at Jimbo's and the guys behind the counter work like crazy at the grill and deep fryer
If you eat at the counter, you'll be sitting next to the guy barking out orders, and you'll be a few inches away from the cooks, who themselves are a few inches away from the sizzling oil
If you love a great deal, tasty burgers dripping with grilled onions, and a lot of greasy spoon character, you'll love Jimbo's
It can get crowded but I've never had trouble sitting at the counter, even at lunch
It's just far enough from Columbia and its gentrifying grasp, but for how long?
Everyone uptown has known for years that Jimbo's has the best hamburgers in NYC, period!! Not to mention the smack your mama good carrot cake and ghetto delicious fried bologna with fried egg on toast sandwich
Now that Jimbo's has locations all over Harlem, the rest of the city is in on uptown's best kept secret
The best and freshest hamburgers in NYC
If you want fresh beef cooked to order with sizzling grilled onions and thick slices of tomato this is the place to go
If you want to eat in, then go somewhere else the ambiance is non existent and it's best to get your order to go
The Scene It's one of the city's best-kept secrets: Most New Yorkers think it's either just for tourists or out of the way
It's two blocks from the subway and yes, there are tourists, but Sylvia's is also a neighborhood place where everyone is welcome, prices are low and the food is church-supper delicious
The Food The menu is a greatest hits list of soul and Southern favorites
The fried chicken is eternally wonderful, among the best in the city, though the ribs can be a little dry, as can the pork chops
Entrees come with a choice of hearty sides, from macaroni and cheese to candied yams dripping butter, brown sugar and cinnamon
Sylvia's also features a fabulous gospel brunch on Sundays, but it fills up, so reservations are advised
inexpensive, especially for the amount of food on your plate, I don't know how people can say the portions are small
The service is decent, I was there twice on saturday nights, never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated, and things were prompt after that, even though they were really busy
Sylvia is always wandering around somewhere, you can't miss her, she is the woman everyone is having their picture taken with
Sylvias is a nice place to to go soul food, without paying too much
We went there for Sunday brunch
There were a lot of people waiting for table
We waited for about 20 mins for table of 6

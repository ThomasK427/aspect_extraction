The shiitake mushroom and goat cheese sandwhich was simply wonderful, while waitress was a complete biatch
She was French, and for some reason had nothing but attitude for my girlfriend and I
I tried lightening the mood by speaking French with her (I'm fluent and my girlfriend is French) but she just seemed to be an unhappy person
*shrug*
bread is a big favorite of mine
their shrimp salad is incredible! so fresh and delicious: mesclun, jumbo grilled shrimp, avocado, italian olives, grape tomatoes - yum! it's just perfect
their freshly rolled mozzarella and grape tomato salad is great too
a delicious tomato soup
sinful ravioli
great wine that's really well-priced
yes it can loud, yes it can get a little crowded, but if you're up for a non-pretentious good time and good food - this is the place to be
a young eccentric crowd, very down to earth
Yes, the place is full of hip hotties
Yes, the food is pretty tasty and the ambiance is great
But why are the people who work here SO awful? They could care less about anything you might want and are way too busy socializing to even bother working!!! It's sad because if the staff here dropped the attitude this place would rock
Ambience = tile bathroom with funky art Food = bland service = slow The owner decided that his personal IPOD jukebox was too quite and cranked up the VOLUME, when we asked the staff to turn it down they were waived away, when I asked him to turn it down, he turned it UP! He stated he'll pickup the check, it was his favorite song
I walked out
He handed the bill to my guests
This place has great high quality comfort food and portions are big and inexpensive
Octopus salad, goat cheese w/ beats, braised beef were very nice
Small space, so very cramped and can get loud
They had some nice wine also
It's easy to walk past this small place, but the busy crowd waiting around on the weekends should give you a hint as to where it is! Excellent food, great value, very nice managers
Great for a date - not so great for groups, as it's pretty small
Go on a weekday and avoid the crowd!
This is one of my favorite spots in nyc
I've lived here for most of my life and know the city inside and out
watched it go through many ,many changes during my wilder, rawer nyc days
and still, this little place steals my heart
I adore the simple and warm yet hip Italian atmosphere and the staff are darling
Delicious comfort food, mostly Northern Italian
Easy and sweet
As Little Italy (yes, not Nolita) continues to become more commercialized, I can still come home to this fab nyc original
when things were not so pretty but surely special
I either order from or have a sit down brunch/lunch/dinner at Bread every week
Their bread is amazing and addicting--so are their sandwiches and comforting soups
There isn't a single dish I've tried at Bread that I didn't like
My only complaint is the slow service which is apparently typical of places with beautiful people
This is a wonderful place to stop in for a light bite if your in the area
Excellent sandwiches and salad
Their nutella on bread dessert with fresh strawberries is to die for!!! Good location
It is always crowded
The management is not so great but the wait staff is polite
My wife and I tried this restaurant on the recommendation from NY Metro, and it was just as they described
My wife had the sardine sandwich which is their speciality
It was wonderful, as well as they crusty bread they use
It is a great value
This is definitely rank as my favorite restaurant
The best salad I've ever had, I can never get tired of their salads, the paninis are amazing, and the food is very consistent
Very friendly staff, and a lot of hip pretty people inside or outside
Fair price for the value
The salads, sandwiches, soups, beverages, everything here is great! But it is ALWAYS crowded and cramped
Even when I try to order for delivery, they often tell me I'll have to wait an hour or more
So go at off-peak hours
It's totally worth it!
Hot guys, hot girls, THE hip place in downtown New York
Don't miss it
very friendly staff, delicious paninis and tartines
Thumbs up!  (ok that was a little cheesy)
Bread is consistently good - soups,salads, paninis, and pastas are all reliable
It is simple, comforting Italian food that never disappoints
I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Kati Roll
But it inched a little more towards the hate side when I went in the other day to see that they raised their prices again
You have to have two rolls to be full for lunch, period
And yeah they taste good, but $9
00 for two cottage cheese rolls, without tax included, plus a drink is over $10 which is well over my lunch budget
Additionally, the quality is very hot and cold (literally)
Sometimes I'll do takeout and by the time I get it to the park, one block away, it is cold
And finally, the staff is just not nice
They never have been
Even at the one up near times square
Flat out rude
Anyway, with so many inexpensive and delicious options in the NYU area I just can't justify Kati Roll anymore
Its a shame
They had really Bad Service and were very rude to us
Keep in mind that a few of us went there after a night out, so I think anything greasy would have been good
Nevertheless, I believe that you cannot beat these rolls if you consider the price and the quick preparation
The Kati rolls are bursting with all of the flavors of Indian food and they offer a few different types of rolls to suit most people's taste
It's a must if you're in the area and you like Indian food
You're not going here for the ambience; the place is clean, well-lit, but can be cramped if you don't grab one of the tiny tables
But the stuff is cheap and tastes just awesome
For those who don't know what a kati is: it's an Indian-style roti with tandoori chicken, paneer, potato, or other meat rolled up inside, with different spices, chutneys, and if you want (this is recommended) a fried egg inside too
I am a cheap asian and i love lunch specials
This place has the best noodle in the city -i recommend the chow fun (wide flat noodles)- and the best value with their lunch specials
Their chow fun is amazingly tastey with bits of brown beans to add extra flavour
Busy but the in/out traffic is always flowing so you wont have to wait long for a seat
I'm not sure how the last reviewer can call this place horrible
I went last weekend with 8 friends and had a wonderful time! Despite being ridiculously busy, they were able to accomodate us on a Saturday night and give good service as well
The food was very tasty and fresh, and worth a trip away from my usual Chinatown eateries
The ambience is great
very quirky design (a mix of traditional Chinese and cheesey nightclub)
And of course, great value for money
I hate this place so much
The food isnt that great
Very small servings and they charge the same as other resturants that give twice as much
The service is terrible
The waiters/ waitresses were extremely rude
They were so snobby and were acting like they were better than us
Never going back to this place again
Congee is a favorite of my friends and I

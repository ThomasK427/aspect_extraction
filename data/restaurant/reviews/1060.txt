Service was attentive without being over-bearing
Roasted marrow bones were super delicious but definitely not for the faint hearted
A dull sounding pork chop was actually juicy and flavorful with lovely sides of roasted apples and sweet onions
Cheese plate covered all the bases from an aged gouda to a runny and heavenly robluchon
The wine list is truly stunning, can there be better value in NYC, America or the world ? A mix of cult wines (Ch
Musar '97) to the classics such as Pichon-Longueville-Lalande are all priced very reasonably compared to retail
A restaurant for wine lovers rather than hardcore foodies
Simply said, the city needs more restaurants like Landmarc
With its simple, understated food items that always come out more delicious than you could have anticipated and it's ever attentive and down-to-earth staff, this restaurant is a real winner
The last time I was there, I had the most amazing light but flavor-filled salmon tartare and then experienced a completely unexpected flavor explosion with the Cacio e Bevi (sp?) which was basically spaghetti, olive oil and cheese -- but trust me, it was SO much more than that
Then my husband and I took out a mint chocolate chip cone to go
So awesome
The owners should be proud and I can't wait to try out the new location as well as their new restaurant Ditch Plains
I hope they don't disappoint!
a good burger joint, nice wine list by the bottle, but something is missing
good tavern for tribeca
Everything here from apptzr, entree dessert is good
Great people, ambience, staff and food
Lunch Dinner have always been great and good for couples or groups
I prefer upstairs area which is away from the oven, noise tiny bar area
Good value as well
don't recommend their seafood dishes though but mussels are good
The cheese tasting plate is interesting so is their dessert tasting plate
We stayed at the Tribeca Grand for the night and walked around looking for a place to eat dinner at 10 pm
Though we had to wait a half hour or so on a week night (this place is hopping!), it was worth the wait
We were seated upstairs, a little less noisy, steaks and calves liver EXCELLENT
Half bottles of wine were SUPER w/ great selection
Service couldn't be better
Can't wait to go back!
This place is great! The wine list is wonderful and the bartenders are super friendly and know a lot about all of the wines on the menu
The food is so great as well
I have only had the steak here but it is definitely such a great value for the $
Def get the butter with steak! The fries are amazing as well! One of my favorites!
The main reason I go to Landmarc is because of their wine program offering half-bottles for essentially the same price that other restaurants charge for by the glass
That said, the bistro-type fare is equally tasty (particularly the steaks and other grillled items) and portions are generous
I don't think the desserts quite match up to the rest of the menu, but the home-made caramels presented with the cheque are a nice touch
Service is friendly and discreet
Definite worth a visit if in the neighbourhood
A very diverse and appealing menu, and even better food
Our wait was short, and more than worth it
As the previous reviewer mentioned, the wine list is great on both price and selection (half bottles that are actually interesting)
Toughest part of the night was choosing what to eat, and the steaks and pasta were both winners
met my girlfriends here and were sad we had to wait for everyone to arrive to be seated
but WELL WORTH THE WAIT since we got the curved plush banquette upstairs
it was like our own private room, drowning out the din of the surrounding patrons
the food was awesome (i had the portabello steak), the waitress was hilarious and attentive, and the wine pricing and selection (and recommendations to our taste!) were tremendous
be sure to check out the one of each dessert tray and hunt country ice wine after dinner
yum! I felt like a celeb!
With a recommendation from a co-worker, I headed to landmarc with clients in tow
I expected to wait, but where? The bar area was so cramped I felt embarresed with my guests
The staff would tackle there way through the crowd, with out much choice I suppose, to get to the dining room
Dumb layout
The hostess, attractive to the eye, but unpleasant and filled with attitude set the tone for what would be a domino effect of error
The wine list was a bargain, but with close-out wines, what would you expect
My nicoise salad arrived with NO tuna! When the entree's arrived they came in intervals
Two meals then a 10 minute wait and then two more
I actually liked the dessert idea, but when it arrived parts had begun to melt
Talk about bursting a bubble
Get it right first, then try the attitude!
Congrats to Landmarc for winning Citysearch's 2005 Best Upscale Casual Dining
They absolutely deserve it
I can not think of another place in the city that it is so welcoming so all kinds- dates, business dinners, families- lots of children earlier in the evening, late night dining- till 2 am all week
The rezzies policy can be tough but the staff is always eager to offer options
Great service, one of the only places in the city where not only the waitstaff but also the hosts will recognize regular customers
I was excited to try this restaurant for my friends 30th birthday
Called to make a reservation and the person who answered the phone was so cold
I asked if I could make a reservation for 5 and she replied that they only take reservations for 6 and up
She then proceeded to read me their rules and policies
I asked if there was anyway they could accommodate us, she then proceeded to read the rules and policies again! I was so excited to try this restaurant but was really put off by the person's rude and condescending tone
I just wish she was a little more personable and then maybe we would have tried it out
Oh well, if I knew I was going to be read a script it would have been better hearing it from a recording then a rude person
Great meal, nice restaurant/layout
Impressive menu, even more impressive wine list
The wait staff were a bit lacking unattentive
didn't refill our wine glasses, etc
Limited, unethusiastic dessert menu
but overall its good place to dine
Landmarc is a favorite and habit forming whether its a weekday night, a late night or a weekend meal
The menu is steady and strong
If you are in the mood for steak, fish, poutry or pasta - they have it
The mussels are very good and the sauce options make them interesting on each visit --and the fries are yummy
The wine list is affordable and the former Blue Fun bartender is always helpful
Ok
the restuarant is weak in desserts, but that is ok for a favorite neighborhood upscale place
Anyway, given the no res policy and lines to get in, dessert would only slow table turnover - I'll gladly go elsewhere if I want a big dessert that badly
A group of friends and I went to Landmarc recently
ALthough we had to wait for a table for quite a while, it was eventually worth the wait
The food was excellent, the service was great (real friendly waitress) and the price wasn't bad either
Overall, it ended up being a great night, with a little celebrity siting to boot!!!
My friend and I visited Landmarc for the first time last week and we were very satisfied with our choice
We were a little disapointed by the menu at first, which is very standard but our food was amazing
The wine list is very impressive and CHEAP!!! They have this no mark-up policy which enables you to afford wines that you would'nt be able to in other restaurants
The service is excellent, our waiter was very friendly and professional and we were seated right away, which is a rare thing in NYC
Reliable place for good food and service without paying high premium
Everytime I have been to Landmarc I have had an absolutley amazing time
I travel a lot and am always looking for places to entertain my clients
Some people hate the no res policy but I can't count the number of times I've actually had a reservation and had to wait for my table anyways
Besides the bartenders there are amazing and help keep you entertained while you wait
Consistently good comfort food with an exceptional wine list
And a restaurant where hosts and servers remember your name

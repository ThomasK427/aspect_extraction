Even tough some people said that this place over-rated before we went
I am glad we didn't listen to them
The staff was okay and it was affordable
I enjoyed my self
I think this restaurant is severely over-rated
The food tasted like it was poured out of a can! I went after church and could have done without the singing
I was the one in my group (from out of town) that insisted on stopping here
It was a big mistake!
Sylvia's is teriffic, the service and the food lived up to the hype
Sylvia is extremely friendly and very attentive
I had the ribs (which were great), but take note,there is also a section for lower-calorie items too
Sylvia's is surviving on reputation alone
My family went one Mother's Day because it was one of her favorite places as a teenager
We all found the waitstaff to be inattentive and the food either bland or salty
We are never going there again
I have been to this restaurant 2 times in the last month, and I have no cons to write about
It is definately one of the friendliest restaurants in NYC
The trip is copletely worth it
We took my parents who are suddenly all about The Food Network, and anything they profile, they want to see
So they were psyched to go
The ribs are out of this world
The chicken and waffles are tremendous, and that iced tea! Granted, if you have brunch there, you probably won't eat later, but it is soooo good
The singer on Sunday was really super, and loved what she did
Such a great experience
Just go
Although we waited 20 minutes for a table for 4, outside it was fine, but I imagine it would be cold in the winter
I love this place and always try to take visitors here
Really that's just an excuse to get some corn bread, black-eyed peas and greens! The fried chicken is some of the best around
The portions are generous
The prices are good
There are lots of tourists and usually at least one tv crew
If you can get in - go for the gospel brunch
Deserts are great too though usually - there's no room left for desert! You may have to wait to be seated but the service is great
Highly recommended and worth the trip
As an out-of-towner, I heard about Sylvia's by word of mouth
My sister I decided to stop by on our return from downtown Manhattan
We both decided to take our dinners home and I found the service to be courteous and fast
The portion sizes were very hearty
I ordered the fried chicken, yams, macaroni cheese, collard greens and corn bread
The chicken was some of the best I have eaten
My sister ordered the ribs, macaroni cheese and string beans
She was also quite pleased
The only draw-back is parking
Parking is very limited
We had to walk several blocks but it was well worth the stroll
Sylvia's reminds me of The Gingerbread House in Oakland, CA which serves Cajun style food and is family-owned and operated
It took a while for us to get seated, food was nothing spectacular; overseasoned and salty to be exact
Would I go back? Only to see if there are any stars there
That's probably about the only good thing about it
You might see someone famous
And if you don't really care about that, no need to waste your time and money
But nothing's better than first hand experience so go ahead, give it a try
You may like it
I ate at Sylvia's 20 years ago and the food was wonderful
I just dined there last week and what I had was not good at all
The greens were bland and undercooked, the ribs were too large, undercooked, sauce not good, the yams were way too sweet and didn't taste like real candied yams
This is just not how real soul food is suppose to taste like
The staff though was real nice and friendly
I'm sorry but I don't see myself going their anymore unless I hear that their food has improved
I went to this restaurant last night to check out their cigar lounge
I was told by the hostess when I got there that they no longer had the lounge
The did not sell cigars any more and there was no place to smoke
Even though their website still brags about their cigar lounge, trust me, it no longer exists
I didn't stick around to try the food or drinks, so I can't comment on those, but the place had a lot of people and everyone looked to be having fun and enjoying the food and drinks
My boyfriend and I visited this place for the first time on a Friday night and we have reaffirmed our faith in NYC restaurants
We had everyone, from the hostess to someone I think was the manager or possibly even the owner, asking if everything was ok and if there was anything we needed
The Pecan Crusted Chicken Breast was succulent, very well seasoned, and quite generously portioned, with the Mexican Rice and Spinach creating a wonderful ensemble
My boyfriend had the Sliced Hanger Steak and was literally comatosed from how tender, juicy and flavorful everything was
The Mango Glazed Chicken Wings are a Must as an appetizer but make sure to ask for extra Mango Sauce! And did I mention the drinks? No rationing bartenders here! Extremely good Margaritas and capping the night with a shot of Patron might be a good idea as well
Took forever to take our order, when I asked for ketchup the waiter gave me a nasty look, cuban sandwich was horrible
stingy on the meat with stale bread and oily limp fries
My boyfriend and I went there on a weeknight, so it wasn't crowded and we walked right in
The nacho appetizer was better than those at other Mexican restaurants I've been to
The food on a whole was just ok though
Nothing that special or different
The brownie dessert was horrible though, it tasted like something heated in a microwave
Our waiter kept saying he's sorry for rushing us, but he really wasn't so we thought that was weird
Finally checked this place out one Sunday afternoon
The food here was fine
wasn't great, but wasn't bad either
It was fair
We got our food quickly! HOWEVER THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE
The waitress was seemingly taking a break while waiting on us
I could actually see her sitting down and eating
I have been a waiter before so I understand eating for a minute, but she just plain didn't even CARE! I probably would have drank 4 drinks if she had ever came to the table to check on us
My girlfriend had to get up herself to get catsup and hot sauce
I had one beer and then waited about 20 minutes before my girlfriend finally waved at the waitress to comeover and get me another drink
If service is really important to you avoid this place at all costs, the MARAGRITAS are top of the line though!
This is a great place to hang out during the week or on an early Friday night before hitting the clubs!! The margaritas are a great price and the food is fresh and not heavy like most Mexican restaurants
The DJ they have on Fridays and Saturdays plays all different types of music but thankfully mixes it up
The crowd is diverse and every time I have been there the place is nearly packed!!
I have lived in the upper east side now for a number of years and for whatever reason i have never made it to mustang before last Tuesday night( honestly i am not usually big on mexican food)
So my sister convinced me to give it a try
I had a really good time
I got the roast chicken which was excellent and we shared the mussels which were just as good
MARGARITAS WERE AWESOME! My waitress was suprisingly attentive and friendly compared to what I've been experiencing lately at other UES restaurants in similar price range
The music was kindof hokey
(I actually laughed at some of their song options)but generally all around a great time
possibly the worst dining experience ever
Know that if you order a margarita, they give you the 'big' size and charge you the extra money

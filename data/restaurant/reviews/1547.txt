Their congee was fantastic
We ordered tons to food that we were familiar with
One bite and we looked at each other in utter shock
It was totally homemade food
Not like other restaurants food
I highly recommened their congee and fish dish
awesome place, cheap good food, cheaper drinks, really fast service
get there before 8ish pm if you want fast seating, it gets really packed around 830 fri and sat nights
kinda cheesy decor but you're absorbed in the food so ambience doesnt matter
waiters seem to be patient with non-cantonese speakers but it might be better to go with someone who does speak it
overall worth it
I went here on a Sunday night with 2 friends
We waited about 10 minutes for a table and enjoyed peanuts and cocktails at the bar (drinks are $3
50!)
For dinner we sampled appetizers, pork buns, meat and vegetable dishes, as well as two congees
All the food was fresh and flavorful, especially the country style crab and greens with garlic
The food is real Cantonese, and for those who might find frog and intestine intimidating, there are plenty of familiar Chinese dishes available
The service was not overly friendly, but the waitstaff was very attentive and more than satisfactory
The restaurant is large with lots of bamboo and Chinese decorative touches, but is not tacky
There were many families there and they have large tables to accommodate groups and family-style meals
We enjoyed it so much we're planning a party there next month in one of their private rooms
I went there for dinner
The food was good and had a lot of flavor
I really enjoyed Pan Fried Flounder - the fish was so fresh, outside was crispy, inside juicy
I also like the ambience, as it has an interesting structure and design that make this place feel/look like a non-Chinese restaurant
Service was ok, though
Although we made an appointment, we didn't find out our name when we got there(though we were seated promptly)
And when we tried to order some additional food, they said they don't really want to do it because it would take 15 minutes to prepare - obviously they wanted us to leave because there were people waiting outside
So if you go, make sure to order enough and go early
We made a reservation for 5:30pm (20 people) and people were still arriving at 5:45 (over half the group was there) when the manager came over and literally yelled at us for not being on time saying it was a busy time for him, when in fact there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant
It was incredibly rude and unprofessional of him
And then the service was just bad throughout the night - temperamental waiters, they said they ran out of Congee which we found hard to believe since that's what they're known for
There were 2 who throughout the night were very nice and tried to make up for the rude behavior of the manager/owner but the impression had already been ruined by that point
Love this place
Live around the corner and go there as often as possible
The bar's terrific, staff awesome and the biggest menu for the best deal
An efficient and pleasant pillar of the local restaurant community
Cool decor too
Although not the best decor, congee is very good - especially the salted chicken congee! The best dish, by far, is the house special chicken
It's deep-fried, juicy and smothered with garlic
Probably the best chicken I've ever tasted! Somewhat agree with the previous reviews about service and the long wait but once seated, the food is well worth it
My friend and I were seated right away and served extremely promptly on a Monday night
Maybe all the bad reviews are from weekend guests
The soy sauce chicken (which they call house special) is some of the best I have ever had, and the black pepper scallops were also excellent
The beef satay dish we ordered was more like pepper steak treated with a meat tenderizer though, and was kind of yucky
The complimentary sweet ginger flavored congee they give you for dessert is the first congee I have ever had, and was very good
I may even try it again!
I took friends to Congee Village twice
The first time they said we would be seated in 10 minutes, and 45 minutes later, after they'd completely forgotten about us, we decided to leave
The second time i went there I made a reservation because of my prior experience
I got there early to find that they had already given my table to another party
An hour later they still were not able to seat us, so we left yet again
There are so many restaurants in Chinatown that are so good
I don't care how good the food is supposed to be here, the service I received is not acceptable
The congee and other food was great
And there's a bar
The wait was quite long though
This restaurant came highly recommended by loads of my friends, so I was really looking forward to going
It was a week night, so the place was pretty busy
We were a party of three and were placed on a square table that was placed against the back wall, so that we had to sit in a line with our backs facing the room
We were also squashed in behind two huge tables
We ordered three entrees, one of which never arrived, and the other two came about 15 minutes apart from each other (both dishes no better than what I order at my usual take-away)
We gave up being polite, and tucked in to the already cold food and cancelling the final order
The service was terrible, they ignored us and didn't seem too concerned that our food was late/ non-existent
Doubt I'll waste my time going again
The location is a bit scary at night if you intend to travel there by subway
It was the loudest restaurant I think I have ever eaten at, though, there was a table of about 15 drunk, young men right next to us
Congee is first rate with top notch ingredients
If you love abalone, get a congee with chicken and abalone, they use fresh abalone here
They give you 5 good sushi sized slices of abalone in this $4
75 dish, plus lots of chicken!
but also good authentic cantonese dishes
Steamed fish, salted fish-pork patty, satay beef
etc
all very good dishes
havent tried a bad dish here yet! Decor sucks but it's about the food right? service wasn't the best but satisfactory
Just good food for cheap price
Give it a try
enjoy!
located in 'extended' chinatown area (chinatown has long reach into other ethnic areas over the yrs) - 1st reaction - parking sucks, but were soooo lucky to get a legal space with no meter
food excellent for value price (dishes at least $1-2 cheaper than 'in' chinatown, congee/jook variety is great!)
beef chow fun is a tasty best buy as well as jook
didn't like sticky rice
they offered cute toddler chair
decor is homey village - 3 floors of wood/bamboo, bar is modern w/ 3 tv's
nice for small banquets/groups
karoake rooms downstairs! SUM IT: tried many chinatown spots, this is the best with good variety all tastee! good for the wallet! we may hold our baby party there!
I am a convert, thanks to Congee Village
Never liked congee, until I tried it at Congee Village
It was terrific
Highly recommended
If you're looking for authentic cantonese food, this is the place
It's not Americanized Chinese food, so don't come if you're not adventurous
Vast menu, good prices, and huge portions
This is one of my favorite places in Chinatown, the food is very authentic, the menu is increbibly vast and even on crowded weekends, everyone tries to provide a fast service (although sometimes slightly rushed)
The congee is great
The various forms of chicken are a must and the place is perfect for large groups, including kids
In fact, the bigger the crowd, the better, as you can share more and more dishes
But, you come here for good food, not for ambience
The best of all: it's amazingly cheap!

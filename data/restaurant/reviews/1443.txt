Proprietor Natalie was great! Will definitely be back
Las Ramblas is nothing short of fantastic! It is a quaint tapas bar, perfect for a couple of friends or a date
All of the food is exquisite! My personal favorites were the meatballs and the shrimp dishes! Try everything, all the food is great! Everyone was so attentive and friendly
And Natalie was very knowledgeable when it came to the wine selection
In short it is a must see!
As self proclaimed foodies, my date and I LOVED this restaurant
Natalie, our waitress, is now one of our favorite people in Manhattan
Everything she suggested, from food to wine, was perfect and she is so, so nice
The food is incredible, and although the restaurant is small, it is not overly crowded and I felt like we were the only two people in there (even though every table was taken)
Gentlemen, if your looking for the perfect place to take a date, this is it
The food was excellent and the waiter was a sweetie
It's real small, but that's fine if that's what you're looking for
It was my two girlfriends and I after seeing a play
We ordered a bunch of stuff, all fantastic, and sangria which was friggin' delicious
They don't have regular table seating
It's either small, high tables with high stools or one table by the window
Very romantic without being cheesy
I would go again, but don't go if you're looking for a big dinner
Although, you could just order lots of tapas! The prices are great
I had never had Spanish food before going to Las Ramblas
It was not at all what I expected
I thought it would be like the Mexican food I've always had growing up in California, but it was a far cry from the ordinary stuff I was used to
I can't wait to go back and try out more tapas
Very exotic, tasty stuff
Stumbled into this new restaurant by accident, and had an enjoyable time
Decor, food, and service are excellent
The space is cozy, with wood/brick decor, and cool fixtures and bar
Went on a Wednesday, and had no trouble getting table
Other guests had an international flair
Very genuine place, and a great new addition to the neighborhood
Asked the helpful staff if it is part of chain, and they said the owners had a few restaurants (including Burito Loco nextdoor), but that it's a new creation
Will definitely go back, although next time, intentionally
Las Ramblas - keep doing what you're doing, and treat your staff well!
I dont have words to describe this Tapas bar is an awesome place to hang out having a good time
and good beer nice and cold
You shoul try LAS RAMBLAS
Great wine!!! Tasty tapas! The service is warm and friendly
What a great place! Incredibly authentic! The food is incredible, the wine list is nice and well priced, the icy beer tap is great, and the people are warm and knowledgeable
I definately will go back and back again
Favorites were the Gambas St
Martin, the meatballs, basically, everything I've tried yet
The space is tiny and intimate, so if you score a table, or a good seat at the bar, you're set for the night
I recently discovered a great new little restaurant in the West Village -- Las Ramblas
My husband and I often visit Spain and we particularly love Spanish food
Much to our surprise, Las Ramblas surpassed our expectations
This cozy tapas bar has some of the best food in town and the service is unquestionably superb
Along with some cold beer from a ice sculpted tap, we devoured some gambas al ajillo, jamn serrano and a mouth-watering tortilla espaola, all delectable indeed
Ol, ol, ol!!!
After living in Spain for seven years, it was a pleasant surprise to find the same food I so much enjoyed there
It brought back pleasant memories of Bars in Madrid and Barcelona
Missing is the Cerveza Mahou but it'sstill easy to imagine that you are eating in a good Spanish Tapas Bar
Service was excellent
Defitely woth it!
After being in Spain almost 3 months ago, my friends and I were craving some authentic tapas
We gave Las Ramblas a try and we were beyond surprised
The restaurant is small and beautiful and the food is like I remember in Spain
We must have had over 14 dishes and each one was better then the last
The most amazing part was the ice beer tap
The best beer I have ever had
I highly recommend it
A+ in my book
This place was great, I loved it and so did my friends- one of my favorite places to go to relax
Reminded me of sitting at a bar in spain drinking vino and eating those yummy tapas =)
Everything was absolutely delicious! I went on a date with my boyfriend; it was so romantic and perfect
So, I came back with my girlfriends for wine after work one night
The employees knew so much about the wine and tapas on the menu it was amazing, and nice to see people who cared so much
Everything was perfect, the ambiance/food/drink/price/service
I highly recommend this place
I had a great time, and will definitely go back myself A LOT!
Went for a romantic after hours date and conversation
A few minutes after food arrived, we were asked if we were already done
It felt like a take out place
Food was comparably mediocre
If you ignore all that, atmosphere and the place would've been okay, but frankly around this area, any high end hotel lounge/bar is better than this
This is my favorite new place in the city! I am from Texas and have specifically returned to the city to eat here many times bringing fellow Texans with me
The food, decor, wines and especially the people are beyond compare
Food is always fresh, tasty and never ceases to tantalize and make me crave more
The decor is such that I want to live in exactly that kind of space
Above all else, the people of Tintol have become some of my best friends
Already planning my next trip in a few weeks just so I can go eat there
Fantastic ! We had such a good time
We will defintly come back
Tintol is a terrefic space
It's a very good loking space
Tha staff is atentive and  gracious
I love the Tapas
It's a realy Tapas Bar
A lot of choices and the food is terrific
We loved the Chourizo flamed w/grappa, the stufed Calamari the Fry deviled  eggs and the Griiled Octopus is to die for
For desert You must try thr Chocolat Salami  By the way one must try the Poncha
The wine list it's fun and most of the wines  are very well priced
The rodizio here has a couple of very good items--the top sirloin and pork sausages were excellent
Many other cuts were underseasoned though most everyone could find something they like and cooked the way they like (the chicken hearts' rubbery, flavorlessness excepted)
Th salad bar is just ok
Too many mayo-laden items, afterthought sushi, fried calamari with marinara? The parade of carbs--do we need tepid yuca firees and regular fires and mashed potatoes is superfluous; better to put some of these on the salad bar
Wine list is short but has some nice selections but some markups are ridiculous: e,g
, Numanthia '03 $100 ok ($45 list), but Gago '03 $57 ($13-20), Goats Do Roam $37 ($8)
Service tries hard but pushes food too fast once it gets going
Linger and wait for what you want
Porcao's a great option for group dining with your carnivore friends, and younger, hipper than Plataforma

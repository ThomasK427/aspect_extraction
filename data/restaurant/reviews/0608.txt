the steak frites and duck confit were very delicious
service wasn't particularly attentive, and you can hear everyone's conversation around you
This place was quite charming! The butternut squash soup was different and delicious
Don't order the regular salad greens because it's nothing special and some of it already comes with the steak frites
The steak frites were superb
Juicy and tender, and the frites were so yummy
The atmosphere was dim and romantic
The service was quick
There needs to be a better way to display the menu, instead of chalkboards on chairs, that would keep falling down
The dessert of coconut and banana tart was absolutely heaven
A definite must try! Be careful looking for the main door
You have to enter on ludlow, where the bar is, not the building labeled epicerie
Many patrons were throughly confused
What once use to be Baby Jupiter and the adjoining bar that staged underground and maverick musicians has been turned into a simple yet charming little French restaurant and bar
Epicerie's walls display French nik-naks (mostly French labeled food goods, bottled water, etc) and in the adjoining Bar Charbon that is candle lit has a makeshit smoke shop (just wonderful for fellow smokers) and has been transformed into a cool lounge eatery
The food was good
The Mahi Mahi w/bacon was tender and tastey
The crispy chicken w/stuffed roasted peppers was good, nothing special
The mussels w/french fries were good, but I've had better
Overall, it was good
I know they are trying to be very French bistro with the chalk board menus, but 3 times at 3 different tables the chairs fell over
They need to get printed menus
I was beginning to wonder if Epcot had invaded my neighborhood from the crazy facade on the LES
That's when I decided to eat at the when I made the wise choice to eat at the Epicerie
The wine list is excellent as is the service
Most importantly, the food is authentic French bistro fare
The coq a vin is especially delicious and the mussels are fresh and lovely
A great spot for a tasty, well-priced dinner
GREAT PLACE TO DINE, DRINK, AND HANG OUT
THE FOOD IS FABULOUS, THE CHEF IS GREAT ASK TO MEET HIM, VERY ATTENTIVE
THE MOJITOS ARE WONDERFUL
HANG OUT AT THE CIGAR LOUNGE, YOU'' L HAVE A BLAST
AMBIANCE IS ELEGANT, DECORE IS OLD WORLD, MODERN AND VERY ROMANTIC
DONT GO EXPECTING FAST FOOD, SLOW DOWN TAKE YOUR TIME, ENJOY THE MOMENT
after looking this up on city search to decide to go there or not, the recent reviews have been accurate
very happy with the food, the tuna tartar as an apetizer was excellent, and we also enjoyed the meaty baby back ribs
shrimp scampi had some sort of plantation thing in the center that my belly loved
The resteraunt decor is so so, but the food and servce were excellent tonight, although i wish they had a bread basket
Not expensive either, under 100 for the 2 which in my opinion is a bargain
i went on a thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty the server got our drinks wrong 3 times! THEN he comes back and asks my friend how would she like that cooked, um she ordered CHICKEN
yes rare please!!! lol, so at this point i'm ready to leave but i had already valet'd and i live in queens
SO 15-20 minutes later 4 waiters decend upon us with the most magnificent looking entrees! now i have eaten at nobu, tao, blt etc
can i just tell u how floored i was by this meal (i had the pork loin), my friends terayaki chicken (well done
lol) was also amazing! the presentaion, out of this world, the servings, big, the filet mignon was delish even though it was beyond butterflied (only complaint)
so needless to say, after a very bad start i am glad i stayed! it is worth the trek!
I had the most wonderful experience here last night
I wanted a nice glass of wine and a decent bite to eat before heading home
I was about to settle for a local bar when I remembered Hispaniola just a few steps away
I was immediately greeted and offered a table and something to drink
Water was brought promptly to the table and it only took a few moments to receive a menu
I was really impressed with the variety and asked my waiter for a recommendation between the Goat Cheese and Spinach Stuffed Chicken or the Sea Bass with Cous Cous
I went with the Sea Bass and was blown away! Besides the overwhelmingly delicious Sea Bass, I was introduced to the ever so grateful chef! I highly recommend that you make the trip up to this exceptional restuarant!!!!!
I was just there yesterday
I had the most surreal experience
I was on a date
I was blessed with a very romantic ambience (the candlelights, the dim lighting, the music)
The service was excellent
The waiters were very attentive
I did not have to remind them to fill up our wine glasses or our water glasses
The food was exquisite
I had the balsamic garlic filet mignon
It was tender and very flavorful
My date had the lobster tail special (again another winner)
Our dessert was the flan (what a masterpiece)
If you dine here, you will be equally satisfied
The presentation gets a 10++
This is a great find in Washington Heights
The chef is an outstanding saucier
The fish is always cooked just right, the dishes are imaginative, but be careful if you order red wine
It is kept next to the motors for their fish tanks, and it makes the wine very warm, almost hot
On one occasion the server just refrigerated it until it was room temp, but on another occasion, a server brought us a glass of ice instead (to put the cubes in our wine
no, I'm not kidding)
So the ambiance is great and I have had some really delicious meals here, but the service is questionable
Expect at least one thing to go wrong when you are dining here
that the Heights to offer, geez, well, then competition, should be easy
They definetely need to train their staff
The hostess and wait staff, just seem as they were to busy doing their own thing to fully give their customers the required attention, exhibiting just the minimum attention
The food was just okay, I'm sure there's a Mom and Pop restaurant 'round the way that can beat it
Definitely not worth the dough
The food at this place is great and the decor is swanky without trying too hard (like a few other places in the Heights)
The service could be better but the management (Mariano) is quite helpful if there are any problems
I have taken many people here and they have all enjoyed it
Oh, except the steak
NO STEAK
I just went this past weekend
I thought the place was nice, the hostest was great
The tapas were also good, but the waiter had no clue of what his job was, he was nasty
This was the only true bad part about it
Guys you need to be careful with your staff they might ruin this great place you got going!!!!
This is just what this area needed to liven up the scene
The lunch I had was fantastic
The ambiance is a tasteful and the upstairs is your best bet
There is also a private room for functions where you can get all you can eat tapas
The service however was slow and unattentive
I even tried to get in touch with the manager to hold a private function, but I received no responce for 3 weeks
Bad service but great food
They need improvement, once done, It'll be great
After waiting a year to try this place my friend and I finally went this weekend
We were very disappointed
The food is mediocre at best, the snapper had no flavor, the merluza over cooked and the filet that was given to the table next to us was the size of a childs steak portion

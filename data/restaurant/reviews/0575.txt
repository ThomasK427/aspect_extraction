Casual yet nice atmosphere with indoor and adorable outdoor dining
The pressed sandwiches are delicious and such a break from the ordinary
They're really more like a meal
Calling them sandwiches doesn't do them justice
GREAT (afordable) wines too! I got out of there having had a hot pressed sandwiche, cucumber salad, and a glass of wine for under $14
What a deal!!!
Best sandwiches west of the Mississippi
Try anything with smoked gouda or garlic spread
Excellent gazpacho
My friend and I had dinner there last Tuesday night not only did the waitress remember us she remembered the wine and what we ate from 2 weeks before
We sat and relaxed and never felt any pressure from anyone to leave
The Hudson Salad and sandwich were yummy we ended the meal with homemade cheesecake that she suggested, it was amazing
Press 195 is a place I continue to go back to
I always enjoy and are truly pleased with the food and service
You can order something different every time and you don't have to worry
It's all good!!I also enjoy whenever anyone visits me, it gives me a chance to go back to Press 195
Try it once and you'll be back over and over
If you have a craving for a sandwich, then you must visit Press 195
Once you try a pressed sandwich, you'll never go back to a regular sandwich again
The atmosphere is wonderful, the service is great
Visit on a warm evening and enjoyed the backyard setting
Any sandwich or appetizer on the menu is delicious
You will never be disappointed
my husband and I went there after a long workout at the local gym
i am on a stringent diet that allows for a solitary cheat day: mine are on saturdays so it is to no surprise that i am very picky about my meals on cheat day
i heard about this place from local realtor
my husband is a fanatic about sandwiches (he ate a lot growing up in sweden) so we decided to eat here
it was like hitting an oasis
the selection was for everyone, for the vegetarian to the carnivore
i had sandwich number 6
my hubbie had the ham with granny smith apples
we were astonished at how the food was fresh
there were no crumbs in our baskets afterwards
my saturday was made a little sweeter because of my lunch at press 195
thanks
Fantastic sandwiches
lovely full salads, nicely presented
You could eat here dozens of times and never have the same thing twice
Just a great place
The blue awning doesn't stand out much on 5th Ave among the other restaurants, but it's worth searching for
A friend recommended this place after we had some drinks at Patio Lounge and it was wonderful
The waitress was incredibly friendly and accomodating! The hummus appetizer was so yummy and the sandwich was just as good! I would highly recommend this place
and they deliver
I only wish I lived in Park Slope so I could take advantage of this place more often
this place is perfect for a solo treat with a book, or a relaxing glass of wine and sandwich with a friend
the sandwiches are huge and tasty, and the wines are completely affordable
the service is friendly and a little flirty, but not in your face
i don't like the yellow painted walls, and the lights are a bit too bright
Since Press 195 opened, we go about once a week, and the food and service has only gotten better and better
While the bread is fantastic, I opt for a wrap instead because the bread is too overwhelming and I hate to waste such good eats
The back garden is quiet in the summer and feels like you're just hanging out at a friend's
The staff is very accommodating to any changes requested
Try a grilled veg sandwich with a glass of Buckley's Syrah - divine!
Press 195 has to be one of my favorite places to eat in NYC
The food is fantastic, Ive never ordered something I didnt like
It is also healthy, cheap, convenient, fantastic atmosphere and the staff is super friendly! I would recommend it to anyone! :)
Tasty sandwiches, solid service, eat inside or out; wouldn't go to Brooklyn without stopping by for a quickie
A mix of ordinary ingredients in the most extraordinary way produces sandwiches you will never forget
Fortunately they are numbered so you can keep track of every one -- and eat them all
It will take nearly a year! Fantastic new spot that brings gourmet sandwich fare to Brooklyn
Delicious
Amazing
Fun
To say that the food here is fantastic would simply not do it justice
My choice (the ham, cheddar and tomato sandwich with Dijon mustard) was an excercise in heartbreak, in that every crunchy, savory, mouth-watering bite I took brought me one bite closer to the end
I fully intended to swap half of my sandwich with my boyfriend, so I could taste what he was having, but after the first nibble, there was no way I was giving that baby up
He probably felt the same way, since he never made an offer to share either
I'm looking forward to having my heart broken many more times!
This restaurant is great for kids during the day and can be very romantic for two at night
You can enjoy the indoor seating, or find a quite corner in the back garden area
Wherever you sit the food and wine will be one of the best tastes you've ever had
Stop by anytime Tuesday to Sunday and enjoy
It's a wonderful location, classy but not pretentious
I felt very at home and relaxed
The atmosphere was welcoming of whatever you wanted to do there
sit and talk, dance, relax, chill out
I will be there again soon!
The place turns into a lounge on wednesdays and saturdays
After a great dinner, we stayed there on a wednesday and were pretty surprised to see this live Moroccan band performing all night with cute Ella belly dancer and a second band called gnawa, a moroccan trance band
A must see, everybody is nice and friendly and when you go you will have a big surprise after the band starts
so thank you guys for making that night rememberalble
A very surprising experience
Dinner was extremely good
Staff was friendly
Was in on a Thursday and found out that they had music and a nice crowd
A cool place to lounge and have a few drinks without the whole scene, yet it was incredibly hip
They told me Fridays were also good
Going to meet a few friends and see how it is
Although I'm pretty sure that I won't be dissapointed
What a nice surprise !!! Found by chance one evening, I went in with a couple of friends and had one of the best Cous-Cous in NY
Went back for lunch and had great Chicken Fajitas
tried brunch and the Eggs Benedict were the best I've ever had
Weak points? Pasta dishes can be improved and the wine list
well let's say it's a work in progress
Super friendly owner and service, I also heard the bar has a few hip-hop nights that are pretty jamming
Worth checking it out
stumbled in the other night without knowing what to expect and had a surprisingly good time
found a fun, down to earth crowd, clean, airy atmosphere
the bartenders were awesome- generous, friendly and made delicious, strong drinks
a dj set up later kickin great beats the rest of the night

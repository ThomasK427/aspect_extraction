Good
no, great food, pleasant decor and good service
From the bread assortment with the flavored butter to a great magarita, the food is mouthwatering with generous portions
The menu is flawless
(No, I haven't been paid to write this review)
The pizza is comparable to Grimaldi's (all fresh ingredients), and the chicken dishes are to die for
Check out the chicken breast topped w/fresh proscioutto or mozeralla chesse wrapped in bacon with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach ($18) it's enough for two diners
Need I say more
My boyfriend and I have declared Ruddy and Dean's Our Spot
Our meals have always been the BEST - excellent service! Get the fried calamari - trust me
Everything is well timed for the perfect meal
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years, now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza
Hanx
Short on Time New Year's eve, got a reservation for me and my family of 4
Great food atmosphere and pricing
Ask for Marshall as your waiter, great accent and voice
Entertaining and great fun
This pizza is one of the best on Staten Island
From the first bite, right down to the last
Anyway you slice it, with whatever toppings
Their pizza is the best
This is the best Pizza you could ever imagine with fresh ingredients and a nice crispy crust
The staff is friendly and you feel like part of the family when you go there
I now live in Virginia but still go there to get pizaa
Its true!
definitly the best pizza on the island
vodka pizza is awesome and calamari was good too!
Like no other pizza is Goodfella's Brick Oven
I remember when they opened in the mid 90's here at this first Staten Island location, I did want to go simply because of the obvious mafioso connotation within the name of the restaurant
Once I tasted the food, I was their biggest fan
Goodfella's made me try things I would have never considered tasting, simply because whatever they make is delicious
Goodfella's continuity has earned my loyalty
For $8
99 you would be better off probably ordering from the menu instead of the all you can eat lunch buffet
I didn't enjoy the food at all so I wouldn't take a chance and order from the menu
The food was not hot (temperature) and everything tasted old like it was from the day before
I know real Indian food and this wasn't it
I find Abu's bakery one of the best bakery around brooklyn the taste and the creation are one of a kind
I personaly recommended this bakery over others because just the simple fact that I always ordered cakes from this bakery from every and each one of the member of my family birthdays
Very pleasent-spacious, great service, great food, good value
It felt very cozy
Excellent place
excellent food for very very decent price
Great place to hang out with friends, for drinks, and the Fried ice-creams were the best around
just lovely
mmMmMmMmmm MmMmmMm Great!!!!
This food is decent, but it's a shame that when you order delivery you almost always get the wrong order! I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice
We will only go there and eat in, where the service is decent and it's BYO, never order delivery!
Gald my friend discovered this little Sushi place
I reccomend the Sushi buffet, for like $18 it's pretty good
The presentation is nice (they don't just throw the food at you)
It's not over stuffed with rice BECAUSE it's a buffet
And they don't only have the cheaper choices for the buffet
like plain old california rolls
This is a great hole-in-the-wall type place for authentic tacos, huaraches (kind of like a tostada), and, best of all, tortas (mexican subs)
Everything is very cheap
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions
The people are very friendly and the joint can be very relaxing once you get over the no frills atmosphere
Truly the worst barbeque that I've ever had
Pulled chicken was boiled and bland
Nothing we ordered had any flavor
Sides were mediocre at best and biscuits were inedible
Simply awful
I love the ribs, they have the best sauce, the corn muffin and the mash, yum
My husband loves the southern fried chicken
We order every now and then, and it's great every time
We highly recommend Jakes
Our family does a lot of takeout and when we treat ourselves to Jake's it's really an event
Not often because it's super rich and the portions are large
The barbeque is great, but my personal favorites are the *fried catfish nuggets* and the *sauteed rice and black eyed peas*
So, so good
I highly recommend
I love BBQ, my friends and I try different BBQ spots throughout New York City
Hanging out in this section of Brooklyn, a hot new developing community, we stopped in Jake's
The burgers were thick juicy with noticeably excellent beef quality, plus a wonderful sauce, the pork chops were tender and slightly grilled, the broiled salmon like the chops was excellent
We plan on coming back to this little hot spot
ps - The decor is contemp/modern, the walls are adorn with original oversize photos of country scenes, talking with the owner, I learned he did the photography
The ribs were very mediocre, too cloyingly sweet sauced, the cheese fries were one solid mass of cheese and the 2 juicy thick pork chops were hockey pucks  This place stinks
Dine elsewhere
These people are clueless
The owner has taken over three dining tables for her computer, adding machine, phone and assorted and untidy papers
We received the vegetable side dishes first- the mixed hot veggies, the cole slaw, the baked beans
10 minutes later we got the potato skins
10 minutes after that we got our main courses
The half ribs were tasteless but with a good sauce it could have been saved
The broiled filet of sole was like filet of shoe sole
An embarrassment
too much food for some, is great value for others
There is a lot of food, but it's some of the best BBQ found in Brooklyn
The restaurant itself is nothing charming, but these guys do most of their biz for deliveries, which is how I usually get it, and often
Tooooo much food, dinner for 2 was nearly 6 meals after we took out what we didn't eat! BBQ was good but the sauce was just ok
This place is a great value spot but for BBQ experts go somewhere else
I had walked past this place a number of times and hadn't gone in until recently
Wish I had, perhaps the best Chinese food in Brooklyn Heights, as well as the cheapest
Good dumplings and noodle dishes
My wife and I love ordering from Lichee Nut
The delivery is instant
We like our food spicy and Lichee Nut scores on that scale bigtime
The Fire Fighter Shredded Beef or Chicken is searing and the Schezuan veggie dumplings are spicy peanuty
Great! Eating there is kind of low end

I came back the following two nights for drinks with a new cast of characters
This place is the real deal
If you give the folks at Baldoria a chance, theyll make your night out in New York a special event
I had been here before for the Insalata di Mare and the delicious Veal Scaloppini
Again I was delighted from start to finish
We also had a great bellini at the bar beforehand and sat downstairs in a booth
The waitstaff was very prompt and attentive and the food was perfect
We had the Insalata di Mare, veal and a ceasar salad, wine and coffee/espresso
The bread was nothing terrific but I didn't want to fill up on it anyway! The bill was $110 for 2 which I think was very reasonable for the food and service and total experience
I would go back again! Great for the theatre district too
We saw a birthday group with older kids (so ok for groups kids) made reservations at Open Table
I ate there for the first time tonight
I took my girlfriend to see a show on Broeadway at 3PM, and I wanted to take her out to dinner afterwards
The positive reviews are on the money
The place is causal, yet refined, the service was excellent, and the food is flavorful and well prepared
Although we normally shy away from them, we both had the $35 prefixed menu items, and are more than happy that we did
We met a nice couple from Pittsburg who were seated next to us that highly recommended their meatballs, which we tried and loved
In short, great place, reasonable prices, and make sure you buy a jar of Rao's sauce on your way out
Three visits and every one has been a joy
Ive gone with two good friends on guys night out
Ive entertained a party of 10 for my wifes birthday
And weve taken out-of-towners here
On every visit the food has been consistently spectacular, and that means everything from Caesar salad to cheesecake has been great
A lowly eggplant parmigiana was transformed to into something heavenly
The pastas have been wonderful, the lemon chicken awesome, the liver, too was done to perfection
And the staff, starting with owner Frank Pellegrino on down, has been warm and attentive
Its amazing how certain restaurants that dont get onto the hot lists end up being even better experiences than the ones everyones raving about
We love this place
Since you can NEVER get into Rao's, his son does a pretty good job here at Baldoria! The place is fun, too! The upstairs on weekend has a piano player and a singer
The night we were there the singr had a voice like Etta! We were very pleased with the food
Very flavorful
We also enjoyed the raw bar upstairs before dinner
The staff sometimes tries to rush rush, that is why we order the appetizers first, then after we finish them we order dinner
Otherwise you will be in and out in 40 minutes! Other than that, great Italian restaurant to try!
Baldoria's has a nice upscale yet casual atomosphere for an Italian restaurant and reminds you of an old world mobster/mafia place that are shown in movies (you have to see it to completely understand)
The food was very good and I would highly recommend saving room for the famous tiramisu for dessert
After the meal, the manager invited us to stay around and listen to their live music which was very enjoyable
The price might be a little high for some but I would recommend others to try this spot
The location is not far from the Broadway Theaters and Times Square
Party of nine meeting for dinner before heading off to three different theatres
Friendly wait staff and reasonable table placement (you weren't seated on top of the next table-New York style)
Great variety at the raw bar (taste battle of the east coast oyster vs
the west coast oyster)
Entrees were fresh and flavorfull
I fancied the veal with lemon and capers, others enjoyed several of the pasta choices, and the filet mignon special of the evening
As we exchanged tastes, we discovered that all of the entrees were delicious
This restaurant is mostly about location in the heart of the Theatre District, but don't under estimate the food
Wine list was a little pricey but by the second bottle everyone agreed that it was worth it
We ate here last week
My family had flown in, and I had to figure out a place that was near the theatre district, and had good Italian food
Well we have been to Carmine's so many times, that this place seemed like a logical choice instead
We were so pleased
It was an incredibly tasty meal, and the service staff was the best
The meatballs were incredible! I can't wait to go back
Great for an intimate dinner, but even better for a big family sort of event
We went there for a pre-theatre dinner and the food was top notch
The service was also extremely good
The lobster cocktail was awesome, the rizotto w/ shrimp was well done, and the streak was above average
I would definitely go back
We had a party of 5, and everyone enjoyed their meals and the service much more than average
It wasn't the best Italian I've had, but it was all right
The service was good
The atmosphere was great
But, I've been there done that now
Called late in the day for dinner and got them the same nite (8pm)
Fabulous food - ordered the Fusilli with fennel-less sausage cabbage
Wife had the tomato-infused ravioli stuffed with crab
Sat upstairs - happy waiter, quick attentive service
Wonderful people watching place
Can't wait to go back!! Was absolutely the best Italian restaurant experience we've ever had (20+ years of restaurant hopping at 2-3x/week)
Well you know you're in trouble in an Italian Restaurant when the Caesar Salad and Caprese Salad are the special appetizers
the resulting meal consisted of bottled salad dressing; boxed pasta; overcooked sausages; canned chicken stock; veal scallopine with no side dishes offered
The service was appalling
Even the Olive Garden is better than this
My husband I ate at Baldoria pre-theater we both found the food to be very good albeit a bit pricey
The osso buco was quite good the risotto primavera was excellent,but the grilled octopus appie was like eating butter
Delish!!!Service was good -- waiters were around all the time
When we entered (6:00) the place was empty when we left, it was full
I still contend that Il Mulino is #1 if you can ignore the surly attitudes of the waiters,however, Baldoria was NOT a disappointment
I ate here a couple of months ago for pre-theater
It was great and the service was outstanding
The desserts need some help though
We all know that this is the son of the Impossable to get in Rao's resturant
and has to live with the constant critics calling this Rao's JR
But I tell you this place can not only stand on it's two feet but also hang with the big boys
The Chicken and Salmon were perfect
the best baked clams I've ever had
anyone who rates this place below an 8 is a moron
(go back to your egg noodles and ketsup) I've been to the best Italian places many times Il Mulino's, Il Gilio, Il Buco, Ecco etc
and this place still impressed me
Now I just have to wait for one of my Rao's connections to come through to check that place out
In Short Martini drinkers and steak lovers converge on this 480-seat restaurant spread across three floors of the McGraw-Hill Building
The menu offers a lineup of USDA prime steaks at higher-end prices paired with sides such as crab cakes, fried oysters and onion rings
Four separate areas are available for private parties, ranging from the mezzanine "Newsroom" with a $2,000 food-beverage minimum to the wine cellar which can accommodate up to 75 guests
Came here with a client, and we all ended up ordering the business lunch, which was a 6oz fillet with mashed potatoes, starter salad, and dessert
Good deal, amazing steak dessert
visiting New York i had a t bone steak, was tuff, sides tasteless only the wine was good  i was in Las Vegas 2 weeks ago the food was so much better
One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Manhattan
This place is special
Anything you order will be amazing

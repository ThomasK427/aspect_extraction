Everything I have ever ordered from Kolonaki has been amazing
It is a great place to hang out in the evening with coffee and dessert or to take home
I highly suggest the tiramisu!
Best
Pizza
EVER
Fresh mozzarella
Incredible sauce
Thin, crispy crust for the regular slices, and the best sicilian slice I've ever had
I feel bad for anyone who hasn't had Sac's pizza cause they haven't truly lived
this place is worth a trip
beautiful pie
coal oven
chewy/crisp crust
Without a doubt the best pizza in NYC
Cold beer and pizza so what could be better
My gf recently moved to Astoria and by chance-moving day we decided to order some pizza from Sac's
Ever since then-I haven't been wanting to get pizza anywhere else
Has one of the best tasting Sicilian slices I've ever had, and the regular slices have the perfect blend of fresh mozarella and tasty sauce which isn't slobbed on
Chicken rolls are also really good-- tastes very similar to homemade chicken cutlet
Yes-I did notice a bit of an attitude with the guys up front--but seems like the regular I hate working and serving people all day type of thing
Not a big deal
A great find! Not many people do this but I recommend getting a Sicilian slice and asking for Ricotta cheese on top
tastes soo good
=P
This is REAL New York Pizza! Born and raised eating pizza in NYC and it dont get better than this! try it you will love it!!
Pizza to die for???? Well darn close! Thin crisp crust the correct amount of good quail
cheese and sauce make a balanced pie
Head pizza maker Luis has the ability to teach pie making
It does not matter who is at the oven its the same great balanced taste
Cold Beer in the box ,Snapple ' Botique Rootbeer soda also
Want glasswine with your slice,just pop over to the fullservice side and they will pour from the 8 or so Redssome organics
Try not to step on the Wineturtle he is always lurking about
Sac's Pizza has the best pizza in New York City or Long Island
I've eaten at every other top rated location, and they trail Sac's in terms of taste and quality
His Sicilian, Napolitano and Spinach Pizza are as good as it gets
This is the best Italian food I have ever had
If available, I highly recommend the lasagna and of course their pizza
I love this place! The service, food, price and ambiance are terrific
This place has the best pizza in New York, let alone the United States
Patsy's has nothing on Sac's
The first time I ate there, I thought I had discovered Pizza Heaven
The crust is thin and chewy, the sauce is spicy and they use fresh mozzerala
They don't load their pizza down with tons of cheese nor is it dripping with sauce
Every single piece has that perfect balance of cheese and sauce
I convinced a friend of mine to make the trip to Queens and she raved about how this is best pizza she's had since she's returned from Italy
You must go
You will love it
Sacs Pizza Is the greatist place to eat in the whole city if you want great itallian food go to Sacs
If you go tell them Vinny and Conrad sent you
We recently discovered this place while searching for a pizza joint in the area
What a surprise! I had the pasta special, which had tremendous amount of seafood
The price was awesome
I would also recommend the garlic bread for a starter
The girl working there is very friendly and nicest
The area may not be the friendliest, but dont miss this place
*Update: REcently the quality of food is not so great anymore
Maybe too many customers? Kinda get a feeling to push out of the door sometimes
And Food needs to be cooked more
Very sad, since we thought we found a great place
Hope they will improve
For now we will not go back
BTW, does anyone know who painted that wall???
I lived down the street from Napoli for 2 years and picked up dinner here more often than any other restaurant in Astoria
The pasta, chicken and veal dishes are one of the best values in town, almost always served with bread and salad (and pasta for the meat dishes)
The pizza is only slightly above the avarage slice shop, but also a reasonable deal
Sit down service, while pleasant and speedy, leaves something to be desired
The atmosphere is kind of cheap and a tad dingy - definitely not a date spot
Overall a decent place, but you'll get the most out of it if you live as close as i did and pick up or have them deliver
My boyfriend and I went to Napoli's last Friday to grab a quick bite before our movie (Napoli's is just 3 blocks from Kaufman Astoria theaters)
Interesting crowd for people watching - old school Italian music cranking - friendly Italian waitress brought us our wine garlic bread in no time
We ordered big plates of pasta (very generous portions) and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly
Our bill cost less than our movie tickets, and we're going back again this Friday with friends
provides the best italian food in town
the pasta dishes are great and also his chili is marvellous
so if you want to eat great real italian food, tasty is the right choice
This is one of the best places in Astoria
The food is great, freshly prepared and not expensive
The place is spotlessly clean
The service is quick,friendly and polite
I like the atmosphere here
Busy, full of locals and families
You can watch your food and pizza being made
Try the chicken souvlaki, best i ever had
Delivery is fast too
They treat you like family when you come in
the pizza is also great
The service was horrific
We walked in and no one even looked at us
We didn't know whether to seat ourselves or wait to be seated
After standing for a few minutes, we seat ourselves
No one came around to give us menus so I went to get a couple
15 minutes, a lady comes over and wants to take our order
It takes about 45 minutes to get our food (their special) and the couple that ordered 20 minutes after us got their food before us
AND, the food was way too salty
DO NOT GO WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE
I live right down the street from Romanos, and I cannot speak more highly of their pizza
They cook the cheese so that it turns a nice brown color and it is absolutely the best pizza I've ever had in New York
The only thing is that they don't exactly smile and welcome you when you come in the door
You have to go right up to the desk and tell them exactly what you want

The food was just as good as it was in Italy, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting
We loved our dining experience, and will definitely recommend it to others
One word of caution though
ask your waiter for the price of the specials
They are much more expensive than the items on the regular menu!
Very dissapointing
After the grilled calamari, we got onion soup that had no soup, a dish of beans that had no flavor, the kitchen didn't make one of the three pasta dishes ordered, and the pork chop and other main dishes were not very good
The fish was tasteless and the veal was an appetizer serving
Go to Carmines
Waiter never refilled a water glass, didn't offer spoons, pepper or cheese for the pasta or any of the entrees
Chef Cesare Casella's food takes me back to Tuscany without paying for the air fare!  His warm salad with eggs is something I could just eat nonstop! Every dish he brought to our table was better than the last
For true Italian ambiance, try Beppe!
The food here is yummy - and after having been to Tuscany quite a few times I can say it's authentic too
The ribollita soup is amazing - so thick you can stand a fork in it
If you like steak, the Tuscan steak w/fries for two is terrific
Make sure to get there a bit early and try a tuscan lemonade at the bar


or a raspberry cosmo!
I ate at Beppe last weekend and though the service was fine -- in fact I was pleased that it was low-key and friendly, rather than toadying and obsequious
The waiter was very responsive and recommended a good wine
The food was very tasty, but perhaps too heavy
The ambience was less overtly romantic than I might have expected
I love this place! The fries are unbelievable, as is the pasta and shrimp
The people are all extremely friendly, especially the bartenders
The Scene A bamboo dividing screen, Chinese calligraphy, and paper lanterns, as well as low red lighting, dark wood veneers and loud music, create the ideal ambience for flirtatious groups and first dates
Seats are easy to come by early in the evening, but Chow Bar fills up fast with a mix of locals and curious tourists
The Food The menu is better suited to the snacking at the long bar than dining in the compact dining area
Ginger chicken is perfectly complemented by chewy peanuts and chili peppers; wok-roasted baby clams come bathed in a flavorful sake, scallion and cilantro sauce
But more filling dishes, like lobster noodles in an overly thick coconut sauce and an uninspired roast duck, are less satisfying
Short ribs and Szechuan steak are tasty but just a spice or two removed from their Western counterparts
Went to Chow Bar for dinner, I thought it was kind of pricey, but the food and the service was good - but it wasn't incredibly busy, so maybe they just had more free time to devote to us
Lychee martinis are yummy, the chocolate wonton dessert special was really good
We had tuna tartar for an app - make sure you ask for extra crackers - and the king crab legs, cooked very well
I'd go back, but would try other places first probably
My boyfriend and I go here about once a month
I love the place!! The bathroom is always clean and the food is awesome if you pick out the right Entree
Dessert is just amazing
Chow Bar has never failed to leave me smiling and really really full
Recommended dishes: Teryaki Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Spring Rolls, and of course any of the desserts
The place had a fun look and ambiance to it
However, the food spanned the range from good to bad
Not exactly cheap and not that great, once is more than enough for me
Appetizers: Special tuna tartar was really bad
Ribs were definitely good
Dumplings were only ok
Fried rice, bad
Entrees: Steak frites was really really good
Duck was so-so
Don't go here! I was at Chow Bar recently for a birthday party
There were 11 people at the table
It took the waiter over a 1/2 hour to come over to tell us the specials
Then he left in the middle of reading them and never came back
20 minutes later he was helping other tables
We had to flag him down just to place our orders
We didn't get our dinners until after we had been sitting at the table for for almost 1
5 hours! When we asked to speak with the manager, he came over with a huge attitude and proceeded to pick a fight
A loud argument ensued, and left the entire party highly embarassed
To top it off, the food wasn't even good
And they added a 20% service charge to our bill, just to spite us
This was the most awful dining experience ever!
i LOVE chow bar! it's the best! the food is super yummy at a great value
the drinks are amazing
service is outstanding
bob and peter are the GREATEST! excellent for groups!! i'll be going back very frequently!!!
Neat spot, good food -interesting selection of updated Chinese classices like spare ribs, rolls, lobster friend rice, chow mein and the likes at a good value
However was somewhat disappointed in recent visits, the food was not as good as the first time
However, still like this crazy, funky place and think it great for groups!
Chow Bar is terrific - great food, great cocktails, solid service and cool, funky (if a little aged) decor
The menu is contemporary asian and the food is competently prepared
Don't miss the rib appetizer
And that tall blond hostess - she defines professionalism
Always a smiling face but never overbearing
Make reservations if you're going after 8 Thurs-Sat
Back room is funky and good for a large party
Hated by many for being uberchic, the Asian fusion food gets a bad rap
The kitchen does a good job of making variations on traditional Chinese dishes, like the duck with scallion pancakes, and adding Asian flavors to Western dishes, such as filet mignon with wasabi mashed potatos
The specialty drinks are excellent
The typical slow West Village service is to be expected, but the staff was very courteous to our large party that arrived late
Seems that every time I go on a date with a guy in my neighborhood, he suggests this place
With so many cooler, better, more intimate, more fun, better tasting places in the W
Village, what's the big whoop about Chow Bar? Food is fine but unremarkable, atmosphere is very noisy, especially for a date, and our waiter looked like he had never seen us before when we reminded him that we had ordered a second round of drinks 20 minutes earlier
Not worth it
V
chi chi
BUT
Out of the 13 dishes that our table of six ordered (a mix of large and small) the food was really sub par
The only good dish was the filet, which was just okay
The chicken, which sounded good on the menu, was nothing short of disgusting, undercooked, and tasteless tibdbits of some part of the chicken I've never seen
The service is condescendingly friendly and waiting for your table, even with a reservation is a must they seem to insist on
Even then the summer roll appetizer, with salmon and papaya, which sounded amazing, was bland except for the coconut dipping sauce
Don't bother with this place - simply go to Chinatown, or, if you must spend a lot of money on Chinese food, go to Mr
Chow's on 57th - food there is MUCH better
Had a nice dinner at Chow, food was very well prepared, and the menu was a bit cheesy (chinatown vegetables seems a bit silly) but the dishes were great
I found the service to be competent but factory-like
The hostess informed our party five times that the coat check costs one dollar per coat or bag
which seemed like a cheap touch in an overall enjoyable evening
I'd go back, but I wish the staff could turn up the charm
Music was a bit loud as well, pity
Good vibe but LOUD

We visited Tribecca Grill for the American Graffitti wine tasting, stayed for dinner
Our meal ($35 pre-fixe) was fine, but our wine service was botched
We ordered a 1991 Shafer Hillside Select Cabernet, and asked that it not be decanted
Unfortunately, our sommelier decided to ignore our request--b/c a couple of pieces of cork had fallen into the wine, and she couldn't figure out how to get them out, other than to decant the entire bottle--which is just ridiculous
Sadly, the wine's nose was gone, and it showed much less powerfully (and less nicely) than the tiny amount in the bottle that wasn't decanted
We didn't get an apology, nor a price concession
$225/bottle is a lot to pay to ignore a customer request and damage their wine
Our Peruvian waiter was very nice, and the food was ok, but forget about ordering an expensive bottle of wine there
went there for restaurant week
had to wait 20 minutes even though we had a reservation
our waiter was great in that he took down our order for all 3 courses once we were seated and everything came out right on time
food overall was good but nothing that i'd go back for
for the prices that are on the regular menu we were expecting something more upscale and less generic
I've been to many restaurants in NYC for restaurant week and Tribeca Grill was a great choice
The food was good quality throughout the 3 courses and the service was impeccable
I will return if I am in the neighborhood and I'm definitely curious about the rest of their menu
I went here during restaurant week and although their restaurant week menu was impressive I saw the Herb Chicken dish and could not resist
It was absolutely phenomenal
One of the best chicken dishes I've ever had! The chicken was tender and fresh with just the right amount of flavor from the herbs and the porcini sauce was delectable
My friend ordered the quaill appetizer which was also excellent and the sea bass- very good
You can't go wrong here and considering that it's categorized as very expensive I really felt like it was cheap for the quality of food we received
If you're a New Yorker and you haven't been here, GO
NOW!!!
Tribeca Grill has extended their restaurant week menu so go while you have the chance! A friend and I had a delightful experience
We made reservations for 8:30pm but were not seated until 9 (so err on the early side when making ressies)
Our waiter was very polite and helpful
My appetizer of endive and bleu cheese salad was a surprisingly large serving which balanced the striped bass entree (served on a bed of vegetables)
My friend had the special soup and her cheese ravioli looked divine (it was garnished with yummy spinach)
Our desserts were the perfect ending - she had a chocolate truffle cheesecake while my warm apple tart was delicious (this coming from someone who is not a fan of apples!)
The atmosphere was casual, the waiters friendly, and the food above average
We will definitely be going back!
We decided to check out Tribeca Grill for Restaurant Week becuase the menu looked pleasantly different
What a mistake! The salad and dessert were sub-par but the entrees were honestly horrible
I ordered the black bass which came out smelling fishy and my friend ordered the shortback ribs which he said tasted like beef jerky
When we asked the waiter what was up he said that they just could not provide it was too costly to provide there usally quality of food and that most people who come to Restaurant Week are from Jersey and won't be repeat customers so it wouldn't really affect their future business
To say the least we will never go back here again
Two nights later I had dinner at another Restaurant Week participant and it was AMAZING!!! I will back and pay the full $65 pre-fix price
Isn't that what Restaurant Week is about?
I have been lucky enough to dine here several times a year
The menu has a nice selection, and everything on it is well prepared and tastie
I have also noticed an improved waitstaff over the last few years, less attitude, better attention, and friendlier staff
It's a great experience
Just visited the Tribeca Grill with a group of 6
Nice place
We were seated in the small back dining room
Would've preferred a table in the larger open area
Food was very good
My filet was dry and overcooked
I ordered Medium-Rare and it was well done
The waiter warned a group member that the filet was dry
and to order the NY STRIP
I should've listened
Other than that
Seared Ahi Tuna was excellent, as was the spinach
Most group members were very happy
Wine list here is huge
Interesting art work on the walls
Overall, a worthwhile establishment
Visited the restaurant on vacation - we were very pleased! Loved the atmosphere - NY, but casual
We ordered from the prix fixe menu ($39 for three courses) and loved every bite
Blue Cheese and Endive Salad, Goat Cheese Ravioli was to die for, and the absolute BEST cheesecake that we had ever tasted
Super wine list can accommodate anyone - with help, we chose a very low priced bottle - $40 (which still was highly recommended from the staff) which was wonderful
For more discerning wine drinkers, bottles go up to $2,250! I would definitely go back, and recommend it to anyone looking for a superb meal out
I was very disappointed in the food and atmosphere
My sister ordered the duck the sauce was so bad that it took away the taste in the duck so my sister had to scrape the sauce off the duck,so she could eat it, i was also shocked that the food on your plate was so little and so expensive i was hungrey the next two hours,also the dessert menue was such confusion to read i dont care how fancy it was how do you not have cheese cake! also the seats were to close together i felt cramped
How ever the service was quick the wine was good
Went here for a romantic birthday dinner
Was surprised at how casual the atmosphere was
Our waitress happened to be a space cadet and cared more about attending to the loud mouth drunks across from us
The food was nice but not amazing
The scallops were good but a little over seared and not the buttery consistency I was hoping for
My fiance had the beef filet which was quite good but again, nothing fantastic
If you are into having dinner with a room of obnoxious, stuffy khakis then this is the spot for you
I dined there during the tennis us open this week with a large group of friends
We had a great experience
Awesome atmosphere, wonderful food priced well and on top of it we saw and met one of the tennis players while he was dining there
We had a great time, will definitely go back
I hadn't eaten at the Tribeca Grill recently but was impressed wit the excellent food and attentive waitstaff
Highly trained servers made great wine recommendations
Highly recommend
Menu had a variety of selections, the waitstaff was excellent, wine selection is great and the food was very flavorful
Very nice upscale casual dining experience
I highly recommend!
I came to the grill with high hopes
while I was not supremely disappointed, it certainly didn't hit it out of the park
The apps were outstanding, but my pasta, which was recommended by the waitstaff, was sub par
Good service though, and an excellent somellier
I love Deniro, but he could do a little better
I came here for restaurant week (RW) not expecting that much (food, value and service tends to be mediocre at best with respect to the RW menu at RW participating restaurants!)
However, I was pleasantly surprised that at least one item on the RW menu that was also on the main menu
thank you, Tribeca Grill, for being a hi-profile place in step with the spirit of RW, namely to use RW as a showcase to cultivate new customers
I've been increasingly disappointed with RW (excepting a few places)
Tribeca Grill is a place I will definitely want to stop by b/c I can't wait to try out their full priced menu which has foie gras!
Very enjoyable atmosphere
great service
scallops to die for
yummy cobbler for desert
Can't go wrong with wine selection and informative wait staff to assist
tables are pretty close together not leaving lots of room for comfort
and $8 for a small plate of lettuce is crazy

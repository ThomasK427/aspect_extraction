The food, however, is a delight
And the view is marvelous
For our May mother and daughter outing we went to Tavern on the Green for lunch
The decor is eclectic and a bit gaudy but unique in it's own way
We sat by the window overlooking Central Park which was nice
We ordered crab cakes, caesar salad and the cedar planked salmon and everything was wonderfully prepared and the portions were generour
The only fly in the ointment was the service
Our food was delivered in a timely fashion but if you wanted another drink or your check you had to hunt down your server
Since we only do the mother, daughter outing once a year, the $120
00 check (including tip, no alcohol just soft drinks) was not unexpected but still pricey for lunch
I recently stopped by with 5 friends for a drink on a Thursday afternoon
None of my friends had been to NY so this was going to be a fun treat to be having drinks at the famous Tavern on the Green
Our server was so obnoxious and rude that we left after our first drink
After she finally took our order and brought the drinks, she slammed each one on the table then never came back to check on us or bring our check
We just left cash on the table and walked out
Needless to say, this server tarnished this restaurant's reputation and we will never be back!
My daughter and I were in NY for a hustle bustle weekend of shopping and shows but when you arrive at Tavern on the Green, you have stepped into another world of tranquility and calmness
Even though the crystal room is magnificent, to me on my previous visit and this return visit, sitting outside and having cocktails and then dinner is a must
I had soft shell crabs and they were ecellent
The service was very attentive and helpful too
If we didn't have tickets to the theatre, I am sure we would have been there for many more hours as we didn't want to leave
It is the whole experience of relaxation on a warm, beautiful night in Central Park that is a must and a memory that you will remember for a lifetime!
This is one of the worst places Ive ever been to
How to be brief about this? The food was awful and way overpriced
Both my husband and I just ended up picking around on our plates and eating maybe a third of our plates
The place is absolutely gaudy and in dire need of needing to be redone
The furniture was shabby as in the paint was wearing off the chairs and the walls and the decoration horrible
OK, some of the stained glass was exceptional
The wait staff was rude and never checked on us after the food came, maybe it was because we reserved through Expedia and they were afraid to loose out on their tip since wed paid ahead
Forget the beautiful chandeliers, the dark green and ruby red will make you ill especially since the ceiling was painted in pastel colors
My friends and I went here for Summer restaurant week, and we found that the food is hit or miss here
We all ordered diffferent dishes, and we found that the brushetta is awesome, bisque salty and tasteless, salmon delicious, and pasta forgettable
The dessert got uniform raves though, especially the decadent chocolate
Decor is interesting though kitsch, and waiter polite but captain snobby
I'd come if you just want fun atmosphere, but not for the food alone, especially for this price
went with a bunch of people from work to one of Tavern's garden nights -we got a bunch of comp passes from a nightclub promoter
Was so much fun! As a NYer, have heard lots about Tavern, but I never would have thought it would have been such a fun place catering to a younger crowd
I guess these special nightly promotions only happen in the summertime, but I would definately go back again - either fro drinks or for a meal
Wr all split a bunc hof appetizers n desserts in the cocktail section of the garden - very nice choices and I was very happy with the desert especially!
Over RATED! The food was pretty good but over priced!!! The waiter was horrible
service was the worse
This was the last meal we had after a 4 day stay in NYC
Everywhere else we had outstanding service but that all changed with this place
TO BAD
it is a very pretty restuarant :O(
One of my worst dining experiences
The food was diner-quality and overpriced, and service was despicable
The Crystal Ballroom was closed for a private party, so we couldn't even enjoy the decor
I was very disappointed when I went for lunch with some Londoners
The waitress was very discourteous and the food was just ok
It's a great location and the rooms are very pretty, but it leaves a lot to be desired
I do not recommend rushing to this place any time soon
i vist Tavern on the green every year a couple of times during the summer
ITs the best time of year to come- the place is still packed
But the garden is a must-see! Worth the wait and the crowds! Dinner on a weekend night or the music/bar scene on a Thursday night provides a different crowd than the crowds of touists the winter/holdiay season bring
More contemporary, cool music and good scene
I came once for a business lunch and it was a totally different crowd- Reccommed coming after dark
I WENT TO THE TAVERN FOR A WEDDING, AND THE ROOM WHERE THE CEREMONY WAS HELD WAS GORGEOUS
BREATHTAKING EVEN, BUT THE DECOR OVERALL IN THIS PLACE IS SCARY
THE CARPET IS SOOOOO OLD AND GROSS, AND THE WHOLE PLACE IS JUST VERY GAUDY LOOKING WITH THE CHEESY CHANDELIERS AND UGLY WALL PAPER
THE FOOD WAS AVERAGE
I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR A WEDDING, BUT THE CREME BRULEE WAS MAGNIFICENT
I was expecting so much more from this place
The only positive ill give it is the outside courtyard area is beautiful
A dining experience here is like that on a bad cruise ship
You are seated in a large and loud room, hardly room to move, the waiter had no personality and never once checked back with us after he took our order except to deliver the check
The food lacks any sort of tatse, very bland
The Seafood Fettuccine tasted like something out of the Olive Garden, and the halibut had absolutely no taste at all
For the money you pay at this place, the food needs to be improved
This place overall is a bad dining experience, its a tourist trap, save your money and go somewhere that you can actually taste the food
I took my wife to Tavern on the Green during a theatre weekend getaway
I ordered the $39 filet and ordered it medium and it came to the table well done and tasted like a goodyear tire
The waiter was this slovakian guy who came to the table and said what do you want
He came to the table 3 times throughout the meal: first to take our order, second when he brought the food and third when we paid
If you order a coke, be prepared for the $4 price tag, and also be warned that you will not get a refill
This was the one low point of the vacation
Go to one of the many good restaurants in NYC
The atmosphere is like a cabin with Christmas lights everywhere
It is the most gaudy place I have ever been and it reminded me of the Grizwalds
We did the Tavern on a prix fix menue option prior to a broadway show
Seated soon after arival
Food was excellent
Lobster bisque was rich creamy; Prime rib was a very LARGE cut done to perfection; Pasta was excellent an extremely large serving
Cheesecake can't be beat!!  Excellent, polite attentive service
Liquor drinks are expensive (appox
$10ea
); but mixed strong perfect
Beer average price $4-7
But it is NY
The only negative; was that a 20% gratuity was automatically added to the bill for 2 people; usually one is not added for parties under 6 people
Not sure if this is on every check or just w/ prix fix
Other than that we would reccommend this place for food, atmosphere, location service
Would definitely do again
Our daughters talked us into going to the Tavern on the Green even after reading the negative reviews
We were pleasently surprised with a delightful lunch
The three course lunch did not break the bank and the portions were large
The lobster bisque was superb and the lamb shank was tender and tasty
The wait staff was very attentive without being overbearing
There was a communication error in our order (probably our fault) but they made it right plus gave our daughter free dessert
If we ever get back to NYC we will be making reservations again

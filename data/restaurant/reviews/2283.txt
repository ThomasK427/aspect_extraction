He demonstrates serene simplicity with combinations like meaty John Dory riding a swell of sweet pepper ragout; perfectly seared sea scallops with truffled mashed potatoes; and golden North Atlantic cod with couscous and orange lentils, energized by a puddle of Chinese fermented black bean sauce
Side dishes are a la carte but terrific, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better clam chowder in town
Another Restaurant Associates success! Great staff, excellent food, nice ambience
Chef Brown is a great, too
Every course was delicious, and when our entrees were slow in coming they brought shrimp to hold us over - compliments of the chef
That's the kind of service that makes a restaurant fine dining
The food is magnificent, even during restaurant week
We checked out coats and were seated immediately
Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about the specials and service was prompt
We were not rushed through dinner
Great dining experience overall
Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was great
The restaurant was quietly decorated and clean
All the employees were polite and pleasant
We were seated immediately and were able to watch the ice skating in Rockefeller Plaza during our meal
A little pricey but worth it
We didn't leave hungry
Went here for Valentine's Dayits the best dinner I've had in a long time
Arrived early for our reserv
but waiting at the bar was very pleasant
They had excellent pinot grigio and cocktails
The staff was friendly seated us at approx
the exact time we made the reservation for
All the optionson the prix fixe menu sounded amazing
We had the sushi/sashimi combination and the scallops with truffle for appatizers, the artic char crab cakes for entree and the chocolate fondu for two (heavenly) for dessert
The little extras were a nice touch from Valentine's petit fours to the small bag of chocolate and popcorn they gave out to the ladies
I highly recommend going here (let go of all your tourist inhabitions
I did and it was well worth it) but be sure to save up a little extra the week before to cover the bill!
I took a client to dinner at the Sea grill and we had an amazing experience
The food was excellent and well presented
The portions were quite small and the prices were not, but quality rarely comes at a cheap price
There were a number of reasonably priced wine selections
The wait staff was very attentive but a bit obtrusive at times
Overall, however, I very much enjoyed the experience and can't wait to return
Not the best crabcakes
Meal was average
This would probably be a fantastic place during Christmas because of the location on the view
My husband and I decided to get married after dining at the Sea Grill, though not as a direct result of the meal (ha)
The seafood is exceptional (I always get the crab cakes), the service impeccable, and the decor is beautiful, and not just because of the gorgeous view of the ice skating rink
It will always be our special occasion restaurant, especially with the prices
The food was absolutely fantastic
I had the crab cakes and my husband the pork chops
So far, they're the best crab cakes I've had in any restaurant
The wine is a little overpriced, but good nontheless, and they give you a fair amount per glass
The service was very good, but while there were other tables available, we were seated right at the front where everyone comes in, which isn't the most desirable spot in any restaurant
The space between/around tables were also a bit cramped
I love the decor and the presentation is very attractive
The food is good, but for the prices they charge, the food should be better than this
Recommended is any of the fresh fish; the risotto that I tried, however, was average at best
If you like seafood and have a few extra bucks in your pocket, then you have to try the Sea Grill!! I have been to this restaurant twice and have had wonderful meals and great service both times
Make sure to request a rink side table!
Just went there for restaurant week
Menu was fairly limited in terms of choices but the selections were good
Everything we ate tasted very unique and well done
I loved the crunchy salmon as it was perfectly cooked and not overly tasty
The view of the rink is awesome
A GREAT date place
if you can afford it
Delightfully in every way
Exceptional service and the food presentation was over the top
really good
my favorite! and ask for a seat overlooking the ice skating rink
it's a very pretty restaurant and great fish
i recomend it for a special occasion or a date
The Sea Grill is an excellent sea food restaurant
They have a large selection of sea food that you can order al carte that is served over ice
Extremely delious
Everyone that I dined with was very happy with the entire meal
One wall of the restaurant is a large glass window which is level with the ice skating rink at Rockefellar center
For the atmosphere, this is a great place to come during the winter months while people are skating
During the holidays a reservation is a must
This is a great place to come for a special occassion
It is expensive (one of the chefs told me they average about $150 a head)
If you do not eat sea food, it is not worth it for you to eat here
There are only two non-fish choices for entrees
I am a bit skeptical about going to 'touristy' places, but I have to admit, Sea Grill is a great place to dine
It makes you appreciate New York
The restaurant is below street level and just about every table faces the well-known ice skating rink in Rockefeller Center
Obviously I would not come here during the holiday season although I would imagine it to be nicer then with all the holiday decorations
For a 'touristy' place, the food was excellent as was the service
The chef is very creative
If you have family or friends visiting the city and want to impress them, this is a great place
Your wallet will be empty for a week though
In my book, The Sea Grill ranks as one of the top sea food restaurants in the city
The food is extraordinarily fresh and not over-prepared
While the location is not great (at Rock Center), the crowd is sophisticatd, not over touristy
The Sea Grill is a decent seafood restaurant right in Rockefeller Center
While there are better places to get your fill of fish, this place offers a unique combination of scenery (the ice skating rink), ambiance and quality to satisfy many
Big negatives: this place is always very crowded, and many of the tables are quite close together
In addition, you have to endure the rush of the Rock Center basement to get to the restaurant
If you want good seafood, this is NOT the place to go, you'll have better luck at Aqua Grille or Esca
This place was overcrowded, overpriced, and the kitchen was all out of several of the only decent sounding items on the menu
The mediocre salmon tartare wouldn't make up for all that was sub-par
Second experience, second disappointment
If you want to start your night with a tater-tot hors d'oeuvre, and/or have a hangar steak that still had marks where the jockey was hitting it, then this is your place- Much better luck elsewhere
Good location, but tourist-y and poor quality food
My friend and I went to the Sea Grill on a balmy summer evening before heading to the theater
Our outdoor seats were perfect
close enough to enjoy the bustling NYC crowds but somehow also quiet enough for us to enjoy our conversation
The service was, quite simply, perfect

The food was so good
The service was great
On a Friday night at 8 o'clock we waited less than 20 minutes
service is that quick
And with just about every sip of wine we were replenished with more! Since we were first timers we both ordered side dishes
big mistake
The portions are huge
We ended up taking home more than half of what we ordered
Got more than 4 meals worth of great food for less than $40
I will be back regularly
Frank Rules
My friends and I have been going here since we were 15, and it's still just awesome
The food never disappoints, the magic wine never disappoints, and the bill absolutely never disappoints
Where else in NYC can you feel full and drunk for 8-10 dollars for a group of 4? We've given Frank Christmas cards, he's given us free bottles of wine (not the box wine!) to take to a friend's birthday party, he's just one class act
Do yourself a favor, and pay him a visit
Be nice and tip well
Our last visit, the owner of the restaurant not only notice (among the crazy busy place) that our table was missing a spoon, but also that our table was wobbly
and fixed it without being asked
I've been here dozens of times and never disappointed
Free wine, fast service, good food, crazy atmosphere
if you're looking for a fun, cheap evening, this is it
If you are looking for a pretentious evening of lobster and martini's, go somewhere else
You're not sitting in Hong Kong, although the tables and decor certainly look like many places there
Good food, friendly service and low prices
Can't beat it -- prepare to wait, but free wine makes that more bearable
I have been coming here since i was a twee little student, and it's still the best chinese restaurant in town
The free wine flows, just try and finish a carafe, and the impressively extensive menu offers delicious dishes you won't be able to finish
and it's dining on a dime to boot!
The wine cancels out the wait
The food cancels out the close quarters
This place beats Ollie's hands down
carafe after carafe of free wine, cheap, quality chinese food and a friendly staff
good for groups--always good times and never a dull moment- thank goodness for mass transit!
I have never been disappointed here
The menu is enormous, in fact it is hard to believe they can maintain such variety and high standards for a song
Come on, what is not to like
It is filled with drunk college kids gorging on free wine and picking at the mediocre food
Behave well and be polite to the staff and the wine will flow all night as you try to sort out the tiny bill at the end
This place is great! The food is really good and the free wine is flowing
Definitely not a place to come if you want a quiet romantic dinner
It is a place to come to if your looking for excellent, inexpensive chinese food and some free wine
Did I mention that it is my favorite restaurant?!?
The Scene Bamboo blinds and walls the color of jade set an otherworldly tone at this Vietnamese neighborhood restaurant
Sit up front, where on nice days windows are opened onto bustling Amsterdam Ave
On weekend nights, it's smart to get to the restaurant early
The Food Wade through the multi-page menu and you'll come across such great choices as chive and seafood dumpliings or monsoon rolls that interestingly come with three dipping sauces: mango, wasabi and red pepper
Roast duck salad, on a bed of mesclun, is great alone or to share, as is the tasty sliced Vietnamese steak, cooked medium-rare
Adventurous palates will enjoy fried frogs legs, but caramel-honey shrimp is bland
Ginger aficionados have plenty of choices, from the sweetened ginger iced tea and prawns and scallops cooked in a sesame ginger sauce to ginger ice cream and gingered creme brulee
Steamed black rice with coconut is a wonderful side dish
And desserts are quite good, especially the banana-black bean rolls, which look like sushi
I order from these guys once a week but I have to say dining at Monsoon is an UWS experience that is not to be missed
Spring rolls and lobster rolls are juicy to start and the sugarcane shrimp is worth a couple more orders
The Bo Luc Lac is delectable with tomato rice and greens while the seafood combo sets your tastebuds alight
The best thing about Monsoon is that dishes and sauces are so different from one another that each course is a flavor fiesta!
Disclosure: This was my first time eating Vietnamese food
That said, I thought the good was great (especially the shrimp dumplings), and it was a pretty good value ($14/person)
The restaurant isn't that large, but is decorated well, with a large mural and tables that aren't too close together
The only frustrating thing was the service -- the host told us that it would be a 5 minute wait, when it actually took 20 minutes
Further, our waiter was basically inattentive through the entire dinner (e
g
forgetting to bring us a dish, bringing us the wrong dish, etc
)
Definitely make reservations if you can -- they'll honor them, and you can skip the massive wait!
I have been to Monsoon a few times and the food is simply fab! Weekends tend to be a bit busier
I always have #19 combination of appetizers, which could be eaten as a meal by its self
The dishes are filled with flavors
I look forward to eating there for a long time
I ate here tonight with a girlfriend of mine, and the food was delicious
We split an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert, and our bill was only $40
The service was very knowledgeable and non-intrusive
It was great for a low-key, inexpensive, delicious meal
I highly recommend the honey caramel chicken
Having just spent 17 days in Vietnam, I can assure you that this food is good, well-priced and authentic
The service is ok and feels a bit rushed, but overall one cannot beat the food
As compared to other highly rated Vietnamese restaurants in this area, Monsoon is the best for food and price!
The staff at this restaurant is unbelievably rude
I took an out of town guest to the restaurant the night before Thanksgiving
The wait was long which is understandable but the waiters were rude to us while we waited, rushed us to order, ignored us while we ate and needed more drinks, and rushed us when they wanted the table for another couple
There are many other better choices in the area
They only brought out my date's dinner entree and when I asked if mine would be brought out soon, the waiter scolded me in a rude tone and said Be Patient! We're busy!
Go to Chinatown for the same quality and service at half the prices
Location is the only thing it has going for it
This Upper West Side closet space of a restaurant is always packed
It is cramped but nicely decorated if even romantic
Even if you make a reservation, be ready to wait atleast a half an hour for your table
But it is worth it
The food was great, some of the best Vietnamese cooking you could find in NYC served by a friendly staff
Try the assorted appetizer served with satay, sugar cane chicken and spring rolls
I love the tomato rice! Go for the food just be patient
It's been ages since I had Vietnamese, but I know I'll be going back soon after a trip to Monsoon's
The food was fantastic--don't miss the chicken/mango spring roll w/ wasabi/jalepeno sauce
Only drawback--the tables were really packed in there
But the ambience rich and dark, and the service was prompt and attentive
Not fabulous, but decent
They've seemingly made some cost-cutting measures that result in less tasty items (example, the beef satay appetizer now comes with shredded turnip instead of those tasty rice noodles, and they no longer offer the spicy cold chili cucumber salad

usually a mainstay of vietnamese restaurants)
That said, the food is good, although the beef can occaisionally be fatty and the curries are tasty
They also have fairly decent vegetarian offerings

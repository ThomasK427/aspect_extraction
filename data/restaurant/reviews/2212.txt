Try the Penne Bella Donna- it has eggplant and mozzarella
It was very good
My mother said the house red wine was delicious
Bricco's makes it themselves, so you can't buy it
(we asked
) the chocolate cake was good too, but dense, so I would split it w/ someone
If you are staying at the Park Central or the Wellington, the restaurant is less than a quarter of a mile away from both
I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner experience at Bricco
I was welcomed at the door and promptly invited to my seat
My girlfriend and I enjoyed an excellently prepared dinner with generous sized portions
There were plenty of choices on the menu along with several specials
The meal was priced very reasonably and the service was excellent
From the minute I walked in I was greated, in Italian, by a wonderful older man named Nino who immeadiatly took my rain coat and attempted to place it nicely on a hanger
When I told him not to worry, he told me that he was a perfectionist
I knew that the restaurant was special
Amazing food, like the octopus salad
Pasta is incredibly aldente, just how I like it
Great wine list at very reasonable prices
My only complaint is that the portions could be a bit bigger, though I will defintely be back
My husband and I were visiting NYC and based on a recommendation we ate at Bricco
We were delighted!! The food is outstanding! We started with the baked artichokes that we didn't think could be beat, but then the entrees
The gnocci special was AMAZING and the chocolate torte was out of this world
The service was great and we had a wonderful evening at Bricco
The Scene It's a big, splashy, exuberant place, perfect for a night on the town with fish-loving friends
You could dock a yacht in the huge open dining room, where curving concrete-faced walls are softened by gauzy white curtains anchored with fistfuls of garlic bulbs
A stunning fish display lets diners choose their dinner from the day's catch
The legions of well-informed servers stay busy without hovering
The Food This isn't for those on a budget, but portions are generous
A heap of smoky, tender grilled octopus; a teetering stack of lightly fried, addictively salty eggplant and zucchini chips; a four-spreads platter including suave garlic-almond skordalia and punchy feta-pepper dip--share these to save room for a whole grilled fish, like the delectable dourade, fresh from Greek waters and served split, boned and simply seasoned with olive oil and capers
This is going to make a dent in your wallet
so try to schedule a business meeting here! If the variety of fish is overwhelming, allow your waiter to help you decide
The fish can be shared by the entire table or each diner can have his own
The grilled octopus was exquisite, very soft
The Loupe De Mer was delicate and flavorful, and the snapper (I forgot which one exactly) was meaty and moist
The fish is not overly spiced so as not to detract from the fish's true flavor
It is perfect for summer dining! If you still have room for dessert, indulge yourself
The yogurt is quite flavorful and unique (from goat's milk?) and the portion is large - however, I was too full to really enjoy it
If you still want a little something, the fresh fruit is certainly big enough to share
What a magical place!!
The fishnet on the Mediterranean white walls, the flickering candelight and the freshest seafood around makes an evening at Estiatoria Milos, a night to remember
The food is great but the little touches make it especially enjoyable - the little oregano plant on your table that is clipped into your olive oil to eat with bread, the chatty waiter who suggests good wine and the glistening seafood laid out for you to choose from on mounds of ice
Expect to wait, even if you have a reservation
As a frequent and recent visitor to Milos, I have nothing but positive comments
The service has always been excellent, and I have always been seated promptly with a reservation
From food to beverages the staff clearly enjoy their jobs, especially the sommelier who pointed out some terrific, reasonably priced selections that paired very nicely with the fish
I have yet to find fresher, more expertly prepared fish anywhere in NY
The beauty of the fish really shines in Milos' simple preparations
Yes, the food may be high priced relative to other parts of the country, but for upscale dining in NY, considering the quality of food and care they take to ensure the best selections I found it very reasonable
An excellent spot for both business and pleasure
I have lived in NY for about 6 years and have eaten at many/most top restaurants in the city
And I have never been treated as poorly as at Milos
After making our party wait for about an hour past our reservation time (which we chalked up to it being a busy Friday night), they gave us a wobbly makeshift table that was set up in the path of the staff rushing out of the kitchen
When we asked for a different table, we were told that it would be another hour
and this news was conveyed without any sense of apology or effort to make us comfortable in any way
Really ridiculous for such overpriced food
extremely expensive service nothinggreat - fresh but so expensive - wines ok but the waiters have no clue ordered a calf Chard they brought me some australian one and tried to coax me into approving it I ask the guy just give me the wine i ordered they couldnt find ordered another calif chard couldnt find it , so i drank the australian towards the end after we finished the first bottle they asked me if i wanted another wine i said ok so then appeared my first choice Calif chard
it was so unprofessional
asked for the owner he hasnt been there in a long time he is spending alot of time in greece they told me, thats great for him but at those prices he should be focused at his rest
kind of got the feeling of eating in a glorious diner and taking out a loan for dinner
As someone who grew up in the mediterenean area, I Ilove this kind of food and I grill fish frequently
The food at Milos is good and simple
just the way it should be, nothing sophisticated
However, it's way overpriced
Greek food, specially grilled fish is simple
It is simple to make and simple to serve and usually doesn't take a $30K cooking school to learn
Even the drinks at the bar are above the average ($30 for 2 simple drinks)
and for the price the bartenders could be a little nicer
There are many other places in the city where you can get the same food for 1/4 of the price
I'll probably will never go again
I live in Minnesota, a place were seafood means beer battered Walleye
Being an native Chicagoian however, I know all kinds of fish, and most of my dinners that I cook at home are fresh fish
I have to say, the fish selection here is mind blowing! The 'cold ice' display is amazing, everything from Greek Pageot, to Protugease St
Francis, to Seabass from North Caroline
It's all here and it's all fresh! I had the Pageot (A kind of Greek snapper)
It was amazing, but very simply prepared as well
$78 for a 2lb fish seemed like alot (If I had a whole Pageot, I could probably prepare it the way they did
) But hey, you can't buy Pageot in MN! And if they sold it, i'm sure they'd pronounce it PA-GEE-OT :)
Also good Octopus appitizer
Everything about Milos was A-MA-ZING
Not only was the food fresh, authentic, and delicious, but we left dinner with a feeling of ultimate satisfaction
The Greek spreads were beautifully presented and equally scrumptous
If it wasn't for an early March storm, I could have been fooled that I was in Greece
My fiancee and I went to Milos for Valentine's Day and arrived promptly for our 9p
After being told that it would be another 5-10 minutes and waiting FORTY MINUTES later while watching FIVE different couples who arrived 20 min after us get seated by the windows, we finally approached the hostess
They proceeded to seat us at a table next to the kitchen
I don't mean 50 yards away, but an area where even the lighting was completely different from the rest of Milos (think flourescent lights and folding table)
For $87/person prix fixe, you expect a level of service commensurate
Ridiculous and I will tell anyone to AVOID THIS PLACE
Service is outstanding and waiters are helpful
Food are fresh and tasty but too expensive and a bit overpriced
This is a place where you will visit once, think it's not bad, but will never go again
I highly recommend the greek spread as an appetizer
It was all incredible! The food, the service, the presentation, the wine selection
Need I say more? Yeah, so you pay more, but it was so worth it! Get excited about picking your fish!!
Pristine fish, perfectly cooked, and that's all
There is not much excitement to this food, and given the simplicity of preparation (olive oil, capers, herbs) it is really a crime that it is so expensive
This restaurant proves that some people simply need to pay more
For fish of equal quality and better value, try Aquagrill instead
The food was amazing
I've never eaten such beautifully cooked fish

I wish I had found it earlier
They got is in quick without a reservation, go early, and served us even quicker
Portions normal for vietnamese, but get an appetizer or two
Dessert was even better
Best chocolate cake!!!! Go early and go often, Not expensive either
Fresh, delicious, creative food in an elegant atmosphere
Oh and the coffe and desserts are wonderful!!! Really really nice, would definitely go again
This restaurant has that special something(feng shui?) that almost guarantees a good time
The vietnamese cuisine here is better than Saigon_ and people love it
Best Vietnamese food
Call Bao's cuisine contemporary royal Vietnamese
Bao's dishes that a elegant, true vietnamese flavor, authentic
Try the spicy clam in beer , short rib on lemgrass stick and froglegs
The best vietnamese food
Someone did a great PR job for this place
Having read several reviews saying what good value this place was, went with my girlfriend
The vibe is nice in a New Yorky way, with B list models, their hangers on and low rent would-be players
The food was inventive and decent quality, (though portions were small and stingily excluded rice which cost extra) but what's up with the pricing? It's no bargain, that's for sure - expect to throw down a $100 easy for two, without going crazy
My main beef is the positioning of this place as 'cheap eats' when it ain't
Is this place really an offshoot of Indochine on Lafayette? If so, stick with the original
Concluding - I've NEVER left a restaurant hungry in NY before, nor my girlfriend who eats like a small bird, but we had to stop at Veniero's on the way home!
I was anxious to try this place
Bao was almost empty but the host was rude and refused to seat us for at least 15 minutes
We stayed unfortunately and ate a poor excuse for Vietnamese food
The fritters were burnt, the chicken satay was bland as well as virtually everything else
Only the short ribs were decent
The service was rushed and rude
Our waiter never asked us if we wanted a new drink
Spend your money elsewhere
Waited a long time for a 2nd course that we didn't even get, and we were hungry since the first course was barely enough to feed a chicken
Asked for the check since one hour is a bit long to wait for a bowl of soup, and we got a rude reaction
We got the check charging us for the 2nd course that we didn't even get, so they begrudgingly corrected this
All around bad experience, bad vibes, lousy value and quality
Treat yourself to something better
I had a wonderful first experience at Bao 111 just after it opened
I've been back many times with friends and on dates
I've enjoyed it so much I felt I had to say something
The food is incredibly good
Flavors inside of flavors
Subtle yet distinct
All the dishes are good and well presented, the staff is relaxed and friendly
Nicely designed interior
The people who run this place really know what they are doing and it shows
They bring on the sophistcation of gormet dining without all the pretense and hype, which in my book makes it about as hip as it gets

My dinig experience at bao was absolutely delightful
I've never had vietnameese food before and I have to admit it was excellent
I particularly liked the spring rolls and the drinks were great
I definitely will go back
The food is definitely one to come and try
I have eaten at many vietnamese themed places and this is better than most
Can get a little crowded in place but it's definitely worth a visit
Try the shortribs
Our party of 4 arrived without reservations and were seated quite promptly
The ambience was quite nice (except for some awkward paintings)
The salads were inventive and refreshing but the traditional vietnamese appetizers were mediocre
It took nearly 20 minutes for our entrees to arrive, and these were all disappointing - small, and nothing to rave about - we could have had the same meal in Chinatown for a quarter of the price
We didn't try the house drinks ($10 for a cocktail - hello, this is Ave C) but we did try some wines and we were disappointed
Desserts, though, were excellent and very unique
this place is all trendy loungy
think verlaine on LES
food here was average and not very authentic (i'm vietnamese)
the pho (beef noodle soup that is standard fare at all VN restaurants) was mostly soup and not much meat or noodles (read: a jip)
drinks were good but way expensive
service was friendly but slowww
I had heard a lot about Bao, from friends and neighbors,and of read some of the hype, so I was a little precautious
but from the friendly energy, coupled with the engaging staff and ending with great food, i was truly impressed
The new cocktail list, with saketinis made from house infused sakes and speciality drinks are definitely worth a try
The spring rolls are the best I have had
and dont forget to end with the pandan flan
The place can be a little noisy and the tables are quite close but all in all It is worth the trip
not a connoisseur of vietnamese food, but overall definitely a notch above the other vietnamese restaurants in the city
the chicken lollipop starters, fish of the day and lamb chops were the best of the food we ordered
among the desserts, the yucca cake is worth a try
we stuck with sake through the night as the inital shot at cocktails was not up to the mark
I totally disagree with the shoddy ratings below
going to dinner on a Saturday night in NYC is always going to be crowded and boisterous, especially in this neighborhood with this kind of menu (pricing) and after a few media outlets have highlighted this dining newcomer! What do you expect? My husband and I went on a Saturday night and it was noisy and the tables are a bit tight, but our food was excellent, our server engaged and helpful, and the experience was very good
Go for the food and fun, not for a quiet romantic dinner
The lemongrass sparerib appetizer is phenomal, and I had the pork satay
very spicy, very juicy
My husband had the filet mignon
also pretty tasty
And the wine list is good, some good value options as well as some higher end, more interesting wines
The food was good, the service definately needs to improve if this restaurant is to be reccomended
the Saigon beer (imported from Vietnam) and the shirt rib meat barbequed on lemon grass stem
Had the filet mignon the jumbo praws was excellent
Overall great food! slowservice
we went at 9:30 on a sat night and the place was full of screaming, drunk twentysomething posers
geez
the appetizwers were excellent, best frog's legs ever and the entrees we got were just ok
it's more of a scene than anything and i guess i've outgrown that
maybe return on a slow weeknight
service was very good but they were awfully busy
wine in water glasses is stupid, also
After my fourth visit i have decided i cannot find a bad dish on the menu
The shortribs, crab soup, seabass, curry shrimp, it goes on and on
The staff is so friendly and the neighborhood is so cool
Come down quick before you cant get in
If you are prepared to wait and wait and wait
and wait some more while being told only 10 more minutes about 4 or 5 times (with a reservation)

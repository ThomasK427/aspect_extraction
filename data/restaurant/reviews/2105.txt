The sushi is sublime - large, fresh pieces that practially melt in your mouth
The outside seating in the back is a plus - if you can get it, take it!
I have never had sub-par sushi here
It has always been gigantic and deliciously fresh, all four times that I've been
Can't wait to go back
Be prepared to wait, however, Cibar across the street and up a block makes a mean pre-dinner martini stop
the pieces of sushi are so big you'll wonder why you never went to yama before
the rolls are creative and generously sized
worth every penny
This place can't compare to Tomoe and Blue Ribbon
Some of the sushi is good but some of it is chewey/tough
The wait staff is good but on busy nights if you get the hostess and your dining alone and simply want a place at the sushi bar
this gal will seat people ahead of you
The bus people will grab the plate you've just had your last morsel
very rude
They peaked years ago
The portions of fish are huge
They were so large I had to eat with my hands
Very fresh and delicious and good service
Gets crowded
Yama has the best of everything
Amazing food, Nice Ambiance Impeccable Service =)
This place should be renamed McSushi
I give it quantity but its quality of fish leaves much to be desired
I have only been to the Irving Place location and despite waiting ofr a table the sushi is always the best
and huge!
I've been to a lot of Japanese Restaurants and I have to say this one takes the cake with the best bang for the buck--the prices are really reasonable for what you get and the sashimi is divine!
I couldn't stop saying wow that was good for about 1 hour after I left Yama
This is by far the best sushi I have ever had in NYC and I've tried a lot of places! Between the portion size, the amazing spicy mayo and mouth melting Salmon, my goal while living in New York is to become a regular at Yama
Best sushi I've tasted in town
just get creative with the a la carte sushi/roll menu
The portions are great, the size of the rolls are outrageous, and the price is generous
Recommendation: Crispy Shrimpy Roll!!!!
If you are willing to wait you will find no better standard sushi in this city
Anyone who knows food, not to mention, will avoid Yama like the plague
It's just a crowd pleaser - not quality but quantity
Not ambiance but crowding for the sake of a buck
Spend your money elsewhere!
I must admit that Yama was spectacular a couple of years ago
Large portions and fresh fish
But over the course of about 2 years, Yama has lost it's edge over other sushi restaurants
The quality of the food used to be worth the long waits but not anymore
I think I was in denial for a period of time due to terrific past experiences
The restaurant has simply lost it
Go to Blue Ribbon Sushi instead!
Even though the wait at the Houston and Irving Plaza are horrendous, the lines should tell you something about the food
It's fresh, adequately priced and the service is quick and precise
No dilly-dallying here, it's purely for the food
Always a recommendation to sushi lovers!
Wasabi saves the day because raw Fish can only be categorized as Fresh or Unfresh
Sure, Yama serves it fresh but so do half of the City's other sushi restaurants
Fresh sushi all tastes the same
Add a little wasabi and then you really can't tell the difference
Its also a psychological phenomenon how food can taste so much better when you shell out top dollar
Try the entrees instead, they are worth it! p
s
the key lies within the wasabi
Good wasabi can make bad sushi taste good and bad wasabi can make good sushi taste bad
You heard it here first! Enjoy!
The sushi is good, big and cheap! Every time I eat it I immediately crave more
The wait sux, but once you get in, the fish is so fresh it melts in your mouth
Don't forget that the pieces are AT LEAST twice as big as your average sushi place so don't order your normal amount cuz you won't be able to finish it! My favorite Yama by far is the Irving Place one
There is a high quality of food here but maybe each separate sushi could be a little smaller
Yama is awesome
The quality of their food is awesome, the staff is friendly, and the prices are right! After eating a wonderful meal of special rolls and HUGE pieces of sushi, I didn't even care how much the bill was, but to my surprise and delight it was less than $30 per person! The portions are so huge that you will be challenged to first that last piece of sushi! I have been to Nobu and Bond St, and their sushi (not main dishes) cannot compare to Yama! SO GOOD!
Being the fervid sushi lover that I am I had to give this place a try one day
The food is good depending on what sushi you order (some of the rolls are just OK)
The service is amazing and although this place is small, the wait is not that long
Definitely a great bang for your buck
Yum Yum
This place had some awesome sushi
It's really tiny though, but worth the wait
I've been dreaming about their spider rolls since I ate there a few months back
My mouth is drooling just thinking about them right now
love love love the food- i take all out of town guests here
i guess the long wait can be called part of the experience, but once you get your oversized sushi it all seems worth it
if you don't mind waiting forever, the sushi is unbelievable
huge pieces of fish and delicious rolls
great miso soup too
Do NOT go here in a large group, unless you want to be harassed for a bigger tip
Service was spotty (everyone couldn't eat at the same time, birthday cake was forgotten!, water not given though repeately asked for) so we left a 14% tip
Waiter started arguing and yelling at us to leave more and embarassed us in front of the entire restaurant
Not to mention, ending the birthday on a sour note
Wouldn't go back
Sushi was okay, cooked food sucked
There are better places to spend your money
Yuck
Granted the quality of the fish is good, but it is a total travesty that sushi is served this way
I'm not a sushi purist or anything, but it kind of grosses me out to basically eat an entire tuna laying on top of enough rice to feed a small family in Japan for a week
The waiters are nice, but weren't particularly good - waited forever to order and resented not being told that my dinner companion and I had ordered enough for a table of 10 (given the size of the sushi)
If you've totally internalized the American ethic that bigger is always better, you'll love this place
Otherwise, stay away or remember to only order 2 pieces
Yama has the freshest, best tasting sushi in the city
Their pieces are huge, but don't be fooled into thinking they're substituting quantity for quality
I prefer the Carmine street location by far, it's outdoor garden makes this heavenly experience even more pleasant
The Scene Petite Abeille is ideal for a lazy lunch, a restorative brunch or light dinner
The charming space is small and homey--blue-and-white checkerboard tablecloths cover the tables, a chalkboard serves as a wine list and the walls carry more Tintin memorabilia than a French nursery school
The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, but everything on it is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine and garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes; from a juicy croque monsieur and beyond
The pommes frites are top-notch, and there's an impressive array of Belgian beers to pair with your meal
Desserts are traditional, but chances are you won't have room left, anyway

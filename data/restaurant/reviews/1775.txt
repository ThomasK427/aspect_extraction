excellent - try the baby monster which is the smaller version of it's monster roll
I love the food at this place but what I like more is the staff
Family oriented and wonderful
Recently I had a bridal shower at this resturant
Because I am a good customer they gave me a great deal on my party of 26
We had our own buffet and everything came out super
I am sincerely their customer for life
In Short Moran's is a traditionally styled Old-World Irish tavern, located in a circa 1834 building decorated in dark wood, with tin ceilings, fireplaces and four dining rooms
The kitchen sticks to classics: steamed clams, raw oysters, boiled lobsters, porterhouse steaks, rack of lamb in red wine sauce and shrimp scampi
There is also a choice of pastas, including linguine Moran, with clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops in a garlic and white wine sauce
Had wedding here in '97, back at least once a year on anniversary - always enjoy the food memories
It was that good
Great steaks, fabulous desserts, even the vegetables and salads were excellent
The baby lamb chops are deservedly famous
What's more, the portions were huge and the value even bigger
All thanks to that humble genius of a manager, Tom Murphy
Even the jaded Manhattanites and snobbish Bostonians among our guests were impressed! A great place to tie the knot or just loosen your belt
The ambiance, food and service were all great
As soon as we walked in they took our coats and seated us by a fire place which was warm and romantic
We ordered fries as an appetizer, we really didn't see anything else we wanted
The portion was a little small but good enough to put something in the belly without getting full
I had the shrimp scampi with a yellow rice and sauted spinach and my botfriend had lamb chops which was not on the menu but they were kind enough to make any way, with mashed potatoes and sauted spinach
I never had to call the waitress over because she was very attentive even though she had other tables
The bill came to about $90 for the both of us, but if it had been more I wouldn't have minded paying for the over all experience
I got married here three years ago and it was an outstanding experience
The food and service were wonderful and they really worked with us beforehand to help us save money and have a great event (ask for Tom)
Have been back a few times for dinner and the food is very good, if a bit on the pricey side
I've never had a bad dish here, from grilled scallop salad to linguine and seafood to the 24 oz
porterhouse, it's always been good
Nice atmosphere as well, with lots of dark wood and crystal, tastefully done
I had a first date here and I think the lighting helped me land a second date! I swear
The food was really good, too
I thought it was very romantic
Tables are nicely spaced so you have privacy
Service is very fast and the waitresses are so sweet
If you want to look hot, but not actually be hot, don't sit near a fireplace
Especially in a wooly sweater!! There was a party going on in the next room and we barely heard them
Plus, there's parking right on the street
I loved the old New York feeling of the place
I've recommended this to all my friends looking for a romantic spot
Moran's is the most intimate restaurant we ever been to
My husband and I walked in there for the first time and looked at each other and said this is where we are getting married
There is a beautiful rustic party room in which we celebrated our amazing wedding
The service was very accomadating and the food was delicious
Every one of our guests loved the place and intend to go back for that cozy,romantic feel
We highly recommend Moran's for a delicious,romantic,intimate time
Enjoy!!!!!!
From the opening welcome to the last goodbye, the perfect spot to feel really good while dining well
The staff take care of your spirit, the chef takes care of your taste
Tom Murphy, the mgr extraordinaire, oversees it all with charm, efficiency and great style
Having a banquet (as we did)? This place will make you a hero with your guests! A true NYC treasure spot
Moran's is a cozy old-school retreat in the middle of the new Restaurant Row: fireplaces, great steaks, and friendly Irish service
They're great for private parties as well
Stopped by Moran's the other night for an impromtu birthday party
Very convivial atmosphere, very relaxed charming staff, even though eating late never felt rushed
Food was great
Only negative was that the wine selected was not available and another bottle was offered but we were not told that was another $10 in price
All in all a great place for large or small parties in a charming almost bygone New York!
We stopped by for lunch at the bar one day - calamari and drinks - and we loved it
Took 6 friends recently for dinner and they loved it
We're going back tonight to try that outrageous looking petite filet mignon
The only negative so far has been the lobster salad - way too salty
Everything else has been pleasant here
We're considering hosting a big birthday bash later this year at Moran's
Have only heard good things about it
The Scene Its artsy-craftsy, bay-windowed atmosphere may feel transplanted from San Francisco, but the clientele are full-fledged New Yorkers in-the-know seeking out stimulating, sophisticated and inexpensive Southeast Asian fare
The Food Nobody likes a show-off, but the cuisine coming out of this modest kitchen should be more touted
Fresh, clear flavors pervade the menu, especially in starters like plump steamed shrimp and chive dumplings with a lively ginger-lime soy dipping sauce and coconut-kissed carrots, peas, onions and zucchini stuffed in the tofu skin of the chay samosa
Herb-crusted scallops served in a subtle saffron and coconut sauce showcase the kitchen's light touch and wok-seared beef cubes are so well marinated that the tomato taste infuses and tenderizes the meat
Even the simplest dishes are finely prepared, such as broad rice noodles sauteed with chicken and bok choy
And desserts, including black sticky rice pudding, demonstrate the kitchen's creativity and clever restraint down to the last bite
My girlfriend and I stopped in for our first time last Monday
We live in the area and have never seen this place
I must say, were coming back
The food was excellent and our waiter was so cool
The table we ate on was a little tiny, but the food/decor/service made up for it
ON TOP OF THAT IT WAS CHEAP!
A friend told us about this little gem in Greenwich Village, Having lived in Paris for many years, it reminded me of a bistro in the Left Bank, everything is first rate, the amazing FOOD, the friendly, casual and easy going service, the ambience and of course the love, lovely, lovely garden, everything is so charming with excellent value
I love this place
I read a lot of the reviews on this site, but if you're gonna try this place, check out a review from a paper or magazine, because the entrees are really hit or miss
I ordered bo luc lac, and it was prepared totally wrong
The beef was WAY overcooked, and the tomatoes and onions were served sliced instead of in chunks--impossible to eat with chop sticks or without a knife (which they don't provide)
Also, they were out of our first choice bottle of wine, and then, instead of admitting they were out of our second choice, too, intentionally served us the wrong wine! On the plus side, the appetizers are way above average and the ambiance is great in either dining area
a friend of ours recommended we try the food so we stopped in last night
after looking at the menu for a few minutes we couldnt decide what we wanted! everything sounded tasty, so we asked one of the waiters if he could recommend something
after an extensive explanation of everything we pointed at we decided on the cari kapitan and a bee hun
THE FOOD WAS GREAT! and our waitor seemed to know the menu well
we ended with the flan desert which i could say wasnt nearly as good as the meal, but satisfying
good food, friendly service
a must
my first time here was great with a few friends
the second time here was horrendous
the service was slow and terrible
it's not often that one needs to ask for plates, menus, water, and other basic things from the waiters/waitresses
the food was great but service terrible
Went there last month with some friends for holidays party, Foods was great and generous portion, Gotta try the Fillet of Snapper ,cozy embian, good crowd, friendly waiter and good service
We had great time and definately good place to get together with friends
We had a full dinner: appetizer, entre, dessert and wine
The bill came and we tipped a generous 20% despite the horrible behavior, rude manner and slow service
It was ONE CENT short of a full 20% tip and the waiter came running after us

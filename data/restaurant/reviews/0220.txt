My dining companion's fish was quite good
The service was prompt, but not pushy, and they got us out in time for us to catch our show
Great service, enormous selection of Malt scotch and good draught beers
The food was quite passable but not extraordinary
Quite happy to find Ova Scotia (scotch eggs) on the menu, but they could have a little more spice to them
Surroundings were very pleasant, a good place for the young professional to meet or entertain
Service staff very friendly and attentive
St
Andrews is a great bar to sample great pub grub
They've got beers from around the world and some of the best chips (fries) this side of the pond
The service is terrific and the bartenders are great guys
I' recommend this bar to just about anyone and you could probably get away with taking your kids there during the day
Definately chick it out
My wife and I took our granddaughter to see The Lion King and we ate here after the matinee
The decor is very pleasant and we had a table overlooking 8th avenue
The service was very good and the food was close to excellent
Prices are quite reasonable for New York
The overall experience was very, very good
I would recommend it without reservation
Want a beer or Burger before or after the thearter? Me and a bunch of friends hit this restaurant and had a blast
Try to check it out!
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste
This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else
Steam engine is still chugging but service seems to be coming down
Tandoori is always excellent
Maybe showing strains of getting stretched a little thin with the increased destinations, et all
The food was boring and expensive
They charge $6
00 for rice
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops
Not worth the prices
Bukhara Grill lives up to its name as the the Indian Spice rave
it now has three locations the first one in NYC, and now Yonkers and also New Jersey
i have had all three and all were very good
New York City- i have been going here for about 4 years and i just love it
The location , food and the service
The uniform on the waiters is just as nice as they are as they always are smiling and helping
My favorite dishes are mal mal kabab, haryali chicken, DaL Bukhara and everything
Awsome place and owners are very nice always working and making Bukhara a friendly enviroment
New Jersey- My Parents live in Jersey so i was there last week and drove by the new Bukhara
So i picked up my parents and sister and we went here for dinner
Its a different type of Bukhara
its more of an express sit in and take out
The colors were very nice and bright
We get to watch B4U as we were eating
This also has Indian Chines, South indian and north indian
So now evertime i got to Jersey i can have bukhara as well
Yonkers- I actully havent ate in the restarant
I went to a party in the hall
the hall was beautiful and the restaurant was being renovated to give the Bukhara look
the party was awsome and so was the food
i will deff have to go here for a proper sit down soon
ive been going here for like 3 yrs
whats there not to love about Bukhara Grill the staff is down to earth The food is the Best!!!! the decor is and old rustic look my fav are mal mal kabab, lambchop, and of course the most popular dish in Bukhara Dhal Bukhara!!!!
It's not the cheapest of places, but the food is fantastic
The food bursts with flavor and the spicy dishes are really hot the way they are supposed to be
They also get points for excelling at the small things, like the breads, the rice and samosas: these are among the best samosas I've ever head

Busboy cleared a little early
Because we were dining pre-theatre it was a little hurried on our part
Our picks and pans: Music -thumbs down
Very loud Euro trash electronic monotonous droning
Definitely not suitable for the pre-theater crowd
It might be good for the after work crowd
Their pre-theater prix fixe was a cut above the rest: appetizer stand out - Duck breast with mushroom canelloni
Don't bother with the corn chowder/clam/chorizo soup
The chorizo was a memory and sounded better on the menu
We ordered the Tuna a la carte and Wild Salmon and chicken breast on the Prix Fixe
Large flavorful portions with great touches (Fiddlehead ferns were among the spring vegetables with the salmon
) Desserts were also delicious and great for sharing
We are definitely going back
Try not to sit near the back door
We were told it was locked and then 4 people blew past us
Fun lobby for drinks
I love the Royalton and I used to eat at 44 in 2003 and there were many things i did not like
I recently came back and I can not express how fabulous it is now
WHAT A COME BACK!!!! They must have hired a fabulous new chef because the food is so eccentric and tastey
I would highly recommend the prosciutto wrapped shrimp which is to die for, and the entree lobster risotto is fabulous
It is a great atmosphere and a great date place or also a cool after work place to nosh and experience a diverse menu in a hip space
Since re-discovering this new and improved restaurant I eat at 44 at least once a week and sometimes more
I cannot express how great it is in words, go in and check it and experience something special
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED A+
I used to dine here but the sevice was terrible
They now have a Top Notch Manager running the show
He is very attentive and nows how make you feel welome
I think this new person will ehance your dinning experience
Rummor has it - he came in from the West Coast and knows the restaurant the business
Chef is also very creative
Bartenders are just ok - but maybe the new guy from out west will clean this up and let them go
The bartenders make good drinks, but with an attitude
They are the ones serving you but yet they have this attitude that every customer is below them
I used to enjoy this scene, but now it is so dried out
No one is there
There are these poor fishes swimming around in dirty water for decoration
The coolest thing about this place is the bathrooms
Bottom line; this place is not worth the price or the attitude you get

Brought my friends for pre-theatre dinner because of the location, and had a reaaly great meal
Food was increadible, our waiter was really helpful about wine suggesstions (didn't try to screw us at all!), and got us out in plenty of time for the show
Went back a few days later for drinks, and had another great nite
We had the BEST time!!! People used to say that this place was snotty - not true
Everyone, from the cocktail waitresses in the lounge to the staff in the dining room, could not have been nicer
The food was great, we had the beef tenderloin and the salmon
Whoever said this place was too hip and unfriendly hasn't been there in the last year, because this is the third time we've been and it's always been great
i got the loster salad appetizer last night - it was $19 - and the lobster tasted funny - kind of like detergent or something
then i got a piece of turbot (a type of white fish) which was around $33 and it tasted kind of fishy and bland
the olive bread and butter was good though
and my friend LOVED her steak
We sat in a booth - on this velvet type of material and it was really dirty
I was so happy to meet up with friends there and to remember how cool the vodka bar and 44 restauran is t is
The fish was perfect and the martinis are always yummy
The music industry still frequents this place and brings a cool vibe and crowd coming back year after year
Maybe being from SF and being used to good mexican food has something to do with my comment:  I had a chile relleno that tasted old, rice wasn't cooked all the way and the salsa was not tasty enough
I had dinner at this place 10 years ago and it was the same
I really hope that they improve on flavor since the location is superb!
I ordered a chicken dish, which was shredded chicken, tasted old
I hardly ate it
Thanks goodness for the chips and salsa
They were overcrowed the night we were there, and stuck us in the middle of an aisle between two tables
I ordered a frozen Mudslide and the bartender didn't know how to make it
Considering this place was in the heart of Times Square, I would have thought it would have been better
Also, considering the line we were in to get into the place, I thought it would have been much better
In my opinion, there are too many other good Mexican Restaurants in NYC
I would stay away from this one
This is a Classic mexican joint- chips/salsa before dinner with typical dishes including beans and rice with cheese and salsa on everything
Service was okay, food was decent, nothing fancy, probably expected more due to the location
Being in the heart of Times Square this is not a bad value for the money but nothing extroidinary
VERY courteous waiters bring bowls of chips and salsa and a glass of ice water to your table within minutes of seating you
They take your order (I always order Steak Fajitas here) and they serve you your main dish VERY quickly
Powerful Margaritas too
This place is rather expensive, but it's right in the heart of Times Square/Theatre District and if you like Mexican food, the quality and deliciousness can't be beat
I went here on a Weds night
Not crowded, got a table right away
The food is good, not too spicy but tasty, however I do not recommend the margaritas, try the Sangria instead
In Short This Louisiana-inspired restaurant, decorated with wood plank-floors and New Orleans bar signs, has a roadhouse feel that's festive, but relaxed enough for dinner conversation
Cajun highlights include jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and stewed alligator tail, as well as the quick-serve hurricanes and Sazeracs
Jazz, bluegrass and zydeco bands play weekend nights (beginning around 10:30pm) and Sunday brunch
We arrived from Boston, hungry and tired and ready for drinks and appetizers and a bit of pampering
We passed many spots and randomly picked the Delta Grill
The waiter could not have been more patient with us as we (okay, my wife) made her decision on appetizers
She had the Sticky Chicken, which was excellent (decadent, tangy and sweet) and the Crawfish Popcorn was very good and while we left to meet friends, we left wishing we stayed for dinner
Later, we realized my wide had left her purse on the floor by our table
When we returned 3 hours later, her purse was waiting safely there for her and the manager could not have been nicer
So we hope you enjoy the Delta Grill for their food, service and honesty! We did!
My boyfriend and I eat here probably once a month
We live a block or 2 away and find that it hits the spot when all youre looking for is some good southern comfort food (especially when youre hungover!)
The entrees are supersized and although I usually dont take doggie bags, in this case I do and i have dinner for another night or two
I find the fried chicken to be a stand out choice
the chicken is always juicy and they let you mix and match sides from other dishes if you ask (their mashed potatoes have a little kick and shouldnt be missed)
Be SURE to order a side of the mac n' cheese to share with someone
it's hands down the best I've ever had
Prices are totally reasonable
We went to The Delta Grill for Sunday brunch and thought it was awesome! Went early - around 12pm - and the place was mostly empty
By 1pm it was packed
Great brunch selections or you can order off the regular menu
We had omelets with fun things like tasso and andoulle sausage, poached eggs over biscuits, and this crazy omelet-in-potato thing - delicious!! The beignets were great too
Live music was nice, not at all loud and intrusive
Definitely recommend it - can't wait to go back and try dinner!

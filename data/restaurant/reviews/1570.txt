I booked for 6pm which meant we had a good pick of tables and we settled into a romantic booth in the corner
I had the risotto, duck and frozen lime mousse and my boyfriend had a salad, tuna filet mignon and espresso fudge cake
The flavours of the ingredients complimented each other beautifully
Neither of us had wine so can't comment on the selection
There is good reason this is considered by many to be one of NYC's best restaurants although there are several in this price range which offer a similar level of quality
A month later, and I still can't stop gushing about USC
And I can't wait to go back
Food was absolutely exquisite -- the best foie gras I've ever had, hands down
My boyfriend ordered the shell steak, and it was perfection, simply seasoned with salt/pepper/garlic powder
Service was warm and friendly, and completely unpretentious unlikes some of the other top restaurants in New York
I have to say that my dinner at USC was my best dining experience yet, despite the fact that I lived in the SF Bay Area (another food mecca) for my first 26 years, and after having dined in some of the finest restaurantst in Napa Valley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles
Had dinner at UnSquaCaf last night with my girlfriend, my brother, and his fiancee
Fantastic food and wine all around, especially the duck
Huge portions the side dishes themselves could be meals
Service was excellent (with one minor gaffe), entertaining, and gracious
The restaurant's decor leaves something to be desired one could argue that it's downright ugly, but I say it's simply boring
Other than that, a terrific experience
My daughter and I had dinner here on Sunday night and had a very nice meal and evening
We were seated in a small area to the left of the bar and it was quiet enough to carry on a good converation
The meal was delicious from the cocktails to the dessert
The staff is very professional and friendly
There is no question that USC is one of NYC's top restaurants
I have been to restaurants around the world, and this is in my top 5
Menu is simple, but each item is an all-star
Don't miss the Gnocchi Appetizer or the Oysters of the day
Make sure you get there early and enjoy a cocktail at the bar
They have quality beer and a fantastic wine list
A bit pricy, but worth every penny
If you like this try their other spots across NYC
This has got to be one of the most overrated and pretentious restaurants I have ever experienced
The overwhelmingly glowing reviews are totally baffling to me
One of the previous reviewers, who stated that the food was over-salted, was absolutely correct
It is also uninspired and uncreative
The desserts, which get particularly high praise, were assembly-line quality
I can think of dozens of restaurant where one's money can be much better spent
Everything that you've heard about USC is true
Every bite of the food will excite you
The service is exceptional, and the wine list reads like a wine snob's Christmas wish list
For example, the dessert menu contains '63, '77, and '85 Taylor Fladgate Porto and several vintages of Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes
As I collect various '85 port vintages, I was impressed
There is an exceptional attention to detail at USC
My companion's fish came with sliced avocado
USC has a cold smoker and smoked the avocado in order to make the dish more complex
It works
Although some may think USC is a bit pricey, when the food is this good, it's a bargain at twice the price
No wonder USC is rated consistently as one of the top two restaurants by Zagats
Union Square Cafe is an enduring allstar
I was blown away when I heard that it was celebrating it's twenty year birthday this upcoming October
I have been dining at USC for some time now, and am continually blown away by it's consistant excellence
New Chef de Cuisine, Carmen Quagliata really knows how to cook traditional Italian Greenmarket fare, he is a perfect compliment to Michael Romano
The Bar staff and Dining Room Staff are truly caring and go out of their way to meet your needs
Now I know why it is always packed!  p
s
one of the best priced wine lists in New York City
While the Union Square Cafe perennially sits at or close to the top of the lists of Manhattan restaurants, I am not sure if it still lives up to its superlative rankings
Certainly, the food is very good
But among the very best in NYC? I don't think so
USCs menu offerings are not unique compared to other top NYC restaurants
While I understand that USC is a cafe, and therefore can be given some slack on issues such as the amateurish utensils, marginal dcor and a robotic, uninspired wait staff (who seemed to pay more attention to perfecting the settings of recently vacated tables than to the existing customers), I still have to say that the gushing reviews in Zagat lead to undeserved expectations
That is not to say I wouldn't go to USC again -- I would
But take it off the A+ list, it doesn't belong there
their food is always consistantly good
from start to the end
but what make this restaurant so special? management staffs offer the best service
wait staffs are friendly but you walk into the restaurant with smiling faces of management staffs that it almost makes wait staffs look angry
i really like this restaurant
good food and great service!
While the food was superb, my wife and I were greeted by a rude host who accused me of making a reservation at another restaurant
Went on to tell me that I did not leave my first name only for a reservation and that their restaurant only took last names
This was not the case
I was given a reservation earier in the day, by a female other than the male host, but waited for 45 minutes for my table
Very smug and pretentious
We started off on the wrong foot which left us both very uncomfortable
We still spent over $300
If I wasn't hung up on the mystique, we would have walked
Pretty much all I had hoped to find in one of the most successful and long-standing restaurants in NYC
Don't miss the calamari--it will set a new standard
The fettucine al tartufo was simple and delicious
Also great: the yellowfin tuna burger
Pumpkin upside down cake was a delight, and the day's special dessert, cappucino panna cotta, was a fine example of what panna cotta should be
The service is by far the best in the city
Extremely nice and well informed
The food is excellent
Highly recommend the venison
And don't forget to get the garlic potato chips
Make sure to save room for dessert
Incredible selection and delicious
I come to New York every year for the Marathon and spend alot of time checking restaurants on citysearch and the zagat guide
This has to be the best restaurant that I have eaten in so far
The food was fantastic and the service was just right, not too pushy
We had two bottles of wine and two courses and our meal came to about $70 each, well worth it considering that we usually spend this and above and have had meals that come nowhere near this quality
Went for dinner and the service seemed a lil off compared to lunch
Pasta dishes were excellent as usual however, I had to send my entree back
it was corrected and my desert, the pear crisp, was delicious
I had the chance to eat there twice in the past few weeks
great experience both times! Service was among the best in the city, attentive, kind, friendly and HELPFUL!!! Anticipated the needs of the guests, and never once had to ask for anything because it showed automatically
Food flavors were wonderfully tasty and well presented
Friends raved about the lobster shepard's pie, I LOVED the appetizer of roasted corn and proscuitto
save room for dessert
you'll want to linger in this most wonderful atmosphere--its been a long time since you've been pampered so well in a resturant

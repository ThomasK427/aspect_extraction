The wait is worth it, and so is the crowded seating
The crunchy french toast is a MUST, the granola with fruit is great, milkshakes and apple crumb dessert should not be passed by
No matter what, you will find something that will satisfy on this diner-like menu
A great place for the entire family
The food is good
The prices are reasonable
And they cater to the kids
no matter how young they are
The Scene Despite the name, Candle Cafe is clean of wax drippings and chooses to light its warm, woody environs with unobtrusive electric fixtures
The mood is equally bright, thanks to amusing decorative touches, charming servers and a palpable lack of dietary guilt among the patrons
The Food The menu reflects much loving experimentation
It remains grounded, however, thanks to a thorough glossary (for folks who don't know what seitan or macrobiotics are) and an array of straightforward, incidentally vegetarian dishes like the robust ginger-miso stir fry
For those comfortable in veggie cuisine territory, Candle Cafe's seitan is full-flavored enough, especially in a chimichurri appetizer, to anchor all its preparations here
Fresh, smartly dressed salads are a tasty good value
Be unorthodox and, in place of dessert, order up a zippy custom smoothie
I went to this place first about a month ago and was a little wary because it was all vegatarian, but the food was absolutely amazing
We had 4 appetizers, 2 main courses, and dessert- and nothing was a disappointment
The servers are also really helpful in explaining the menu (like seitan- never heard of it before I went to this place)
I've been back once already and definitely will continue to go
If the cafe on 75th is busy, they have another location just up the street on 79th, which is huge
I just got back from The Candle Cafe and the food was exellent! Nice sized portions with great flavors
The staff was okay--they were very helpful and friendly if I asked a question--but they don't stop by too often
The only downsize is the price--way expensive
Lunch specials hover around $13 or so, but go as hight as $18
I understand the reason for this, but I will definitely eat there many more times! Good to have such options on the UES
i can't tell you how much i love this place and the people who work there
you feel so good while you're there, the food and wine is organic and fresh and tasty, and the staff is warm and helpful
just eating there makes you want to be a better person, or at least eat like one
And so do thousands of other New Yorkers and travelling vegans from around the country and world
It's always packed, so you know they have a good thing going on
But taste for yourself -- it's absolutely delicious!!
Despite the not so hot decor, this place is the place to try if you're thinking of becoming a vegetarian or love interesting vegetarian dishes
I first discovered seitan at Candle's and am totally hooked on it
Their specials are usually the best dishes and change quite frequently but are a little on the steep side
I've also been to Candle's 79, their upscale version
Really upscale
over priced
wouldn't go there again when I can get it cheaper at the Cafe
An excellent vegan restaurant with a very loyal following
You don't need to be vegetarian to enjoy the food here
There is a menu with plenty of choices that both the carnivorous and the herbivorous can enjoy
Everything is organic and extremely fresh
My favorite dish is the vegan lasagne
The portions are generous but you wont leave feeling stuffed, even if you have one of their scrumptious desserts
Candle Cafe has a diverse menu and changes seasonally with the fresh ingredients available
Always something new to try, the drinks and smoothies are quite good too
The service is prompt and courteous, staff is friendly, the decor is contemporary and clean
The one big drawback for me however is that in recent months probably as a cost saving measure they have been serving diminished portions which I think is a shame
Still a good place though to stop by after doing the museums on the Upper East Side
Not being a big veggie eater, I decided to try it to see other types of food
I was pleasanly surprised with my salad and my seitan parmigana
It actually tasted somewhat liked a veal parm
The dessert was peanut butter terrine which definately hit the spot
For the adventurous who are used to steak and pork, take a chance on this place
This was the best veggie food I've ever had
It was brilliant to go to a restaurant and have a real choice! With a wonderful atmosphere, polite staff and delicious food this place has everything a veggie diner needs
The Candle Cafe is a very good vegeterian restaurant
I have eaten here many times over the past four years
I have never been dissappointed
Their food and their juice bar are both good
Even if your not a vegetarian and are just in the mood to have a healthy meal this is the place to go
It is a small place and they do a lot of business
On first entering this small cafe, I was a bit offset by all the anti-fur, we love animals signs
Once we were seated, however, I discovered just how warm and welcoming the atmosphere is
The waiters are friendly and the service is prompt, and the food is excellent
The noise can be a bit much, but overall a great place
I simply could not LIVE without Candle Cafe and their juice bar
I get juices from them several times a week and dine there for full meals at least monthly
A great option for vegans and veggie lovers, as well as carnivores
Try the Casserole - it ROCKS!!
I'm not a vegetarian, either, but I try to eat less meat, and I thought the food at Candle Cafe was delish! I had a great 3-bean chili with a slightly sweet blue cornbread and a large grainy salad
I also had a bite of my companion's Seitan Steak and enjoyed it thoroughly
Though the dining area is fairly small, it wasn't too crowded on an early Sunday evening, the atmosphere was pleasant and the wait-staff prompt about re-filling waters
Wish I'd had room for dessert
I am not a vegetarian or a vegan but I just enjoy their creative vegan cuisine
I can't say that for all vegetarian restaurants in the city, most if the time vegetarian food taste like it is made with some mystery ingredients
If you wan to take break from the ordinary and take a ride in the wild vegan side come and dine at this restaurant
They offer anything from an organic wine and beer to delicious deserts all prepared without the slightest animal product even the cream on the banana cake
Simply amazing! Dont forget their organic juice bar
Lately its been very crowded, I guess their fame travels all over
Well if you are one of the citys top vegan places, people will travel
From my luck I happened to live two blocks away from this gem of a restaurant
Very friendly and courteous staff
Although it's a schlep to get to this place from Brooklyn it's well worth it
The tofu club is delicious, the miso soup is just right and the desserts are amazing
The space is a bit cramped and the waitstaff should smile some more
But when it comes to delicious 100% vegetarian food, this is the best restaurant in New York City
Expect to talk to a disgruntled worker when placing an order from a mediocre pizzaria
this place is great, sooo cheap and excellent food (especially the falafel)
service is quick and friendly
My friend and I had pizza for dinner and wanted dessert
We decided to go to Da Filippo Restaurante Italian to get dessert and coffee
They sat us and when the waiter asked us if we wanted wine with dinner
I replied, no, thank you, we are here for coffee and dessert
He leaves and comes back and says, no coffee and dessert here
We left, went across the street and got our coffee and dessert
I have never heard of any restaurant in NYC turning people away if they want to order coffee and dessert only without dinner
I definitely would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
I went here last night for a friends birthday and was very dissapointed
My steak was undercooked on the inside and burnt on the outside, the service was slow and it was pretty pricey

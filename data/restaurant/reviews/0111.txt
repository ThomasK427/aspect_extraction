Excellent food, attentive service and stimulating atmosphere


I would definitely recommend this restaurant
I was worried its location in the balcony of the Grand Central terminal would be noisy, but it was perfect
Metrazur was an overall wonderful dining experience
The ambience was classy and relaxed
The setting was quiet, romantic, and just interesting overlooking the main terminal of Grand Central
All of the staff from the bus boys, to the hostess, the the waitress were very accommodating
The waitress offered her suggestions and was very honest
The Yellowfin Tuna Tartare was tasty (a bit too creamy) but very good and spiced just right
Entrees: Trout was tasty and in a splendid sauce with caviar
YUM! I also tasted the Duck which was done just right! For dessert, I tasted the Walnut Apple Tart
The whole atmosphere was perfect and I never felt rushed
A great place for a date or an occassion
I would go back for other tastings of the other items on the menu!!
I have been to Metrazur on numerous occasions
It is an extremely conveinent place to stop for a few cocktails on my way home
HOWEVER, the new hostess has turned this into my favorite place in the city
Myah is the friendliest, sweetest, hottest woman that I have seen in a long, long time! Thank you for your hospitality! I will definitely be back
Many, Many
Many times
Did I say many?
The open-air area is not good for conversation b/c it still is GCS
But the food is good; try the lobster with saffron sauce, very good
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews
Also good for client lunch meetings, esp
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location! Pricey, but worth a try, at least once
Check out the cookies plate - excellent value for money and the best chocolate cookies on the planet!
Choppy service with a bit of attitude thrown in -when we asked for the restaurant week prix fix menus the aiter made a face
The food was OK and the Restaurant Week menu was diverse with sufficient choices but overall it was disappointing
The waiter brought our friend's birthday dessert out after we had all finished our desserts and coffee- we figured he forgot and then along came another dessert with a candle this time- the same thing she had, had with the prix fix lunch- we would have been happy for a candle in the one we paid for- with the choices in Grand Central these days this is one to skip
Great space, such a beautiful building
Surprizingly quiet for such a busy hall - easy to have a conversation
Food was relatively good, not outstanding, but not bad
But the service - oh the service
Terrible
Felt like they were really doing us a favor
Took ages to get our food, and the waiter was incompetent (eg
didnt bring bread plates or water after 3 requests)
i'm not an ice cream lover, but it came with the lunch pre-fixe, and i actually ordered seconds!!! they make it there, and it shows!!!!!! get the chocolate and the homemade hot fudge, and enjoy!!!
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central
It was a very nice surprise
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view! My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely dinner with the interesting locale and excellent service; our waiter was great! I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view
The view you have from your seat looking down into Grand Central is great even for a local
The service is good, the food is good but a little pricey, but you pay for the location though, which is pretty much worth it
I am a huge fan of Charlie Palmer, and this restaurant for tourests, commuters, or any kind of diner is fantastic
Though a little pricey, it was well worth it, the veiw was breath-taking
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty
Besides, we were on vacation!
Geat restaurant in a fabulous space
People watching from thi grand Central balcony cannot be beat
You never had food this good in any train station this side of Paris
Why do people rave about the ambience
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character
Food was OK - fish was cooked well
But, nothing stands out about the cooking
Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation
The Scene Though there aren't a lot of restaurants smaller than this one, but with deft, warm service, pretty decorating touches and clever arrangement, the restaurant does its best with the space
Still, some may find it hard to have a romantic dinner with the next table so close
A wine-filled loft overlooks the dining area, reminding the young, couply clientele that beverage is half the experience
The Food The menu changes daily, and dishes feature bright, clean flavors that highlight the quality and freshness of their ingredients
A salad of slightly wilted kernels of popped corn in meaty olive vinaigrette startles, then pleases; arugula with perfect apple dice is less eye-opening, but just as satisfying
Wine-hibiscus reduction tarts up rare, tender venison medallions, and floating juniper oil does the same for lush venison consomme
An ice cream sandwich made with Rice Krispie treats ends the meal with a bang
The food and service are always excellent, the wine listupdates frequently
The Colin and Renee are around and greet like family
Love it here
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must
The entire dining experience was wonderful!
Went last night and had a wonderful experience
A popcorn-dandelion-microgreen salad was amazing in its combination of tastes
Also had fluke carpaccio, hen-of-the-woods with a soft boiled egg, and guine hen
Everything was out of this world
Ended with an incredible chocolate hazelhut desert
Wines are reasonable priced
Service was very attentive and friendly
When my date wanted to cancel an order, they did not hesitate and no attitude was given
My only caveat is that it is a tiny place, but that's it!
The food is expensive, but worth every bite
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good
You will be satisfied
Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
This place may be the best kept Culinary secret in NYC
I have dined at TTR 3 times an each and every time I am more amazed
while the menu constantly changes, its consistency is beyond excellent
They are spot on with their selection of California wine on their wine list
The service is amazing; the staff makes you feel like you are dining at a private dinner party
We brought 2 bottles of our own to try, but could not pass up 2 bottles from the wine list
The mark-up on the wine list is very reasonable
Best I have seen in NYC
They decanted our wine, allowed us to drink parallel and didn't charge us a corkage
5 people for dinner, 2 bottles of wine, almost one of each item from the menu
Dinner was $350

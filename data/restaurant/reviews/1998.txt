Service was great
I'm very surprised to read some of the mediocre comments on Tribeca Grill
My family and I dined at Tribeca Grill on a trip from our home in Georgia, and the entire experience was excellent! From the moment we called in for a reservation to when we walked out the door, the entire staff was considerate and even went out of their way to be helpful
THe manager even came over to see how we were doing
The food was great!!! Great value for a NYC restaurant
I recommend the duck!
Food was good, but they give you small portions, and it is very high priced
Not a good value at all
I had the rack of lamb for $32 and you get 3 ribs and the meat is about the size of a quarter
The side of mashed potato's for $5 tasted like boiled potato's mashed with no seasonings, not edible
Definitely not worth the money
Left there hungry
Will not return!!
A bit confused here, as my previous review was for Gotham Bar and Grill (how did it end up here?), but I've got opinions about this place as well
Honestly did not see the big 'celebrity' deal in this place
Saw loads of families, that's about it
The food was nice, not fantastic, but nice
Service was good, and the atmosphere pleasant
I recall that I was there on a slow night, so maybe this place picks up, but from what I saw, it wasn't anything over the top
Celebrities go where the food is too expensive for their own good and so I'm not surprised that there are lots of star spottings in this place
First -- the food is great but could they spare it? For the price, I think that a bit more food could be nice
I had the Linguine with White Clam Sauce
since when are there big chunks of onions in clam sauce?
The food here was fantastic
There was just the right amount of influence from each ingredient of the Snapper
They have a nice menu and a friendly staff
I will definitely return
As a visitor to New York, I'm always looking for places to spot celebrities and I heard Tribeca Grill was the place to go
Although I didn't get to see Robert DeNiro, I had a very enjoyable evening and will definitely go back again
another bobby deniro co-owned restaurant
i prefer nobu
what you get here, is standard american fare
the food is decent, but nothing to rave over
can't seem to see mr
deniro in any of his restaurants
oh well
I was quite impressed with the diligence of the wait staff, the promptness and taste of the food, but found the menu selections very limited
The wine list had more to choose from (over 1500) than the menu
Nice atmosphere and every table seemed to be having a great time
Nice place to stop and have a drink at the bar
My Fiancee' and I recently had the pleasure of dining at your restaurant
The special for the evening was Venison
I have to say, I am not a big fan of venison, but I honestly could say, I wouldn't have it anywhere else
We both ordered the same entree'
We were absolutely delighted with the flavorful, tender meat
We will be back again soon
Hopefully, before Christmas
Thank you very much for a wonderful evening! SharonAnn Derek
I went there with my boyfriend son saturday night and they had a price fixed menu for $33
lots of food, great service, i'll definitely come back!!
Maybe it's seen better days
I first went a few years ago and was pleased, but thought that it was on its way up given the hype (there was room for improvement)
After dinner there last night, decided that it was on its way down, so I must have missed its peak!  The food was minimal and simply average
If the prices were about 30% less, the expereince would've been better
I was disappointed---and I left with an appetite!
My dinner party and I had reservations on a Saturday night, we were seated promptly
The service was average
But if you are hungry and looking for great food, you should look else where
I had the soft shell crab which was a special for the night
The portions are small and the prices are ridiculous
I wouldn't go back
The dress was very casual
I was very excited to try this restaurant which I have heard so much about, but my friend and I had a disappointing experience
The atmosphere was lovely, but the food was very average
If your in New York and can't decide a place to eat i would highly recommend going here, that is if you can get a reservation! The atmosphere is wonderfull and the service there is superb
It's by far my favorite place to dine out at
I went on a Thursday night to pickup dinner to go and found the restaurant surprisingly empty
People, this is probably the best hidden secret in Chinatown!   I got their lanzhou beef noodle soup, a dry beef sauce noodle, and a plate of sauted vegetable
The vegetable dish was at least as good if not better than those of other restaurants in Chinatown, but the Lanzhou noodle was just absolutely amazing! Their noodle is the most authentic Lanzhou noodle I have found in New York (including Flushing)
The dcor and ambiance could probably use some professional help, but with such low prices on the men, I have no complaints
This is probably not the place to go for a candle light dinner
But if you want a down-to-earth but out-of-this-world Lanzhou ramen noodle, this is THE place to go!
this place is the best food in chinatown
perfect pricing for large quantities of food HIGHLY RECCOMENDED for fresh cheap delicious food
This is the best place to come to if you like fresh noodle soup
They make their own noodle (make sure you choose the Lanchau style noodle soup) - and the soups are just superb
Flavors are delicate - not as strong as Thai curries
They are ready to make anything you want - so if you want something that's not in the menu, let them know
You can add extra vegetables for an additional 50 cents - but they mention that in the menu only in Chinese
Noodle soup quantities are huge - so don't go for the rest of the menu - the rest are at par with the rest of Chinatown
This is a good hang-out place with friends or by yourself
The food is great
Its cheap
Its worth a try
Good seafood hotpot buffet style! Great place for friends gathering
Went there with 3 friends
To be honest with you the appatizers are bigger than the acutal main dishes
Buffalo mozz app is out of this world
Had seafood ling
Very good!!! Good food, super service Waiter was the man, fast seating, great place
I would go back but there are just so many to choose from in NYC
Filet comprised of membrane and sinew, roasted duck primarily fat and bone, undrinkable over-priced Chianti Clasico(screw-on top?)
Waiter all but demanded a 33% tip
which she didn't get
She didn't make the food but she was rarely seen
Surprisingly, the desserts were excellent
I threw a birthday dinner on Friday night at 8pm for about 13 people
The beautiful blonde hostess was extremely friendly to us (despite the crowds of people waiting for tables outside), the service was quick and efficient, the food was excellent (nothing cold!), and the manager was very very accomodating
The tab was about $650, which included an appetizer and entree for each person and 4 bottles of wine for all of us
The manager even threw in a huge home-made birthday cake for all of us

If you want the corporate restaurant, you bring 'em, we sling 'em


go to olive garden
You won't get that at Angelo's
When you go to Angelo's expect to wait, it's well worth it
Anyone who's spent any amount of time on the mediteranean sea will notice that the clock works very differently there
If you can have a drink and chat with some folks at the bar, go, you'll love it
A friend from out of town and I ate there in early December
We were delighted when a small, marching band (really) bumped and elbowed their way into the restaurant
They played for about 15 minutes and it made our night
Not to mention the lobster ravioli is the best meal I have ever shoveled into my mouth
A coworker and myself went there
It was my first time eating in Litttle Italy and all the other establishments were empty
but Angelo's was packed
The pasta is fresh the sauce is great
Great selection of wine
Service was friendly and inviting
Portions are filling
I will return
Angelos use to be a better place however, it's changed
The food is not as good as previous years
This restaurant was definetly not worth it!! The food was awful extremely overpriced and the service was dreadfull
You are better off going to DaNico, the food is great with the service to match!! Save your money and skip Angelo's
Noisy,crowded, reservations with a 20 sometimes work give 1/2 and promise the rest when seated
The back looks and feels like a suburban pizza parlor
The pasta is wonderful and the southern cooking is up there, nothing fancy thank goodness
the service at this home away from home was more like a scene from the movie Oliver
Everything had to be asked for including water, bread, and even silverware
The busboys and waiters acted like they were Judge Smails and i was lucky to be allowed in their presence
the food was acceptable, but with a hundred other restaurants within a stones throw you would think that rudeness is not a profitable or desirable way to distinguish oneself
The maitre'd doesn't realize that he's in the service business!! A party of 10, we arrived on time for our 6PM reservation to learn that he knew nothing of it
Apparently calling us a week prior to confirm (they called us!!!!) threw them off - he claimed we weren't in the book! And then refused to show us the book
Hmmm
Anyway, having eaten there once before, I know that I wasn't missing all that much
Food is average, service is awful, and the attitude isn't New York - it's just plain rude - and most of NYC is caring and courteous
Too many better restaurants - do yourself a favor and go anywhere else
Celebrating what? 100 years of bad service?? We had reservations at 7:00 and ended up leaving at 8:00 without getting seated
Meanwhile groups of 6 were walking past us at the bar and getting seated
Go figure
Rude, rude, rude
Don't bother
The worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in NYC--and I had out-of-town guests with me
They were appalled
We made a reservation, most of us came on time, yet metrde had crossed us out of reservations, was extremely rude to my friends who came a little early, and refused to give us a table
Then he proceeded to sit people that came after us
We waited 30 minutes hoping to get a table
I finally succeeded in catching his attention and he told me that we were late and he does not know if he can sit us
So we went across the street and had a nice meal without the attitude
Food always! being served hot
Gnochi's my wife kills for
All my european friends LOVE! this joint
Service always excellent and friendly and always the same guys
Nobody beats their sauces!!!!
This place is just the best
Been going for over 15 years and it is one of my favorites
I eat out all the time in NYC and Angelos is just the best
Don't forget the fried zucchini and say hello to the host Antoine
This is hands down the best Italian food in Little Italy
Why do you think it's been there over 100 years? Granted, it can get crowded and service may not make you feel special your first time out, but one has to have patience with the waiters who have obviously been there for a long time themselves
Develop a relationship with these guys and I think you will become a regular yourself
I first went to Angelo's in July
I am returning on November 8, 2002 with four fiends
I can hardly wait
Mmm good!
I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner based on the rave reviews
There are too many things wrong with this restaurant to name
Waiting an hour and a half with reservations, while we could plainly hear the host say to regulars strolling in No reservations? No problem! This way! The food, which was drab and of which, even the Olive Garden supercedes
The service, which was horrendous - they charged us for two appetizers when we asked to split one (when we brought it up, he insisted that the appetizer really did only consist of 2 sliced tomatoes and 1 slice of cheese)
After leaving him with a reasonable 12% tip for the horrible service, he ran after us screaming through the restaurant
One word of advice: avoid this place in droves
This is a nice restaurant
The food is good, but I wasn't blown away
For the price, I guess I was hoping for better
A friend who's been going to Angelo's for years introduced me to the place last year
Everything in the place is authentic Italian-- from the fabulous food to the waiters and hosts with their charming Italian accents
My two favorites are the Baked Clams and the Veal Piccata but everything is good
Angelo's is one of my favorite restaurants and I can't wait to go back!
The most AWESOME lobster ravioli in the world! I've been ruined
I can't eat Italian food anywhere now because it just doesn't compare to Angelo's
It is delicious! And, the Italian waiters aren't bad either!! ;-)
The food was ok, I didnt really like the slow service
It is usually crowded
Sorry, kids
This place just 'aint cutting it
I just had dinner at Angelo's and the food was mediocre, the service was downright awful, and I couldn't even hear myself talk, it was so loud
And that was on a thursday night, not their most busy evening
Just another lousy sauce joint for bridge and tunnel tourists who wouldn't know a good italian meal if it leapt off the plate and bit them on the nose
The Mussels in white wine appetizer was fantastic! The best I've had
The lobster ravioli was flavorful, and the shrimp and clams were impressive, with large, plump shrimp
Overall, this place has great food
The wait was about 45 minutes on Sat night
Be sure and position yourself very accessibly within the restaurant while waiting, and make as much eye contact as possible with the host, as they don't have a wait list to add your name to
They prefer to use a 'mental' wait list
very good (try the Angelo's seafood mix (on the menu (shrimp, clams, mussels etc
) the Merlot wine is excellent!
The best Calamari and Red Wine in the World
The restaurant setting gives you the since that you are actually in Italy
One of my favorite restaurants in the city- the food is excellent! It is a little tough to get a table on the weekends and it is definelty who you know, as a lot of 'regulars' frequent and seem to get a table a little easier
But- the food is excellent, it is worth the wait

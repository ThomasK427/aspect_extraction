Amist the plethora of food choices on 9th Ave, the Eatery is a true gem
Unlike most resturants in the city, the Eatery transforms itself seamlessly from a lunch/brunch spot to a nocturnal locale
It's impossible to walk past this lively establishment without feeling its pulse
The Eatery attracts everyone from multigenerational families to hot young couples (with the occasional celeb sighting)
The wait staff is upbeat, attentive, and knowledgeable
As for the food, the bannana, chocolate, and cream cheese stuffed french toast will cure any hangover
The mac and jack is a deliciously cheesy new take on a classic American dish that will satisfy any appetite
At dinner prepare yourself for the wok flashed tequilla shrimp, the perfect mix of fried goodness with seafood bliss
The Eatery truly offers something for everyone
I had brunch here for Father's Day
The service was terrible
The waitress had an attitude after I politely asked for a glass of ice for my luke warm carrot juice
She forgot, so I asked her again, again, and again
I finally asked the bussboy and he brought it over
I had the Japanese Egg White omlet
It was average, lacked something
I really expected better service since Vynl and El Centro (all affiliated restaurants) always have great food and service
I would not go back again
I recently was advised to try a local hot spot in Hell's Kitchen- Eatery Restaurant on 9th and 53rd
I was pleasantly surprised to see that this local hangout had amazing food and equally as impressive service
The decor and atmosphere were comfortable and contemporary
The service was outstanding and friendly(our server took the time to explain every menu item we had questions on, and even took time to direct us to some local bars to head to after the meal), and the food was to die for
My date and I both started with the Grilled Asian Chicken Salad (on the recommendation of our server) which was a delicious and creative take on pan asian cuisine, I especially liked the fried eggroll skin in the salad
For an entree, I tried the Ravioli, cooked to perfection and stuffed with eggplant, ricotta, and chicken and served in an suculent sage butter sauce
My date had another asian dish, the Peking Chicken, served with a black sticky rice that I found extemely unique and flavorful! For dessert we shared a dish of Chocolate Bannana Spring Rolls which was the perfect end to out already outstanding meal
While we didn't have anything off the extensive wine list, I had a watermelontini (with a watermelon wedge in the drink) and my date had the lavender saketini
I will certainly be making Eatery one of my main haunts now, and have been telling everyone about what a great experience I had there
Eatery is always busy, day and night not only because the food is so good but the service is the best on 9th ave
I am always greeated by happy people who take great care in what they are doing no matter how busy this place gets
I just had brunch and I told the manager Ayman that my friends and I had another great time and he suggested that I write a review
You guys rock! Jed
You guys are the best; the asian chicken salad should have a warning label like cigarettes because I think it is more addictive
I need my fix way to often
I had the shrimp for dinner last night and it did not disappoint
I also had about a dozen sangrias which went down way to easy
I order from eatery 3 or 4 times a week from work an still find myself coming here on the weekends for brunch and dinner
I have had very few bad experiences at eatery over the years and they are alwqays very helpful to any problem
I wish the restaurants in my hood were as good
It's classy
It's fun
It's affordable
The food is damn good, too
For all those reasons The Eatery is my number one dining spot in the city
I take everyone there: first dates, family, business associates and friends visiting NYC
The classy and simple decor of sage green booths and fresh flowers calms the mind and the friendly, knowlegable and handsome waitstaff serve up beautiful appetizers and entrees
You must try the mac n' jack: it's to die for
And the new Kiwitini is a delight! I am headed there this afternoon, in fact
I always wanted to try and I was a little scared to do it due to some bad reviews
I haven't been there for brunch so I can only give my opinion in terms of dinner
We were a party of 4 so we more less touched a few plates of the menu
The tuna tartar was delicious, a great appetizer
The salads were also really good
I ordered the steak and was not only tasty but also perfectly cooked
The maccheese were really good as well
I went there with my boyfriend for what we hoped would be a nice brunch
What a disappointment
Food was horrible, tasteless and old, after we return it the manager came up to our table and said that he wouldnt eat it either
While I don't travel much north of 23rd, Eatery will definitely change that
The cran-apple martinis is flawless
Be certain you compliment the salmon club with a side of fries, both are mouth-watering excellent
My friend's favorite plate will always be ravioli, reportedly an orgasmic feeling with your first byte
ive come here for numerous brunch and dinners and ive always been satisfied
the e-benne, eaterys version of eggs benedict, is served on potato cake which is a good alternative to the regular english muffin
omelettes are fluffy and light the Japanese egg white omelette is an especially fresh healthy alternative
at dinner, chipotle meatloaf on buttery mashed potatoes is both flavourful and comforting
mac n cheese is satisfying but not memorable
desserts (~$7) are large and easily sharable (the banana cheesecake is especially good)
dinner usually ranges from $50-$65 (no alcohol) for 2 ppl, which is reasonable
service is adequate though not commendable since its hard to get a servers attention
wait for a table can be long (especially at brunch)
iced tea is strangely murky so steer clear! eatery is my favourite of the trio of 9th avenue comfort restaurants which include vynl julians
Granted, I live downtown where there are zillions of restaurants turning out well prepared inexpensive food, but I'm not sure what all these rave reviews are about
It was just ok
And just barely
The top layer of my adobo salad was nice enough, but just below the surface it began to swim in a cloyingly sweet dressing, so that it became like some weird melted jello concoction
I gave up and tried my companion's mac and cheese, which, again, was delicious for the first few bites
But was very rich and would have been well-served by an accompanying side salad to periodically cleanse the palate
The service was ok, but a little spacey
And it was loud
Much, much too loud
Not terrible, not great, definitely not a destination
Whenever I have friends visiting NYC I make a reservation for dinner at Eatery
and here's why! The food is creative yet homey (meatloaf better than mom used to make), gourmet yet unintimidating (the tequila shrimp with flautas), and very reasonably priced
It's a true NY experience between the food, the fantastic drink menu (the cranapple martini is always a winner), and the ambiance
The staff knows their stuff and is always willing to answer questions and go above and beyond to make sure that you have a great time
On Wednesday nights, there's even a DJ spinning at the bar! My out of town guests are always impressed and never disappointed
Finish it off with the warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream, and you'll have to roll yourself out the front door!
This restaurant is a really cute date spot-dimly lit with little candles
Close to midtown-without all the tourists
Our hip, friendly waiter suggested their cranapple martinis
They were delicious-we had two each! We started with the ginger calamari
It was fried, but not too heavy, and the sauce was interesting
Very tasty! Then, we both tried the Adobe salad, which was delicious
The combination of the bacon and beans and cheese and tortillas was hearty, yet I still felt somewhat healthy because it had tons of greens
Finally, we tried the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream
The cake was by far our favorite! With it's molten center that oozed in your mouth, it was a very sexy cake
In fact, I think it was quite the aphrodisiac! Overall, everything was great, and, well, if this guy doesn't work out, at least I found a new date spot in midtown!
I Have tried Eatery now a few times and am falling in love with this local hotspot
It doesn't matter what I order it all seems to be outstanding
The service is not only on point and friendly, but I have never got food faster at any other restaurant

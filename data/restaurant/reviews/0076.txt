The regular pizza has a nice thin crispy crust
Tell them to burn it, for a extra crispy cruist
And of course the Spumoni is the BEST IN THE WORLD bar none! Can not be duplicated
And don't forget to be on the lookout for some of Brooklyn's famous wise guys
Theyb are the real thing
ive been going here all my life and ive never tried the regular pies
every time ive gone ive gotten sicilian and never been disappointed
my opinion would be this is the best pizza in new york
YOU NEVER KNWO WHO IS GOIN TO BE THERE
STOP BY AND TRY IT
LB is the best for squares definitly
I travel back to Brooklyn to CT just for it!
Everything about this restaurant is pleasing (with the exception of the long wait for the restaurant)
Their sicilian pizza cannot be beat and I ALWAYS take home a couple of squares for my freezer
I moved away from that neighborhood ten years ago, but still make it my business to get there at least once a week and as soon as we sink our teeth into that slice, we (my friend and I) simultaneously say MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! I hope they never change their recipe!
Hands down the Best Sicilian Pizza in town
They're thin crust is not to shabby either
I can only speak about the Sicilian(square) pizza here, that is my favorite
Yes parking can be a problem at times but that's because so many people feel the same way I do about their Square pizza
Double parking is the norm here
For me the only negative thing to say about LB is that I live 70 miles away
THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK
AND THE SPUMONI IS UNREAL
IF YOUR IN NY AND WANT GREAT PIZZA GO THERE IT'S WORTH THE TRIP
Just sitting here typing in my review my mouth begins watering for the famous squares of L B Spumoni Gardens!
There is no better Pizza in the world than LB's square
It is worth the trip from Long Island into Brooklyn for
An experience on a Sunday in the Summer around 6:00 p
m
listening to Brooklyn's own Joe Causi and eating LB in a massive crowd
Defines 86th Street
Everything about the pizza is awesome
This is my neighborhood pizzeria, although I live miles away, it is worth the trip every time
They make sicillians only, and put the cheese under the sauce which is unique and allows the cheese to stay in place
Its made consistently so you never get a slice, pie, or half pie which has been sitting around
The guys behind the counter are not only friendly, but funny, and will go out of their way to make sure your visit was fun
No wonder they've been there for ever!, and don't forget the Totoni :)
The best pizza, sicilian or regular
The gelato is out of this world
At LB you feel right at home
They have home made spumoni which tastes like a dream
Their Sicilian style pizza is one of a kind, I know people from across the country that come to have this pizza
One Entree from their restaraunt is enough to fill two adults, not to mention that all their dishes are out of this world
The important thing is that LB Spumoni Gardens is extremely reasonably priced
It is hard to eat pizza anywhere else once you eaten here
In the summer this place is packed and there is out door seating available
everything is delicious, it doesn't matter what you order! come on down!!!
This pizza USED to be GREAT about 10 years ago and when I went back recently I was very dissappointed
The red sauce had no flavor, the cheese lacked that fresh quality cheese taste you expect from a well-known pizzaria, and the slice overall was really dry
Would go to Lenny Johns Pizzaria on Flatbush Ave and Flatlands Ave over this place now anyday
Now thats good Brooklyn pizza!
Found this place while riding my bike back from Coney Island
Their pizza is unique and tasty
Cheap and fast
Outdoor seating taps it off
Fun place to go for quick food
The perfect end to a day at the beach is a Trip to LB Spumoni gardens
WHile their round Napolitan pizza is good, it is nothing compare to their square Sicilian pie
For best results order Half a tray, that's 12 slices of a 24 slice slab of Pizza perfection
The cheese is covered in sauce and hard to see but not hard to taste
The sauce has a lemony olivey taste and the crust has the right mix of chewey and crunchy textures
Absolutely, Hands down, the best sqaure pizza in the world
Doesn't everybody know this?
For the most part the square pizza is only one reason to visit this establishment
During the summer the seating is mainly in the outdoor garden with a resturant indoors
The Italian food is quite mundane an the Ices are a nice touch
SQUARE PIZZA AT IT'S BEST
LOTS OF SAUCE AND JUST A TOUCH OF CHEESE MAKE THIS PIZZA QUITE UNIQUE
A BROOKLYN LANDMARK FOR MANY YEARS: WONDERFUL ON A SUMMER NIGHT
TRY TO GET INTO THE RESTAURANT ON A SUMMER WEEKEND
GOOD LUCK
WE HAD TO WAIT ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
TOO LONG, BUT IF YOU HAVE TIME, WORTH THE WAIT
does not have any fancy pizzas just the basic , always served fresh out of the oven, never had reheated pizza
I've lived in Brooklyn all my life
I travel all around the city daily
I have been to pizza places all across the eastern seaboard, LA, Chicago, and there is nothing like L B's!!!! It's like having the goodfellas and meet with the pope - it's just rare! You can't find pizza, ladies gentleman, and that old school Brooklyn attitude (when everyone knew each other) anywhere else anymore
The square slkices are the best and for dessert i recommend some spumoni or soft ice cream on a cone! If you're really looking to gain some weight, go for a napalotano slice, a sicilian slice, and banana split to top it off!
I like the seating and the service is excellent and their pizza is suberb so is their spumoni
overall excellent
Very well known, went there as a kid since I only lived a couple of blocks away, for some reason the pizza doesn't taste quite as good as it used to, though everything there is still good
The pizza is the best
The service is fast and friendly
The portions are huge!!!! My favorite is the Seafood salad!
This place is pizza
The square pizza is unparalleled anywhere else on this earth
The spumoni is also first rate here
Although I no longer live in Brooklyn, whenever I make the trek the family always requests a stop off at LB
During the summer the outdoor area is a great place to sit and eat you pizza
Just make sure you end it all with some spumoni!
This place has the best squares i ever had
It also has great ice cream and spumoni ices
Great pizza, good food, great atmosphere
The cool breeze from the nearby Coney Island is the perfect A/C for the outdoor dining
Don't miss the spumoni!
The pizza is thet always fresh and just made they hav an outdoor seating area that is partially covered they also have a full service restaurant on the premises they make everything on premises
Montes IS Italian food
As most of Bay Ridge and Brooklyn in general is undergoing a Yuppization and is looking more like the trendy nothingness of SOHO
Montes is an GOOD ol Fashioned standard, and exemplifies what Italian dining in Brooklyn is really about
Forget the phony yuppies of Areos and The Pearl Room, and ENJOY the down home service and OUTSTANDING food here

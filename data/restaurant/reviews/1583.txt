Talk about cute waitresses, Duke's serves up some good grub and cheap PBR in a can all while looking at some of the cutest girls in the big apple  Thanks Dukes
If you like playing a little trivia, your gonna love dukes
dropped by last tuesday night for some ribs and found out it was Trivia Tuesday! played a few games with the entire place, lot of laughs and a really good time
Food was great as usual but the trivia game was a nice change of pace
They even gave out prizes and had guys chugging beers as a tie breaker
My husband and I came here on our anniversary, after having a strong craving for BBQ we set out to find a nice BBQ spot in the Union Square district, where we were also seeing a theatre performance
We were sadly disappointed in the food
The ribs were seasoned with some kind of sauce that did not even taste like BBQ sauce, the collard greens were not even cut they were cooked whole and they were seasoned with celantro and other spanish seasonings instead of southern seasonings, and last but not least the Macaroni cheese also left alot to be desired, it was bland
Good food at tolerable prices, but stay away from the jambalaya
It's half the size it used to be but still costs $11

Order it for your 11-year old son, but make sure to also get him an appetizer because it's not filling
I thought this place was simple and down to earth
The food was great
Try the pulled pork, fried chicken, and the spinach artichoke dip! Also, the mac cheese was one of the best in the city! It was crowded, festive, and full of laughter
If you are looking for a place to watch games, catch up with some friends, or just have great time
this place is it!

Pulled Pork! The scene is very low key and the food is excellent
I would recommend the Pulled Pork sandwich, the chili, the brisket and the salads
Also a fun bar scene when there is a big game on!
Intent on finding good southern food and BBQ in NYC, I headed to Dukes
Unfortunately the instant whipped potatoes, dry babyback ribs, and cumin flavored collard greens did not have southern or BBQ written on them at all
Sorry guys and gals but babybacks just don't fly in BBQ country!
They've got lots of TVs for sports viewing and lots of cute waitresses/bartenders for some more eye candy
Some of the waitresses are bitter from having the guy constantly hit on them but
overall, its a great crowd
Foods good (not great) and the beer is good too
I would recommend this place
My husband and I go to Duke's for brunch every Sunday and it really is the best kept secret in NYC
The food is great, games are always on and the staff is so friendly
Try the eggs benedict
My favorite!!
We always have agreat time at Duke's, They have great food but the best part is the amazing Kristen!!! She really is the hottest and coolest!!! I highly recomend going just to hang out with her! We love you Kristen!!!!!!
We've been for dinner and brunch
Dinner is ok, the food is what you expect, the service is pretty slow, so don't wait until you're starving to go
the long wait may also be a problem
For brunch, skip it
The food is the same as or even a little worse than your corner diner but the prices are twice as high and the service was awful
we waited forever for drinks, were never given utensils, and didn't get what we ordered
All in all a disappointing place
Great bar - always fun, best wings in the city, and Kristen is the coolest, sexiest waitress in NYC
Well
food, that is
It looks feels like a place you'd expect to be called Duke's
Minus the sawdust, the place has been a great standard for me the buds, hanging out for lunch or a low-keyed dinner
Great burgers, done just the way you want 'em
Decent beer selection
Try the calamari, too: you won't regret it
Plus, you get four screens around you of news, sports, etc
All-in-all: great comfort food and a decent price!
This is a great spot for a group to fill up on good southern food and a variety of beers without breaking the bank
Great (if kitschy) atmosphere and friendly (if a little slow) staff
The food is great, and tasty
I always get the Old Kentucky Club
I recommend the mashed sweet potatoes as well, you can't go wrong here
Duke's is the best burger bar around
Their yummy calamari dipping sauce is second to none!! Service is fast, drinks are cold, and you leave with a big belly!
Everyone at this place is nice
Everyone you speak with is having a good time
The people working there are extremely friendly
You can hang out with a bunch of your closest buddies and - oh yea, the food is great too
Great comfort food and surprisingly good service
This place gets packed with the afterwork crowd
I love this place - huge salads and sandwiches, the perfect comfort food at great prices
Everything is deep-fried here at Duke's, with the exception of liquids and lettuce, and you get the impression they'd fry that too if they could sell it
Sometimes, though, fried stuff tastes sooooo good, and this is the place to get it
Just know your limit or you'll leave with a bellyache
I first ate at Burritoville over 8 years ago and have been coming back religiously ever since
The service has always been good and I've rarely ever been disappointed with the food
Great selection for any variety of tastes and moods
Lots of free options for customizing burritos
Free chips and salsa when eating in
Filling, fresh and delicious food, daily/weekly specials, and I don't think anything on the menu is over $8
This place is so good, very fast, and cheap! Who could not love good, fast, cheap mexican food!? It is always fresh and healthy
The menu has a great selection and lots of good substitutes
Love the free chips and be sure to try the green salsa!
Gotta try the Mega-Soy, Lost in Austin and Mystical Frisco (Beef) Burritos
Also - GREAT Chicken taquitos
A real bargain - and plenty of good food
Sushi was just so-so
Special rolls are not special except for a couple
I loved the ikamaru however
They offer a lot of special rolls
Not so special except for a few
They don't even have red snapper, fluke or uni
Definitely not the place for the adventurous sushi lover
Since our first visit there just after they opened a few years ago, Ginger has been our favorite restaurant
The dishes are inventive and fun but rely on basic good quality: consistently fresh ingredients, huge butter-like sushi/sashimi cuts, and reasonable prices
The service is wonderfully unpretentious and familial
Though the menu includes some unorthodox offerings (a peanut butter roll, for instance), the classics are pure and great--we've never had better sushi anywhere, including Japan
And do have fun with the funky rolls and appetizers--we especially recommend the White Tuna Sashimi (with a wasabi sauce), Crispy Tuna Tartare, and Dynamite appetizers; the Triple Don main dish; and friends who are sukiyaki connoisseurs said that Ginger's is one of the best they've had
If you make a reservation for a less-crowded week night, Ginger is a great place to bring a group
We've enjoyed more than a few mirthful birthday gatherings there
I don't understand why this place has gotten so many great reviews
I was very disappointed that their sushi was far below average
wasn't pretty, wasn't fresh, wasnt tasty
True, Ginger is inexpensive, the service was friendly and they make some unique rolls, but personally I rather visit my grocery and get even cheaper sushi of similar or better quality
Ginger is tiny, so don't go in a big group, but definitely come with a big appetite
The rolls are so creative and combine flavors you never would have thought go together well, but totally do

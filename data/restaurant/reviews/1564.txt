Be aware this place is pricey
I have been going to Knickerbockers for 15 years for brunch and dinner and have never had a bad experience
The ambience is a homey neighborhood restaurant that is cool without trying to be trendy
Regulars have been coming here for years and know all of the waitstaff by name
Be sure to request a booth when making a reservation and definitely get the steak
Unlike most places, the steak can be ordered for 1-4 people and comes with creamed spinach and a choice of potato (get the garlic mashed)
Their drinks are great from bloody marys to martinis-they really know how it should be made
MY OLD HANG OUT HAS CHANGED, FOR THE BETTER
NEW, HIPPER LOOK
BEAUTIFUL CHERRYWOOD TABLES,MORE COMFORTABLE FEEL
THE MUSIC IS STILL GREAT
SAME STAFF FROM YEARS AGO, MAKE IT VERY COMFORTABLE
WE HAD THE T BONE, GOOD AS LUGERS, EVEN BIGGER AND CHEAPER
I HAD FOIE GRAS ON AN APPLE TART, TOO DIE FOR
WE SHARED A BEET SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE
I HAD THE CRABMEAT LASAGNA WITH A GINGER BUTTER SAUCE, THIS WAS NOT YOUR GRANDMAS LASAGNA, LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MADE TO ORDER
FOR DESSERT WE HAD, I THINK ITS THE BEST AROUND, CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE
I ASK MY WAITRESS HOW IT IS MADE, AND SHE SAID THE KEY IS VALROHNA CHOCOLATE
IT WAS AS GOOD A MEAL AS I'VE EVER HAD, ANYWHERE
MY HUSBAND JUST REMINDED ME ABOUT THE WINE, CHAULK HILL CAB
FOR $60, HE SAYS ITS A STEAL
IT WAS WELL WORTH THE VISIT BACK THERE, CHEERS!
Terrible service! No one should be treated like this when they are a customer!  We were a party of 6 women
We were treated poorly from the moment we walked in the door
The concierge (who called himself the manager) was rude and disrespectful
We left this restaurant after this person continued to harass us in front of a full room of diners
i've dined at the restaurant a few times and the experience was so so, however the last time i was there i was amazed at how pompus the staff was
during dinner i left to go to the restroom and the bus boy just happend to spill a full glass of red wine all over the table, my chair, and my lamb skin gucci bag
i believe the manager said, hey accidents happen
his face turned bright red and obviously didn't know how to handle the situation
we had to pay for the entire dinner (including the spilled wine) and i had to wait about 2 1/2 months to get the bag dry cleaned
the owners and the managers need to learn how to run a business
Like an old standard, the Knick never disapoints
Even if you mised the cameo in some poular movies, you'll appreciate the Hirschfelds (pencil drawing that hide the artist's daughter's name Nina, over and over again) and the great live Jazz
They have found the magical combination of live dinner music that is both enjoyable and unobtrusive
It's a treat to sit at the bar, or to cozy up with a small grou in those round leather booths
the chocolate souffle is a MUST!
I love the coziness, camaraderie and ambiance of eating at the bar, and the Knick is hands down the best dining-at-the bar place in this town
I HAVE BEEN TO THE KNICK MANY TIMES AND ITS ALWAYS GREAT
I RECENTLY WENT AND I LOVE THEIR NEW LOOK
GREAT LOOKING CHERRY WOOD TABLES, REALLY GO WELL FOR THIS STEAKHOUSE
I ACTUALLY FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITHOUT THE WHITE TABLECLOTHS
LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE JAZZ IS ONLY ON FRI
SAT
, BUT I'LL LIVE
LOVE THIS PLACE, ALWAYS FEELS LIKE HOME
This was a hit of a restaurant for our group
Great T-Bone!!! Highly recommended
Atmosphere was excellent, as was the live music
Service was a bit slow, but we didn't mind as we had the music to listen to
Would not recommend the Ahi Tuna appetizer
Highly recommended overall
Great selection of entrees and a nice wine list!
Came recommended to us, but we found the food to be so-so, the service good, but we were told we could not order desert since the table we were at had a reservation waiting
Like that wes our fault
No much of a value to this experienced diner
a superb place! i've been coming here for years since the early 80's
great jazz that never disappoints and great steaks and side dishes
also good seafood try the grilled halibut, the appetizers are awesome too if you just want to hang out in the bar
this is a classic New York place, let's hope it stays around forever!
Two twentysomethings treated a friend who is leaving the working world for law school to a nice meal
Habitues (via parents) of the KBG for many years, we reserved a table
Two yummy starters, two bottles of wine and two execrable entrees later ('medium rare' steak burned outside, gray within, INEDIBLE ribs so packed with gristle that they were -a lifetime first-) we thanked the waitress, paid the bill (not including the ribs, thankfully) for a $70 steak and music charge, gave generous tip and asked to see the manager
He said that we were intoxicated (how can you contest that?), that the meat 'always comes from the same supplier,' never apologized for the ruined celebration, and finally kicked us out, saying he did not need patrons like us
At least two longtime customers with expense accounts, lost forever
We don't dine where we have been treated so shamefully
Our dinner took over two hours because of the slow service
Since we didn't get the check until after the live music had played for 15 minutes, our bill included a music charge per person
The fine print on the menu says all people who are still seated at a certain time will be charged
An institution in the West Village, Knockerbocker is one of those restaurants where you can either have the meal of your dreams or the meal from hell
Last night, I had the most delicious pork chops
My dining companion had a steak with so much fat on it that he had to send back it
The service is great, the prices are very fair, and the restaurant is a throw back to old gentlemen's clubs
Most of the diners are elderly
Hip it ain't, but I do return from time to time with mixed results
I've been a fan of this place since I came to NYC years ago
Excellent service for each visit
I highly recommend the smoked salmon and caesar's salad, as well as caviar pie!! The famous T-bone steak is also quite a taste
If you 're going in a group don't order the bigger portions-1) too difficult to have it cooked the way you want it 2) the bigger the portion, the smaller each person will get
So, every 2 ppl
should get a T-bone for one, not all 4 of you getting T-bone for 4
Trust me, it's a huge difference
Also their chocolate souffle is not bad at all
I wouldn't try their pasta though, it's not so good
Other dishes that I didn't mentions are rather inconsistent in quality
ALWAYS dependable
Ambiance, Service, and food
We have been there dozens of times and it never misses
No matter who we bring with us, they are impressed
Even New Years Eve was perfect
Everything on the menu is just right and one of the best steaks in town
Knickerbocker is a jewel of a restaurant
Hope they never find out how much they could actually charge for their food! A Great - Dependable place to dine and enjoy good Jazz!
Easier to get to and easier for most to get into than Peter Luger and though there's no Luger steak sauce, the meat is comparable
Enormous portions, so steak for one is ample for two
It's cooked to perfection, served sliced on the bone in sizzling pan
Accompanied by variety of wonderful potatoes and creamed spinach
Added perk is you're not limited to steak house side dishes, so you can get a superb caesar salad, many other choices to go with your steak
Large menu is sure to please non-meat eaters also
There is usually (or maybe always) live music starting at 9pm

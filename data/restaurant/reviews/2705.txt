you ever eat somthing and a few days later you find yourself inexorably drawn to its point of origin such is the case with india houses goat roti @ 3

In Short Junior's is a beloved destination for dessert hounds, nostalgia trippers and visitors to the Brooklyn Academy of Music
The famous cheesecake--for sale in a wide array of flavors and sizes in the front bakery, and for consumption in the sprawling orange-and-wood retro interior--is made fresh daily
The deli-diner-soul-food menu, featuring everything from matzo balls to barbecued chicken and ribs to 10-ounce burgers, is available until late
Breakfast draws a downtown Brooklyn business crowd
Overrated
Tourist trap
Unfulfilling portions of decent food, but not good enough to be worth the exorbitant price
The hostess was nasty and presumptous
Even the cheesecake was not the best I've ever had
The waitresses were pleasant, but I can't think of anything else good to say about my experiences at Junior's
This diner is a calorie counters nightmare
It's nearly impossible to pass this establishment without noticing the delectable desserts in their window
Only the most stalwart vegans and dieticians could look at these delights without salivating
Let there be no doubt, this place needs no reviews
Its reputation for serving the most dense delicious cheesecake in New York City proceeds it
Among others they have served presidents, statesmen and celebrities and for a somewhat pricey fee they will serve you the best strawberry, pineapple or naked cheesecake in Kings County
Their chocolate cake and lemon meringue pie is nothing to sneeze at either although, it is not what Juniors is known for
Their matzo ball soup isnt bad, it was good
Nothing to rave about but you dont go to Juniors for their soup
Their only competition cheesecake wise is the Stagedoor Deli and Carnegie Deli
The chicken tenders, cosala,pickels and more food were the best and the cake was cheap but the food is expensive like 50$ and 80$ for 6 people
Overall ,food,ambience,service were the best and highly reccomended ever
and much much better than the grand central one
The pastrami here is good and the cake was ok
I'm a poor starving artist, so a $40 - $50 bill at Juniors (for sodas, appetizer, dinner, and dessert for 2) is a little much, especially since it's a very diner type atmosphere
However, the food is very good and the cheesecake is awesome (and they even have sugar free!) It's worth it, but I'll probably only go every now and then
The service was very good
Juniors is overrated! The cheesecake I make is better than theirs
Love it, the Cheesecake, that's why I come and that's what I get, just Cheesecake
So if your in NY and specific in Brooklyn stop here and get some piece for yourself, if your in Manhatten you can get some at Grand Central, but you have to try the cheescake
Juniors serve great drinks at a good price
It is my favorite place for cocktails
The bartenders are very friendly
I've been a few times for dinner and dessert and the food is always old-tasting and bland
Never tasty
ONLY the cheesecake is good
Stick with that and a cup of coffee and that's about it
Juniors is open late and is there for you when you need a late night treat, Lunch, late dinner or if you feel like having breakfast in the afternoon (or evening)
I went with my friend from out of town and had a great time
We went at 1 am, we got food, fast service and Excellent drinks
I definiately reccomend Junior's
not only it is it worth the trip for the breakfast but if you like cheesecake you MUST have Junior's once in your life
I've had Junior's cheesecake quite a few times but never the food
I ventured for the first time to sit down for a meal
I was not impressed with the food at all
Nothing exciting or even worth mentioning
Soda was near flat
Prices were high
No cream soda (that's outrageous in a place like Junior's)
For this type of food, I would stick to a Jewish Deli
I mean they served pastrami on two mini onion rolls
The cheesecake is excellent of course
I don't know if the peole who wrote the othe reviews actually ate dinner there because I did and the food was out of this world!! The portions were big, the food was incredible
never mind the best cheesecake in the world
Everyone should go there for dinner
I had the Hungarian Goulash and my boyfriend had the turkey dinner and we both agreed they were the best we ever had!
I've never had a meal here, but I can tell you that Junior's serves up the best (and biggest) portions of cheesecake in Brooklyn, if not the whole city
The egg creams are also really good
You can also order a cheesecake and have Junior's ship it to your chosen lucky recipient; I had one sent to my mom for her birthday several years ago and it was a big hit
Haven't try anything other than cheesecake at this place
This is the only place that has great cheesecake in the Tri State area and they are famous for it
The guy who served me seem a little impatient when i started asking question
But it is indeed very good value for the quality you get
My friend said she tried getting the cake in individual piece at take out and maybe that's been sitting in the fridge for too long, I was told that it doesn't taste good
But I've been getting the whole cake, the 6 one and it's been great
Junios cheesecake might as well be world famous! the selection, choices, richness and deliciousness cannot be outdone! A popular diner in the Metro Tch Brooklyn area catering to local brooklyn ites or the wall street financial back office employees of Metrotech
a real treat! The food offered is great too, more than a typical diner, wortha trip!
I loved it
Bill Clinton ate there
His pic is up soon as you walk in
It's a rather large restaurant that was packed when we went
Despite the fact that it was cold as Antartica in the winter, I enjoyed myself
The waiter we had was acting kinda weird but besides that, everything was great!
The food here is OK--go for brunch if you're going to go for any meal--and you get big portions, but Juniors is all about the cheesecake
It is the best
None other can compare
In Short A warm spirit abounds at this mainstay sports bar and restaurant
Multiple televisions on both sides of the cozy room ensure unobstructed sight lines for fans, whether they're sipping pints at the oak bar or snacking on pub munchies--like baked clams, nachos, and buffalo wings--at tall tables in front
Additional seating in the back and a full menu of salads, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, and steaks, accommodate local families for lunch and dinner
We spent the World Cup at this busy bar/restaurant
Beer after beer, I have never had smoother service - and it was packed
The food seems so-so, although the nachos were really yummy (fake hot cheese w/big cups of beans, chili guac on the side)
The atmosphere is absolutely worth an appetizer and severals drinks
Cody's is one of my top 3 favorite bars in the world
Food's great and cheap, service is friendly, comfortable and casual, and there's ~10 small screens to watch (silent) games on
It's a local bar popular with cops, government workers and older regulars
It does not fit in with the cool bars all over Smith Street
There are ~10 taps with a variety of national and local beers
The ambience is the only downside - wood paneling and bronze everywhere make the place look a little cheesy
The selection on the jukebox is great if you love Irish music and Frank Sinatra
I went here for dinner on a Sunday night
Maybe Sunday is the worst night to go because of football, but this place is far more bar than restaurant
We were seated next to an obnoxiously roudy group of guys, who were extremely rude and loud
When we complained to the owner, he just shrugged us off and offered no compensation for our terrible experience
Awful place for dinner
Just a nitty-gritty good place to eat and have a beer

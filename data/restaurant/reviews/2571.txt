When I am in the mood for great service, great food, great wine and a little romance with my husband we call ahead and go to Cara Mia
Highly Recommend
We had a reservation for three on Friday evening
We told the hostess we had a reservation
She didn't say anything, instead talked to this woman who seemed to be a manager
She said nothing to us and made us stand there for a while
She then told us rudely to move away because we were blocking the entrance
There were 3-4 empty tables enough for us, but she did not want us to be seated
We were kicked out to the cold and waited
It was over 15 minutes past our reservation time, and no one came to get us although there were empty tables
We told the hostess to forget about it
She didn't say a word and just gave us a dirty look
Where is customer service? We will NEVER try to go there again
That is the RUDEST place in Hell's Kitchen!!!
I've been to this restaurant a few times and I know it is a favorite of a few friends
The ambiance is nice, though when busy it's quite cramped
The food is always incredible and they have a great wine list
The eggplant parmesan is the best I've had, ever
My friends and I went here last night for my sister's Birthday dinner
We had read all the reviews before heading out to the restaurant, so we were prepared for anything
Here's what I have to say, the staff was attentive
(Our waiter was fantastic
) The food was better than any Italian food I've ever had
(I had the Rigatoni Pollo Pazzo, my friend had the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana, while the other had the Salmone Alla Griglia
) The dessert was heavenly
(My sister had the profiterolles, a friend had Torta di Cioccolato, and I had the hazlenut gelato from Ciao Bella
) This place came out of a dream
I'll definitely be returning very soon!
I just visited with my family
There were nine of us, and everyone loved their meal
The service was great, and they had a table waiting for us when we arrived (we made reservations a week prior)
I would highly recommend to anyone
It was also very reasonably priced, we had 4 bottles of wine, appetizers, dinner, and coffee and our bill was just over 50 per person
My friend and I were walking along Hell's Kitchen not sure where to eat
Found this place and it was a gem
both of our dishes (I had the penne ala vodka, she had a special) were delicious
they brought us tons of bread and free bruschetta and let us sit and chat for a while after dinner without rushing us
Perfect dining experience
Great atmosphere
We asked for a table by the open window to get a nice breeze and people watch
A great value too
With wine and appetizers, we spent under $60 for two people
Highly recommend
You can't just highly recommend anything
You must be choosy with your praise
I thought Cara Mia was on the cusp of high recommendation, but not quite
The five of us were seated promptly in the back and were more than satisfied with the atmosphere -- the Italian feel, the wine on the walls, etc
My dish, a halibut with risotto, shrimp and mushrooms, was nice but not something I'd order again, although my fiancee's penne dish I would
The lengthy wine list fulfilled our thirst and the bread/bruschetta apps hit the spot early on
Service was prompt and accurate, and in the end, the bill was very reasonable for above-average cuisine
If I were you, I'd give it a shot
It's Italian food at its
second best
which still isn't so bad
I made reservations for 2 people at 7pm on a Thursday night
Got there at 6:55/7 and was told there was a 15 minute wait (even with reservations)
So we waited
and waited
and waited
Very inconsiderate they were
They kept telling us 5 minutes, 2 minutes, 5 minutes
Pretty soon it was 7:45 and we left
This place does not have PROMPT seating if you make reservations
In fact, don't expect to eat at your reserved time
I arrived 15 minutes before my reservation
Decided to wait at a table for my wife since there is no bar
I was ignored completely
So - service? NOT! Then there is the food
Veal saltimbocca, a favorite
The veal was like shoe leather - either cheap or badly overcooked
The spinach underneath was very good
This is dinner? Even though it was only 6 p
m
, if there is a pre-theater menu, you better ASK for it
Mom, sister and I did a weekend in the city - went to a show and ate at Cara Mia immediately following
After a short walk, we were there and seated immediately
The service was wonderful, the food was delicious - great selection (good specials) and the best was the affordable price
When you're in the city, you expect to pay a lot for a good meal, but not in this case! I'd return in a heartbeat!
We went to this restaurant on Feb
13, the day before Valentine's Day
I made reservations about a week in advance, and was so glad we made this choice
It's such a small, quaint place, perfect for a date or a casual dinner
The food was outstanding, he had pasta and I had a veal dish that was to die for
The prices were definitely reasonable, I think we got a lot for our money
I definitely recommend it and plan on going back soon!
had lunch with family: food excellent; nice menu, we shared i tasted items i don't ordinarily like liked them; pleasant, curteous staff - they filled water without my asking once; didn't have everything we asked for,but it's a small gem of a place
metered parking on 9th 10th Ave
My wife and I tried Cara MIA based on the reviews in CitySearch and we were not disappointed
Even though it's maybe 15 feet wide at it's widest point, we were never crowded, always attended to, and had two great meals
We wanted a quite, romantic place for dinner before our broadway show and we got it
We'll go back again
This place is by far the BEST place I have gone out to yet
The food was the BEST! The wine was even better
I took my girlfriend, her mother and two family friends to dinner, and we all loved it
After dinner, dessert, and two bottles of wine, the whole thing only cost me a little over $200! If you are looking for a nice little place with great food, great wine, great service for a great price then look no further
This place is a MUST GO!
Last week was my first time at this restaurant where I brought a date I wanted to impress and it worked like a charm
The ambiance was just what I hoped for and the attentive service made the evening perfect
We had great food and wine, in particular the spinach linguine with the lobster blew my mind
They also have a great wine list and the manager reccomended some wine I never heard before that was just deliscious

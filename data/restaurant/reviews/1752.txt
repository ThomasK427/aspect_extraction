This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
The staff is warm and personable, the atmosphere is relaxing comfortable
Also, it is one of the city's greatest values
The food is solid and hearty
You will not leave hungry
It's just as good for a special event as it is for a spontaneous, low-key, Tuesday night outing
We had a wonderful time
Food was really good and the service was exceptional!! I will be going back
Other reviews are spot on
Quality, low key restaurant with excellent food and service with none of the hype
I would definitely go back again
It's a tad expensive but worth it
This place was so great
a wonderful bar to have a drink before your table is ready, great service and wonderful food
Highly reccomended for dates, out-of-towners, and a great evening out
I will surely be back soon
the red-cat has a very lively, expressive ambience
the staff is casual and friendly, the clientele are the same
there's a nice, long bar to sit at for drinks while you wait for your table, so showing up a little early doesn't leave you elbow to elbow, or standing outside at the mercy of the weather
not much of a wine list, and the menu has no surprises, but it was a solid experience and all three of us had a good time
My girlfiend and I had Thanksgiving dinner at The Red Cat yesterday and everything was wonderful
terrific food and drink, attentive and well-paced service and accommodating and friendly waitstaff
Purr-fection
we will definitely return
Went here with a friend on a Monday night at 7-ish recently
We did not have reservations, but were immediately seated
The restaurant did get crowded later on
Our server was nice and attentive
She was familiar with the menu and the wines
The food was excellent
Great, homey decor
I would definitely go back again
A very relaxing and casual atmosphere, whether eating at the bar 9try the fontina) or at a table
The food is always excellent and the service is great
I had gotten rave reviews from a friend and was dying to go
I took my sister for her birthday and we were very pleased
The food was superb, and the service and the ambience were not far behind
We rated it a '8', just because you've got to hold back a little, right?
After several recommendations from friends, I ate at the Red Cat with my parents
The food was wonderful, the wine list was reasonable and we were seated right away (very important to my parents who HATE to wait for a table)
The appetizers were so delicious and the portions are filling, unlike some of these trendy restaurants who give you 3 scallops and call it an entree
I can't wait to visit again!
A really excellent dining experience
Another great example of a neighborhood place in New York that would be the best restaurant in many other cities
Excellent service, even in the face of a Saturday night slam, inventive dishes, and reasonable prices made for a terrific night out
After hearing many good things, decided to try it for myself and I was not disappointed! I was on my own and the staff could not have been nicer
The wine list is great and reasonable and the food was wonderful
The place was jumping on a Mon nite, as was the bar, but with a nice mixed crowd
Highly recommended!!
I love this place
Low-key restaurant with excellent menu, amazing food, and nice neighborhood, unpretentious feel
Wine list is nice, and be sure to order the dates wrapped in bacon appetizer
Why can't London have a Red Cat! I love this place! We called two days in advance, got the time we wanted, came early and sat at the bar
Very good wine selection
Were seated on time at an intimate table
Other patrons seemed jovial however their conversations were not entirely audible, I like my space when I eat! I loved the arctic char tartare, my date loved the soft shells
on a hot summer night
My goodness, thank God for The Red Cat! My aunt and I were tuttling about chelsea looking at art and falling apart in the heat - when what did we stumble upon! THE most fantastic little place! What a pleasant surprise to have found a restaurant where you can sit at the bar and feel like a glamourpuss, yet whose staff and even other patrons make you feel like you are already a family friend
We had the best time and I highly reccomend anyone to go and it occured to me that one must go on any or all of these occasions: anniversaries, birthdays, girl's night out, or the hottest day of the summer! (the sangria and steak are PHENOMINAL!)
We love to spend the afternoon checking out the galleries but never knew where to have dinner
The Red Cat is like visiting Vermont, barn wood, understated and a little funky
So cool, friendly staff, yummy cocktails
We walked in without a reservation on Saturday at 8pm and they have a walk-in table next to the kitchen but it was perfect
Service was great, food was delicious and I love the space
Always friendly, always delicious, the Red Cat has fresh, American food with lots of surprises
The bar is fun and the crowd is from the neighborhood
It's the best place for dinner after checking out the galleries in Chelsea
The Scene This Meatpacking District icon, which opened in 1868, fits the caricatured ideal of a steakhouse to an almost laughable degree
Men exceed women by a 20-to-1 ratio, black-and-white photos of New York adorn the walls, and waiters consist of a gruff cast of apron-wearing, middle-aged men
The Food The amount of food served at the Old Homestead seems almost suited for an uber-class of human carnivore
Appetizers are huge, bare-bones affairs: a half head of iceberg lettuce drenched in blue cheese, a plate of tomatoes and onions so large they look like they grew in the shadow of a nuclear reactor
The dry-aged steaks run the gamut from an 18-ounce boneless sirloin to a two-pound rib eye to a ferocious-looking $60 porterhouse for two
Settle in with a date, tuck a napkin under your collar, and let the fun begin
Although I grew up in NY, I have never heard of this place until March of 06
I was invited as part of a group and was I ever surprised
The service was top notch, the food was beyond my expectations and, the bill was reasonable considering all we ate and drank
If you enjoy any kind of meat dish, this is the place to go whenin NYC
Make a reservation though, everyone except me seemed to know about this place
I went to Old Homestead on 7/15/06 for dinner with my boyfriend
It was not busy busy because of 7:00pm, but waiters ware so lazy
They waretalking each other
They brught bread in the basket but never brought dish for bread
I had Kansas City Steak and my boyfriend had a steak which was $42
00
Both steaks ware NO taste even any seasoning taste
I felt I was eatign cow, not beef
Most of my boyfriend steak was muscle so that he could not cut
Luckly he could eat only 6 oz meats
Also bad thing was that 2 babies ware next to out table so that I just ate and got out
Only mushroom cup as side dish was great, but we felt we waste money
I DO NOT RECOMEND
You can fnid many better steak house than here in NYC
My girlfriend has been coming here for years, and didn't understand why all the bad reviews, so we decided to check it out again just to make sure
We went during the week, but had a reservation
We were greeted by a hostess who was pleasant, and took us to our table
We had salads, which were excellent (I thought they were a little too fancy), and both had filet mignon
It was the best steak I have had in a long time, only second to Ruth Chris Steak House in Garden City
The waiter was quiet, not rude at all, and seemed that he left us alone to be alone, not because he was too busy
The water glasses were always full as well
Don't be slated by the bad reviews, it may have just been a bad night

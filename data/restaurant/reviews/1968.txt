We sampled almost every tapas on the menu and were quite pleased
Everything at Flor de Sol was good! Not to mention, they have great sangria
I would definitely recommend this place for a serene type setting with good location
cute little place in tribeca with yummy tapas and sangria, great to celebrate with a few friends over a couple of glasses of sangria and some great music!
This is one of my favorite restaurants
I go at least once a week
The waiters are always cute, and friendly and the food is delicious
You must have a pitcher of the sangria with your meal, it gives the food an added zing! The atmosphere is very romantic
The entire place is lite only with candles
It is a very cozy environment
And once a week or so you can have your meal with the sounds of live soothing music playing in the background
although small, the service and food is incredible
Their selection of Tapas is huge, and their entrees are large, delicious portions
The staff is extremely pleasent as well
A must for spanish food lovers or for those who are looking for a change
The extensive choices are sure to please everyones tastes
My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because it looked really nice from the outside
There were a whole slew of waiters working that night but no one seemed to really pay attention or care about us
Their paella was awful, boiled seafood on a bed of rice
unwashed and very dirty mussels, clams scallops
A shrimp dish that was boiled and in a sauce that tasted like unflavored jello
an insult to authentic Spanish cuisine
The Scene  A narrow flight of stairs leads down to a tiny room filled almost entirely with area locals
The service is friendly and efficient--a blessing in such a cramped space--and everything is so clean the place looks like it opened yesterday
The Food  It's a menu full of surprises
House specials include outstanding pork fried buns, flavor-packed dumplings and shredded jellyfish
Hearty congees range from the very tasty pork to broiled frog
The single oddest dish (and it's up against some stiff competition) is a dark-brown, almost-flavorless gelatin served on ice and accompanied by a thick maple-ish syrup
Be sure to order the Tong Shui (sweet soups believed to boost your health in various ways) and the tapioca pearl with coconut milk
Great Dim Sum for 2 for 20 dollars
This place is awesome
Whenever I am in Chinatown, I always go to Sweet-n-Tart
The servers are friendly, the selection is good, the food is tasty, you're served promptly and the prices are cheap
What more could you ask for?
Everything on the menu is a real bargain
The food is better than average
The decor is nice and clean but not very inventive
Their wide variety of freshly blended drinks are great though-everything from Mango to Lychee
They really shine in that department
Great place for dim sum, bubble teas and all at a great value
Try the sugar cane juice - your taste buds will thank you
You know when you go to a place you know and love and can almost taste the food before you get there? Well, I had walked all the way over to Lafayette to get some of that steamed bread at Maria's Bakery but they moved
Unfortunately, I decided to rest my tired feet at the Holiday Inn and try some of the food there
Big mistake
Slow service, annoying loud little kids, rude waiters and the food was simply horrible
I can't imagine anyone voluntarily eating there twice
The service was horrible
I was here for 2 different eventd - a corporation event and a wedding
They were taking the food away before we were finished
The centerpieces were taken away by the restuarant before the wedding started
If you're trapped in the Holiday Inn late at night by circumstance or a cheapskate employer (as was my case) then eat here
Otherwise make the effort to walk somewhere else
The service was very cool and the food not so hot
I travel to NYC from Rhode Island a few times a year for shopping trips and this is the only restaurant we've eaten at for years
Not only is the price great, the food and servive are also top notch
I've never gotten stuck here on anything
They treat my friends and I like queens when we eat there
I'll be there next week to celebrate my 40th
Here's to you Mario and Willy
Cheers
We walked right in and got a table for three on a Saturday evening, despite the fact there appeared to be a birthday party on the first floor
It was very busy, so the wait staff took a few minutes, but not so much time as to irritate us
We ordered the rigatoni alla vodka, the broccoli sauteed in garlic and olive oil, and the potato broquettes, as well as a bottle of Merlot
everything was delicious
If you know about real Italian food go for Positano,I went there with my familly and the food was excellent;but the pasta was the Winner!
We had this Capelline with Shrimps Asparagus al Pesto and Penne with Salmon Shrimp (Thumbs up for the Chef in the Pastas)
But don't try to make a reservation on Saturdays that doesn't help,you have to wait in line
get a table,relax,eat,drink and be happy!
Definitely sit on the Mezzanine
you will not be cramped, as those sitted on the first level were
The food was decent
Lobster Ravioli was good, Salmon with vodka cream sauce had lots of onions which was not mentioned on the menu
Reasonably priced, but don't be fooled, as they charge $3 to add pasta to your chicken dishes
Okay, forget the negative, Positano is the best value in Little Italy
I've been going there for years, ask for Willie, he's the best waiter! Then simply enjoy a great meal in a nice cozy place
No frills, just a great place to relax and eat, drink and be merry!
Horrible waitstaff killed my appetite
Waiter did not get our order correct and was rude about it when I told him so
Would not suggest this place to anyone
Positano is a good place to go for decent Italian food and a more or less pleasant waitstaff, but don't try to make a reservation
They will definitely take your reservation to get you into the restaurant, but they will not necessarily honor it
Upon arrival I attempted to give a waiter my name (there doesn't seem to be a hostess) and tell him I had a 9pm reservation, but was told to just go get in line and wait for a table
Not a great impression to make on my visiting out of towners
I probably won't go back
When you are looking for traditional italian without frills, this is for you
Very family atmosphere
Food is good without any surprises
Waitstaff was very friendly and let you sit and enjoy to a fault
Good place to try
Il Matone's pizza is the old fashioned style with basil leaves and real mozzerella, which I enjoy very much
If you only like the typical New York style, however, you might not like it
The entrees are really good, a bit overpriced frankly, but not ridiculous
I do think they would do better volume if prices were a bit lower though
Staff is helpful and very friendly
I think they should stay open later though
I order from here every now and then while I'm at work
Great Calimari and excellent entree's
Haven't tried the pasta much, but others have and have enjoyed it
Quick Delivery (I'm across the street though) and consistent, great food
The daily specials are interesting and varied, though I stick with their pasta and appetizers

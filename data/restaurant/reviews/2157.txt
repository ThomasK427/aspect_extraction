The prices were right on for the food, worth every dime
I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic meal, or for any dinner occasion
My girlfriend and I decided to check out this restaurant after catching a movie at Kip's Bay
The place had a nice laid back feel and there was also seating outside
We arrived at around 9:30pm so we didn't have to wait for a table
I had the rigatoni escarole which is a pasta dish with sausage, spinach olive oil and garlic and she had the tortellini ala nonna? which is a tortellini dish with a tomato cream sauce with peas and ham
Both were tasty and very good
The wait staff were courteous though they did forget to bring a cup of tea that my gf ordered
Pricewise, it wasn't too expensive
Bill with tip was only in the $30 range
I would definitely go again
Had dinner there yesterday
Very good Italian Food and not expensive
Nice outdoor dining
This place has turned into one of my favorite places whenever I'm on the east side and go to the movies at Loews Kips Bay
The food is delicious and its not very expensive
and sit outside, sipping on a drink
The front patio is huge, and located far off the street, and with bushes essentially isolating you from the pedestrians and traffic
Aside from that, the service is adequate (visible, and will help you if you ask, but lack initiative), and the food, well, could be a lot worse
The Scene Though this looks like any other sushi counter, with purple vinyl booths and a koi pond in the small dining room, there are glimpses of superiority
The professional waiters recount the owners' finds at the fish market that morning
The small tatami room is booked most nights with sushi-serious private parties
And prices are high--business lunchers expect $50-plus tabs, and a la carters pay $10-15 per piece
The Food The attention to visual details, flavor pairings and freshness are worth the expense
Devotees order seasonal sushi, like fat-streaked Boston blue fin tuna with tartare topping
Platters are budget wise, though no less sublime: each oversized slice comes with a smudge of sauce, from chili-cream for tuna to minty coulis for salmon
The artful rolls, like the two foot long crazy dragon topped with eel, rolled with roe, and layered with tuna and avocado, easily feeds a small family
Cooked dishes, like fried squid and homemade shumai, are run-of-the mill
I am their regular customer since when they in the 34st
Now, they have really great place, two tatami room, nice bar with excellent malaysian bartender, maiter'd who always make you smilling
Nice roll, excellent mojito, fresh fish, even over price
It is surprising that the owner is chinese
Anyway, the service need to be improve
Compare to another restaurant with their level, they have low knowledge server and manager
They even don't understand what I was asking
I hate to review this place only to have people find out about this jewel
However, I will risk it becoming overcrowded to state once and for all that this is my favorite place for sushi in this city after only Sushi of Gari
Sushi is one of my favorite foods which I could eat pretty much every day and never tire of
However, because of extensive experience, I am also extremely picky and know the good from the great from the really great
Bottom line is that the fish at Sen Nin is always fresh and delicious
I usually get a Sushi or Sashimi Deluxe and they do a similar Gari thing, dress the fresh fish in a little dab of jalapeno tofu sauce or garlic sauce or ponzu sauce such that soy is rarely necessary
This place may not be as out-of-this-world creative as Gari, but for more frequent dining ($30+tax at Sen Nin versus $50+tax at Gari), Sen Nin is a great place
Not to say that it is a cheap eat (I don't ever think I've ever had good experience with cheap fish other than fresh caught and grilled when I'm on a tropical island)
Sushi or Sashimi Deluxe sets are rather large portions (not those horrible thick cuts but rather 3-4 pieces of each thing, cut as they should be)
At first glance, the specialty rolls might seem a tad steep at ~$30 each, but each roll is basically chock full of an entire Sushi/Sashimi Deluxe-worth of fish and then rolled in roe! The service is always friendly and the one thing people did not like about the old spot (which was sort of a tacky space) is no longer relevant
This new space is beautiful, with little niches, a yakitori bar in back, a bar in front, and two pretty tatami seating areas for special occasions
I usually opt to drink sake which, despite them having a rather limited selection, has always been solid and enjoyable
If I had the money to spend $30-$35 on dinner every night, I really would order from here every single night
I can not be happier that they are back downtown and I hope you enjoy your visit there, too!
My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night after a particularly long day at the office
It was so refreshing to see such a great selection on the menu and in the sushi/sashimi specials, not to mention a huge list of sake! We both had the Chef's Choice Sashimi, which was OUT of this WORLD
Every piece of fish was so fresh, and cut just right so it melted in your mouth
Everything tasted amazing, and I would definitely rate the quality of fish up there with Tomoe and Blue Ribbon
The decor was nice, probably nothing special but certianly not as crowded as some other sushi places where you're practically sitting on top of the table next to you
This place is a bit pricey ($30 for a roll
) so I wouldn't recomment it if you're starving, or you'll rack up quite the bill
But the taste, quality service, can't be beat
Great find!
we tried the omakase for two and were suprised to see so much fish
there was nothing really unique about the fish that was served to us
i didn't think there was anything that outstanding about the fish or the quality, although the fish was very fresh
the chef did put some spicy sauces on the fish which we liked
the sea urchin mixed with salmon roe was heavenly
overall, pretty good, but nothing that special
While somewhat expensive, this place very well may have the best sushi in New York
While Nobu may have flashy presentation and atmosphere, this place definitely will give the finest sushi restaurants a run for the money
Make sure to order a special roll
While pricey ($25+ for the roll), you get amazing presentation and a unique blend of flavors that you can't get elsewhere
Highly recommended for the sushi conoisseur
One of my favorite places to escape the bustle of Manhattan
Reasonable prices considering the quality of the food
Great food, superb service, a pleasant experience every time
Sushi Sennin offers the freshest and largest pieces of sashmi
It also has the widest selections I've ever seen in New York
Well, it is good for business lunches since it is quite pricey
Try the tatami room in the back if you have a big group of people
Have you been in Japan ?
Have you eaten like in Japan which have very fresh fish and so many kind of fish ?
This place is the best sushi which will serve you many special fresh fish with unbelieveable flavour and decoration
My friend who have never eaten raw fish, he like very much
The fish is very fresh, waiter is so nice, will tell you which is good choice
Hands down the best and freshest fish in NYC
Definitely no atmosphere - you go here for the fish
I have been to Yama, Tomoe, Haru, Sushihana, Sushi by Gari, Sushi Samba, Sushi Yasuda, Iso, Blue Ribbon, etc
- none come close on quality, taste or total bill at end of meal
Expensive - but worth every penny
I eat sushi at least three times a week, and this (along with Tomoe) is one of the best sushi places in town
It's expensive, but the portions are huge and the freshness can't be beat
For Sushi lover, you must come to this restaurant
They sale very fresh Sushi-sashimi which I have never seen
Plus, professional sushi-man who always make nice style and decoration for food
About the waiters, you should enjoy when they make a joke
And don't forget to ask the waiter about the special which they did not write on the menu
Must make reservation
Good food, but expensive
A $75 lunch for 2 people without drinks is a bit much
Our waitress provided good service
However, after 45 minutes, and without allowing us to finish our post-lunch geen tea, the host rudely appraoched us and asked, ANYTHING ELSE? as a none-too-subtle hint to get up and leave
At that price, we did not appreciate being rushed
Me and my husband went here for dinner on an average weekday and were incorrectly over-charged for our dinner

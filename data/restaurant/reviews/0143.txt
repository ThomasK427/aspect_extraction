We loved the crispy basil shrimp rolls and the mahi tuna was nearly perfect
On the other hand, the parmesan french toast was smothered in an unidentifiable brown sause, that completely diluted the sharp flavor of the cheese; and the hangar steak special was more like my grandmother's mush pot roast and the accompanying salad was way too salty
Do try Fire Walk With Me cocktail, it perks you right up, but one is enough, unless you're looking for a hole in your stomach
Lovely space and great service
The staff here were super attentive but not in your face
We went for dinner on a Saturday and were seated in the garden immediately
The food was awesome, we got burgers, onion rings, beers (and they load your plate up with salad if you're trying to not be a lard-ass)
Good vibe, I'd definitely go back there
This place is fabulous
1
Best garden in Williamsburg, hands down
2
Excellent food -- I've only had one or two mediocre things there, and I've tried at least half of the menu
Try the fried oyster appetizer or the feta bread pudding with the obligatory burger
3
Cool but not too cool -- it's only two blocks off Bedford, but the crowd is much more laid back
I haven't seen a single fauxhawk there
4
Open late
Most of the Williamsburg restaurants close around 11
And despite what several other reviewers said, I have always had good luck with the waitstaff
The outdoor waiters especially are exceptionally nice and professional
Sure, the onion rings are, in fact, big and greasy, but what do want from a deep-fried vegetable? Relish, like a lot of restaurants in NYC, is pretty much hit and miss; however, the hits are generally homeruns
The sirloin burger, simply put, is out of this world, if not one of the top five burgers in the city
I have been on a rather extensive search for the Big Apple's finest burger, and, it seems to me, that burger is lurking near the East River in Williamsburg
Really, I don't know how you could try this burger and not feel your toes curl
I wouldn't recommend anything else, though
While not bad, most of the other dishes simply leave me wishing I'd ordered the burger
Both the decor and the food at Relish leave you with a warm glow, or perhaps the warm glow can be attributed to the Sidecar, a delicious cocktail no one outside of Relish seems to have heard of or be able to prepare
I regularly take the trip all the way from the upper, upper west side to eat here
The appetizers are innovative, the entres comforting and the desserts sinful
The service last time was both hip and helpful, encouraging us to be more adventurous in our pork choices, while comforting us, that it would all work out
The outdoor cafe and garden are a pleasure and will only get better as we head into summer
The reviewer who complained about the waitress asking for a tip should just make sure to leave one if he/she knows his mother's Belgian tipping habits
i loved the place, the music and the setting were great, young, hip, cool without being pretentious or too trendy - it just needed more people! we were there prime time (9-10 pm) on a saturday night and it was only half full
cool lighting and decor, great music, nice waitress and hostess, friendly bartender, good food - but where was everybody? maybe the place has peaked but i hope it was just an off night becuase i want to go back
Relish used to be my favorite restuarant in Williamsburg but it seems that everytime I go there something dissappoints me
Sometimes the dish I want is no longer on the menu, sometimes it's the service
Despite that, their burger (I like it medium-rare with cheddar and bacon) is still one of the best in NYC
The bacon slices are huge and crispy and the soft, flavorful meat never falls apart or soaks through the bun
Their Billy-Cheese steak sandwich is very good, too, but last I was there it wasn't on the menu, at least not for dinner anyway
Was excited when this place openned in Willoby BUT that was then
The food is lacking and the service is substandard
Yeah, it's hip BUT don't waste your $$
Plenty of other choices in the neighborhood
I am greatly disappointed in how Relish has fallen in both food creativity and quality and also service
Their menu now has the flair and taste of TGIFriday's and their waitstaff is rude, unattentive and careless with losing orders
When they first opened they were a welcome touch to the neighborhood but now I would not recommend them to anyone unless they just wanted to look at the decor
This isn't your father's comfort food
and of course that's why it's become one of our favorite spots
Great staff! Fantastic food!! Fun atomostphere
It's almost like being in the womb again
Every night is an adventure at Relish
Visually there's always an exciting space to chose to eat in suiting any mood, whether its the renovated dining car, the modern softlit back room, or the relaxing and spacious, wonderful outdoor eating courtyard
The food always offers new possibilities, from a cheap burger that's my favorite in the city to many moderately priced modern American cuisine combinations, many of which are among the most exciting anywhere
The chef's cooking is outstanding, and his experimentation with foods and presentation are really amazing
The food is absolutely top notch and moderately priced! And finally, the service is beyond friendly
The waitstaff are professional and beautiful, representing the best of Williamsburg
Check this place out
You will go back many times without exhausting its possibilities!
While the atmosphere and service was up to billburg standard, the food was burnt and greasy
Probably good for a severe hangover but otherwise verging on inedible, especially for the price
VERY disappointed with this place
This place has a great atmosphere and even the menu looked promising
Almost everything our table ordered was simply lacking
We tried most of the menu items and the only dish that was passable was the skate
The chef wouldn't allow substitutions and the waitress couldn't offer suggestions because she was a vegetarian (when do we get fed up with this)
Gloppy mac and cheese, oversauced ribs and tough ribs, greesey onion rings, on a watery salad, improperly done flank steak, too-dry jerk chicken, etc
Not too mention it wqas way overpriced
The desserts pleased my companions, but I thought they lacked innovation
In a town with so many choices, I would suggest chosing another
Relish is consistantly an excellent place to find a hardy meal with an unexpected twist
The Menu changes seasonally and usually offers some intresting dishes like crawfish cakes
Great upscale diner fare in sleek stylish setting
I was in town visiting friends and they suggested this palce
Upon entrance, the hipness factor seemed a little daunting, but people were generally cool
Had some nice cocktails at the bar before settling in for a great meal
I highly recommend the seared tuna salad -- scrumptious
In Short Young, thickly-accented waiters work a narrow room of fewer than 30 seats
Occasionally, Italian hip-hop that sounds suspiciously similar to Public Enemy circa "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos" plays in the background
Simple Italian fare, with an emphasis on familiar pastas, include "My Father's Style Rigatoni," served with thick slices of sausage and veal meatballs
Other dishes get a matriarchal moniker: "Mom's Meat Loaf with Neapolitan-style Potatoes" and "Homemade Lasagna, Mom's Style
"
My boyfriend took me here on a date when I was visiting him in the city
I was so impressed by the intimate setting, fresh food, cozy atmosphere, and great priced wine!!! We have been twice since, and plan to go back a lot
The music is loud and the tables are small, but it's all in the experience
I enjoyed sitting at the bar and talking to the bartender while waiting for our table
I think the service was great, and I would reccomend this place to anyone looking for a fresh, authentic Italian, well priced meal, in a fun and cozy place
Keep up the good work
I'll be back many times
Those who run this place think that they are doing you a favor
it does not make you feel welcome
there is a superior European attitude here that seems to be held against you if you apparently don't size up
the food is good and the cost reasonable but I don't think I'll be back and they probably don't care
The managers of this restaurant are very arrogant
We called for delivery and were told that we were in the delivery area
Then, we were passed onto another person to take our order
Even though we were in the delivery area, he decided that he didn't want to deliver to 14th and Avenue C, even though this is about 10 blocks away from the restaurant
There are many other restaurant which care about their customers and wlll go an extra mile, let alone 10 blocks, so why bother with this one?
I love the food at Max, but the wait service? Horrible

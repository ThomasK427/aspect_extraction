The food itself was good--not sublime, but a good value and definitely quite enjoyable
My guess is that the negative reviews were submitted by other restaurateurs on 5th who are threatened by Mekong's combo of tasty, affordable food, excellent cocktails and laid-back service
i haven't had a chance to check out their restaurant in the city
fortunately, i was in brooklyn and in the neighborhood
i truly enjoyed the meal
must have the chicken salad plus the calamari
*yummy*  not sure if it's just me, but their appetizers filled me up
it was that huge!   the staff here are so helpful
the ambiance is wonderful
will definitely make a trip to brooklyn again
With trepidation, after reading negative reviews of this place and their limited delivery area, we ordered takeout because we hadn't had Vietnamese in a while and were curious as to whether they'd deliver to us
Oh the horror


food tasted fine but was ridiculously overpriced -- $30 for spring rolls and EXTREMELY skimpy lemongrass chicken and pork
4 tiny springrolls roughly the size of an AA battery
Bizzarro credit-card thin patties of vermicelli as entrees, with very little meat and of an inferior cut (gelatinously fatty pork)
The lettuce, mint, and assorted veggies that were garnish came as-is in grocery store produce bags, still wet with the dew from a produce isle spritzer
I'm by no means gluttonous and usually eat half of entrees, but this was absolutely ridiculous, appetizer-sized and overpriced
Unless you're DYING for Vietnamese and can't take the time to go outside Park Slope, forget it
I must be going to a different MeKong than the one complained about below
My wife and I have been going there since they opened, and have never found the experience to be less than pleasurable
The food nicely fills a gap in the neighborhood, the drinks are fun, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting (nice music selection!)
We've also found the service to be very friendly and accomodating, with no more attitude than anyplace else
We're always welcomed back with familiar greetings
The one gripe I do have, which has been said before, is the delivery range
We fall just outside their delivery range
Sometimes
Sometimes they'll take our delivery order, sometimes we're beyond what they say they'll deliver to
Mildly irritating, but going to the restaurant is well worth the trip
Althought the food was tasty, the attitude was unforgivable
The waiter snapped, rolled his eyes, slammed dishes on the table, and, at the end of the meal, smirked and spun the check in the center of the table
One member of our party remained behiond to tell the waiter that we were disapointed
His answer was You're only customers
She then spoke to the manager who gazed around the room, smirking and said So what do you want me to do?
With all of the excellent restaurants in NYC, we'll certainly never return to MeKong
When I saw that a Vietnamese restaurant was finally going up I couldn't wait for the opening
But, after enduring rude waiters who seemed to be annoyed that they had customers, we had entrees arrive at least ten minutes apart
Repeated reminders eventually brought drinks around
Over all the service was borderline rude
A comment to the waiter yielded, You are only customers, while a mention to the owner produced a dollar sign shaped grin, and What do you want me to do about it? as he surveyed his valuable investment of real estate and over priced fast food
So many Asian food restaurants in the neighborhood are better choices
I had heard great things
and there indeed is wonderful food to be had at Mekong
Service, however, is slow at best, with attitude to boot -- not a welcome trend in this laid back neighborhood
I thought the answer might be takeout
same great food without the wait or the attitude
Unfortunately, this is one of the only Slope restaurants I know that severely limits its delivery range
and thereby its once eager clientele
In Short Behind a stately glass-and-black-wood facade marked with a slightly sinister emblem, St
Helens Cafe serves Vivace espresso, beer and wine to a parade of hip young people
The small room has a calm, pub-like feel, and locals linger over beverages and the house stash of newspapers from around the world
The counter is in a separate room and offers baked goods, sweets and a variety of other snacks
This place is the best brunch spot in town
Here, everything is made to order
including their coffee! Their service is superb (we always get the same friendly waitress), considering the standard of W'burg joints
and their food is simple, yet perfect
BTW, must try their baked eggs!
I had heard about the baked eggs, but when I had them on Sunday, I realized why they're so famous
They're St
Helen's signature item and they're awesome
Everything is made to order, so don't go if you're starvingandhavetoeatrightnow! but go for delish food, cool music, and the best darn coffee this side of the bridge
This place is definitely hipper than thou, but the service was friendly anyway
Great food and drinks
Very nice wait staff, who are friendly and attentive
Reasonable portions, not for the SuperSize set
Over all high quality, organic food
the best coffee in NYC
The garden in the back is beautiful
Good place for coffee and light snack
Nice ambience and lovely garden
Lets itself down by poor service and food that veers more towards arty than tasty
The brunch options are too lightweight to satiate
The baked eggs took almost an hour to arrive - on not an especially busy Sunday afternoon - and when they did they were suprisingly not quite baked
This place is run by the nicest duo you'll ever meet
The cafe is warm and friendly and has a great decor
The baked eggs and breads and pastries are to die for
The main attraction, though, is REAL Seattle-style coffee and fresh, homemade ginger and mint teas! I dream of it when I am not there
there is not attitude here, like at many of the other W-burg restaurants
Don't let the so-so decor fool you - their food is delicious! I've tried many of NYC's Indian eateries, and these guys compare very favorably
What they lack in decor they more than make up for in their homemade-feeling dishes
In Short An upscale version of the nearby Candle Cafe, this duplex attracts hard-core vegetarians and meat-eaters on their night off
Purple and gold lend a royal air to the leather booths, framed mirrors, and walled sconces, and huge windows upstairs offer a view of the namesake 79th Street
Though weekend nights and Sunday brunch draw the largest crowds, neighborhood residents master this vegan menu of quinoa-lentil cakes, seitan piccata, and sweet-potato pumpkin pie by popping in daily
I'm usually not a big fan of vegeterian cuisine but great food coupled with the ambiance has got me to be a repeat customer
Great place for an intimate dinner
There are an growing number of vegetarian restaurants in the city - most are simple, comfortable places that offer good everyday menu options
Candle 79 boldly breaks this mold
The food, ambiance, and service is second to none (for a vegetarian restaurant)
Finally we vegetarians can have have our nice place too
Whether it's a special occaision, a romantic date night, or an evening where you just want to try a new caliber of vegetarian food, Candle 79 is the place to go
My favorite dishes are the chimichurri and the seitan picatta - but really you can't go wrong with any selection
If reading the menu on-line doesn't make your mouth water, I don't know what will
then I wouldn't have to come here to get a fabulous meal and feel as good after the meal as I do during
Vegetarian/vegan cuisine is only as good as the staff's love and commitment to it and I have been to no other such restaurant in New York where this is greater
5 thumbs up from our family!
some of the most delicious food i've ever had in a place that feels great
if you're not granola crunchy, don't worry, they serve wine and excellent meals that just happen to be healthy
you always feel great after a dinner or lunch at candle 79
great mother/baby lunches every few weeks too

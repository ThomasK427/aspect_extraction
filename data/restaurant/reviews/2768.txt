There can be a huge pileup by the lobster tank of people waiting to enter at peak dimsum time, but the besuited staff keeps the line moving, and it's worth the wait
Entrees are equally good and inexpensive
Ingredients are much fresher than average, great cheese, great-tasting pizza
Also, the service is super-friendly
Right there in Brooklyn's Chinatown strip, pizza
Why? I don't know
How? I don't know
But whatever the history, it's quite a decent pie, plus all the traditional extras
Delivery's fast (and accurate!) and prices are good
What more do you want?
By far the best pizza in NY! My entire family continues to enjoy Scotti's food after more than 25 years
Italians know their pizza!
This is the best Pizza in NYC without a doubt
The flavor and ingredients have remained true from their inception
I've lived in Italy and this is as close as it gets
The absolute best pizza in the world
I was coming to Johnny's back when I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn
They make the best Sicilian (squares, to all my fellow Brooklynites) in ANY town
I always make a point to stop there and grab a slice when I'm visiting relatives
I live in greenpoint
Love Thai food
This is the best takeout here!
It looks like a small pizza joint, and it is, but the food and service are out of this world
They have a good size dining area in the back and we are always seated promptly and treated like family
As for the pizza, I'd highly recommend having it fresh out of the oven
I've tried a different item on the menu each time I've gone, and everything is always delicious
Looks like an ordinary pizza joint from the outside, but the back room has excellent, cheap Italian food, and the owners and workers couldn't be nicer
The pasta i fagioli soup is the best I've had in NYC, including at very expensive places
Not a fancy place, just a really good one
I have eaten here consistently for almost 3 years, that's why it's kind of sad to report that the overall quality of the food at Thai Cafe has taken a noticable dive
Green Curry is being ruined by an over abundance of bay leaves, the meat often overcooked
Pad Thai has been runny and way too 'tangy'
Granted, they are usually incredibly busy, but that's no excuse to serve mediocre food - take out especially
I've eaten here every week since I moved to Bklyn 8 years ago and it's been delicious every time
The chefs and staff are welcoming and happy to make substitutions or tune the spice up or down to your requests
The renovations made a big difference, but there is always a wait, especially 8 PM on wknds
Recommendations: panang curries
The only drag is they never delivered, but I just heard that they're doing daytime delivery service
When the food is this good, people DO come to you
PS the petite waitress has the most brilliant smile I've ever seen, and she's always so happy to see you, even if it's your first time
Why aren't more restaurant staff that pleased to have guests?
Thai Cafe is the best Thai food I have ever had, hands down
I cannot order pad thai at other restaurants anymore because nothing comes close to their clean, fresh, well balanced version
I lived in Greenpoint and used to eat there several times a week, its that good, and its also that cheap! The thai iced tea is good too, as well as the grilled pork loin salad with lime and peanuts and don't forget the mussels, and
The most spicy, delicious, and gotta have some more shrimp pad thai
The food is definitely the attraction, but the service has been consistently bad on every visit
I have gotten warmer and much friendlier welcome and outstanding service at the other Thai restaurants in the Greenpoint area
Great, authentic fish dishes, delicious vegetarian choices and terrific artwork hanging on the walls
Inexpensive $5
95 Pad Thai! Can't say enough good things about this restaurant, you are missing out, if you haven't been there
I recommend the Salmon Penang w/ skewered Shrimp Veggies or the Filet of Red Snapper w/ Shitake Mushrooms Ginger
Thai cafe's green curry is tops
The service is good, the ambience superior to other thai restaurants in the hood
The food quality is much better than Plan Eat
Their consistency if superior to both Plan Eat and Amarin (another local Thai spot)
They will gladly comply with your spicy-ness request
LAst checked--no brown rice available
Thai Cafe is probably the best in NY
The dishes are simple yet elegant
The Specials board offers quite a range of variations on a theme
If spicy is what you want they are not afraid to bring the pain yet leaving the delicate flavors of more mild thai spices
Basic fare here nothing too fancy
It seems like they have an endless menu of egg and cheese sandwich varieties
Most of the stuff is breakfast food and it's basic diner type stuff
If you need a quick, filling, carb filled meal that's way cheap then you found it and they serve it up with a smile
They close at 4pm daily and are closed Sundays so this is much more of a breakfast and lunch spot and seems to focus on local factory workers and truckers
However, as the neighborhood has changed so too has the customer base
It's beginning to feel a lot like Williamsburg-errr
this was our second time going here and i think the food just keeps getting better
we've been to several other polish restaurants in this area and nothing has come close to the food here
the soups were superb and only $2 a bowl, and the entire dinner, with beers, cost less than $30 for two people
the service was great and attentive, without rushing us
i think the waitstaff recognize returning customers and really treat them well with smiles
i can't say enough good things about this place
it was great to see a mix of poles and hipsters and i really can't wait to go back and try more dishes
It's hard to find a decent Chinese restaurant at any price but this is one of them
(I rate this higher then 95% of restaurants I ever attended
This place happens to be beatifully designed, the atmosphere is relaxed (as opposed to the noisy community dining atmosphere in so many busy chinese reataurants - which can also be OK) the food is authentic Chinese as opposed to what they think Americans would like, the staff is friendly and unhurried
What else can one ask for?
Perhaps the best polish food value in the city
The red Borsht provides a hearty meal for $1
The crossed-out in the name signifyies the lack of Bedford trendies
Only G-trainers here
There is no one word that can adequately describe the choice polish cuisine, the immaculate facilities and the truly glorious service at this quaint Greenpoint deli, so I will have to make one up: SCRUMTRULESCENT! Marias Deli is simply scrumtrulescent! Tip: Ask for Jan, who is probably hiding in the back kitchen
Hes known to share a vodka shot with willing patrons on the weekends
You haven't experienced Greenpoint until you've experienced the sandwiches at Maria's Deli
My personal favorite The Oracle
Marias Deli is a family-owned and operated sole proprietorship
Maria's had her doors open for over a quarter of a century and she continues to provide only the best homemade polish and american delicacies for the denizen of Greenpoint as well as foreigners visiting the neighborhood she doesnt discriminate
Her daily fresh selections of soups, chicken cutlet, pork chops, baked chicken legs, stuffed cabbage, cheese blintzes, polish kielbasa, bigos (sauerkrout with ham and kielbasa), fasolka (lima bean specialty soup), flaczki (beef tripe), various salads (don't shy away from the vegetable salad), and gargatuan sandwiches make everyone feel as if they were transported to a remote area of Poland for a traditional, delectable lunch
Grab a Polish beer to go with your meal and say Dzienkuje to Maria who always serves her customers with a smile
Great tasting food, packed with plenty of flavor
Simple dishes that will satisfy any food critic, and leave your pocket with spare change! Amarin Cafe is my Brooklyn stop No
1 choice, I'm sure it will become yours as well ;)
This place was a nice surprise when I moved to Williamsburg
I ordered the first time with my sister - I had the garlic and pepper chicken and she had the spicy broad noodles with shrimp
It's very reasonably priced, and I've yet to have an overly greasy meal there, which is sometimes a problem with Thai food
Great flavors, fresh ingredients and quick delivery keep me addicted
This is the only Thai food place I know of that knows what spicy means
The noodle dishes are the best, but I've also enjoyed the rice dishes as well

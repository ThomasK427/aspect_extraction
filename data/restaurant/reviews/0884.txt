We had dinner in their Garden and won't be going back
The food was mediocre and too expensive for what they served
Don't get the lemonade--it has no lemon flavor! The fried chicken was re-fried
not fresh!
This place has the good traditional food you'd find at an authentic spanish food
meaning if you want some delicious chicharon (fried pork), as delicious as you remember eating as a child, come here! The ambiance is nothing spectacular, but it's good food at a decent price
In Short These bright white storefronts are accented with green and red details and photos of the chain's boyish founder
The simple menu focuses on standard pies and chicken-centric specialty pizzas--the Hawaiian BBQ, BBQ chicken, and bacon and chicken club--each topped with fresh ingredients like baby portobello mushrooms and roma tomatoes
A selection of sides includes bread sticks, cheese sticks, chicken strips and a handful of dipping sauces
If the best NYC can offer is Papa John's, lets get McDonalds to make pizza too !
Greatly enjoyed the dinner
I went with a group of eight on a thursday night with reservations
The place has seating for maybe 50 patrons so reservations are recommended
A relatively small and simple menu, but the food was great
Not amazing, but definately great
Their wine selection is small, but reflecting the northern italian flavor with chianti and sangiovese varieties
The atmosphere was cozy and a little noisey as the night went on, but that should be expected for such a small restuarant
The price was just right too
I paid $20 for the most expensive secondi that would have cost me easliy $30 in a midtown italian cocina
The service was excellent as well
A place worth experiencing once or twice but not more than that
I'm a big fan of Northern Italian cooking, and this place is the business
Before coming here, I'd splurged on a meal at Lupa (which I enjoyed very much) but Paprika's gnocchi were every bit as light and fluffy, their specials every bit as daring, for half the price and twice the portion size
The staff were charming - I'll be back soon
The best brunch around the East Village
I tried the scrambled eggs with pesto over polenta: incredible!!  That how a brunch should be!! Can't wait for next Sunday
Thank you!
Paprika is a unique blend of excellent food, cool and comfortable atmosphere, and friendly and efficient service
This restaurant never fails to amaze me whether it be for lunch, dinner or brunch
It's great for a romantic dinner for 2, or for a group
Alway good, fresh food is served
food is great, owners are great
funky, laid-back atmosphere
posh, but relaxed feel, i love it
Nice time, great atmosphere, amazing food
A place to go with friends or with a nice date to have a great bottle of wine(great prices) and dessert is a most
Don't be confused by the name
It's absolutely a real italian
Try the Pizzoccheri or the Pappardelle with Oxtail ragu and you can't go wrong
And no attitude whathsoever
A nice americano coffee, a Bellini and a great main dish for $10
80! That's what a Brunch should be
I highly recomend
I loved it!! we went Saturday night, and the atmosphere was great, the music; we waited 15 minutes, but we had a nice bottle of Chianti, and time flew by
The staff were very friendly and kind
We decided to share and ask for all kind of things (antipasto, pasta, steak, salad) the food arrived fast and it was excellent
The tiramisu
I will come back for that
Not expensive
ooh, i only tried the pastas and they were really satisfying
they cook the pasta al dente and the sauces really are hearty
perfectly coat the pasta! i tried this place because of the diner's deck
a group of us couldn't decide where to go so we picked a card from the restaurant guide deck and we were brought to paprika! the ambience was romantic yet fun
i had the veal ravioli, i tried the oxtail pasta, and sausage pasta
they were all great! try this place if you want simple yet delicious italian food
Some Italian places are too heavy or creamy, but I couldn't stop eating them!
I love gnocchi, and in this place are amazing, try with tomato e mozzarella, and i recommend the daily specials
Good quality and very low prices
Perfect to have dinner with friends! It's cheap enough that just everyone can afford it, and the food is fantastic
A lively Italian crowd is always hanging out there, lots of EV people and good music
We all loved it!
Following the great reviews I recently had dinner at Paprika
Yes, the food is very good, but, as to my opinion, definitely not among the top places
Service was very good
The decor was very bland
Overall, I think it is a little overrated
Nice place and good service but the food is absolutely outstanding
I consider it one of the best deal in the East Village
We wanted to go to Cafe Mogador one lazy afternoon but it was packed so we went to Paprika
An hour and a half later I was thanking all the Gods and Angels in heaven
The food was superb (and at amzing prices) and the waitress polite and helpful
Decor is nice too
I'm not sure how it is when crowded but the food and the value alone is worth many visits
Paprika has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in the St
Marks area
Actually, few restaurants come closer to delivering the kind of great food that comes promptly to your table at the prices they charge
I would recommend making reservations as people have caught on to the great dining experience
And when you do make that call, ask for the corner table -- it has the most space in what is sometimes too-close seating
This restaurant has got to be one of the best bargains in town
It's early bird special from 4pm to 7pm is a steal: for $9 you get an appetizer and entree
After that the prices are very affordable and the food is plentiful, delicious and very vegetarian-friendly
Your best veg bet is the penne with mozzarella and tomatos and the field greens salad with parmesan
The place is cozy without being crammed, and the waitstaff is friendly and attentive, but overall the service is a bit on the slow side, espeically on busy weekend nights
A great place for a date too
My husband and I have eaten here often
It is not the best food in NYC
It's not the most romantic or the best ambience
But we have always liked it because the food is pretty good and it's an amazing value
the best bests are the lobster, stuffed sole, baked mushrooms,and crab legs
How can you go wrong with a lobster, salad, and side for around $16?? If you're in the neighborhood and have a hankering for seafood but don't want to spend outrageous amounts of money, Coldwaters is a good bet
The food was awful and not as described
I cut one of the Lobster and Corn Dumplings in half and found a mound of corn and one miniscule speck of lobster
I asked the waitress if the crabmeat stuffing that came with the lobster was real crab, and though she told me it was, it turned out to be imitation crab
The service wasn't great either
Our waitress was courteous enough but had to come back to us 3 times to ask us what our drink orders were
Don't bother going here
We went with another couple and we all kinda got the same thing
We were not impressed with the food at all, but at least we didn't waste a lot of money! We got stuffed fish, and it had little taste
My stuffed shrimp were tiny
The salad dressing is watered down

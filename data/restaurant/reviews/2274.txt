Americans/other be warned, the food might be a little too authentic for your tastes
I travel a great deal each month, as I am between NY, LA, London/Paris/Milan and even India
As a businessman, I am always eating out with friends and associates and my palate is continually becoming more refined
Bay Leaf is absolutely phenomenal! By far, it is one of my favorite restaurants in the world!! From the classy decor to the warm staff to just some of the most flavorful foods I have been exposed to!!!  I am always raving about this place to friends at colleagues that one day someone told me to post to CitySearch
Soooo, let it be known that I absolutely adore this place!
I went to this restaurant with my family
I read a old Zagat recommendation
The food was average but very pricey
Ex
My son ordered a plate of grilled shrimps
They cost $25
00 just for five! He didn't even want to eat it because it was so spicy and salty
I would have had better tasting food at a takeout restaurant
The bathrooms were dirty and small
They seemed like they hadn't been cleaned in a long time
I recommend people to stay far, far away
Bay Leaf Indian Brasserie is one of my favorite restaurants in New York
Being in the entertainment business, I am bicoastal, thus I frequent restaurants in NY and LA
I look for three things anywhere I go: ambiance, quality of food and service
Bay Leaf hits a 10 in all three and thus, I adore it!  I highly recommend it and only wish one thing: Bay Leaf Indian Brasserie: LA
Voila and God Bless!
Had a mediocre but pricey meal
Empty restaurant
Seemed like I had come to a place way past its glory
The food was excellent! A mix of American, Asian, and Cajun, from appetizers to main course everything was well worth the prices which were great also
The restaurant was comfy but I didn't realize how small it was
In the warm weather I guess you could eat outside but in the winter, a large crowd would definately fill up the place quickly
Definately a must try
This resturant is now called the Shanghi Village
It hasn't changed it number and when you call, they will tell you that they are the cottage and that they offer free wine
However, they do not!!! The place was small and the food was good, but you have to pay for wine and it's not good wine either!!
Located in the theatre district, this inexpensive Chinese restaurant is a favorite
The service is fast, the food good and the portions large
They give you free wine with dinner and plum wine with desert
Two people can share an appetizer, order two entrees and end up spending less than $30
In Short Subterranean, small and wood-paneled, the restaurant serves an assortment of Thai standards to a midtown business and pre-theater constituency
Specialties of the house include sliced steak with peanut sauce, crispy duck in tamarind-pineapple sauce, a garlic-marinated half chicken and curried chicken-filled puff pastries
The array of Thai soups, including a pork wonton soup, is also popular
The lunch menu offers reduced portions at reduced prices, accompanied by steamed rice
I could have thai food every day of the week still love it
This place does not dissapoint
Although it is a small place the food was just great and prices as well
Went there for lunch and was treated nicely
Overall a pleasant lunch
I eat here all the time
Best thai food anywhere
The food is ALWAYS good, no matter what you order
There are lots of vegetarian choices on the menu
The service is fast
The thai ice tea is the best I've ever tasted
And it is so cheap for what you get
The atmosphere is very cosy
It is usually full
You dont have to make reservations but you may have to wait 5-10 mins for a table
But that is because it is sooo good!
I can't understand all the positive reviews
Went there last month with a friend and was very disappointed
The food was way below average, the service was lacking, the decor is tacky
Stay away
I first visited Topaz after a two week trip to Thailand in '03
The food was perfect and the service fast, friendly and flexible
I have been back on five subsequent visits to NY and have taken several friends and business partners
Try the Drunken Noodles (AKA Pad Khi Mao) and Red Snapper with Chili and Garlic
I love to try all the new, trendy and expensive places in NY but always make a point to have one meal at Topaz Thai
This Place was nothing special
Went there for a post birthday date and was seated right next to the bar(if you have eaten there you know what that means)
The pad thai was blah, drinks were blah
Nothing special
This is a non descript little place that is a true jewel well worth finding
The aromas alone could satisfy
The tom ka was heady with generous use of coconut
The kang ped was some of the best I've ever had
The portions are generous and the service amiable and prompt
The decor isn't much in a long thin paneled room with cramped tables, but is somehow very inviting and comfortable
This is one of the best values I've found in NYC
I used to eat here at least once a week about 10 years ago
Now it has become a favorite and is packed all the time
I have to say that with popularity, the food has fallen in quality
It used to be sooo good now it is just okay
Situated next to the Mysterioso Bookstore, this tiny Thai haven can fill up in less than 30 minutes on a weekday night
Try and snag the two-top in the alcove at the front for some slightly divey romance
Food is very good (the Topaz fried rice especially) and the service is excellent
Prices are not much different from the Midwest -- about $10 for an entre, which is a steal by NYC standards
Definitely worth a trip!
DO NOT MAKE ANY PLANS AFTER DINNER- You have no idea what time you will be seated, when you will leave, the food is good, you wont be able to move afterwards! it is packed, small, busy, congested, if you can get over all that, the food is worth it
Delicious Penang curry, Pad Thai, satay and I cant remember everything ordered, but finished it all, and kept nibbling until we were going to explode
We waited 2 hours for a table
They ask you to come by and check in every now and then, there is no place to wait inside!! If you get over all that, then go
Grab a drink at Le Parker Meridian next door while you are waiting! The tables are small and cramped, and the chairs are for petite Asian girls-be weary
There's isnt too much an ambiance, just eat and leave
Topaz was the first place that I tried Thai Food
I've been to New York twice and each time I'm there I make sure that I go to Topaz! I just luv the food, its the best Thai Food I've ever taste and when I visit this year, I'll be there again and again and again!!!
I went here on a recommendation of some colleagues, and was quite pleased with every aspect of my experience
The food was fresh and hot, with the perfect level of spices, the service was fast, and it was well priced for dinner
It's a little crowded in there so it's probably best to get there early or make reservations, but overall, I would highly recommend this place
A friend of mine recommended this place
This place is a hole, food is greasy and the staff are ignorant
There should be better places in the area, and the lines are super long
I have never seen a host as self-righteous or stubborn as I did Friday night at Topaz
He tried to sit four of us around a 2-person round table (25 minutes after we showed up with a reservation)

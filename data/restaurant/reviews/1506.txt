when the waitress finally took our order after being seated at the table for over 30 minutes only to wait another 45 minutes for food and when the food arrived the order was incomplete
To top that the lone waitress quit during her shift and left the restaurant high and dry! Although the cupcakes are big as Buick that won't save Burgers Cupcakes; if they don't get their act together in a New York minute they are gonna be a done deal
So on my week long vacation in New York, I was on the look out for cupcakes
Magnolia's was dissapointing and My Favorite Dessert Co
was alright
My friend and I made the wrong turn looking for the large camera store in the same area and I saw the sign for Burgers and Cupcakes
The restaurant name piqued my interest but the large sign Say you hate B*sh and get a free cupcake was the clencher
Free cupcakes and anti-B*sh equals a 10 in my book
I went with two friends on a Thursday evening, not crowded, plenty of tables
I got a beef patty with cheddar cheese and grilled onions
We shared an order of fries
Then we each got cupcakes
I rarely eat red meat but was in the mood that night and the burger didn't disappoint
I loved the burger, found the size perfect with the amount of shared fries i had
cooked the way i wanted and juicy
The grilled onions were done not too cooked down but also not undercooked
The fries were skin on, coarse salted and quite delicious
So far so good
Then the cupcakes
i had the chocolate chocolate and found it to be dry and the frosting wasn't good, it was too bitter
My friend has the chocolate vanilla and while she said the cake was dry her frosting was delicious
overall, i recommend and am interested in trying more of the burger and fry combos as compared to the cupcakes
So-so service, above average taste but below average size on the burgers, very nice staff
but I'll keep going back for the cupcakes
My chocolate-with-vanilla-frosting selection was absolutely unbelievable
the best cupcake I've ever had
Raving about them back at the office, a co-worker who had visited on a separate occasion agreed
much better than highly touted Magnolia, he said (I haven't been to Magnolia, so I can't compare)
BC's cupcakes are quite a find
Running the risk of having to buy new pants, I'll keep going back
my bf i came here yesterday for dinner around 7:30pm it wasnt crowded at all for sunday night so we got our pick of tables
the solitary waitress was friendly though i found her service a little slow
you assemble your own burger by choosing a base meat (beef, chicken, vegetarian, salmon, turkey, $5
95 each) and then add toppings for $1 each
i choose a beef burger with grilled mushrooms and pizza (tomato sauce mozzarella) toppings, cooked medium
my bf ordered his burger with turkey bacon pepper jack cheese
the burgers are small, plump, and more meatball than patty
the meat is very juicy, so you risk a soggy bun if you order the patty too undercooked or eat it too slowly
though the quality of the meat was good, i found the patty slightly too bland for my taste since i prefer my burgers with more seasoning
overall, i liked the burgers at bc less than shake shacks, but i also prefer to avoid the nuisance of hour-long waits common at the latter joint
we also ordered regular fries ($2) and chili cheese fries ($4) with our meal
the fries, thin-cut, salted, and skin-on, were crispy, browned, and hot
they were also very plentiful one order should be enough for two people
the chili cheese fries were also really good and came topped with mild chili and cheese
they were a little messy, and we ended up devouring the basket with our forks
unfortunately, they had sold out of cupcakes since the afternoon, so i didnt get a chance to try the second item in their namesake
we were stuffed though, and the cupcakes gives us a good excuse to go there again
Stumbled upon this place accidentally and was pleasantly surprised - wonderful, juicy, burgers (small in size but great flavor), good brunch (limited menu, but good omelets), and delicious cupcakes! I'm not a big cupcake fan, but the icing made the whole thing
It's definitely worth a try - and it's cheap!
I thought this place was adorable
A different kind of place to dine
The cupcakes taste as good as they look!! Not too expensive either
And if your not a big meat eater they have turkey and veggie burgers
I would really recommend treating yourself one day, you'll enjoy the experience!!
I stopped in here the other day and what a great surprise
Very simple menu made it easy to choose and the burger I got was great
If you have a sweet tooth this is also the place for you
They have a huge assortment of cupcakes and other desserts that won't have you leaving hungry
I found 3 great restaurants on diningfever, and saved a few bucks! I recomend them to anyone looking for a good deal
I got the best deals from Dining Fever! Never thought it could be soo easy and I enjoyed all the savings!
This place was great
If you're a food lover and are looking for authentic Japanese and extremely fresh food then I highly recommend this place
I had a shrimp appetizer that was in a delicious sauce
They're know for having the best noodle dishes in the city and I have to admit the noodles were amazing
Again very, very fresh
It's tucked away on Barrow street- very quiet
I went with a friend and we both ordered different apps and entrees
Both were excellent
The staff was very friendly
Again, I highly recommend and will be going back soon! Happy eating
I loved the ambiance
The food phenominal
The service i have a big ? I don't know if it's because there is a shortage of experience
Well i asked the server to describe a certain wine for me,he seemed like he knew what he was talking about,till i tasted it,it was totally the opposite of what he described
The desert made up for it
The host belongs at a diner,no eye contact at all,and we felt not that welcome
I hope the next time we come we'll have a far more better experience
From the moment you walk into InTent you are transported to a different place and culture
The food is fantastic, the deserts are to die for, but I was most impressed at how nice the staff was
The hostess seated us even though our entire party wasn't there and then someone wearing a Payard shirt came over and told us about all of the entrees/deserts and gave us his personal recommendations
At our request, he also showed the last one of our party the tented part of the restaurant (we were sitting in the front)
He was so friendly the entire night that we didn't realize till halfway through the meal that he was the Payard, i
e
, the owner and renowned chef
We will go back to InTent many times, and we are recommending it to all of our friends
I highly recommend it
It is also a great place for a date as the tented part of the restaurant is really stunning
I and 3 friends went there last night for dinner and loved the food, which I have to say was uniformly outstanding and some of the best I've had for under a zillion dollars in a long time
For entrees, my favorites were the coriander and honey pork ribs or the seared scallops, both of which were to die for
For appetizers, I'd recommend the crab napolean or the monkfish mousse
The latter sounds a little unexpected but is really delicious and was the consensus favorite at our table
(On the whole, the menu is more creative/much less cookie-cutter than a lot of places
) The wines we had were also very good and both the wine and food prices are quite reasonable
Once seated, service in our case was excellent -- our waitress was polite and clearly knew what she was doing, and the chef and maitre'd both checked in on us over the course of the evening
There was a little confusion with the hostess (I'm still not sure who she was), when we walked in, though, and I did notice that some of the other service folks running around seemed to be a bit more on the newbie side/still learning some of the ropes
But it's a brand-new place and so my guess is those minor kinks will disappear soon


Intent's food is a special experience
From appetizers to dessert, each dish is carefully considered but not overdone

We couldn't really enjoy ourselves since alot of the games were taken
The drinks were a little overpriced, I paid $11
50 for one drink and $7
50 for another (the prices aren't listed)
The serives is great, the staff comes to you; wherever you go, they go and bring you your order
The staff are young and friendly, the games are great, and I enjoy myself everytime I go
I went to Dave and Busters with a friend a I feel that the cover charge is completely unecessary
I went back during the day on Saturday and we had a great time
The service was very good, the food, unremarkable but fine as pub grub goes
The specialty drinks are handled with care but if you want a regular mixed drink stick with rum and coke or some derivative (7 and 7), etc
The game room was the highlight of our visit
The games are fun and the staff really helpful when it comes to figuring it all out
We really had a blast and I would recommend it if playing games will be the most important part of your visit
ENJOY!
This neighborhood is getting so hip! And Tokyo Pop, with the same owners as Cafe du Soleil across the street, is one of the finest sushi places I've been to (and I've been to many!) Large 8-piece rolls run $3-6! Unbelievable prices for fresh delicious fish
There is an extensive menu including other Japanese entrees I have not yet tried, but they sound amazing and are also quite affordable
Basically, it's got the prices of Monster Sushi and the quality of Sushi Samba
The staff is also willing to make substitutions and additions to orders
Plus Tokyo Pop has friendly hot waitstaff, a classy fun ambiance and outdoor seating available
The bar is also a laidback place to throw back a few beers
Highly recommended!
Such a great find! This place has dishes so elegantly created --- all the flavors in harmony
Poached eggs with serrano ham was ohhhh soooo good
And nothing like a foie gras mayo to turn a mayo-hater into an all-time fan
Then comes dessert
Tarte tatin for the classics and GRILLED STRAWBERRIES, my new fav
Wine list full of great spanish wine to boot!
Degustation is a HAVEN of culinary perfection!!! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this restaurant!!! I went with a very good friend tonight, and we started out with the grilled shrimp and croquetas, both of which were fantastic! The shrimp was perfectly tender and salted, and the croquetas were bursting with flavor and just delicious
We next had the scallops, which were absolutely superb with a tomato-garlic sauce and tasty mushrooms (which I normally don't like!)
The short-rib stuffed squid was stellar as well, though I was slightly less crazy about the roast beef sandwich, which, though still excellent, was my least favorite of the dishes
The lamb was absolutely the perfect cap to the meal
easily the most tender, bursting-with-flavor, perfectly textured lamb I have ever tasted
Service was so attentive as well
My water glass was always refilled and they brought a new set of appropriate silverware for each course
The restaurant is beautiful as well, and very intimate with seating for only 16 around the kitchen area which is like a fusion between sitting at a sushi bar and watching Iron Chef at the same time
But the lighting is low, decor much resembling a romantic, very elegant sushi bar, and overall just beautiful
This was easily one of the best dinners I have ever had in my life
PERFECT especially for anniversaries/birthdays, and a GREAT deal for the money
about $40-$50 per person for 4 or 5 courses without wine, and the tasting menu is a great deal as well
Loved the place just walking in there
it's made in the communal spirit of Spanish tavernas, everyone sits at a thin table in front of the bar-like kitchen
Very intimate, low lighting and interesting but not over-the-top design
The wine list is rather meager but has several excellent choices
Only disappointment was the port, advertised as vintage at $12 it was actually a cheap Ruby
But that was quickly forgotten once the food started coming
Got the chef's 5 daily special (5 tapas and a desert tapa for $50) and then ordered half the other tapas on the menu
Scrumptiousness galore
Scallops, rabbit and quail were the best
Over all, an uber-delicious experience
Calling the reservation line, I botched my first attempt at the name
my mouth strangely contorting the name into some strange French word
luckily they were full for the night I was attempting to reserve so I quickly finished the call without giving my name
On my second try, I not only got the name right but I secured a reservation as well and it was smooth sailing from there
The room, while small, is very nice and quiet and rather comforting if you can say that about wall-to-wall slate
one of the few NYC restaurants where you don't have to practically scream to be heard by your friend
The kitchen is open and surrounded by bar seating (the only kind of seating), and they have a nice set-up where the waitress stays behind the bar and the chefs deliver your food after you have watched them prepare it
And the food: really, really good food
pork belly, stuffed octopus, rabbit (a special that night) were all stand-outs on our visit
Small plates are taking over the city but this is another example of a fun spot with great food and a great experience and I would highly recommend giving it a try
Went for brunch on a Sunday with friends
The hostess was friendly, ambience is cute and trendy
They have a huge variety of french breakfast crepes, which tasted pretty good too
The menu is pretty elaborate for brunch
Good service
Well-made bloody mary
Definitely will go there again
Went after a friend recommended it for brunch
Menus avg and service is exceptionally bad
Took 20 mins to order drinks (we're talking water and juice)
Another 20 before the sole waiter takes our brunch order
Waiter forgets our drink order
There is a hostess who likes to smile blankly on all customers but is otherwise useless- perhaps she could help the lone waiter
After a friendly reminder, waiter brings over the wrong drinks to us (orange instead of cranberry)
We wait another 45 mins for food-we're talking eggs and crepes!! until waiter realized he has either (i)not put in the order to the kitchedn (2)has better things to do than wait (3) envious of the useless hostess
Whichever it is, he laughs embarrassingly promising food in the near future
Apparently, that did not mean in the next 20 mins, and my guest and I went across the street to a similar, more efficient place
There are about a 100 variations of 'blue point' type diners in the area and I would go to every one of them before ever going back to blue pointless
I took two friends from out of town to brunch
The brunch menu is a bit like a French cafe menu
croque monsiuers, omelettes and the like
The service was friendly and reasonably quick, but my croque madame was not as hot as it should have been
the bread actually seemed chilled in spots
It was, however tasty
One of my companions was given a paltry handful of fries as a side with his omelette
they could use some pointers on presentation and plating, it seems to me
Overall, a mixed bag
I'd go back, but only if I were meeting a friend from the neighborhood
I went for a dinner date a few nights ago and was not impressed
The service was great but that could have been because we were two out of four customers in the whole place
They seemed eager to please but the steak frites we ordered were tough and stringy
Perhaps it was a mistake not to order one of the 125 crepes listed on the menu but a French place should be able to get steak frites right
The ceiling-to-floor blue and green tiled decor reminded me more of a bathroom than of a restaurant -- not the romantic bistrot I was hoping for
Great place, great food, excellent service!!! I went there first time for brunch on saturday and was excellent
Went back on a friday night with some friends for drinks and had a great time
very good wine selection
It's not a pastie, its not a patty or an empanada, but it's twice as nice
DUB pies are fun filling fast comfort food from Down Under and they are Delicious
I've not been to Gareth's new shop so I can't speak about the decor but I can attest to the quality of DUB pies as I had them on a few occasions back when he was catering before he had the store
You couldn't have a nicer, treat made by a nicer guy
Glad to know he's gone brick and mortar

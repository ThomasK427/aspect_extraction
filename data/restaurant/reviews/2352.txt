Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
They have the best bagels in all of NY! They have the highest selection of cream cheeses you could possible imagine
I recommend getting an everything bagel with one of their specialty type cream cheeses, which you won't find in other delis or bagel shops
The service was wonderful and we felt like we were part of a family
This is a great bagel/deli
Much better than nearby Tal Bagels
There are a lot of different schmers and they were generous
Bagels are very fresh and full of flavor
these are the best bagels in new york the lox is the best also
if you are a tourist do not expect a mcdonalds type employee at the counter
they are charactewr in their own new york way
Excellent bagels and shmears! They have every kind of bagel, and the prices can't be beat
The service is great, and the quality and value are spectacular
They have a small area where you can sit and nosh your bagel and coffee and watch the ebb and flow of people outside the window
The Scene Midtown's Buttercup is to the sweet-toothed what pre-Rudy 42nd Street peepshows were to pervs
From the second you enter the close-quartered shop, you're enveloped in a relentless, sensual maelstrom of heavenly scents, ooey-gooey icing and eye-popping frosting swirls
However, just as in the aforementioned establishments, all the goods are ensconced safely in cases--and it's still bad form to press your nose up against the glass
The Goods Ex-Magnolia bakery partner Jennifer Appel's specialty is down-home desserts that caress all the senses
Red Velvet cake and the shop's trademark cupcakes pack a wallop on both the tongue and the eyes (not to mention the thighs)
Pre-order custom cakes or try to re-create the magic at home--Buttercup has claimed enough devotees to warrant its own glossy cookbook
I went there today with my mom, to see if it was as good as the reviews
I have to admit that my cupcake was amazing, although next time I'd like to try a different type of cupcake
I got one with a marshmallow whipped topping on a rich chocolate cupcake
It was incredibly tasty, nice and thick, and left me with a slight tummy ache because I couldn't stop eating it! My mom got a pecan pie bar, and she loved it too! The staff were very helpful and super sweet! I recommend you check this place out for yourself, unlike many other bakeries, these treats taste as good as they look!
I live right by the bakery and, against my better judgement, find myself going in there at least three times a week
The cake is amazing
Pricey, yes, but delicious
The Hummingbird cake is my favorite (a sort of banana-bread cake with cream cheese icing) and the Coconut is #2
As for cupcakes- very tasty, try the red velvet or the classic chocolate with vanilla icing
One last thing- try the chocolate trifle pudding!
just want to share my experience at buttercup
if you are to visit, you MUST get their cheesecake (blueberry swirl is my fave)
i'm very particular when it comes to cheesecakes, but this one really hits the spot :) what makes it so special?? well, first it has almonds?? embedded in the crust and second it's rich yet not sugary
in terms of the cupcakes, i'm not too fond of cupcakes in the general, but their german chocolate was pretty good (has coconut shreds)
enjoy!!!!
Totally overrated
The comments here that talk about the rude staff/management/ownership/etc are right on the money
Take your money elsewhere
I honestly do like their cupcakes
If I'm in the neighborhood, I always buy one
In my opinion, I'm not a fan of the spongy cake itself, but I absolutely adore the icing
Everytime I do buy one, I basically just eat the top half of the cupcake
The cake is soft but a little bit dry, and I've been here a number of times
I always go back for more because of that icing
And I think it tastes even better when you buy some bitter iced coffee; it's such an excellent combo!!
These are the absolute best cupcakes I have ever had
I absolutely LOOOOOOVVVVEEEE them
I stumbled upon the site when I was looking to get a birthday cake for my friend and although I didnt buy a cake there I went to see what they had in store
Let me just say the minute u walk in it's so inviting
The staff is friendly and greet you with a smile not to mention all the good gooey treats that stare at you the minute you walk in
The absolute best is the red velvet cupcake
It's so tasty and creamy and totally not dry at all as some of these other reviewers have stated
I have gone back to even get cupcakes for my staff at work and they love it so much I got them going there now
This is indeed a great place if u want to have dessert with that special someone or just in the mood for a tasty treat
I have had both Magnolia and Buttercup cupcakes and Magnolia is definately better
I was so excited when I saw Buttercup but like the other reviews say
the cupcakes werer DRY and tasteless
I threw my cupcake out after one bite
Definately make the trip down to Magnolia
Stumblied upon Buttercup 2 weeks ago when in town for the weekend and wondered why NYC is so enthralled by cupcakes
If they tasted good it would be one thing, but I was VERY unimpressed by both the devil dog cupcake and the golden with choc
frosting
Both were very dry and to think it cost me $3
50
I could have made 2 dozen tasty cupcakes for that price myself! Then I found out that its a former owner of Magnolia, not surprising considering they too have overpriced dry tasteless cupcakes
The frosting was decent, but for $1
75 each I expect the whole package to be worth it
i work a couple of blocks away from this bakery and never knew it was there, i stopped by based on a lot of these reviews and it was amazing!!!!!! they aren't dry at all, they were really moist and buttery tasting
the frosting was really good
it's hard to find bakeries now this good or that use real buttercream frosting but i def found one here
:)
I went to Buttercup's after reading mostly great reviews on Citysearch, but I was so disappointed! Everything either had too much frosting or was way too dry
It's not worth the prices for mediocre service either, I'm sad to say you can get better results from a Betty Crocker box!
The Red Velvet cupcake is to die for! And my husband is convinced that their mini cheesecakes are the best cheesecake he's ever had (better than Junior's in Brooklyn!)
I think Magnolia is WAY overrated and I despise having to wait in line for a cupcake -- head over to Buttercup instead
Today I tried the red velvet and lemon cupcake
The red velvet was very good and so was the icing
The lemon was good but the icing was a little too tart
Both cupcakes were very moist
Right now I am neutral, I will have to try a few more things so I can give it an accurate rating
After years of listening to the hype, I finally went in, figuring that with all the positive word of mouth, what could be bad? Well, everything I had as a matter of fact
True, I only had half a red velvet cupcake and a tiny piece of a chocolate, chocolate (the rest went in the trash), but I bake enough ( and eat enough) to recognize dry and tasteless
And that was just the cake
The icing was in a category of horrific all its own
I haven't had icing that sweet in


God knows when, if ever
And by the way, sweet does not disguise the tast of vegetable shortening, or whatever they use in lieu of real butter
If there's butter in that icing, I would like to see what they do with it to remove all the flavor and creaminess

pasta is al dente
sauces are wonderful
all around great place
also, when i was waiting to be seated the bartender gave great service and mixed a mean cocktail for me
highly reccomended
I ordered the General Tso Un-Chicken and it was delicious
Hunan Delight has one page in their menu full of Vegetarian dishes
This restaurant has the best vegetarian dishes around -- the spicy sesame chicken and vegetarian hot and sour soup are fantastic
great, authentic, unpretentious mexican food
really good tacos (so cheap!) especially the carne asada and pastor (roast pork)
my friend had the chicken enchilada with mole and loved it
great service: quick but laid back--you can relax and enjoy your food and beer without being rushed
must try the burritos and chalupas next time
one of my new favorite spots
THE BEST MEXICAN FOD IN NEW YORK I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES MEXICAN FOOD
Best Fried Chicken in Park Slope! The chicken and french fries, especially the curly fries are excellent! It's open late and the service is always friendly, even when you get there when they are about to close
When you get there at one in the morning or later you're drunk
They understand
This chicken is pressure fried and is just the crispiest, moistest, most flavorful chicken you could hope for
Do not order mashed potatoes
No matter how bad you want that mashed potatoes fried chicken combo
Come to JFK resolute and excited about the fact that you are going to eat the best fried chicken and french fries imaginable
Those wishing to throw caution to the wind will request cheese on their scrumptious fries or curly fries
Ask not what the country can do for you but what you can do for the country
is JFK not JFK Fried Chicken
Their mashed potato is defrosted and powder gravy brought to a boil smeared over in a tiny bucket
The chicken is made in the morning and left on the heater for days
Their ribs remind me of a horror movie and their fries tasted more like mash potatoes as they should be
Service was horrible
They delivered the wrong food to me but would not exchange it
So I ended up eating ribs and chicken, fries and mash potatoes for 12
99 for ONE person and it was horrible food
I disagree with the poster below
Ate at Red Hot once - noodles were stale, service was ridiculously slow and forgetful
No excuse during lunch with only about 3 tables in the place
However, Number One Garden delivers within minutes - even if your order is below most other places' minimum
Food is good and a bargain
Can't compete with Red Hot on 7th ave for fresh ingredients
Still, for fast, cheap, solid junk Chinese food it's fine
If you go in, make sure to listen to the unbelievably loud microphone that the folks at the counter use to dictate orders to the cooks who stand about two feet behind them
From the service to the decorations to the warm greeting that you receive when you walk through the door, Java makes you feel like youre at home
The food is incredible and prices are even better
Being an Indo girl and raised in an Indonesians kitchen, I know good from bad and this is defiantly good!!! Salam!
The Indonesian food is slightly toned down for Yankee palates, but delicious and very reasonable
The staff are friendly and helpful and never rush you, and while your date's in the loo you can enjoy looking at all the interesting Indonesian artwork
We got the Rijstaffel for 2 last Saturday night and it was delicious - a great deal as well - soup, salads, 12 dishes to share, rice, dessert, coffee or tea, etc
for $29
50!  The service was great - our waiter was just lovely
He described all the dishes to us and was very attentive
Looking forward to going back again soon
The lunch special is a great deal
The soup you get is so cool -- tasty and all kinds of interesting ingredients
I got a fish dish (I think it may have been red snapper) with a peppery sauce and it was delicious
The waitstaff (owners?) are really nice and friendly
Great Home Style Indonesian Cooking
Reminds me of how my mother used to cook me dinner when i was younger
Cozy atmosphere
Nice place to take a date out for a romantic evening
Try the Rijstaffel for 2
It's like a 3 course me from soup to salad to a main course and dessert or coffee or tea at the end
This place is Great
10 Stars !!!
I'd say the menu is generally below-average for the neighborhood, but if you want a burger, this is the place to go
And in good weather, you can sit outside
Been there a few times good place to grab a beer some munchies
One of the few place with a decent kids menu
Friendly quick service
I work for a very prestigious company and I was looking to host a day time event at this venue
The manager was extremely rude an his lack of interest in my business was appalling
they must have a very established restaurant to be able to turn away such a valid piece of business
I would never inquire about an event there again and will pass the word on to my colleagues
many of which live in the neighborhood
Friendly and attentive service
Good beer selections
I had the lobster ravioli--good size portion with a delicious vodka cream sauce
My husband had the chicken porcini--he said it was the best meal he's ever had in Park Slope
We've lived here for 2 years and tried just about every restaurant on Seventh Ave
I will definitely go back
I have been to Johnny Mack's many times simply because it is less than 1 block from my house
I would never travel to come to this place
The food is average, the drinks simple, and the clientele boring
I can olny recommend this place if you have no car and means to travel anywhere else
One funny thing is the group of four regulars that sit all day and drink Jeigermeister, they are Brooklyn's finest
This is a great place to be on a nice summer night
You can sit out side and catch the action of the neighborhood or hang out at the bar and catch up with some friends
Either way, you will have a great time at Johny Mack's
The food is great, especially the burgers!! The staff is friendly and fun! And the atmosphere is great!
Just enough of a sports bar for my boyfriend, and just enough of a stylish restaurant for me
Technically, it's split with a bar side and a restaurant side
I've always eaten on the sport's bar side, because it's more laid back and lively
but even that side is definitely more refined than most straight-up sport's bars
Great food, good selection of beers, and a friendly staff
The bar is also usually bustling with regulars in the evenings
Why bother with at best ok food, a smokey bar miserable service in this day age
I've had brunch and dinner at Johnny Mack's and neither was memorable
The service was pretty lousy, too
The bar is decent, but not somewhere I'd hang out
Rice Thai has great food, fast delivery and is reasonably priced
If you like Thai food and live in Park Slope this is the place to go
I've eaten at and order from this restaurant

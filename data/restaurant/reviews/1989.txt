hoping to find a hidden treasure among the dinginess, but all I found was tepid Vietnamese food served up by a sad-looking staff who probably hadn't seen sunlight in weeks
At one point, the restaurant changed name and owner, so perhaps that's the explanation
In any event, the noodles were overcooked, the chicken rubbery, and the vegetables did not appear fresh
The prices were comparable to other restaurants in Chinatown
You probably can find better food for the same value elsewhere in Chinatown
The basement decor would have been tolerable if the food had been authentic and good, but unfortunately that was not the case
The pho was watered down, the vegetables looked wilted, and the grilled dishes appeared fried, not grilled
I took Vietnamese guests there, and they were far from impressed
Last Friday, a Vietnamese friend of mine invited me to Doyers Restaurant
We had ordered Grilled Shrimp Summer Rolls, Shrimp on Sugar Cane, Veg
Crepe, Caramel Chicken w
Ginger Root, Spicy Basil Squids
I had shared with her all the dishes
They are all delicious and we enjoyed the meal very much
If you like Vietnamese food, I recommend you try this Chinatown restaurant
Whoever wrote the citysearch editorial obviously knows nothing about Vietnamese food
I've been going to Doyers for over 10 years and it is the ONLY restaurant I will go to for Vietnamese food
It's authentic, inexpensive, and quality
It's not a restaurant to go to if ambience or decor are priorities on your list
but it is the perfect place if you just want GOOD and AUTHENTIC Vietnamese food
I like their shrimp papaya salad which has no oil at all
Among their variety of summer rolls, grilled shrimp summer rolls are the best
Their crepe w
shrimp pork is crispy and delicous when wrap with lettuce and mint leaves
My other favorites are beef cubes w
onion on watercress, grilled lemon grass eel, and satay beef rice stick soup
When i was first introduce to this restaurant i thought it was just another Vietnamese restaurant but a friend of mine got me hook to this place
The food are excellent the decor is a little drapy the service are good especially the young waiters there ( very friendy )
They recommend some of the best dishes there such as the Grill shrimp with thin rice noodles, the crepe, soft shell crabs, and the summers rolls are great
One more thing usually the restroom in chinatown stinks but this restaurants restroom is the cleanest, i have to mention that
This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in NY city no doubt in my mind
I think it is the closest vietnamese food i had since i was back in vietnam 2 years ago
Thanks Kathy for introducing me to this place!
I happened upon this restuarant a couple of years ago and have been addicted ever since
I used to frequent China Town for the variety of Chinese fare but now I totally bypass all that and head straight for Vietnam Restaurant atleast every other week
The taste is so unique and always leaves me satisfied
The food isn't greasy or overly-spiced or salty, all the ingredients are in perfect harmony
And the portions are perfect and its a great value!  No wonder everytime I think about it my mouth waters!
i was eat in this restaurant and i was like cha gio is vietnamese spring rolls and also soup pho with extra large bowl hmm
yummmmmmyy
what 'bout service? i recommend thai son has a good service
Some folks may be disturbed at the Chinese speaking waiters, but one must remember that they're in Chinatown and that the waiters also speak Vietnamese (very common)
With that aside, the service is always quick and prompt but sometimes a tad rushed given how crowded the restaurant is during dinner and weekends
The prices won't break your wallet / purse, but you'll certainly get your money's worth out of it
Bowls of pho are huge, the appetizers have generous propotions and the entrees are decent sized
Always a treat for those folks who are patient and hungry for Vietnamese food
Will be back soon
I went to this place this afternoon and made an order for 'take out'
I didn't expect any good service, since it was just a 'take out'
However, 10 minutes later I was still standing before the frontdesk and looked at people, who came in later than me, enjoying their food
I got some not polite replies, when I tried to remind them
Maybe, that's the way they deal with people without seat, but I will definitely refuse this manner
I left this res with money back
I hope everybody can be aware of their bad service (not food, but attitude)
heard rave reviews from my friends about this restaurant and had high hopes going in


prices were average but the food was definately not authentic
went with my parents (we're vietnamese) and were disappointed with the fare
they were skimpy with meat/filling for the bi cuon, spring rolls, and egg rolls and the pho was average
to top if off, they didn't even use the right type of noodles for the bun thit nuong
all in all, i have to say the west coast rules when it comes to good, cheap, authentic vietnamese food
I found the food to be pretty good, although not the best Vietnamese food I've had
The spring rolls could use a little less dough and more filling
And the service is a bit shaky
Everything comes all at once, and it takes forever to get more water
and you will get thirsty after eating all that fish sauce!
This place is fabulous- The pho is excellent, and the summer rolls are very fresh
The vermicelli dishes are also excellent
I went there for a birthday recently, and the staff was so nice! They helped with a cake we had brought, turned down the restaurant lights, and all joined in singing happy b-day! I'd highly recommend Thai Son for their food and service!
Thai So'n is a decent vietnamese restaurant
The Pho was okay, but we've had better; the noodles seemed too soft and the soup didn't have much flavor
Likewise the spring rolls seemed a little bland
The Thai ice coffee was a bit too strong
Nevertheless, the restaurant is roomy and clean, and the service is decent
Finally, the prices are a pretty good value
The Scene Chinatown aficionados know this relative newcomer for its exceptionally juicy soup dumplings, and the restaurant brings something upbeat to this still lower-income neighborhood: a bright, pleasant, cafe atmosphere with a robust menu
Peach walls, metal mesh chairs, and rainbow neon ceiling tubes lend a perky '80s feel, and the roomy booths and plentiful seating help avoid table-sharing occurrences
The Food The cuisine offers a refreshing change from New York's Cantonese-dominated Chinatown
Whole talapia fish gets fried and then braised to melting tenderness in a rich garlic-ginger brown gravy; cold, aromatic beef slices come marbled with succulent hints of fat; Jia Jiang noodles (served warm instead of the traditional cold) are topped with a savory, not-too-salty black bean sauce, crunchy sprouts, and cucumber slivers
Unlike many Chinatown restaurants, tasty dessert choices abound: Peanut butter lovers must sample the warm, chewy moi-gee rice balls, generously dusted with peanut powder and oozing with molten sesame seed filling
I've eaten there twice and both times the customer service was terrible! After the first time, I thought, maybe the waitstaff was just having a bad day
But after having eaten there again and being treated in such an outrageous fashion, I think the waitstaff is just plain rude in general
It wasn't even busy and they were rushing us to finish and talking to us like we were a nuisance
The steamed pork and crab buns(their signature dish) were also not that good--alot of flour but not alot of meat inside
As for price, there are plenty of Shanghai restaurants in Chinatown that are just as inexpensive with better food and without a doubt much better customer service
Order a beer and then sit and wait for the steamy, salty soup dumplings that burst with a snap
After the initial rush of briny soup in the back of your mouth, the delicate and sweet pork filling is like an added gift that makes your chopsticks quickly rush back to the next delicate package laying in the woven steamer at the table
Cold beer and hot soup dumplings
It doesn't get much better
Shabby decor? I think a previous reviewer must have been talking about their previous location
Their new location is all neon and Hong-Kong-Action-Movie-y
I half expect Chow Yun Fat to burst in a door and shoot a bunch of people
But he never does
Instead, juicy buns appear on my table and I eat them all
Crab + pork + steam + bun = formula for delicious
The other dishes are good, too, but I go for the juicy buns
AND YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!!
I've been to this place for several times now
I was quite satisfied with the overall service

Don't expect American service, this is typical slow French style service, but they're there when you ask for them
It's hard to find reasonably priced, good restaurants in midtown
La Bonne Soupe is a real treat
The house wines are good and a bargain, the soupe meals are a great value
The crepes are outstanding (Tuesday is crepe night)
The cheese fondue is also a treat
I have to say that I have tried almost everything on the menu and have never been let down
The service is very French (read slow), but not terrible by any means
Gets crowded during peak hours
NB - reservations for parties larger than 2 only
The creme Andalouse is the best cream of tomato soup I have ever had
The fondue au frommage is hit or miss but the total package is guaranteed great every time
I had french onion soup yesterday for lunch with a friend of mine and it was a good experience
I don't know if it was real French food, but tasted great
It came with a wonderfully dressed salad, dessert, and coffee or wine
They were very friendly and helpful, but rather slow on service and a bit difficult to get their attention
Regardless, the whole experience was great, and will definitely go back there
Great atmosphere, too
If you are a cheese person this is the place to go for it
We went with a larger group and shared fondue at the table!! It was very yummy
The rest of the menu is good to have too if you are with people who are not as excited about Fondue!! Good omelettes, steaks and the soups are to die for!! The French Onio soup is some of the best I have ever had!!
I've been coming here for years, since I was a little girl
I'm a die hard soupe prix-fixe lover
It's by far the best and tastiest French deal around
Real French atmosphere and delicious, simple bistro food for reasonable prices - and in midtown, yet! The lemon chicken is especially good, as are the soups
Creme caramel is delicious and the house salad dressing is out of this world
The space is small but cozy with lots of regulars, and it's a fine place to dine alone, too
The atmosphere is charming, the waitstaff polite, and the food is tremendous
I got the crepes, and they were perfect
Also, don't leave without trying their famous soup--it is amazing! It goes from empty to line out the door in instants though, so get here early!
ive gone here every christmastime with my family
i get the cheese fondue everytime - everyone who's with me agrees that its the best theyve ever had! cute french bistro with history
Love this place! La Bonne Soupe always pleases everyone in the party
Avoid the lunch and dinner hours, tho, as the line can go out the door!
Excellent tasting crepes for a quick lunch
The place got crowded and it took a while to get the check, but I'd certainly go again
What a sweet little find!
My husband and I enjoyed a quick lunch here
The French Onion soup was very tasty
A perfect size lunch (and price) with salad, bread, dessert and glass of wine
Crepes were ok
I actually look forward to the experience but I was disappointed to know the onion soup is not authentic French (which somehow is the north american type French soup with heavy cheese content)
I actually order a lobster bisque but it is very watery
Anyway, great price for the soup menu! I've read the website of the restaurant and I think it can get better with it's objective (to serve good food with a sense of humour)
My daughter and I stopped by for a late lunch/early dinner
if was absolutely fabulous
the best French Onion soup I have ever tasted
bread was excellent and so was the house wine selection!  Tres bon!
Actually, La Bonne Soupe's great for grabbing a quick but delicious pre-theater dinner, as well as for luxurious luncheons
The soups are well-prepared, and though the non-soup entries almost seem superfluous (and a trifle scanty), they're generally good, too
Be warned: this unassuming little place can get jampacked -- it's an undersung favorite
The Scene  Salsa music, swaying palms and a courteous, accommodating waitstaff are this 40-year-old stalwart's formula for transporting customers to Batiste-era Cuba
It's a great spot for groups and a favorite among celebs--Gloria Estefan and Marc Anthony are regulars
The Food  Stick with traditional fare
The moist, hearty Cuban tamale, served with a mild pepper sauce, makes a nice starter, as does yuca con mojo, a surprisingly delicious boiled root vegetable
The best entrees have the least appetizing translations: ropa vieja, "old clothes," is meltingly tender shredded skirt steak served with fried and fresh vegetables; veca frita, "fried cow," is toothsome churrasco steak on mashed plantains
Pork dishes are also good
But steer clear of the flavorless seafood, and beware that the heavy-handed kitchen tends to overcook chicken and fish
Desserts are achingly sweet and gloopy--have another mojito instead
This place was great! Took my friend out for her birthday and we loved it
I had a reservation and we were seated immediately
The music was fun and lively and the ambience was great
The appetizers we ordered were very small (plaintains stuffed with spiced meat and vegetables) but abs
delecious
The main course-- I got arroz con pollo, was tasty enough and the price was reasonable especially as they gave huge portions
The highlight was def
our mojitos
I got raspberry mojito and quite frankly it was one of the best mojitos I've ever had and probably one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had, period
All in all, really delighted and my friend had a great time
As a Cuban-American, I had heard many raves from my (non-Cuban) friends about Victor's, I decided to check it out during Restuarant Week
Not only did they not have the full menu (only 2 of 3 apps) they also had run out of the Lechon (a signature dish) and the menu was misrepresented online (listing a shrimp dish) which was later removed! I was told there was no cocktail list although there is quite an extensive one online, perhaps that was a ploy to order the blah, overpriced Sangria pitcher
But wait! There's more
latin house music was blaring in the (freezing) dining room so much so that I had to yell at my date so he can hear me (very unromantic)
Our waiter was friendly and apologetic, although I felt rushed, but I guess I didn't mind, it was not a restaurant I wanted to be in much longer, or ever again I dare say
Highly recommended to anyone who has no idea was Cuban food is like, and/or has a lot of time money to spend on overpriced, mediocre restaurants
In short, if only the real deal was as glossy as the website
it's not easy mixing traditional cuban food with style
i think this restaurant does a great job of presenting the cuban culture without typecasting it
although the food does not have as much garlic and spices as a native like myself would want, it is still a great choice for those in search of something different
the decor is wonderful, the music hits home, the service is great!
Get your mojo going and stop by for after work mojitos
Great place to start with friends before hitting the Village
The food was present very pretty, however the food was not as good as authentic Cuban Food taste, this restaurant is not recomended for Latin people instead for people who are trying Cuban food for the first time
The service was excellents, however the price was too expensive for the flavor and the portions
The first time I visited Victor's Caf, it was on 71st Street and Columbus
I have always been a fan of Victor's black beans and the Vaca Frita
I visited New York recently with my family and took them to Victor's for dinner
In my book, this place continues to be the #1 Cuban restaurant in the U
S
I live in Miami, and no other Cuban restaurant here can compare with the quality of food and overall experience Victor's offers
Magnifico!
fOOD- Cold, Small Portions Black Bean and Rice Excellent DRINKS- WAYYYYYY OVER PRICED AND NOT THAT GOOD FOR THOSE PRICES Decor- Nice DIDN'T GET A THANK YOU FOR A 18% TIP WHICH A TIP WASN'T DESERVED SERVICE- I hadn't been to New York in a year and the taxi situation has gotten worse for Afro-Americans
I had trouble getting taxi's all day so I asked the hostess if someone could hail me a taxi she said I would have to do it myself
I explained to her the situation but it didn't matter i was on my own
We were extremely disappointed by our last meal at Victor's
The meal was merely adequate and the wine was seriously overpriced
We made the mistake of ordering from the prix fixe menu
The dishes ended up costing the same as those on the regular menu, but the portions were smaller - yes, smaller
I made a reservation at 8:30 and was still NOT seated by 9:30
Everytime we went to ask them what's going on, they keep saying they are waiting for that ONE table to leave, I can't beleive that the restaurant was waiting for that ONE 4 person table

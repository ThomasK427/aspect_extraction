My wife had the potato pancakes which were very good
Great selection of German beer
Our waitress was very nice and friendly
Heated rolls would have been nice
Bathroom kinda dirty
Other than that a fun place with excellent German food
Look forward to going back
Food was below avg
, with poor service
Wrong dish was delivered waitress argued with us when we told her it was not what was ordered
Portions were no great shakes
I got the sausage platter that came with 4 small links, a huge mound of sauerkraut
My friend orders the same but got a pork chop that was just ok, a bit dry not much flavor
He kept the dish so he didn't have to have a 10 min debate with the waitress
Beer was good, but had better desserts from freezer section at local grocery store
Would go back for the bar, but not to eat
Rolf's
how can you not like the christmas decorations and friendly waitresses
Unless, of course, you were never able to expereience these facets due to the perrenially unfriendly cast of host/hostesses
Make no mistake, the food is fantastic and authentic Bayerisch fair
However, after dining on three different occassions what I really most is the ultra narrow and crowded bar and the inability to get in or out of your table because of the cramped spaces
I would still eat at Rolf's on an off night out of season
Rolf's has some of the best German food in the city
The place is very small and often times uncomfortable
Christmas is an excellent time here as they really do-up the place well
Expect to pay $22 for an average plate
apps run about $9-12 and Beers are $8
50
Dinner for two (including a few drinks and dessert) will run you about $125
Make a reservation for this place
You'll never get a table at the time you reserved it for
but it means that you only wait 20-30 minutes for it
For a better deal and equally great food, try Heidelberg on 2nd ave
uptown
It has more room, great menu and overall a warmer waitstaff
Comfortable bar area and quiet, romantic eating area
Ive not had their food yet, but have enjoyed the friendly bar staff and enjoyed the free finger sandwiches on Sunday afternoons
A GREAT meal and one of the most encompassing atmospheres I've ever been in, it definitely warrants a 2nd visit! Not too hard on the wallet and a WONDERFUL selection of meals and appetizers and good portions as well! Watch out for the vodka, though, don't underestimate it
Potato Pancakes! YUM! Just like 'muti' used to make! I read the other reviews and think they  are all accurate, except the part about the German Ketchup, which is an old joke about Heinz, and I guess this guy didn't get it
The waitresses are adorable and the guy with the glasses is sadly missed
He was a sweetie
The sausages, they tell me, are all from a Greenpoint butcher who supplies meat to places like Peter Luger
The Xmas decorations are missed as well, but they tell me they put them up again after Halloween
CAN'T WAIT!!!
We just stumbled upon this fantastic New York treaure
From the exterior it doesn't look like much, but once you enter it is a completely transformed world
The saurbraten is absolutely to die for, I have searched all over for it's equal and have yet to find it
Trust me, this is the place to be if you love German foodl!!
BEST SPORTS BAR IN UNION SQUARE AREA IF YOUR INTERESTED IN SEEING A GAME [OVER A DOZEN SCREENS WITH 3 LARGE SCREENS SATILITE WITH HIGH DEFINITION!]
THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT THE SELECTION IS BETTER THEN MOST BAR/RESTAURANTS
DRINKS ARE NOT OVERPRICED HAPPY-HOUR HAS SOME GREAT DEALS
TO TOP IT ALL OFF, THEY HAVE SOME VERY PRETTY LADIES HELPING OUT BOTH BEHIND THE BAR TAKING YOUR ORDER
As far as NYC goes, this is the place to hang for great bar food and a great jukebox! You can't beat the prices or service
I live in the neighborhood and I go there a lot, very consistent
also has a pool table
if you want teasty food and some drinks and don't want to spend $$$ this is the place to go!!!
In a town that is filled with uber-hip lounges with velvet ropes and the likes, Barfly is a no-nonsense drinking person's bar
The food is exceptional (mostly bar-food, some entrees)
The Bartenders are super nice awful funny
It's a great place to watch your favorite team play
while sipping a pint
waiting for your wings and Burger
Very good food
AND at very good prices
It's not often in Manhatten you can say that
Beautiful neighborhood bar with great Miller Lite specials before 8PM and weather permitting, you can sit outside and enjoy the scenery while you enjoy not just bar food but some really well made meals and terrific drinks (must try the flyjuice!)
The bartenders can't be beat! Good times
The ambiance, atomsphere, food, and the staff are GREAT!!! The bar is a maple/mahogony finish (Please don't take off for spelling) it beautiful and please to the eye--BTW, GREAT JUKEBOX!  Highly recomended!
This place is cool to get a quick take out lunch
For $5 you get a plate of juicy meet, Mexican rice, and black beans, and fresh tortillas
Not for sitdowns
good food, good people, good service
can't get much better
:D
In Short The Grand Saloon's traditional old-style copper facade emulates the classic old New York bar -- with TVs
There's plenty of room for watching the big game on well-placed screens that don't overwelm the bar scene
The kitchen turns out a long list of American bar food staples, like burgers and fries
The Grand Salonn is not only an incredibly filthy resturant it is also famous for the worst service in the city
Avoid this place at all costs
If you really want to be treated like a lower form of life visit Maureen Oshea as she tends bar Tues-Fri (she provides special service for her friends)
The ower, Tony Spilone, is your text book absentee landlord allowing people like Maureen to run this place into the ground
After spending 15 mins
there you will learn every one of Maureen's half baked opinions especially of you while she disses the customers and shorts the drinks
This place is a sewer
BAD SERVICE and RUDE! On a Sunday night, I ordered 2 burges from Grand Saloon
As usual I was very specific with my address
After an hour, I called and was told that the delivery guy couldnt fine my address and came back with the food
I gave them all the info again and it was exactly what they had
I said I did not wnt hour old food and they promised to remake it
A few minutes later, the guy showed up with cold burger and fries
I called again, the same woman answered and refused to do anything about it saying she doesn't know what they do in the kitchen
About an hour later, the delivery guy showed up at my door offering my money back if I gave him the food back
Of course, 2
5 hours after I ordered my dinner, it had already been eaten
Burgers are good, decent pint of Guinness
Lots of space, but they get an odd crowd in there
Jukebox isn't much to speak of
Service is sketchy, not always happy to have a customer in an empty restaurant
This non-descript bar near the corner of 23rd street and 3rd avenue is a nice find
The burgers are fantastic as well as most of the other food

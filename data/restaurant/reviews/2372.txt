I guess if you've had a bad experience then you might have ordered the wrong thing
Had the gandolette-an herb and cheese filled pasta covered in the world's most amazing cream sauce
It is the type of dish I dreamed about for two years in between my first and second meal at the restaurant
Try the caprese (mozerella and tomatoes) if it's summer time
Wonderful fresh flavors-perfect to begin the meal
Gambelli himself makes the meal and experience wonderful
He sat my parties both times and personally stopped by to ask about our meals
After my second experience with all the disruption he met us at the door, apologizing profusely and handed my friend and I a bunch of roses
A lovely, classy gesture to end an amazing meal
Recommended by a friend for our visit to NYC
Had reservations and while waiting to be seated tried to get a drink at the bar
Obviously, the female bartender wasn't interested in serving three ladies as she ignored completely while serving every male and couple in sight
Once seated the service didn't improve
Our waiter informed us to order quickly because the kitchen was busy and promptly disappeared to never return
Had to flag someone down to order another glass of lously house chianti
I figured asking for wine list might be too difficult for them
As for the food
veal saltimbocca was good as was the manicotti, but the seafood dish was horrible and fishy smelling
Even the bread wasn't great
Overall, it was a terrible experience and we were treated very poorly
Had dinner here and had the chicken with peppers and mushrooms, Salad and a Coke $54
I about choked when I saw the bill
I like another reviewer don't mind paying for good food
The food was just fair at best, I've had much better food at other places
I think most of the expense is taken up by the many servers they have on staff
There were 6 servers standing around watching me eat but they never asked if I needed anything or even offered me water
We arrived with a group of twelve and, rather than reviewing the menu, we asked the waiter to have the chef prepare a meal for all of us
The selection was outstanding and delicious
Mr
Giambelli will sit you at your table and shake hand
if you have been there before he will even remember your name
and ask you about your family
the food is great, great wine selection
It is a bit pricy, but worth every penny
LOVE IT
TAKES YOU BACK TO 70'IES
BUT I JUST LOVE IT
GOD BLESS
KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD WORK
LOVE THE PASTA GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE
Went there on a Wednesday night
Sat on the second floor with the piano player, who entertained us all night
Even better was the food, had shrimp wrapped in prosciutto, followed by lamb chops, and of course a double macchiato to finish it all off
Highly Recommended
If your looking for a quiet place with some fantastic food, you need to try this restaurant
Service made you feel like you had known them for years, overall one of my best dining experiences in New York
I took my wife there for a romantic diner after work one evening a month or two ago
The place was packed, and we didn't have a reservation; however, we were seated quickly
The waiter accidently spilled water on our table, and the manager checked up on our meal periodically and offered us a free after diner drink
The service and food is excellent!!!
My wife and I were vacationing in NYC last week
After a disappointing experience at a highly touted restaurant the previous night, Bruno was a most welcome find
From the Reggiano cheese and wonderful breads served upon being seated, the wonderful tuna cappaccio and impeccably fresh oysters we had for appetizers, and the risotto with quail I had and the seafood couscous that my wife thoroughly enjoyed, this was one of the finest Italian restaurants I've eaten at in a long time! The waiter was also very helpful with his recomendations, both for food and wine
Highly recommended!
A friend and I went there for the first time on a Friday night and had an amazing time
The staff is attentive and cordial
The place is impecably clean
The food was superb
It's perfect for a romantic evening
I will certainly recommend it and look forward to my next visit
I and six friends happened upon this bar one saturday night in Feburary
We were on our way from queens to the Village for a night out when we stopped in for a quick one
6 hour later we were still there! The Music was awesome! Pie Boys Flat, they were called
The bar was rocking all night and busy as they were, Liam and Peter (the bartenders) kept the drinks coming and the fun going (till a little after 4!)
Incredable bar with great people all round!
Stopped by during happy hour on a weeknight with my boyfriend
The service was terrible
It took us about 15 minutes to get a drink even though we were seated at the bar and about the same amount of time to get the attention of the bartender for a menu
Rather than wait until closing to place our order, we left and went somewhere else
It draws a late 20's, early 30's type crowd and they have music on the weekend although if the service that we received is typical, there are better options in the area
A rare find
a laid-back nonpretentious bar in manhattan, which is also alot of fun
When I ran across it one evening, I walked into a bar with a welcoming bartender, friendly customers, and an amazing live band
Since then, this bar is on the top of my list
A cozy Irish bar where the waitresses are actually Irish
No fake accents here
The food was outstanding
I highly recommend the Chicken Pot Pie
no way in hell your mom makes a better one
Waitress was a little pushy about ordering but the overall experience was great
Very nice bar/restaurant
The food is wonderful and varied
Service is very friendly
Price are more than honest
I went there and also received the worst service, it took 20 minutes to get water
The food came at least 30 minutes after we ordered it, which was strange because it tasted like it was straight out of a chef boyardee can, so that should have taken what 2 minutes to open the can and heat it up? The only ok thing about this place was the piano player who was good but attracted all of the middle aged tone deaf drunks so that was pretty entertaining although very annoying
My husband, myself and 2 other couples went to Mimi's on Saturday night and we had a ball
We were seated near the piano player (great guy), knew all the songs and sang along and were even asked to come up and join him at his piano
Before long, other diners were singing along
We had great service and felt extremely welcome from the moment we walked in
The food was a pleasant bonus to the fun that we were having
We can't wait to return
I have visited Mimi's for 8 years
It is a glimpse of New York and New Yorkers before the city was prettied up for the tourists
Yes, the manager, waitresses, and bartender may appear a little rude
but they are REAL, they will not kiss your derriere for the tips
They can also be the sweetest people if they are treated as deserved
The food is average but unlike elsewhere, you won't leave hungry
The regulars are characters and appear to be part of some living Broadway play
they're actually remnants of real New Yorkers

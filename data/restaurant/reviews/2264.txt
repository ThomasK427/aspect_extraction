Not because I'm one of those All-You-Can-Eat types, but because there is just so much beautiful food! From their italian cold cuts, variety of olives, sauteed/grilled veggies such as leeks, whole garlic, asparagus, to their smoked fishes, made-to-order eggs, fresh pastry, excellent cheeses, various meat casseroles, stewed fruits such as figs, peaches, etc
to their delectable desserts
it is a total feast
I go a few times a year and we sit for a few hours, gorging ourselves
If I had one complaint it would be the rather complacent, apathetic waitstaff, who, for the tips they must earn, could try to at least pretend they like their jobs
I wasn't impressed the second time around
There's no reservations for less than 8 ppl, so we 6 stood on line for over an hour
Foodwise: Sandwiches - ok
The scones - very good, although it shrunk in size from the last time I was here
Dessert was definitely skimpy this time
There was only one tiny dessert per person
To pay $29 for afternoon tea for that little amount of food is definitely not worth it
Here's my bit of advice: You can come one time for the experience, because ambience-wise it's very nice
Other than that, there are definitely better places for afternoon tea in the city that is worth the money
Another note, the place was only supposed to automatically add gratuities to parties of 8 or more
they added it to ours anyways
This is the last time I'm going to the Palm Court for afternoon tea
Knowing they don't take high tea reservations, we were concerned about getting seated on this Friday afternoon, but we showed up af 4pm and were surprised to be seated right away (even wearing jeans!)
Our first brush with service was far from right away, though, so be prepared to wait several minutes (10+) for your waiter to show up; once he did, however, service was great
We ordered the deluxe high tea for 2 - most of the food served was ho-hum, except for the scones and clotted cream, which were divine
The constant flow of tourists peering over your table as they walked through the hotel gets a bit annoying, but I guess that's part of the overall experience
Overall, food is only ok, but it makes for great people watching and a fun experience
The Sunday brunch is a gourmand food fest
It excells in variety and quantity, but is not top-notch
Even in the summer, I dream of this dish, it's that good!! Nuff said!!
I trek up to Mee's from Brooklyn JUST for the curry soup
I curse the other locations for not having it on their menus
We order from Mee once a week, sometimes more
The food is very good for non-Chinatown cuisine
Delivery is usually quick and they hardly ever mess up an order
The Sesame Chicken Special, Capital White Meat Chicken with Black Mushrooms and Ma Po Tofu are my three favorite non-noodle dishes
Overall, Mee is cheap, good and reliable - what else could you want from Chinese takeout?
This noodle shop offers good-value, tasty Chinese food as an alternative for those who don't want to make the trek to Chinatown
Reasonable prices and the quick delivery, too!
I've been eating at Mee's for a year, if you're going there and have high expectations, i suggest a little bit of everything soup, or noodles with peking meat sauce
If you want something cheap and delicious, yet very very filling, i recommend a carton of plain rice, and a serving of sesame wontons
Ask for a large plain container aswell
Dump rice into large container, sesame dumplings, and wow
what a meal for a little over 3 dollars
;-)
I tried this place last night based on the two other reviews posted
You'd be wise to steer clear
Delivery took over an hour, and the food was quite possibly the worst Chinese I've ever had in NYC
They couldn't even do steamed chicken right, as it was grizzly and fatty
There isn't a price low enough to justify eating here
I've been in NYC for 3 years and this is the single BEST delivery food I've found! Great taste - great helpings, fantastic prices and they will customize my curry chicken by adding or removing anything (I like it with cashew nuts and hold the string beans)
Try them out - they're great!
Great food, fast service
Huge choice
They have fast delivery
Hang up the phone and get the door bell! Nice people
I had a very filling lunch for $10 (tax and tip included)
I also went for dinner with clients and was impressed with the huge portions of the sushi and rolls
The service was attentive serving hot dishes right into plates and bowls as they came out and they changed plates at every course
They even served delicious fruits and yokan on the house
I don't know what was going on in the basement
Drink Club members were bringing back all kinds of exotic reports
Upstairs was quiet and uncrowded
Lucky for us! Our numbers kept increasing and the incredibly accommodating staff allowed us to move three times as we grew
The atmosphere, at first seemed a bit stuffy, but maybe it was only the table cloths
The staff was friendly, and helpful
The large space accommodating to our various requests
Sometimes service was a bit slow, and we had to ask for salads, water, etc a couple of times, but this was all done with good humor and no resentment
The food was just okay-- but that's as expected
New York just can't do Mexican food right
--Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers
My friends took me to Iguana to celebrate my 21st birthday
It has a very elegant decor and deviates from your typical mex restaurant experience
Entrees were a little pricey (for students, that is) and over half of us were vegetarians and there were only 2 entrees we could order, but other than that, I had a blast
The waiters made me wear a huge sombrero as the bday girl and that was great! The margaritas are probably the BEST i've tasted
EXTREMELY strong and quite large too
They're liberal with their alcohol and have like 60 tequilas available to choose from
I just wanted to have a good time with my friends, so we went to Iguana
It was my first time there, and i really liked it
I had the chicken tacos before i went to the downstairs club
the food was really tasty, and the margaritas were really strong, and delicious
i really liked the stawberry one,
after an hour they had opened downstairs and they played a lot of spanish music and reggeatone
i loved the place , it is very good the have a party there or celebrate
i will definitely go back, and hook up with more cute guys
me and my husband wanted to go to Iguana for such a long time already
finally we got there and we were not disappointed they had 25 flavours of margaritas and mojitos,tasty
i ordered a corn chowder for myself and the chicken enchiladas, i was happy with my choice, my husband ordered a house salad, which was very fresh and crispy, with a light dressing
after that he had the salmon , very delicious
for dessert we ordered a fried ice cream
you gotta try that
the best in the town!!!!!! we will go back- tasty food , nice service, recommended
We celebrate my friends birthday, we had a really good time
Excellent food, not to mention the drinks, coctails
Best margaritas l have had for a long time
The most helpful, frendliest was the hostess
Service was ok
Other tahn that, we left very happy, satysfied
I had my wedding reception this past summer at the Iguana
We had a wonderful dinner upstairs in the dining room and a dance party to follow in their club area downstairs
Everyone had a great time - we got lots of compliments on the great food drinks and pretty authentic atmosphere
The whole staff made it so perfect
They were extremely attentive added details we didn't even ask for - strawberries on the champagne glasses, lots of candles in the club, etc, etc, etc! Nino, the manager, is the BEST
He was so laid back accommodating
He took the lead in making it a spectacular event

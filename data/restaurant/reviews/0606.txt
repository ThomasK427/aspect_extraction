No problems with the service compared to the other reviews, but the quality was terrible
The coq au vin tasted like it was made with canned mushroom gravy, I think the mashed potatoes were from a powder mix
For the steak frites, the steak was bland and tough and the frites seemed to be from frozen
And the olive oil they served with bread to start had absolutely no taste
If a french bistro can't pull off the basic French bistro dish of steak frites, they shouldn't be allowed to be in the French food category
Don't eat here
I've been here a few times and the service is 80% of hte time horrific
Went here early this year for brunch and left the place even more hungry and upset
We were seated promptly but had to wait close to an hour for food that never came
What disgusted me most was the nonchalance of the servers
no apologies, no explanations
they simply avoided passing our way
a courteous we apologize but we are extremely busy might have made the situation a little better
Walked out we did
Couldn't agree more with the table of four's recent review
Went Sat night - the food was OK (a bit bland), the service tried to be helpful, but there were some serious disconnects between the waitstaff, mgr, and kitchen
We must have waited close to 50 mins for our entrees (which were pretty simple to make)
Also, they ran out of bread and had to serve us Rainbo Wheat Bread - at a French restaurant! There were other tables who had sat before us not being attended to or served, including one table who had wine spilled all over them
They did not even get a fully comped meal
Come here for the bar, not the restaurant
We were a party of four, and after a long wait, were seated in a freezing corner
It was 25 degrees outside and the heat was barely on
I was wearing my coat and scarf the whole evening
We waited 20 minutes for someone so we could order
We had to ask many times for water and bread
Apparently, the restaurant ran out of bread and so we got white toast
This is a place that prides itself on being very French
So, to have white toast for bread is quite insulting
Anyways, it took them MORE THAN AN HOUR to bring us the food
By then, we were COLD, HUNGRY, and ANGRY
The manager is very nasty
She told us with bad attitude that a one-hour wait is perfectly normal
Finally, we got the check and saw that they had included an 18% gratuity
We couldnt believe their nerve!!!!
Rustic, aged and well-worn Epicerie is the antithesis to the modern, sleek restaurants I usually gravitate towards
However, a lot of Parisian charm from the decor to the service screams sidewalk shop in paris
The food is REALLY good
I enjoyed a pot of mussels while my dining companion had the duck confeit
Both really delicious and decently priced
A great little restaurant to frequent if you're in the mood for french and are looking for a low-key night out
I had enjoyed good brunch there previously, so I went to the Cafe Charbon with 4 friends last Sunday
We ordered at 12:20
At 1:15 we were still waiting for our plates! We didn't even have a tea or a coffoe because there were no clean mugs available
Other customers that were arrived after us were already served
I asked what was happening
No answer, no apologies, no explanations
Finally, they brought 4 plates at 1:40, (we were 5, a French toast was still missing!!!!!!!)
I was really upset!!!!!!!!!!
terrible service
slow and got our appetizer wrong
we ordered 4 of one item and they brought 2
our food arrived after an incredibly long time and was tepid to cold
overpriced for what you get and not terribly flavorful
their Stella on tap was almost flat, i saw the bartender whisking our beers to give them any sort of head
overall a terrible dinner
I cannot say enough about this place
It has a wonderful, unassuming feel, great food, and good service
The mango mojito is delicious, the poulet roti is fantastic, and the waiters/hosts are great
Very friendly
From the moment my friend and I walked in, we felt immediately welcome
The great bar area in the front is a great place to just chill and have a few drinks
The bartender was great and we had an impromptu wine tasting which was fabulous
Desserts were fantastic
Around 11, the dj comes in and people are dancing at their tables
Overall, a wonderful place to have a perfect Friday night
Nothing fancy about this restaurant except its interesting/hidden entrance
You can compare this restaurant to any other chained restaurant with its service and food
out of a score of 100 i would give it a 65
I live very near this place and had an ok brunch the first time I tried it
the food was fine but not great
The second time I attempted to go was out of convenience
it was right in front of us
THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE! So slow and unapologetic
It wasn't crowded
at all
and, yet, our waiter was missing in action the entire experience
We all vowed to never return
Well, in a moment of weakness and again convenience I decided to give in another shot
I left before we were ever seated
I have rarely experienced such rude service
We were completely ignored for 20 minutes waiting for a host/waiter/or anyone! They saw us and others waiting and just looked right through us
The staff watched us and several other couples walk out and just didn't care
I really will NEVER go back!
I have only eaten here once, but I had their mushroom ravioli, and it was great
The seating was a bit cramped, but other than the tables being too close together, I would suggest this place to any one looking for a nice dinner while out on the town
Had great cassoulet there
very rich and flavorful
Best fries I have ever had
I don't know the secret
Beats out even Belgium fry places
Great atmosphere, very cute, moderate prices
I love this place!
I don't understand why most people complain about the service
I went there this past Saturday around 9pm
First had a cheese platter at the bar and then enjoyed a nice dinner with friends
Food and ambiance was great
Our waitress was attentive but also not annoying as some wait staff in restaurants can be
On our way out ~11:30pm the bar area was full also with cool types
I would go there again
If you're looking to be treated in a rude and disrespectful manner, then this is the place for you

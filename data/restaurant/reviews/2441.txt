Too bad the orange flags distracted from our view of Central Park
The menu is tired and the interior is pretty worn
Service was rushed and unfriendly
Our waiter didn't even smile once! This restaurant has the potential to be magical and romantic if only it added exciting and tasty options to its menu, re-hired a new waitstaff and made some repairs to the interior
The chocolate mousse cake was a big dissapointment - it was hard, heavy and way too sweet
just wanted to send a quick note to say that I was at Tavern on the Green last Friday, Feb
4th to celebrate my husband's birthday
We had an excellent time
I was very impressed with the restaurant manager on duty during our meal
She took time to welcome us and speak to us about the restaurant, as well as particular sites and locations to visit while in New York
She clearly demonstrated a professional yet caring attitude that seems so lacking in todays society
Tavern should be very happy to have such a person representing their establishment
My family was in New York City for 5 days over Christmas
We had dinner on Christmas day at T on the G
This was not only the worst meal we had during our entire trip, it may have been one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had!! Had reservation but had to wait to be seated - overcrowded rooms with tables crammed together -tacky decorations - RUDE waiter that finally gave us menus after we had been at our table over 15mins
- gratuity already added (only a party of 3) so waiter didn't give a d
n if we needed anything - food that tasted like it was being served at a cafateria!
The quality of food is not worth the price but the ambience and the chance to say I ate at Taven on the Green in Central Park is
I could have eaten food just as good for half the price somewhere else in Manhattan but just walking around the vast restaurant makes it worth a trip to Tavern on the Green once every few years
There are tons of tourists underdressed
The waiter messed up my order and we had to hunt down the wait staff to get a second drink
Just remember
it is about the ambience and NOT the food or the service
The decorations were over the top tacky
The lunch menu was overpriced
Salads and soups were mediocre at best
The place is nothing but a gaudy tourist trap
Stay away
Tavern on the Green should be ashamed at the way it presents itself to out-of-town visitors
The food and service aren't worth half of what the restaurant charges ($60 a meal)
When my family and I visited, we were hearded in and out of the restaurant like cattle; not once did our waiter ask how are meal was, and the waitress mixed up our steaks
Several of us ordered the filet mignon, and the texture was as dry as roast beef, and all were over cooked
I've had better steaks and service for a third of the price
Skip this establishment
the thing is Tavern on the Green is the msot beautiful restaurant in NYC over the holidays
The lights, the decorations- over the top! And since everyone knows that, it is overcrowded and dining is not enjoyable
I have been there in the spring summer and that is when i would not only say this is the most enchanting restaurant in NYC, but the menu selections are better and the atmosphere is wonderful too! Vist during April - November
Skip the holidays until you dont mind dining with 800 others
My boyfriend and I rang in the New Year at Tavern on the Green and it was the best experience I had ever had
The atmosphere, the service, and the food are all great
We found this to be a romantic and elgent way to enjoy the excitement of NYC during this time of year
We really enjoyed ourselves
We have decided to make this a New Year's tradition
I attended tavern on the green last new year with my wife and parents
I was visiting new york from the uk for the first time and tavern on the green was the highlight of our visit
people on stilts, ice sculptures, cosmopolitan fountain, fantastic buffet, amazing cocktails - great entertainment (get there early to esnure you have a table though as we had to share with a family
although they were all lovely and this added to our evening!)
Best view of fireworks in the city, and the fairy lights in the trees when you arrive just take your breath away
One word
Magical! 18 of us are going back next year
well done tavern on the green!!!
I can now say that I've experienced Tavern on the Green
Unfortunately, it was so lousy, there will be no return visit
Our party had just had two of the three main dishes ordered (filet and crab cakes) the night before at another restaurant cross-town
The meals here were so inferior it wasn't even funny
Service was impersonal and rushed
Items were being removed from our table before we were even finished
The only thing going for it is the atmosphere
After a co-workers suggestion, I went with a bunch of friends to dinner at Tavern on the Green
We were seated in th garden
The entire experience was amazing! We had the best time! There was a salsa night going on and we got up several times to dance in between courses
Loads of fun! The service was great - our waitress was attentive and friendly
The food was light and enjoyable
I will definately be back! I heard Sunday brunch was a fun event here too
I arranged for lunch at the Greenhouse with an out of town client expecting to be able to wow him with a wonderful New York experience
I expected the food to be at least fine and the service to be professional
I was really disappointed to find that the food was actually quite bad and that the service was impersonal and dismissive
The setting is nice, but there are many, many more atmospheric restaurants in New York that actually serve decent food by pleasant people
In the end, our client got a very New York experience indeed, albeit a terrible one
Dined in Greenhouse for brunch in a group of 6
Food was delicious (Egg Benedict is the best), stunning environment and decor
Staff are polite and helpful though they are indeed very busy
beautiful people, beautiful place, i think it's worth the money for the experience! Paking around on site $8 for 2 hours
Free balloon for b-day groups!
Despite what I had read on this website, my wife insisted we go to Tavern this past week while in NYC
She was right! Our food and service was excellent at lunch! The waiter gladly took a picture of us as well(they sell pictures, too
)
The only problem is $100 bucks for lunch and a couple of mixed drinks
Tavern on the Green may be a NY experience but it's cheesy, the food is not so great and the service is horrendous
When we went, the wait staff did not talk to us about any of the specials/the menu etc and handed us our bill while we were still eating
We weren't even there during a busy time, they just seemed eager to make us leave
It's worth trying if you're from out of town and want to see Central Park but for a good meal there are thousands of other places to go
Just want to say that I visited Tavern on the Green for the first time two weeks ago
I am from the city and i cant believe I have never been here before!   My friends I were so pleased!! I will definitely be back to NYC next time a nice day comes along
We sat in the Tavern Garden and had a lovely light lunch- seared sashimi Tuna delicious crab cakes
The serivce okay considering how busy it was this particular day
The atmosphere was great and I will certainly be back for a 2nd trip!
Recently went to Tavern
The atmosphere was great
Sat in the Crystal room and had a table near the window
The view was great even though it was raining
The dining room was a bit chilly
Food was okay
It sort of reminder me of cafeteria food, perhaps I was expecting the food to be outstanding and was very disappointed
When I got my food it was a bit cold and the creme brulee was terrible
Service was less than lackluster
We had to search down the man with the water when we needed a refill
The bread was great
I would go to Tavern on the Green just one time just to say I went there but I would not to mark a special occassion
I took a taxi there after a broadway show - got there about 1030PM

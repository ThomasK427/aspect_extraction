Like over at Totonos in Coney Island
I had the mushroom pizza and it was pretty good but not in the caliber of Lombardis or Grimaldis
Then we had the spinach raviolis which were awful
I've tasted better from the frozen food section
Besides the pizza, the menu is fairly ordinary and not worth the trip
With all the good places to eat in Manhattan, why bother with an average one? The space is nice, but the rest was average
I enjoyed my mushroom pizza, but the baked penne was bland
I had high hopes and was disappointed yet again
Pizza is bland and boring
Ours was not charred, but completely burnt on the bottom
The monkfish was literally inedible
I took one bite and pushed my plate away
Atmosphere was nothing special, but the service was good
The food is completely overpriced
This place is way overrated
They overload the pizza's with garlic! Not everyone loves garlic
It's even in the crust so there is no way to avoid it
Sent pizza back and tried to order something else but everything we chose was full of garlic according to waitress
Left unhappy and starving
It would probably be a great pizza if there was a no garlic option, but unfortunately they lost an otherwise potential repeat customer
Why can't some restaurants use garlic to enhance flavors instead of using it as the overpowering ingredient that it can be?
Started off with a nice white bean spread for the lovely bread
Roasted asparagus with pancetta, Parmesan, olive oil and a fried egg on top is as good as it sounds
Corn tomato salad also ranks right up there in the great appetizer category
The pizza with wild mushrooms
just plain excellent
Veal rigatoni was nice, though I'll try something else next time
Wine list good
Service was professional
Very good experience overall
Alcohol excluded, prices are quite reasonable considering the quality
I would have rated this much higher
Don't know why it was only #10 - I've been to a few of the others that wound up higher on the list, and I have to say that I totally disagree with those choices
Pizza was great, the $11 Ketel One martini was a ripoff
I heard the chef/owner was friendly and stopped to tell him the pizza was excellent and got a look like, who the hell do you think you are to even address me without an appointment
So, I try to make a reservation for 5 people
They state, we need a credit card to hold such a reservation, I state: what are you going to charge?
They respond: $10 per person if you do not cancel by 12pm the day of the reservation
Result=I make a reservation elsewhere! Food's good but not the attitude!
ONE THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THE GREAT PIZZA, THE ATMOSPHERE IS ALSO QUITE NICE, KINDA LOUD, BUT STILL VERY NICE
I've been a big Lombardi's booster for years, but this wins hands down, especially the spicy eggplant, with the prociutto (sp?) and arugala not far behind
Amazingly thin crust, which gets a bit soggy if you take it home, but one person can easily finish a whole pie
I haven't tried too much of the other items, but the basic mesclune salad had a nicelight dressing and the pureed bean app was really really tasty, if bland looking
And I agree with a couple of reviews down that the asparagus and egg app is very very good, but not light on calories -- also huge and low-ish on carbs, so you Atkiners could eat that for an entree
Wine prices are good too, nice list, service is fine, not top-notch, but friendly and trying both times I've been
Definitely recommended
Gonzo is a nice restaurant in a nice brownstone, but it is nothing amazing
I do have to say that the pizza is great and I would go back just for that, but that's all
The main dishes are nothing special
Our waiter brought out three main courses, but the fourth wasn't ready so we had to wait for 10 minutes for the last dish to arrive, but they were very nice and gave us free red pepper hummus while we waited
The scene is nice and decor is nice, but the food was lacking
I say try it for yourself and definitely get the pizza b/c it is amazing
Pizza is good
however, the other food (had pasta with eggplant that was bitter and burned garlic
halibut in porcini with pesto was poor - pesto and porcini killed the fish
Service was horrible, unless you were ordering a really expensive bottle of wine, then they paid attention
Many rules, overheard the waiter many times telling patrons no substitutions, must order all courses at once etc
Shame because my first visit was pleasant
The pizzas are really good, but look beyond them and you have a fantastic selection
I started with the asparagus and egg appetizer then moved on to the stuffed quail with zucchini and broccoli rabe
Every bite was delicious
I went with no reservation and sat in the front I spoke with the hostess while sitting at the bar and she suggested sitting up front - more spartan but no reservation needed
The entire staff was highly professional
The food was mediocre at best
They have tried to reinvent the pizza, but why bother? Why not just make a great pizza? They don't use mozzarella and while the thin crust is a nice touch, it's drenched in oil
If you're looking for great pizza, go to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn
If you're looking for great thin crust pizza, go to Gruppo in the East Village
Whatever you do, don't go to Gonzo
Great pizza!!! I always love going here for a salad and pizza - super thing crust and good flavors/toppings
Have not really ventured into other items on the menu since I enjoy the pizza so much
Bar is a good spot if there is no room in the dining room
entrees leave alot to be desired, but what really makes this place shine is the assortment of pizzas as well as the dessert
the praline sandwich is a MUST!
The pizza is exceptional
The rest of the menu is pretty tasty, too
The space is attractive, the crowd is very downtown
There's enough room at the table to stretch out in your seat
The owner always greets you and gets your feedback at some point during the meal
I liked that a lot
Not for the dieters
Or for the hard of hearing
IT'S NOISY
I discovered Gonzo right when it opened
Almost every single item on the very diversified menu is fantastic, be it the little appetizers (the sandwich spreads are amazing!), the larger appetizers, the yummy entrees or, of course, the PIZZA
From heaven!! The prices are very great too and that leads us to the major caveat: It has become nearly impossible to get a seat (even in the bar area)
The old New York rule unfortunately also applies here: If a restaurant serves truly great food to affordable prices you will not be getting a seat (unless you are willing to dine at 5pm)
Yesterday, we tried it on a Sunday night, but even then they told us that there will be at least a wait of an hour
Great pizzas with inventive toppings kept simple
They also have great bread spreads like chick peas (watch out for the garlic) and eggplant
Good wine list and attentive service make this place a great place for a light bite or a hearty meal
It is really loud though and crowded so don't expect to drop in without a reservation and eat anytime soon
Also the lighting in the bar could be dimmed a few notches to give the otherwise boring space a little atmosphere
The dining room is much cozier
The staff couldn't be more attentive and accommodating
My companion was late and they kept checking on me to make sure I was comfortable while waiting
Allowing me to use the phone
Food especially the pizza was very good
Wines are plentiful and prices varied
My only regreat is that the place was so noisy you could not have a conversation
although our group was seated promptly according to our reservation, that was the only impressive thing about this restaurant

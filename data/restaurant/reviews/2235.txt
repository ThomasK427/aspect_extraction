No Botanica at Botanica! (I thought that there would be plants)
The food also came cold and they they charge $13 for drinks
Best sunday brunch in the city, Best buffet assortment, love the enourmous pastry buffet
Nirvana is over-priced for the worst Indian food I have ever had
Moreover, the service is horrible
The servers are very unhospitable and they are very slow in obtaining and bringing your order
The view is beautiful but definitely NOT worth it
I will never come here again! If you want to have an enjoyable night, do NOT go to Nirvana
Or go only expecting bad food, horrible service, and long waiting
New Years Eve 1998, my family and friends loved the service and decor
Great food and what an awesome view of the Park
One of the most romantic spots in all of NYC
The decor is so tacky that it's fun
The food is not spectacular, but solid indian, especially in the more traditional dishes
First is the obnoxious doorman dressed up in a cheap genie outfit
Then there are the servers that resent the guests and make it quite clear
You actually feel that you are in a hostile environment when dining here
I cannot believe this place is in business with such animosity towards patrons
I have had snacks from Shaheen (Indian fast food) that was better than this food
Nirvana is an insult to anyone that knows great indian food
They cannot even do the basics like Vindaloo right and the waiters are condesending
Amazing views of NYC regaled us at lunch earlier in the week and then at dinner this evening
Great service and food made the setting even more wonderful and awe inspiring
The Tandoori and Breads are the best any restaurant can offer
The Samosas delectable and subtle
The chef beautiful and talented
Great lunch with sterling city views
Excellent and prompt service
Easy to get to in midtown
The food, atomospher, and service were excellent
They provide a basket of assorted breads with your meal, but the bread could have been the meal, it was so delicious
They have a wide variety of food's to choose from and the prices are reasonable, for New York
Arriba Arriba is by far the most fun mexican restaurant in NYC
The ambiance is fantastic - super loud with dance music usually, so not the best date place
Go with a group of friends! The service is great, the food is great
and the margaritas
WOW
The best part
Order a Mama margarita
They are delciously refreshing, and absurdly strong
Order a 2nd and you may not be able to stand up straight by the end of your meal - my kind of drink!
just i wanna say something about margaritas:excellent
i was drunk because i was stop over there for my friend and then i was try the MARGARITA ON THE ROCK WITH SALT and i was close the restaurant,and the food is very good also
yummy
food was great - shredded chicken burrito, mama's burrito (vegetarian)
salsa is amazing here, the chips could use more salt
service is very very quick
margertias were good and spiked
price is very reasonable
don't think this place is romantic, it is very loud, it is hard to hear people speaking
very cramped
great music
I've been going to Arriba-Arriba for years and can't get enough of it
The food is wonderful
The staff are friendly
The drinks are amazing! Being a vegetarian, some Mexican places don't have much of a selection for me, but I never get tired of trying the varieties they offer here
The tortilla chips they put on your table arrrive warm and the salsa can't seem to get in my husbands mouth fast enough
The guacamole is made by hand and I can't bear to leave even a morsel of it behind
The bean burritos and the cheese enchiladas are to die for and don't get me started on their refried beans
I can't believe the lackluster reviews here, I've never had a bad experience at Arriba
I've been going to this restuarant for years--the margaritas are fantastic, and the food is delicious
Coming from Oklahoma, I never thought I'd find good Mexican or BBQ in the city
Thankfully, there's Arriba for Mexcian (though I'm still looking for BBQ, and Virgil's just doesn't cut it)
The waiters are always terrific, and the DJ plays good music
Sometimes it feels more like a gay club than a Mexican restaurant (though they really should bring back the disco ball)
Ignore the nay-sayers, try this place, it's a winner!
My husband and I recently moved to new york from Atlanta Ga
We love good mexican food and that is what arriba arriba delivered
The service however, left a little to be desired
I ordered a large margarita and it was terrible; the worst well tequila I have ever tasted
I told the waiter that my drink tasted very bad and asked if he could swap it out for a Petron Margarita
The waiter returned and said the bartender refused to take my drink back because there was nothing wrong with it and I would have to pay for it
I asked to speak to the manager who told me the same thing
They were so unwilling to compromise it was absurd
I told the manager to pour my drink down the drain, cancel my food orders and give me the check
I have spent about $800 at this place over the last 6 months and will NEVER go back; literally the WORST dining experience I have ever had in NYC
This place is soooo yummy for mexican- all of the stuff on your plate has distinctive flavors and the drinks keep coming! The only con is that the place is always so full and the tables are tight- so you have to inhale for people to pass- but the tequilla is so good that you forget about all that and enjoy your food- good service- and the energy of all of the happy people around you in a great area of the city- all of the great things you would look for in Chelsea- without having to impress anybody!
Used to LOVE this place, especially their frozen margaritas and wonderful wait staff
But the hosts
oh, the hosts
Rude, unaccommodating and dumb as stones
Despite being a regular - sometimes 2-3x a week - the host has refused to seat me (1) full party was not there (even though we offered to pay for a 3rd entree if the person didn't show up) or (2) no 2-seaters were available, yet 8 4-seats sat empty
I'll miss the joint, even if they won't miss my business
if yoiu want to take your grandfather who has colitis and ulcers to a mexican restaurant, this should be your choice! the food is so bland and spiceless, he won't be able to distinguish it from the tapioca pudding at the nursing home
the salsa tastes like campbell's tomato soup
i asked for a side of diablo hot sauce
it was about as hot as gazpacho, and they had the nerve to charge $2 for 2 tablespoons of it! it was worse thsn taco bell
Knowing Arriba Arriba is in my neighborhood makes me a happy woman
I love the burritos (I get them every time -can't help myself), the chicken w/spinach special is fantastic, just to name a few of the many spectacular options on their menu
With the awesome chips salsa constantly replenished, attentive wait staff (always keeps the water glass full, except not quite as attentive on weekend nights with the jam packed atmosphere)
Food almost always served with great speed and the frozen margaritas are heavenly (my favorite is the strawberry)
Down side is it can be loud with people and/or music so if you are in the mood for quiet time, intimate conversation I would have to pass unless you go early in the evening
I've been coming here for years and watched the atmosphere sink, sink, sink
Tables moved closer, volume louder, service more impersonal
After being rudely told that every one would have to be present to be seated we waited ( a big five minutes) for the rest of our small group
We're sooo busy (there were three visible tables empty)  Nine dollar food minimum
(the one person who wasn't eating easily would have had 40 dollars of Margaritas)
This place is becoming so gay-centric that it seems to be deliberately alienating everyone else
They need to realize they are not that good
If another good Mexican rest

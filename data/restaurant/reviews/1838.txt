My California-raised, worked-in-Spain friend had the eggs rancheros which she said were the best she'd ever had
The service was a little spotty, but the restaurant was packed by noon
It's a pretty good deal for the price
I have yet to have a poor experience here
The lamb chops as my server, Theresa, stated are possibly the best in the city
As a person whom is married to a man whom always gets the same thing and will never waver I was impressed to see that our server was able to convince both my husband and myself to try something new last week
She greeted us by name and remebered what our favorites were and then made brillant recommendations by decribing every detail of our dishes (shrimp followed by veal chop)
Bravo to this well trained staff
Our bussboys were promt and the hostess gracious
Always a treat
I recommend: Theresa as your server (a sweet Puerto Rican girl with the most amazing smile)
The shrimp starter, the lamb or veal chop as a main
Outstanding!! We love Five Points, have been there many, many times never ceases to amaze us
The food is always innovative, fresh and delicious, staff is super warm, welcoming and friendly, this place is off the charts
We're so lucky to have them in the neighborhood!
Based on the rave reviews on citysearch I made brunch reservations for a large group
At first i was very impressed with the ambience/decor and the little stream running through the restaurant
BUT, we waited over an hour and a half for our food -- how long does it take to make eggs?? The waitress and the manager were both completely rude, unresponsive and unapologetic when we repeatedly asked where our food was
It was an absurd wait for such simple brunch food
The restaurant had potential, it's too bad the service was atrocious
Excellent food, service and ambiance
We've been coming here for a while and have never had an unsatisfactory experience
The truffle pizza is out of sight!
On top of excellent food and an extremely relaxing decor
They consistently have the type of service that you enjoy tipping for
Keep it up!
Place very nice as you walk in
Great ambience
Food was so so unfortunately
Ordered tuna and it was way over-cooked
Rare turned out to be almost well done
Food afterall is what's it all about
no matter how nice a place is
I hadn't been to Five points in a while and was so pleased to have had the best meal there ever
They keep doing it right! The potato pizza w/truffle oil appetizer is not to be missed
The asparagus w/olive ricotta was a mouthful of layered sensations
And the Sticky Toffee pudding still ranks as one of the best desserts I've ever had
I also ate some of my son's Malted Ice Cream with hot fudge
outstanding
Although I would not say this is a family restaurant, they handled our children beautifully
Can't wait to try! Service was great, as was the entire ambiane, including the music, lighting, decor, etc
I look forward to going back soon
And I just found out they are open for lunch
Can't wait to try it
I have been to five points many, many times
What I love about them is how they take care of their customers-if someone is drunk and rowdy at the bar, they will take care of the problem
I love the fact that there is a cool, New York theatre going crowd there at 6:00 at night
The food is beyond amazing, the atmosphere is beyond cool, all my friends love it
Try one of the many great martini's (summertini is my fav)
The Sunday brunch is the best in New York (ricotta fritters will make you drool)
No matter what don't leave without having the potato teleme pizzette-one of the best things I have ever had in my life
By the way I am in my 20's and work in fashion, so I know what is cool and what is not- this place is the best
We loved Five Points- great atmosphere, great service, and really terrific food
Inventive takes on traditional foods
I recommend the mac and cheese, the huevos rancheros, and the chocolate french toast
Save room for the choclate bread pudding
You'll have to go back bed when you get home, but it's worth it
Five Points is a true gem among NYC restaurants
They win on so many fronts
The kitchen wins with top quality ingredients, straightforward preparations, and a rotating cast of menu items and specials
The front of the house offers winning service and a beautiful, serene setting
The bar wins with delicious concoctions, and a knockout happy hour
Especially notable is their consistency -- nary a misfire after probably 25 visits over the past few years
Note to groups -- they do a wonderful job with larger parties
the space in front of the kitchen is lovely and they often don't require a set/ limited menu
I recently took a group of 12 very discerning colleagues for dinner, and there were rave reviews all around
Everyone is touting the fabulous brunch, but what about Happy Hour
If you like oysters, this is the place from 5-7 pm weekdays
the have $1 Blue Point Oysters (limit 12) and $5 martinis (limit 2)
The service is FANTASTIC, everyone is so friendly
And every time I go in for the oysters I just have to order the braised short rib too, it is THAT good
If you haven't tried it you, you must SOON!
We had a special birthday dinner last night and couldn't have been more pleased, from the minute we came in to the minute we left - and we didn't want to go!
Friendly, accommodating front desk work, the best server (Theresa) in the city, and some of the most incredible food we've had
Great pasta, better salads, and duck, quail , and chicken cooked to perfection
They even made special vegetables for me, because I didn't eat brussel sprouts (does anyone)? Save room
Desserts are incredible
Sticky toffee cake with vanila whipped cream? Yes please
And another one
And another one
And another one
I have a few places left to try, but so far Five Points is my clear winner for best brunch in the city
The bloody mary was excellent, (try the mexican bloody mary if you'd like an extra bite from the tequila, mmm), the mexican pastry with hot chocolate make a nice starter, and the wood oven eggs with tomato were delicious
Everyone at our table was happy with their dish
The place is beautiful and service was friendly
(p
s
we had the table right next to the kitchen that another reader complained about, but it's fine if you're not so uptight, relax, it's brunch!) It's a little pricey for brunch, after all it's not a diner, but well worth it
I have been here several times, by myself, with my girlfriend, with my family, with hers, regardless the staff picks up what needs to be done and takes care of business
At first the service seems syrupy, but eventually you realize that the staff actually DOES care!!! Coat check, hostess, busboy, everyone takes a moment to help you to feel taken care of, and the food is always perfect
They don't need to, I can tell, but this place is small, good, and always impressive
Thank you so many times, it's about time I wrote something
This place has a great Sunday brunch
The eggs and fish are yummy, the chocolate bread pudding is scrumptious, and the drinks in pitchers are a nice touch
This one one of the best Sunday brunch trend places I have been to and I have been to many
A little loud but the food and servive were at the top of the class
A place to try
This restaurant is such a great find
The space is beautiful, the food is incredible and the service is friendly and noteworthy
They have great watermellon martinis and the best chocolate bread pudding in the world!

Arrived here on a cold, rainy, gray, blustery Memorial Day for lunch
Greeted warmly, shown to my table in the Crystal Room by friendly staff
Wait captain answered questions, made recommendations took my order
The lobster bisque was wonderful, the crabcakes very good, the creme brulee disappointing
The portions were adequate the service overall was attentive, not intrusive
The main attractions are the decor and the location, which are both fabulous! Probably would not go back, but so glad I've been
For what I wanted on a miserable rainy day, my last in Manhattan, it was perfect
These comments sum-up our Wedding Anniversary Brunch last weekend
It's not our first time there but will be our last:  Slow service
surrounded by un-cleared dirty tables
sharing food with pigeons squirrels
$4 cold coffee
overpriced (very average)food
extremely disorganized
disinterested waiter
I don't know why everyone thinks this place is overrated
We were treated very nicely, and we got a table practically smack in the middle of the Crystal Room which was more than I could have asked for! The singing waitstaff was great, and so was the special chocolate cake we ordered
Good portions, decent prices, especially for the atmosphere
Try the stuffed avocado with shrimp salad
Oh, and the prime rib was huge! I could barely finish my plate
I would definitely come here again
While visiting NY my daughter surprised me with dinner
I had never been to Central Park, and I was excited
Just walking up to the door was such a thrill seeing the horses and carriages lined up waiting to take a stroll through the park
Thats where the thrill ends
The menu had a very limited selection of actual good food to eat
The small bowl of soup that I had cost $11
00, and I figured, hey it's Lobster Bisque, and lobster is expensive, so it is probably filled with it
NOT! Not any lobster in it
Even the way it was presented, the waiter poured it into a bowl from a pitcher that looked like a creamer that you would find in an old coffee shop
The decor made me feel like I was eating in a house of ill repute, not that I've ever been in one
The service was the crappiest service I've ever received at a high class restaurant
When I went, we ordered the prix fixe menu which is a reasonable price
Unfortunately, the waiters were the RUDEST people I've ever met
Also, the restaurant is starting to look a little shabby
It may have looked good in its prime, but not anymore
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE
Worst Thanksgiving dining out experience ever! Booked the Crystal Room months in advance only to find our reservation lost
Almost got put in a back room, but complained and got the worst table in the Crystal Room instead! Way overpriced too
Better to have looked in the window at the decor, then had turkey sandwiches at a deli
My spouse is still recovering healing emotionally from the credit card charge
Have been there several times and always thought the place was unfairly treated
However, this time (Feb 9) our party of 10 was place as far away from light and windows as possible
Appetizers arrived 20 minutes after the order, entrees about 90 minutes later---stone cold
Outrageous! 20% tip built in the charge so there was no incentive for service
Salads looked like they came in by grocery truck and were stacked on the plates
Other offerings without distinction
Stay away!!!
Nice decor
a lot of different room and right in the heart of Central Park
Thats the greatest thing about this restaurant
If you just want to find a restaurant with a nice view, then this is the right restaurant
If you want good food, then you r in the wrong one
The food taste like a diner trying to make sophisticated food
BTW, very pricey for a diner type of food
Tavern on the Green was a large disappointment
Although legendary back in the day when Warner Le Roy was at the helm it was a NYC institution
But the reviewers here are right
First and foremost everything was dirty from the silverware, glassware and flatware to our waiters stained uniform
I was so disappointed with my meal, it was cold, tastless and I am not known for my kitchen skills but I KNOW I could do better
The location is the ONLY saving grace
Believe what is written here, I have had better food at a golf course concession stand
Service rude unattentive
Unless you have a desire to be another victim
save your money, your time and your palette
Don't waste your time or money on this place
There are many other places in NYC to get wonderful food without spending this much money
The place was loud, crowded, middle of the road food and service
I felt that I was in a herd of cattle
One of the worst dining experiences that I have ever had
After all the great things I've heard about it, I was severely disappointed
Everyone's food was bland (5 people), and nothing really special made it stand apart
And the price we paid for it was ridiculous
I don't mind shelling out a few bucks for great food, but the meals were something that each of us could have made better
But if money means nothing to you, and you like touristy things, then this is the place for you
The decor is very fairy tale-like but a bit on the cheesy side
This place is definitely all hype
I suggest skipping this one if you not superficial and appreciate real food
We have never opted to eat at Tavern on the Green, until now, because it has always seemed very tourist-like to us
Recently the Winter Resteraunt Week 2003 opened our minds to eating to eating there
At the time I thought I was lucky to make reservations during Winter Restaurant Week, however, in hindsight I see that it wasn't luck but maybe the poor service and quality of food that left them with availability
Unfortunately, disappointment is not the right word for what my husband and I felt after dining that evening
The waitstaff was slow and extremely unattentive, dinner was lsub-par and the feeling of being led like cattle into an overcrowded dining room was less than expected from a restaurant with a reputation of excellence
Everything from food to service left a very bad taste in our mouths
It is indeed set up like a fairy tale house in the middle of a garden
Walk through the mirrored hallway leading to the seating area felt like walking through a fun house
The manicotti was delicious
Chocolate cake for dessert was a decent portion but a bit dry
I can honestly say that TOTG is one of the worst restaurants in Manhattan
I took my girlfriend there thinking that it was this great romantic place
The food reminded me of a cheap wedding hall
I would think that a $39 piece of steak would be at the very least edible
It was not!! I've had better food at Mc Donalds
The atmosphere was ok but the place actually looks and feels like a wedding hall inside
The courtyard was nice
The deserts looked as if they were purchased in bulk at Cosco
Terrible
This restaurant is the biggest rip off in the city, and should be reserved for tourists only!!!
Having read all of the extremely negative reviews of this place, I was a bit apprehensive when I received a gift certificate for a meal here
While I don't doubt that all of these people had bad experiences, ours was certainly the opposite

The waitstaff and ownership is so laid back and cool - they accommodate your every need
A fun place to sit outside and people watch!
As Newsday has reported awhile back, they do have the best falafel on Steinway Street, and the other items are also fresh and delicious, the fresh lemonade is an authentic treat too
I've lived in the Middle East and I know what I am talking about
This is a family-owned ethnic establishment of the type that used to be common in NYC before commercial rents drove most of them out, so reviewers expecting trendy Manhattan-style decor or Olive Garden style 'corporate' service should stay away
I suspect one of the prior reviewers here never considered the possibility that the waitress was not talkative because she doesn't speak English! That said, if you appreciate Lebanese food and small family businesses, by all means try El Rawsheh
The food was decent and reasonably priced, but the service was terrible! We were seated at a dirty table with the previous customer's leftovers
They removed the items and didn't bother to wipe the table clean
We ended up having to clean the tables ourselves
The menus were sticky and dirty
We had to pay extra for the water! The waitress never opened her mouth, not even to say thank you or you're welcome
The ambience is definitely not romantic because we saw laundry hung on the neighbor's clothing line a few feet away from where we were sitting
The food was average, nothing spectacular
We will definitely not be back!
I was walking around the neighborhood when the fascinating smells called me in
I ordered (albeit butchered the pronounciation of) the Kafta Mechwi
It was fabulous, esp
combined with Babaghanouj and Pita
Don't let the atmosphere scare you, it's good food
this place is amazingly bad
The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan
Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold
i dont how this place is still running
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area
And despite Gabriella's claim that she uses only the finest ingredients; the Grand Dame has been seen purchasing cases of Kraft string cheeze at Cosco
As for the bar, this is another bad idea
The seating is cramped; the drinks exceptionally pricey and watered down, and there is only ONE unisex bathroom (YUCK!!!)
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere)
I love this cozy around the way Rest
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat
A one women show! despite the untasteful previous review
It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine
The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's
Gotta love it
! I am having my husband's birthday party there
SO GET READY FOR THE LOUDNESS!!!! BORING NEIGHBORS!
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer
I for one will never patronize them again
Great menu, great layout, AMAZING patio, always fast service
even if some of the waitstaff can get a little gruff
Taste-Delite Ice Cream! Woo hoo!
Love it! Being a vegetarian, from their fresh-fruit shakes, salads and sandwiches there are tons of great choices which make it stand apart from a traditional Queens diner
In the nice weather, their backyard seating and a Last Mango in Paris shake can't be beat
Upon first look, I would've never assumed this place was a ice cream cafe by any means
They have decent priced diner food and a good assortment of health shakes they use natural fruit for
I have in fact, never even tried the ice cream for as long as I've been here
Its a shame they are not 24 hours, or I'd come more often
They have free delivery and a minimum $10 charge for use of a credit card
The service is hit or miss, the location is great, the interior seems to have a home feel more than most other diners, and the prices are very affordable
Recommended to those who want to try a different setting for a diner
Compared to the other options in the area, this place is consistantly good
The menu is huge and the cost is very reasonable
Friendly, accomodating staff
Side usually come with meal even when not noted on the menu, so you may want to ask what they have since there are many choices
I have been going to Igloo since it opened in the Summer of 2001
I love the food and the service and people who work there are great
Everything is fresh and taste incredible
I highly recommend this place
This is your Astoria spot for a Sunday breakfast
Superb smoothies!! Love their paninis and wraps
The service is great and it has a patio
I can always rely on Igloo for great food
This cute place comes with an outdoor option with an ambience that is quite serne
it feels like I'm having a picnic! The staff is pleasant
The food is DELICIOUS
Make sure to try the breakfast wrap with waffle fries
YUM!
GREAT food, really cool staff, very close to major transportation (N, W, R, G, V)
Sunswick has great atmosphere and a varied crowd
it's right across from Kaufman Astoria movie/tv studios and right in the middle of a young and ethnically diverse neighborhood
There's a cool jukebox, but they've got a live dj on Wednesday nights that plays an amazing mix of music
One of my favorite places to go!
Most people don't know anything about Sunswick; in fact, they have never even heard of the joint
But it's such a cute and pleasant bar/restaurant
The food is always so surprisingly darn good and the service is always great and they have a very well-rounded selection of beer
It's a hidden gem among all the tacky and pretentious Greek bars/lounges in Astoria
Check it out!
Perfect rice, yummy kabobs, beautiful arabi music all lend themselves to a wonderful eating experience at Black Iris
Dont expect fine dining, it's casual, but with great food
If the middle eastern soft drinks are available, be sure to have one and dont skip the pastries
A+
I practically live at this place
Must be something in the homemade pita bread that keeps me going back for more! I love the lentil soup, falafel and especially the vegetable pita pizza, with spinach in place of the peppers
The service is very friendly and the prices cannot be beat
I've been there several times and the food and service have been excelent
They serve till late so when you're hitting the bars at night you can still get some great food to finish it off
If it's not to hot sit outside on third ave
Just went there for the first time about a week ago and the food was absolutely delicious
No problem with the service either
I can't wait to go back and also want to try the brunch
I have been to Cebu on numerous occasions and was satisfied with the food as well as the service
Friends and I made a reservation on a Saturday night for 8PM, we were seated at around 8:20 which was not a problem
The problem was the service
it took about a half hour for the appetizer to arrive then once our table was cleared, it took over an HOUR for our main entrees
When we told our server what the problem was, he said it's not my fault! You could have at least come to our table and checked up on our party
The back room is small, he had to have noticed we were sitting there for over an hour
The food was ok when it arrived, my salmon over overdone

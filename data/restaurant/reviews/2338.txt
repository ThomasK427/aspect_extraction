Next time I want Italian food, I will go to Little Italy
I expected high prices at Nello, but as I looked at the menu my eyes became as large as the Birkin Mary-Kate has been seen toting around these days--$18 for soup, $22 for a plate of mixed greens, $40 for pasta
You have to be kidding me
My friend and I were seated at a table that may have well been in the 'waiting area', and the genius maitre'd decided to keep the front door open even though it was 40 degrees outside
To top it all off, a woman came into the resaturant pushing a pink stroller--carring two dogs none the less, which the staff promptly made room for at her table
Give me a break! I can get a hell of a lot of soup and salad at Whole Foods for $40
I could almost hear the cash register in the staff's heads going Ca-Ching! Ca-Ching! Ca-Ching!
Having travelled extensively over the past year from Europe to NYC to do business and -- to some extent -- shopping, Nello's soon proved to the place to deliver what I came for in the upper east area
Excellent lunch arrangements, wine card and superior service
I am going to NYC again late January, 2006 but I already made reservations for my wife and I
We are looking forward to having George welcoming us again
I was really looking forward to a nice long lunch at Nello's
My friend and I arrived knowing the steep prices, but thought, why not? It was a rainy day worthy of a leisurely lunch
Well, I was absolutely shocked when the waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks on me, my nice sweater and very expensive bag
Obviously people make mistakes, but I never received even an I'm sorry from the waitress
Surely, a manager would apologize? Offer us a drink? Offer to pay to have my items cleaned? Nothing
Perhaps some people enjoy spending $100 on lunch as the server looks for a better table to serve, but not me
Unfortunately for Nello, I actually am taking the time to write this and sharing the experience with all friends and family
I do not think these people who are writing negative reviews about Nellos know the value of a doller
in one of the most expensive addresses in the world,ithink Nellos prices were pretty reasonable and good
I was there dining after my conferance about 4pm 4/12/05
my reservation were for 5
I was alow to seat anywhere the maitre`d was like my very own assistant who provide me with the best accomadations
I ordered the sea bass and 2 glasses of wine and dessert my bill was only little bit over 96 dollers for a first class resaturant like nello`s
You have to live a little or eat cake
seated close to the door the waiters left us in no doubt that we were second class citizens, showing us little attention and telling a regular that they would NEVER give her such a terrible table
Food good but over priced, service shocking
No good going to Nello's unless money doesn't matter
Make sure you go with a millionaire as host
Lunch for three can be $650 of even $1250 if you have truffles
Anyone who complains of poor service is not understanding that this place is jammed with customers at peak hours
The attitude is assiduous even if the crowds prevent the promise being fulfilled
Here the otherwise passe era of jetset society can be experienced with a relish
When you order Dover sole you get Dover sole of a magical quality that you can rely on, the real thing
You pay to be absolutely sure that the food is the best available
Matching their pasta anywhere else would be hard even in Italy
Here quality is no illusion even if the prices are fantastical
This has been my worst dining experience in the city
The quality of the food was good, but extraordinarily overpriced at that quality
Service was also poor
it took forever for the waiter to take my order as he was too busy chatting at the bar
I ordered a lobster salad appetizer from the list of specials and it was $40!!! There was nothing special about it!   You are much better off spending your money at the other more famous italian restaurants in the city (e
g
, Il Mulino)
I remember fondly eating at nellos for lunch a few years ago, with a nice location and an excellant staff this use to be an expensive but wonderful option
I returned recently and found a lot had changed
The service was simply horrible, especially for a restaurant half full, with seemingly more waiters then patrons at the time
The table next to mine was offered dessert before even ordering their main course
The food was lackluster and the person taking the order was unwilling to fullfill a special request which they had succesfully accomplished at my last lunch
Overall a bad experience, stay away unless someone else is paying and you have no where else to go
Went to Nell's for dinner
Though it was very good, I've had better pasta for much less
Ravioli will run you about $40
Nothing impressive, but nothing unimpresive either
The Kir Royale was made of a green sparkling wine, on asking the server about the wines by glass, he did not know where the Pinot Noir was from, but he offered me a taste and told me it was $18 a glass ( is this a 4 star place - not!!), $21 for a measly Carpaccio and $32 for a plate of Gnocchi!! Yes we sat through this daylight robbery and warn you beware of Nello, or be robbed
This is the most ridiculous pricing i have ever seen in my entire life
Lunch entrees ranged from $31-$48 and my beer was $12
A three course lunch with a couple drinks for 2 could easily cost $250
Nello has superb Northern Italian food
While the prices are high, you pay for a beautiful restaurant on Madison Avenue, great people-watching and food that never disappoints
The angel hair pasta is the best in the city; the osso buco perfect; the vitello tonnato sublime
The bellinis are fantastic too
What's this about poor service? We've always been treated well there; the waiters are polite and attentive
Anyone who says this a bad restaurant is a penny-pincher
Let them eat cake
The food was ok, but over $100 per person before drinks!!! Are they nuts! I could get better food with as much ambience at any Italian below 14th St
What is their problem
The indiffernet staff just makes the overpriced menu and mediocre food seem even worse
Some interesting patrons to feast your eyes on, but you can get that in good restaurants too
Nello serves very good food
Unfortunately, the $30 plate of angel hair with marinara the one reviewer just complained about cost $12
95 in 1996
There's no way to justify the current prices, even though the food is really good
The crowd used to be local and elegant
The last time I was there it seemed to be filled with bond traders and the strippers they date
Nello is a nice guy, I've often wondered what happened here
This place is expensive
Now, I do not mind paying up for a culinary delight, but a $30 plate of pasta has to provide a little more than angel hair with marinara
And the atmosphere is sickening-I do love to people watch, but here everyone eyes you down due to your last season Chanel
Don't bother, it's just about the worst place I've ever dined at
We went to Nino's for Valentines day dinner
There was a fixed menu
The options were scarce, and there were no italian options to speak of
The scallops in my appetizer were in fact not scallops but skate, the linguini was like cardboard
My chicken was overcooked, dry and flavorless and my tiramasu was stale
We wound up spending over 200 for a bad meal
I would never go back
Overpriced commercial italian food
When the phrase the water is free is etched into your water glass - you know there will be nothing authentic about your meal
The food is fresh, but not impressive and the waiters try way to hard to fake italian accents
Although we left a generous tip (above double the tax) the waiter made a scene as we were leaving the restaurant, forcing to leave more
The restaurant is conducive to conversation, but you won't be talking about the food since its just regular and there are many more places in the City for better italian at a fraction of the cost
I recently had a 50th Wedding Anniversary Party for my parents at Nino's
The restaurant was very accomodating with a specially designed menu and even made the desert cake
All the extras at the end of the meal were overwhelming
The abundance of food, wine, and service were first rate and I couldn't thank Nino himself and his staff for making it a memorable evening!!!
I have ate here on multiple occasions and its always very warm, and the service is very prompt
The mussels in marinara are a must, and the caesar salad is also very good
if you have any money left over try the bananna desert
We went during restaurant week for lunch and I was disappointed

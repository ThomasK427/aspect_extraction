The dishes are inventive and meticulously presented
Appetizers/entrees came sizzling hot, an achievement in this large space
Critics have noted the small dishes and price, but those accustomed to fine dining will find their value in the food
Megu cuts through the clutter of the NYC restaurant scene with functional presentations that really add to the flavor
Example: a simple snapper salad tossed and seared at the table allows access to a dish that only works when tasted immediately
Table side preparation adds another layer - Aroma
Most restaurants have their 'house smell'
Megu's air-born scents shift throughout the night with whatever is being prepared at/near your table
Sushi aficionados must sample Megus fresh fish, especially the various types of Tuna; perfectly proportioned, with quality hard to find elsewhere
I went to Megu for dinner recently with a group of friends, and let me tell you, we had a fantastic time! The kobe beef steak on the stone was delicious melting in our mouths
And the sushi we had, especially the different cuts of tuna, out of this world! We realized that this place actually has the freshest seafood and meat, best of both worlds
There was enough variety on the menu that we all enjoyed different dishes
And one more thing
The restrooms had this really nice touch, with crickets singing! I personally felt as if I had took a very special journey out of New York which I have never felt in any other restaurant before
As much as I heard about the high prices, it was actually an average New York price
Can't wait to go back again
A friend dragged me along--I wasn't sure I'd like it since I thought it was just a place to see be seen, with a big price tag attached
But his father was paying, so
It was definitely scene-y, but the service was suprisingly pretty good for a place so busy (I used to be a waiter
Our waitress was slammed, but gave us attention when we needed it we never wanted for much
) Anyway, despite the loud music having to deal with my friend oogling Lindsay Lohan I loved the wine list
Someone there knows what they're doing
And the Kobe Beef steak flambeed tableside was worth it, too
I'd go back early on a weeknight save room for more uni--it was some of the best uni I've had outside of Santa Barbara
I dined at Megu the other night with some of my friends that were visiting from Japan and we had the most incredible sushi
We ate at the bar and the chefs were very accomodating and prepared perfect sushi for us
I especially liked the Japanese snapper and the uni
They even prepared for us a special yellowtail dish that was outstanding
We also enjoyed Kobe beef and an amazing shrimp roll as well
I had heard that the restaurant was more of a scene than a dining experience, but it is definitely authentic
We even saw Giorgio Armani while we were dining as well
GO TO THE SUSHI BAR AT MEGU!!!
The prices of this restaurant are high
but the food is very much up to par
Its fresh, and clean, and very interesting
I have gone 3 times to this restaurant, and eachtime the food wows me
WOWS me
I am not a foodie by far but into good quality cuisine
Since Megu serve the freshest and most organic ingredients, I can taste the difference when I dine else where
My friends and I enjoy trying their various dishes each time and appreciate their quality cuisine
Ambiance is very modern but elegant and yet very traditional
I have great experiences each time
I went to dine here with my friends one night on a weekday
The restaurant was fairly full for a Wednesday, and I didnt mind the 30 minute wait in the bar
Its a beautiful bar that its really hard to stay disgruntled for long! The drinks got our night going
When we did sit down to eat, the food was
something that I have never had before
The fish especially was so fresh and the various tartar dishes, (fish, beef) were excellent!!! There is so much to enjoy on the menu its a little bit overwhelming
So we stuck with the smaller dishes and shared and that worked out well
And everything we had was so unique and wonderful
But my favorite has got to be the cream shrimp dish
We fought over the last bit of that
I love Japanese food and eat sushi often
Nobu has been a go-to spot for years
But ever since I discovered MEGU, I have been hooked
It's really not as expensive as everyone thinks
I've splurged on occasion, but have also enjoyed a great meal with friends for under $100 a person
The staff is incredibly knowlegeable -- and friendly
They know what they're serving and take pride in its presentation
The MAIMON seafood tower GLOWS with color and ice, as does the Fresh Edamame on Branches -- a must have starter
They don't rush you out just so they can turn the table
You don't get that very often in New York City
Which is just another reason why I'd reccommend this restaurant
It's the perfect spot to gather with friends and coworkers
If SEX AND THE CITY were still on the air, the girls would be dining here
Food, when it finally arrived (after much confusion), was good
However, overall experience (with such stratospheric prices) was absolutley shameful
9:15 Reservation
seated for dinner 10:45! Apparently the greedy owners overbooked reservations by extreme amount
When Ryan Seacrest arrived (without reservation )he was seated promtly, while many real players of nyc awaited a table
To be clear, Ryan is no Robert Dinero, and this proves that even ridiculed fame gets you treated better than no fame
The whole experience (120/pp w/out wine) was a complete trainwreck
Particularly inexcusable for such an expensive place that has been open long enough to get the kinks out
Clearly the blame rests with Management, as both the fooddecor independent of service were impressive
With many fantastic restaurants to choose from, I would never go back
Bottom line
extremely ticked off
(btw
i am generally very patient and foregiving, and do not criticize lightly)
With the one exception of decor, Megu is a massive disappointment in every area
The food is mediocre, the portions are tiny, and the presentation is overly gimmicky, so much so that it's annoying and interferes with the flow of the meal
Example: if you want more wasabi, instead of just giving you more, they call over a guy dressed in an armani suit to grind out a tiny amount about the size of a pea on your plate
the whole process takes about 5 minutes and is just awkward and unnecessary
The service is shockingly poor across the board
The waiter's knowledge of the menu and ability to make recommendations were ridiculously bad, requests weren't observed effectively, and our water and wine glasses were not kept full
Finally, the value was laughable
A grand for 2 couples to have a mediocre dinner with poor service? Come on now
Didn't have a long wait, but definitely know why now
I don't mind paying high prices for a nice meal with a nice atmosphere, but this really was the worst dinner experience I've had in NY
Food was extremely disappointing and the overpriced bill made the experience even worse
Let me start by saying I dine in NYC restaurants on a frequent basis
constantly looking for that perfect combination of trendy, great food/service and amazing atmosphere
Well, from what I had heard and pictures I saw, I thought Megu would fit the bill
Let me tell you I was WRONG
It was truly the worst food I have ever had
The waiters were nice and the place was georgous as far as design, BUT the food - wow, I am speechless
Oh, and I did I mention is was extremely expensive to top it all off?!! Again, since I go out to dinner several times a week in NY, I am used to paying high prices and do not mind at all
Save yourself the pain and money, eat first and go for drinks only!
Visited Megu on an expense account so cost was not really an issue - we wanted great food and great atmosphere
We got the atmosphere, kind of, but overall, we all left disappointed and hungry

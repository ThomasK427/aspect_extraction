One guy at another table joined the band and sang
It was awesome
If you life good, authentic mexican, you have to try this place! Lively decor too! Would definitely go back
This place used to be really awesome before it expanded
The service was great and the food was the best Mexican in the city
Now it is over-crowded, the service is pathetic, and the mariachi band includes an un-muted trumpet which makes it impossible to carry on a conversation
In addition, on my last visit I was served a chicken enchilada and there were several pieces of bone in it which I almost choked on
This little place started out as a whole in the wall
It has become the hottest place on the upper westside
The food is fabulous and true to the Mexican cuisine
They have 80 different types of tequila
Margarita's to die for
The service is the best feature, they are fast and polite
The Mariachi's are awesome
The lines waiting to get in go around the corner but due to their efficiency the wait is never too long, but definitely worth the wait
I had fun while I was here
The food isn't that great (actually--it's pretty bad) but the environment and atmosphere is awesome
Kind of loud, but still very fun
I would probably go here again when I have people visit from out of town
This is one of the best mexican restaurants in New York
Courteous staff, plentiful food, live music
You really get your monies worth at this restaurant
They make guacomole right at your table! The best Mexican food around
The atmosphere is friendly and jovial
there's even a serenader walking around with a guitar
I great date place
What a fun place! Mariachi band, made at the table guacamole, fresh food and free pours of jose cuervo at birthday celebrations
Good standard Mexican food, great drinks, very festive atmosphere with musicians although do not try for heavy conversation
Sometimes the staff can be overbearing--too solicitous
Oops! They accidentally; charged us twice for nearly every item we ordered
If we had had more tequila maybe we wouldn't have noticed
Beware!! Check your check
The manager was not apologetic and offered no explanation (or complementary dessert or drink)
Our waitress simply disappeared
This place is great
The pomegranate (sp) margs are the best and the food is wonderful too
The servers are extremely friendly and laid back
We came in a crowd and they were very hospitable and friendly to everyone in our crazy group
The mariachi band that walked around during dinner was fun and like I stated before the food is delish!!
MaMa Mexico is an incredible place
five brothers from Pueblo, Mexico have turned their dream of bringing the best of their tradition to the US
don't look for tacos, burritos and tamales
listen to the special features along with the menu of more than 100 offerings
crab stuffed shrimp, superb paella, steaks, lamb chops, veal, freshest and most creative seafood
along with margaritas, sangria and a mariachi band
This is a don't miss it place
Wow, this place is delicious! The food is fantastic, the portions are insane and the price can't be beat! If you are in the mood for home-cooked food with aromas that sweep YOU away and NOT your wallet
good luck beating this find
Try the sirloin steak, the flan, the chicken and the tostones
Just to clarify: the food is Dominican, not Mexican or Spanish
There are 2 more locations further north as well
I love this place because the food is great and the price is too good to pass up
Best bets: Rotisserie chicken, pepper steak, cuban sandwich, steak sandwich, stewed chicken or beef
basically you can't go wrong
The coffee is delicious and only $1
Parking around the 97th location is impossible
The 175th street and Broadway location has decent street parking during the day
The 231st and Broadway location has the best parking situation
As you can see, I love this restaurant, I've been going to their Uptown locations for years
Great to find a place that has authentic spanish food-though their listed as mexican its actually more dominican to me
Make sure to try their coffee to put a jump in your day----much better than Starbucks and only a $1 !!!!
Absurdly cheap! My brother and I shared a whole chicken and had side dishes of brown rice and fried plantains
Then we had flan for dessert and coffee
Total bill: something like $11
You cannot possibly spend more than $6/person
We laughed outloud when the bill came
Furthermore, it's a fun joint and as real as the streets
The Scene Columbia academics, local hospital workers and tourists who snap pictures by the famous neon sign outside flock here daily
The clean, sunny interior looks nothing like Jerry and the gang's dingy haunt, but it showcases fun ephemera like "Seinfeld" cast autographs and press clips on how the diner inspired the musical ode by Suzanne Vega
The Food Expect standard burgers, gyros, triple-decker clubs and comforting open-faced sandwiches dripping with gravy or oozing with cheese--reliable food that's for eating quickly before running back to class or work
(The service doesn't take kindly to lingerers during peak times
) Fries are always hot out of the fryer--crisp on the outside, and soft but not soggy on the inside, and the coffee is good and frequently brewed
Fountain treats, like the cherry vanilla ice cream and classic banana split, are winners
We were pleasantly surprised to find the food at Tom's to be incredibly tasty
We ordered the chicken fingers, pastrami, fries, chicken noodle soup, pancakes, chocolate milkshake and chocolate ice cream
All of these basics were done very well
Especially enjoyable were the chicken fingers which were the best we had ever had
The coating was golden brown and crispy, and the chicken was juicy, tender and flavorful
We will most certainly return to try other enticing menu options
There is bad food, and there is unedible food
The food here is unedible
The servers are stupid and dont take notice of anything you need
take a pretty picture of the outside and walk on by
I don't care about its Seinfeld history - the food absolutely disgusting
I wouldn't eat there if it was free
Too bad there's not that many 24 hour diners in this area, because sometimes it feels like you're forced to go there when you need a quick meal
I find their prices to be jacked up way too much
This is most likely because: 1
Columbia University is right they and they may feel students have money for pay that tuition, then they can afford an overpriced meal
2
Seinfeld
Their claim to fame
It's even more horrible that they get away with it
I've been to this dinner a handful of times, and I've never been blown away with their menu
5 bux for 2 eggs and bacon? Call me cheap, but youv'e got to be kidding me
Their service is alright, but I've never felt bad leaving a bad tip there
Unless it's a must, you would find better elsewhere
some of the waitresses are nice
but there's one lady that just makes it go right out of the door
with this lady

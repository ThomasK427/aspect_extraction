It was just brisket, a little chewy
The bbq sauce was not very spicy and did not have any punch to it really
The mashed potatoes were pretty good
The bologna sandwich was big and stuffed plenty and was good
The ribs were okay, but not that big and kind of bland
The food needs to be kicked up! It needs flavor!
This was one of the most unsatisfying meals I've had in a long time
One of the vodka drinks was mixed incorrectly and had to be returned
The caesar salad and cole slaw are mediocre
The extremely dry and lean beef ribs were so heavily encrusted with black pepper that we had to immediately take Zantac
The house bbq sauce tasted like ketchup watered down with salsa juice
Bbq potato chips could have been from Frito-Lay's
Don't waste your money eating at this restaurant
Read a great review in the NYT this week and thought I'd give it a shot
Like the previous reviewer said, the appetizers were by far the best part (chipotle chicken wings)
The ribs were not great
Mine were fatty and tough, my date's (a different variety) were dry and boring
Neither had the sauce or the kick of the bar-b-que appetizer -- the irony is thick
Service was a disaster as well -- the entrees came out before both the bread pickles and the appetizer, then were snatched away and returned 20 minutes later (apres appetizer) after having no doubt sat beneath a heat lamp the entire time
The moral -- you get what you pay for
Nice interior and service was good but the ribs were a disappointment
Too dry and lacked taste
Shrimp creole was below average
Mashed potatoes were poor
Mac and cheese was good
Good beer list
The drab interior and mediocre bar could have been overcome and I hoped the real money invested went into the food
I was disappointed by the meat, which reminds me a cow which had been laying in the desert for months - dry, sinewy
Can't believe they actually presented it to me, which leads to the service
HORRIBLE
After the appetizers, which were the only saving grace (BBQ chips, spinach, fried bread), the servers descending and without asking started taking our plates away
We asked to wait and they argued with us
About half way through these same rubes returned to try to clear our plates, which we were still eating from
and this is at 10 p
m
, so there's no rush to get us out
Worst service I've had in five years in NYC
I really enjoyed my experience at Blue Smoke
I went with 4 friends on a Sat night
It's not a sexy place (the lighting could be better), but the service was superb and the food delicious
Beef brisket, macaroni and cheese, onion rings, ribs--all of it was terrific
The sausage appetizer was so-so, but other than that, we left extremely satisfied
AND FULL--all for a decent price (~50/pp)
Way to go, Blue Smoke!
I just went to Blue Smoke and I think it was fantastic! The waitress mentioned that they'd had some problems and had been changing things around for a while
But I think they've got it right now
I tried my boyfriend's ribs and they were delicious, melt-in-your-mouth juicy
but not toooo messy
The mac 'n' cheese was incredible! I had a mountain of pulled pork that I couldn't stop eating! The service was friendly and the jazz and blues playing all night on the stereo was a great touch! I definitely recommend this place!
I read all these opposing reviews and had to try it for myself
as for the 'dry' ribs I read about
what dry? the meat was very moist and flavorful
Maybe some of the reviewers are used to the sloppy-joe type of bbq swimming in sauce
Is that what they meant by dry? This style of BBQ is about the meat
not the sauce
and then when I learned all the meats are free-range and antibiotic-free, I was so pleased
that fact alone gives Danny a leg up on everyone
I think the desserts are a perfect compliment to the meal as well as the place as a whole: simple (no 'selling air' here!) and good
even 'wholesome
' Like Mom's (maybe a little better)! the prices great - both for food and drink
juke box is superb
but this place wasn't a bomb, either
All the food was fine, but not memorable
We had BBQ experts from TX and KY - neither raved nor panned
The maccheese was OK
The asparagus spears were good
The fry bread was the one stand-out -- perfecty done without too much grease; nice dips and sides with it
Good beer selection and the usual genial service of D
Meyer repute
They didn't have the famed smoked bologna sandwich that night, so we didn't get to try the much-dished dish
Overal, we had higher expectations and were a bit let down
However, we will be back but not necessarily for the food
I've been to Blue smoke on 5/28 and enjoyed the food very much
My girl friend had the memphis style pork ribs and I had the Texas beef ribs
both were yammy! I asked to see the famous pit and the manager took us on a tour
The positive reviewers here (if they don't work for or know Danny) lack basic knowledge of truly fine barbecue
I lived in the south for ten years, and in Kansas City for four
The food Blue Smoke serves couldn't make it in a gas station in those locales
The meat is bland; the sauces are mealy; the veggies too al dente
If this stuff appeals to real new yorkers, then -- god help us -- they may not actually know everything! If you want something closer to real barbeque, try sticking a Ballpark frank on a hibachi
The bad 3 review listed below is clearly from someone that doesn't know anything about barbecue
I'm originally from Texas and have only lived in New York for a year
In that year I have been hard pressed to find good barbecue up until the arrival of Blue Smoke
I'm a tough critic of barbecue and Blue Smoke passed the test
The baby back ribs were plentiful and full of taste
The brisket could be cut with a fork and had an incredible smoke flavor that would be tough to replicate
One thing that will stick out is the customer service afforded to you and your company at this restaurant
I forgot our waiters name but none the less he was superb
Strongly recommend trying out Blue Smoke
Almost forgot the most important thing
The beer is ice cold and compliments the meal very well
I go here for lunch
Cool staff, always nice and helpful
One of the best deals for $5 and under-large selection of Thai favorites, many spicy (which I dig)
No worries, water supply is on hand
This plac has one of the best price to quality ratios in the city
Highly underrated, highlu recommended
the lunch special is the best deal
buffet style lunch special has a rotating lineup so you never get bored
and for $5 you can get a hearty meal

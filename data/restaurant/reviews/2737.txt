I recommend this place
The place looks old enough, mature enough and certainly serves the best meat I have ever tasted, including the famous Florentine steak in Toscana
With no much-ado-about food yet with knowing how aged meat should be treated
To the very bones indeed, way to go - keep on the good work lads, you are the greatest
LIVING IN WILLAMSBURG FOR 12 YEARS THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME TO PERTER LUGER I WAS SCARED OF THE PRICE? WELL IT WAS NOT CHEAP BUT WHAT A DINNER I SPENT MORE AT THE OUTBACK AND IN NO WAS DOES THE OUTBACK COMPARE I CAN NOT EXPLAIN I GUESS THEY HAVE THERE OWN COWS FROM OUTER SPACE CAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO GET THIS TASTE FROM A REG STEAK
The most overrated steakhouse with rude waiters, no credit cards and you need a limo to get there
At a loss what all the fuss is about
This steak melts in your mouth like butter!!! A must try for anybody in the New York area
Also, try an order of the bacon-its awesome!
every thing was good and i enjoy the sec
there i came with a group from AMEX STOCKS in manhanttan everyone enjoy
The steak is awesome! You must come here once just to experience it! The spinach is delicious
Steak for 2,3,4 the price you cant argue with - cause when you go to other restaurants you pay 1/3 more for lesser quality
go once and enjoy - forget the great rolls then you wont have room for the steak!
Best Steak in the Entire World, Fantastic Business Casual Atmosphere and Great Service!
Overrated, one type of steak, no variety
Very limited menu
A bit pricey for the offering
The food wine is excellent the service is very satisfactory
Peter Lugar is great for small or large groups
ANY true New Yorker will be SHOCKED to see that the famous Palm Restaurant is not only NOT #1 on your list
but not even included!??! For those who don't know
best steak AND lobster for 30+ years in NYC
If you like the cut they serve,, it is the best
Limited menu but for STEAK,,, and giant onion and tomato salad
Peter Luger is by far the BEST steakhouse == definite masculine, comfortable Old World ambience, dark wood furnishings, friendly but all-business highly professional waiters -- and of course, what we all go there for
GREAT steaks, great food
I would only recommend this restaurant to a friend if waiting at least 40 minutes for your RESERVATION is acceptable, and you don't mind paying for relatively standard fare
Although the steak was wonderful, it was just steak and very pricey at that
The sides are what you might be served in any other restaurant
Nothing really sticks out
Our waiter, however, was excellent and so were our mixed drinks
Among the best I've had, with the exception of Campbell's Apartment in Manhattan
I believe Peter Luger's is a wonderful steak but consistantly receives ratings higher than warrented
Its the place to be and I think people are afraid to be honest with their rating
The menu is limited and one does not always get The best piece of beef in town
Best Steak in New York is in Brooklyn! A steak you can dream about and actually still taste it
the side dishes are fantastic
Tomatoes, Onions, Creamed Spinach, potatoes all great
The only thing left to say is WOW!
The food was excellent
Service superior
Have been recomending and will be recommending to future NY visitors
i don't know about anyone else, but i go to a steak house for the STEAK!!
there is none finer than lugars
I have been going there for over 30 years
most recently to the one on long island (for those who need a litte more ambiance)
the steak sauce does suck, but only a novice would attempt to use anything but salt on such a fine piece of meat
blows away all of the competition (and i have been everywhere)
end of story!
Though we had a reservation, and it still took them 45 minutes to seat us, it was worth it
Steak for 2 was delicious, as were the side dishes
It was very pricey, but worth the money if you are willing to spend it on a meal I would definitely go back (as soon as I can get a reservation)
The food outweighs the flaws
The food will eventually make you outweigh Anna Nicole Smith
Simply the best steak in a country with great steak
Has any body ever actually been to this place?? IT IS BY FAR, THE WORST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD
HOW CAN THEY NOT HAVE A FILET?? I DON'T THINK NEW YORKERS HAVE EVER HAD A GOOD STEAK
I TRAVEL AND EAT OUT ALOT AT SOME VERY EXCLUSIVE PLACES
THE BEST STEAK IS AT RUTH CHRIS, I SUGGEST YOU ALL GO THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Excellent Steaks, the attitude of the Servers could be a little better but the food makes up for everything
What's wrong with you people who dis Peter Luger?! Luger's is the best! When I ate there, everything was fabulous- the service was top notch, and the steaks were incredible (as were the side dishes of creamed spinach and potatoes)
The long wait for a reservation and the crazy seating times (I could only get Monday night at 9:45 PM, despite calling a month and a half in advance) are a small price to pay for such a wonderful eating experience
Incredibly delicious steak which I have never experienced anywhere else, consistently perfect time after time and year after year
The tomato salad and creamed spinach are a must
Expect very professional but brusque service- just part of the atmosphere
you say steak in new york city and automatically people say peter luger's
but that's nothing more than hype, cliche and people not knowing any better
one should always be weary of a steakhouse - especially one that claims to be as good as luger's - that needs a steak SAUCE
a true great steak can and will stand without it
but the main problem is that luger's believes a steak should be cooked one way - rare, regardless if you, the customer likes it medium well
is it good? sure
is at great as everyone says? hell no
but the bacon, that's a different story
the starters were very good the tomato and onion was great the tomatoes were like they were from your backyard the bacon was great i was told by my wife the shrimp cocktail was fantastic the bread was good not as good as mortons the steaks were a disapointment very bland all you could taste was the burnt butter and a little tough desert was good get plenty of schlag on whatever you choose
Where's Ruth Chris? All real NYers know Ruth Chris is #1
They're not even in the top 10! Who rates these anyway?
Peter Luger's is a decent steakhouse but certainly no better or worse than many others within New York City
It is far too crowded with a very limited menu
The prices aren't warranted
I would rate this restaurant as just average
This is the most spectacular steak house in all of New York
Outside of the Chocolate Godiva cake that Morton's offers, it can't compare
Standing at the bar waiting for your table is a nightmare (especially when you are with a large group)
The steaks are good but to travel there from Manhattan when there are other options that are just as good - and in my opinion better - is not wise
Bensons, S W's, Sparks make P
L
's a viable option - not vice versa
I had a good experience at Peter Luger
The waiters were nice and helpful
The porterhouse was amazing as advertised
But I have to say, I'm a naysayer
I just prefer having a choice of what to eat
Not only is there very little on the menu besides steak, but you really have no choice of what cut of meat to get
Plus, I'm not real fond of the idea of sharing a steak
I want my own hunk of meat so I can slice it the way I want
The final negative here
the sides leave a lot to be desired and the sauce is revoltingly sweet
That being said, it's a unique and memorable place and the steak is awesome
But you should be warned that you really have no choice in what to eat

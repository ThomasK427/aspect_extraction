They just weren't flavorful
The mojitos were great, so maybe the margaritas were just a one-time thing
I recently had a birthday dinner at Agozar with a party of about 15 people
The dining area was too small to comfortably accommodate a large group of people
The food was great and there was a variety to choose from on the menu
The service could have been more attentive
If your looking for a romantic setting, Agozar is sure to bring you closer together
I went here on Saturday and overall, the ambience is nice, a bit small but cozy
As far as the food, I highly recommend the breaded bistec which was great! 4-5 tapas is a perfect size for two people
I don't recommend the drinks here though, I had the sangria and it was probably the weakest sangria I've ever had
The concept of this place is outstanding, but the execution need work
The drinks we had (margaritas) were horrible
It took the bartender ten minutes to acknowledge me and my date and another ten to actually make our drinks
It did not appear that busy and she was humorless and almost rude
The ambiance was energetic, but a bit too loud
The hostess and wait staff were extremely charming, but seemed frantic and understaffed
The food was good, but overpriced for what it was
I was left with the impression that there was no captain of this ship
Discovered Agozar after a night of bad Theater at the Bowery, stopped in for a chaser and discovered great cocktails and latin music at Agozar
Food was not especially inspiring! This would make a great Salsa dancing club!
Had a b-day dinner there on Saturday - great atmosphere, great drinks, service was actually very friendly, helpful, and prompt
The food was decent but nothing to write home about
Would go there for drinks/date/b-day celebrations again definitely, but not for the culinary experience
The food was terribly overpriced for the portions and taste
REAL Cuban plantains are not dry and bland like they were at Agozar, the pork was tough and dry, the mussels and shrimp were the only descent thing there
The mojitos were terrible, as the mint was just thrown on top and not crushed with the sugar and ice
I left there feeling robbed
Agozar better agozar the unwarranted hype for now, because all of the awesome reviews here are simply, NOT TRUE
There is no dish that is $7
50
The shrimp dish is $12, it is served with top quality chorizo
and 7 shrimp are served
The accompanying sauce is a white wine and butter reduction with holland peppers and Florida Key limes
Platanos are normally 2-3 for $1 in stores and 1 1/2 are used for the tostones dish
As for portions being small--the below reviewer is bogus and has not had the pleasure of experiencing Agozar! Restaurant and Lounge
I was curious to know what a Cuban Tapas was
Since they don't have them in Cuba nor any Cuban I know has ever heard of such thing
Well, I regret finding out
The portions are so little these arent tapas theyre samples
Very expensive samples
4 small shrimps $7
50? 6 tostones for $3? (Platanos in the supermarket are 8 for $1
They use half of one
) My friends had trouble on deciding what was had less taste the food or the Mojitos
Please save your time and money
We were 3 people, spent $100 and went home hungry and sober
Helena's why did you leave us?????????????
The dishes themselves were very tasty, but the service was incredibly disjointed
they forgot one of our orders of ceviche, and it arrived with the check! The tables were small, cramped and the chairs uncomfortable
Also, don't sit near the back door when its cold!
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is a lot of fun
However, the bar/drinks service is extremely slow because they haven't figured out the right staffing mix yet
I guess they didn't know they'd be this popular! Great drinks too!
By all means you need to go to AGOZAR everything about this place made my friends and I very happy
Not able to find 1 thing to complain about
Go To AGOZAR
Went to agozar with a couple friends the other night looking to get out of the cold
and were treated to delicious drinks (especially the caprihinias!) and tasty authentic Cuban food served tapas style
The place looked great and everyone was grooving to the sounds of live Cuban music
Service was friendly and the drinks kept coming
almost fast enough to forget about the cold! Agozar is just what the Bowery needed! I recommend to one and all
I was interested to check this place out because I love Cuban food and was excited to try a new place on the Bowery
The decor put me off to begin with-it looked dated at around 1987, didn't look finished and the colors while trying, I imagine, to be hot hot hot left me cold cold cold
We were told the food was basically tapas and so my friend and I tried a variety of dishes most of which I found bland and overpriced
We also ordered a round of mojitos, which took forever to arrive but were fine, although for 10 buck a pop they should be
Overall it was a dissapointing meal in a tacky setting
checked it out wanting to explore some new spots
this place has awesome mojitos and you gotta try the ceviche
i didnt even know what it was but damn its tasty!
a cool munch and hang spot with class but not the snootiness that you get from some similar places
I was very impressed with Agozar! The food is great and the service is very good
Everyone that works there makes you feel very comfortable
I've been there twice and the music was better the second time
It had more newer dance songs and 80's hits than the first time
I hope the owners decide to go with that format more than the traditional Cuban music
I would recommend this place to all my friends and family
Great for groups sharing, tons of Cuban tapas to choose from
Lounge is comfy for after you meal, great atmosphere to kick back and have some margaritas and martinis, tons of flavors to choose from
Checked out Agozar last week -the food and drinks were fantastic (must try the croquettes and empenadas!)
The was service was friendly and attentive, which like the warm decor (and great separate bar/restaurant setup), and authentic Cuban music creates a chill, inviting vibe
Definitely a great new addition to the neighborhood
FOOD EXCELLLENT
DRINKS EXCELLENT
THE STAFF EXCELLENT!!! WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY
I am so excited to be the first to rate this excellent establishment
I was just passing by, and decided to go inside, and found a comfortable and relaxing bar/restaurant environment
The food was incredible, and the people were very pleasant - I had a great time, and would recommend it to anyone
The dishes are excellent at great prices
The atmosphere is comfortable and fun
Amazing and inexpensive food, pleasant waiting staff and a number of great drinks - a great place to eat, party or relax in the back of the bar
Try it out and you will be hooked
The Scene Despite the cool mood that the blue-toned decor and frosted glass suggest, the feeling here is very warm, with gracious servers, vibrant music, and a sociable atmosphere
The setting is uptown Caribbean glam: glittering seashells overlay the tables and chairs, and the bar is swathed in rainbow light
The Food Though it's intrinsically anything but light, DR-K's Dominican fare is executed with finesse using excellent ingredients
And it's delicious, particularly the meaty specialties like a massive mixed grill of steak, pork, chicken, lobster, shrimp and octopus
Sea bass, served atop a light lobster mash, is sweet and succulent
Pork pernil, a giant, well-crusted roast, makes a hefty, toothsome meal
An appetizer of coconut-crusted shrimp leaves one wanting much more
Only occasionally, as with the cloying ceviche trio, does a dish fall short
For dessert, the creamy, fruity flan is a winner, as is the tres-leches cake

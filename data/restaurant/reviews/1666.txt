I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good indian food
Unfortunately, you have to pay a lot more compared to the other indian restaurants on Indian row
This is the real stuff
I do like going into the really cheap and tacky indian places on occassion, but it's so dark you usually can't identify what type of meat you are eating
So, for the most part I hit Haveli
It is clean, nicely decorated, staff is attentive and the food is delicious
A big beer, two apps and two entrees will run you a mere $45 at most
I go for the biryani, vindaloo, and stuffed breads
It's worth your while to try it out
It won't break your piggy bacnk
Believe me
This restaurant is not worth 9 points
I went there after reading the excellent reviews and was quite disatisfied with the food
The food was very AVERAGE quality
The fried appetizer crackers were stale
it smelled like it was fried 3 weeks in advance
Really no excuse there
My lamb dish smelled aswell
Not a stale smell, but the strong odor of the lamb
It was too strong and not prof
made
Loud patrons set against the otherwise cozy romantic and dark moody interior
Anyways, I would not return there
If you want fine Indian food without overpaying, take a car or train out to Jackson Heights Queens
you will not regret it
Take care
i love haveli
some of the best indian food in the city, but you pay for it
Good news! a restaurant with great food service that's reasonably priced
It's my birthday today and my request is to go to Haveli
The food is fabuous - always fresh a very expansive menu
the mango lassis are great, too!  The service is great - though sometimes a tad slow on busy nights
I took my mom here while she was in town visiting
This was her first Indian Dining Experience
It was perfect
The service was impecable and the food was delicious
Definitely the best in NY
Doesn't look like much from the street, but nice ambience, great food, very reasonably priced and good service! You can't ask for more! I'll definitely go back
Haveli looks to distinguish itself from its neighbors in decor and presentation--and they do
Whether the food tastes better because it IS better or because it was more of a production to get it is up for debate, though
I did enjoy the dessert of sorbet packed into the skin of its parent fruit (an orange peel, for instance)
Cute!
Really popular for brunch
The food is acceptable, but the smoothies are the real treat! On the weekends getting there at 11:55 means getting a table, noon means waiting for one, so go a little early
You truly need a scorecard to keep track of the cheap indian places on 6th street as fas as which ones are good and which ones blow
Sonali used to be great, then it got sold and sucked and now i think its defunct
Raj Mahal, at last eat, is top o the pops on idian row (for my money)
they do the special ($11
95 for wine/dessert/entree/appetizers), but the food is actually top quality (not baluchis top quality, but still good)
Ask the waiter to chill the red wine fo 10-15 minutes before serving because they really do not store wine well at this place
But the service is attentive and, ehy, its dirt cheap
But do bring the maalox particularly for the unititiated
food is ok, servers are the worst i've ever seen (especially one in particular, you can figure which one out if you go there) don't even pay attention to whether you're done or not (once had to wait 20 minutes after eating to get their attention to get the bill, and its a pretty small restaurant)
I ordered a 5
95 prix free lunch once, and 5 minutes later decided i wanted to add on a chicken dish which made the price 7 dollars
they didn't have to change anything about the menu except add a leg of chicken seperatley and the guy mumbled very rudely that I had already ordered and I should've decided earlier
go for the price, not the service
Lured in by the live music which was good, scared out by the food which was bad
I was given something that I didn't order, although the waiter knew fully well what I ordered
The waiters were rude, and the appetizer dip had bits of bread in it from someone else's dinner
The food was sub-par even for e6th street, greasy samosa and watery sauce
The food was pretty good and relatively inexpensive
The staff however, needs to be injected with a little dose of charisma, but that's asking too much
The live music is awesome
The food is good and cheap, typical of e6th st, but what makes this place stand out is the live music and the incredible tabla player
The place is always packed with musicians who come to hear him
I've tried a good many Indian restaurants in the City, and Calcutta is definitely among the top 5
Excellent food, very clean with nice decor, friendly staff and live sitar players, but best of all is the value for the money
You can stuff your tummy to the fullest for under $20
Now we're talking!
I had never tried indian cuisine before my trip to this restaurant
The food was pretty good! the garlic pita bread was amazing and the indian beer was quite good as well
I went with a couple of friends, and we ended eating and drinking alot and not paying a hefty price
There was nice live music and our waiter was very patient with us as we asked him what he recommended from the menu because we had no idea what to order
My fiance and I ate at Calcutta the other night
We love many foods but were skeptical about Indian food
This experience changed that
Calcutta is a truly excellent restaurant--from the food to the entertainment to the wine and dessert--we loved it all!! And there are many healthy choices too! If you are wondering where to go to try somthing different I highly recommend Calcutta! We were even lucky enough to meet the owner responsible for keeping quality food and service in his restaurant!
This has been my favorite restaurant in Manhattan for years
The food is so amazingly fresh and very reasonably priced, the atmosphere is great and I hardly ever have had to wait for a table for two
The thing that knocks my socks off every time is how quickly the food is at the table after you order it- great for when you have a spouse/ date that gets cranky and impatient when they are hungry, or of course if you want to eat a good meal, but quickly, because you have somewhere else to be! A great location for a post MET museum meal, even though my husband insists we trek up there no matter how inconvenient if we are not in the area
There are a lot of great restaurants in this city of course, and good italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in New York, but this one stands out with it's fresh ingredients and the dishes don't have that oily, greasy italian food quality that weighs you down
I live 2 blocks from Tiramisu and have been going here for approx
7yrs a couple times a month
The service is pretty slow and sometimes rude
but I haven't had this experience since they sorta know us
From looking around though I can see others are not very happy!
I think the complaints about service from other reviewers are proof that people tend to post reviews after bad experiences but not good ones
We live within 2 blocks of Tiramisu and eat there at least a couple of times per month
We have NEVER had a problem with the service
The food is consistently good and a great value for the money
I wouldn't necessarily travel across town to eat here, but for locals it is a great place to have nearby
After ordering my dinner and having it come to the table totally wrong, the manager argued with me over whether my meal was correct or not, and further argued that the mushrooms in my dish were really the eggplant that I ordered
Finally, after 10 min, he took the meal back and brought me another, again totally wrong
At that point, the manager told me the eggplant was under the pasta as if it was actually there
It was by far the worst restuarant experience and most awful food I've ever had
don't do it!!!
Stumbled on this place on a Friday evening
Service was very questionable, seemed there was only 1 waiter for a full house and the host was extremely unfriendly and refused to bring my table water after waiting for a full 15 minutes
WHen I politely asked for a water he pointed to the waiter and looked the other way! unbelieveable

i actually feel like i should keep it a secret
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
An excellent service
I am a die hard peep lover
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks
This is the best thing in Soho
Not pretentious and very economical
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great
The prices were fantastic
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here
My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me
I love the atmorphere @ peep! The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal
And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!! It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT
IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT
THE FOOD IS CREATIVE (W/ ASIAN FLARE) AND BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE
PERFECT FOR DATES!
This is my place to eat out
Love calamari and duck
Last week I went to Peep with a couple of friends again and was totally dissapointed about what's happening with the place that I thought it would be my favorite if I lived in this town
We were completely ignored
Although they might say that they were busy but what we saw was a group of waiters talking to each other while 2 boys, I guessed they were busboy, were running back and forth like crazy
We tried to get the attention from our waitress ( the chinese-like with weird-eye girl) but nothing happened, she totally avoided to talke to us
Fortunately, we got the busboy, this busboy was so nice to us, although he was so busy
Last but not least, don't expect anything from the Brazilian manager, he's useless!!! no service mind!!!
he might have thought that he was hired to be a model!!!
eellll
I went to this Thai place because of the glowing reviews on citysearch, but I must admit I left dissapointed
Sure the restaurant location and decor are trendy but the miniscule menu of this place offers little variety and choices
The menu was so small I thought I was handed the wine list
I could tell it's one of these untraditional hip Thai places that they call fusion when I ate the much hyped beef ragout
The sauce tasted like italian marinara mixed with soy sauce! I guess the fusion there was Thai fused with Olive Garden
Believe me, I'm not one of these Thai rookies who base all Thai places by the Pad Thai because it's the only dish they recognize on the menu
You know it's bad when the only thing they boast about is the cool bathroom! Trust me, after this place, you will deffinitely need one
definitely worth checking out at least once
it's a very trendy hip place in SOHO
great place to meet and have drinks with friends
must warn you however this place can get really crowded on the weekends
recommend going for the ambience
the food is decent but not worth the little that you get for the price
I just happened to stumble on to this gem
A good value with a incredible vibe, in addition the wait and bar staff were friendly, welcoming and fun
Peep is good for out of towners, defintely not locals
The food is good, very good, but very little portions
Don't think of sharing, if you are share a few plates
The pad-thai serving was a handful sized
The dumplings are fantastic
Tried it, but don't think I'd go back unless I had guests in town - who don't eat a lot
I've been to Peep many times before and had a great experience every time
until today
When my group complained to our waiter about a cake cutting fee that involved no cutting, the manager came over to the table and basically told us that it was our fault for not knowing that their policy was just to serve the plates, not to cut
Although we did not mind $2/ person cutting fee, we certainly mind the way the manager treated us
Just because an 18% gratuity (which was taxed) is included in the bill does not mean that you don't have to pay attention to the service, let alone be outright rude to the customers
Despite the good food, good atmosphere, and cheap price, I will not return to the restaurant with that kind of service
I've been to Peep several times and the food has always been good
The restaurant has a variety of menu selections and for the price you pay, it's worth it
However, on my last visit the service was so bad I'll never return
The host sat us at the table next to the bathroom
We had a party of five and he stuck a chair on the end of the table so that anyone who wanted to go to the bathroom kept bumping into the person in the chair
We asked to move several times and although other tables were available the host would not change our seats
He was so rude, we just took up another table
Plus, the restaurant charged us tax on the food we ate AND the 18% gratuity charged on groups of five or more, a no no
Peep is such a trendy trap
Like a tourist trap, this place attracts people who are looking to check out the fun and voyeuriustic bathrooms! The food was okay in my book - but the drinks are fun, flavorful and inventive! There are so many of these thai places popping up, that I am quite honestly getting a little sick of thai! So - the fact that this spot has great bathrooms and drinks definitely keeps it on the top of my thai list
You MUST visit this place once
And if you're looking to try thai again - go somewhere else - (perhaps SEA in Williamsburg or ISLE on Bleeker)
great place to take nyc newbies/visitors
brought couple of old college friends here and they were impressed with the trendy style and atmosphere
definitely try as many appetizers as you can
pad thai, and most other entrees i tried were just good as well
i like this place more for the experience than for the food, but the food ranks up there as well
don't forget to wash your hands before your meal
Peep is my favorite Thai resaurant in the City
The Calimari app is some of the best I've ever had
You'll get high quality food for reasonable prices! Everyone I have ever taken there said the food was great!
I've been to PEEP several times and it's a great place for out-of-towner, make sure they visit the bathroom
Fun for small crowds, but not a romantic place
Food is great, with some classic Thai dishes and a few surprisingly creative plates
My favorite is the seared snapper
Most of the food is pretty good and well priced
Disappointed in the ducktastes like they just bought it from Chinatown and drowned it in their own sauce
Nice design concepts but the elements don't tie together
The acoustics are horrible
It's definitely not a romantic place
For groups, it's not much better
The only person you can hear is the one sitting next to you
There is nothing in that space to absorb the noise
Great concept for the bar stools but EXTREMELY uncomfortable
The bathrooms are very cool unless you end up dining by them
Who wants to sit right outside the bathroom?  The host and wait staff are also lacking
My party of 5 waited 20 minutes before they sat us at a table that was empty that whole time

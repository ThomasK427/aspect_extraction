A tasty but unremarkable burger
I would rather take a burger from Island or Pom Pom Cafe any day
this is a saloon and a not to clean one at that If you crave something while your staving off drunkeness at the bar okay otherwise go to a restaurant
For the last 3 saturday's I have gone to corner bistro at around 1pm-starving and hungover
Frankly, I can't say that I've found a better out of ritual than the one stated above
I walk in and order a cold mug of Sam Adam's while I wait to be seated and get a tasty bacon, cheese burger and delicious fries
I swear to god that these burgers keep my head on straight for the whole week
These burgers are so awesome that I will continue my saturday ritual until I run out of cash
Corner Bistro is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bistro Burger=Overrated, Bistro Burger=Crap
What is it that the place puts in the Burger to brain wash people into thinking that this is good
There are countless places in the city who (on their worst days) can make a better Burger
Seriously, it offends me to think that people honestly think that this crap is good
Maybe I should throw back 4 or 5 drinks at the bar before I get a Burger
Maybe that is what it is, dead taste buds make the Burger better
C'mon everyone, be honest this place is nothing special
The BEST burgers in town, no doubt, this little hole in the wall place always has line out the door and servers running around in a frenzy to cater to everyone's needs! this very popular burger joint has other not so exotic but bbque and delicious fattening foods to cater to your palate, stop by for a beer and burger! or chicken, if you are watching your weight!
Wow, what a great burger! It's so good and tastes even better with a beer
The lines may be a bit long, but once you sit down, service is quick and friendly
I had the bistro burger and would rather have made the same thing at home
Plus, I wouldn't had to wait for a table in the dark, stuffy, overweight-hipster filled bar
Went last night to check out what people claimed to be the best burger and loved it
I am not a big burger eater (never order them actually), but they must do something to the meat to make it taste like that
It isn't tough at all and totally homemade (I think?)
not to mention cheap - as are the beers
Go early so you don't have to stand on line for an hour
It's an institution, and it ROCKS
Two-dollar beers, killer burgers, and a perfect jukebox
Life is good when you're at the Bistro
The burgers were greasy, the beers were cold, the atmosphere was dark and dingy
A good place to go for burgers and beer and nothing else
There's no specifying well, medium or rare here
they cook them just right all the time
Don't forget to order a decently-priced beer, too
The Beastro Burger -- The perfect combination of bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and hamburger
talking is just a waste of time
Sure, the burgers are good, but not good enough to make up for the abominable service and disgusting, filthy atmosphere
This is an ideal place to go at 1 am when you're drunk, but a place to avoid at 7 pm when you're sober
As a cop in NY, I know a good place to eat, and the Corner Bistro is THE BEST burger in the city!
bad food, bad atmosphere and a skuzzy clientel add up to a place to avoid
if you want taste in a burger this is not he place
go to jackson hole for good food and ambience
These burgers are terrific and a good price but the place, esp
the bathroom is filthy
I've trailed off on going there, don't peek in the kitchen, you won't stay
Time after time the burgers are juicey, messy, and wonderful
A McSorley's is perfect to wash one down, especially at $2, and it really hits the spot after a long night of drinking; they serve till 3:30am
You also see the same familiar aged faces behind the bar; a bit uninterested in serving you, but friendly nonetheless
What do you like more, completely addictive patties of greasy beef, or glasses of cheap refreshing beer to wash it down? Well, Corner Bistro asks, Why choose? You can have both in this lovely, quaint n' cozy dive of a restaurant - the waiters aren't nice, but they know their burgers
And you will too after one visit - definitely an invitation to return!
Great burgers and greasy stuff in this dingy, sticky little treasure
On the average night, you're probably going to have to elbow your way in - but there's a reason for that
The burger is simply the best - any way you take it - melting down your throat with a pint to wash it back
Go as late or as early as you can or you could find yourself in a line straight out the door
The burgers are fantastic
not to mention the fries
Definitely worth the wait
Your chin will drip with the luscious juices from this delectible burger
Not only the best burger around town but also the best eats for 5 bucks that you can find
There is no other way to order but bistro style
one word
deepfriedbacon!
and when it's bad it stinks! Overcrowding damages the quality, as my last two visits have yielded overdone burger and underdone fries
I was in love
by I have found another burger and moved on
This is THE place in NY to get a burger
The system of waiting on line in the middle of the bar area to get a table takes a while to get used to but really adds to the place
Waiting for a table is all part of the fun, enjoy a couple of $2 beers and strike up a conversation with the great people that are always waiting for a Burger any time of night at the Corner Bistro!
The Bistro Burgers are thick, cheezy, greasy and loaded with bacon
I have lived in Manhattan for 5 years and this is the best
There's only second after this place
The famous burger did not disappoint
Very juicy and tasty!
I live in Jersey, but any time I'm in the city I've just got to stop by the bistro
Great with cold beer at the bar
I don't ever order burgers anywhere except at the Bistro - it's not just how the Bistro Burger is perfectly well-done or how the bacon on it is perfectly crispy or how the flavors of the cheese and onion blend perfectly with the juicy burger and bacon, but it's the entire experience at 3am in that dimly lit back room with a mug of beer, good (drunk) friends and that burger/french fry smell in the air
If I had to choose what I'd want for my last meal, it just might be a Bistro Burger those delicious fries
Great, no frills hamburgers and cheap beer
Don't ask what kind of cheese, or for toppings other than bacon - they don't have it
$ for $ this is the best place in the world
-- burger exceptional, staff top shelf, and a great juke box
would suggest going after 10 pm -- very crowded prior
great burgers and a wait staff that knows how to keep the beer flowing
if you are lucky you might even get to meet a very beautiful girl
Plainly: cheap, excellent meat, good bun, thick bacon, no crap ever!
Excellent burgers at great prices! Best time to go is sometime in the afternoon
At night it's always packed and you usually cannot get a seat, which is obviously confirms that their burgers are the best
it's cheap, it's fun, it's consistent great and simple food
high recommended
Bistro burger is the best in the city by far
Some times the wait in the crowded space can seem tiresome, but a few $2 Mc Sorley's Ales can help pass the time
All of your cares go out of the window once you do sit down
The service is prompt, and the burgers are top knotch
They even manage to cook yours perfectly to order
I recommend The Bistro Burger, a luscious but not overwhelming bacon cheese burger cooked medium rare
You'll need napkins for your chin, but a few of their equally outstanding french fries can help soak up the what ever's left on your chin!
The best, juiciest burget in town
You don't go here for atmosphere!!! But, it is worth going for a burger and fries! The burgers are awesome and filling too
For $10, you walk out so full! I can't wait to go back
You have to wait in line most of the time, but the burgers are worth it and the beer is cheap

As a long term resident of the Upper West Side, and one who is familiar with the paucity of good cuisine there, it took me years before I consented to eat at Ouest for fear of yet another disappointment
I was quite wrong in waiting so long
The service, atmosphere, and food have been excellent on repeat visits (I never order the same thing twice
with few exceptions
) They may just have the best appetizer in the entire city with their truffle souffle
The haute comfort-food thing may be a bit overdone, but I think this place does it quite well
Worthy of repeat business, and cheaper and easier to get a reservation in than similar restaurants in the city
Have spent the last five years learning about food and wine, and this was only the second time I've sent a plate back
Second try on the short ribs was barely better than the first
Also, wine was not the year on the list
Wife's striped bass was very good however, and the staff was properly attentive
Go to Cafe Gray for short ribs
Their staff is beautiful
Emily
the hostess on Tuesdays
just fabulous
knows her stuff
food there is succulent
the experience here is a ten, and then some
Thanks to the maitre de who is professional and courteous
The drinks and appetizers will satisfy to the point of best in city Top notch
I've been there twice in the past week and I both times were really wonderful
Both waiters were exceptionally well mannered and made us feel taken care of
I can vouch for the lamb carpaccio and the lobster appitizers, the rack of lamb, sea bass special, and the maple creme brulee
They were all exciting and delicious
I have tried other things like the ravioli appitizer and the chicken, but prefer the less basic things, because the others seem
basic
But even the simpler dishes are really good
I would just stay away from the endive salad
I know a lot of people who go for the $29 dollar price fix, which is good
but since you dont have a lot to choose from I would instead suggest getting two appitizers and splitting a destert if you are on a budget
I wish their $30-40 range of wine was better
Many reviews on here stated that the service was terrible
They say that the waitstaff and hostess were very rude
Well we went last night and everyone was pleasant
Maybe I caught them on an off night? I showed up 10 minutes late for my reservation and had them hold the table for an extra half hour because my date was late too
No one said anything
I had a drink at the bar and they held the table
Our waitress was informative and pleasant as well
The food is phenomenal but it does get a bit noisy as the night wears on
The bar upstairs has wonderful drinks as well
The food is good, the ambience pleasing, the location superb for Upper Westsiders, but the staff is obnoxious, making it hard to have a non-stressful dining experience here
Last time, we arrived promptly for our 5 pm reservation but stood in line because they did not open the dining room until 5:10
The greeting staff made a snide remark to a complaining diner
Our waiter was unpleasant
After our entrees arrived, we discovered he had told us about only one of the 4 specials of the day
Once I was scolded by a nasty reservationist because I said we were a party of five and a baby instead of a party of six
She admonished that every human body must be counted
Ouest should arrange group therapy to help resolve the staff's delusions and hostility issues, or better yet, hire some personable individuals who enjoy working with the public
Go and sit at the bar, chat with the winsome bartenders and have a glass of wine (they have some nice ones)
Graze on some appetizers, they have terrific calamari and a to-die-for truffled omelette souffle
I went with friends and we wound up dueling for the food
It's a fun place to hang out
That souffle is so so good
The decor was nice
We sat, two of us, in a large semi-circle booth - that was nice
The food was good
The desserts were great
The Martini's were large
There staff wasn't too personable
For the price - I would go somewhere else
If you come for the food, you won't be disappointed: It's delicious
Nothing too highbrow, but fresh and very tasty
And yes, pricey
Come for a special occasion, although the ambience doesn't scream special occasion
It's comfy, kind of like a very refined tavern with cool overhead lamps
:) After a fair amount of debate, we had the potato gnocchi, salmon gravlax, pork tenderloin and roast sturgeon, and it was all so good
Dessert was a pear crisp that was a tad sweet and could've used a tart component, but oh well
Our waitress was fine at first, but once it started getting busy, she seemed overwhelmed and didn't seem to realize we were there anymore
Nevertheless, if someone offered to take me here, I'd go again
The food is very good and the atmosphere is nice
However, I have been there five times and each and every time the attitude of the greeting staff gets worse and worse
WHo needs to start the night off that way? You get to the point where it is tought to enjoy the food
Oh Tom V!  Your restaurant is terrific; the cuisine is devine
The atmosphere is happenin; we had a great time
But the surly hostess could not have been more rude; Your restaurants are terrific and don't require such obnoxious attitude
We will go back, your cooking's first rate; Just tell the hostess that a nice welcome and a smile would be great!
We had been to Ouest before for brunch and were not disappointed, the prix fixe was generous and tasty
Only complaint, my omelette to order had one item incorrect
Dinner was a pleasant experience, we arrived early and had a drink at the bar and were promptly taken to our seats when the table was ready
One thing I noticed right away, lots and lots of grey heads
I had never seen so many old people assembled in a room before! Still the food was delicious and service quite good
Only complaints this time: the overzealous water waiter topped up our glasses with tap when we had a bottle of still chilling by the table and many items on the menu were not available (calamari, lobster tagliatelle, filet mignon, and etc)
If you make a reservation and want it honored, don't go west
I waited 55 minutes for my table on Friday with a rez
Some annoying hostess kept insisting it was a scew-up early in the night that delayed my 10pm reservation
Stay away from this dump
tom v's place was all anyone could ask for
superb service with wait staff who explained everything and injected accurate insight
the price is high, yet the food , service and excellence is priceless
our reservations were confirmed by long distance the day of our dinner and we were seated exactly on time
the maitre d' is a fool
he would not seat us because we arrived 15 minutes early and said if you made a reservation, why did you get here early? He let us be seated, but told the hostess to make sure we didn't get menus until it was our arrival time
The food is not special
It's not worth the insults
ok
not even close to the hype that is Ouest
bad service, fodd is to over the top, and the complex menu is messed up by the kitchen
For example my fois gras ravioli was a nightmare
Great salmon gravlax appetizer

Who would've thought that saag paneer (homemade cheese in creamy spinach) would make for such a wonderful pizza topping? You can't go wrong with tandoori lamb, lemon chutney or sprouted bean chaat
Onion rings, however, are disappointing
From the spiced doughnut holes to the dulce de leche "pop"--like an ice cream bar, but better--desserts are winners
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night
Great wine, great food
I don't like Indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy
Granted we were just the girls, but this would also be a great date spot b/c the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse, someone else's conversation
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas
They are amazing! The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry)
Service is spotty but on nice warm days your focus should be relaxing in the outdoor space, enjoying your drink and snacking on food as it comes out (the food never comes out all at once
go figure)
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner
Just stick with the small dishes!
This place is terrible! My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night, and were told we had to wait 15 minutes for a table
fine, except there were several tables open! When we sat down we ordered bread - for which bread bar charges $4 per piece of nan - but it took 25 minutes to arrive
About 3
5 minutes after the bread arrived, my boyfriend's beef entree lukewarm
My pizza finally arrived about 15 minutes after my boyfriend's dinner had arrived
His dinner was cold by the time he ate it, and my pizza was burned! Bread bar couldn't get anything right except water refills (good job to the water guy)
I'd stay away from this place unless you want poor service, burned / cold food and a hefty check considering what you get
The majority of what I read was VERY positive
However, a few negative reviews made me hesitant to go
I was only in NYC for one day and wanted to make dinner a great ending to the day before catching a flight out
We ended up going but not having a lot of time
We conveyed this to our servers
They were INCREDIBLY dedicated to getting us a great dinner and out the door
The food was fresh, dynamic and really popped (without being overwhelming)
We ended up eating at around 3:30 (off lunch menu) so prices were very good in addidion - 1 naan, 2 chutneys, one salad and a plate (pull lamb w potato pancakes) plus 2 drinks for around $60
It just wasn't good--the food was very bad Indian, and mediocre American at best, and the service left much to be desired
The bill was not so friendly either
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service
Food quality was excellent, service was good (could be a little more attentive
) Portions were moderate
enough
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal
Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor
The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here
On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar
We ordered a number of appetizers, mostly chutneys and naan, and they were all enjoyable (the tomato chutney was amazing) aside from one thing
by the time we were about to finish one dish, the next would be layed out on our table
Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites
Overall a worthwhile experience
This place has so much going for it - cool atmosphere, relaxed feel and good menu
Too bad the portions are frighteningly small and service iffy at best
The food itself was actually pretty good - fried oxtrail purses were the best
Ceviche was good but there were about 4 strips of fish
The lamb large plate had big bones, but little meat
Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks
Finally, the pacing of our meal was awful
Within 15 minutes of ordering, all of our plates had come out
We had to ask them to slow it down
It may be a Bar, but that doesn't mean you should feel like you're at a buffet
I'm not always easy to please, but my experience at the Bread Bar was very nice
As a walk-in party of two, we were seated immediately; the service was enthusiastic and attentive
The food was delivered quickly and actually staggered perfectly; allowing us to start but not finish our tapas sized dishes before the next one arrived
Bill loading? Nope
We were only charged for what we ordered and ate
As for the food, the coriander shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the Pumpkin rhoti was tender and delicious
Finally, the pulled lamb and mashed potato nanini, a sandwich served on crispy nan, was perfect
Beware of the overzealous bad reviews here
I have heard very few complaints about this place before visiting this site
Also, keep in mind that this is not formal dining, and probably not a best ever type of place, simply a very good restaurant/bar
First it took almost 30 minutes to get our appetizers
All the dinner courses came out at different times and the last one didn't arrive until 45 minutes later
The food was okay at best -- the Chicken Tikka was dry and the sauce was so bitter it was unedible
The portions were barely there so we ordered sides of rice that were dry and cold
The waitress was hardly apologetic that one of our party members received his entree so late
She offerred us dessert on the house, but when we ordered more than one, she only gave us one of the desserts on the house
It took forever for her to pick up the bill
No apologies from our waitress
I will never eat there again and I will tell others to avoid it as well
So not worth the huge bill at the end of the night
I love the Bread Bar at Tabla
It is fun, great food and very reasonable, especially versus the dining room
The greatest aspect is the outdoor cafe in the summer, which is one of the best outdoor dining spaces in NYC
Great food, great atmosphere, friendly but not necessarily prompt service but BEWARE they loaded our bill
I've had fabulous meals upstairs, so was excited to try the bread bar
Needless to say, I'd rather splurge upstairs than be so disappointed
The food was very average, although the prices would lead you to believe this food to be much better than your neighborhood Indian
They charge extra for condiments that are generally on the table (and you have to remember to ask for them), and the chicken tikka was so dry, I couldn't swallow it
Go elsewhere for Indian
The Scene Postcards of French starlets and vintage posters decorate the dining room, where locals engage in laid-back bistro activities: They read papers, nosh and talk, and watch old movies projected by the clubby wood bar
The enormous, partially-covered garden (with a portioned smoker's den) is more casual at night, when inside tables are draped with linen
Servers give good service when they're not spread too thin
The Food A
O
C's familiar French bistro menu offers all the classics
Stick to the Roquefort-endive salad or a simple cheese plate--though its selections are mainstream, it easily feeds four
Cheesy onion soup is thin-stocked, while too-chewy escargots taste off under butter-saturated breadcrumbs
Plump mussels with crisp frites are inundated with shredded onions
Among entrees, the pan-roasted sea bass with cauliflower mashed potatoes and seared, balsamic-drizzled tuna fare best
Juicy entrecote and hanger steaks often lack flavor; quiche can be dense and dry
I went to AOC with two friends on a monday evening
It was not crowded

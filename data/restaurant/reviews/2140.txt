The manager was no better
Very rude staff - how can you eat at a restaurant afer that? We went across the street to Park Bistro and had a really nice meal
I admit I first came here because of Bourdain's books, but it is not some bland tourist trap! Steak frites were wonderful, and I had an incredible tartes de pommes
Services is good, but it is very busy at night (reservations will be necessary)
I loved the un-stuffy atmosphere and the consistently great food
This is a great place to eat for consistently good, unpretentious French food
The service at Les Halles was possibly the worst I'd ever experienced, which was made even more awful by the fact that we were hosting friends from out of town
Even with a reservation, we were repeatedly told that it would just be another 10 minutes and had to wait 50 minutes before being seated - on a Tuesday night, hardly the busiest night of the week
It took 30 minutes to flag down a waiter and place our order and another 15 minutes to finally get water for our table
We were never able to get our water or drinks refreshed all evening
It also took us 25 minutes to finally get someone to clear our table and take our dessert order
The service was unbearably slow, inattentive, and rude as well
The food was decent but nowhere near good enough to make up for such a terrible experience
We were 30 minutes early for our reservation but they still sat immediately
Food was good (get a crepe or steak!) but slow to come out even though we were only 1 of 5 tables in the restaurant
Waiter was less than attentive and messed up our check but friendly
Perhaps it was just our waitress, however other reviewers have had a similar experience
There are too many tables for one server to wait on, therefore you typically wait 30 minutes before a drink order is even taken
The server was so busy the night we visited that she forgot to put in our food order
It took 1 1/2 hours!! We told three people prior to her coming to our table
Everyone else arriving atleast 30 minutes after us was half way through their meals
We ended up canceling the food
The manager replied It happens
I just went with a large group and we had to repeatedly beg our waiter to take our orders, bring us more wine, water, or anything else
After waiting more than one hour when we had a reservation, we finally sat
At the end of the night, the server told us that 20% had been added in but he would understood if we didn't live up to that
Service was less than stellar to say the least
For a $40 dinner, I sure wasn't satiated: I was still hungry afterwards
Dined with a friend who wisely chose the Steak Frittes dinner (good), while I had escargots and the duck confit, both of which were disappointing
The escargots came without their shells (canned?), though tasty, just too much butter and not enough garlic
The duck leg was OK, but pricey at $16
50 and so tiny that you need another one to fill you up
The tiny bits of fries were too well done and greasy
Service was negligible
Place was cramp and very noisy
You will eat French Food at Les Halles you cannot find elsewhere, and not only is it authentic but it is also good
The Best Steack Frites in New York, true, but also one of the only place where to find Pig's feet for the adventurous or a perdect boudin (blood sausage)
The kind of food French moms put on the table
Stopped buy for an early dinner on a whim and the place was thankfully near-empty
Possibly the best fries I have had in NY, 10/10
My Moroccan lamb sausages were cloying, while my gf's spicy snails seemed to do the job

Big fan of Cook's Tour and Kitchen Confidential
Made a res
but wasn't seated until 50 min later
Too small crowded to have an enjoyable bar experience
Too LOUD and cramped to enjoy part of dinner
Service was very good! Apoligetic hostess and good server
Charged for something I changed order on--hope I get it settled
You sit VERY close to everyone it's small
Still, the food was SO good and after some wine my Mom and I were able to shout a conversation
Locals are probably used to toucing strangers and blocking out others' conversations
I would recommend this place, but note that it is dark, crowded and loud
If this is OK, you will not be disapointed in the food
Watch your back--these servers are all over carying many dishes on their arms and I don't see how they do it! Overall, it was worth it!
Good Steaks and Frites, but the service is a bit off
We order and got our food, but the waiter never came back to check on us
This place is cramp, so be prepare to share your conversations with your neighboring table
I've been to Les Halles several times, and I just love it
Very casual and unpretensious with very simple straight forward but great food
The steak frites is my favorite
When I first visited Les Halles, this reviewer came away with glowing reviews
Since then I have had the opportunity to visit Peter Lugers and other landmark NYC steak houses
Having done so, Les Halles rates higher than ever before
The meal tonight was exemplary; the Flatiron steaks were deliciously tender and broiled to perfection, whilst the fries were delicious as per usual
Service was excellent with insightful wine recommendations
Best of all, the bill was at least half the price of the so-called true steak houses of Manhattan (and for that matter, Brooklyn)
I've been here many times and it has always been wonderful
The food is delicious, reasonably priced, and the service is attentive
However, I do not tend to go during peak times (late Fri
or Sat
nights), when you really cannot expect the best of anything
This is an authentic French bistro, is lively, and a meal here is a bargain compared to so many other French restaurants
Having studied in France and have taken a cooking class there, I'm very critical of so-called French restaurants
I had reservations for 8:00, but showed up 30 min early, and I was seated immediately
The tables are very close to each other, but it gives it more a European feel
The bread was very genuinely French and the wine list was good and affordable
I recommend the goat cheese potato salad
The frites that come with many meals are awesome
Visit this place if you like French food
In fairness to restaurant-goers, we must acknowledge that there are a lot of otherwise fine restaurants with an inexperienced hostess or that are understaffed, that cannot handle the busiest times (taking into account the significant number of harsh reviews)
I went early, 6:30 on a Saturday
Seating was no problem, cramped but acceptable
Steak au poivre, monk fish (a special), choucroute garnie, and tuna were all wonderful
Our waiter was charming and attentive, and the Leff Blonde on tap didn't hurt
Desserts were delicious but the chocolate thing is becoming pretty standard
Sorbets were home-made, a nice touch
I could smell that under pressure the model-hostess could have shown attitude, but fortunately we did not provoke her ire
We really enjoyed this place
I say, avoid the busiest times perhaps and make your cooking preferences clear to avoid mishaps
Total with drinks, tax and tip was 41 dollars/person
I don't understand people who go to the most popular place in town and then complain about the crowd or reservations running late
Granted there's no excuse for those who received absent service
While Les Halles certainly suffers from the cult following of its executive chef, the French bistro fare is memorable for its true to form flavors and fresh ingredients
The night I was there was a Friday night, it was packed with the tail end of the happy hour crowd and of course our party of seven was seated an hour late, but the waiter was very attentive and the food was served promptly and hot
Compared to some other prices you see around town, Les Halles is by no means pricey
I would definately go back for the tartare and muscles, albeit on a week night and after 8pm
Having been a fan of Tony's show and books, of course Les Halles was a destination for our 10-day stay in NYC
We got there around 1:30 today, the place had some folks, but many open tables
The food was A-, though perhaps not super-gourmet French by any means

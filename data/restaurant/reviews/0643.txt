The tuna au poivre was good as well
The wine list was somewhat skimpy, but the mixed drinks were good
Why did the wait staff keep filling our sparkling water glasses with tap water? Bartender staff was quite helpful
There is adequate bar space, so if you go a little early you can have some drinks
Kloe was recommended to me by a fabulous bartender at Il Tre Merli
She was right
this place is amazing
The beautiful interior reminds you of a warm craftsman in California
The service was terrific and the food was terrific
You must try the foie gras appetizer
everything we had was simply the best
I hope this place is around for a long time to come!
REASONS WHY TO MAKE A RESERVATION TODAY!!  FABULOUS FOOD- make sure to try the foie gras for an app, the duck and/or the rabbit as an entree, and the pumpkin dessert
absolutely blissful!  SPACE IS BEAUTIFUL--they've created an atmosphere that accomplishes the impossible; just enough space around the tables so that you are not dining with your neighbors, just enough music to enjoy but not to drown out dinner conversation AND just enough light to make everyone look beautiful! STAFF: great recommendations, very attentive
simply a pleasure!!!  ENJOY KLOE!!
An absolutely amazing new restaurant
Sublime food with equally sublime service and one of those very rare expert bartenders who actually takes great pride in the drinks he creates
Kloe stands out as one of the best new restaurants in NYC
After reading about Kloe in TONY I headed there with some friends
While it has only just opened, it wasn't busy which just meant we received the most attentive service I had received in some time, without being overbearing
Food was amazing and presentation spectacular
Great ambience, relaxed and warm with management eager to please!
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch
Ten TVs ensure pint-lovers won't miss a punt, while the 35 kinds of beer get sampled at the penny-bedecked bar or at booths covered in a red leaf-patterned fabric straight out of "Country Living
" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians
"
i go here at lunch sometimes - they have a great lunch special menu that includes a glass of wine or beer - whole meal for about $8
sometimes i go after work for a drink
the staff is super-friendly and the lights, oh the lights
so many christmas lights decorate the inside of the bar all year round, and that may sound cheesy, but instead it's lovely, warm and cozy
ONLY thing is, i wish they would change up the music sometimes - but other than that, great place
my son and i recently visited nyc for the first time
we ate at your restaurant 6 times
we stayed right down the street from you and i am so glad that we tried you out (since there is only a million pizza places in nyc) i have bragged about your pizza to everyone i know and highly recommend it to any tourist
the only downside is i can't get any pizza delivered to my hometown; i even thought about bringing some home on the plane
i cannot wait to go back to nyc and take that first bite of your pizza again
ooooh la la
thanks! kathy wright from tennessee
The Scene This stylish, golden-hued noodle house spiffs up a dull stretch of Sixth Avenue with a crowd ranging from Japanese visitors to NYU students taking advantage of full-flavored, sustaining soups at bargain prices
The Food It's easy to see why the menu touts the spicy miso menchanko as the house bestseller: a huge cast-iron bowl holds a delicious, sinus-clearing stock with ramen noodles, chicken, shrimp, fish ball, tofu, soy milk skin and vegetables
Another winner is the Hakata ramen, ultra thin noodles and pork slices in a broth that bursts with ginger flavor
Or, create your own menchanko by mixing and matching broth (soy, miso, sesame miso, spicy miso or tomato), noodle (thin, medium, thick ramen, udon or soba) and over 30 toppings from chicken to oysters to deep fried tofu
An unexpected surprise lies in the dessert menu--who would have thought a noodle house would turn out a panna cotta so light, or a caramel custard so creamy?
I have never eaten at Ony, so I can't attest to the atmosphere or the waitstaff
However, my friends and I just ordered 3 dishes for delivery (including two menchenko selections) and it was one of the worst food experiences I have had in Manhattan
One dish was so poor it was inedible
The food at Ony may be great for dine-in but don't get it delivered!
sake price is excellent, house sake is good
noodles are great! (sushi is not so great)  but to be very honest, a big reason my friends and i keep coming back here is because the wait staff is wonderful
Sweet, sweet people work there and make dining a pleasure
oh! and their seaweed salad
yummy
When you go there first time, try the Menchanko
Menchanko is noodle soup
My favorite is Sesami Miso Menchanko
I don't know about their Sushi but their noodle is Good
We thought it had MSG in it! But Ony, as clearly stated in their website, does not use any MSG
I had the spicy miso menchako and I was SO happy
the presentation was pretty, AND the food was delish! The prices were good but the place wasn't very big so definitely don't come in a huge group
The sushi was passable but not great
And the place is RIGHT by the W 4th St subway station
How convienient! I think Ony does carry out too- but not sure about delivery!
This place has very good noodles but the sushi is below average
One thing that is very good on the menu is the spring roll as an appetizer
definitely a better choice than the sushi which is below average
I really enjoyed Ony's mechanko
Alto its sushi isn't that great (my friend got it), after all this is a mechanko-specializing place
Not a great place for sushi lovers, but get that mechanko ;D
This place ROCKS
The food is delicious and very well priced for how good it, and the ambiance, are
For NYC, it's superduper inexpensive: think around $10-15/person for dinner w/out drinks
Beautiful setting--the only downfall is that the space would've felt cramped with the small tables so close
The best thing of all was the friendly, friendly, friendly and just-right attentive service
I eat out in the city a lot and it's always a joy to find such an inexpensive / delicious / comfortable place! I hope to be a regular
I always go there almost every week
My favorite noodle is Spicy Ishikari Nabe
hmmm so mouthwatering delicious
The service is also great and the staff are friendly
I highly recommend this place
this place in the west village has the best sushi i have ever tasted and this place has got me to like sushi
The noodles were excellent and the broth was so rich and creamy
A place to go to in NYC!!!
I love coming to this place and feasting on their delicious Ramen
My favorite is the Hakata Ramen with the creamy, flavorful broth
Hmmm
good
As much as I love this place, I would not recommend coming here for sushi
Their sushi is just so-so, but everything else is excellent including the service
There is a huge difference between a 7 to an 8 rating and a 10 means that you were blown away beyond expression in my book
Ony is a solid 7
We started our meal with some edamame (fresh, warm and lightly salted the way it should be), age tofu which was very good, but could of used some more sauce and the seared tuna appetizer was really good - great sauce
The sushi was fresh, nothing extraordinary, but very good and they add some nice sauces that compliments very well
The spicy miso menchenko noodles were dee-lish and served at just the right temperature
The waitstaff was very friendly although messed up a couple of the orders
The ambiance is clean, modern and laid back
With the overall good food, service and reasonable low price, I would definitely go back in a flash
We've been to Ony many times and each time we were satisfied
Its decor is modern and inviting
Ony serves fresh ramen in tasty broth, good sushi, and great appertizers
Try the bbq short-ribs, seared white tuna and sake

I went into the bar part of the restaurant to watch the game on the massive flat screen tv and as the night progressed, I ended up in one of the most fun parties I've beeen to in a long time
The crowd was diverse and unpretentious and the the hot, cool bartenders kept the crowd going by making great drinks
Even the music was cool
I had such a good time that I came back for dinner the next night and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was
I highly recommend the short ribs
Overall, I'm definitely putting Onieal's on my rotation
I love the Moulin Rouge martini, I keep coming back for more! The menu is a little short but always satisfying
There are great specials and even better soups
Plus, the waitresses all dress to impress
Good place to go any night of the week
Atmosphere was excellent
Cozy restaurant area with comfortable seating and friendly staff
Food was very good
Filet Mignon was very good and the appetizers and wine were just as good
Don't expect to be seated on time though, as the place is very busy with not a lot of seating area
Attractive staff and great food and service make this one of the best places in the area
Also a comfortable lounge/bar area is a nice place to hang out before or after a dinner in the area
I just got done having dinner at Onieal's Bar and Restaurant and had the best meal I've had in a long time
The service was on time and the waiter was very nice and personable
I highly recommend this restaurant
I have been going to Hop Lee since 1999
Prior to 9/11, we used to go routinely every three weeks after work, late at night
The food always came out hot, fresh, and fast
We used to order our food family style, as we used to go in there with 8 to 10 hungry people, and would pass the dishes around
However, after 9/11, things in Chinatown slowed down, and Hop Lee was not open at the times we were able to go anymore, after 11:00 PM
We still go in about once every six months now, and the place is still the same, and the food still comes out hot and fresh
There are about 30 or 40 police patches on the walls, in a display
I guess a lot of cops go there, and you know if cops go to a place, the food has to be good
The only thing that can be rough is finding parking once in a while
Otherwise, its a go for Hop Lee
I grew up eating at this restaurant
It's home away from home
The owner, waiters, and chef has remained the same and the food is away served hot, fast, and delicious
The owner is fluent in English, Chinese, and Spanish, so nothing will get by him
Friendly and no BS place
Food is authentic Chinese, no msg and price is inexpensive
You can't get a better deal in Chinatown!
The food is excellent and authentic Hong Kong/Southern China style dishes
Service is very quick and friendly, although the decoration is so-so
Price is low
The lunch special is $4
95, with one dish, one bowl of rice, and one bowl of soup
The soup does not have much MSG
I highly recommend this restaurant
I love bringing people here because the place is always busy and the food is always good
They make their basics well
My personal favorite is the house tofu dish- their tofu is completely homemade! the fish is usually good, and the noodle soups are comparable
The service is not very quick however, but the value makes it very worth it
Be careful while looking for it, its in an alleyway next to yummy noodles
I am really into good deals and cheap eats and this place in C-town is awesome
Don't expect good service or good ambience because you won't get it
But the food is great and the price is great
Chinatown is the best!!!
This is NY best kept secret in China town! YOu're in and out in 20 minutes, after a $3 roast duck better than anywhere else
!! You can'f get better than that
!
The Scene Dim sum in NYC's Chinatown can be something of a lively madhouse, and Jing Fong encourages its customers to get involved: Those too hungry to wait for cart service can hover by the kitchens to nab fresh treats as they emerge
As the afternoon progresses, you'll see as many waitstaff as customers scurrying after food carts with bill cards in hand, clutching stacks of steamers back to their tables
The Food The diverse assortment of dim sum fare is exceptionally tasty: The pork and vegetable egg rolls are crispy and generously stuffed, and every type of fried and steamed dumplings is available (veggie, pork, shrimp, egg, and fish combinations)--in addition to buffet-style raw seafood cooked to order
The culinary masterpieces, however, are the unassumingly tiny white mochi desserts: Their coconut-and-peanut-encrusted shells offer a crunchy contrast to their warm, sweet black sesame paste, oozing in your mouth like rich peanut-butter chews of the gods
Be there on a Saturday or Sunday at 1:30 - 2:00pm
Sit down and prepare to be satiated
This traditional dim sum parlor has everything but the lazy susans in the center of the tables
The food is fantastic
Shrimp dumpling, broccoli rabe in oyster sauce, almond dofu, sweet tofu and hot congee
They even have the more exotic shark fin dumplings but you have to request it
If you just can't wait for the lady with the cart to come around help yourself to steaming pans of authentic Chinese food a la carte
Don't snear when offered Worstechere Sauce, it's Hong Kong style dim sum
This is a fantastic place to spend a weekend afternoon
Don't expect refined service at a huge dim sum palace - expect a cultural experience
This is a fabulous way to spend a Sunday morning
Crowded - sure! The hustle-bustle is part of the reason to go!! But if you are here by 11 a
m
you will almost certainly be seated immediately
Delicious range of items from fresh seafood or pork dumplings to more exotic selections like snails and chicken feet
We never seem to spend more than $50 for four adults who leave stuffed and happy
Went here for my first NYC dim sum
Left satisfied--there is a pretty good decor in this huge, grandiose restaurant
The service was actually excellent, which wasn't expected
Not all of the dim sum was completely fresh, but all of it was good
My personal favorites were the potato dumplings, sweet pork and egg custard pies, and stiky rice
The jasmine green tea was pretty good too
Prices were typically easy on the wallet
I would definitely return to Jing Fong
the chandeliers are amazing and the cultural experience is lively!!! the food was fantastic!!! the waitstaff was very nice and the service was outstanding!!!
Used citysearch to find this and went here instead of our usual dimsum haunt
Was very pleased with the service -attentive staff
The food was good too
We went at 2:30 pm
so the dim sum service was slowing down but we still got freshly cooked items
I would say go earlier than 2 p
m
for the best experience
Relatively clean environment
Recommended
It has been awhile since NYC has a dim sum place like this one
I use to go to Silver Palace (closed) back in the day
The food was good and the service was great
The ladies pushing the carts was extremely helpful
On top of that, you can go up and get your own food

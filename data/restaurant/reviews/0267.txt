The Editorial review explains why New Yorkers know nothing about mexican food
Los Dos Molinos is a pleasant escape from the usual tex-mex fare that is unfortunately everywhere in the city
The margaritas must have something extra involved because they have left several of mis amigos ripped
The spice is nice
I would love to see what the editor finds hot, because this food is ferocious and tasty
Try something simple like a beef taco and you will feel the magic
You will end up paying up for the experience, but well worth it considering you will not have to have any more drinks for the night
Most westerners would appreciate Los Dos, and all who like the spice will love it
If you like it HOT!! Then Los Dos is the place for you
I had the #5 Chicken with the green chile sauce and I was in heaven but don't fret there are other dishes that are mild
Like the tacos or burros just ask the waiter about the dishes
The restaurant is NOT big enough for large groups and they don't take reservations so get there early
OH! and don't forget to try the margaritas they have like 8 different frozen flavors
This food was sent from heaven
What an amazing mixture of textures and flavor, and to top it off, the dessert called Sopapilla was unique
The owner was amazing with us customers and very exotic I must say
What about those Margaritas!! It was really worth the wait!
The best and the biggest margaritas around
Food was good - very spicy
I wouldnt go there on a first date but it's a fun place to go
A little overpriced (3 margarits, 2 dishes - $100)Young crowd, fun atmosphere and oh yeah, DID I MENTION THE MARGARITAS!!!!!!
There are plenty of better Mexican restaurants in the city
Avoid this one
Service was poor
The food is extremely spicy without having real flavor
I would not go back
Why? All their food is VERY HOT with NO Taste
I am from Deming, NM and know chile and theirs is garbage
Service was probably the worst ever, anywhere
I went in expecting a lil bit of spice and my food and I still was not prepared! The food is incredibly tasty, and if you like hot food this is your place!  Seated quickly, but the wait staff is a lil out there
Drinks are big, as well the should be
You will need them
Definitly the placed for a relaxed date, night out with some friends or family
Oh yeah gets crowded early!
LOS DOS MOLINOS TRUTH: Living in Phoenix, I have had the pleasure of eating at the original Los Dos
No contest: hands down the best Mexican food in the Valley, regarded as the place to go when you are done with watered down taco bell food that other places peddle
In New York during 8/02, I took a friend who is a native New Yorker to the other Los Dos, and after dinner he proclaimed That is now my favorite restaurant in the city
It isn't a matter of opinion, rather simple fact; Los Dos is the best in Phoenix and in Manhattan
If you are ready to try the real thing and thoroughly enjoy it, check out Los Dos Molinos
You'll be more than pleased
(unless that mongoloid reviewer from Nov
6 is there - then you should probably leave because he smells really bad
Really
)
There are two problems with Los Dos Molinos: (1) the food is much too spicy, and (2) the service is unacceptable
While I realize some Mexican food is spicy, Los Dos Molinos' entrees are so spicy that no flavor whatsoever can be detected, and everyone in your group will be sweating and lunging for the water pitcher all night
And good luck getting a refill on that pitcher -- the service is completely unacceptable
Slow is one thing, but not getting what you ask for is unconscionable
Our waitress forgot to bring me another margarita, but somehow she managed to get it on the bill
When called on it, instead of taking my word for it and apologizing, she had the nerve to count the glasses on the table to make sure I wasn't trying to pull a fast one
Two words: amateur hour
come here for the margarotas and the young crowds!! the food is mediocre
As a Texan and a big fan of Taos, NM, this place is a treasure to NYC; a New Mexico flair, not mexican
The food is spicey, but worth every bite! The margaritas remind me of home, BIG! We had difficulty finding someone to seat us, but the handsome owner jumped right up and found us a great table
It is crowded, but an easy way to meet new people with the close quarters
The wait staff was very prompt with all of our orders
I again thank the owner for being such a host
The decor has definitely go the Sante Fe/Taos appeal
I lived in Phoenix for a few years, and one of the only things I liked about that sprawling city was Los Dos Molinos
How happy I was when I moved back to NYC and found they had a location here
The food is authentic, the service (particularly at the bar) is good, and the margaritas are delicious
I know this is a small thing, but their soft corn tortillas are a welcome treat when most of the restaurants around here have tasteless ones or don't serve them at all
In Short The highlight of the sprawling space is the Rainbow Room itself, a stunning gold- and silver-draped ballroom situated around a slowly revolving dance floor
When couples take to the floor to the music of the 12-piece big band, the effect is magical
The menu features many pastas and steaks, as well as fancy classics like lobster Thermidor, vitello tonato and duckling a l'orange, and trendier favorites including fried calamari and tuna tartare
Shame on Cipriani for ruining this fantistic institution
The wait staff were rude and inattentive
Go to Top of the Rock for the view, then eat at the Sea Grill
The view was the best (65 floors up)
The service was very good, although the food was mediocre
Know you are paying the price for the view and the service, not the food
It was okay, just not anything special
I would go again if I was going there without a doubt as it is a romantic place to go in the early evening with the sun going down
First, we were ignored for 10 minutes after our drink order was taken, sitting with no water, no bread, and no regular order
Questions about the menu were taken as annyoing, and no second bar order was taken the entire time
When we finally got water refills the waiter sloshed ice and water all over the table and my friends salad twice without an acknowledgement
Food was standard, and when we said we had been ignored for over 15 minutes, the waiter said well, that's why I'm here now, no apology, no offer for free desert, nothing
The gorgeous view was completely overshadowed by the substandard service
I've had friendlier at fast food restaurants
Save your money and your good mood by not going -- you'd be better off going to the Empire State building and throwing $200 off the top
Went to RR first time for brunch
Service great, food awesome, view divine
Used to go to Plaza for brunch, but now that they've closed, I'll be going to RR
Spread at RR is not quite as comprehensive as the Plaza, but what they DID have was excellent
Service was miles above the Plaza's, with its lackadaisical waitstaff
Could be due to fact there is also a captain in charge of waitstaff
Captain makes sure you know who he is, as there is extra line on the bill to tip him as well! Due to multiple tip lines on bill, we got confused, and inadvertently tipped captain $45 for simply doing his job! This on top of waitstaff tip! We called RR after fact to explain confusion, and said we wanted $45 refunded
They gave us total runaround, kept telling us it would be handled
It never was
We made a reservation a month and a half using their Open Table reservation service
Confirmed with a credit card, chose the time, received confirmation, etc
We then planned our evening around the dinner
Three days before, and right before leaving for NYC, we received a call from the restaurant telling us that a private party had decided to extend their stay, and we had the option of dining later that night, or they would be happy to see us at a later date
We quickly cancelled our reservation
Reservations are for THEIR convenience, not yours!!!!
The restaurant had the feel of a passed era
The decor, the history, the food, the views, it was all there
The only thing missing was the service! I would think that if I was at THE Rainbow Room, I was going to enjoy every aspect of my dining experience, but that is just a theory, a bad one
The service was terrible, we (my partner and I) were not checked up on, we had to find someone to get us something to drink
It was a complete and utter disaster

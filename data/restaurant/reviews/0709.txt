Again, a place where you pay to eat around tragically hip 20-somethings
Oh, the fun
A group of 10 of us went last Saturday afternoon for brunch
It was very busy, especially in the front where tons of people seemed to be enjoying themselves in the nice weather outside or in the atrium, and our large party was seated right away
Our very friendly waitress took our drink orders immediately and helped us make some great choices
Our food was served quickly and the waitstaff was attentive and made sure we were all being taken care of
Almost everyone at the table ordered something different and EVERYTHING was delicious and tasty
We all had a great time and really enjoyed ourselves - we'll be back!
I went on friday night with two friends
As soon as i entered i was astonished by the vast range of decor that can be seen lining the walls os this restaurant
I was greeted by a wonderful hostess that seated us quickly
After ordering our food was brought to our table very quickly despite the huge crowd
The food met and exceeded all my expectations
This is the place to go if you are looking for a great ambiance and amaaaaazing food
Will definitely return
We had a really wonderful time at Agave this past Wednesday
It was a a full house and everything was great
The food was amazing and service was very good, no waiting and pleasant waiter
Try the mojitos
They're unbelievable! And the shortrib entree was outstanding
No wonder this place is so popular!
My girlfriend and I went the other night and had a fantastic time
The waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu
The food had a bunch of subtle flavors that mixed very well and the drinks were not only great, but the presentation and color was also very fun
I am definitely coming back
Four of us went on a weeknight
The place was noisy and busy, but we were seated quickly, served our drinks -- and then largely forgotten
Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it
We finally got the check the only way we could: we packed up and headed for the door
Presto! our waiter magically reappeared, just in the nick of time
The brunch menu is pretty good and a nice value
I wouldn't recommend going there for dinner though
Think twice about going to this restaurant! We made reservations; however, they didn't seat us until 1 hr later and then told us we only have one hour to eat
The manager was very rude and stuck up
Who cares about the food?????
How have I never been to Agave before? My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend
The food is phenominal!! Maybe it's because my friend is there a lot, but I was welcomed like a regular
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes--I was a bit put off that it was so crowded, but when I got my margarita, I knew why
And the bartender remembered my name!
The entrance isn't that inviting, especially in the winter months
You will be greeted by a smiling hostess which counters the lack of decor at the window seating
The main memory that keeps ringing a bell is that the service is awful
The servers and/or bus persons dart back and forth through the dining room, never even making eye contact to see if you have any needs
They don't offer recommendations, take a long time with drink orders, don't check back after serving the entree, and plan on waiting a long time for the check
Unfortunately, going to a place as hyped-up as this one is sometimes a set up for a big let down
That's exactly what happened to me
The food is a weird combination of styles, I wouldn't call it Mexican, perhaps not even Latin
The service was slow because the restaurant was crowded
It's also very loud and at our table in the middle of the floor we could hardly hear each other
I didn't drink much but I guess if you get lit perhaps you won't notice how unimpressive the whole experience is
But it is expensive, perhaps you'll notice that
This restaurant was very average! Food was OK, cocktails were crap!
We had to wait about a half hour before we were seated, even though we had reservations
It was worth the wait
The margaritas were tasty and the guacamole is recommended
I can't wait to go back again!
We went there based on a friend's recommendation
The staff there was very friendly and accommodating
We had reservation for 9:00 PM but the show got out a lot earlier and the staff was happy to accommodate our early arrival
The seating is a bit tight, so it is not a good place for private conversations
But if you don't mind the dinner crowd so much, it is a great place to go
The decor is very nice with the adobe and interesting bamboo ceiling
The food was excellent and prices are reasonable by NYC standard
We had a great time!
I go there often and I always bring new friends with me
Everyone always loves it
The food is flavorful and not too heavy
The ambiance is good enough for a date and just as nice for a group of friends
The waitstaff is helpful when choosing items on the menu
I'd definitely recommend it
My friends and I came to Agave for our monthly dinner
We had 8:30 reservations on a Wednesday
I called back to confirm the reservations hours ahead of time
I still took the hostess staff 30 minutes to find somewhere for us to sit
When we would be looking for the hostess, she would be busing tables
I think she was too overextended to provide a good hostess service
Once we got sitted everything was MUCH better
The margaritas were professionally made
The food was all very good
Especially the Angus Burger, a MOST try
In the end, the bill was $30 a person including drinks, tax, and tip
Not bad!
I arrived a few minutes early and was asked to wait at the bar where the bartender was more than gracious to attend to our needs
We were a large group and would highly recommend all the drinks and foodThe manager on duty was understanding that our friends were very late and held our reservation
The service was attentive and knowlegable
Ther food was amazing and filling
My friends took me out to this place for my birthday and it was so much fun
It was quite crowded and I can see why they made us wait till everyone was there as 3 of our group didn't show up and they then changed the table to (an even better) one
The whole time we were waiting the hostess kept talking to us, telling us we wouldn't lose our reservation, and even gave us free blue margarita shots! I'll be back!
This is a great place for a couple or small group, as they don't seat you until everyone has arrived
I wish they warned me when I made the reservation for 14 ppl
But the food was excellent, the service very attentive and the margarittas tasty
Will definitely be back but with a much smaller group
I had been there before for brunch and even with a reservation, I still had to wait and service was very slow
Overall my meal took 3
5 hours
Going back there for dinner, I thought it was a fluke before
Again, with a reservation, they still made our party wait 1
5 hours before even seating us
They don't have a formal reservation system like many restaurants, so be prepared to wait at least an hour plus

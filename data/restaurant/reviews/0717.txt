highly recommended
Waited to get into Prune
With little time left we wandered down street to Starfoods
What a wonderful surprise
Great atmosphere and friendly help on hand
Started with hot bisuits with honey and butter
I had pecan pancakes
Friend had the bbq pig sandwich
Both were fantastic
I'll definitely check it out for dinner
good french cooking and atmosphere
really cool staff
Came in at 3am and the place was rockin
Perfect late night menu and wines
Keep up the good work and keep playin White Stripes loud!
An affordable cafe with great food and service
About time
This neighborhood has been desperate for a great late-nite spot
Cool tunes, party atmosphere, and surprisingly super sweet service
Try the chicken and waffles and chocolate mousse
2 die 4
Keep up the good work Starfoods and welcome to the neighborhood
the best southern cooking i've had in new york
the biscuits are the best, y'all!! and the service takes me back home to birmingham, alabama
keep it up Starfoods
I love southern-fried, homestyle cooking, so the menu seemed apt soley because it had fried okra on it
The ole' fashioned food the restaurant boasts brings in a mix of punkrock-hipster-indie fashionista crowd
The simple food is bland in comparison to the people eating it
But it's just dying to be good, because if it were, this place would rock
I had to put salt on a lot just to givesome flavor
The food needs to punched up, spicier! The fried okra didn't have much taste, although it was breaded nicely
The chicken fried steak was super bland and a little tough
Go to Virgil's
The catfish was bland, too
The bread basket was the best: warm biscuits
The overpriced food that's supposed to come off as homestyle diner just doesn't work when the atmosphere is supposed to be super cool but the food is super bland
I loved the biscuits that they bring to you
And I loved the rabbit stew with grits
But the homemade peanut butter cookies made me homesick
This is a special place that makes you feel like your at home
Kudos Starfoods for a very sweet evening
I'll tell my friends
What a great place to hear music and eat
I'll definitely be back for the pecan pancakes! The best pancakes in New york, hands down
Great scene, better food, and outstanding service
Welcome to the neighborhood, Starfoods
Where ya been all my life?
Great music, great vibe and the best chicken fried steak in town
I love this place
Went for a friend's birthday and was totally won over by the gracious service and wonderful food
Tell all your friends
Starfoods rocks!!
I did not try any of the noodle dishes here as I was drawn towards the idea of cheap sushi
The menu boasts very cheap sushi with half price rolls and 50% off specials
However, any price comes with a cost and this place is cheap for a reason
The yellowtail sashimi was decent, but the rest of the sushi was not very fresh at all, fishy tasting, and bland
The spicy tuna rolls had mayo which is not uncommon but I found there was more mayo then fish in the roll and not very spicy
Moreover all the sushi we ate was served very warm
I am not sure how the rest of their food is but if you want sushi go somewhere else!
This place has beautiful sushi, and it's delicious CHEAP
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy
Best of all, Nan Joon really make you feel at home every time you come
The Rock-n-roll is a definite favorite! The entire neighborhood loves this place!!
Although they don't have the traditional Korean barbeque set up at the tables, the food is great
And even more so, the service is excellent
The people are really friendly and if you order take-out they offer some edamame while you wait
My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place in the freezing cold winter (9 degrees) because I was craving sushi
They let you bring in your own bottles and enjoy really really fresh sushi! The walls have cute marker drawings all over it and make the place feel even more friendly! Good choice (a bit expensive)
Dinner was fantastic! Decent wine list
Great Service
Tons of specials and a diverse menu
I'd been wanting to go to Brick for a long time, and it was totally worth it
It was a bit on the pricey side, but delicious
The Black and White Mousse cake dessert special is still calling my name!!
Every time I go to Brick whether it's for dinner or just for drinks I always have a good time! The service is great, and no matter what I order from the menu it's always delicious
If you want a place you can just go and chill, this is it
I've been here for dinner twice, the place has a great setting and ambiance
It's a good restaurant to go for a date
The food is pretty good, despite the above - average prices
They serve a little dish of olive pate once your seated - which I think is great
The service puts a damper on an otherwise enjoyable experience
The last time I took my girlfriend there, we saw our busboy more than we saw our waitress, even though it didn't appear to be very busy
She came to the table three times
to give us menus, take our order and give us the check
Needless to say, she didn't make us feel very welcome
I was really excited when I found this place shortly after moving to Astoria because it seemed like it would be a touch of Manhattan in dull Queens
The atmosphere is cute and cozy, with outdoor seating
Ambience-wise, it's a good place for a romantic evening or a quiet dinner with a friend
But I was underwhelmed with the dinner I had there once, and the 2 brunches Ive had since confirmed that the food is just not great
Their french toast is nothing specialslightly better than a dolled up version of Aunt Jemima
An omelet I had was ok, but the bacon was simply disgustingit was fatty, scary looking, and tasted just awful
The prices are not good either (e
g
, $4 for a small glass of orange juice!) Service is ok, albeit not terribly warm
Overall, Id say try 718 on Ditmars instead--now that is a phenomenal place
We stumbled onto this place after we moved to Astoria
My husband and I go there on 'date' nights and even my teenage stepdaughters love the place
The food is above par and the ambience is so cozy
The bar next door gets hoppin, too
This is probably one of the only places to get a true brunch in Astoria

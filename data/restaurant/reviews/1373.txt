No one at the table cared for the food
Everyone went to Piano Bar afterwards and got some nachos buffalo wings, which was a much better value
I am enraged about my experience with Thor's reservation
I called a week ahead for reservation with a large group
Had to take a prix-fixe and a min spending of $1,000 -- fine
I was supposed to get an email with the menu (didnt get it)
When I call to confirm, I got blown off and passed around several times for several days
No one had any clue
YOU FIGURE THE ESTABLISHMENT WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND PROCESS
Finally got hold of someone 2 days prior and was told theres no record of the reservation and a change in policy
To take a reservation, I needed to meet $3,000 min! I tried to rectify the situation, but they wont compromise
Found and booked another place at the last minute, plus reorganize the entire event
DARN RIGHT I'M TAKING MY MONEY ELSEWHERE; BETTER THAN TO GIVE THOSE IDIOTS BUSINESS
I'd almost given up on the LES after a slew of horrible meals (Stanton Social, Kitchens Cocktails) so THOR was a pleasant surprise
The space was unique (even though looking out the skylight windows on a tenament was a bit odd) and the service, happily, was fine
We opted for a bunch of small plates and were pleased by all of our choices
The Hamachi and Avocado salad was simple and fresh
The black spaghetti with squid was delicious
And definitely save room for the Snickers dessert
It is worth the hype
Overall, THOR is worth a repeat visit
The service was top notch when we walked in we were greated with such enthusiasm I really thought they may have mistaken us for celeberitys
That alone made the experience worth while
The fodd presentation was out of this world
The complimentary soup in the shot glasses was a nice added touch
I definitely agree that the salmon lasgna was delicious
Although the portions were small everything was very rich and I filled up quickly
I will definitely return
Everyone keeps speaking about this new restaurant Thor
So I figured I would finally go and try it out
Starting off with an excellent bottle of a spanish red (forget the name, but damn good) suggested by their wine expert, we soon ordered a few appetizers
I personally ordered the hamachi and I must say that was excellent
Fresh, light and tasteful
If there is one dish you have, try the salmon lasagna!! OMG!! Melts in your mouth
The scallops were also great
If you love chocolate like me definitely have the Snicker Bar for dessert
Overall the experience was great
Great food, great wine, great atmosphere (was loud and happening, not for the intimate experience)
I will definitely be going back for the salmon lasagna ;)
small plates are great for sharing, great if you like to try many different items at dinner
the price could add up if you are really hungry but the food is delicious, and has lovely presentation
Also wines by the glass are very affordable
I just went to Thor this Friday w/o reading reviews, and dn't understand the lukewarm comments
I went with my bf and thought food, decor and service were very good
We ordered 1/2 bottle of Gruner, 2 appetizers - foie gras and oysters, 2 entrees - steak and diver scallops, and 1 dessert, the pastry chef's favorite a mixture of crushed avocado, salt glazed caramel and lime sorbet (which really tasted like margarita infused guacamole, to try only if you're feeling wd-50 adventurous) for around $100
Admittingly, my appetizer and entree, the oysters and scallops were smaller portions, but the oysters were thoughtful, topped with tuna and caviar
The steak was excellent and at $23 a steal
Finally, to comment on the lighting/spacing I think this had to do thematically with the restaurant's name Thor
I don't think Thor was the god of intimacy
Our large group was seated promptly on a Sat
night
Service was friendly and knowledgeable
The menu was eclectic and varied from raw tuna to monkfish to duck, and all of the dishes we sampled were excellent
The only complaint was the size of the portions
Despite our 3 course meal, I still left hungry
Desserts were visually inventive but lacking in flavor
Snickers dessert with chocolate sorbet was the best, but even this didn't satisfy my chocolate craving
Scattered tables and booths throughout the dining room appear cold and lacking in warmth and an aesthetic design
The adjacent lounge area is more romantic and dimly lit and heats up throughout the night and is a fun place to grab a drink after (or before) dinner
Also check out the bar area on the 2nd Floor
If you enjoy ordering a tasty drink at an interesting bar while flirting and discussing intellectual topics, then this is quite simply not the place for you
It looks deceiving from the outside, with glass windows touching the street, fancy couches, trendy leather chairs, and a sea of well-dressed patrons - but don't be fooled! The drinks are so awful that you will find your expected experience shattered once you realize that you've paid $10+ for bad sour mix
Skip this place
Go next door to Verlaine, where the drinks are fantastic, or Inoteca, where you can enjoy tasty cheese platters and smooth wines
Leave the bad experience at Thor for unfortunates who just don't know better
Babycakes' cupcakes are delicious
One of the best things about Babycakes is that you can linger in house while you savor your treat
Rather than herd you outside, the staff welcomes you to sit in a sunny windowseat and flip through a Hatje Cantz book
Try the lemonade sweetened with agave nectar
The sweets are expensive because the high quality ingredients, like agave nectar, are expensive
The girls that work there are very nice
The setting couldn't be more adorable
But the cupcakes are perhaps the worst of the higher-end bakeries in the city
Unless you're craving wheat and gluten-free desserts, it's hardly worth the time, and especially the money
(almost twice the price of regular cupcakes
)
The chocolate chip cookies are DELICIOUS
I also tried the carrot cupcake and the vanilla cupcake
The cupcakes themselves are wonderful; the vanilla icing had a bit of a different taste than I was expecting (but then again, I'm not a vegan), but my boyfriend loved it
Absolutely worth the walk!!!
Went to Babycakes while in NYC for the weekend and was thrilled to have so many tasty GF options
Even my non-GF husband liked them!! They are a little pricey, but definitely worth it
We got 1 chocolate cupcake, 1 carrotcake cupcake, a banana chocolate bread, and an apple crumb cake slice
The apple crumb was my least favorite (kind of bland) but the banana chocolate bread was FABULOUS as were the cupcakes
GREAT GF option!! And they are starting mail/internet order service soon! Also, the items with spelt were clearly labeled and they verified with the manager when I asked, so there were no worries that I was getting something not truly GF
Ok, I'm a huge sweeteater
I've done the rounds, Magnolia, Cupcake Cafe, Billy's, but I LOVE this place
I don't feel gross after I eat the sweets, which is what I'm accustomed to
And for being a healthy treat, these goods are DELICIOUS!!  The cupcakes win my vote for best baked goods
Ugly but delicious
I was visiting NYC earlier this week and HAD to check this place out
It's VERY cute and they had a pretty good selection of vegan sweets
I tried a chocolate cupcake - VERY GOOD Banana Chocolate loaf cake - EXCELLENT Chocolate Chip cookies - As good as any other cookie I have ever had!
I have been there and have tried the chocolate cake that is labeled gluten-free (made with garbanzo and fava been flour) and had no problem
I thought it was wonderful and am so happy that I made my way downtown for it
The frosting was amazing
(P
S
they list things that are made with spelt flour and are very helpful)
The chocolate cookies are amazing

The wait staff was practically bumping into each other in the dining room and it was difficult to tell who was our server
We were served our appetizer before the bottle of wine even reached the table, let alone was poured - and was served our dessert several minutes before our coffee
I would have expected better from Daniel Boulud
I've had lunch here several times - I've always been seated promptly (without a reservation!)
Every meal has been quite good and the waitstaff very friendly
The communal table is lots of fun and a great way to meet people
I could gripe about the prices but I never leave feeling unsatisfied! Definitely worth checking out
After reading some of the negative comments on Citysearch about DB, I wanted to try it out and see for myself
I was pleasantly suprised
While a bit cramped, service was attentive and pleasant
The appetizers were well done and our main courses ($30 burger and Crispy Duck) were absolutely wonderful
I have to be honest I was not sure what to expect from the burger, especially since I knew it was not going to be your typical hamburger, but it was very tasty and done exactly as ordered
Rather pricey, meager portions
but the food was delicious
If one more person asked me to check my coat, agh
On a cold day avoid sitting close to the entrance
If you don't mind $5 for a cup of tea and you're wealthy go for it
We went there on Valentine's Day
We got a nice table by the window, but were a little cramped
The wait staff is very nice, but we were rushed out in about an hour AND on Valentine's Day! The food was o
k
My veal was a little too chewy
This place turned me off to french food and I will never go back or recommend it to anyway
This is a place I wouldn't eat at too often, but once in a rare while is amazing
The lobster bisque is like nothing I've ever had
It's spicy (not hot, just spicy), creamy and light and rich at the same time
The hamburger is quite decadent
The maple pot de creme was light and delicious
The wine list had several amazing wines from which to choose
The service was quick and efficient
Not worth the trip to Times Square / Theater District
Very poorly designed, crowded tables, strange layout
Unattentive service, useless service
Poor food
Rather overpriced
Bad crowd
I have never felt so ripped off
The burger that they rave about is nothing but a hype
Definitely not up to expectations
I would not have even paid $5 for it
Each ingredient they use may be of good quality, but as one dish it does not combine well, therefore the overall taste is really not unified
So not good
This is absolutely for people who want to spend money for nothing
Distasteful moderne decor
Need to hire someone less tacky
I'm embarrased I even went there, and I would never admit to my friends that I actually tried their burger
I may lose friends
Whacko Bistro worth a visit, but beware the clueless models and actresses waiting tables at this chic Eurodisney experience
My reservation requested a private table
The perfectly attired young hostess led us through the empty room to sit right in the main line of traffic from the front door
We wanted to try the much hyped Boulud-burger, but there are 2
The $29 with truffles, the other with truffles for $50
Think anyone knows the difference? Finally one clean-shaven underwear model was summoned: The Whopper comes with 10 ounces of truffles --- Huh? Sounded like an end-of-season 90%-off sale, so we ordered the $50 Royale
Conclusion: Zoolander shouldn't be asked to memorize complicated lines like the truffle mass
For that, you hire unemployed actresses
The burger is OK, but neither the 10 grams of truffles nor the flavorless foie gras add to the dish
Go casual, it's not bad
Tried the burger-not bad, but not great
It was mediocre
The burger didn't taste beefy nor juicy enough for me
The salmon carpaccio was too oily and lemoney
It killed the taste of salmon
The monk fish that they had as a special was nothing special, in fact, too much salt
Took away the sweetness of the fish right out of the dish
For this price, not even worth it
If it were a cheaper bistro(less 50% cost), it's food is bearable
Wine I orderd had junk on the bottom-means the bottle wasn't kept well
Service was excellent
We felt the waiter and captain rushed us through our meal
The burger ($29
50) was fair
They charged $17
50 for two cokes and three refills, $11
00 for an order of 5-6 puffed fries
I do not mind paying for good food but this was a rip-off
Came here on a Friday night around 9pm w/o a reservation and got right in
The sourdough bread they brought to our table was divine, however, my duck and wild mushroom entree was just ok - not as flavorful as the same dish at Balthazar
Chocolate sorbet dessert was just ok too - they don't have too great of a selection on the dessert menu which was disappointing
But I have to say, my friend's burger looked like a piece of art and he loved it
Service was relaxed but good and overall aesthetic was impressive
I'd definitely go back to try something else
I loved every minuet of it
Great location, great food, great martini and I just HAD to try that outrageous burger
It is a must, for the gourmet burger eater! This is a wonderful pre-theater dining spot, the best around right now in my book!
Had a very good dinner before theatre (great menu)
The beef was excellent and the martini's are HUGE
The staff was friendly and mello
A cool, modern interior and also has a great location for Theatre
Overall a very good experience
After being at Gotham bar grill the night before, this was truly a let down
I'm surprised our concierge recommended it
The menu was confusing, the food bland boring
(Not unlike DB's other restaurants) I could've found better food at the refreshment stand at the theater
I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews for this place
We had a wonderful experience at this new Times Square bistro, except for the rude uncooperative and obnoxious maitre d'
Upon arrival he made us wait for 15 minutes while he had plenty of tables open
He even reprimanded some of the staff in front of us which we thought it was very unprofessional
After we were finally seated the joy begun
The food, the service and the ambiance were superb
We had an exquisite lobster bisque and the famous tomato tatin

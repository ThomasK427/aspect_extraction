I had the lamb shank, which was highly recommended, and found it bland as could be
Others had quesadillas, sliced steak, and chicken with mushrooms (is that even mexican food??) and they felt the same way as I did
On top of that, we felt beyond ripped off with the cost of this meal ($60/per person)
The service, however, was excellent, but definitely not enough to make up for the poor food and skyhigh price
Bottom line - go somewhere else
Wow, the service was very snotty
from the maitre'd to the waiters
The food was expensive, and did I say that the service was snotty?
This place is always packed with a young, good looking crowd (especially the bar)
The cuisine is more of an authentic Mexican rather than the Tex-Mex that we Americans are so used to
The guacamole is made at your table and you can ask the guy who makes it to tailor it to your taste
Unfamiliar with true Mexican cuisine, I tried the Huilachoche (which wasn't bad), and the cactus pads (interesting)
The sangria was nice just like our hostess who tried to accomodated us as best as she could
There was a wait for tables and then we were sat near the bar which IS LOUD and CROWDED so it was hard to hear my dinner companions
Pricey, but then again, it's the Upper East Side
Bring your credit cards!
Great experience
I would recommend start with a serving of guacamole (maybe the best in NYC) and good 'tequila con sangrita'
Great for groups
I went with other 4 people and we had a great time, not very loud (of course this depends on the day of the week and the time), excellent service, and the price
a little bit expensive
but considering that this is the best Mexican Restaurant in town it is totally understandable ($50 for drinks, guacamole, entree, dessert, coffee, tip and tax)
If you are looking to have a good Mexican dinner for a low price I would recommend another restaurant
if you are looking for the best Mexican dinner and a place to impress
I would totally recommend this or its sister restaurant in Lincoln Center
Great if you have no taste buds
Food is over priced and the coriander is overdone in all of their dishes- I guess they haven't heard of other spices
The guacamole tasted chunky green mud
However, the decor was interesting, the service was pleasant, and although the margaritas were pricey, they were delicious
I searched this site for the best Mexcian restaurants in New York and decided that Rosa Mexicano had the best authentic Mexican food
I went to dinner there last night and was very happy to find that the food was as delicious as the other reviews stated
I was even happier to find that the service was nothing like I read
I couldn't have found better service at my Mom's kitchen, and my Mom's service is exceptional
The atmosphere was relaxed and the wait staff was very attentive and helpful with recommending some items on the menu
The food is a bit pricey and I wouldn't go there every day, but next time I feel like real authentic Mexcian
Rosa's will be the first place I look
GREAT food, and great Sangaria
The service sucked though
Would definitely go back, but not when I have any kind of time limit
As a Mexican living in the New York area, I have a hobby of trying Mexican restaurants in the city, searching for authentic food
So far, I 've found that Rosa Mexicano is the best restaurant serving authentic Mexican food
From the guacamole, to the tortillas, to the entrees, drinks, and desert, it's excellent
Sure, the hostess can be rude, but when in the mood for authentic Mexican food, there is no better place in NYC, yet
As for the hostess, if you're going be put off by a rude person in NYC, you're in the wrong city
I am half Mexican and this restaurant is a tribute to what REAL mexican food tastes like
Not Taco Bell, Not Taco Express
People worried about the $$ PUUHLEASE!! It is absolutely worth it
The tableside Guacamole alone is definitely one of the best I have tasted
The classic Mole Poblano
superb! Maybe some of the Negative comments came from people who were expecting cheap tacos
not Authentic Comida
This is by far the most overrated restaurant in New York
I has just closed a deal and took some very important clients to dinners
One client, was lactose intolerant, and requested that the cheese be left off the top of her dish
Well, despite the fact that this would only involve not drizzling cheese on top, the chef, who has clearly confused himself with a Le Cirque chef, said it would look ugly and refused! Are we tring to satisfy our guests or ourselves! Ugh, save yourself the trip and head to Maya instead
p
s
the food was way overrated as well
You have to try their guacamole
It is the best I've tasted and it is worth every penny! Great place for group outings too
This place is awful
Went here on Wednesday at 6pm
Not only did the hostess give us (only 6 not 30 people) the dirtiest look when we walked in, there was no one there and they refused to sit us
Then they said in 10 minutes we would have a table so we decided to go to the almost invisible bar area
The bartender was telling us the seats we sat in at the bar were taken
Of course I questioned it since there were no indications that we were in someone's seats
But instead of taking our drink order, he started to pick a fight with a friend of mine
Then the manager came over and told us that there are no tables available for us
I refuse to go back here, even if some say that the food is great
We dine her with my boyfriend whenever we feel like eating Mexican
It is the best Mexican in the city
Pk, it is pricey but I think it is worth every penny
Hey, I've noticed this restaurant for a while,, really pretty
BUt after walking into the restaurant, I was even more impressed with the interior
REally pretty, really romantic
Best of all, its great food for great value
I went there on Valentine's day and they don't charge the customers with all that over priced menu and stuff
Will return again
Started with the guacamole and it was good, but *fourteen dollars* worth of good? The famed pomegranate margaritas were tasteless
My meal arrived cold so my wife very politely asked to have it heated up
As I was waiting and waiting for my dish, the waiter stopped by to say it would be arriving very, very hot, said in a condescending way, like you wanted it hot, well you're gonna get it hot
Several minutes later it arrives (my wife had long ago finished her dish) and he says again it's very, very hot
Same tone
Well, I lost it
He said he would go get the manager and five minutes later the manager insisted on buying us coffee and desert (ten more minutes)
An awful experience
Go to some of the real authentic Mexican restaurants in Brooklyn and Queens, eat better, and save $100 in the process
I have eaten there several times
The guacamole made fresh at your table is exquisite and the mole sauce is heavenly
Don't miss it!!
Even if you think that you don't like Mexican, you must give Rosa Mexicano a try
Unlike any other Mexican restaurant i've been to
The guacomole is made to order at your table while you wait for your entree
The frozen margaritas are out of this world
The menu is very extensive and the prices are very reasonable
My husband is Mexican, and he just loves the place! We always take friends and relatives there for a real treat
Upscale Mexican food - in an authentic setting
I thought the entir experience was a 10
Guacomole was great we ordered it hot spicy We loved it with Sangria
The entres wee great

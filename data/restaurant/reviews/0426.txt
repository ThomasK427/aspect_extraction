And to all you cheeseheads out there, youve gotta check out their cheese card
Everything was really great
Theyve also remodeled the garden, and well, youve gotta see it to believe it
Incredible outdoor space
The wine list continues to be strong and the service always a bit eclectic but always good humored and kind
This place is a keeper
We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday, and it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in NYC
The food was extremely bland and lacked salt; the tables in the garden were too close together so I was elbowed in the head repeatedly by the woman sitting behind me
But, as a wine lover, it was the wine that made this my worst dining experience ever
We ordered 4 different wines (by the glass) and all of them smelled and tasted disgusting -- they probably kept the bottles open too long
This is the first time I've returned a wine
They give the champagne birthday drinks at the end of the meal, but since I got sick from the bad wines, we had to leave before dessert and before we got the drinks
Overall, I will never go back here
Definitely not worth $140 for two
I love Paradou and go as often as I can get my friends to join me
The food and wine are fantastic, and the garden is very cute - a bit crowded, but that is part of the charm
I held a birthday party here for a large group in the garden, and we were very well taken care of and had a fantastic time
Everyone keeps asking when I am going to plan another party there
I also love their larger sister restaurant, Partage, in the village - they have fun events like regional tasting menus and wine tastings
Each time I've dined here has been a very good experience
The garden is really enjoyable, the food is good to very good, and the service is always right on
And while all that would be enough to keep me happily coming back, the lovely selection of wines makes my return inevitable
Just came back from France and was eager to try this restaurant my friends said I would love
They were right! While in France, I missed the excitement of New York city life
When I returned I also felt as though I left a piece of me back in France
Paradou brings the two together in such a magnificent way that this is now my ultimate dining experience! Upon entering, we took a seat at the bar which was made of french wine boxes
had a delicious bottle of ponte cannnet pauillac, then to the garden for dinner which were of generous portions (unlike most french restaurants) and tasted just like when I was in France
Listening to the sounds from the speakers reminded me that the night was young in nyc and this was the perfect neighborhood to have some fun
The only smile we saw all evening was from the host at the bar who directed us to the garden, which was beautiful
Everything else about the night just kept getting worse
Our waiter was stuffed with attitude and didn't bother explaining things on the menu that he clearly knew we could not understand
The food was miserable- the kobe beef with peppercorns was an embarrasment to the cow and was laid in a bed of about 70 whole pepercorns
The grouper was tasteless and chewey
We were deeply dissapointed and were going to go elsewhere for desert, then decided that they couldn't possible mess up crepes
We were wrong
Our crepe was tough and we had to use knives to cut through it and the bananas were overripe to the point of being black
Rude service, terrible food and a stiff bill to top it all off
This is the worst restaurant I have ever, ever been to
We were seated in the loud, crowded noisy garden that sounded and reeked of a frat party, only with trendier people
The waiter took at least 20 minutes to show up, setting us up for an evening of slow, inattentive service
The food? Worse than the service
Beets were like plastic
My crepe was a cold store-bought tortilla folded over chewy asparagus drowned in goo
Utterly inedible
My boyfriend, who can eat anything, stopped eating after two bites
We left unsatisfied and angry
This place is horrendous
Get a bottle of Beaujolais in the backyard with a friend - a little oasis in the Meat Packing District
I work in the meat packing district and was delighted when I found Paradou
Great ambiance, welcoming staff, and delicious food
Don't miss the awesome garden
Definitely check out their second restaurant Partage
Over priced--nothing on the menu warrented the cost
The most average place that i've spent a lot of money at in a long time
Even worse, i haven't felt so unwelcome at a New York restaurant in forever
The meatpacking district has created a real cold, expensive exterio, and this place only adds to it
The place is small, yet very cosi and with very good music, which creates a great ambience
The heated back-yard is a plus in the winter
Seating was quick, only a 5 minute wait and we were there
Unfortunately the rest of the night was a long wait: for the menu, for the wine, for the appetizers to arrive and a ridiculous 45 min wait for the entrees
The food was just ok, I would have liked thicker and more flavorful sauces
As the meatpacking loses more of its charm with the influx of large and uber-of themoment places, Paradou remains an oasis
I love comingto this place year round and have seen it change from a small wine bar serving crepes and panini to a full service restaurant serving kobe steak, cassoulet and amazing scallops
The wine list, in my opinion is one of the best French lists in the city
The reserve wines are great values and tremendous finds
The staff is always cool, the owners fun, and of course the garden is one of the most magical places in NYC
Im very happy to see Paradou stay true to itself and not just another overdone, overpriced place in the Meatpacking
For a place recommended for wine and cheese -- this was just sad! First, the wine is poorly stored -- 2 different glasses we tried were spoiled just by having been open too long
It's also grossly overpriced and the wine buyer is clueless - bad quality where much better is available
The only thing worse was the cheese
We were told their were 5 cheese on the plate, but no one in the place had a clue of what they were
Then, they were served straight out of the fridge (rock solid brie, camembert, and a very bad goat cheese)
Just a quick note to say how fantastic is Paradou
I had dinner with friends in their back garden area and had a very good time: the food was excellent, the staff very knowledgeable, and a great overall atmosphere
We'll be back soon!!!
Great, tiny spot
Good wine, although pricey
Food could be slightly better-- the cheese is good, however the charcuterie could be better
The outside dining is great
The ceiling is covered with leaves
Good wooden tables add flavor to the place
Attentive waitstaff
General good feel
Go early because it fills up fast
I finally had a chance to try Paradou and was impressed from the moment I sat down
The garden, which must seat at least 80 people, is great
It's an open air setting that forces you to forget you live in NYC
After being awed by the atmosphere, I was more impressed by the food
First, it lived up to its reputation and second, it offered a large menu variety
For appetizer, I had the goat cheese terrine and for main course, their summer special: the shrimp brochettes
Both were outstanding
Now, here I am enjoying a great garden with great food and what really threw me over the edge was the cool music
Can't wait to go back
Ive been a long time fan of Paradou, but have always foundtheir brunch offerings lacking
No more
Went there this past weekend with 3 friends
Sant in their garden and had the most sublime French Toast
Superlight brioche, with a fresh strawberry compote and fresh whipped cream
Mmmm good
My friends also enjoyed their poached eggs with smoked salmon and what was a very unique dish of eggs poached in red wine with mushrooms and bacon

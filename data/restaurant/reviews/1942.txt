They even threw in an additional 2 entree choices! Our entrees were cooked to perfection
Yes, the service was harried the decor could be updated
For the high regular prices, people deserve to eat in a more elegant sophisticated restaurant
The banquettes felt like I was sitting on someone's very old, comfy, over stuffed sofa
Yes, the decor is from a 1986 time warp
But it is not dingy at all, instead it is somewhat kitschy and inviting
This is much more friendly than most serious food/wine joints
The wine list is incredibly strong, full of treasures and fairly priced
If you take wine seriously, it is like being a kid in a candy store
Importantly, the quality and prepartion of the food has risen to an extra-ordinary level
The food is not showy, or pretentious (even when it has truffles,caviar
), rather it is well-executed and delicious
Went on Monday and had such a wonderful meal that I returned two days later and the staff created an entirely different, equally good meal
Food was really good, but the place is really cramped, waiters are harried
Chanterelle isn't that far away
Nice wine list and nice bar
Food is better than average
The four of us had dinner at Montrachet (it was highly recommended by a friend) for the first time and right at the start - the Asian Host (I would not even qualify him by calling him a Maitre'D) had a an snobby attitude
The service was slow, the portions were miniscule (not even small) and the overall ambiance was stuffy
When we first walked in, we saw other diners wiping their plates with bread- so we though that the food was good -but we very soon realized that the portions really were so small that you really have to lick your plate clean - afterall, their dinners costs a fortune
Truly disappointed - will not go there again
P
S
to the Asian Host - Learn to speak proper French
The salads are good, as were the chicken and risotto- the deserts are a disappontment- particularly the creme brulee which is overburned
As for service, the waiters try hard and mostly get it somewhat right, but do seem a bit confused at times
The food and wine here are both truly divine
The $90 tasting menu, however, is a complete rip-off
You pay for practically four full-size portions, but they see fit to serve only 1/3 of the a la carte order size
The lamb was one bony piece (2 oz) from a rack of lamb
Some rack! I would say it was delicious, but there was barely anything to taste
One more gripe - the service could definitely use some work
Our server didn't have the sommelier stop by when we were trying to decide on wines, he never brought the bread we requested and didn't crack a smile the whole evening until he saw that I was paying the tab when he suddenly became nicer
i went expecting a great meal
as a vegetarian i was given boiled vegetables
very disappointing
too expensive as well
on a pre fixe meal we had to pay for coffee and additional money for some dishes
one is not accepting these charges on a fixed prepaid menue
tasteless boiled food not worth the price
We relocated from Chicago a little over a year ago, and love to eat out
This is the first high end restaurant that we have been to in New York, that we would take out of town guests to
Our expectations were fairly high, and they were all surpassed
The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was the best
The wine pairing concept was great
Also, to find a place that offers half bottles of wine is wonderful
What more can you say
Came here for lunch and couldn't have been more impressed
I took my girlfriend to L'Ecole for Valentine's Day, and we could not have had a better dining experience
The food was incredible, our waitress was top notch (she even offered to take a picture of us without asking), the atmosphere was great, and I dare you find a better value
I highly recommend you give this place a try, just be sure to call ahead
Lecole literally means school in French and they are doing and excellent job training the next generation of chefs
The food was great, nice selection of wines but the service was ok
The menu changes seasonally and the prix fix menu is a good deal
I loved dining here for lunch
The selection was good, the presentation divine, the ambiance beautiful, the waitstaff cordial, and the food- delicious
All the food is cooked by senior students at the French Culinary Institute, and I have to admit that I'm very impressed
For lunch and dinner, do try to get the prix fixe, it will save you money
The desserts are also quite good
The portions are not large and the tastes may be odd to one not accustomed to french food or gourmet creations, so be careful about who you bring
And make sure you make reservations well beforehand- they're almost always packed
This is the place to introduce your friends to really good French food without the heavy French restaurant ambiance
Definitely consider the wine pairing as well
The service is all students which I think adds a nice touch
I'll be back
This is by far my favorite restaurant
Everything I have ever eaten on this menu has been great
The menu is creative and I am never disappointed
Plus $30 for a 5 course meal is a great bargin
I love this restaurant
I would highly recommend it
what a great treat! delicious food and attentive, gracious service
love love the short ribs and the vegetable terrine is out of this world!!
FCI's definitely commited to quality service and outstanding food experience
Classic French dining experience and unforgetable atmosphere is not suprising, knowing the legends involved - Jacques Pepin, Andre Soltner, Alain Sailhac (who came over and spoke to me during my first dining experience) and Jacques Torres
excellent, what a great deal! multi course lunches that are outstanding! and the chefs are always sending thing out (at no extra cost), that aren't on the menu
The staff is excellent, you want for nothing here! they also can direct you the right wine for your meal
overall, i've never had an experience like the day i visited Lecole
be there at the right time and you might have the chance to meet chef pepin, or jaques torres
In a town where there seems to be a French restaurant around every corner, this is a really great deal
Best prix fixe meal in the city for $30(!)
We went there with some friends for my birthday and had a great time
As long as you don't expect Jean Georges, you won't be disappointed
I had a completely different experience than the other person who posted
L'Ecole treated me and my date like a king and queen
They were attentive, the food was excellent, they answered all of our questions about the cuisine nicely, the ambience is romantic, and they let us linger and talk as long as we wanted
The place was packed, too
Although the food is a tad expensive, it's a nice treat
Plus, the man at the door told us when we left that if they were ever booked, to ask for him specifically, and he would fit us in
I mean, what more can you ask for?
The service was terrible
We were rushed to order, and then 70% of the today special was not available
After we ordered, some other waiter/manager (not the one that served us first) came over, asking for us to order again
They failed to refill our water
Food was OK, not the greatest, dont know why got such a rave review
Soon after dessert, the waiter/manager (same one again!) came by and just dropped the bill on our table without we asked for it
So after we paid, 2 of the girls had to use the rest room
The rest of us waited and chatted by the table, and after about 5 minutes, same waiter/manager asked us to leave and to wait outside
That was so rude
Not sure why coz I don't see anyone waiting for tables

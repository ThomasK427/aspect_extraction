Ive been in Argentina many times and there are not many Argentinean Rests
as good as this one in New York
The Bife de Chorizo and the Entrana are out of this world
I hope the prices dont go up as it becomes famous
The wines are incredible
They even have the HENRY LAGARDE RESERVA wines that are difficult to find in NYC
Try the Malbec or the Cabernet Sauvignon, they are probably the best value you can find
simple is more,Excelent meat ,cook to perfection
great energy and super wines
The food is very tasty and the meat so tender
It is better than dinning at grandmother's
Try the Dulce de Leche crepes and you will fall in love with Buenos Aires in New York City
I had been in Buenos Aires with some of my french friends this week
We enjoyed a wonderfull dinner at Buenos Aires
The filet mignon was incredible and the Pollo al Champignon as well
The caramel crepes and flan were supreme
I recomend Diablo del Uco Merlot wine  We will be back at this Fantastic argentinean restaurant
Go to Buenos Aires and Bon apetit
Buenos Aires in the East Village is a miracle
You do not need to travel for have an authentic argentinean steak
Just go to 6th Street between A and B in NYC
The decor is really very argentinean style, the food and the wines as well
The best steak y had in NYC was the shell steak i had in Buenos Aires
The empanadas are delicious
Do not forget to try argentinean Malbec The best !!!!!  Great food, great service and great price!!!!!!
I lived in Buenos Aires Argentina for 10 years
Now i found an authentic argentinean food in New York City
I recomend the ribe eye, just delicious and the caramel panqueque is to die
The argentinean wines exellent
The service was veryt friendly and profesional
No cuestion about
Try this place is just Wonderfull and you do not have to pay anymore an overprice steak in NYC
Buenos Aires is an authentic argentinean restaurant style and the prices are so inexopensive as in Buenos Aires Argentina
Last weekend I had the most wonderfull dinner at Buenos Aires
The best steak in New York City
I recomend this restaurant
The food is so tasty and inexpensive
The service, the atmosphere and the price are wonderfull!!!!!!!! What a surprise Donatella Versace was there having dinner
This is what we need a great restaurant in New York City
I have become addicted to this place
The food is just like the NEW YORK POST describes it to die for!,for me this is it
The place is always full even though they know me the owner sticks to the credo first come first serve on weekends
To those who wrote bad reviews its quite obviously the competition
The ground rules in America is FREE MARKET''
And Karina (OWNER)sticks to her ethics
I have been in Argentina many times because of my work and this is better than Cabana Las Lilas
I dont think that Donatella Versace or J
J
Campanella who are frequent patrons go to Pampa or La Portena
But ill let you decide!
I found this restaurant on Citysearch
I took my boyfriend since he loves to have a great meat dinner
I don't eat red meat but I found a tremendous amount of options for me as well
The salads are AMAZING-light, lemony dressing
I had the grilled calamari over argula
YUM
We had the Mozzarella, Caprese empanadas-wonderful
For my entree, I had the grilled salmon which was cooked perfectly
My b-friend had the shell steak which he loved and a chicken soup which was great as well
The wine was wonderful
we had a chardonnay from Argentina that was awesome
BUT lastly, we had the truffled chocolate ice cream dessert
WOW amazing! If you are looking for a unique dining experience in a relaxes atmosphere, Buenos Aires is the place for you!
Buenos Aires was wonderful, the food was great I had the Entrana with home made frenchfries and a beef empanada as an appitizer
Even though we had to wait 30 mins for a table it was worth the wait
We had no problems with the host he suggested we go to the Kion Lounge
If only the check would come prematurely like my entree I could have get out and be soothed by the peaceful sounds of the fire engine blaring down Ave A
This place is too loud
My ears are still ringing
Service is not better
The waiter had an unpleasant attitude
When I asked about the ingredientes of the chicken soup I was told it's just chicken soup
While we were still having our appetizers, our entrees were brought in
Tables are tiny
If the waiting staff could be bothered to clear away non-essential items there would be room for the food
The food? What I tried (morcilla and entrana) was quite good and the chimichurri is well balanced
However, good Argentine food can be found in quieter places with more professional service like Pampa and La Portena
Overall, not recommended
The best argentinean restaurant in NYC, Excellent Service and exquisite wines at inexpensive price
I'll be back for sure
Nice and cozy restaurant with a warm, welcoming athmosphere; my steak was incredibly good and incredibly cheap
My friends loved their food too
I will definitely return
My family and I had and exelent dinner at Buenos Aires
The service was so good and friendly
The food delicious and inexpensive
The steak perfect and tasty, the caramel panquequeto die and the wine exellent  Thanks Buenos Aires, we will come back soon
WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!  I went in skeptical, came out a believer
Yes! There is such a thing as a 14 dollar steak!!!! And the best steak in town, too! Try the empanada
Yesterday, that was a boring pie for me, today empanada=slice of heaven
I want to go back to go down the entire list
The entrana was something I didn't think possible
AMAZING!!!!!
East 6th Street is no longer just Indian; it is now a trendy street stretching further east with a number of interesting new restaurants
The food here was great and the prices are very reasonable
The service is not great, but very friendly
They forgot part of our order, but apologized and we were not upset
As with all Argentine restaurants, don't go if you don't like red meat
The Reds from Mendoza, Argentina are very good and a great value
Especially the the bodegos in the higher altitudes of The Ucco Valley (about 3,000 feet)

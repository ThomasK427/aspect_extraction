It was so great to walk into a restaurant and expect to just have a meal and walk out in a great mood
The music was upbeat and put us in the mood to go out
The atmosphere was hip but not intimidating
Overall, the service and host made sure that we felt appreciated and the food was delicious
We will definitely be back
I went to the Eatery this weekend after being out of town for almost a year
They are still doing things perfectly! It's still the best place to have great food at decent prices
It's fun and trendy
but still has a warm neighborhood feel to it
I could live on the Asian Chicken Salad
and I just may because they deliver
Bravo
Decided to try this place out last Friday due to a number of positive reviews
There were definitely some pluses and minues during our dinner, unfortunately the food was one of the minuses
The service was very friendly and efficient, however, the food was only a slight step above a diner
We had Adobo Salad, Seared Tuna and Chicken Breast and they were all bland and lacking flavor
On the other hand the wine list is very reasonable with great selections for under $30 a bottle
Eatery for myself and my party, was all about waiting
We waited so long before we decided to try the place and when we got in we proceeded to wait 45 min to be sat down for Sunday brunch
By the time we ordered, we had waited another 45 min before our food was finally served
Never during this period was the staff courteous, welcoming, or amiable
Our waitress and hostess were both super stuck up
They didn't come to check for our water and failed to answer our questions as we had ordered
The restaurant itself is well put together, with a trendy and chic decor
The food thankfully (or maybe its because we were hungry) was delicious but needed bigger portions
The prices aren't bad, but they aren't fantastic either
We went for Sunday brunch - menu looked pretty good
but we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated
Not unheard of for NYC, but there was one, then 2, and then even THREE tables that sat open during the 40 minute wait
When we finally did get seated, the service was excellent and prompt
However, the strawberry pecan waffle I ordered became too hardened to enjoy before I finished half of it
Stick with an omelette if you're picky about waffles like myself
Also, beware this is a NOISY brunch place, and I sensed a quasi-velvet rope attitude from the host
If you do go here, be patient and not too picky
Eatery has been around for a while, and continues to deliver
Seating is always quick and the service is always good
Outside seating in the summer really isn't worth it, and takes too long to get a table
The pulled pork sandwich on brioche is to DIE for
I didn't think it was possible to serve a heart-attack in sandwich form, but Eatery finds a way
They don't always have it on the menu, though
The Sake Martinis are also heavenly, but take it easy on them
ouch
Lunch is always very crowded around 1:00p, and dinner can get pretty crazy too
A definite recommend
I like the vibe and the food is decent
I can't help but feel like it is a knock-off of another restaurant on 8th Avenue, but not quite as tasty
best dessert around especially the pistaccio ice cream
baked macorroni was dilicioso
Seating next to the window was excepional for viewing the horse and carriage moving down 9th avenue
I went to the Eatery with an open mind
The sidewalk dining was nice, except that it is on a busy corner
I got baked macaroni and cheese be/c it is something unusual, and it was great
My date had red snapper over avacado and endive salad, which made for a great presentation
I must suggest the cranberry-apple martini, FABULOUS!! It has floating cranberries and mint leaves
Prices were reasonable for NYC
Wait staff was attentive but not pushy
Overall, it was a good time
I lunched at the Eatery for the first time yesterday and I decided to bring my fiancee back tonight for dinner and boy was it a MISTAKE!! Nobody came to our table to take our order and we ask them to take our orde
During the whole meal, nobody checked to make sure that everything was okay
We sat at our table with our dishes already cleared and NOBODY came to ask us if we wanted dessert or our check
We eventually had to ask a busboy for our check As we were leaving, we heard the couple next to us asking their waitress why where their food was and the waitress was very RUDE
I thought this place could have been a place where I would become a regular customer however I will never go back and will not tell anyone I know to go as well
Wonderful place for brunch/lunch in theater district
Heads and sholdiers over most of the rest
At first the staff came off a little snobbish but the attitude flew by as fast as the wait staff
Excellent service, that customized my meal and surpirisingly let us leasurely enjoy a long brunch
I enjoyed the ambiance and loved the food
Although the homefried potatoes were not worth the plate space, next time I'll ask to substitute a nice salad
Overall good vibe and I'll go back
Briefly, Here a couple times a week, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT MANAGEMENT, GREAT OWNERS, AND CUTE BARTENDER --- HI LAURA! Seriously, one of the nicest, most accomodating management staff in the city
This is why the restaurant is as successful as it is
Others could learn a lot
I will definitely be back! The dcor was clean and simple, and the food was fantastic
Our waiter was very engaging and accommodating
Great burger and sweet potato fries, even the garlic pickles that came on the side of the burger had a notable, distinctive flavor, as did the chipotle meatloaf
The margarita was one of the better ones Ive had in the city
We arrived a little before 6 so we were seated immediately, but the place was packed by the time we left
I just loved everything about this place!
the music, atmosphere, staff, food and drinks are great
this place is put together well and makes your dining experience very enjoyable
like everyone else, i always eat out and am sick of the same old bad service
check it out for yourself
very reasonably priced
a great deal for the $
If stranded on a desert island
I would ask for the Eatery's Asian Chicken Salad
The best of everything!!! I have been going to Eatery for years and am never disappointed
Not only are the food and drinks excellent but the staff is warm and welcoming
They know your face
they know your name
they know how to make a meal into a dining experience
Went to eatery with my family based on reviews I read on citysearch
The reviews were right on the money! The food and service had us making a reservation for next week before we left the restaurant
You can not go wrong at this place
We told the manager how happy we were with our experience at eatery and he suggested that we share our opinion on citysearch
Thanks for a great time and see you next week!!
Although, the food isn't to-die-for, this place has some very good offerings (skip the Mac and Jack as tempting as it may sound)
The soups and salads are great, as are the drinks and desserts
I live in HK and E is the place to be
Cool, sassy and sexy staff drop off hot and creative dishes, with smooth drinks from the candlelit bar

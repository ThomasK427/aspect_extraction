Fantastic service, food, ambience
Another great NY dining experience! We'll definitely be back
the food and service was wonderfull
they have a great prix fixe menu that changes weekly
last week was a pleasure eating in their outdoor garden
I was staying in the hotel next door
Needless to say I ate there the first time out of convenience
Was I a lucky guy! The sushi was very fresh
The pieces were good size
I had several of their noodle dishes as well
There is plenty to choose from for the non-sushi crowd
If they would just ban smoking in the resturant, it would be perfect
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing
Serving Japanese/French fusion cuisine, the food is a far cry from your typical sushi combos
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!) The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you
I had a really great meal here a few weeks ago, fresh sushi with delicious sauce, the Super Tiger roll was fantastic-, the lamb chop-yum! Drinks-Sassy Rosy martini-best of it's kind I've ever had
Desserts-Banana Foster-yes, they're that good, so is the fried ice cream and green tea creme brulee! Go! It's great!
Is a romantic place too with the seating at the window with NY city skylines
The seats are limited and in high demand
In Short From the powder blue storefront and neo-'60s sign to the green grass foyer tiles and shelving against gallery white walls, this 650-square-foot boutique isn't your father's candy store
There's not an additive, emulsifier or $8 grande anything to be found
Local espresso, coffee and tea--from Gimme Coffee in Ithica and Serendipitea in Long Island City--are reasonably priced
The big ticket is a box of 48 Jacques Torres' truffles, and chocolates have a three week shelf life
This is always my first stop in New York City
I need my chocolate fix
All of the servers know their chocolate and have made some excellent suggestions
I also have to have their chocolate at home so I use their website
I have never had a problem with delivery
Wish they could open a store in Houston (I'd live at their store)
Hands down- the best chocolate in New York was chomped by yours truly in New York's Chocolate Bar
Where can you go in this crazy world to buy a piece of chocolate not served in a heart-shaped box?! I'm not giving you the business when I say that I found myself doing the cha cha when I ate that round disc of marshmallow and caramel
Standing behind none other than Susan Sarandon who called it the Paul Frank of Chocolate
Cute, but not quite right
This place is has soul
Its a rock n roll creation and the chocolate with the skull cross bones simply kills
Walk don't run
It's worth the walk
This store was Great! The chocolate is soooo good but the staff is not snoty at all
They greated me when i walked in and answered any questions i had
Its small and seating is limited but i enjoyed sitting at the small bar watching people go buy
I had several bars and was not disappointed with anything i had
I recommend the ice chocolate
Its so rich!
Totally weak
Not nearly as good as billed
Too much hype
Haven't we had enough of places like this?
Hot hot chocolate
Chocolate-covered pretzel's
Coconut Cream Pie in a chocolate bar
Save CBGB Chocolates! The hits just keep coming
Went to CHOCOATE BAR yesterday for the first time after reading the New York Times Style Section story and wanted to see it for myself
Wow! Big ideas from such a cozy spot
This is the kind of store that makes New York special
The owner Alison Nelson was such a wonderful host-- I didn't want to leave
The music was modern
The staff was young and hip, the packaging was perfect and the chocolate was delicious
Someone please remind me why we have 5 million Starbucks and only 1 Chocolate Bar???????
tried their liquid hot chocolate after hearing how different it was
was definitely very different, more chocolately and creamy
had the caramel liquid chocolate, was very sweet but i liked it
very different from starbucks hot chocolate
this place doesn't use powder
would definitely recommend to frens
place has limited seating so first come first serve
didn't get a chance to try their gourmet chocolate but will be back to try
Great candy, the chocolate is so good, well worth a trip
Almost fainted at Chocolate Bar when in the span of two minutes walked Leonardo DiCaprio, Mike Myers and Julianne Moore
Wow! Talk about pre-Oscar gitters
Oh, the chocolate is out of this world! Count me in as a regular
God I love New York
Where else are you going to find a self-proclaimed Candy store for Grown-ups? The cities richest, creamiest chocolates mixed with the best hot coco I have ever tasted
Had to write a review as I was in yesterday and sat next to David Lee Roth! How hot is that! Even Van Halen likes to partake! Can't wait to go back and try the Elvis a bananana marshmallow thingamajiggy with graham crackers and dark chocolate
Man, I've died and gone to chocolate bar
The chocolate is delicious but get it to go
The restaurant is stylish and modern, but tiny
Also it's a bit pricey, so not for the every day, but worth the occasional special trip
Also the chocolates make a great gift
Had a very good experience with the Chocolate Bar
Had a very welcoming vibe, not pretentious
Completely addicted to the Peanut Butter Chocolate cookie and hot chocolate with a shot of espresso
I admit it
I'm addicted to Chocolate
Always have been, always will be
Fact is, bury me with a box and I'll die with a smile on my face
I've read the reviews, walked the streets and sampled the others stores such as Jacque Torres, Marie Belle and Vogues and I just had to write cause I felt inclinded to let you know that Chocolate Bar is simply the best in New York
Hands down
Bar none
Cream of the crop
The top dog
The confections are creamy, the hot cocoa dreamy and the staff the friendliest I've encountered at any chocolate store
This is simply the best spot for your chocolate fix
A few reviewers have posted negative comments about the chocolate
I happent to really like their hot chocolate (and I believe it is made by Jacques Torres)
If you are prefer the powder stuff or the barely drinkable stuff at Starbucks, this might not be good for you
they use real chocolate and milk
Try for yourself
it is perfect on a cold day
The chocolates are good enough, but not as inventive in flavours as Vosges nor the late El Eden
The coffee is top notch, however

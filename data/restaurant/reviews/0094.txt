The wait staff doesn't really take much of an interest in you and doesn't seem to care about their customers
They seem to think they're too good for their jobs
Sometimes I've feel like not leaving a tip I got so annoyed
In addition, there is no one at the entrance to seat you
Expect to stand around for a while before one of the waiters desides that they can be bothered to actually get you to a seat
Like I said, the food is great though, with low prices, so I put up with the aggrivation
If the service was as good as the food, this place would be one of the best around
Decided to travel out of Manhattan on the recommendation of a friend
Planet Thailand is totally worth the 3 subway stops on the L train from Union Sq
The Pad Thai was great, the peanut sauce was awesome and the sushi was good too
The space is very industrial and modern, who would know a place like this exists in Bklyn
Dinner for the two of us, I had soup, she had a sushi roll, then we split chicken satay, had pad thai, and basil chicken
The check was $28
00 TOTALLY WORTH IT, I will definitely go back
The food is wonderful ! I have been to several parties there and had a ball
Planet Thailand is a fun place where anyone would love to go
Well worth the trip
This place is a lot of fun! Great to go with a group of people! Food is good, environment is trendy, but again a lot of fun
First time I was ever in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and I got to say there is alot going on over there on the other side of the bridge! Some very cool spots, but reminds me too much of Alphabet city which I am not a big fan of
but MAN you will ignore it while you're chowing down on good hibachi and sushi! We ate a ton of food and didn't even HAVE any Thai food yet
The prices will shock you, they are so low
Depending on where you live, it may take you a minute to find it, but VISIT THIS RESTAURANT
I can't stress it enough
Very good cheap food
No frills chinese food type paper menu
Huge space, many people
Be careful with the waiting list- the hostess skipped over our party on the list as we sat waiting for a table, for over an hour
Then apologized and told us we were next
Then she sat 2 or 3 other tables ahead of us before scurrying to make us a setting
But the food is so cheap and quick that we got over it
Very good $7 martinis at the bar to occupy your wait time
Well planned, planet thai
Now could someone please buy them a microphone???
If you're looking for great prices, good atmosphere and food to match, this is your place
I came here with a Williamsburg friend of mine and the two of us were amazed once we walked through the door
Unique decor, good service and the shrimp pad thai was very good
I added this to my list of must gos with city newcomers
Planet Thai is my favorite place to take first-time Williamsburg visitors
The teeny tiny price tag and substantial portions are sure to make any starving artist happy
The Chicken Pad Thai (available in X-tra spicey) is the best I've had in all New York and is a mere $6
95 for a whopping portion
Also be sure to try the papaya salad and the sweet and sour calamari
A word of advice though: the service BITES! Your food will never come out at the same time as your friend's and you're guaranteed a bit of attitude from the server no matter how pleasant you are
Truth be told though
the food is worth the attitude
I love planet thailand
THe food is great and the prices are very reasonable
You should try the chicken or vegetable pad thai (mild) its delicious and their california rolls are awsome
You might even want to start with a calamari appetizer
Planet Thailand, located in Williamsburg is just like restaurants in the meat-packing district, a little cool, a little edgy yet out of it's element in a somewhat desolate locale
The variety of food is extensive, prices are great (trust me, can't beat the prices for this type of restaurant) and there is zero snob factor! The decor is grungy/arsty something between artsy/modern and downright underground
I really like the place
The food is great! Try Pad Thai
The best! Very cheap for this kind of food quality
if that's what you're after, then looking no further than Planet, which not merely went downhill after it moved from its humble original space on Bedford Ave, but became a monstrous magnet for unoriginal Billburg tourists looking for sustanence between bar hopping
The food is merely OK, not especially well priced, and the crowd is simply absurd
The space is artsy, but in the sold out way that made you start hating your favorite sell-out band
This resturant set in Williamsburg fits it's part
Very artsy/friendly and the decor is fun
Makes you feel like you're in an old loft or garage which for Williamsburg, makes you feel at home
The food is great and you get large portions of each item you order
I recommend to start off at the bar with a long island iced-tea while you wait to be seated
Proceed to order Tatsutage, Spring Rolls, Shumai, California Rolls and House Salad with Miso Soup (not for just one person of course), for the apetizer
For the main course, try out the Beef Negimaki
hmmm hmmm good
I could eat at Planet Thai daily and recommend it to everyone
This is one restaurant I would never go back to dine
If they offered a free meal I would easily refuse
The wait staff was beyond rude
The attitude was not only unattentive but even smung
With many places to choose from in New York, I would walk two hours to avoid this place
I've been coming this place for awhile and there are no complains
I've taken my friends and they love it
Great food and great vibe in the heart of Willamsburg
They only one thing I have to warn you about
they take no reservations
Please come with patience
While you wait, the bar is filled with great and cheap drinks
enjoy
Definitely check it out
The food and wait staff at Planet Thailand is an A but what's up with the hostesses? Rude, Rude and more Rude
I think it's a pre-req to be one
It's definitely worth a visist once you get past the gate
The food is great and the price is extremely reasonable
In Brief Befitting its Theater District locale, the 5,000-square-foot dining room has a dramatic motif with rich woods, wine cabinets and hand-blown glass perched on a backlit display
Tables are comfortably spaced, while the soaring columns offer a bit of privacy
The menu offers pan-seared seafood, roasted chicken, steak frites and a variety of pastas
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style
Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people
However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100
With the food lacking in flavor and the service lacking in
service, one would be overpaying for the experience and for the food
This place is pretty deceiving
it's a gorgeous place in a great location and wonderful ambiance
Service was on par but not wonderful
My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor
It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food

The strawberry cheesecake was also a disappointment
It was pre-cut and the texture of the strawberry was firm, like it had been sitting in the fridge
Nonetheless, we are looking forward to the next time for more pizza and the great service
Maybe it was an off night
Next time, we'll try downstairs
My husband and I went there on our 2nd wedding aniversary
We tried downstairs where a Jazz band played
However, the ceiling was low and the air was bad
We returned upstairs and asked to sit at a table near a window previously occupied, but he lied and said the people sitting there would return
They already left! The waiter didn't want us to sit near the window
Eventually another waiter cleaned up the table and allowed us to sit there
However, he was also very UNFRIENDLY and RUDE to us, yet he treated other customers with respect
He also went outside to smoke while he was serving us, and came back smelling like cigarettes
He didn't even say farewell when we left
Terrible service!!! The iced tea I ordered was watery and old
We will NEVER return to that restaurant!!!
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality)
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
I am in love with this place
The pizza is delicious and now that the garden is open, it's one of the best places to go for a date or with a friend to talk
The martini list is incredible--the banana creme pie and chocolate cake martinis are to die-for
We've had the same server each time we went and he's very good at recommending drinks and dessert
I would definitely recommend La Lanterna!
best pizza in the city fantastic bruschetta open late top-notch, friendly service excellent desserts
I went over for a midnight panini and was pleasantly surprised
Good food and attentive service
Can't wait for the backyard garden to re-open
Great late night option
I've only been here late nights so I haven't really tasted anything but their desserts, but I highly recommend this place just for the atmosphere alone
In the winter they have the fireplaces working which immediately creates a cozy romantic feel
I prefer the downstairs because it's bigger and there are a few couches if you're lucky to snag one
Great place to take a date
It's usually packed on weekend nights but somehow I never really had to wait that long for a table
Highly recommend it
My boyfriend and I loved this restaurant so much that we went back again the next night
The ambience is extremely romantic, even if you get seated upstairs
The margherita pizza is delicious
The next night we tried the quattro formaggio but the gorgonzola was way too over-powering
The salads are great, the martini list is huge (mm i tried the creamy chocolate martini) and the tiramisu was a perfect ending to an amazing dinner
I highly recommend this restaurant!!!
In the last week end I visited twice this great restaurant-pizzeria with my girlfriend
Both nights we really enjoyed their salads and great pizza, let me tell you for an italian it's not easy to find a pizza here in America that we would describe superb such as the pizza at La Lanterna
Their drinks are very good as well and the atmosphere makes it special
La Lanterna was an absolutely wonderful experience! The atmosphere, food, and service were all top notch! My wife and I will be returning there soon
We just can't say enough about it
On a scale of 1 to 10? A 10!!!
A friend and I stumbled across this place a few years ago on a quest to find dessert one night
We have been going there ever since
It is definitely a good place to take your significant other or just hang out with friends
The staff are always very pleasant, the food is always good (we have tried almost all the desserts!!) and the owner is extremely attentive and treats you like family
Of course the fireplace in the winter is a bonus too!! Hands down one of my most favourite places to go - I plan on sharing this little hiding place with my boyfriend very soon!!
My boyfriend took me to La Lanterna last night for V Day
It was the most romantic spot I've ever been to in NYC- small, quaint, dimly lit with candles and jazz playing
The manager took care of us as if we were his own family, remembering names and checking up on us every five minutes
The food was as good as homemade, and all the suggestions were excellent
Totally swoon-worthy! I will definitely be going back soon and can't recommend it enough
!
The place is a perfect place for couples to go, very romantic and cozy
The chocolate mudcake is the best in the city
However, the service at the downstair dining room was HORRIBLE!!! The waiter was rude and obnoxious
We had a party of 3 and he commanded us to sit at a table suitable for 2, and he told us the other empty tables (MANY) were all reserved
I strongly recommend you to stay upstairs or go to the bar next door
this place is very cozy and great if you want to spend a romantic late night with your significant other
the pizzas are delicious, and so are their desserts
i always get the apple pie, but the past two times i visited, the waiter burnt the pie while he was supposed to warm it up
he served it to me like it was a big pile of burnt mush on the plate
If you got a date that you want to end just right
go to La Lanterna
Sit by the fireplace
have some sweets with a late night liquer
Perfect! The service is good
the atmosphere
incredible!!!
Perfect place to take a date
Perfect place to take a significant other
Perfect place to have a good conversation
Food if pretty good too
Absolutely no complaints,
great place to take a date,the candlelight just gives it a romantic touch
Its bit small but thats what gives it a cozy feeling
The service was great and the food was to
my best friend took me to this place and we can't stop going! it's a great place to relax
environment is great and staff is incredibly nice
i recommend seating downstairs where there is less crowding
Both the upstairs (with a fireplace and comfy round tables) and the basement (dark, and intimate with Billie Holiday music playing) are great
The food is delicious, the thin crust pizzas are incredible
For desert take the tiramisu, it is by far the best there
Overall a great place for a date
Also good when getting away from the wintery weather at night
take a seat by the fireplace then
nice and cozy place but the soup was cold, the pizza was cold
proscuit was not fresh, melone was terrible
For the best brick oven gourmet pizza La Lanterna is the place to get it from
A bit tight in space but very intimate and romantic for a first time date
The array of selection of wines allows you to transport yourself to a winery in Italy
It is delicious, romantic, cozy and convienently located near washington square park, for that romantic stroll after dinner
Everyone is pretty chill at this charming little west village late-night spot

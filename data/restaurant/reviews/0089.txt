after over an hour wait for our reservation, during which time no one bothered to come speak with us after the initial drink order, we were seated in a subdued gustav klimt painting, w/music that sounded like am radio
the service was overly attentive (4 diff
bussers came to the table in less than 5 minutes!), as if no one was in overall charge of the room
later saw a manager verbally abuse a waiter
the wine list? a joke for a restaurant of this caliber
can only rave about 1 of four dishes i had
what happened to this restaurant?
I cannot explain to you how obsssed I am with going out to eat, and how excited I was to go to dine there at it was nothing but a dissapointment
For starters, after sending them an email explaing what we were celebrating, and requesting some things that should have been granted, they were completly overlooked
The service was atrocious for a fine dining restaurant
We sat there struggling through our food, while our server never came back
I saw him squabbel with another server right infront of us
The server poured my aunts wine, then mine finished the bottle and left me with nearly half a glass
They crumbed the table once, although it was solied the entire meal
No one explained our food properly as it was brought out
Portion size-horrible, food-horrible
It was such a dissapointment to see an amazing room just go to waste
Better food and service at Bouley but the atmosphere is lovely
I adore this restaurant as a unique collection of choices each time I attend
I eat out every night of the week and this place still remains one of my top repeat dining experiences
Although it sometimes feels like it's filled with the Third Age crowd or people who go to a nice place one a year (for a special night), the food is divine and the price tag isn't bad
This is a must go place to eat
it's worth every penny
Service was the worst I have seen in a NY city upscale restaurant, we had a reservation for 2 at 9:30 we got our table at 10:30 to make matter worst the hostess seem to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown once seated the service did not improved a bit the water finally came to our table a good 15 minute after we were seated the guys was so distracted taking our order I had to repeat my questions twice to get a some attention
Other problem is the menu that make absolutely no sense if you remove the tasting menu, the fall menu and the 24 notice menu your are left with a few appetizer and entre to choose from! If you want you want great food and great service try Jean George or Craft
I brought a party of 5 who were visiting New York to Danube, and it didn't disappoint their expectations of NY haute cuisine
Whether it's meat, seafood or dessert, everything was of the highest-quality and prepared brilliantly
The kitchen is more Austrian-influenced than traditional Austrian, offering delicate and unique flavors
the white peach tart with vanilla-peach ice cream was amazing
The 4-course prix fixe for $75 is a steal, especially considering the near-perfect service we received (I've never had so many complimentary amuse-bouche and desserts at one sitting!)
Danube is definitely for special occasions
This restaurant located downtown Manhattan, is another creations of talented Mr
David Bouley
Mr
Bouley has done an excellent job creating this dining establishment with almost a museum sense, the artworks on the wall have a very Klimty feeling and the gold ceiling completes the rest of the experience
Menu was full of very tasty selections and the extensive wine selection, specialized in Austrian and European flavors
Service was immaculate
There was always a person waiting next to you, anytime you lift your head to ask a question without disrespecting your privacy
I really enjoyed the little treats kept coming from the kitchen
Make sure you take the gold card with you, this royal experience comes with a high price tag but it is worth it, once in a while
decor is a ten
True dining at it's finest
No expense spared to make you feel good
Chilled watermelon soup, smoked salmon pre fix menu or ala cart you cant go wrong
Diver scallops were divine along with chilled beets or high volocety pasta
entrees like LI duck, japanese halibut or beef cheeks were divine
ending with a simple sorbet to remind us of the days of fine dining before the influx of a restaurant on every corner
a must go to location with someone you love
service was amazing
I will definitly return
worth every penny spent
Decor's stunning, like a painting by Gustav Klimt
Wait staff pamper you like royalty
Chilled watermelon soup followed by smoked salmon
Foie gras two ways, was alternately sweet and pungent and delicate and was set off marvellously by the complimentary glass of Austrian dessert wine
Next, sweet pea soup with avocado and shrimp- I didn't know that peas could taste so good- and then beef cheeks
I could rhapodize about the flavor of the gelatin, the Tahitian vanilla caressing the vegetables, the spicy red wine sauce
It could have been a touch sweeter, but it was sublime
I was brought three complimentary desserts, apple creme brulee, walnut cake, white peach soup with elderflower sorbet, petit fours
I must win the lottery so I can hire a personal trainer and eat here every night
100$ for dinner for one including tip, app, main course and two glasses of wine
The decor is beautiful, the service attentive, and when people talk about certain meals being better than sex, they probably dined at Danube
I especially recommend ordering the duck, foie gras, and beef cheeks although it's probably hard to go wrong with anything on the menu
This was much more than I ever expected
A gorgeously exquisite setting surrounds you as you are waited on by a very courteous and attentive staff
Every course was delicious, including the multiple chef samples, brought to you from the chef throughout your entire meal
Absolutely delightful!
The food at Danube was very good
They gave a lot of complimentary food to try out which were all delicious
Be aware not to fill up on bread because they gave a variation for you to try
I guess that goes without saying
After having my appetizer and being serve the complimentary food I was stuffed
The complimentary salmon with horseradish sauce was delicious and I don't even like eating fish
I had the beef cheek as an entree and it was very tender and tastey
There were a lot of selections on the menu
Everyone should be able to find something they want to try
Danube is definitely worth going on special occassion
It's expensive but worth the experience
My first experience at Danube was wonderful (from food to service to decor)
As a result I took my parents there last night and I was very disappointed
The food was average: the almond crusted halibut was bland, while the sashimi appetizer was excellent
The service was careless
I would certainly go back and recommend Danube, but would caution for the inconsistency (especially considering the bill!)
The Scene Lemon-custard colored walls, arched ceilings, and plush carpeting set a serious tone at this former home to the legendary first iteration of Bouley
Tables are large and generously spaced, and the open room keeps the noise level low
The Food Scalini Fedeli's take on Northern Italian fare won't win any points for originality, but it is rich, satisfying and occasionally quite elegant
Highlights include a breaded veal chop with tomatoes and arugula, a pea-and-mushroom risotto topped with slivers of fried zucchini and doused with truffle oil, and a top-shelf roasted chicken with rapini and sausage
The French-leaning dessert roster includes apple tarts and creme brulee
I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing
This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
I took my bf here for his birthday
This place really blew us away
It's gorgeous - yellow vaulted ceilings in a warm setting
Downstairs is a wine cellar which at the time was being used for a private party
The service was outstanding - attentive waiter w/a great knowledge of the food and wine
Right after we ordered a taste of what to come was given to us - a sample of mushroom ravioli
It was so impressive we could have asked for more
Each course that was given to us was well prepaired

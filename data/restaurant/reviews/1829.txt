Rarely do you find a haughty-taughty restaurant telling you it's ok to come in jeans and t-shirts
The fact that this place is so well rated but still plenty down to Earth made me want to make it a regular hang out, could I afford to do so
The wait staff was very professional, yet friendly and the food was brought out in a timely manner
Not often praised for its desserts, Balthazar also offers some nifty niblets, so check it out (and don't wait for a special reason to do so)
I really come here more for the surroundings and the experience than the actual food
Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but not AMAZING
If you don't like loud busy places though, this probably isn't for you
Had lunch here
it's a really nice place and the food was pretty good, but it was nothing special
Not the most pleasant experience
Cramped and snotty
The server tried to up-sell the menu on every course
He kept asking about drinks, despite the full glasses on our table
When it was obvious that we were not moving, he took a 15-minute break
We had to get another server to take our dessert order
On the positive side, the hostess was great - personable and down-to-earth
Beware: the bartenders will keep your change
Maybe the place has changed since I went a year ago, but in my opinion Balthazar is loud, pretentious, overpriced and serves substandard food complemented by overpriced wine
A trendy new stop - very French atmosphere - worth it for when you are missing Paris
The dining room wait list was full, so we settled for a table in the bar area on a Friday night for dinner and were pleasantly surprised
Service was very helpful and friendly, and the food was near perfection
I had the roasted duck with potatoes and mushrooms and was delighted
For dessert we ordered a rasberry chocolate souffle and were impressed
Lighting, mood and general aesthetic were all impressive at this place
We also appreciated the more sophisticated crowd here, although there were some rowdy BTers that arrived a little later to drink
Would recommend this place to others and will definately be back for more
McNalley has done it again
Its like being in Paris again
Good food
Seating is a very tight
Come before noon on the weekend
you can actually get a table without reservations!
Great coffee and superb french toast during Sunday brunch keeps me (and many others) coming back for more
get there early or you may be waiting a while
took my boyfriend there for brunch and we had a great time
the food was excellent, but very filling
we tried the beef stroganoff and the macaroni au gratin
both were so good
to top it all off we finished with creme brulee
sooooo tasty! i would definitely suggest making reservations
we made them and were seated right away, but we saw a large group of people having to wait by the bar for tables to open up
The ambience of the decorating makes it a delight to enjoy any meal here
The food is always good, with many choices, such as the roasted chicken, but my favorite time to come is for Sunday brunch with a group of friends! And don't forget to bring home some of their amazing bread- there are so many varieties to choose from, alawys fresh, always delicious!
the cheeseburgers here are something not to be believed
by far the best in town and the best thing this restaurant has to offer
Try not to get bothered by some of the aloof waiters, or the long wait
They serve still my favorite baked breads in town
Not here for the quiet romantic dinner
Your whispered sweet nothings will be lost in a jarring mass of banging cutlery, falling plates and half-shouted conversations
It all adds to Balthazar's energetic buzz
You are dining in New York City, remember
We found the waitstaff to be friendly and helpful despite being in the midst of a weekend supper crush
This was our third visit and the food has continually been high quality
The goofy reservation policy reeks of Nineties excess (a table at the far superior Union Square Cafe' is easier to get)
But as Balthazar's hipster cache has fallen off in recent years, luckily, little else has
Tranformed to Paris
Loud but good
Seafood tower is a great date share
Love the bar snacks
Brunch is never a miss
I honestly don't see anything special in this place, and don't quite understand how they can justify the price they are charging
I was there for a brunch - maybe the bar scene at night is better ??
came here for dinner on a thursday night
the service was unattentive
the food was so-so
me and my friend both left half of our entree plates untouched
frites were excellent
balthazar should really consider investing in their glasswares - they looked old and dirty
We had no problems making reservations, we were promptly seated the wait staff was very friendly, attentive, the food was excellent
This is an absolutely divine place to go for a weekend brunch with friends, visiting parents, or your better half that you'll have to nudge to wake up
The service is slightly nose-in-air but they get the job done, if only to serve you some of the most excellent food (try the Eggs Benedict) I've had in fice years of NYC restaurant hopping; the meal we had was continuosly supplemented with exquisite fresh bread which was a plus
Few restaurants keep a sense of excitement and purpose past 6 months
Balthazar just gets better every time
The food is great, the wine well-priced, the staff professional
It works for a date, to take your mom out to brunch or share a shellfish tower with 4 friends
People were outstanding
Could not do enough for us
Best Steak
A little too loud for light conversation
We went with another couple
Their recommendation
His wife and I had bouillabaisse
Below average, hardly memorable
It was julienne of vegetables in fish stock with 1 mussel, 1/3 of small lobster tail; several pieces of fish and 3 boiled potatoes
My wife and he had steak frite
It was only ok
Worst was service
My wife watched our waiter take unemptied carafes (about 1-2 left in bottle) from tables that were not finished
Before she realized it, he did it to us
Before that, every time we took a sip, he was pouring from the carafe
That wasn't service - - that was pushing booze for a higher bill and tip
Will never go back
Our friends were embarrassed
Too many superior restaurants in NYC to go here
even once! Noisy too, but bearable
It is NY after all
The Scene This Pan-Asian Soho spot is as popular as ever, attracting swank crowds of shoppers, tourists and neighborhood office workers decked out in designer duds
The minimalist, airy room is a triple-threat: teashop, noodle bar and Asian grocery all in one, with exposed-brick walls, casual plastic cups and a visible kitchen
The Food Dishes hail from China, Vietnam, Korea and Thailand, and the combos, which include spring rolls, chicken satay, dumplings and duck pancakes, allow you to sample a bit of each country's cuisine
While there are a number of vegetarian plates featuring tofu, the tangy Bul Go Gui with sesame, ginger and jasmine rice is a beef-lover's paradise

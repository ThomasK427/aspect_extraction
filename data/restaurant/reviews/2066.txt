but way overpriced and the portions are absolutely MINISCULE
a $12 appetizer should be more than just a nibble or two, and the entrees are the size of appetizers in a normal restaurant
Sure, the food is great -- it should be for what they're charging for it!
I recently dined here with a few friends and it couldn't have been better
The food was wonderful! Our server was welcoming, very efficent informative
This place has been added to my list of favorite NYC places
our first time in what they say is one of the better mexican restaurants in new york
they're obviously going for the fancy schmancy looks and feel here
which is fine IF everything lives up to that
food is actually pretty and creative
not the usual mexican for sure
nice inside decor and beautiful garden
alas, when we pointed out to our waitress that the wrong (much more expensive) wine was on our check, things started to fall apart
waitress insisted, manager insisted
we felt like petty criminals
sad
my husband and i love mexican food and we're always on the lookout for an upscale version of good, solid mexican fare
mi cocina does a good job at the packaging: nice village corner, cute decor, all neat and preppy
however, the food can be uneven in quality and sadly the service as well
the overall experience is mixed and somewhat overpriced
Every New Yorker needs to experience this place
For the people who didn't enjoy it should not be going to Mexican restaurants
This is authentic food and wonderful service
It reminds me of home
Arizona
Reserve a table so that you don't have to wait
Whoever said one should not attend this place is crazy
For those of us who have lived in teh Jane Street block adjacent to this culinary place of feast, know how very well this establishment has always strived for great customer service, and great food
Do yourself and your date a favor
go! The hosting staff is always warm and inviting, the food is top notch mexican
Try the Pollo Poblano special
This sauce is amazing! Try Mi Cocina for yourself, you will return often
we all love the village
but steer clear of this mexican rip off!! food and serice are average - even though it's on the pricey side
the real deal killer is the racket they have going where they put items on your check that you have not ordered
after our unpleasant experience we heard that this had happened to other people before!! steer clear
always on the lookout for good food in the village, i ventured into this newish mexican joint
it's got a pleasant vibe, nice decor and is on a very pretty corner
so it started out well
alas, we found the food quite mediocre and bland
price level is way too high for the quality and the service too
pretty slow and incompetent service didn't help
maybe we just got there on a bad day but we really can't be bothered to go back and check
friends of mine told me to go check out that ultimate upscale mexican
i have had a bad experience there before but figured maybe they got their act together
food was actually pretty good and inventive, sadly though service is a terrible as it ever was and what you get for your money is an overhyped joke
went with a group of friends to celebrate b-day
nice restaurant, cute garden, decent food
sadly, we got into an argument about guac delivered to our table which we didn't order
service is arrogent and most unhelpful indeed
to our horror, we actually found the guac (about 10 dollars) on the tab
management was adamant that it was out mistage and the whole thing escalated
too bad it looks like a little gem from the outside
but beware!!
I ran in here on a whim recently and thought the food was pretty good
The place is very spacious but TOO BRIGHT! I felt like I was eating in a grocery story
The garden outside looked beautiful, but it was raining so we couldn't sit there
The tamale appetizer is one large tamale, which was pretty good
The tortilla soup was nice and spicy
The carne asada was a delicious filet mignon, with SUPER GOOD GUACAMOLE, great beans, and a nice mixture of peppers and onions
The chicken enchilada with mole sauce was great as well
pleasent dinner with my wife in a highly rated mexican
or so we thought
even though the food tasted really good, the incompetent service and arrogant service did spoil our evening quite a bit
our neighbor table got into a dispute about items on their check that they didn't order
but were forced to pay! very ugly scenes
I cannot comment as far as authentic regional cuisine goes, but this is by far the best Mexican I have had in NYC in a while
The staff is helpful and courteous and the food is just very good
This is upscale food in comfortable surroundings so do not be surprised at what it will cost you
A little on the high end but the margueritas are fantastic
And that is coming from a non-marguerita drinker
We went with another couple for a friend's birthday and found the food, drinks and service all exceptional
I will be going back again
SERIOULSY - THESE ARE THE BEST WINGS YOU CAN FIND IN NYC!!! SAT SUN $19 ALL YOU CAN EAT ( DRINK TOO!) BEST DEAL IN MANHATTAN HANDS DOWN!
huge wings that actually have some meat on them, great prices, great bar scene, friendly service, timely delivery, ice cold beer, those waffle fries that i love, and did i mention the quesdillas? lunch, dinner, drunken late nights, great spot in a basement bar - highly recommended
Love the wings - the best in the city!! I love going to Down the Hatch after work with a group of friends to have cheap beer and incredibly hot Atomic Wings!
down the hatch is a great bar with the best wings in town
if you like cold beer, good tunes and friendly bartenders, this place is the tops
always a good time
Looking for cold beer and hot wings? Then this is your place
Atomic Wings
aka Down the Hatch has some of the best wings that I have come across
The restaurant/bar is small and gets extremely crowded for sporting events but what are you expecting
During football and basketball season you can eat all the wings with 2 pitchers of beer each Saturday for only $20
Good bargain
The Scene Fun-seeking families, bawdy bachelorette parties and kitsch-loving locals have always enjoyed this down-home scene, decked out in black-and-white tablecloths, antler chandeliers and antique ads
The urban-folksy servers sing along to Patsy Cline on the sound system, which may explain why the plates aren't cleared till the cows come home
The Food The Southern-inspired menu offers irresistible guilty pleasures like Frito pie--a bag of corn chips slathered with chili--and a messy fried onion loaf, as well as a respectable hangar steak, flavored with chipotle-lime butter
The Cajun fried chicken could use some crunch, but a nicely seasoned meat loaf Wellington is tasty
The ice cream "baked potato," an oblong ball of vanilla ice cream covered in hot fudge, whipped "sour" cream and pistachio "chives" is a great reminder of why you're there--and that eating out doesn't always have to be so serious
I was hungry and we sat outside
The Lone Star beers came quickly
The hanger steak was recommended and was very good (with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach)
My buddy got the pulled pork sandwich which was also recommended and very good (with sweet potato fries)
We waited all of 15 mins for the food
We also got a brownie and ice cream which was better than I thought it would be
It was a wednesday night in the spring and the whole thing cost 55 bucks
I was satisfied
After ordering a bunch of (mediocre) appetizers for the table to share and a ton of drinks we were told by the hostess that we were going to have to move to the bar because the dining room was for people ordering main courses not appetizers
Clearly our waiter had not mentioned to her that we were not just hanging out at the table but waiting on the deserts we had ordered to come out! I have never been treated so badly by any restaurant ever - would never let anyone I know eat here

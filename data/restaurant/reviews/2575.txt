The food is fresh and varied, great use of herbs and seasonings, WONDERFUL sweet potato fries, and the weekend brunch - $9
95 for beverage (including wine or cocktail) and entree from two dozen-plus selections, or $12
95 with dessert - is unbeatable
Make a reservation on weekends or at pre-theatre times
We try to get here as often as we can!
It was 7:45 PM and they had a special that starts at 8 PM
When I asked the host if we could have the special he said absolutely not
It starts at 8PM
When I asked him why, he kept cutting me off and not letting me ask a question AT ALL!! Then he said he grew tired of this and didn't have time for me to talk to him
He cut me off 5 times and then practically shooed me away
For standard pasta, in which I've been to this place before, it is not worth it
I was surprised by my second visit and will never return again
My girlfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner one evening
We were sadly disappointed by the food and service
The ambiance is nice, but the wait staff was rude and unattentive
We thought the food would be great based on the owner and head chef, but it was lacking just about everything from flavor to presentation
The only saving grace was that they offered a early dinner prix-fixed offer
The cost was $10 for wine, salad/soup, and a main course
Unfortunately, I could have gotten a better meal for $10 at any fast food joint or pizza joint
We give Pietrasanta four thumbs down between the two of us
This restaurant is a good place to go for a pre-theater dinner
Service is quick and efficient, and the food was quite enjoyable
My main grievance would be the noise level and the large number of tables in a rather small area
Overall, it was a satisfying experience, and it is a good bet for a dinner before going to see a show
The prices were very reasonable as well
For a normal dinner, I prefer a place that has a bit more room and that has a slightly more relaxed vibe
I was here on Valentine's Day, and even though it was very crowded (even with all the tables so close to each other), the entire staff seemed to go out of their way to make us happy
The food was awesome
They may have been able to decorate a bit better, however my issue might just be with the space itself and not what they have done with it
Highly recommended overall
a friend worked at a radio station and gave me last minute broadway tickets
I live in Central New Jersey -would get out of work at 5pm-drive into the city-be there by 6:45pm-7:00pm
Stand at the bar and order my dinner-by the time it was ready-a table would be ready-then have plenty of time to relax and eat then get to a show
The fried cheese appetizer is incredible - and every entree i've had has been wonderful! Hats off to them for getting everyone to the show on time!!
My daughter and I ate here on our visit to NYC in May 2001
My partner and I will be in New York this week and it's on our list
We had a great bottle of Chianti!
We went there after a show, we were seated promptly, drinks arrived then dinner
Then we waited and waited and waited
Tried to get the waitress's attention and were ignored, at one point she came over with two dinnners that she thought were ours, she forgot we had dinner, finally she came back and wanted to take our orders? We told here we had already had dinner and we wanted the check
She mumbled something about our order being closed out on the register
I won't go back, there are too many other choices in NYC
I've been here many times in past
Recently, I was showing relatives around the city and stopped in for a drink
They sat us at a table without bothering to ask if we wanted dinner, not our problem really
After the rude waitress took our order we were sipping our drinks when the manager comes over and says we have to leave as the tables are reserved for dinner patrons
For one thing, nobody was waiting for dinner anyway secondly, THEY sat us there without asking whether we wanted dinner or not, again not our problem, third and most importantly that is just an unbelievably poor way to treat your customers
And you wonder where the stereotype of New Yorkers as being rude comes from? I left a penny tip
Obviously I am NEVER coming back here, it's not like there is a shortage of bars in the city
My second visit to this Pub, sorry I can not agree with the rest
Waitress forgot drinks, and watched us begin our dinner without even water, strange
Food average, wife had sheppards pie and I fish chips
I do not understand how one can make bad french fries but I had them here
They were so brown my wife thought they were made from sweet potatoes
On the plus side there is an upstairs bar and seating for us older folk
Downstairs is noisy and crowded
Great food, prices staff make this a must
Highly recommended
I go to many sushi places in the city and Sushi Zen is the best so far
Waiters and waitresses are polite and helpful
But, just make sure to make a reservation-it's usually quite crowded
I piled on the wasabi, forgot my manners in my haze, thoughtlessly placed my chop sticks down in a manner associated with someone who finished a meal-two parallel chopsticks placed on the bowl, rather than two chop sticks placed in a cross hatch position-suddenly, the server appeared out of no where (I assume the server kept a watchful eye upon us, but I never felt his presence in the slightest) offered to clear my plate-I write, offered because I want to differentiate his professional manner from the countless rushers who wisk our plates away at other establishments
When I declined, he made certain not to offer again- even when I repeated the mistake-being attentive enough to notice, offer and refill my wine glass without reference to nor notice of my table manners
Kudos to the staff and the other review -- they are polite in the true sense
If you have no consideration for the size of the final cheque, this might very well be the best sushi bar in NYC
It is close to some of my other favourites (like Nobu and Sushiden) but this one is even better
I like the sushi bar as this gives a certain extra at this place - they are just magnificent
The sushi/sashimi is outstanding and the speciality dishes are beyond greatness
It is more traditionally and lacks gimmicks like russian caviar and gold leaf- and if it that want you desire there are places for that
Here the sushi master is unusally helpful and amicable
This assists in making the experience outstanding
The presentation of the food was outstanding
The price tag was hefty though (to say the least) and I can't really disclose what my bill was but somehow I wasn't surprised
A co-worker told me about Sushi Zen
We went on 12/17/04 (in the midst of xmas shopping pandomonium) and waljed into heaven! I can't tell you how DELICIOUS the sushi is here! We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed plate after plate of the freshest sushi in the city
and I'm ALL about sushi! Only take a date who won't pay attention to the amount on the check or go with friends and clink glasses for a while!
HAVING BEEN TO TOKYO AND EATEN SUSHI IN THE MAIN FISH MARKET--I AM WELL AWARE OF GOOD SUSHI, IF YOU WANT CELEB'S GO SOME PLACE ELSE!!! AND LEAVE THE RESTAURANT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE TO HAVE A GOOD MEAL AND SAKE
a few weeks after returning from my vacation in Japan, I had a crave for sushi sashimi
I have found a gold mine!!   the restaurant serves sushi and sashimi as if I went back to Tukiji in Japan!  Traditional sushi layout (really nice plates!), with mouth watering sashimi that melts in your mouth! I recommend everyone to dine at the sushi counter! you can order straight from the chefs!  the prices are very reasonable (slightly higher than the common Japanese restaurants) but its certainly worth every dollar spent!!
This was some of the tastiest sushi I've ever had
The crispy fish salad has a light fishy taste, not too overpowering
The chicago roll is excellent, and the filet mignon was perfectly cooked and light
sorry for the prices you pay here are other eateries just as good
i feel like i am paying for the ambiance rather than the food
the sushi is very good tho
svc can be more friendlier
SUM IT: try it once if you must to judge for yourself, but there are other places where you can get more for your valued buck - will not sacrifice on quality freshness!
Our Japanese friends took my husband and I to the sushi bar here for dinner
Wonderful! The tuna, salmon, and mackerel were the best sushi we've had ever
Excellent sweet scallop and shrimp also
Less favored: yellowtail and some flat fish, but I think that was due to characteristics of the fish itself rather than preparation
Wonderful also was a mushroom medley with garlic--don't miss out on this!  Excellent delicate sake and green tea
The green tea and red bean ice creams were a lovely finish
The serving pottery they use is also a treat--really beautiful, and such variety! The service is impeccable
Value unknown because our friends treated, but suspect it's very expensive
Our friends knew how to order (they didn't even look at the menu) so I wonder if we would have had such a great experience on our own
They've moved, but the sushi has not changed
Don't be dissuaded by the prices; every bite is worth the price
The toro is fantastic and the size and cut perfect
For those unimpressed by Yama/Nobu-style bigger is better sushi, Sushizen, where gimmickless quality is the primary concern might not be the place

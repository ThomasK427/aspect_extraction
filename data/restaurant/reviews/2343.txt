For 70 bucks, a group of four can suck down the blinding, two-and-a-half gallon Trash Can Punch
And yes, they even serve Pabst Blue Ribbon and Natural Light
The Food The Southern menu is cheap and generously portioned
The ribs are among the best in the city and are available in both "wet" and "dry rub" versions
The former are sweeter, juicier and more tender, while the latter are spicier and more savory
Collard greens and mashed potatoes make for good side orders, and the butter-slathered corn bread is moist and sweet
Brother Jimmy's is also good for kids--all children younger than 12 eat for free
As a Southern transplant now living in New York, I'm a huge HUGE fan of the delectable take out at this UES gem
Their mac and chesse is super tasty and the corn bread keeps you coming back from more
I personally recommend the hot or bbq wings
Their take-out service is top knotch-- always very nicely packed with seperate containers and all utensils, etc you need to enjoy your meal
I've never been in to the Bait Shack, but you should definitely think of them for take-out
Absolutely A+
I liked the food, but this was a sports bar
I didn't like the atmosphere at all
The waitress was nice, but other customers were loud, music was country loud and customers were drunk
oh the drinks were great
Its not a bad place but there better ones
The foods okay but certainly not the the best barbeque I 've had
It definitely has a frat party feel to it which may be okay if your single and in your early 20s
I've been their several times (friends who live a block a way insist) and I never been impressed
I am from the South and I know good soul food
The barbecue is pretty good (albeit drastically overpriced), but the rest of the food is lackluster
The atmosphere is revolting --- Basically a barn with junk hung on the walls
It's impossible to enjoy oneself because of all the heavily intoxicated b+t people trying to get picked up
The music is decade nostalgic and the food doesn't quite fill one's need for soul food
Plus, it's way overpriced
Hit this place on Mondays for $15 all you can eat ribs and wings
It is so yummmmy for the price and you get beers too
I love the Hush Puppies for an appetizer- only bad food is the nachos bc they are extremely soggy
I always end my night at one of the three Brother Jimmy's
They have a great scene
The Fish Bowls are dangerous
But great time
I went last night for Monday Night Football
Big Mistake
They were not prepared and the WORST waitress was in charge of our table
She completely forgot about us
We had to order our pitcher 3 times and she still never brought
Very frustrating
Who can eat wings without cold beer? Good over to 2nd Ave and try out Blondies! Great wings
My friends I have been bouncing back forth between this Brother Jimmy's and the one at 80th Amsterdam for well over 5 years now
We never miss a Birthday, Thanksgiving Eve, Promotion, or going there for no reason at all
Last year we celebrated New Year's Eve there and it was our best New Year's yet! Go here if you enjoy a party atmosphere with loud music, exciting people, great BBQ food, and you have a laid back personality with a bit of a wild side too
I highly recommend indulging in a fish bowl just once at Brother Jimmy's
I guarantee you'll go back for more
If you're from the south then this has to be a stop on your trip
This place has sweet tea! Wow! Good sweet tea at that
Wednesday night is Southern Appreciation Day, 25% off your bill with a valid southern I
D
The food is great - southern cuisine
It is very busy so get there early
The busier, the louder, and it tends to get very loud in here
If you want a quiet dinner this probably isn't the place to go, but if you want good Southern cuisine, at a reasonable price stop by Brother Jimmy's and soak up the south
Loads of UNC and other ACC memorabilia on the walls too!
Brother Jimmys is a taste of the south right in NYC
go here to watch ACC college hoops or March Madness
guaranteed to meet other die-hard hoops fans
also they have great southern BBQ and great drinks such as Trash Can Punch
i had wrote in a while ago saying that i had fun here but that i not the case anymore, if possiable the male bartenders got more cocky then ever
they all seem old now and not as good looking as it use to be
me and my girlfriends will not be coming back here ever again and i would suggest the same for others
the guys a dirt balls for out of the city in one word CHEESEY
Thank god for the bouncers where very friendly and helpful getting the cheese away from us
brother jimmy's are great! the best one is located on 92nd and third
best looking waitresses/bartenders and much more fun atmosphere
a little smaller though
worth the trip to the upper east side
hot chicks, great food, fun after hours, best BBQ on the east side
This place has great ribs, not to mention hot waitresses, its a great place to meet for drinks and dinner before you go out, but it does turn into a bit of a sausage fest on the weekends
Great place to catch the ACC
Whenever I'm longing for a taste of Southern Hospitality, great food and drinks, I go to Brother Jimmy's
All of the NC stuff and memorabilia from the South make me feel right at home
On about 5 nights out of the week they have some sort of all-you-can-eat/drink combo that is well worth the money
It gets no better than White Trash Wednesdays!  The waitresses are usually incredibly attractive
That's quite a plus
If you have a big group, the Trash Can punch is a must
I went recently with a friend for dinner and a drink
It is quite loud, but I'm going to chalk that up to the annoying man who was practially sitting on our table for half of the meal
The food was really good, my only complaint was that the portions were too big
My friend and I shared corn fritters (YUM!) and then I got a an appetizer or BBQ rib tips
Was I surprised when it came out! Huge portion
But it was very tasty! I did feel like I was at Hooters, but whatever, it's Friday and the drinks were coming, so who cares?
Not only are the beers cheap and the food pretty good - my friends and I have hooked up with several of the waitresses, who are not afraid to prance around in their tiny t-shirts and little else once they get out of work
For this, I give it rave reviews
Thank God good BBQ exists in NY
No babybacks here! Great pork ribs, pork shoulder, and tasty side dishes
They fall into the NY trap of serving the typical SW fare, but steer clear of all that and eat up some BBQ and southern favorites with no frills
The service is good but all the people in the place could slow them down a bit, be patient; enjoy the music, the game, and that cold brew in your hand, you are in for something great!
i us to think brother jimmy's cared about there costumers, not anymore
the waitresess are suck to food was worse and if i see the same bartenders again(they been there foreeeeveer) and treat you like a wiked step child
I will and me friends will never go back there again
I love this joint! I loved my pull pork sandwish, I loved my shrimp po boy, I loved the variety
If you don't mind the fat, this is the place to be
However, make sure you are not too hungry when you get there because it takes a while for the kitchen to make your dishes
Brother Jimmy's is one of my favorites
It brings me back to my ACC college days! There are plenty of TV's to watch the games and the food is good
Beer ranges from PBR to more sophisticated brew
The wait staff is always a lot of fun
great bar with great bartenders

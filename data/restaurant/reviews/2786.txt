In Short The weathered bar, well-worn tables, and chipped black paint on the walls give this corner tavern a lived-in feel
The evening clientele is as mixed at the surrounding neighborhood--young artsy girls gossiping over pints beside old neighborhood guys complaining about aches and pains
Everyday appetizers include fried calamari, chicken wings and pizza
Dinner options range from no-frills pub grub, like fish-and-chips, to fancier offerings, like seafood linguini with garlic crostini
Loads of potential but fell short with 1 mistake, NEGLECT! I liked the place for the convenience food options and would have liked to become a patron
It WAS going to be my BK new spot as barhopping in Manhattan is too much
Unfortunately, disappointment came to soon as I was trying to plan a dinner for my mom's bday in the restaurant's garden area only to find out that the proprietor of the restaurant doesn't return phone calls
5 days later Im choosing a place in DUMBO which is less convenient but I got their attention on many occasions and they, instead, got my patronage
A relative of mine who frequents Tavern recommended it, so I was very surprised that my appearance at the restaurant as well as two phone calls to arrange a dinner was deemed unimportant
Good luck to the next event planner with this establishment
What a disappointing local hang-out
Bad food, unfriendly service
What else can I say? Bad, bad, bad! There has to be a better bar -- go anywhere but here
Really unacceptable
if you can't make it to prospect heights for dinner then come for the weekend brunch! $12 prix-fixe gets you one alcoholic drink (bloody mary, mimosa, etc), basket of muffins + croissants, and the best eggs ever! don't leave without getting the tavern eggs!
Tavern On Dean is great
I only wish I still lived in ther neighborhood
There's nothing like it in Bushwick that's for sure
We're not talking four stars or anything, but the food is good
The portions are generous
The drinks are strong
And you might catch a cowboy in the garden on a Friday evening, with his horse parked in the lot next door
I've brought friends from out of town and from the other boroughs and they're jealous
Manhattanites gawk at the prices, and Mom Dad can't wait to come
If I can't get reservations at Two Toms, Tavern on Dean won't have the massive pork chops, but I'll still get a good meal, and I'll be almost as happy
Living in Brooklyn, Tavern on Dean is in the rolodex of places to go
or not
While the food is inspired for a cozy little neighborhood joint its quality is at best inconsistent
Having dined there over a half-dozen I have tried everything on the menu but depending on what night, time and who is taking your order, be prepared for loud, smokey (it is a bar afterall) and herbed waitstaff
These things will leave a bad taste in your mouth
If you are there on a good night and in fact are able to fully enjoy the pseudo high-brow food then bully for you
That 17% gratuity included (a la the neighbor-hood) is acceptable but if catch Tavern on Dean on an off night that 17% will need to be taken with a you-save-cheapo-size roll of Tums!
great setting, awesome outdoor setting, good music, dependable food at a fair price
not sure what I'd do w/out it
probably move
try the turkey burger, penne, and fish n chips
someone get them a delivery service!!!
In Short This old-fashioned luncheonette, festooned with artificial flowers and signs touting the cherry lime rickeys, egg creams and banana-walnut pancakes, is favorite pitstop for folks visiting the Brooklyn Museum and Botanical Gardens
Everyone's friendly, especially the genial owner, Gus Vlahadas, who's responsible for the thick milkshakes and juicy burgers
by far anyone who comes to this restaurant leaves with a smile and promising to come back
Its just an all around great place to eat the owner comes around and shakes your hand and brings you newapaper and they serve you cookies and oranges as you are waiting on line and sitting
Please just check it out for your self and I know that you will feel the same
The service and the food are that good that it doesn't really matter how long you wait! It's a classic
My favorites there are: chocolate milshake!mmm, any type of pancakes or waffles! and eggs!
I've been going to Tom's for about four years now
I love it because it's a quaint little place to grab a bite
Sometimes I grow a bit weary of dining in those pretentious, haughty taughty, high fashion eateries
The prices are small, the servings are big, I'm a happy camper
Nothing fancy here
Eat and go, but it's a part of the 'hood that just has to be here
Cheap and good, especially when you're hungry
this place is amazing
it's totally an indescribable experience you must have for yourself! you feel whisked back to a time where friendliness, promptness and service were number one
i loved the coffee, cookies and oranges while you wait! and the food comes so fast! this is my favorite restaurant
the only drawback is that it's closed on sundays
so just go any other day of the week and you're all set!
People in the Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Park Slope area rave about Tom's
But I highly doubt that they rave about the food
They may love the wacky/tacky decore, the overly gracious host, Gus, and his staff, the loads of freebies (oranges, cookies, lollies and wet naps), but the food is just mediocre
Plentiful, with many choices and variations, but very mediocre
You get greasy breakfasts and lunches served on greasy tables with hovering flies
If that's your thing, go to Tom's, but if it's not
you have been warned
I work in the neighborhood, and if I had time to go to Tom's for lunch everyday I would
The staff are THE BEST! and I don't compliment service often
The menu is large and everything I've tried is good
And who can say no to free orange slices and cookies?!
Let's calm down folks, this is just a diner
The food's pretty good, but the only amazing item is the pancakes
The restaurant itself is cramped, the heating and air conditioning only work in parts of the restaurant, and it's none too clean
And for a diner, it's not that cheap! If you want a real diner, I'm afraid you'll have to go all the way to Jersey
Great food, great staff
After a couple of phone take-out orders, the woman answering the phone will recognize your voice and ask if you want your standard order which she has by now memorized
Try the House Special LoMein and the Chicken with String Beans
I think that this tiny place definitely deserves all the praise one can think of
I was told that they have been at the same location for 20 years with the same chef and waitress (husband wife)
The food is delicious and the wine list is well-founded
Everything is prepared daily and served as if you're a guest at their home rather than a customer who's there to eat, pay and go
I wish there were more places like this on earth
This tiny place consistently prepares imaginative, wholesome and delicious meals
And they've been doing it for years
For three hours, 6 nights a week, you're likely to get a perfectly grilled sea bass, tender lamb or a you-couldn't-ask-for-a-better steak
The wine list is small, but should have something to please any diner
The desserts are never flawed
The woman serving, who's also one of the owners (the other owner is the sole chef), is understated, gracious and very knowledgeable
These people love what they do and it clearly shows
One of the top fine dining places in NYC
With a 28 food rating from Zagat's we came to Garden Cafe with high expectations
The food was very good
A 28? Nah, more like a 24, but very respectable, especially for the prices
The wine list is limited but very good
The atmosphere is just ok
It's a small place and cozy
It appears that it hasn't yet been discovered by the foodies quite yet
The service was average
I don't mean to damn Garden Cafe with faint praise
It's worth a try
I'll probably go back
Weirdly, this unprepossessing little place right by the D/Q stop on Seventh Avenue has some of the best pizza in the city
It's not much to look at, but some pizza genius must lurk within, and he's got a superb line in calzones, too

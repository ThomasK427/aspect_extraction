I have seen all of the glowing reviews, and I'm confused because I went during one of the first days they were open, and was treated similarly to the author of the one bad review here
Our group was definitely late for our reservation, however during the 2 earlier phone conversations I'd had with a hostess, making the reservation, a 20 minute table holding policy was never mentioned
Nor did there seem to be any attempt to accomodate us - we were told simply that they had given away our table and there was nothing they could do
I understand the rules of supply and demand, but the lack of customer service and overall indifference of all staff members I encountered were really very unfortunate
I can only hope that in the future they remember that in New York, there's always something better
We went there last night without reservation and were promptly seated
The hostess was graceful and extremely nice to us
You can definitely tell that it is a new spot from the bar staff
However, they were courteous and amiable
The wait staff was on their way to master their profession
The food was excellent overall (The sashimi dish can be improved)
If you like pork, you MUST try the pork shank
It was one of the best in the city
The flavor was subtle yet the dish was intensely satisfying
I thought the atmosphere was spectacular, the food beyond words, and the hostess was a bombshell
I will frequent this establishment as long as I live in this fine city
one love
Welcome to the world of big egos
It is this reviewer's opinion that a newly opened restaurant should be as accommodating as possible, especially when it is empty
However, one arriving 20 minutes late to Jefferson will be turned away by one of the awful hostesses (owner should think about customer relations school for these women)
Overall, the atmosphere is very cold, sparsely decorated, and generally not much fun
This new spot is a winner, creative dishes, very cool room, ingenious design to keep noise levels down and great bar
The staff seems mildly inexperienced (well, the place is brand new) but very eager to please
I had a very pleasant experience and I recommend it!!!
Ok, I was looking forward to a cute brazilian french cafe, and that it certainly was
But the food was really bland
The menu was typical italian/american i thought, with a little Brazilian twist
The crpes were ok, not very flavorful or imaginative
Honestly, it wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the greatest
I do have to say, kudos to the the lone waitress who handled everyone that night
It was a really relaxed, laid back cafe, and we didn't feel like we couldn't get her attention
She was attentive and tried to cater to everyone's need as quickly as possible
This cozy restaurant is personal and intimate- a great date place if you want to have tasty food and a quiet atmosphere for conversation
I had the Brazailian steak and the spinach and cheese crepe for dinner - the steak was tender accompanied with mashed potatoes and salad, but salty! A bit too salty for my preference
The crepe was great! I would go back for the location, intimacy and good value
but not worth travelling far for
Great brunch food in the croque monsieur / madame
Evening meals can be a bit more hit and miss (the brazilian dishes are definately worth a try, even the burger) but the service is usually great and the food is good quality and value
Just avoid it in extremes of temparature - the heating and aircon don't deal with them well
Great place to have a glass of wine and chill with friends on picture perfect block in Soho
I like the hamburgers, salads, and crepes
The desserts are also awesome and made fresh
Highly recommended!
In your next walk thru Prince St, make a right at McDougall and look for La Palette
Really tasty food
I personally recommend any crepe and the star of the house, the brazilian french fusion burger
Different than anything you've tried before
Even well done, it comes juicy
For starters, try the very brazilian fried yucca and cheese balls
Because everything is fresh, it takes some time to prepare
If you are in a hurry, not the place to be
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners! How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?! I asked for a simple medium rare steak
It first came well done, and I politely sent it back
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust, around a raw and cold inside
Two wasted steaks -- what a crime!
I am a waitress, and I usually tip over 20%, but at MJ Grill I almost wanted to leave nothing (of course I didn't)
We went for dinner and sat at the bar
First, the hostess gave us a nasty look when asked if we could eat at the bar, and then just swished her hand to indicate we could seat ourselves
Our food took forever, the bartender seemed more interested in refilling drinks for the regulars and never even brought bread or water, as requested
Plus, the food was way over priced (even for Manhattan) and while it was decent in taste, nothing made up for the outlandish prices
NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
This place has a strong pedigree, being an offshoot of the excellent Mark Joseph steakhouse
however, on two different lunchtime occasions, the service was brutally slow and inefficient
Must the paper tablecloths be cut to fit exactly while you stand and wait to be seated?? And how about asking if you would like more $3 soft drinks before bringing them to the table? Food was above average, when it finally arrived, but very pricey
Look elsewhere for a solid and timely lunchtime experience
MJ Grill is owned by the same group from MarkJoseph
and it shows
The food is fantastic, great ambiance
great service
The steak was terrific
A little pricey
but worth it
Had dinner here last weekend
We were presented with the bill and as I pulled out my credit card a waitress passing by remarked, Cash Only
This has to be one of the only places not to accept credit cards in the Slope
Even worse, this was not posted ANYWHERE - not on the door, not on the menu, nowhere
A perfectly nice dinner was ruined because I had to go sprinting down 5th Ave
in search of an ATM (the one the waitress told me to go to was out of order)
The only reason I can think of for a restaurant to be cash only is that some under the table accounting is going on
Skip this - there are equally good places for sushi around Brooklyn, with nicer gardens and no annoying techno DJs
We eat at Nana very frequently and are never disappointed
The food was good, very good in fact
We were seated quickly and didn't wait long for the food
But this place is sooooo noisy! They play loud techno music, more suitable to a club than a restaurant
When we mentioned the noise level to the waitress, she turned into John Belushi-like Samarai Waitress, and said, its ambiance, the owner likes it that way, look we even have a DJ
She was clearly offended and suggested we were uncool
Maybe I am getting old; but I don't think sushi needs loud techno music, or a condescending waitress
Enjoyed it
Sushi was good beef entree as well
Try the volcano roll
Wait staff was good too
We got hammered off saki and had a blast
the food here was very good
definitely worth the trip from nyc or queens
soft shell crab is done just right
nothing is too heavy or overpowering
can't go wrong with any of the main dishes
appetizers are hit and miss
service is great, great space, and prices can't be beat
dishes are creatively spiced and beautifully presented

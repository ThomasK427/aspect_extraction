I ordered a calamari salad, a tuna tartare, cuban spiced chicken and 2 glasses of sangria
Everything is family style, portions are huge
I was very impressed by their calamari salad and tuna tartare
The tuna tartare was on top of a wonton skin which was very tasty
However I was not impressed by their chicken
It was definitely something that you could easily make at home
It came with salsa, which was nothing special, the coconut rice too
That dish was about $30 which I thought was not worth it
But do try something else on their menu, the other foods there looked great
The decor reminds me of Miami nightclubs, and we sat in a cool communal strip, where you share your table with people
Be prepared to spend about $35 a person, great place for a date
Went here for our wedding anniversary
I am 1/2 cuban and my husband Asian, we were really able to have a blend of our typical food in one plate
Loved the fried rice with avocado and maduros, and the duck dumplings are one of a kind
The sangria was excellent
didn't think much of the decor of the place, doesn't really identify with one or the other or both
Great for dinner of 2, the menu is pricey but they do have a combination option
I have heard about it for years, but was very disappointed when I tried it for lunch twice during the past two months
Service was inept and very slow (had to ask for things they forgot to bring
both visits)
Some of the food is tasty, but frankly I found most of it bland
I don't know whether this restaurant was good and has past its prime, or was never all that good but was just a trendy spot
dunno, just know I'm not going back
I have lived in the city for over 5 years and this is one of my favorite restaurants in New York
The ambiance is great
from the white sheets that hang when you come into the restaurant, to the gorgeous marble communal table in the center of the bottom floor, to the great atmosphere upstairs at the bar
This is the place where you can come with a group of friends sit at the communal table
drink, share your delicious entree's and then head to the bar to mingle
This is also the place where you can have a romantic private dinner upstairs
If you haven' t tried it yet, you have to go to Asia de Cuba!
I am consistently impressed with both the cuisine and service at Asia de Cuba
Every dish I've had has been amazing -- each ingredient complimenting the rest
The portions are also fairly large, so it's also a great value
Servers are friendly and attentive
I've never eaten at the communal table, but I would assume it would be a unique experience
Loved it
Definitely pricey but food was GREAT
If you are going in a group- I would definitely recommend it
Cool atmosphere and the service was great
Never rushed or pressured
Definitely would go back in a second
My boyfriend took me here a couple of weeks ago for my birthday
It was my first time, I'd only been for drinks at Morgan's
The hostess had us wait in the bar while our table was set up and we ordered what had to be the best mojitos in the city
We ordered two appetizers and two entrees and were absolutely stuffed, we couldn't even finish our meals
The portions are very big (I would definitely recommend the beef dumplings and beef short ribs)
The service was a bit rushed and they didn't always clear your plates when you were finished
But I'd definitely go back
We waited an hour for our table, and when we finally sat down it was so cold I had to keep my coat on through out dinner
We were four sitting at a round table for six, we we had to scream across the table to hear each other
Besides that the food was pretty good, some dishes were a bit bland like the Lamb, but the shrimp dish was amazing, and so was the lobster and mash potates
The atmosphere was fun and hip even though it's old for hip standards in this city
Definitely worth trying once - BRING A SWEATER!
This restaurant is very pretty
Everytime I come here, there's always a good looking crowd, the staff is very accomodating, and the food's pretty good
This place is great for meeting friends for drinks and group dining
The food is not extraordinary but I've never been disappointed
I'd definitely come back
I have been here several times and LOVE the food (although its quite pricey, but worth it)
I went with someone who had never been (we arrived an hour late, and they still accomodated us)
The waiter was exceptional -- he gave us great recommendations, and never pressured us to leave (we were there 3 hours on a very busy Saturday night)
The wine kept coming and we were having such a great time, we didn't realize our entree still had not come an hour later
We did not complain since we didn't realize, but our waiter came over and apologized for the delay and presented us with a free appetizer
Although it took us 3 hours to leave, the waiter never complained and came over and chatted with us several times
Again, the food is excellent and the service is great and definitely gets better everytime I go
While I would agree with the initial review that Asia de Cuba isn't really Asian or Cuban in its decor, the food was a nice fusion
I have never been a fan of duck, but I am now a convert after trying the duck ropa vieja
Our food was excellent, the service was great, and I enjoyed the ambiance
However, it is a bit hard to hear
So if you're looking for a romantic spot, try something else
We didn't really wait long for our table at all, maybe 15 minutes
It is on the pricier side no doubt, but I think it's a great wait to indulge once in a while if you can work it
This restaurant was amazing
It should have a higher rating than a 9
2
The setting was beautiful, the salsa music was exciting, the food was amazing
This has to be the most overrated restaurant I have ever been to
The Thai beef salad was not spicy at all, the tuna tartare was just ok at best, and the lobster was overcooked, dry, and flavorless
For such an expensive place, you can find much, much better in Manhattan; heck, you can find much better food for a lot cheaper! The wine is also overpriced and we had to refill our own glasses, etc
, so the service also left a lot to be desired
Why did I waste 60+ bucks for the crappy meal? I've been to many many good restaurants in the city with cheaper price, better ambience/decor, and most importantly EDIBLE food
I don't know why this place is so in, probably because it's pan-asian and ridiculously overpriced
I was in a group of 9 and every single one of them agreed with my opinion
Please don't waste your time and money, there are far better places that you can go to
With all the talk I was expecting more
The food was good, but nothing to write home about
My group of three had reservations for 830 we were seated at 930, which is just unexceptable
The service was fine, out appitizers took forever to come out, and then they dumped the rest of the food on us, without giving us a chance to enjoy our appitizers
The mojitos are good! and you can do better in the city if you want trendy
I went with a party of 5 and we had a GREAT TIME!!!
Our waiter's name was Cody and he was so helpful and suggestive when it came to ordering because it was our first time dining there
The duck and the sliced pork were to Die For!! I would definitely come here again and recommend to others
Especially since the prices were so affordable
--P
S
- Look good when you go to this place because if you come looking sloppy you will definitely feel left out due to so many of the patrons looking DAMN GOOD!!
Total ripoff; and I enjoy fine dining and am willing to spend; but not here
And the attitude of the hosting staff downstairs; they think you, the customer are beneath them; snooooty!!
I just went for drinks while my experience was fine, I could think of other places I'd rather go
No stranger to the scenester places, I did feel slightly uncomfortable here

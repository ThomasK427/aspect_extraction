The Scene At Virgil's, carnivores of every shape and color abandon all caution and happily shovel in as much pungent barbecued meat, pork and chicken as they can stomach
The two-level restaurant is a haven for groups, as evidenced by the occasionally deafening noise level
The Food The spice-infused meat is tenderly cooked, then doused in smoky, tomato-based sauces
Selections include crab cakes, fried catfish, sliced brisket, Georgia chicken fried steak, po' boys, 10 different barbecue platters and intensely piquant Memphis barbecue beans
Balance the meal with airy, softball-sized buttermilk biscuits with honey-butter or thick, velvety collard greens
Virgils is not southern food at its best, but they do have pretty decent macaroni and cheese and palatable greens
I would not recommend the BBQ, most of my friends who had it for lunch said it was just so-so, nothing to rave about but then nothing real negative to say about it either
Virgils is fine but it's authentic only to New Yorkers--and that's not a bad thing
Having grown up with a Southern Grandpa, I know what good, southern food should taste like--this is close but A) It's not as good and B) It's a heafty price to pay for some BBQ, slaw and Hush Puppies
Virgil's was recommended to me by a Manhattan local
It's casual BBQ and they take reservations! The Front Desk and wait service are polite, kind, and patient
The whole atmosphere is very welcoming and they do a good job accomodating people without reservations
There are a lot of good tables, I recommend dining upstairs if you can
Menu is big with many interesting choices
Biscuits and gravy, pulled pork, crab po'boy, popcorn shrimp are all winners
The towels instead of napkins is a cute, casual touch
I ate at Virgil's twice during my last trip to NY and will be sure to return on every trip in the future
This restaurant has the best chicken wings ever
Never ask for cole slaw!
i've never ahd better food bbq or otherwise
the service was unbelieveable, the atmoshere amazin', the quality to die for
we ahd to wait a little, but oh so worth it
i can tell u whenever i'm in the city, i'll make sure i go
virgil's has a customer for life
To start, upon arriving at Virgil's at the hostess stand, the waitstaff was arguing over who would have to wait another table
Not so inviting
The food itself was mediocre at best, and does not resemble any BBQ I have eaten in the south
The cheese grits particularly were awful - tasted proecessed or old or both
Serivce was so-so
The waiter could have come by once or twice to see if we needed another drink
Oh, and if you want water, you may have to ask several times for it
Overall, don't waste your time, money or calories
I only had lunch there because my coworker works around Times Square
I live in the city and usually never eat at or around Times Square
So we ate there because we had to
I cannot understand why would anyone give this restaurant a good review for its food? Best BBQ in the city? I didn't know pork ribs could taste so bad
I am sorry: not recommended
specifically, the links
also, the lemonade
also, peach cobbler
eat in or take out, the food counts
recommended!
Overall, Virgil's is the best BBQ that I've been to in NY
I should point out that this isn't really saying much -- not only is NY not known for BBQ, the proper cooking methods can't be used as they would be in violation of fire codes
Recommended is the brisket and the ribs
The pulled pork seems to fluctuate in terms of quality and can be a gamble
As for sides, the BBQ beans are tasty, but the cole slaw is very disappointing
I would not recommend eating in, as the place is touristy, noisy and the service is hurried and of varied competence
But it makes for a fine take-out meal
I took my girl to Virgils based on a recommendation
I found that the seating was crampy
I mean elbow to elbow crampy on the first floor
That turned me off the most
The the food was average and pricey
I'd say this is a place to chill and have a meal if you're shopping in Manhattan, but not a place to go if you want to make an impression
This is a place to avoid if you are a New Yorker or a savvy tourist
On ouor visit, our reservation was ignored and then we were asked to move from our seats at the bar, where we were told to wait, because we were not drinking enough
The food was not good either
Virgil's is overrated, overpriced, and really only designed for tourists
There are far better, more authentic BBQ joints in NYC
Virgil's is a touristy restaurant located in Times Square
Our first visit we enjoyed excellent pulled pork BBQ, decent ribs, tender brisket, baked beans, and hushpuppies
On our last visit, the food headed down south and then some
The pulled pork was fatty, gritty, and was dry (on top of being served lukewarm)
It had to be some of the worst BBQ we've ever tried
The brisket was overcooked and fatty
The hushpuppies remain the best we've tasted, but the rest of the meal, including fake tasting macaroni and cheese will ensure that we won't return in the near future
I've been a fan of Virgil's since 1997, and have found that as long as you avoid the traditional NY off nights for restaurants(Monday and Tuesday nights), you can get excellent barbeque at what I consider reasonable prices
They've created the definitive barbeque wings, smoked then grilled in tangy sauce (none of that uncooked sauce on plain wings stuff here); their ribs are excellent dry rub style, with a rich smokey flavor falling off the bone
The pulled pork and brisket are also delicious; but can be dry on the off nights
Real Southern cole slaw and other sides round off the meal, and yes, real iced tea, not that stuff from the tap
Take it from someone who's shopped around for a decade: You'd have to travel below the Mason Dixon to find better barbeque
Sauce on appetizers was too tangy and somewhat bitter
I asked three times before ordering for Lemonade with no ice and finally got one WITH ICE
The Ribs were uneatable, the Mac and Cheese awful and my friend had tasteless catfish
I cannot understand why this and other restaurants get such high ratings
I finally went to Virgil's after seeing it on the top of CitySearch's Best BBQ lists for a few years now
I was very disappointed
It's not that good at all
The ribs were average
The crabcake Po' Boy was quite bad
The ribs I've had at Brother Jimmy's and The Hog Pit are much better as are The Hog Pit's side orders
Maybe Virgil's has gone downhill or maybe I went on a bad night, but I don't expect to be going back
Virgil's is a real find in Manhattan
I grew up in Tennessee and know good BBQ
The pulled pork and chicken sandwiches are great along with the ribs and many side dishes
It is a great place for take out lunch or big groups
It is often crowded with tourist and noisy, so you have to focus on the delicious food
Reasonable prices too for the location
For really good southern food you must go to Virgil's
I have lived in NY for 2 years and this is the first restaurant that has truely good southern food and drinks! The knock me off the porch tea was fabulous! Everyone should be lucky enough to experince Virgil's! Meat and greens are seasoned just right! Cornbread is perfect! Must try!
Fun, easy, good food, and fun
I loved Virgil's
After stumbling on it while in the area, my girlfriend and I have made it our #1 stop for lunch or dinner when in NYC
The environment is upbeat, the service very quick, and the food is amazing
all for a very reasonable price
I can't speak for the locals, but I don't see how anyone could pass Virgil's by! A great place to enjoy, where they make everybody feel at home
I have been frequenting Virgils for two years
I'm an NYer from the south and this is the only place I've found to get my fix
I'm really dissapointed by the reviews posted

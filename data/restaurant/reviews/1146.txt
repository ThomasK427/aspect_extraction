A full bar with signature cocktails is also featured
Recently stopped by for a Saturday lunch
Restaurant's design makes the place look larger than it is and gives it an airy feeling
I noticed the dj stand and a large bar area with a drink specials menu
I guess at nights and weekends this place becomes a trendy bar/restaurant
Menu is consists of mostly Thai and Japanese specialties
Service was quick and the food was tasty
Tasted the Duck curry, Chicken in green curry and the crystal seafood dumplings
Also shrimp tempura and udon/soba noodle broth looked very good from a nearby table
Portions are quiet large for under $10
00 so order accordingly, you can get pretty full afterwards
Overall it is very good value and the food is fresh and tasty
I wouldn't go for a late night but I would certainly go back for lunch or early dinner in Chelsea
This place is unbelievably awful
Not only did we wait too long to sit without anyone greeting us or asking how many we were
We were placed at a dirty table that swiveled uncontrollably and made it difficult to eat
The Sushi was smelly and the rolls not well wrapped
The service was horrendous, not only did the waiter take an hour to remember we ordered drinks, we were rushed to eat and get out so they could seat the next party
And it wasn't only us, as we were leaving I could hear several other disgruntled customers complaining about being asked to leave so others could be seated
That is not way to run a successful restaurant and expect customers to return
I will NEVER eat there again!!!!!!!
I've lived in Chelsea for eight years and this is the best ever
First of all, every other place in this neighborhood is overpriced
Nooch is the first place I've seen that is UNDERpriced
The Thai side of the menu is just perfect
The decor is spectacular, the waitstaff is superfriendly (and cute), the crowd is trueblood NYC, and the drinks are creatively delicious
Bring friends or a date, and they'll be impressed
I was excited to hit NOOCH, the new noodle place across from my apartment
A female friend and I showed up for lunch and were seated right away
We continued to sit for ten minutes
The Hello Kitty childrens decor getting increasingly on my nerves
Finally someone asked to take our order
Then the manager asked if we would please move to another seat
WHAT? They wanted to move two tables together to accommodate four chirpy cell phone talking LongJersey chicks
So we moved
Finally our order came, Ramen noodle something with shrimp
Yuck
$
27 in college but $10 at NOOCH
The shrimp weren't cleaned properly, not de-veined and had the heads on them
It has been open for several months now and the only crowd that fills the place is the most un-edgiest of BT transients
Everyone, stop patronizing NOOCH to allow a better restaurant to take its place
!
Went for lunch recently, staff seemed frantic
Sat at the bar with a friend, once dish came, the other took ten minutes to arrive
Asked numerous times where the food was, staff did not go back into the kitchen to check until it was clear that a mistake was made
No offer to comp the dish or discount the check
Food was ok, I still prefer republic
The raging techno music in the background seems out of place
i tried nooch for the first time today and had a great experience
the salty, miso based broth of the shrimp ramen is incredibly delicious
the bartender, jasmine, is super nice
great atmosphere and comfortable bar stools
i ordered take-out so the broth and extras came seperately
the shrimp were completely intact, heads, legs and all
quite fun to take apart
i'll definitely be back
Once I got past the very 80s face poster in the entrance, we waited for a seat
No where to stand really, since the space is fairly tight
The fried tofu was nasty
The sushi we picked was gross
and the THAI noodles we each ordered were sloppy at best
The service was poor, the food below average (SPICE up the street is much better, but be weary of service there as well)
Overall, dissapointed
It's also CASH ONLY
Went there as an experiment thinking we would end up not liking it, but was pleasantly surprised
We were seated promptly, perhaps due to us being there early as we noticed it got quite busy about half an hour later
The food turned out to be nice and also not expensive as the decor might suggest
Overall a fun place (at least on an early weekday)
My friends and I went there a couple of weeks ago
The food was decent and the price was reasonable
But it was defnitely not worth the 45-minute wait we had to endure
(The waitor, of course, told us it would be 20 minutes
) You can have food five times better for half the price at a really good restaurant in Chinatown
I wasn't impressed at all
After being frustrated the last few weeks by Nooch not being open at lunch, and by their lack of delivery or take-out (they say that they'll have delivery soon), we finally went for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised
The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the HUGE portions - by noodle soup could have fed both my husband and myself
Our soups were excellent - very flavorful and delicious - and we had some sushi that was also very good
The neighborhood could use a good noodle shop, and we'll definitely be going back
OK-so this place looks stunning from outside
It's a definite eye catcher, with it's bright green lighting and oversized picture of a woman's face to welcome you in to it's slightly cool/slightly awful decor
My friends and I were willing to give it a shot, because it just looked so enticing from the outside
We were very underwhelmed
The food has sloshy, poorly thrown together look and quality- and the plastic plates reminded me of what my sister uses to feed her two young babies, rather than what should be used to serve in a trendy restaurant
I was very disappointed overall
Last time I was lucky enough to get a Mango choux, it's plain delicious!
The best crispy cream puffs! Brand new Japanese bakery serves
The place is so cute
They also serve Kona Coffee
This place has such a great brunch
Good service, nice atmosphere, and delicious food! I highly recommend
The Scene Opened by the owners of Oceana and Molyvos, the Blakely Hotel's ground floor restaurant feature buttery leather booths, stone walls, exposed beams, and starched linen-topped tables
The crowd consists of older business diners and hotel guests
Service, though warm and welcoming at the door, can be neglectful and absent at the table
The Food The Italian menu includes salads, antipasti, pastas and entrees
Dishes are designed with restraint, so as to let the ingredients themselves shine
This works in dishes like perfectly grilled octopus, accented with bits of lemon
But from the beet ravioli, tender and savory yet missing any hint of its promised Gorgonzola, to tagliatelle tossed with a sauceless bolognese, essentially ground meat and pasta barely held together by the thinnest of pan juices, flavors fall short
Entrees, including fennel-accented monkfish cooked until dry, and suckling pig buried in an oversalty gravy, are equally disappointing
Abboccato seems to be one of the best kept secrets in NYC

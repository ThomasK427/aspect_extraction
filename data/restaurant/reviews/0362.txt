My husband and I had a 9PM reservation, but did not get seated till 9:40
We did receive a complementary drink from the hostess though
Their menu is definitely interesting, but once we ordered, it was another hour till the food started to arrive (with 20 minute intervals between the dishes)
When it did, the portions were truly miniscule, the smallest pieces of sushi and appetizers I've ever seen
We left at 12:30 still hungry, having wasted three and a half hours and the sum of money that would have bought us a dinner at Nobu
If you want to get a great sushi dining experience, go to Nobu, Bond Street Sushi or Blue Ribbon Sushi instead, or even Tomoe
I also agree with other reviewers, I think the most positive reviews are phony, posted by owners of Jewel Bako
If you want big portions, go to Tomoe
They serve nauseatingly large, but fresh fish
Jewel Bako is for sushi aesthetes who appreciate freshness, subtle differences in variety, and accessible omakase options
Big is NOT ALWAYS BETTER
i have been to the greatest sushi places from NY to LA, and i can say jewel bako was my most pleasurable experience
i did the sashimi omakase meal, which is probably one of the cheapest omakases in the city with the freshest selections
the service is EXCELLENT, the fish is impressive, and the restaurant's decor is simple, yet stunning
jewel bako makes a memorable night
I may not be a celebrity, but I have been to Japan -- and this is nothing like a genuine sushi experience there
All form and no function can best describe the pretentious service and ridiculously small portions
And when have you ever heard the words upgrade and courtesy to describe sushi? Only here, where we waited 40 minutes for our reservation, and almost 3 more hours until our sushi was served
This was attributed to the hand-cut quality
Odd that Bobby Flay, the TV chef seated at the next table, got his order in record time
And at over $500 for 4 diners -- it was about $125 an hour for one of the most irritating, unsatisfying and uncomfortable dining experiences ever
The fish was OK, but I can't believe the owners don't meet in the back room to laugh at the poor dopes up front
Absolutely awful
Our party of four was finally seated at 9:30 for an 8:30 reservation
The place is tiny, cramped, and brightly lit, with uncomfortable seating
Teenie weenie overpriced appetizers were served at an agonizingly slow pace, one at a time 30 minutes between each
Dinner (sushi) was finally served at around 11:15
But the waiter had forgotten a third of our order
A downtown clown of a maitre d told us we were being upgraded to fresh wasabi to make up for it
He later offered 3 pieces of courtesy sushi for our bad experience
By the end of the evening, it was all we could do to keep from assaulting him
Yes, the sushi is pretty good, but dining here is so unpleasant, you won't care
This emperor is just plain naked
Best fish in the city
Chef is masterful in his presentation of all dishes and takes pride in his food
Jewel Bako is a dining experience and not ment for those looking for 10 minute sushi
The sake selection is without comparison
Service is unmatched
I rank Jewel Bako as 1 of the 5 best Japanese restaurants in the U
S
We had a wonderful meal here
The yellowtail appetizer was perfect; it came with four types of yellowtail, from lean to very fatty, which complimented each other perfectly
The freshwater eel was among the best I've ever had; it rivalled the freshwater eel at Sushi Yasuda
The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful, and our waiter gave us excellent recommendations for entrees
They also have a very extensive sake menu
Although we didn't order dessert, we got complimentary lychee sorbet, which was delicious and refreshing--a perfect way to end a sushi meal
One more note -- those of you who complained about the portions being too small, please just cut it out
Real Japanese sushi is *supposed* to be small enough to be eaten in one bite
If you want disgusting, huge, fake, sushi, stay at nasty restaurants like Yama and leave the real sushi for people who understand it
This is real sushi, small delicate and flavorful
For the person who complained about the appetizers being delicate, obviously you've never been to japan or had real japanese food which focuses on subtle flavors and texture
Yes the wait is dreafully long, the place feels a bit uncomfortable to talk in with your dining partner, but the food is excellent none the less
If you want fake gaijin sushi goto jeollado, sandobe, or daikichi sushi
The husband/wife team who runs Jewel Bako make the experience a personal and educational one, even when the food falls short of the high expectations with which one enters
The $75 tasting menu features seafood which is both unusual and powerfully fresh, but the chef's appetizers which preceed it like sesame flavored tile fish with raw vegetable salad and japanese spiced flan with seafood were unbalanced and far too delicate on the palate (although the tuna tartare with avocado is a standout)
Pretty ambiance, nice wines by the glass and interesting sakes coupled with outstanding personal service will keep patrons coming, but for the price New York offers better Japanese options
This is an unusually lovely, artistic, exquisitely delicious experience for those who want the very best and can afford it
I recommend the full chef's tasting menu and the sake tasting, which will run about $165 with tax and tip
The restaurant is tiny and intimate, the owners/hosts are charming--you feel like a guest in their home
I have been everywhere in New York, and this is a truly different experience
This place was the worst
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too
Extraordinary food in a spectacular place
Warm and knowledgeable hosts/owners present dazzling fish and delicious sakes
Go
Now!
Tiny jewel box of a restaurant
The husband-and-wife team who run the place are terriffic, and the sushi is inventive and extraordinary
Absolutely gorgeous jewel-box sized restaurant with wonderfully friendly service, exquisite dishes, delectable sushi
A romantic dinner spot for sushi lovers
The Greatset Sushi Restaurant ever decor is very cool satff are the best this a all around good place
Only a little expensive
We've been to this restaurant several times, but on our last visit, we ate at the sushi bar, which was a great experience
The selection of fresh fish is incredible
We loved the chopped jack mackerel and spotted sardine
We also got an amazing salmon that is only available three weeks every year
The sushi chef, Kazu, was amazing
We have another reservation for next week and we can't wait to go back for more!
By far the best SUSHI One could have original, fresh plated well
Service the way it should be for all in the food business
But you cant get a reservation, dont let that stop you a must-visit-experience
KINO is a great addition to Dumbo- hip chick, and certainly not for the dull
Atmosphere is upbeat and chic
Fantastic party spot, as it can seat both upstairs and down for a fantastic view
The food is exceptional and service very friendly
Our party felt like a home away from home
Ignore the jealous or the dull critics- this is our favorite new spot!
KINO, WITH ONE OF THE BEST VIEWS IN BROOKLYN, HAS A NEW UPSTAIRS LOUNGE APPOINTED WITH SOFAS AND LOUNGE CHAIRS AND TABLES FOR INTIMATE GROUPS AND CELEBRATIONS
ENJOY THE AMBIANCE
I went on a Sunday night and it was quiet
But that's what I like on a Sunday night, someplace to go that is quiet
Great view of the city, very spacious, I'm thinking of having a party there
The map that this site is showing (as of June 3, 2002) is wrong - you'll never find Kino if you follow this! Type the address into Mapquest and you'll get an accurate map
The real location is in Dumbo, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges
Main Street runs perpendicular to the River and dead-ends at the parking lot, and Kino is right on the corner - hard to miss
Very cool place, great ambience, almost TOO hip, as if they're trying to create a SOHO type place (which I hate) in Brooklyn
But they pull it off
Warning: this place has been 3 different restaurants in the last 3 years, so they're going to need your business to survive
But the food is below par for the price

You could not want for nothing
This place is the real deal
great food
This is such a wonderful restaurant - it has really old school Italian - and a wonderful feeling when you walk through the door
Also, the cheese and meat antipasto they bring to your table with bread is delish!
They make me wait in line and Mad, QZ and Luk get their food before me and they finish eating and I am still waiting
Then they give me the wrong dish! I order in Chinese
why can't they inderstand?
The food is good every meal is mouth watering good, try it I worked on Wall Street for 17yr and this Restaurant as been cooking the best chinese food, you can get in downtown manhattan, you can have your dish anyway you want it
Ho Yip, down in the basement of the subway entrance next to the Century 21 building, serves by far the best chinese food I have ever tasted
I have no idea where the other reviewer went - sounds like a nightmare
A group of us from office go over to Ho Yip about once a week - the food is so good, it's hard not to get a crave on it
Our favorites are squid with black bean sauce, buddha's delight, chicken and eggplant
Don't feel restricted to the menu - they can prepare almost anything, so long as you tell them what you want - and off the shelf or a-la-carte, it'll cost you less than $5
Instead of the house soup, try a better one
In Short Tribeca locals jam the long rows of small, tightly-packed tables in this popular brunch spot
The all-day breakfast menu boasts a long list of casual classics: Scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon and the like
A Midwestern streak--evidenced in the melting of fresh strawberries into the butter--ennobles the signature french toast
With bottomless cups of coffee, it's the kind of place where regulars linger
My husband and I went for Saturday brunch where we waited for 10 minutes to get seated even through there were several empty tables
After placing our order we waited for 35 minutes until we realized that three tables who had been seated after us had already received their orders
According to the waiter the kitchen was behind on pancakes and it would only be another 5 minutes
15 minutes later we noticed yet another table getting their order - which included pancakes and was exactly what my husband had ordered
We then were unable to get the waiter's attention, did not get our order, and ended up leaving the restaurant on an empty stomach after having been there for over an hour
Ordered through sorporate web site dinner worth USD 500 ( for the team)
Although we received message confirming dinner will be delivered within 35-50 minutes, it arrived after 1
5hrs
Crabcakes which were suppose to come with sauce on the side and order of wilted greens and four cheese macaroni were burnt, covered with sauce and served with some unidentifiable bun ( no macaroni at all)
Save yourself money and eat some place else
i came here for sunday brunch around 2pm
the place is small but we were lucky that that we didnt have to wait, though a line quickly formed behind us
i chose the farmhouse special 2 eggs, turkey sausage, cheese grits, and a biscuit ($9)
the portions were large and the food was satisfying
the big, warm, square biscuit with the sweet strawberry butter was especially good
the turkey sausage was definitely on the dry side (ill choose bacon next time)
cheese grits were standard though not especially flavourful (the potatoes looked better)
my bf had the kitchenette special (eggs, bacon, cheese, on a biscuit) which he said was very good
there was only 1 waitress and a busboy working so service wasnt great
ill probably come again for the biscuits
Very small, quaint, neighborhood place for breakfast with the locals
Good food, good value, great coffee, nice selection of the usual breakfast fare as well as some unique offerings
It's always a solid backup so when we wake up in the mornings, too lazy to travel too far uptown we are happy to have Kitchenette close
The french fries are soggy, the service is so/so and while it looks like a cute little homestyle cafe you'd find in SF, the food is below average
It's not bad and it's not great, but it's better than a diner and the ambiance is nice--and it's not expensive
I've been here a couple times now
When I get there I'm excited by the possibilities laid out in the menu - breakfast until 4 pm, macaroni and other comfort food - but my expectations have been too high
Today's country breakfast was a poor choice on my part
The eggs were runny, the turkey sausage was dry and almost brick-like and the potatoes were odd
I don't recommend this dish
The person I ate with, however, chose the Friday lunch special - fried catfish sandwich
The catfish has been recommended and because the price is right I'll probably try again another time
A nice thing was that, even though a line was starting to form for a table, we weren't rushed out
If you don't want to have to wait for a table at lunch time get there before 12:30
Went there for a Saturday breakfast
Cutesy but very cramped quarters
The food was for the most part a disappointment
While the omelet and toast were excellent, the pancakes were very disappointing
They were dry, grainy, and no matter how much syrup was used to cover them up they were terrible
The breakfast potatoes were not much better
They were served southwest style, and were reminiscent of airline food in the 1970's
Unless you want eggs, keep looking around if your craving good pancakes
I usually like to have pancakes or french toasts when I brunch
This is a cute place and I decided to have pancakes there
Unfortunately, they were not in the image of the place
They were dry and heavy
I didn't think Kitchenette was anything special
I went for dinner last night and I had their catfish with vegetables
The food was decent, but I probably wouldn't go back for dinner
Great food, always well prepared
Creative combinations of ingredients and flavors - especially the omelettes and sandwiches
Laid back country-style atmosphere
Friendly staff
Waiter was very blase, never asked how things were, spoke maybe two words
Busboys and service though was excellent despite mute waiter
Appetizer and dinner had way too much butter/butter sauce
a sauteed calamari app and seafood risotto dinner
Choc mousse dessert was very good
Need better beer selection for us non-wine drinkers
, though tried a good italian beer
Very reasonable for NYC Restaurant
Wife had bland mixed salad with oil and vinegar, and very good pasta with eggplant
Including One beer two sodas +tax/tip
$86
Would re-visit
Garden area was nice, not as nice as thought it would be, but much better than typical restaurant dining room
Service was quick, but not as rushed as some reviews make it out to be
Sorry, but I just don't find this slightly better than average luncheonette hardly enough to get excited about
Came by on a Sunday and sat at the counter (which overlooks the really horrendously sloppy back counter)
Eggs (scrambled) were fine, bacon thin and greasy, and potatoes way overcooked with onions and green pepper reduced to a morass
Service was okay but slightly on the dippy side
I had to almost use pliers to pull out information from the counter server: Do the eggs come with toast answer If you want, Does that mean it is extra, Not necessarily
What kind of totally unnecessary and stupid verbal joust was this
Best brunch I have had
Tiny, but very worth the wait to be seated
I love this place
I just went on a Sunday and only had to wait 10 minutes
Our server was so helpful - he went out of his way to make us happy
It's cramped and you are elbow to elbow with other tables, but that's part of the charm unless you're sitting next to a jerk
Highly recommend the goat cheese omelet!
This is a great little brunch place, but plan on waiting up to and over an hour for a table on weekends

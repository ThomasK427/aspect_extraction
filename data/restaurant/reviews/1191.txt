The food made up for any shortcomings
Will return!
I've been to Barmarche many times
I was there on Friday evening and had a terrible experience
Our waiter was RUDE! I can't remember his name, but he's the one that sold a screenplay
We sat in the corner table right under the heater
The restaurant decided to turn the heat on and the air was blowing right in our faces
We asked our waiter if he can turn it off or lower the heat
Instead of accommodating us, he immediately put on an attitude
His exact words Well you can sit there and argue with me or I can move you to another table
We were shocked by his comment because we had asked him nicely
He repeated his comment a few more times
We were tempted to leave, but decided to finish our meal
Needless to say, his tip was very low and we won't go back again
So glad i stumbled upon this place! Fabulous atmosphere, perfect lighting, beautiful interior design - the owners certainly put a lot of love and a lot of thought into this place
The food was great (the spiced crab soup and scallop appetizer were my favorites), the drinks creative and delicious, our waitress was extra attentive, friendly and knowledgeble
Can't wait to come back for more
an overall great dining experience
the atmosphere is hip yet not pretentious
the service was great and on cue
last but not least, food and drink are fantastic
i have eaten at barmarche several times and each time has been enjoyable
the tuna tartare, pizzetta with truffle oil, and steak frites are all great
however, my personal favorite is their late night dining menu
the hamburger with garlic pomme frites hits the spot after a late night out on the town
it is simply among the best in the city
This is one stop in NYC dining not to be missed, whether for a romantic dinner, or for an intimate group setting
The chef's creative fusions are delectable and some of my favorites at a recent tasting included oysters with wild american caviar, aged sirloin with homemade blue cheese, and scallop ceviche with pickled grapes in a port reduction
The friendly staff encourage a warm dining experience and overall service is impeccable
Drinks are fabulous too including my favorite: watermelon lemonade
This place does not disappoint!
barmarche is an amazing place to get great cocktails, and fantastic food
its a complete experience for all in your party--from those who want great, and unique, drinks, to those who relish in ecletic cuisine
with the new menu, and new chef, who has created dishes from the great regions of the world, you are sure to have a wonderful experience at this SOHO gem
i highly recommend the scallops ceviche, the refreshing watermelon and feta salad, and any one of the delectable desserts available
this is the place to be whether its late night or for a fabulous brunch with your friends
it is also a superb place for a date, and if that is the case have the brazillian sangria
A great spot for a romantic date or dinner with friends
The drinks are amazing and the food is great as well
There's something for everyone on the menu and the service is fantastic
The atmosphere is charming and the bar is a great place to meet for a drink after work or relax at on the weekends!
Barmarche has an amazing atmosphere - crisp white everything, candlelight dancing, drippy chandeliers get a downtown feel when wrapped in Lucite boxes
it's a visual feast to say nothing yet of the delicious food
We started with the lemonade-watermelon-vodka cocktail on the summer drink menu that we unanimously decided should be renamed summer in a glass
It's that good and reminiscent of lazy outdoor summer days
On to a 9 course tasting menu - amazing presentation, description and just beautiful flavors
Black West Indies Tuna with Vanilla Basil topped it for me!   Barmarche has a great vibe, is beautiful, unpretentious and delicious
I went to barcarche with a friend recently and we both enjoyed it
Great menu, but the space and the service were also big selling points
Definitely a good little romantic and fun spot to keep in rotation
Highly recommend it!
barmarche is my new favorite! i have been with a large group of friends for dinner and have stopped in for breakfast and lunch as well
the food is unbelievable and the service is top-notch (and we all know how hard it is to find great service at a hip restaurant)
and the cocktails - the best list i have seen in a long time! try the skate (it is brilliant) and the ceviche with cherry salsa and avocado puree (the perfect combination of flavors)
Drinks - fantastic
Tasty as promised with a healthy dose of alcohol
However, food, was another story
Everyone at the table had a good experience but me, twice
I ordered octopus salad (in the salad section), but in fact, I think it was the same squid used for the fried calamari - chewy pieces of squid with onions
Needless to say, it was sent back
In its place I ordered mussles, which were OK, however, each one tasted different making me think perhaps some were fresher than others
Garlic french fries were tasty, though could've been in the frier about 20 seconds longer to retain crispiness
The skate was delicious and perfectly crispy in its broth and accompanied by fiddlehead ferns and ramps (both in season only a short time)
The fettucine with braised meat and tomato fondue got a thumbs up (and plate-licking) from the guys
went to this great spot last night and really fell for it! wonderful vibe, beautiful decor - - soft interior with lots of candlight and cool artisitic touches
and the food was awesome (tuna tartare and pizzeta were expectional
) well priced too
staff was warm and down to earth giving barmarche a neighborhood feel (even it it's not your 'hood
) can't wait to go back
this is a great find!!!
I went to barmarche last with a first date and was happily surprised as it was my first time there
the lighting, music and general ambience was pleasing
we had the back left corner table which is especially private
the service was amiable and efficient and the food was basically a spin on bistro classics with a few new twists thrown in
overall a very good experience
Definitely a restaurant must
Since my first visit two weeks ago, I've been back three more times
And indeed, the food and cocktails are consistently wow factors, as are the charming and cute staff
The vibe is always hopping and though barmarche is stylish, it manages to be so without the pretense
Fantastic dishes I've had include the tuna tartar, the mushroom pizzetta, steak (awesome garlic fries!) and shrimp risotto
The desserts are awesome as well, especially the chocolate mousse
Trust me, this is the place to go to spoil your senses - without ruining your budget
I have read many good reviews for this spot and was utterly disappointed that my experience did not match the praise-it was almost as if the owners wrote the reviews themselves
Although the atmosphere and ambiance were nice, the attitude of the staff and food itself were definately lacking
Our waiter messed up our order on a number of occasions and when confronted on it, he laughed and blamed it on another table
The calamari was good, but where in this city can't you find decent calamari? I went with a friend who had been previously who says that they cant seem to decide on the size of the portions and that the specials were identical upon both visits
With all the competition of restaurants in this area, don't see Barmarche lasting too much longer
If your planning anything for the future, this is not an intelligent choice!
Barmarche is a must! The cocktail list is amazing in its creativity
The food is great and the menu has something for everyone
Perfect for a date or a late meal with friends
I have been several times now and have not been disappointed
I went to barmarche last night on the recomendation of a friend and found it to be a surprisingly enjoyabel experience
the staff was very inviting, the food was quite tasty and well presented and the overall feeling of the place was cozy and romantic
In Short The minimalist space, covered in light wood and little else, looks solely designed to cook and serve steaming bowls of ramen
A long bar peeks into the open kitchen, and diners sit thigh-to-thigh on wooden stools
Noodle dishes such as Momofuku ramen, oxtail soup and kimchi stew come garnished with veggies
The steamed buns--pork, shitake or chicken--are a popular starter
Neighborhood devotees wash it all down with inexpensive beer and sake
For the long line of customers waiting outside its doors at 10:30 p

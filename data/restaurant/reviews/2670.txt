the crust and everything else on the pugsley's menu tastes stale and old, you'll need a whole lot of Sal's oregano to make the food palatable
If you haven't had Mike's famous sicilian pizza, then you haven't had real pizza
It's an American invention and therefore done right in America, in the Bronx, at Mike's
There's really not much more that can be said
I'll simply tell you this: anytime we have an excuse to go through (or at least relatively close to) the Bronx, we stop for a slice of Mike's
JUST GO
I live a few blocks away from this restaurant, so when I arrive home late from work, I make it a point to stop in
Why? Well, I've eaten pizza at dozens of restaurants throughout New York City, but none compares to the delicious pizza served at Mike's
No skimping here
The slices are ample, particularly Sicillian slices--laden with thick fresh cheese and tomato sauce
And what a bargain--only $1
50 per slice
Simply, the best pizza in New York City, bar none
Giovanni's is my Arthur Avenue staple
When I want to go out have a nice simple dish, Giovanni's is the place
The only downside is that the decor is average, so do not expect anything fancy, and the service can be ditzy at times
Great pasta dishes and chicken dishes
Service, food, character all were terrific
But the people went above and beyond to make an out-of-towner feel welcome -- part of the family actually
It's the best pizza outside a 50 km region that surrounds Naples
Baked in a brick oven, topped with sweet pomodori sauce, fresh mozzarella, and fresh basil, the pizza is worth the trip to Arthur Avenue
Is a very friendly restaurant
They serve good food and the waitreses are very friendly Is a Domican ownership rest
Newly renovated look adds a great look to the community
The food leaves alot to be desired
Overall, the place has good variety, but lackes in quality and dedication
10 (males and females)coworkers and myself went on Wednesday to a free margarita tasting night and they were the best margarita's we've had in a very long time
The service the bar tender gave us was excellent
We did not have to wait longer than 2min (if that) for our next drink order
I highly recommend Lucy's to anyone who's looking for prompt service at the bar and magnificent tasting drinks
These other places get all the fame, but Emilio's is the place to go if you want a real slice of pizza
I've never eaten anything but pizza here (get my Calzone's from Nick's on Gun Hill Rd), but that alone makes this place great
My girlfriend and I have been there many times
It is good to have a place that prepares very good chinese food and sushi
Mix and match
you will not be disappointed
THIS IS THE BEST DELI IN MORRIS PARK SECTION OF THE BRONX
Crosby Pizza stop is not the place to go for atmosphere but the pizza is world class
If you just want to experience one of the best pizza-gasms of your life, check this one out on your way to Orchard Beach or just if you don't mind a fairly long ride on the 6 train to the Boogey Down Bronx
If you head to this pizza shop, order the Sicilian pizza, very tasy, good cheese and sauce
The boys will treat you well!
The pizza is made with a thin, crispy crust and is overall the best slice I've ever had in the Bronx
Thin crust and great sauce make this the best pizza anywhere
Nothing fancy here - this is a straight up pizzeria
Pizza, calzones and Italian Ices
The calzones are deep fried
They are so good
This is a family run business
Nice neighborhood atmosphere
I love this restaurant
The food is great, just do not try to go on a Saturday night after 5pm
The ambiance is great, there is valet parking (for a tip) and if you want something nice but aren't in the mood to hit Manhattan, it's a good spot
I hate that they don't accept plastic
Cash only
I've been coming to FJ's for a long time now, celebrating birthdays, graduations, promotions, engagements, new hair color you name it! And after it had expanded the service became lacking and the food wasn't as good, someone noticed and made changes
It's a friendly place, where you may have to wait for a table, but you'll have good food at a good price
The only problems are their no reservations for parties under 10 policy and they don't accept Credit/Debit cards
The food was great--the service ok-- the portions were huge but no credit cards! CASH ONLY!
The food is outstanding
The portions are so big, one pasta dish can feed two people
I think the owners must have read the other reviews, and acted upon them
Our experience was 100% positive
The food was outrageous and plentiful
The service was friendly and accomodating
Though the restaurant is large, it has a cozy atmosphere
The crowd is real food lovers
If I lived close to this restaurant I'd be obese because the portions are huge and the food is delicious
On a Saturday night we arrived at about 9p
We were given a beeper and sent over to the large bar, filled with Sopranos and baseball memorabilia
We only waited about 15 minutes
There was a wedding going on
But you wouldn't have known/heard it unless you went to the rest room, which was across the hall from the banquet room
It was our first visit
Recommended by a relative who knows good food, too
We'll be back!
Really folks
There are just too many REAL Italian restaurants in NYC, that this place strikes me as a huge joke played on honest patrons
Why do people have to submit to disorganized teenage management, zero customer service and garganutan portions of paste and oil? To rub elbows with the Bat Boy from the Yankees' dugout? Gimme a break
I won't call them restauranteurs, but the impressario owners (think P
T
Barnum) of Pine Tavern have to be laughing all the way to the bank
Frankie and Johnnie's has always been a restaurant serving delicious food to the neighborhood, but on August 14, 2003, during the blackout, they proved to be a great neighbor and friend to the community as well
During the chaos of the day, the owner opened up his days and feed us, the tired and stress weary community, for FREE
F J is truly a guardian angle to the community, serving us some of the best Italian food in NY with a pinch of love
Thanks!!!
Good food, huge portions, cheap prices
so what is wrong with this picture
? The service and wait time for a table is less than desired to say the least, so don;t go too hungry!! However, when you are finally seated and served, the food is very good, and the tab will not give you agita
Plus, chances are, you will have lunch the next day with your leftovers
One of the best bargins in NYC for sure
It was my mother's 52nd birthday and my sister and I decided to take her to this restaurant! It was recommended by a couple of friends
But I have to say that the service could have been better
My parents are from Ecuador and were not sure what certain Italian plates were! The waiter could have done a better job of explaining them instead of answering in a rude manner as if we were idiots for asking! Food was good, but I hope the next time we get a different waiter with a different attitude!
The food is awesome, portions large, and the prices reasonable
I agree with the previous posting, that with the renovation it has lost some of the little neighborhood atmosphere
On my last visit we arrived around 9 on a Saturday, and although it wasn't crowded, the waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her, forgot bread, drinks, etc
One of the regular guy waiters picked up on it, and helped out
The parking guys outside were great, they even let us park the HD on the sidewalk in front
Every New Yorker knows that if it is good enough for the Yankees, it is good enough for us
The light-hearted atmospheren leads to good conversation and a highly pleasant dining experience

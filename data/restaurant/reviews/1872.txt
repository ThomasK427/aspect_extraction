My kids have occasionally visited Dojo when they needed to grab a quick and inexpensive bite, so when we were all in the city today, I decided to try it
What a mistake
No wonder it is so economical - they wouldnt have the nerve to charge a penny more
The chumus was horrid, brown rice dry, chicken cutlet sandwich was hardly edible
Service was indifferent
We asked for water 3 times before they gave it to us, and even the fountain soda was flat
The only redeeming quality was the carrot/tahini salad dressing - other than that - thumbs down
Oh, and the ladies room was FILTHY
I go to DoJo's all the time
they have the best french onion soup I have tasted anywhere
and the fired calamari
well they don't try to gip you on it that's for sure
it's not a fancy place, but it's cozy and the food is great
The soy burger dinner is the best deal in town -- brown rice, a salad with sprouts and the BEST ginger dressing and a soyburger patty (which tastes like nothing else I've ever experienced) for $3
75!!! It's totally filling, mostly healthy and very delicious for less then 2 slices of pizza
Incredible!
It's cheap and everyone eats here upon first moving to New York
That said, it's often less than clean and more than claustrophobic and the food quality varies, though on good days, it's quite respectable
This location tends to attract NYUers -- Dojo East is not better, but funkier and more fun
where have you been? I have been at te Village MA
I of course loved the spaghetti bolbgnese, and my lover loved the general gua's chicken
If your looking for loving then dont go into the restrooms they only fit one person at a time
The lighting, the mood and the tables made everything seem to come together
I hear there new years party is not to be missed with legendary DJ coming out of the ranks to put on a show only a drunken sailor on leave would forget
I've only gone to Village Ma in the evenings, when it actually shifts from a restaurant to a bar and lounge
I've had a great time every time
The karaoke is great, the crowd is encouraging, they have a good song selection and a friendly DJ
I've never had a problem with the waitstaff, the drinks are of average dive bar variety, and the space is especially great for a group setting like a birthday party
If you're a bar loner, the front seems to cater to strangers meeting strangers
The crowd is a mix of after-workers and mid-20s locals
If you go late, expect a bouncer at the door so don't leave your ID at home
I also hear there's a comedy show some nights
i've been to this place twice
the first time was okay, i was not impressed with the food
the second time, the food really sucked - tasted like soap
both times, my friends and i have been the only ones in the restaurant besides the waitstaff
the food is cheap and the interior decor is cute
but really its worth spending a few buck extra elsewhere for good thai food
This restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, accented by dim lighting
There's a large area in the back that's great for groups
The food was excellent and the portions were huge
The fried ice cream was a perfect finish to the meal
Staff was very friendly and efficient
I was able to have dinner and dessert for under $20 Overall, this was a great dining experience and i highly recommend it
The Scene When this antique store opened in 1994, its hidden kitchen quickly became an in-the-know favorite
Artisanal Italian ingredients, stellar wines and serious service steadily raised its rank among foodies, while romantics flocked to dine in the 200-year-old candlelit cantina
The livelier rooms upstairs, festooned with funky kitchen bric-a-brac chandeliers and farmhouse furniture, are packed until midnight
The Food Jeremy Griffiths--a Welshman who's cooked in some of Europe's finest kitchens--arrived in summer 2001, and his Mediterranean menu has found its stride
Start with intense slivers of house-cured lonza (pork loin) or wood-grilled sardines, sweet with pickled radishes
Inventive risottos, like summery scallop-fennel-red pepper plumped with carnaroli rice, are among the city's best
Pastas, from rich black truffle-flecked short rib ravioli to tagliatelle in sprightly pea-shell ragu, are pricey but well worth it
Main dishes change nightly: Hope for sage-rubbed porchetta with garlicky black kale
Wow
I am wow-ed
Wonderful, wonderful food - they really take their time with their flavors
You can taste it in every mouthful
Some of the most attentive service I have ever experienced in NYC, or anywhere for that matter
Beautiful location and decor - felt like Tuscany
Felt like home
Please try this gem, you will surely walk away with a new favorite
In 30+ years since I moved to NYC I've never felt more unwelcome or experienced less friendly service than this place
Rude maitre d', inept waiters, rushed service, snooty attitudes - a nightmare experience for my party of 6
The food is pretentious and expensive
However, it is average at best
Frankly there was nothing memorable on the menu which consists of a dozen appetizers and all of 4 main courses
Il Buco is waste of time and money
I will never set foot at this place again
There are plenty of much better Italian restaurants in NYC
I've read the reviews and after my dinner my dinner there two nights ago, I can safely assure any weary diners that Il Buco is tops in Manhattan
I laugh when I read good reviews about typical italian fare and here is this gem a restaurant with amazing olive oils, succulent quail and fish, and perfect desserts taking a beating? Il Buco is classy and perhaps the menu is intimidating for someone who is expecting lasagna at an italian restaurant
Il Buco is not just Italian, it's mediterranean
The chef at the moment leaves a hint of citrous in each dish, uses exotic rices, and doesn't overwhelm any dish
I'll e back to try more as I wasn't able to get past a handful of appetizers and Dessert with wine pairings
The tart was rhubarb
WOW
The Pana Cotta
PERFECT
Don't sleep on this
It doesn't have to try, it's just better than anyone around
Went with friends to celebrate a birthday, such a disappointment
They sat 8 of us at a table that isn't meant for more than 6, we got past that
They kept running out of any bottle of wine we ordered, so constantly had to go back to the wine list and pick something else
The portions are miniscule -- a pasta entree was the size of a small appetizer, we were all hungry at the end of the meal but they certainly supersize the prices
To top it off, I thought the service was not good and rude to boot
Truly, skip it
Brought a client and colleague here for dinner having only read a review of it the night before
The atmosphere is really great if you're looking for a bustling rustic Italian, 'forget you're in a huge city' kind of feel--which I thought was nice for a couple hours
Seated at the end of a communal table turned out to be rather pleasant as we were somewhat separated via a large potted plant on the table
Food was good, not fantastic
Our server started out fine, but seemed to forget about us a few times
Worth checking out with a date or friend
They were out of a lot of their less expensive wines (in the $35-$45 range), so we paid over $100 for 2 bottles of wine
Which were just OK
Even though we sat by the kitchen, it was near IMPOSSIBLE to ever get our waiter
The dishes we got were extremely delicious, but SUPER tiny
Between 5 people we got 2 apps, 5 entrees, and 3 desserts - plus 2 HUGE baskets of their bread
By the end I was so hungry that I wanted to get a slice of pizza or something
And the prices - so outrageous for the portion size
Save your money!!
Although the ambiance is great, the food is not worth the money

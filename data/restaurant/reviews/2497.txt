There was a special pesto linguine that was also very very delicious
The Gnocchi are light and yummy
If a restaurant is not going to take reservations, it is imperative that the person working the door maintains a list and does not whimsically show favoritism
The doorman is rude, condescending, and repeatedly lets anyone he chooses sit down, regardless of arrival time
This is fine at a club; not at an Italian restaurant
Unfortunately, the food is good, though no one should support any establishment that lets this clown run the door
I had read good reviews about the value and food quality at this restaurant, so I was not surprised to see a decently priced menu (pasta under $10 and entrees approx $12 to $15)
When our waiter relayed the specials to us, they were a mile long and sounded better than the regular menu
So we ordered from there
Given the good value of the regular menu, imagine our shock to discover when receiving the bill, how expensive the specials were
The appetizers and entrees we chose were several dollars higher than the most expensive on the regular menu
Overall, the service was decent, though a little rushed when clearing our table
The food was very tasty and it was a pleasant atmosphere
If you eat here, just keep in mind that the specials are much higher than the regular menu when ordering
And ask for the prices
Sure, the price is nice, but the food is just not worth the terrible service and unbelievably long lines
The pasta is mediocre at best; the hosts are always rude
There are far better restaurants on the Upper West Side to get a nice Italian fix; try Pomodoro or Carmine's instead
One of the best hidden Italian restaurants in the City
Hidden away on the upper west side, Gennaro offers an intimate, homestyle atmosphere just like mamma's kitchen
Like any good Italian kitchen, the place is packed and full of action
The menu is full of southern Italian standards like bread salad with tomatoes and mozzarella, penne pomodoro and spaghetti bolognese
In addition, the chef's daily specials would bring olive oil tears to anyone's eyes featuring osso buco and other veal dishes
When receiving the bill, do not be fooled as there wasn't a mathematical error
Dinner for two with a bottle of wine shouldn't cost more than $75
However, there is one caveat, make sure to constantly let the maitre'd know where you are because just like in mama's kitchen, if you don't politely shove your way to the table, you might not get to eat
This place got a great review somewhere and still maintains the buzz
unfortunately, and after a few visits, the verdict is not good
Where the hell did Puccini get off to??? UWSiders are still morning its loss and Gennaro is an ill-suited understudy at best
We had an excellent meal here recently
Unbelievable value ($12 entrees anyone?) and perfectly decent service
Hard to fathom what restaurant the low raters found might have patronized
Smokey grilled calamari infused with garlic had just the right bite
Porcini risotto was as good as it gets this side of Emilia Romagna
Exquisite ravioli in butter and sage sauce - tough dish to pull off given the spareness of the ingredients - was beautifully executed
Eclectic wine list that doesn't scream 300% mark-up
This is Babbo without the expense, month-in-advance reservations and tiresome pretentions of grosso Mario
We could use a few more like Gennaro delivering authentic Italian at prices that don't give you agita
Having heard a lot of people rave about this one, I gave it a try
It isn't bad, but it's certainly not worth all the hype and super-long wait to get in
Standard stuff done in a standard way -- but why wait so long and pay more to get what you can get at a number of other places, even in this neighborhood
Ok
I never go online and review restaurants but I thought I would warn everyone about this one
I just got my wrap delivered - it was the wrap with mashed potatos, chicken and corn
Unfortunatly there was nothing in the menu about a giant cockroach being wrapped up in it! I called and they didn't seem very apologetic but did bring my money back for the wrap
Gross
I about died
Thats all
Thanks
The mushroom and corn quesadilla is excellent--with great condiments to go with it
Generous portions too
Tasty fruit smoothies go nicely with the wraps
The food here is good, but the prices are boosted, i guess to uphold the idea that this place is a 'step up' from the chinese restaurants with the pictures of their entrees lining the walls with no seating area
And don't get me wrong; it is a step up, as far as the atmosphere is concerned, but the food isn't that much better
If you need a place to go to take a date and get some good chinese, go Dynasty, but otherwise, if you're gonna nash on some Chinese and watch a movie tonight, call Wai Lee-a lot cheaper, and just as tasty
Based on the other options in this neighborhood, this is a good take out menu
Texas has a lot of options and decent food
I order from here quite often and have never had a bad experience
I almost avoided on principle due to the $
60 delivery charge(!) but they're nearby and I felt like fried chicken
The result: very fast delivery, mediocre fried chicken, yummy potatoes way too stingy on the gravy, and the capper: a staple in the chili
Yup, a sharp metal staple
Needless to say, I won't be ordering from them again
I have visited this Thai restaurant twice and both times the food was impeccable
Their appetizer was sooo good that i almost wanted to order it twice, Okay I did
Our food arrived a short time later
I had the deep fried salmon with sweet and sour sauce and ohhhhh, the sauce was rich, it was on a nice sized plate, they gave the service w/ a smile at all times and the food did not take forever to come out
I enjoyed my experience here and now my other half and I will be going here more often
Great Food with Great Service
Lemongrass Grill is probably the worst Thai restaurant in the city
Actually, there are really no good Thai restaurants that are good in Manhattan
As a person of Thai descent, I really have to say that the closest Thai food that you can get in New York that comes close to what you can find in other cities like Los Angeles or even Chicago, is Sripraphai in Queens
The menu is extensive and pretty authentic
SEA in both the East Village and Williamsburg have nice decors but the food is only passable
Planet Thailand serves
Japanese food! What an insult
Pongsiri in Chinatown is just ok
Face it, Thai food in New York basically sucks the big one
Go west, my friends!
Best takeout place around the columbia campus
Food is consistently good and greasy
Awesome meal before some late night drinking
I get delivery from this place and let me tell ya it's fast and pretty darn good
I have had it all there from noodles, rices, meats, and veggies
It's a great fix for Upper West Korean Food
Mill is a great little place
You just have to know what to order
Their silk tofu casserole with seafood is usually good
Their noodle soup called kalgooksoo is usually good although sometimes the noodles can be overdone
Their hot stone pot rice cakes in red pepper sauce for two (also known as modeum ddukboki) is usually excellent but only fit for the experienced and adventurous or native palate
The same goes for their squid sauteed in red pepper sauce is also good (this dish is known as nakji-bokum)
The service is usually quick and easy, plus its always interesting to look at the clippings and tchotchkes
i ate here for the first time the other night
the food was all right, but i probably won't go back
we had the mackeral (lots of bones) and the hot seafood pot
the seafood was chewy and the dish was flavorless, though the condiments are always good
the service was horrible: impatient, unhelpful and inattentive
i don't mind attitude from a server but only if i get the basic service, which i did not
the bathroom was very well decorated, though
Unlike the former reviewer, Jacob, I have spent quite a bit of time in Korea

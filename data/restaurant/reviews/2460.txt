For every restaurant that lives up to its hype, there are many more which are disappointing
Unfortunately Ollie falls into the latter category
The food is average at best and not at all close to authentic
However, I believe cuisine doesn't have to be authentic to be tasty and enjoyable, this is the case in fusion and pan-asian cooking
Even in this regard, Ollie falls short
If you are looking for some quick Chinese food uptown, there aren't too many choices
But for real tasty food or an enjoyable dining, take the time to travel midtown or downtown for better options
I had the Little Bit of Everything Soup which lived up to its name and was pretty good
The portion was very fair for its price as well
But the location near Columbia seemed to have a considerably more difficult time running itself than the location in the 70s (I think that's where it is)
Generally, I always look down on a waitress who puts a lemon in my Corona instead of a lime
Who doesn't have limes???
This is authentic chinese food at is best! The food is superb (and cheap!)
I especially love their noodles and roast meats
The service was friendly and the food arrived quickly
This place is especially great for before or after a movie since their locations are so great with lots of entertainment nearby
I would highly recommend this place!
This particular Ollie's is the biggest of the bunch
A more limited menu than the other locations, though still quite large
The steamed vegetable dumplings are divine
The soups are quite good too
The enclosed patio in front is good for a casual quick takeout bite
Try to sit downstairs within the restaurant, upstairs is quite crowded
For how quickly they produce the food, it's all remarkably good
This large franchise is better than it has any right to be
The soups and noodles are definitely the way to go--I really like the duck ones
The entrees aren't too memorable, but not bad either
What's really amazing is how fast they turn this stuff out
It's large enough that you never have to wait long for a table, either
I've been to 3 other Jackson Hole locations (2 in Queens on 3rd Ave) the food is the same ! Huge Burgers Excellent French Fries ! But unless I go there starving - there is no way I can finish my whole meal
There are many different burger choices with all kinds of toppings
They have a bunch of other sandwiches, a large breakfast menu even a south of the border section which was great since the Mexican place next door looked awesome we couldn't decide which to go to
We were able to get Nachos burgers all at one place ! ! This Jackson hole has an outdoor area with tables on Columbus Ave
It looks like a diner but has mostly hamburgers on the menu ! Definitely a great place if you're looking for alot of food for not alot of money
The turkey burgers are to die for!! The best I have ever had
I hear the beef burgers are good too
If you go here, definitely get the HUGE burgers! If you're a fan of burgers, this is the place to go
When I first moved to NYC I asked a few people where I should go to get a really good burger
Sadly people directed me to this loaction
Each time I have been to this location the bun fell apart
The lettuce was warm and limp instead of crisp and cool
The patty was dry and not cooked to the tempature I requested which is medium rare
And to top that all off I have to basically beg to get a soda refill
The only good thing about this location is Jennifer Aniston once worked there
Unless you are hoping for a Jennifer and Brad sighting stay away
If you have ever wanted to eat a burger the size of your head, Jackson Hole is the place to go
Great variety of toppings too
I recommend the burger with cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms
Jackson Hole has the best burgers in town that one could ever have
If you haven't tried one please do so
Espesially the cheddar burger with bacon and mushrooms
Heaven On Earth!!
The burgers served here are in a word huge! Huge in size, taste, bang for your buck! A NYC burger institution that's definitely worth experiencing if you're into eating things that go mooo!
The burgers are big enough to split among 3 people and still be satisfied
The onion rings are amazing
And the waitresses, especially in the outdoor seating, are terrific!
The best and biggest hamburger you will ever eat
They cook it just the way you like it, it simply melts in your mouth! Everyone there is awesome
Nick is really great!
This place has the best burgers I have ever had anywhere else in the city
They are huge in size and absolutely delicious
The service is prompt and the price is reasonable
Be prepared to take some food home
I stumbled into this place by accident
It is very romantic and savy
The type of place you would take someone you love
The staff was especially friendly
All the items I ordered was great but what I was most taken by was the bread basket
It was the best bread I have ever had in my life
This place is a hit with me
I will be going back often
Discovered Isola by accident
The menu was inviting so we walked in
The wine list, thou short, was eclectic, informative and well priced
The service was great, but the food was magnificent! All of our dishes were simple preperations with flavorful ingredients
Everything was fresh
Go there for the food, the straight forward decor and the friendly unpretentious service
For the last ten years, Isola has been my favorite neighborhood restaurant
With reliable, delicious, authentic Italian food, friendly and fun wait staff, and a lovely atmosphere, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for West Side eats
Delizioso!
isola is an excellent trattoria reminscent of Positano and the south of italy
I have travelled extensively in Italy and i find it difficult to find simple unpretenscious food using the freshest ingredients
Bravi!Isola is my favourite italian on the upper west side
Everytime I go to Isola, the friendly staff and comfortable surroundings make me feel at home
The food is consistent, the manager is attentive and the owner (who's often there) is clever and funny
It's sort of a low profile place, I live nearby and frequent Isola often
Shhh
don't spoil my secret
BTW, best pizza around!
Good food, always friendly fast service
Great for when Manhattan gets a bit too much - it's like a peaceful respite from the din
Great bar too
Fresca salad is excellent
Simple, clean flavors, very reasonably priced
Atmosphere feels European
This place must be some sort of front
nobody is ever there and its outlived 3/4 of the resturants in the neighborhood
The pizza isn't too bad, but overall its just a place to go when you can't get a table at Avenue, Prohibition OR Jackson Hole
Skip it if you can
Very average place

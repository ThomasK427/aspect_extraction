When it arrived again, the goat cheese was cold
They didn't bring bread and I had to ask three times to get it
(No refills on soda, but you'd expect that from a French place)
The expresso was small - much smaller than ones I usually received when living in france
The waiters were getting a wine class from a very loud manager and ignoring all the patrons - someone should have been giving them a class on serving instead
In a neighborhood with so many other wonderful options, its obvious that 24 hour service is the only reason this place stays open
Ive had many great meals at LExpress but today was a disaster
Empty on what should have been a busy Sunday: Are other also sensing a problem here? Waited forever for the waitress, forever again for the food
No bread ever came
Cold fries
Croque monsieur awful: One TINY SLIVER of ham in an enormously greasy and tastelessly large sandwich
Yech! Bread quality still high
pommes frites would have been good hot
Waitress NEVER came back
When I finally chased her down and complained about the sandwich she SMILED and asked our dessert plans
Not a language issue: Shes a native English-speaking American
No apology, no offer of a different main course
The horror was billed in full
Dessert was fine, but also billed in full
Thats wrong
Id hate to lose LExpress but Im waiting for other recent reviews here at City Search before going back
Went with the girls for dinner last night, and experienced only a minor wait (10 min) on a busy Thursday night
Service was very friendly and relatively prompt for a place as jammed as it was
My girlfriends and I were extremely impressed with the quality of food: I had the escargots and steak au poivre, and both just about melted in my mouth! To top it all off, we shared the molten chocolate cake dessert which was sinfully rich and delish
My only (small) gripe was I wish someone had made an effort to replace the full glass of red wine that I spilled down my shirt
Oh well
can't have it all can we?
You can't beat L'Express after a strong night of partying
My girlfriends and I always make a point of making L'Express a part of the night - it's almost like a ritual now
Egg white omelettes, goat cheese salad, and great burgers
Not only is this one of the few awesome 24 hour restaurants in the area, but the staff is great
I accidentally left a cashmere scarf that had a great deal of sentimental value and the waiter placed it in the lost+found for me!
I love this quaint bistro! Crowd is busy for lunch, dinner is romantic, open late
I just adore it
Highly rec!
Good ambience
Good inexpensive food
I was impressed with the salomon tartar and Foie Gras
I went to L'Express a few weeks ago and definitely enjoyed the experience! The wine list is much longer than the menu itself, but none of us were complaining
The service is slow and it is very crowded, but its definitely worth the trip!
I've been here a few times before
The food is pretty good, although I liked the fries a lot more than my sandwich
The waiters were courteous and prompt
I hosted a brithday party this fall at L'Express with 20 guests
I cannot begin to tell you how great the staff was
They accomodated my every request, corked and served the champagne that I brought in, delivered the birthday cake with candles to the table
The food was delicious and the service impeccable
I've been there several times since and cannot stop singing the praises of this restaurant
And it's open 24 hours!!
This is a nice place for lunch
Service was quick and beat expectations
You should probably try the Lyonnaise specialties, but the sandwich menu has decent standard fare, and they come with a plate of delicious thin fries
My croque monsieur delivered
Also has an excellent lunch wine list and a solid beer list
Prices are decent, you can have a meal for under 20 bucks
ONLY USE THIS PLACE AS A BACK UP
THE SERVICE IS NOTORIOUSLY BAD
I KNOW CUZ I USED TO WAITRESS AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT KIND OF SERVICE! THE TABLES ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THE FOOD IS ADEQUATE ALTHOUGH NOTHING SPECIAL
FOR A 24 HOUR PLACE GO TO FLORENT (BETTER FOOD
MORE MONEY BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING FOR IT) OR TO SIDEWALK CAFE FOR CHEAPER FARE
When we can't figure out where to eat, L'Express is a good backup
I do think the dinner menu is better than the lunch menu, but most of the food is quite good
I am especially fond of the sausage of the day
I'm not a drinker, and I find that the waiters usually blow us off and ignore us once we don't spend a lot of money ordering wine, and the water takes a while to get re-filled, but the food is good enough that we return
It is quite crowded, but we never have to wait more than 15-20 minutes for a table
This place has great food--I highly recommend the escargo smothered in garlic and bread crumbs and the dialy special fish which is almost always served with the best risotto I've ever had in a terrific sauce
My friends and I always come here when we have been out drinking all night and we need to chow down
The service is fast, it's always crowded, and the food is always good
The strongest thing this place has going is that it is open all the time and attracts a pretty eclectic late night crowd
I wouldnt say anything is extravagantly good, but the burgers are always a good bet
The staff can be a bit slow and sometimes pretentious
Although, theres nothing to stop me from dining here at 3AM when Im in the neighborhood
Although the food was decent, it's a major exageration to call this place insanely good
The 3 dishes were all pretty bland and not very spicy at all
The entrees are reasonably priced, but considering the tiny portions and the mediocre taste, it's not a very good value
Some of the places in midtown are definitely better
The best indian food for the money
Try the saag panir and homemade cheese or one of the sampler platter
Everything is great, even if you are not vegetarian, you will love it
I MUST STEAL THE WORDS FROM AN EARLIER REVIEW WHERE THEY DESCRIBED THIS RESTAURANT AS INSANE IT IS HARD TO COMPLAIN IN THIS RESTAURANT WHERE THE VALUE IS CLEARLY SURPASSED BY THE QUALITY OF FOOD AND SERVICE
THE WAITER WAS THE NICEST GUY HE EVEN WARNS US THAT WE WERE ORDERING TO MUCH FOOD OR JUST SAYS THAT THIS IS HORRIBLE FOR SOME THING HE WAS NOT CRAZY ABOUT
THE FOOD FAR EXEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS I THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE SO I VISITED TWICE SINCE THE FIRST TIME AND EACH TIME I WAS MORE IMPRESED
A PLACE LIKE THIS IS HARD TO STOP TALKING ABOUT
While the decor here is average, the food is INSANE
I literally eat at this restaurant about 4-5 times a week minimum and I am not a vegetarian
Also, a lovely bonus is that since I became a regular I have lost weight as a direct result of eating their low fat/cal menu items
The owner and his top guy will mold any offering to your taste and will suggest things you may have never even considered based on your tastes
I always leave feeling like I had the best meal in town
There is a reason this place has become more and more popular over the last few years
Oh yeah, it's also insanely cheap for the food and quality
Lovely!
You will never miss the meat at this wonderful vegetarian South Indian restaurant
The owner also works in the kitchen and gives special attention to everything prepared right down to each sauce/chutney
It's located near 6th Street but in terms of food quality, it's a million miles away
I've tried nearly everything on the menu and it's all great! Try the duhi vada, vegetable uthappam, masala dosa, chili pakora, poriyal, korma, plain paratha, etc
Portions are generous - order several things to share with your companions
Words cannot describe how bad the chicken dishes are
What-did-I-do-to-deserve-this bad
My girlfriend and I were both nauseas from the taste
Maybe just a bad batch (does chicken come in batches?), but we received no explanation

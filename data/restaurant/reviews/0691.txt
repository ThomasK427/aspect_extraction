Don't get the Tarafin D'orcite
I was excited to try out supper but i've never had worse food at any restaurant than this
My entree was just some noodles in a butter sauce with no texture or color, except for a little bit of spinach which was more like a garnish
No chunks, no color, no taste
It was a bowl of pastaroni
Don't want to lambast the whole restaurant, my friend liked his entree, but if a restaurant would consider having a tasteless entree on its menu as what i got, then i wouldn't be too keen on the other entrees
yuck yuck yuck
We went in preparing for the worst due to Citysearch reviews
I guess we got lucky because we were seated promptly
the service was reasonably good, and the food was yummy (apps, entrees AND dessert)
Good house prosecco
The barbera we ordered needed more time to air (3+ hours, to tell you the truth)
We all felt it was a good value for the money, so much so that we went next door to the wine bar area to have another bottle or two of bubbly before heading out
I hope they continue to improve because the space was cozy, the food good and the experience wholyl enjoyable!
So i heard the rumor that the 15 specials they name off before you order are the same every night
then why are they SPECIALS? I was really exicted to try this place out after reading good reviews all over the place but thought it could not hold water to Il Bagato down the street but don't get me wrong it was still decent
Also I don't like Artichokes and boy do they serve them, they must have an Aritchoke garden in the back or something
I was absolutely disgusted with the service at this place
If you want to be degraded, then this is the restaurant for you
It seems that the hostess feels it's necessary to keep track of the customers on the wait list by writing insulting descriptions
short chubby guy with 3 girls was the exact writing on her board about my friend
When the hostess and supposed manager were questioned about it, they proudly responded that my friend should not have been reading the board and, the best one, that there could have been worse things they could have written!!!! The hostess explained that she had to describe people somehow to find them in the crowd
No apology, no nothing!!!!
I love this restaurant, everytime I go I am never disappointed
The food is great very affordable the staff is so accomodating the wine selection is huge
Supper is a great place
The food is very good (especially the Veal Milanese which is one of the best in town)
The wines are very good too and not too expensive
The only problem is the extremly long lines
However, you can spend time in the nice wine bar next door
We even got a whole bottle of wine for free as compensation for our patience
I would like to know where the reviewers who complain about the prices usually eat
I find the prices very affordable
I shouldn't be telling you, but I loved this place
(no, I'm not the owner, employee or in any other way affiliated with this restaurant
) My date and I were greeted by the host and informed there would be a slight wait
She suggested we head to their bar next door
While seated at the bar, the tender asked what we were having
Being interested in a glass of wine we asked for a Pinot Noir
The bartender took the time to share with us a number of Italian varieties that may better appeal to our interests in wine
She proceeded to pour four sample glasses and described the region, history, and differences in each wine we were tasting
Did I mention this was while we were waiting for a table? The food was great, the ambience was simple but romantic and I will be back for more very soon
I love the food at Supper, but the service sucks
They are nice, but they never offer more wine, bring out entrees when you haven't finished your apps
They don't even try to take care of you
If you have a nice bottle of wine, dinner for 2 is easily $100
THEY SHOULD TRY TO GIVE GOOD SERVICE
We won't go back anymore
Having lived in Italy, I was astounded by how bad this restaurant was
Lively, vibrant tasting food somehow did not exist in any of the dishes we tried and although the dishes were inexpensive, you would be better off going to Supper's sister Frank for a meal
At least the food there tastes like something rather than an excuse for additional salt
That said though, the service was good and the atmosphere as well
until the guy dressed up in a pink bear costume came in for a birthday party and insisted on yelling for what seemed like at least 20 minutes
Thank god we were on our way out
The overall experience is incredible--I've been here a bunch of times
The wine list is incredible, the food is incredible
They take no reservations, no credit cards, but do they have a wine bar one door down where you can sample some of their selections before dinner if you have to wait (they'll come looking for you when your table is ready)
Be prepared to dine with strangers at the same table, and you must place your order all at once
The food and decor are excellent, though service was somewhat poor
The waitress was on her own terms, though the other staff were polite
Would try again - hoping the poor service was specific to the waitress and not the establishment
The bus boy dropped the bread
At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we wanted another drink, the after agreeing to have one she stated, actually there's a list of people waiting, can you go next door to the bar
After waiting ourselves, sitting at the counter and being there for exactly 33 minutes, she was asking us to not sit for another 10 for a drink
The rudest restaurant experience I have ever had
I will NEVER GO BACK!
Went to eat here tonight and felt so unhappy that I had to sit and write this immediately
For two pasta entrees and one meat, plus one of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu ($37) and one dessert we were charged $115
$45 a head with tip for bad gnocchi, mediocre wine (as recommended by a condescending waiter, who thought himself oh-so-nice) and the feeling that our companions (at our shared table) were listening in on all our chatter
Wouldn't recommend this place at all
Save your money and cook at home
WOW
Great place
Sat at bar and watch the cooks
Pasta - spaghetti with lemon and parmesan was delicious
My friend got the pasta with dad's marinara sauce with ricotta which was awesome
Waitress was nice but had a little attitude
The food is very good, and I love the extensive wine list, especially the half-bottles
Beware: the hostess seems to think the patrons work for her
Our dinner on a January Monday was enjoyable, but would have been better if she had offered a warmer greeting than a snarl, and had allowed us to sit in one of the booths rather than at a tiny table for 1
5 people
(The booths remained unoccupied throughout our meal, unless you count the not-very-busy waitstaff
) Later when I was walking to the bathroom she cut me off on her way to get her menus
Our waiter water guy were the saving grace of Supper: they went the extra mile to make sure we left satisfied
Good thing since our supposedly cheap meal (1 appetizer, 1 half bottle of wine, 2 entrees) came to $90 w/ tax tip
I ordered the Amarone wine risotto off the blackboard above the bar, which listed a different risotto for each day of the week
It was the BEST RISOTTO my fiance or I had ever tasted!! We could not help but finish the large portion
My fiance ordered the half-chicken she ate half of that along with half my risotto
We sat at one of the 2 large tables with benches inside the door instead of at the bar - the only options available at 7:15 when we arrived
It was a bit chilly due to cold breeze from outside whenever anyone came inside but it warmed up as the table filled up (with 6 people)
The check (cash only) for 2 people, including 1 homemade lemonade, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, came to $60 bucks
We didn't have wine but there was a long list available
Supper is great! The food is fantastic -- from appetizers (try the grilled asparaus grilled polenta w/ parmesan) to entree to dessert (awesome tirimisu)
The service was good and the overall ambience was very cozy (candle lit, brick walls, etc
)
In the beginning everything about this place was awesome
Yet, it is obvious that service has taken a backseat to buzz
The charm has worn off and inexperienced and tired students have replaced a once enthusiastic staff
The food is great
Although the menu is due for any slight upgrade

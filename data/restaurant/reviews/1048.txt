The Food The menu plays with cultural pairings, the most flavorful being the mezes
Butterflied sardine, seasoned with cilantro, garlic and parsley melts in the mouth, while the calamari seviche features bok choy for a nicely textured dish
Lamb figures heavily in entrees: Chops arrive tender and juicy, and kabobs are large, heavily spiced patties
Jerusalem artichokes accompany the tender five-spiced duck confit for yet another twist
Save room for dessert: The first taste of the malibi with its rose-infused cream will instantly refresh, as will vanilla ice cream with date honey and tahini
I live in the area and have been to Taboon a few times with friends
The food was tasty but nothing so special
Then I learned that all the meat prepared in a pork glaze
including the chicken! I find it unethical for a restaurant not to list this on the menu
Intresting enough every other ingrediant down to the parsley was listed on the menu
but another meat wasn't? So wrong! Also the service was quite off putting
I noticed that a lot of waiters were approaching my table but the service was not any better
Messages were lost between the waitstaff or something
I waited a long time for my drink
(So long that it prevented me from increasing their sales by getting more possible drinks) If i just saw my one waiter the whole night I would have known who to talk too
The restaurant has a great ambience and the food is great
If you are not so hungry then share a few of the appetizers with your frien kadayif and the sea scallops
If you are in the mood for a whole fish, I highly recommend the branzino
It is delicately flavored with rosemary and baked to perfection
Tender and juicy
Superb
I've always had a great experience at Taboon
Good menu (lamb shank to die for), wine list and service
Recently, I hosted a party of 20 and the restaurant host could not have been more accomodating
Everyone had a great time and the food was very good
It is off the beaten path, but worth the trip!
We visited this restaurant over the New Years Weekend and were amazed by the entire experience
We dine in the city often and this was a great find
The waitress was exceptional, the food was incredible not to mention the great atmosphere
The waitress recommended a greek wine they had just started serving and it was out of this world
We had 2 children with us and they enjoyed the place and the food as well although it would really work for a romantic dinner for 2 perfectly
Going back this weekend for my birthday
I went there last night for my anniversary, and the place was unbelievable
We got there before our reservation and the seated us quickly
The atmosphere was really relaxing, the lights are dim and there are candles at every table, even the noise was quiet (there were about 25 tables in the whole place
great place for a date)
The staff there is SO nice and the service is GREAT! The food was even better and the prices very reasonable
Will absolutely go back!!!
This unpretentious restaurant with quality food to rival the best in the City gave us a wonderful evening
Service was outstanding
Our waitress was most helpful with suggestions from the unique menu
The flatbread was warm, flavorful and a specialty of this restaurant
The tables were set so that you were not squeezed next to your neighbor
From appetizers through dessert--everything was more than expected--a meal we are still talking about
Been there for Brunch - food was great - atmosphere was warm and inviting
Went for dinner on a Monday - did not need a reservation - though it was quite full
Staff was very nice
The place looks upscale from outside but has a very relxing atmosphere
There was a band on Monday night
fabulous! Spanish music
the ambiance - the music - the food made you feel like you were on vacation in Greece or Spain and made you wish you were going to the medditerranean soon
Few people got up and danced - flamenco-ish - belly-dancing - very fun atmosphere without being loud and overbearing
Food was definitely good! Romantic yet group place
Kids at brunch would work well
I had a client requesting 'Anything but STEAK' for dinner
Being a frequent business diner I was ready for something different
I had heard of Taboon and gave it a try
What a wonderful dining experience
Service was very, very good
The waitresses detailed explanation help both of us choose from the wonderful range of choices
We decided on several appetizers, the clear winner was the sardines, something I normally wouldnt have tried
The osso bucco was excellent but the chicken was outstanding
The desserts were unbelievable, each very unique
Chocolate cake was rich but worth every calorie
My companion had the Silan which was just the way to finish an excellent meal
The evening was first-rate
Service, food and ambience all were of the highest quality
I will certainly be back to try some of the things I missed this time
Great food (from mezes to desserts), quiet mellow atmosphere with great service
I am so happy I found this little gem right in Clinton(Hell's Kitchen)
This block was so in need of an amazing restaurant and it has found it in Taboon
The white tables and walls give it a cool,relaxed,Mediterranean feel to it
The servers are very friendly, helpful and relaxed(but just the right amount, they are still attentive), you could linger at your table for hours after dinner
I went for brunch and the food was excellent
Try the Eggs benedict (not like any you have had before with a skirt steak and their amazing bread)
The bread they bring to the table is sooo yummy
Fresh baked and warm, with rosemary spices
This place gets an A+
I will definitely be back !
THE BEST BRUNCH IN NYC! LOVELY BREADS BUT DON'T FILL UP
TRY THE SHAKSHUKA (SPELLING?) -- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS
WE HAD IT WITH A SPICY LAMB SAUSAGE THAT WAS SPECTACULAR! WE ALSO HAD THE EGGS BENEDICT
UNLIKE ANY EB YOU EVER HAD
SERVED ON AMAZING BREAD WITH SKIRT STEAK AND EGGS
I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW TASTY IT WAS
THIS BRUNCH IS DIFFERENT FROMM THE STANDARD FARE AND TRULY DELICIOUS
Had dinner with 2 friends last week and everything we had was delicious
The mezes and bread were amazing
My friends enjoyed fish and I had the best osso bucco
everything was cooked perfectly
I have been to Taboon before and the service has improved greatly
The atmosphere is hard to explain
it is somewhat noisy -- yet electric
Everybody seems to be having a really good time
Great Bread! Unique flavors
A real dining treat
Interesting, tasty Middle Eastern food
I would highly recommend this restaurant to a friend
Taboon has rapidly become one of my favorite restaurants in Hell's Kitchen
The bread is to die for, as are the wide array of meze (tapas-like appetizers)

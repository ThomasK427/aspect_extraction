I thought the smoothie was excellent because it was not too sweet
I have been back several times and tried 2 other smoothies and a wonderful fresh juice called Mr
Greengenes
Overall I had a good experience here and I will continue to go back and try other drinks that they offer
A great, healthy addition to our neighborhood!
I been going to Juice Generation on 72nd Street for about 2 years
The people who work at the store are extremely nice and always remember me - but the reason I go is for the Mr
Greenjeans and my mixed berry soy muffin
This is healthy stuff and it tastes so good
I have also bought the cranny smith tuna (sp?) sandwich and it was also very good for about $5
00
I highly recommend this place for a healthy lunch or fresh juice
I also appreciate that they keep things really clean and all the vegetables look very fresh
A good experience is a great juice bar!
I admit it, I am a Juice Junkie! This is my FAVORITE store in the city as they have the best smoothies and juices I have ever tasted
Some of the drinks do have nonfat yogurt, but I always ask for organic agave nectar instead (no extra charge!)  The smoothies are all good and juices are fresh and delicious
The vegetables they use are always very clean and so is the store - they have great music!  I also love the hot drinks like Cold Warrior and Ginger Guru when it's cold outside
They offer fresh bakery called Soy Bundts that are filled with soy protein and low in fat - delicious!  This is the BEST place for fresh juices in the city that I have visited
My daily addiction!
If its late, and you want a burger, but your friend wants a pizza, and your other friend wants a gyro, and your other other friend wants a sandwitch, come to Big Nicks
They can make you more or less anything with their huge menu and their small kitchen
I've been comming to Big Nicks for a while, often taking the walk over when I'm hungry but don't have a clue what I want
I always seem to find what I'm looking for on their menu
With reasonable prices, Big Nicks goes over well with anyone
My suggestion for a first timer is the Garlic Sumo Burger w/Mozzeralla Cheese
Its HUGE and its always cooked right
The Sumo burger is heavenly it is a Meat lovers dream
1 pound of hamburger on a bun with any and I mean any topping you want
I believe this comes with an order of fries and a 20 oz drink for less than 10 dollars!!!!!!!!!!!  WHOA!!  I Highly recommond this meat lovers haven
This is a great place to take someone who you've already passed the first date with and now want to impress on a second date, without spending too much money or going somewhere that you have to wait in line to get seated
It's dimly lit with a great moroccan-lounge feel to it, not too crowded, and has excellent come closer seating options (big cushy round booths)
It's also a place that isn't very well known because it's somewhat hidden by being located on the second level
I love Fez and always try to go back whenever I can
They have a quite diverse yet basic menu, so there's bound to be something you'll like
Pizza, burgers, pasta, and I think I even remember seeing a Mexican dish
So far I haven't been disappointed and the prices are very reasonable
They also carry my favorite wine, Casa Julia, Sauvignon Blanc, which I highly recommend
My boyfriend and I were supposed to attend a friend's birthday party at the uptown location of Fez but he was stopped at the door by the manager and told that he was not dressed appropriately
(He was wearing a black T-shirt and black pants
) I asked to speak with the manager myself, but he refused to talk to me
Meanwhile, we watched scores of men clad in T-shirts and baggy jeans walk right in without any problem
At this point, we called our friend on his cell phone to explain the situation, and he opted to move his party elsewhere
Apparently the uptown Fez doesn't need certain people's business
Stick to the downtown location, where you can enjoy yourself without the nasty attitude
Went out looking for some quick Italian and came across this by chance, gave it a shot and was very impressed and pleased with our meal
The setting very sublte very nice with exposed brick, a great wine cellar in the back, nice lighting, and the whole front opens wide out to the street it had great outdoor spots
We both ordered old school, traditional spaghetti, which was very nice with an incredible sauce with all sorts of great ingredients
My wife had meatballs which could have been better, almost appeared store bought
But overall loved the place, outside of our waiter who literally tried to force us into ordering drinks
he literally asked us 4 times, it was very uncomfortable
Nonetheless, I recommend especially in the summertime
Also the portion size was very nice, in that they didn't give me 8lbs of spaghetti
it was just the perfect amount
Kind of a small place but the food and service are both really good
Whenever we were out of the bread, they replensihed it quickly
Prices are affordable too
had 5 or 6 porcini ravioli in the lunch entree
hardly filling
also had squid salad over mesclun
the squid was good but the mesclun was just a few pieces of lettuce
It falls a little short of authentic because the spice level is dumbed down a great deal for gringo palates that can't handle the heat (like mine!), and there's less use of fish sauce than the real McCoy -- but for what it is, it's not bad at all
We ordered the curry puffs, spicy noodles and pad see ew for delivery
It took 1/2 an hour for the food to arrive in the pouring rain and the delivery person was cheerful, friendly, and nice despite being soaking wet
I consider this pretty good!   It's not the best you'll find in NYC, but for the place and price, it's hard to beat
Next time, we're going to be a little more adventurous in our ordering
There's some fusiony stuff on the menu that look pretty tasty (fried ginger cornmeal-breaded catfish)
Now if only they'd offer pho, too
The thai food is delicious, and it's the best Tom Yum shrimp soup I've ever had, but out of the 6 times I've ordered through them, they've messed up my order in some way shape or form 4 times
It also is rather pricey for Thai food and the portions are small
That being said, they make great ice tea and the food is undeniably good
Still, I hesitate to go there because who knows if I'll get the right order
I have been coming to this place since it opened a few years ago
The food is very good and I think the portions are fine
I read the above reviews and was a little shocked
It's a Thai restaurant, not an all you can eat buffet
I have been to many Thai restaraunts in the city both exensive and inexpensive and this is by far my favorite
Noteable dishes are the Pad King with chicken, the spicey noodles, fried rice, spring rolls, The spicey bbq chicken and sticky rice, and the Yam Neur (beef salad)
The beef salad is great, but very spicey
The Thai iced tea is also great and they make a very good lychee martini
Servers are always helpful
It is by far one of the best options in the columbia area
Looking to find good food in a neighborhood with few options; this was, by far, the worst
While the place was cute and enticing, and the staff helpful, there is no redeeming the food
Portions were adequate (c
f
reviewer 1), but inedible
The microwaved rice had more in common with a hockey puck than anything I'd eaten before
The chicken had to have been soaked in soy sauce and then frozen
As cute as you try to make the place, you disguise bad food
This is a pretty good place
Strong points were the service (my waitress was excellent) and the food was prepared well
I think that there could have been more food served, though - with the small quantities you would have thought we were at a much fancier place, and I think this is the impression they were (unsuccessfully) going for
While the food was very good (my duck with pineapple was moist and yummy), it was appropriate for its price and not incredible
The quantity issue is the only thing keeping this place from being a great value
But don't expect to be wowed
Be sure to try the Thai iced tea
Charging $10 prix-fixe for a three-course dinner, this place is simply the best value in Manhattan; and Eve, the proprietress, treats you like family
I don't know why it isn't mobbed by Columbia students, or why Eve hasn't moved out of her closet-sized enclave, but for the moment at least, it remains an amazingly well-kept secret
this is some of the best fish on the east coast
the preparation is mediocre, the digs aren't great and the service is cordial

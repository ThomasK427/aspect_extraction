If you are lucky to make it there on a Tuesday evening, you'll find delicious cheese and chocolate fondue in the relaxed, welcoming atmosphere
The ambience, wine, and food combine to form a greater whole making the brasserie experience that which it was intended to be
Visit Brasserie Julien
My husband and I dined tonight at this charming little brasserie
The atmosphere is like a slice of 1920s Paris--art deco lighting with bugundy velvet seating, irridescent silk sheers and a live jazz sax/guitar duo playing
It's rare my 6'5 husband leaves a French restaurant filled up, but the bison steak he ordered was enormous
The beaujolais was superb
But the biggest plus to this place was the service--EVERYONE was attentive kind, from the hostess who gave us a romantic corner table, to the waitress who came by many times, all the way to the OWNER who was walking by the tables monitoring everything all night
He went out of his way to make sure we were happy
All in all it was a romantic and special dining experience
Highly recommended, especially for intimate dates or a double date with some old friends
French with Eastern-inspired accents, the best mussels, wonderful fries
Huge portions, delicate flavors, reasonable prices
Beautiful art deco location, warm, romantic, and relaxing
Classsic brasserie food prepared my a master-with a bit of a twist at times
Everything on the menu is excellent
Enjoyable enough to go once a week and never get bored
Be transported to Paris at this neighborhood French bistro on the Upper East Side
Vive la difference
Last year's addition of a new chef and renovated decor combine to provide a wonderful, warm ambiance and delicious menu selections
This is one of thsoe places you kind of just walk by on the Upper East and don't think about it
It was a great place
Service was great and friendly, menu was creative and had a wide variety, and great beer
A definite recommend foir a date or even just drinks up front in the comfy chairs
This little-known italian place is definitely worth trying-out
The small cozy dining area is adorable, the service is impecable and friendly (so much so that you'll think you're not actually in NYC), and the food is fantastic
I have been here a few times and keep bringing people back over and over, with only rave reviews! Among the slew of so-so Italian places sprinkling the Upper East Side, what a surprisingly fantastic neighborhood find!
I stopped in here for a few slices yesterday and found the pizza to be as good as I've ever had
The cheese and sauce compliment each other to perfection
The crust is thin and chewy
It was so good, I had to control myself not to wolf down a few more slices
I'm not from New York City so I am not used to pizza this good
My son lives on the same block as the restaurant so I'll be back often
I've been here with my husband alone or with the kids
The pizzas are great for the kids, and the salads and pastas are excellent
The service is very friendly, even if you aren't ordering big, and the owners have even donated food for some of our school's events (our public school is around the corner)
I just had dinner here a couple of days ago for the first time
I wish I had known about this place before
The food is excellent
It is a small place, but the service and food make up for it
I am planning to go back in a couple of weeks
This restaurant is small and very good! The service was exceptional and the food was to die for
To top it all off it was very inexpensive
I would recommend this to everyone!!!
The food was not good, and pricey for what it is! Also, the service was awful
I will never eat at this restaurant again
Juicy burgers, fresh salads, coffee that tastes like coffee! Their kitchen serves a lot of great dishes
I eat lunch, and even dinner, here often, and have never been disappointed
The staff is also very friendly and accommodating
Try the moosaka (?), it's deeeelish!
great place to grab some good food after a wonderful trip to the met
especially for those college kids out there who just paid their 25 cents and want a cheap eat
try the onion soup! it's wonderful!!!
They convinced me to buy their expensive House Special
I liked it all (comes with few dishes including 2 lamb kabobs)
They said i could switch the tandoori chicken for tikka masala
instead, they brought me no tikka masala and 2 pieces of tandoori chicken to replace my kabob which i had not changed in any way
PLUS, he made NO OFFER to bring me my meal
instead i paid a lot for HALF what i ordered, and a dish i did not order
also, their fountain and bird noises (fake) were very annoying, it sounded like my cat's toys
AM NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN
HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO SCREWED ME OUT OF WHAT I PAID FOR
No need to travel to Jackson Heights
This is the best Indian food in the city
And the weekend buffet is hugely varied and absolutely fabulous!
The Scene Dark wood, landscape paintings and Old-World sconces hint at the classic attitude of this Italian favorite, which attracts its share of families, middle-aged friends and the occasional celebrity
Warm, golden light flatters everyone, though the high noise level can distract from conversation
Service is professional and well-timed, performed by cordial, professional waiters
The Food The cooking offers more satisfaction than surprise
Bresaola valtellina, a thin layer of dried beef over arugula, has a delicate texture and zesty flavor, and the shrimp and white-bean salad is refreshingly seasoned and balanced
Earthy aromatics saturate the delicious porcini risotto, and the nodino alla salvia--a butterfly-cut veal roasted with rosemary and sage--packs a pleasing juiciness
Less successful are the zuppa de pesce, which contains tough selections of lobster meat, and the spicy, but undercooked, penne lucifero
For dessert, the tart, creamy Key lime pie is a delight
If you want great food but are willing to sacrifice any sort of self respect or service then Elio's is the place to go
The food we had was excellent but the host was extremely unpleasant (sat us late for a reservation), the waiter didn't appear for 20 minutes
When he did manage to grace us with his presence he took the orders and then left for another 30 minutes
They never brought the bread to the table, the second glass of wine we ordered never showed up, no one ever checked in on us, and lastly they give everyone a couple of peice of biscotti complimentary
We had a table of three so we asked for a couple more after we had paid the check, they informed us they wouldn't bring anymore unless we were to re-open the check
If you're going to give complimentary things then make sure there are enough to go around!
Being as picky an eater as I am, I usually try to order pasta when I go to Italian restaurants
This time, I was advised to try either chicken or veal
Well, my sister and I ordered chicken and veal parmigiana dishes and split them
Both were spectacular
Pounded super thin, melts in your mouth, and the sauce and cheese just oozed off of them
Definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a nice chicken or veal, but you might want to come during somewhat off-hours, as the place gets PACKED, and the wait can be interminable
Oh, and this place can be a tad expensive
Definitely worth the money, but only if you have the money to spend!
Elio's is the Il Mulino of the upper eastside! It has the best ceasar salad and paglia e fieno
I love the upper eastside atmosphere
We often saw Derek Jeter there before he moved downtown
Many celebrities know of this jewel, but remain extremely low key because no one is there to celebrity watch
In fact, no one really cares because we are all waiting for our food to come out! We celebrate every birthday there and the food never fails us
We love it!
Elios is an exceptional restaurant
I have been there a number of times, and while at times the service is lacking some, last time I was there they were more than cordial
In fact, the waiter brought me a glass of wine to sample in addition to the bottle we had already ordered
The host could be a little more polite, however
If you are in the mood for delicate and delicious Italian meal with and upper-east side feel, this is the place
Make a reservation, act like you know what you are doing even if you don't, and most importantly, enjoy the exquisite food
The menu is interesting but doesn't live up to expectations - I've eaten better in less pretentious Italian restaurants around the city

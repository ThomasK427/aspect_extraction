If you are a food lover, you might be angry when you see the beyond reasonable check for a below average food
Also, they need to stop serving wet towls with chop sticks!(that's laughable if you ask any asians!)
My girlfriend recently took me here for my birthday
Our waitress was very polite and friendly
The food was phenominal, every bite was better than the last
The atmosphere reminded me of an Indian market place
The whole experience was just superb
Some of these reviews are mixed, but my recommendation is to try it out for yourself
If you are a New Yorker who does not like spending 4 hours to get through a weeknight dinner, being treated rudely by hosts (if we can even call them that) and getting service so bad that you wish you had just opted for a hotdog from the corner stand --- PLEASE STAY AWAY
We went out to dinner on a Wednesday night with 9pm reservations
We were seated closer to 10
Service was incredibly slow, noone asked how our food was, whether we wanted more drinks, etc
I took about 3 add'l hours to get through a regular dinner
Food is ok
Nothing excptional
Too many appetizing and accomodating restaurants with good scenes in NY to spend your money here
And the scene - well lets just say this place is getting infiltrated by lawyers/other suits with little concern as to the taste of their food
Although the four greeters at the door were a bit cool, the service and the food more than made up for the icy reception
Great decor, very friendly waiter and each new dish that arrived on the table - family style - was delicious
The approximately $60 per person cost seemed entirely reasonable for the neighborhood and the setting
I feel sorry for all anybody that thinks they have to go to a place like this for a trendy scene and great food
Thios place is touted for the celeb spotting (no, I dodn't see any) and the great food
I tried several of the small plates and although they were creative, they were nothing too special
And, the prices on those weren't TOO bad, but the bar drinks were ridiculous
I paid $14 for a teeny little margarita
I encourage everyone to consider one of the many great alternatives in NYC and avoid this place
I was worried based on the negtive reviews on here
but, I had a GREAT EXPERIENCE! The place looks amazing, and from the hostess to the coat check girl to the waitress, eveyone was nice and helpful! And the food is just delicious! Also, I made reservations for the night before Thanksgiving only one day in advice, expecting to get attitude, but NO -- it was very easy, and I was even offered 4 different times to dine!
They behave as if they are too trendy and too special for the world
I went there twice with a group and was terribly dissapointed by their inability to even pretend to look like our business was important to them
I could not get a reservation on the phone and when I arrived they would not seat us even though they were half empty
We were asked to wait until a communal table became available which did, two hours later
The food was good but not worth the disdain of the seating staff
I agree that this place is not worth the hype
Service was definitely below average
typical blunders included lack of water refills, mismanagement of space on the table, didn't check how our food was, took FOREVER to get the check, snooty attititude, etc etc
Perhaps she was just having a bad day
The food, not great
Halibut was tasty, but the Laksa had undercooked shrimp, and the soups were sub-par
Not worth it
Went on Sunday evening and was pretty disappointed overall
The ambience was great - awesome decor, and the service was good too
The food was the unfortunate thing
We ordered a number of things
The black pepper shrimp was awesome
The other dishes were either decent (Chicken/Cocounut soup, shaved tuna, monkfish), or downright horrible (the short rib dish was perhaps the worst I have ever eaten
Of the piece of beef, 75% of it was fat)
The food actually caused me to be sick 40 mins later
Perhaps we ordered wrong, but for somewhere which is so hyped, I was pretty disappointed overall
Lovely ambience, wish the staff were more gracious though! My personal favorites on the menu are the ovaltine kulfi kumquat mojito!! They absolutley satiate my sweet tooth

you walk into the place there are 2/3 guys in tight ill-fitting suits who look at you like you borrowed money from them and never paid them back
oh sorry!! they scowl and look irritated when you ask them if they have any tables
the whole experience was just horrible and embarrassing
what I would recommend is that the whole service crew gets intense training on customer service and relations
and get their job descriptions revisited
in that they need to be informed that the restaurant is a service oriented business
last but not least get rid of those smug and ill-mannered hosts you have at the door
in a nutshell if you are looking to be mistreated then pay for it
this is definitely the place to be
2 weeks ago, I decided to set up a birthday dinner in this establishment and was wary with the reviews I've read in City Search but it seems to be a perfect scene
It was and you could have been in a setting of Sex and the City but no celebs were there, the wait made you edgy even if you called in for reservations, still, the celebrant was pleased
Service was attentive that night and the food is average - not bad but too expensive for what you get
The trendy scene and beautiful people helped to make it an experience but I am a foodie by heart
My only gripe is that their chairs need to be replaced - some of them are broken and a chipped off edge scraped my pin stripe Dolce Gabbana pants - bummer!
If you're looking for a place where you can be surrounded by beautiful people and feel ultra-hip, Spice Market is your destination
However, don't come here for the food
This is a theme restaurant- the entertainment is high, the prices are high, but the food is mediocre
Of our appetizers, only the chicken samosas were noteworthy- delicately fried pockets of chicken accompanied by a flavorful green chili sauce with just a hint of heat
There was nothing distinct about the crabmeat salad or shaved tuna, both were cold stuff floating in a vague citrus sauce
Our entrees- pork vindaloo and vegetable curry
This was no vindaloo- no heat or complexity
The tender meat was overpowered by tomatoes (canned puree comes to mind)
The vegetable curry, underdone and the sauce, watery
Spice Market should make some attempt to produce some quality food to charge these prices
Jean-Georges's reputation is not enough
This is a super trendy restaurant, and if you want to experience celebrities around you in a classically decorated surrounding, then definitely need to dine there
The Food was really extremely average
Nothing to write h ome about, but it's not bad either
You can pay a lot less for the food elsewhere, but where else would you dine seated in between Nicole Kidman, and Valentino and Tony Braxton?  Inside tip, if you call for reservation, they'll tell you 11:30pm for a table
Just show up, and ask for a table near the kitchen, you get to watch them cook and great seats
Fantastic decor and ambiance
You just feel the right vibe when entering this place
Tried 4 different appetizers:The spring rolls were just perfect, Mussels like a dream, the fried hot chicken wings just awsome and the Samosas were just spot on!! Great timing between the dishes
Onto the etnrees: Pork Vindaloo was just a explosion of burning flavours, Duck was so refreshing and perfect, Striped bass (if i remember it right) with sweet basil and chili was truly incredible
All in all a top notch place with a world class kitchen and service
Truly impressed!!
A place you want to go to
Don't worry about a reservation
just eat at the bar (looking into the kitchen)
Service was not great but the food and scene made the difference
when my husband told me he scored a reservation I checked CITYSEARCH for reviews, etc
and was so disappointed to read so many negative comments that my husband and I started to argue about actually going
well, cooler heads did prevail when we decided to take a chance
My husband's reaction to on-line reviews in general is that most negative reviews are people who just like to rant and rave anyway
So
wait staff was very attentive, water glasses constantly refilled, food was good with good balance of spice, food did come out as they were ready but without any long wait between dishes,pattaya drink ( champagne with passionfruit) very refreshing
Our 25 year old daughter came with us and she thought it was great! Would go back again and yes, we eat regularly at some of the best restaurants in metro area
Poorly built, staff not optimally organized
At a certain price range, I expect the service, timing, and food to be fairly impeccable

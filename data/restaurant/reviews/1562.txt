However, places like this seem to think they can charge whatever they want
I, for one, am never wasting my money here again
The food is bland is simple and the prices are extravagant
You never knew healthy food could be so good
I own their cookbook too, but it's easier and better just to go there
Always get a muffin or cookie to go, you'll wish you had it later
Expect crowds during typical hours
Empty at lunch time during weekdays
Hearing good things about this place I was hoping it would live up to the expectations
Unfortunately the food is bland, the stereotype of vegetarian food
The soup was fairly good, the meal itself pretty boring, the dessert even worse
Stick to the soups
The staff are friendly and knowledgable
Don't sit at the communal table unless you want to engage in conversation with complete strangers
Over-priced
Average Food
Obnoxious staff
Most dishes could easily be made at home with a quick trip to your local organic grocery store (for a fraction of the cost)
All the ambiance of your corner Starbucks
I went to Angelica's for the first time with my fiance over valentine's day, and we fell in love! He is not vegan, but still could appreciate the fresh and mindfully prepared food
The service was perfect: attentive but not pushy, and the atmosphere was warm but not stuffy, it made for a very nice but not elegant evening
We ordered several courses of small shared dishes for an incredibly good price
You're even encouraged to bring your own wine! I highly recommend this restaurant, and we will visit every time we go west from the bay!
It's kind of expensive
My lady tried the editorial hyped Dragon bowl and I ordered the daily specials! Ah! It's just blah, blah
and bland
The service is fine but truly I can't rate service since waitstaff have good and bad days, and you know the saying is if it's not that bad, It's good
But not for foods, folks
Especially, when you convince your partner to go for that particular restaurant for that
special occassion! you would be silent for days when you walk out of that door
There are much better vegetarian and healthy eateries out there in the Village
Don't you egree?
Although I truly love to support vegetarian, health food and vegan establishments, i was somewhat disappointed in how Angelica's has de-evolved over the past few years
A few years ago I would have rated it much higher, but now - with other better choices such as Candle Cafe, Good Health Cafe and others, the dated menu, crowded atmosphere are spacey service is not the greatest choice
I truly love and admire the singles community table and other good traditions
I also like the desgn your own plates where beans and veggies and soy products abound, but other than that - I'm staying uptown
Go to this restaurant if you're vegan, for the healthy aspect, or for the novelty
But if you're not a vegetarian or not very used to this type of cuisine, be forewarned that this is a different type of eating and so don't expect to be immediately won over
By all means go with an open mind, but you may find it difficult to adjust to the blandness and, more importantly, the texture (crumbly)
Overall, the menu is hit or miss
I give them credit for trying to be inventive, but it doesn't always work
It's also a bit expensive, but I guess that's what you pay for food that's supposed to be healthier
I suggest you bring some wine so at least you'll have that to get you through the meal if you order wrong
This was the restaurant that showed me I could be a vegetarian, my favorite resaturant in the country as well!
Organic, unadultered, mouth-wateringly delicious veggie cuisine
This is my favorite restaurant in the country
Good for any budget
Prices vary depending on what and how much you order
Daily specials are a bit more and well worth
Take your appetite, the portions are large
The food (even the *chili*) is incredibly bland and overpriced for the portion size
Unless you're worried about sticking to a vegan diet, I could name 10 other restaurants (including vegetarian) in the area that are better
Perhaps, though, my disappointment is heightened by the fact that the smarmy host kept us waiting 45 minutes for a table
Get the croquette meal its great and very flavorful
I got the rice bowl thingie that was too bland
Dude, vegetarain food does not have to be tasetless
Take a credit card please, why do veg places have to do weied things like cash only
Makes us all look like weirdos
My friends love this place, but truthfully, the only thing AK has going for it is its continued novelty
Healthy, organic, macrobiotic food is wonderful
but not here
It's unimaginative and often bland
The lines are horribly long because everyone downtown is dying to be served by some of the waitstaff that is literally almost falling down from the weight of their faux-ennui
They're actually the most amusing aspect of the whole production
The food is fantastic, delicious, fun and healthy-imagine that
and you can bring your own bottle of wine
Sometimes hard to get a table, very busy Thurs
-Sat
Great staff, accomadating, very laid back
For vegan restaurant food, it's not bad
It can be a bit bland and crumbly
but, hey, that's vegan food for you
The reason I don't come here more often is the general ambience of the place
The waitstaff is vaguely chilly and sanctimonious
And the atmosphere is reminiscent of a food co-op in a college town
Maybe this is a draw for some people, but not for me
This is NOT the place to take your non-veg friends to in order to impress them with how far vegetarian dining in NYC has come
all the great reviews you read below are accurate
great simple cheap food
place is crazy cramped but fun all the same
they managed to fit about 15 people around 4 tables that normally would fit 10 comfortably
red chili pepper lights that hang so low you hit them each time you stand up
make friends with babu
I LOVE this place! It is incredibly tacky cheesy, but that's exactly what you come for, and it's also BYOB
They don't take reservations, so prepare for a wait
It's a tiny, cramped little restaurant, so you get to know your neighbors well, and you can't help but hit your head on the hundreds of chili lights dangling from the ceiling
The food is so good, and unbelievably cheap
Go for your birthday, and they'll turn on the disco lights and sing a Bhangra birthday song to you
So much fun!
One of my favorite restaurants! Tacky ambiance, dirt cheap prices, great food, BYOB, great service, what more can you ask for? Become a regular and you get star treatment :) Great place to take your friends on their birthdays, just be prepared to tightly packed in
Its worth the trouble
Crazy lights, wacky decoration, BYOB, Cheapy Indian Food while hearing hip/reggae/house mix of indie songs
What else you can ask for
Fun to go there for someone's bday and dont forget the booze!!!
Go here to experience the feeling of sitting inside a giant christmas tree, the food is SO cheap at around 6 bucks for a curry
The birthday celebration is very amusing, just pretend that it is your birthday so you can experience the indian tachno and strobe
Such a great experience - make sure you dont go next door by accident
Very tight space but worth every penny
BYOB
I am Indian and this is absolutely the worst Indian food I have ever had in my life

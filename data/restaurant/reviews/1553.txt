The tofu spread is delicious
The smoothies are also very tasty
I think they're clearly the best in the neighborhood, forget about tal bagels
now they've renovated the place and it's even better than before
as a little extra, you can get fresh bagels for 25 cents, mondays from 4 to 7 pm
Bagel Bob's is the best
The food is delisous
You should eat there
always crowded with long lines keeps the bagels hot and fresh
the more people that come, the more bagels they are constantly baking and selling
my bagels are ALWAYS hot and delicious
This place has the best fresh bagels ever!! and for some reason I love their coffee, even though i doubt it is anything special it really is great coffee! It always seems too busy but it isn't ,since it moves fast and smooth
It really is a remarkable place
I just wanted to give them a great review
I eat at David's almost every day
You can't beat the always warm, fresh, soft bagels
There's not a friendlier staff in the city
David's Bagels are worth the cost
The quality is much better than HH
My brother-in-law lives in Peter Cooper and after one particular rough night, we went to David's in the morning
My hangover was cured
David's bagels are so soft inside and tase good even if jut by themselves
Do yourself a favor and try their bagels
The bagels are fluffy and doughy, crispy on the outsides, but not too crispy that it'll hurt your gums when you bite down
full of flavor with the best toppings!
When I'm hungry for bagels, the first place I want to visit is David's! The lox spread on an everything bagel is to die for
Whenever my friends visit New York, I take them to David's for an authentic New York bagel experience
By far, the best bagel in the city
The bagels are HUGE and baked to perfection
We're talking about crispy outside, soft and moist inside, and FLAVORFUL! A must try!  I just wish they had a location on the Upper West side
I am still traveling cross town just for their bagels
Went to Essa-Bagel once and got major attitude from the employees, who deigned to take my order and then got it completely wrong
Tried David's nearby, never looked back
Excellent stuff
You'd never guess
It looks like any other wannabe New York bagel place - which wouldn't necessarily be bad
Just nothing special
David's Bagels, just below 14th St
on 1st, is quite simply the best bagel in the world
Crunchy outside
Warm, moist inside
Not too doughy
Just right
Consistently
Walk in
Order from the guy in the bandana (he's always there), and be prepared
Moan out loud
It's cool
Just don't ask where David is
I don't think he really exists
David's Bagels have the best bagels ever!! They are consistetnly delecious
I am obsessed with bagels that do not have holes
David's consistently are the biggest, freshest bagels out there
Who wants a bagel with such a big whole in it anyway! The bagels hold more creamcheese and other tasty toppings
If you want a guaranteed warm and chewey bage, David's bagels is waiting for you!
david's bagels trumps over ess-a h+h
i live closer to ess-a but i'm willing to walk the extra blocks to david's
bagels that are oh-so-good and a staff that's pretty damn efficient
though the premises can use a little tidying up
every morning walking to work is always too much
The bagels are always very fresh, and the staff are fast an efficient
Great value, best in the East Village by a long way
I was never disappointed at this wonderfully homy place
all the dishes we had were clean-tasting, fresh and never missed the spot
Service can be a bit slow, but they balance it easily with extensive friendliness
Overall a great place to dine casually (alone just as well as with a Mistress (((see previous review))))) ;-)
The food at Marquet was remarkable, but not in a good way
It was remarkably bad
The texture and the taste both were sub-par, both on my own and my mistress's dish
She had a decent sandwich for lunch there one day and I was free when she wanted to go for dinner
I was extremely disappointed
The staff was nice but extremely slow, and when they finally brought me my food I wished they hadn't
Avoid this place
Maybe it really is good for lunch
Or maybe she's crazy
Brazil meets Paris, in the food and the service
Quiet, charming, relaxed and superb in every way
Try it
Maquet is the best option for brunch in the village
The food is terrific, the service is quick and the restaurant feels like a pretty cafe
Make sure to make a reservation because it fills up quickly
twhat a pathetic attempt at a breakfast joint
Poor service, and cold, stale croissants and bitter coffee are the highlights!!!!   But here is a bit of advice for the pompous arrogant wait staff
when a customer calls you over to tell you that his well done egg white omelete is still raw in the middle, and shows you the egg literally running off the plate, dont be a moron and tell him that he had TWO (as opposed to one) bites so it can not be remade or removed from the check
you are the most pathetic excuse for a restaurant ever
and now hopefully more people will avoid your restaurant like the plague
I went there for brunch today, and the food was spectacular
The restaurant was crowded, but luckily we didn't have to wait for a table
Croissants were given with our meal and they were fantastic
You definitely have to check this place out! As for the service, we had no problems, and in fact our waitress was very attentive and quick
I've been to Marquet for Breakfast Lunch, and last week I stop it by, because I heard that they were serving dinner, so I decided to check out
They changed a little the decoration, the place is full of arts, the walls have paints from different artists, and some are for sale, overall was a very pleasant atmosphere
We order a bottle of Rioja wine, delicious
For appetizer I order the Pasteis filled with Goat cheese Toasted Pinenuts
very crispy and light, and for main course I had the Buttenut Squash Risotto with Crisp Duck Confit Pinot Noir Sauce
Brilliant
Dessert we all had the Famous Bread Pudding with Bananas Flambee, to die for
We're all very pleased
I higly reccomend
And I'll be back

The DJ at the bar kept the place alive
The only negative is that it's a little hard to find, but the hunt is well worth it!
I checked out askew on Friday night
they had a DJ that started around 10pm and the place got pretty hopping
we had a great time, ordered some food around midnight (gnocchi and ceviche were amazing) to keep the buzz going, sweet! the bartender recommended an American Flyer drink -- my girlfriend thought it was awesome
this is a cool place!
early dinner for 2 on saturday night
don't let the uber-trendy design and retro soundtrack fool you, the food here stands with the best in the city
the menu consists of small plates so you can sample many of the meticulously crafted dishes - we tried 8! ask about the ceviche of the day - the red snapper was delicious! try the 5-spice duck - the crispy skin was a wonderful contrast to the meat that melted in your mouth
too many other dishes to mention, but do NOT miss the apple strudel with aged gouda dessert - the unexpected combination sings in your mouth
go now with your all your friends while you can still get a table!
If you want a fresh take on tapas -- this new place should be on your list
I've always been ambivalent about tapas (too many remakes of the same Spanish or Caribbean dishes, etc), but askew was a great change of pace
My top picks -- bacon wrapped scallops in a peppercorn sauce and, (mom, I NEVER thought I'd say this) the artichoke in a white wine broth
Trendy design too -- especially in the front bar
It was a little hard to spot the place, look for frosted glass doors bordered in red
The food is decent, but not great! Food menu and wine selection is very limited
Food portion is too small
I do understand it's a restaurant that serves tapas, but they are charging tapas at almost entree price
I do agree decor is nice and the service is very good
But really need to work on the value and the price!  I see other reviews recommend group dinner at this restaurant
I guess if your group doesn't mind paying $80 per person for dinner and then have to grab pizza around the corner afterwards, then this may be a good venue for your group
Went to check it out after read it on Time Out New York
Really modern hip place
Food was suprisingly good! very fine
Try the egg plant!
Although some what hard to find due to lack of signage, this new place is definitely worth seeking out
Went there the other night with 3 friends
The overall ambience was hip and the drinks were well-made, but it was the food that truly shined
Particularly loved the mussels (the best that I've had in years), red snapper ceviche and poppyseed gnocchi
Will definitely go back
went to this new restaurant thursday night with 4 other friends
definitely recommend this place, especially if you're going with a group
the cool, crisp, but very comfortable ambiance struck us as soon as walked in
modern in a totally unique way
the food, which was served as small plates, was easily sharable so we go to try a lot of different dishes
we ordered their ceviche and gnocchi twice, was sooo good, one plate wasn't enough! great scene, great music, awesome food, decent service, but good looking waiters! cool bar!
went with a few friends on saturday night
place just opened
it was great
the food was awesome, way better than i thought it would be (the gnocchi and shrimp tempura were amazing, jerk chicken was really spicy and moist)
it was a cool scene, the place is really modern, but still felt warm and cozy
we just ended up hanging out there after dinner having drinks
Paul Liebrandt is one of New York's youngest chefs, but his cuisine is amazingly sophisticated beyond his years
I've dined at El Bulli and throughout Europe, and I must say that Gilt is pushing the bar in NY up to that level and beyond
I have a culinary background, and I was so enthralled throughout the evening
You must have the tasting menu
It is about 9 courses and it was mindblowing
The foie gras was the most beautiful and unique presentations I have ever seen
The loup de mer had beautiful summer truffles
The duck with cherries and morels was amazing
The cheese course came in three parts, combining flavors, textures and temperatures
I can go on, but you should just go there
So much of it is beyond words
The wine pairing is a great option, especially with such a multitude of dishes on the tasting menu
But, I saw so many wines that other restaurants only wish that they could have on their list
The dining room was full and it's pretty small, so make your reservation in advance
The service was great
They even brought me reading glasses discretely because they could tell I was having a difficult time with the menu
It was great European food and service, without the European snobbery
Although we ordered from the pre fixe menu ($95 per), as opposed to the tasting menu ($135 per) the meal was both extraordinary as well as equivalent to a tasting menu in ts breadth
Besides our orders, we were served numerous treats, before, during, and after our dinner servings, and it was all fabulous
The service was wonderful
The environment was a unique mixture of old and ornate - it's in The NY Palace - and modern, and all of it very intriguing
The dining room is breath-taking and ornate
The food is of equal caliber
Although the multi-plate course (5 plates come out each time!) is a bit overwhelming, and some of the preparation is questionable (what is the etiquette for eating a delicate slice of apple?), we had a great time sampling a variety of foods
We went for the Modern tasting menu
I can't say I liked every course, but I liked enough to leave satisfied
The cheese plate was exquisite- simply perfect
As expected, the service was second to none
Had a wonderful evening dining on delicious food
Higly recommend for those with an adventurous appetite
As an avid NYC Italian restaurant diner, I am always looking for new places to go, and Aquaterra did not disappoint
Excellent wine list; plenty of white wines to choose from and the food (had the Sunday Gravy) brought me back to the days when I was a kid and used to spend time in my Grandparents' basement in queens, chowing down on the finest italian cooking this side of the atlantic ocean! Aquaterra offers authentic Italian food that rivals my grandmother's own cooking, and why shouldn't it? It is, afterall, one of the few Italian restaurants in NYC that is actually owned and run by Italians
Benny, the maitre d', was very pleasant and made us feel right at home, and even gave us our after dinner drinks on the house
Friendly service, great food and a pleasant, upbeat atmosphere make Aquaterra a place that will, hopefully (if restaurant goers are smart), build its clientele and establish itself as a midtown mainstay
My fiance I have been looking for months for a place to hold our wedding reception
Numerous of ok very bland tastings that we didn't want to settle
On our last attempt we found Aquaterra, what a slice of heaven! The place is beautiful, Debbie is so understanding helpful, Tony the Chef is Magic in the kitchen! The staff attentive
I have never written a review this place deserves a higher score
Everything is tasteful , moist, scrumptious from our 3 course meal
Aquaterra I wish you many years of success, please don't change, keep treating your customers like their VIP
I've been to a lot of restaurants in NYC and this is one of the finest! Anything on the menu will make your heart leap with joy! The atmosphere is so elegant which is only further complimented by the courteous and knowledgeable waitstaff
(especially, Fernando
)
the gnocci was spot on
big chunk of meat(beef short rib)
perfectly tender succulent gnocci
the rigatoni with sunday gravy, what is supposed to be the signature dish was pathetic
The rigatoni was barely cooked
seriously
i think they threw dried ronzoni pasta into some boiling water
mistakenly thought they has used fresh pasta, took it out after 3 minutes
didn't test it
and just moved on
now, the sunday gravy
the idea is good
a red sauce with meatballs, sauage, and a beef short rib
but

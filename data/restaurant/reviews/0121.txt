House-cured meats are another must, but it's the pastas, particular the airy, ricotta gnocchi topped with ragu and chewy bucatini with homemade guanciale, that truly soar
Ladner's fritto misto, a high stack of crisp-fried seafood with heady herb coulis, rivals spicy lamb sausage for the best-dish crown
Dessert is all about the tartufo--a big hazelnut-covered chocolate ice cream ball
After waiting 40 minutes at the bardue to a friend arriving late and the restaurant's obnoxious policy of not seating uswe were seated at this long and loud communal table
Alas, Lupa is all hype
Everything we ordered was below par and too salty, and the dining experience equalled that of eating at a school cafeteria
The only good thing was our $27 bottle of wine
Save your money forget these celebrity chef-owned restaurants
We dine much better at Bianca pay a lot less
Coming from an extremely large, extremely Italian family, I am a pretty harsh critic of Italian food
Lupa was recommended to me, so I decided to try it with a friend, and I was soooo impressed
The foccacia they serve is delightful to start
And the gnocchi! I almost cried out of happiness
They were perfectly light and the ragu was just outstanding
The portions are smaller than usual at American restaurants (making it even MORE classic Italian, where portions generally ARE smaller), but the dishes are all fairly rich, so it is absolutely satisfying
Also, I tend to drink a large amount of water, and the servers were so attentive
My glass was never left unfilled
Really outstanding restaurant
We went with our 2 boys (ages 10 and 14) on a Tuesday around 1 pm
The waiter made us feel welcome, and since they were not overly crowded, he was able to take the time to bring me samples of wine before the meal and amaro after the meal to see what I'd enjoy
The gnocchi with sausage and fennel was delicious, and even the 10 year old loved it; the spagetti pomodoro had lovely huge chunks of garlic but was a bit too al dente for my taste
The carbonara was very peppery, and the pork with fennel was more than half fat, with very little meat
Those minor gripes aside, the flavors were simple and good
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and I'd love to return without my kids sometime
We couldn't get reservations for 2 weeks, but they told us that we can try stopping by
We did, and we got lucky
Once we were seated the place really filled up
Tables are so close to each other that waiters had no room to maneuver
I dont feel comfortable when trays are carried over my head
Food and service ware good
Our waiter was well familiar with the menu and wine list, and was able to make good recommendations
Loved Lupa a year ago
Went yestearday and everything was sub-par, not bad, but mediocre
Pecorina brusselsprouts tasted only from the cheese, baccala appetizer was like something from out of a can, beet with pistacchio was ok but could have used someth extra likelemon juice, Saltimbocca was dry and uninspired and the pasta not any better than all the million Italian restos around Bleecker
The waitress seemed annoyed wgen we pointed out the dryness of the meat, which is sooo wrong
Lupa still has a great atmosphere to offer and the host (male) was wonderful
But why slag on the food? Mario B should know!
This was my first experience at a Batali restaurant and I really wanted to enjoy it, but the place is so tiny and cramped that regardless of where you sit you're nearly in your neighbors' laps
Our server seemed more or less indifferent to us, which was annoying
The octopus appetizer was undercooked and tasted fishy, but the chicken ragu and the ricotta gnocchi were absolutely out of this world
However, the noise (this was a Friday night at 10 PM) was unbearable--every other diner in the place was shouting at his or her friends
It was so loud that the two of us couldn't even hear each other talk at a normal level
and this was in the (supposedly) quiet back room! I was not impressed overall, and can't say I'll be going back
from the friendly hostess to the knowledgeable bartenders to the accomodating matre d' to the attentive waitstaff to the charming decor to the OUT OF THIS WORLD victuals - a perfect dining experience from start to finish
it's no wonder that there were no seats available when we arrived at 10:30 on a post-blizzard monday night
finally a neighborhood spot that i can't wait to visit again and again
Lupa is one of my favorite places to visit
For the price you really can't beat the food
The menu is always interesting- on this visit we had cured meats (of course) and an amazing parsley salad which was a parsley and root salad with lemon and pancetta- out of this world! we also had a pasta pomodoro, which is consistently one of my favorites, the pasta is cooked just right and the sauce doesn't overwhelm the pasta
finally a pork loin with fennel that was done just right
simple food done well
if your looking for pomp and circumstance on your plate, then lupa is not the place for you
the servers are knowledgeable and the wine list is expansive
we had to wait at the bar for a table, but the atmosphere is bustling and is well worth it
An Italian food glossary in the back of the menu - it would be easier to just put the meaning with the word
It only makes sense that if your client is not Italian, clearly they would be force to flip back and forth for each and every item on the menu
Food -highly priced with mediocre taste
Do not order a side of squash - baked for so long, its like biting into ceramic
Oxtail soup, tasted like it came from a can of Campbell's
Pasta turned out to be ordinary, nothing to differentiate from the rest
Too loud, felt like a flee market
Tiny tables put too close together, little privacy, not a great place for a date
Mediocre decor
As we sat down on at table, we immediately noticed the wine glass was fingerprint tinged
tsk-tsk
Waiters walk around from blank expressions to frowns on their faces
Lupa is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan! The food is amazing, as well as the ambiance and service
I highly recommend it! And, my favorite time of year to dine at Lupa is Fall and Winter because it is so cozy! Enjoy!
This was my second time to Lupa
The first visit, I just ordered a couple of items off the menu and thought that everything was very good
This time my wife and I ordered the tasting menu
ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR!!!   First an anti-pasti platter that had 8 items on it
Then Gnocchi followed by 2 salads
For the Secondi, we had homemade salt cod and Heritage pork loin
Then 2 desserts
Every dish was meticulously crafted to bring out the best flavor
We wanted to finish all the food because it was sooo delicious, but we couldn't
Final tab, $200 and that included wine pairings with every course
An incredible value and some of the BEST ITALIAN food anywhere in the country!!!
Took 4wks lead-time to get a decent Saturday night reservation, but was well worth the wait
I liked how it was very traditional Italian and how they didn't attempt to bury everything in sauces spices
I went with the traditional Italian spaghetti served with oil, parmesaen and a lot of pepper and thouroghly enjoyed it
The service was impecible and the wine list top notch, as is the case with all of Mario's restaurants
Be careful not to order too much, I literally had to take 80% of my entree home as I couldn't stomach all the food
The best Italian I've had in the city
my brother and i got the tasting menu for $60 pp
the house-cured meats were excellent but the antipasti dishes were only ok
the gnocchi was superb - airy and chewy all at the same time
the main dishes (seabass pork loin) were avg
all throughout the dinner, my brother insisted the food was stuff that his friends could have made at home
the highlight of my night was seeing mike myers at the table across from mine! when his pasta came, he did a little dance at his table in appreciation
i should've ordered what he had
I've been here more than once and the food is fantastic! The atomosphere with the brick walls and intimate 'rooms' can make for a very romantic setting
The food is exceptional, from the variety of the house anti pasti to the delicious pastas and yes, try the tartufo for dessert! The waitstaff is the only inconsistent item, they can be a little less than friendly, but the food is really worth ignoring the occasional attitude here!
This place was absolutely awsome
Come for a loud, energetic, and fun atmosphere
A great vibe and even better food
I would recomend trying to get a reservation, (we did not) but they do take walk-ins
We had to wait an hour but it was well worth it
The wine list as well as the amaro selection was an added bonus

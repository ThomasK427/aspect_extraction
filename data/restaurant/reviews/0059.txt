it looked very odd on the plate
This Prospect Heights institution, with its old-fashioned soda-fountain type counter, complete with cakes of the day on pedastals w glass covers, attracts a diverse and loyal crowd
It serves amazing Dominican food and other yummy staples, including the best roast chicken and the best homemade lemonade
The pepper steak is to die for
Helpings are HUGE and most come with choice of rice and beans, or salad and plantains
You can either order from the small walk-in counter area (the guys are really nice); or eat in the no-frills restaurant area, where you also get free hot bread and butter
Best of all, it is CHEAP
The rotisserie grill in the front window belongs in the Smithsonian
Come at peak dining times and the chicken will the softest, juiciest bird you have ever tasted
The seasoning on the skin is just right, and the lime-based sauce is to die for
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $6
25
I ordered in beef w/ broccoli today for lunch
Considering their price of $6
25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was
I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there
was there for takeout friend recommended general tso's chicken today
not crispy at all and not spicy
now I am thirsty after 1/2 meal with heavy msg they had put in even after 3 glasses of water I drank so far
tried one restaurant before which closed down now
even take out it was cripsy when back to office
the service sux here
I waited at the counter after the order,
I had my number but they never called
I waited like 10-15 mins and being patience
turned out my order was sitting at the back of counter and those girls were just there chatting
they turned around claimed they did say the number but no one responded and said it's my problem that I didn't pay attention to hear them
BTW i was the only one waiting the order there walked in
Very poor service
not even an apology
Good food
Nothing special about this place
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit
Not a 9
8 rating!! more like a 8
1 Trust me on that
Is an Ok reataurant but not 9 or better!!! GOOD PRICES!!!
I eat here regularly and the wait staff and the food are consistently of the highest caliber
I always look forward to eating here
We often come with a baby and the staff is so sweet and kind to her, it is a joy to be there
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good
The fried dumplings are GREAT! Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
The food is reliable and the price is moderate

We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food
The best burger I have had in the Village
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark
I liked the beer selection! Wow over 100 beers to choose from
I will be returning
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years
Really cool stauff inside
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer
I was trying to impress my relatives that came to visit me out of town beleive they were very impress with the services the worst nightmare i had my 6 year old cousin they make us seat next to this drunk young adults
they were drunks and cursing out we orden drinks it took 20 minuts to get something to drink
beleive it me I want to leave but it was Raining very hard all night
the worst services 30 minuts to place a orden on appetizers we keep asking them for our drinks beleive after this i would never go back there again
I asked to change my table cause of this people seating next to us they told me it would take another 20 mints after i waited 45 mints on this table
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
I highly recommend it
I am going to the mid town location next
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
Please take my advice, go and try this place
Its located in greenewich village
You will not be disapointed at all
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
My girlfriend and I went Jekyll and Hyde for the first time tonight and we had such a great time
The puppets on the wall were making fun of my shirt all night which my girlfriend found very amusing
The server went out of his way to make sure we had a great time
I am allergic to certain types of foods and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and brought our drinks and food very fast
You have not seen this place you have to check it out
I will be back!
This was an unexpected find
Excellent food, huge portions, decor is unique and s\uited to the theme
Our host (an actor) was very enteraining without being pushy
Not a chain gimicky atmosphere
Bring your buddies or the kids
Very friendly
Dr
Jeckel and Hyde is not at all a place to go with a party of two
It's really a compact area plus the mood is unbalanced

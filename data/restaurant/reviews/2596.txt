Never again!
I just got my delivery of a cheese steak w/ fries and I have to say that I was shocked! The steak was cold and rubbery, the cheese cold and hard (not melted), the onions and peppers smashed in the middle under the half melted cheese, and the fries were cold, hard, and overcooked!!! I will not risk ordering from them again
I was quite hungry and I had to trash the meal
Maybe they had a bad night
but I was very dissapointed and I lost money too!
In a town where a good diner is no longer something you can count on, Galaxy stands out
It's nothing fancy, but in this clean restaurant you can guarantee yourself solid food and pleasant service
Go to the Galaxy Cafe while in town
Everyone in the neighborhood goes for breakfast, lunch and dinner
We usually order breakfast and their coffee is A+
But most meals are terrific
Ask the staff what to order, it's NY, they won't lie
And great prices!
Nice folks here, and speedy on the service
The food is decent diner fare and affordable
They do have a large menu of things along the diner lines, and they go a little gourmet on the brunch omelette fixins/combos
Service was superb
Unrushed and attentive
Waitress looked and spoke like PHD student
Meats are great
Deserts are tasty
Prices are very reasonable
Highly satisfied with food and atmosphere
There were 4 of us and all had the same good things to say about food and service
Stumbled upon this place completely by accident
What a great find
I love NY:)
This is by far one of the greatest restaurants in the city
We eat here at least 2 times a month and have never been disappointed
The service is fantastic and the food is authentic and wonderful
The restaurant is charmingly cozy and allows for leisuely dining and unhurried conversation
Friends often join us to find out for themselves what is so great about Chimi and are always impressed
I would like to start by saying I am a restaurant owner and have been in the business for 10 years
I have never seen service such as this and the attitude given when questioned
I realized that it wasn't just with the waiter but with management
I am a firm believer in appreciating the customer, this restaurant clearly didn't care about their attitude and knew the service was't their best but said it was acceptable because it was thier restaurant and they could run it how they wanted
Unfortunately for this Grill, they will have to realize that to stay in this business their attitude it going to have to change
I don't care where they are from and how they did it there, this simply won't cut it in NY
There are too many good restaurants in NY to waste your unappreciated time and money at this one
My family and I were excited to try Chimichurri Grill as we are Buenos Aires natives
When we sat down, the waiter barely looked in our direction and abruptly shoved our menus on the table
When my father asked the waiter if he himself was from Argentina, the waiter mumbled that he was not and walked away
Throughout our meal, the waiter was unfriendly, inattentive, and rude
While the food was great, the unprofessional waiter tainted our overall experience
And to top it off, the waiter forged in his own tip on the credit card bill when we left him 10% for such terrible service
I've eaten here a few times with friends, and everyone always enjoys the perfectly cooked steaks, the wines, and the pleasant service
It's a bit cramped, but otherwise comfortable and even romantic
I visited this restaurant a few weeks back and was disappointed with the food
The Calamari starters were served luke warm, however we were still looking forward to our steaks
I asked for my filet mignon medium rare, what I got was definitely more medium
One of my companions asked for his steak medium rare and got a very well cooked steak presented to him
For this kind of money I would expect that they would get the steaks right
Why bother asking how we want them done if you serve them anyway you want
I won't be returning
We walked by this place at around 2:30
Walked in and the server looked at us like we were aliens
Said they served dinner at 5
The menu looked good and we decided to give it a second chance after the theatre
It was around 11 p
m
and there was one other party in the restaurant
We weren't that hungry so we ordered appetizers and wine
Server told us that there was a one-entree minimum per table
He said that it was late so he would let it slide this time
He had a little conversation with the man behind the bar while pointing at us
I will have to say the food was good and the chance to sample wines not often found in other restaurants was a positive but the abyssmal service left a bad taste
This restaurant had been highly recommended to me by several friends (and strangers as I was examining their menu in the window one day)
I was NOT disappointed
The manager actually negotiated for a party of two to vacate a larger table to accomodate my party of four! The food was unbelievably good, lovely presentation, gracious, attentive service
Yes it's pricy and not very big, but totally worth a visit
Even the non-beef eater in our party loved it!
This place is a great find away from the usual nonsense of the Great City dining scene
real staff, bustling interior, cosy interior
Meanwhile, the food is tops without pretension
If you can't take New York City attitude from the staff or cramped quarters, then get out of town
;)
I went for dinner on a Friday night with 4 friends
The ambiance is casual with a few elegant touches and the wait staff was fantastic
The wine the waiter suggested was an Argentine syrah enjoyed by everyone, the filet mignon was a great cut and prepared as requested
Other steak entrees were equally satisfying
Dessert was great - excellent creme brulee and the lavendar flan was an interesting treat
All of us have already recommended this place to other friends and intend to go back
Yes, pricey for Ninth Ave, but the food and service are worth it
We had reservations and were seated immediately
Try to find a cheaper, more lucious steak than their filet mignon for under 22 dollars
Much better than most steak houses that start at 32! - granted, it's tight quarters but that chimichurri suace and frites are worth the clostrophobia
Make a reservation if going before the threater
Small space - my living room is bigger - but no more cramped than many Manhattan restaurants
The atmosphere is cosy and somewhat old-fashioned, a change from the hip and often loud places now springing up along Ninth Avenue
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive
The food was delicious if not very sophisticated
Certainly a place for meat eaters
The house red wine was a cut above what you usually get
It's a bit pricey for a Hell's Kitchen restaurant but not bad value and I enjoyed the experience
I will be going back
We had a good meal here - great steaks, attentive service, good wine
The surroundings are definitely cramped, but they can hardly expand the walls!
On top of this the service was awful and they hate Argentines
I'm sorry these other people didn't have a nice time, but I sure did
Yea, the place is small and the staff is attentive (read: on top of you), but I like the attention

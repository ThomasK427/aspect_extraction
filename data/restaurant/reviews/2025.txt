Or could it be that these are people trying to have a Sex in the City moment? Overall, this was a poor experience and I will never recommend Magnolia
Definitely not worth $1
75
Okay, folks, the kids in the Magnolia are incredibly annoying and some are zombified, but
those cupcakes! They are worth that pretentious wait in line
Go on the weekends around the afternoon hours; the cupcakes are constantly fresh because of the extraordinary demand
Happy eating
I came here last week and this place disappoints! Having sweet tooths, my s
o and I were both looking forward to the infamous cupcakes from Magnolia
Aren't cupcakes supposed to be fluffy and soft, with sweet but not tooooo sweet frosting? Well if you're looking for the perfect cupcake, just pass on Magnolia
Cupcakes not only were overpriced, but did not have the fluffly consistency we all look for
It was hard, bread like and overly sweet
I am not one to waste dessert but we threw away the box after taking a few bites of it
Please save your time and money and go elsewhere!!!
I have been eagerly awaiting to get a taste for these famed cupcakes so I trekked over and happily waited in line to get in
Upon arrival I quickly packed up some cupcakes and took some pictures of their delicious cakes
THEN an employee came up from behind and informed me that pictures weren't allowed
So I complied and put the camera away
I didn't know they had a protocol for cameras
BUT THEN he adds that if I wanted to take more pictures, I'd have to pay him money which would then go straight to his pocket
Absurd! Sure he has an accent but I got the gist of what he was saying
I quickly left, feeling quite harrassed
I doubt I'll return to this bakery ever again!
I live on Upper East Side and when I heard about magnolia bakery I knew I had to go and taste one! For months I would always have the wrong address and search for it with my friend who lived around the west village but nothing
Until one day in april, my friends and I had found it
I try to go there once a month or so
It's a good walk from the subway, 20 blocks
I should go the buttercup bakeshop it's shorter
Everyone describes the cupcakes perfectly and they shouldn't be very good according to what we all think a cupcake should be
Even when you're eating them you're like, Well this isn't very good at all?!
The funny thing is, you still want another one
And then you start to crave them
Its as if they're drugged
i just went to magnolia for the first time - we arrived on a saturday night around 12:15 and waited in a line for about 5-10 minutes - not bad, really
the interior of the bakery was charming and i liked the self-service option for cupcakes
there were no yellow cake cupcakes available, so i chose a chocolate cupcake with icey blue buttercream frosting - it did not disappoint! some people seem to think magnolia cupcakes taste weird and/or are overrated
icing and cake have never been very appealing to me, but i love magnolia
magnolia's adorable treats are a far cry from hostess (which someone mentions as being better in another review) and betty crocker versions of the dessert and this is why they're so famous
to sum it up - highly recommended delectable, precious, and old-fashioned treats!
I've never had anything but the cupcakes here, but that is enough to keep me coming back
I like the homey, self-serve atmoshpere, although things can get a little crowded at times in the small space
The cupcakes are so pretty (dainty things with pastel buttercream frosting and candy sprinkles or shapes) and they are an excellent value (given NY prices)
They are the perfect size; not so large that you get a sugar overload, just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth as a small snack
The frosting (the best part, IMHO) has a wonderful, light but rich texture and good flavor
The cupcake itself is definitely not overly sweet, but jsut right
I can't believe that others say that Hostess makes a better cupcake
That is like comparing a Nagel picture to a Modigliani
Oh well, if some think Hostess is better, that means more Magnolia cupcakes fro me!
We came from Austin to NY , took a long subway ride and walked blocks and blocks to wait in line at the famed Magnolia Bakery
Sorry to say, I should have saved my energy, and my money
We were very impressed with the line wrapping around the front of the store that we figured we were in for a treat, but we were sadly mistaken
The cake was dry, cornbready, and the frosting was rubbery and too sweet
They were beautiful cupcakes, and the service was great but it wasn't worth the $7 for 4 cupcakes and a long trek across town
A friend and I went to Magnolia to try some of their red velvet cupcakes
Unfortunately, we were told we'd have to wait an hour and a half for them to be cooled and frosted! Had the RV cake instead
Oh, was it gooood
The frosting is like nothing I've ever had
So smooth n' creamy n' light! And their banana pudding is EXCELLENT! As for the cupcakes, I really liked the vanilla
The chocolate, I won't be buyin' again any time soon
The staff are Greenwich Village-y
They just reminded me of Desperately Seeking Susan
Like, right outta that movie or something
I liked 'em
Next time the sweet tooth is gettin' the best of me, I'll trek over to the Buttercup Bake Shop which is near my job
Haven't tried them yet, but according to citysearch reviews, it's pretty much the same stuff
I am a nyc local and ive tried other cupcakes but magnolia's are the best with their decadent icing to the cake everything is excellent at magnolia bakery
Magnolia's is a very small restaurant which does not have a seating area
If it is a nice day there is a cute small park with many benches and tables across the street- a plus for high energy children
Cupcakes come out on large trays which are setup on a table
Customers help themselves, so your future cupcake may be touched before you reach it
There are a variety of different cupcakes to choose from as well as a decent choice of cakes
The workers are nice; you and your $1
75 cupcake will probably make it out faster then expected
The cupcakes are best when eaten with milk(but what cupcakes aren't)
The cake part is dry so I take off the bottom half of the cupcake and eat that part first
The remainder portion of the cake and the frosting are very yummy!   Try it for yourself!
My husband and I read about Magnolia Bakery in In Style Magazine and decided to head out there
Shocked by the line around the corner and down the block we figured the cupcakes must be good
and THEY ARE DELISH!! I love the cornbreadish texture and the yummy smooth butter cream frosting! Our faves are the yellow cake with pink buttercream and the yellow cake with the chocolate frosting
Paired with an ice cold tea or coffee and you will be in CUPCAKE HEAVEN!! Not too sweet and not too rich
just perfect for that lil' dessert craving
Two of my friends and I took a hike downtown to try out the cupcakes
2 out of 3 of us were really disappointed
They are not light (they are heavy like a muffin) which is fine, but the icing was very bland
Basically the muffins are cornbread with extra butter and boring icing
I was expecting fireworks but was not getting any
Their Red Velvet Cake however was AMAZING
The icing needs to be sweetened a little bit
but I recommend it
The cupcakes are so overhyped, even if I was hungry and had a sweet tooth I would pass on the cupcakes
Bad news
Remember your childhood and how cupcakes were probably the very best food
Well then the cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery is the very best of you childhood memories
They look beautiful, taste like heaven and make you dream about them forever
I went there once (big Mistake because I live in San Francisco) and now all I want is another cupcake
They are the standard to which I hold all other cupcakes too and all others have fallen, even the ones i made duplicating their recipe
If you go to NYC RUN!!! to the Magnolia bakery and buy back a piece of your childhood
I have problems regulating my emotions (especially negative ones)
These cupcakes were so dissapointing that I literally threw them on the ground and stomped on them
They're dry and flavorless

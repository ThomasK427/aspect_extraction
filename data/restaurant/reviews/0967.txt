Staff that is trying to make a buck, I understand, but as long as I enjoy my dinner
Too bad for a place that has such an atmosphere
In Short Owner Jenny Potenza named this neighborhood spot after her pet turtle, but that's about the only slow aspect of this baby blue-walled eatery
Young neighborhood guests fill the wooden benches or bar stools throughout the day as they stop in for specialties such as nutella French toast, egg sandwiches, spinach pies, and chicken meatballs
Reviews and thank-you notes clipped to a clothesline emphasize the place's popularity, and waitresses wearing aprons add to the at-home feel
this place is adorable
the food is all homemade and hearty, brunch/breakfast/lunch/dinner - all are superb
the new england decor and ambience is so refreshing in the middle of the city and the staff are charming
so you may have to wait a few minutes to be seated during peak times, but it's well worth it and the staff will bring you a drink etc
if you really can't wait - ask to sit at the bar to eat, same menu and it's just as good! oh - and don't leave without the homemade cupcakes! i recommended it to some outoftowners who were in the city
they went back every morning
can't say enough about it, i only wish i lived nearer!
came to this place with a bunch of my friends
the wait was forever long! good thing they serve coffee while we waited
the brunch menu seems reasonable
your typical brunch food
cute people everywhere
from the waiters to the customers
young crowd, but not crazy
waitstaff are so nice
one of them came over and apologized for the wait
it's not like it was her fault or anything
so she hooked us up with a side order of fries
i'm ready to try this place out for dinner one night
definately cute and popular, but the food is terrible
the cooks lack complete any understanding of how to prepare food
i haven't had the mac/cheese, but if that's what people here rave about, and if that's your thing, then maybe you should go
who puts cold cheese, cold ham, and untoasted/cold bread with cooked eggs to make a breakfast sandwich? to be fair, bakery stuff was fairly good
We found Penelope after doing an internet search
We'd gone to the Christmas Show and wanted to find somewhere less touristy and hopefully less crowded
Definitely less touristy
but mobbed
We thought everything was delicious
It's a funky little place
LOTS of young adults there
Great service
intersting menu
we will definitely go back!
I took a group of 10 women here on a sunday evening, and since they don't take reservations I called them day of to warn them
We hung out at the bar while we waited for the group o arrive and then were seated immediately
They were prompt in taking our order and all the food arrived at once! Everyone was happy with their meal, and the price is great for the portion sizes
One of the girls got some water dumped on her, but the waiter was incredibly apologetic and more than made up for it by comping her meal
I go to lots of group dinners and this was by far one of the smoothest
I will definitely take my husband here for the vegetarian options, although then I won't be able to flirt with the super cute bartender and waiters
This is a great casual place on Lex
It has a southern charm feel but in the city
The food is wonderful
but the thing I am most impressed about is the service
We went for brunch with friends and had to wait and when they came for us that thanked us for waiting, then my friend wanted to order the BBLT which was not on the brunch menu
The waiter was able to make it happen
The BBLT is excellent as well as the mac and cheese
I don't think the locals want to let the tourist know about this gem
This was, without a doubt one of the best dining experiences I've had in years
The menu was extensive and creative, the food was well prepared and delicious
My girlfriend and I shared the macaroni and cheese, a salad, an artichoke-spinach dip, and a chicken meatball sandwich
With every bite we were mesmerized by how delicious and unique the food was
The dip was the best I've ever had, the maccheese made me feel like I was down south at a world famous soul-food restaurant, the salad was perfect, and the sandwich tasted just like a beef meatball wedge
They had numerous creative and delcious wines and even allowed you to get a half a bottle, and if you got a full bottle, they allow you to take it home!  The decor was cute and comfortable and relaxing
The service was quick and very friendly EXCELLENT!
This is a great place for brunch
It feels like a homey breakfast place you'd visit while at the beach
The nutella french toast was decadent
There was a wait but they kept things moving
I've been living in New York for about three years now and let me tell you, it's great to find a place like Penelope where I can escape for a while
The decor is calming, the food is comforting, and, given the opportunity, their staff eagerly remembers a repeat customer
and sometimes even how you like your burger done up! I discovered the place about a year and a half ago and have gone in probably at least twice a week since
The prices, thankfully, match the feeling that you're in a small New England cafe (low enough to allow you to come back again and again)
I've only been in a few times for brunch as it does get quite busy, it's worth it though especially now that they have those amazing Blueberry Waffles
and that blonde kid waiting to take your name at the door
This is a great place to grab a light dinner
The sandwiches and salads are delicious
I'm told the desserts are as well but I haven't had the opportunity to try them yet! The service leaves a little to be desired, but the ambiance and food surely make up for it! And it's cheap, too
Encouraged by the long weekend lines and streetside chalkboard menu featuring Nutella french toast, we had been looking forward to bruch at Penelope
This morning we finally made it over to discover that the best part of the experience was the anticipation of good food
The reality was that we each paid $11 for some of the most mediocre breakfast food I've ever had the displeasure of eating
My poached egg with ham and fontina was one piece of tasteless sourdough bread, two eggs poached to death such that they were hard boiled, draped with one piece of cold deli ham
When I pointed out that poached eggs are not typically cooked solid, my waitress offered oh, we make 'em like that, so next time request them runny
We left feeling sorry for those in the long line outside - crowded and looks promising, but skip this one
I went there the first time because someone told me the food was great and inexpencive
I keep going back because I agree with them
My girlfriend and I continually come back to this charming little restaurant
An associate of ours (who happens to be a waiter) bragged so much that we came, we saw, we ate
and we became repeat clients
;-)  Great place for two
or even a group
We frequently have dinners with friends here
Favorite dishes? All of their salads and their mac and cheese
Fav Desserts? ALL OF THEM!
This place is super cute and the waitstaff give off a very relaxed comfortable vibe
Nice little menu
I've tried most of the menu and really like the food
The maccheese is good, and the green apple sandwich is tasty
I went with a friend
The decor reminded of that really annoy aunt that lives in the midwest
We went at night when the place had candles on every table that were brighter than the bulbs over head
I sat facing my friend and he sat against the blue wall
All this and wine cut down on the decor
The food was really great and cheap
It seems like a haven for single men with books
You are allowed to seat yourself and one of the single men sat next to us

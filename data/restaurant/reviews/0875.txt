the decor was semi asian with a somewhat gothic twist in my opinion (but thats just me)
the wine was decent and the food was not bad
for a group not looking for the whole nine in a nice downtown area, this is a place to consider
Pangea has great food at a reasonable price
The pitchers of cosmos and sangria are a big hit with the girl friends
The place can hold big groups but the comfy booths and candle lighting also make it a good date spot
Wandered over from Union Square looking for a place to dine before stumbling across Pangea
This restaurant's nothing flash, it's simple, comfortable and seems worn
The food was tasty and cooked perfectly
Nice flavors on my blackened fish and my friends chicken was juicy
There's a good cocktail list if you're up for a drink
If you want a good meal and don't need to be surrounded by beautiful fixtures, furniture, men in suits and that sleek modern ambience goto Pangea
Food is good, place is comfortable -that's what you're there for
After reading some reviews and seeing the restaurant in person, I had high hopes for Pangea
While the wait staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was definitely enjoyable, the food was absolutely horrific
My husband and I agreed that the taste and presentation of our meals had TV Dinner written all over them
This restaurant's cafe has always intrigued, yet slightly intimidated me by the fashionable poseurs at it's tables
I took the plunge and found a new home! Lurking behind that fabulous facade is a real neighborhood joint populated by genuinely sweet local writers, actors, designers, lovable odd-balls and assorted professionals out for a good time
The food wavers between simply good to fantastic, check the specials, that's where you'll find the exceptional dishes
Arrive in time for the early bird special and splurge on the Mohito's or wine! Some of the wait staff are to die for visually!  Pangea has made my transition from L
A
much easier
I still get to see the occasional star sitting at the table next to me but that's not the point of this place
Good food, good drinks, good people
The place may look cool, but it's heart is warm
Waitress knocks a candle into my suede jacket covering it wax - RUINED! This place tells me first to try ironing it out, then taking it to a leather expert, then if that doesn't work bring it back to be reimbursed
Long story short, I did what they asked and they still didn't reimburse! Go here w/ that special someone, just don't wear anything you don't want ruined!
I eat here regularly, and have always without exception, had consistently good fresh food and friendly service
It's unfortunate, but neighborhood places like this are a dying breed
Pangea is great anytime , day or night
I like going early in the week when it's not so crazy busy
The Moroccan Chicken keeps me returning for more
We had a party of 8 on a Saturday night at 7pm - it was totally empty when we got there (expected in NYC), but we felt like they were rushing us the whole time
Our initial waiter was really impatient with our orders, everything was served to the wrong person, we had like 4 waiters doing different things, and the busboy was taking away food before we could finish!! It totally distracted us from the good points of this place - it's a cool spot with great decor, food is decent and very affordable
But the wait staff has got to go!!
I went for a birthday dinner there
Service is good
Ambience passes for the village
Unfortunately, food was just not up to par
Even pasta was bad
If it wants to attract crowd, it really has to get its food quality up for nearby competition
went there with my friend on Wed night
their special menu is now $13
95 for appertizer and entree, NOT $12
95 anymore
but still a great deal for what you get
loved steamed mussles
very romantic restaurant
reasonably priced wine list as well
don't order cosmopolitan
it tasted very artificial (looked too red) and dont think it contained any alcohol though it costed $8 a glass
better order a bottle of wine
pangea is a great restaurant
the food is wonderful, there's a sexy ambience, and if you didn't know, there is a special $12
95 appetizer and main course menu that is available from 4-8 pm
it's a great deal! the only thing is if you sit we were placed in the far back room and it took the waiters some time before they took our orders
Great serving attitude from the waiting staff matched the great value one would get from the menu
Despite occasional loud groups, this place is guaranteed to provide a romantic and memorable dining experience
Always welcome, always a table, and always consistent quality service and food
Great place
would recommend to everyone
Besides the great service, the food will keep you coming back for more
The Scene Owner Keith McNally should bottle his formula: Uber-chic Balthazar and Pastis have long been the default hangout for the famous and fashionable
Here, he succeeds again
Wine bottles painted with prison-block letters line the walls; cool, flattering light streams through north-facing windows; and busboys with Heimlich maneuver instructions printed on their T-shirts--it's a downtown bistro aesthetic that makes every diner feel chic
Service is good and usually swift
The Food At dinner, a nicely gamey chopped liver mousse, watercress salad with blue cheese and walnuts, and meat loaf with mashed potatoes stand out among the menu's bistro fare
But it's brunch that showcases the kitchen's best work: From the eggs Hussard--poached atop ham, tomato and mushrooms, then doused with Bordelaise and Hollandaise--to the simple fines herb omelette and homemade doughnuts, everything is done well
For dessert, the sticky caramel cake is just about perfect
LOVED the cuban sandwich
Came here after a night of drinking in the neighborhood and this really hitt the spot
With 55 people writing reviews, its clear that this place is something to talk about and definitely worth checking out for yourrself
Its a unique space that's comfortable, serving comfort food
At 2:00 in the morning, its just as busy as any other time
Good for large groups, but it may be a bit too loud
My friends and I have been relishing Schillers since it opened several years ago
IMHO, the best steak frites in NYC
Most of the time the scene is loud, with attractive downtown types mingling with uptown foragers looking for good times
On a weekend I can't think of a better thirty-something singles scene
The size makes it difficult to get a table after 9, but it's worth the wait
The staff for the most part is cool, but there is definitly a brunette waitress there that works on the weekends that needs an attitude adjustment
The bartenders are pretty good
Brunch is decently priced and always very good
I would have to say that it's the best spot south of houston and east of allen for the collabo of scene and food
Was looking for a quick bite on a Wednesday night
Ordered the bibb salad and soft shell crab
The salad was somewhat overpriced
The soft shell crab was ok but more on the greasy side
It was hard to enjoy due to the extremely loud music
The waitress was very nice, though
A bit of a zoo but I guess that's the beauty of the place
Duck and fish chips were decent, nice server, good prices, cool old world bathroom
But crowded and really loud so you need to be in the right frame of mind
This place is New York
it takes a principle that has been sucessful (ie
Balthazar Pastis), and flips it to LES-perfection
On any given evening Schillers is full, uptowners, locals, tourists
yet it remains personal and special
The Hosts are always on top of things, the mixologists behind the bar can't be beat
and give as attentive food service at the bar as you would get at a table

When he mentioned that a pinot noir would be a decent match with two disparate plates of a first course (and the even further disparate second course- yes we informed him of our total meal choices PRIOR to our wine selection)
I allowed him to make a selection between two bottles of the same house, one costing $125 and one $175
When I asked the difference, he said this one was better, whatever that means as I cringed watching the words roll from his lips
The generally young and energetic staff is intrusive, trained in a mediocre fashion according to old world standards and noisy
Keep the kitchen quiet and save the jokes for the post prandial part of the night
I've been here numerous times for the tasting menu at lunch
The service and the food are consistently excellent- lots of small touches that really add up to a superb experience and meal
A little bit of a splurge, but definitely worth it
This is the perfect spot-- for ladies who know how to lunch 5 hours, for a family get together, for an engagement, you name it
Top quality class and service, and yes you pay for it
The portions are delicious and not too heavy; I highly recommend the tasting menu at lunch
OK, now time to go on a money diet
Most disappointed with the haughty service
I really do not need to be made to feel like the manager/hostess is superior to me -- there is nothing worse in a restaurant (or any service business for that matter)
That set the tone, of course
The space is a bit claustrophobic with the relatively low arched ceilings
The food? Not bad, but certainly nothing special in the context of NYC with all the great restaurants (without the attitude)
I would skip it if I was on the fence
My wife and I had several hours on our hands on a Sunday afternoon before our flight home so off we went down to Bouleys not knowing just what to expect
Upon arriving we were pleasantly surprised that we could get in and tho we felt somewhat under dressed the staff would not take no for and answer and seated us in the red room
All we can say is amazing! We had the $45 pre fixe lunch and every course was wonderful! The service is the tops with just enough converstation with the staff to be engaging but not intrusive! We were served a couple od dishes not on the menu and presented with a lemon tea cake to take home! We will definitely visit Bouleys again on our next trip! Th is was a greta dining experience!
what a relaxing place to have a nice meal, everything feels easy and cozy and not-too-little - not-too-much
i went to Bouley for the first time over the weekend
incredible is all i can say
i love the bread, i think i tried 4 or 5 different breads but my favorite was the brioche
it just melted in my mouth
the dishes i ordered were cooked to perfection and the dessert! oh my! i had the chocolate frivolous and it was over the top! my mouth was in heaven the entire night
i am looking forward to returning there, hopefully in the near future
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
C'mon, $35 to eat lunch @ Bouley
what a steal
All the food was perfectly cooked but it's the combinations that amaze
Where does he come up w/his idea's?! Bouley is alway's tinkering, perfecting
The man never rests
But back to the food
garlic soup w/langostino's, no peer's! Lobster, bouley has spoiled me
it's the only restaurant where I will order lobster
Rack of Lamd was as tender as could be
I can't say enuf
Go! Enjoy! Ask for Basil, tell Him Tom sent you
The food is absolutely amazing
The service too: they really seem to strive to make you feel special, all the extra treats make you feel like they are really thanking you for your patronage instead of trying to solicit things you dont want (like some $$$$$ places I could mention)
And the food oh my
Its the best French restaurant Ive ever been to; Chanterelle and Daniels are up there but this is better (in my personal opinion of course)
I just left feeling like I had had an experience and not just an expensive meal
It was a true pleasure from start to end
I went there with very little expectations about the service and they managed to lower even that! The front desk person gave us quite a struggle to find a good seat
She wanted to seat us at the worst possible seat even though the restaurant was almost empty
I have no complaints about the wait staff and the food was interesting because of the unusual combination of ingredients but not something I would call extraordinary
What stands out in my experience is poor service from the start and then ending the experience with my credit card bill where I find out I was double charged!
I'm a visiting chef intown for the james beard awards and dined on a sunday evening at bouley and must say I was blown away at the flavors and combinations that were thrown at me
This is a must try for the diner who enjoy's world class food
I would have to say it's on par with jean george in n
y
c
, I will return again and again when I'm in town
We celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary and Bouley and we were thrilled with our choice
The service was attentive but not overly solicitous
And the food amounted to one of the most memorable, inspired meals in recent memory
Particularly noteworthy is the black bass roasted in a scallop crust (the trace of vanilla is genius), the desserts, and excellent cheese selection
Put Atkins on hold and enjoy the wonderful bread
The wine list was impressive without being overwhelming, and of course we enjoyed the assortment of extras that seem to appear at every table
We hadn't eaten at Bouley in over five years - the food seemed to have gotten even better
The food simply wasn't good
The service wasn't good
The atmospher was ok
The best part of the whole experience is coming and going through the main door with the smell of all of the apples
No one ever asked how anything was even when a majority of food was left on the plate
There are so many other restaurants in the city with excellent food and service
It's not worth the trip downtown to be treated so poorly
It used to be when it was on Duane Street
If you go, definitly try the tasting menu
Everything was excellent and like a work of art
I never would have imagined some of the foods that I ate
I went with a group and we had a great time and no one went home unhappy
For $35, you get incredible food, ambiance and service
A thoroughly enjoyable dining experience
All dishes are intense, with a melange of subtle flavors and textures
Service is excellent
Clientele is sophisticated, but not not trendy
This is a place for folks with a sophisticated palate, and who desire a place that's about the food, service and ambiance, and nothing more
I highly recommend the prix fixe lunch!!!
I went here to celebrate with my boyfriend and we had a very nice dinner
The service was great and everyone had a great attitude
We had the prix fixe dinner with wine pairings and we loved it
The wines were great and they gave us ample amounts and the food was very inventive and creative and delicious
We both enjoyed our food and the desserts were great
This is defintiely a great place to go for a special occasion
BOULEY HAS EXCELLENT FOOD AND IMPECCABLE SERVICE
THE WAITER MADE US LAUGH AND THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY ATTENTIVE - THE FOOD WAS PHENOM - GET THE SEAFOOD SALAD (WARM BUT WONDERFUL) AND THE BABY PIG
THIS IS ONE OF NEW YORK'S TREASURES, AND BETTER THAN DANIEL, LE CIRQUE AND ON PAR WITH THE MORE POPULAR JEAN GEORGES
YOU WON'T REGRET COMING HERE!
A decade ago, the original Bouley restaurant was deservedly at the very center of the New York fine restaurant scene: the ever-changing menu expressed Chefs manic energy and creativity, waitstaff were nearly gleeful, proffering explanations of each surprising course as it arrived
Restaurant created todays uniquely-American definition of a relaxed, elegant, and superb haute cuisine experience
Now, tamer evenings retain some of the former wildness as in the successful, ineffable amuse of coconut sorbet, avacado puree and salmon roe! Lobster terrine also models clean sea flavors with herbaceous balance and delicate texture
Other dishes are carefully executed if now often-copied elsewhere
Desserts uneven: mostly ready for retirement - flavors distant; overhaul needed
Value is very fair especially vs
obscene prices at Mix or Atelier
Bouleys meals today may not be memorable a decade hence, but still earn a place on your roster for a dependable and fun special night out

My wife ordered the red and thought it was pretty good
From there on we just went with the flow
We shared the rib steak, huge but done to perfection with garlic
The chopped liver is the best
We were sat a little close to the keyboard player but the place was noisy anyways
You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy the experience but it probably helps
I just don't think it's my type of restaurant
The place is a throwback to an earlier age when we didn't know about things like cholesterol
The food was good -- juicy steaks, flavorful if fattening appetizers and side dishes
post meal TUMS/Pepcid required
The live music was great and the atmosphere was unique
but for me not worth the eventual tab and heartburn
A once in a lifetime experience
the dim sum at this place is great and sooo cheap
I've been going there for years and I don't think that they have ever raised their prices
also the best roast pork buns in town (only 50 cents)
I was sent here by a friend who works in the neighborhood and she said its the best cheap Dim Sum around
She did not lie!! Delicious food, great prices, and the Razor Clams were first rate
If you don't mind being the lone caucasian in the restaurant, you will not find better Dim Sum on a budget
The Scene Mammoth and multi-storied, the restaurant's decor consists of pink upholstery on glossy black chairs, tables for two, four, six and more scattered about, and the centerpiece--two golden dragons with light-up eyes set behind a stage
During weekend brunch, carts are pushed around the tables non-stop; weekday dim sum service is less frenzied
The Food Although a standard Chinese menu is offered, most diners come for dim sum
Carts here have pictures on them--handy when a language barrier rears its ugly head
Be sure to stop the steaming carts for pork shu mei and fresh fish balls
Don't miss the barbecue pork-filled buns--they're addictive--but skip the gummy, bean-filled steamed sesame buns
For the daring dim sum-goer, tripe, duck webs and chicken feet fit the bill
This place is consistently great, with fast service and so inexpensive
But the real pull is the pork bun
They have two types that are worth trying - the steamed pork buns and the sticky sweet pork buns
Seriously amazing
Resting on laurels
The food at the Golden Unicorn is quality and the crowd is steady which is why they don't and wont go out of their way to be courteous overly friendly or otherwise spectacular
They don't have to, the business will come regardless
With that said, the food is quite good and it's not overly crowded during the week
This establishment is a Chinatown institution, I'd bring people here if Jing Fong was too crowded
Authentic chinese food, great for a meal with family
Food is always good and the service is great
Always eat here when I am in chinatown
Certainly isn't the best Dim Sum in the city
It's not bad but this place is highly overated
In fact all the good dim sum is in Queens (and one particular place in Brooklyn)
The quality of Dim Sum in this city really needs improvement
If anyone's ever tried the Dim Sum in LA or San Francisco you'd realize what I mean
I've eaten here for the past 15 years
In response to all the complaints about service, you have to realize that you're in a busy Chinese dim sum restaurant
In my opinion, only at shi-shi (sp) dim sum places (or at places that cater to non-Chinese) will you get attentive service
Look at how other Chinese people behave as guests in this restaurant
One yells Hey, waiter, or might just hold out an empty teapot to a waiter without saying anything, on the mutual understanding that a waiter will pick it up and fill it with water
To the American culture, this is rude
In the Chinese culture, this is normal
How do you handle it? Just be persistent, but polite
As someone below mentioned, you are still a guest in someone else's culture
Didn't have other menu items, but had Dim Sum which we thought was below average: package tasting glue like shumai, fishballs were too fishy, nothing really tasted good
Not recommended
How does this place get a rating of 9? ~~Again: this applies to Dim Sum only~~
Rude, rude service
Basically we were ignored
Had to stand up and collar a waiter to get a diet Coke! Dim Sum were tepid to cold
Noisy beyond reasonableness
Bummer experience all around
If this is the best NYC Chinatown has to offer, go to Little Italy!
Its too bad the service at this place wasn't better, because it could be one heck of an establishment
The Dim Sum was pretty good and at reasonable prices ($26 btwn 3 people)
The decor is decent, very hustle-n-bustle with the service
On Sundays, this place is extremely crowded and expect to share a table with someone if you're in a group of less than 6
The food was overrated and cold and not tasty! And for some reason, the smallest dishes were stamped as special or large, which made a meal that should cost $20 cost over $40
The waiters were rude and yelling amongst themselves
This place used to be good
But I was just totally ripped off
Will never go back!!
Most Dim Sum eateries in Chinatown are not places where you leisurly consume food
It has always been a process of very high turnover
When I started going close to 10 years ago, there weren't English descriptions on the carts
One must understand that you are a guest participating in someone's culture
The food is always on point for me and my family will continue to enjoy it
Doesn't live up to the rating
Only the basics, not too interesting
Poor layout--multistory not as good as one big hall
Food is average and a bit more expensive than other Dim Sum in the neighborhood, but they do have a wider selection of choices
Seating is average
Service is terrible
Waiters are slow to clear your table, refill water or tea, and on numerous occasions I have seen and experienced waiters who have given their suggestions on what gratuity should be left
Several waiters typically look over the customers shoulder as they calculate the tip
Overall, the waiters are rude
Waiters are particular in who they will give better service
I have had both good service and poor service here
When I have had good service I have left 20-25% tip
But when I have had poor service, I have left 5-10%
If you do go to Golden Unicorn, please do not reward poor service as this will only encourage poor service
Food was not bad
Quite lotta of choices to choose from
However, service was terrible
Waiters were not responding to my request
Was rude when I reminded him of my request
Would go back only for the food, but not for the service
Not my #1 choice for Dim Sum
Food was excellent, portions were generous, and the prices were quite reasonable
Service was adequate, however the restaurant was noisy and the lighting was too bright
Good place for dim sum
They serve a little of everything and the picutres help distinguish the good from the bad

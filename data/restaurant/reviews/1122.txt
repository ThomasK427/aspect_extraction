i love the atmosphere and the food
on the other hand, i have never been there when it's crowded, so i can't advise on how the service/food is at that point
but i love to go there and would highly recommend it to out-of-town friends
DISCO FRIES!!!!! My only question is
WHAT ARE YOUR HOURS??? you are called DINER 24, and at the beginning of the summer there was a big sign claiming that you were now open 24 hours a day, but several times we have come after 2am and the place was closed
PLEASE stay open!! we need disco fries at 4am!!! and we promise not to be drunk, noisy, or european!
love going there after partying
good atmosphere, ok food, but not many places are open at 4 in the morning!
nice place
nice people
open all the time
these are great qualities but what sets this place apart is really the disco fries
if you are a french fry fan you have NOT had fries until you have had these
the truffled brie fondue is DIVINE and i wish i could get my hands on some to have with, oh, just about ANYTHING (meat, bread, veggies
they would all be fabulous!)
top with some fresh herbs and you are have one insanely good dish! one order is very, very LARGE and will feed many
TRY to refrain from licking the bowl when you are done
I had the worst service experience I ever at Diner 24
The waiters were stuck up and rude
The bartender was very nice and made great cocktails which was the only nice part of the experience
Being a waitress myself I know hospitality
The waiters were clearly talking about my table and looking at us
This made us feel very uncomfortable
The food is over priced but when you want to eat late at night it is not such a big deal
I will never go back there again because the service was that bad
They charged me twice on my american express!!!if you go ,pay in cash!
If they paid more attention to detail, this place would be good
I suppose it's good enough because there are plenty of drunk people who need a 24-hour place to eat comfort food
It's a cute scene and the service is pretty good, but it's not as clean as it should be
A new paint job and some touch-ups would be a drastic improvement
The food is OK in concept but a little weak in flavor
The food was great, small portions but well prepared, and tasty - I'd say worth the money
The drinks were a bit weak however, but not unusually so for what is predominantly a restaurant
As for the service, I was disappointed that the busboy swooped down on our table from behind and in two seconds picked up my plate - which had a little bit of food left that I intended to finish - without even asking me if I was done
I politely told our waitress about this and she was not only apologetic, but the manager came over a minute later and apologized and bought myself and my guest another round of drinks
Also, the busboy came a minute later and apologized
Definitely a sufficient response in my opinion, they more than made up for what happened
Regardless of what many may say, this place is worth a visit for the disco fries alone
That goes the same with the macaroni and cheese with breadcrumbs
The secret to getting great service is carefully picking your waiter, which you can request for when you are seated
The decor is nice, very trendy
This is a great diner alternative for After- clubbing dancing
Prices are a bit up there, more than your average diner, but you are getting more than average food as well
Our rude waitor gave my boyfriend's disco fries to the wrong table, delaying the meal by 20 minutes
When we pointed out the mistake, he gave us a lecture on how to order correctly
Excuse me? We'd asked for salads and fries all at once
Still, he insisted that we should tell him up front that we wanted the dishes at one time
Umm, what part of all at once don't you understand? What's worse was his vanity and sense of self-importance
Why pay nearly 10 bucks for an order of fries and a jack-ass waiter? Spend your money at the cute cafe right across the street instead, where the staff actually knows what they're doing
I have been to this diner on more than one occasion and each time I leave I try to remind myself never to return
The service is terrible and the food is not worth the long wait or the high prices
The wait staff seems more concerned with their sense of fashion than the poor quality of service they provide
If they make a mistake, rather than apologize they blame you for ordering in a way that they did not understand
In a business that thrives on service, I suggest they clean up their act
There are plenty of other great cafes in the neighborhood--please avoid this one
My dinner at Diner 24 is highlighted by rude waiters, overpriced food and unprepared dishes
No one person in my party of three had food at the same time
The dishes would be brought to the table in 20 minute segments from uninformed busboys
Twice I had to notify them that the food they were carrying to another table was for my party
My waiter was prancing around the floor to what seemed to be a model strut
My one hope was that he would sashay over to my table and assist my party
Alas we only saw him when he took our order and when he gave us the bill
My advice is to stay clear of Diner 24 unless you want to spend your time watching sad model hopefuls strut their stuff
First off, go with a friend that has been a few times, and pick the right waiter
The first time I went, I had never had such cold, careless service
I know this is New York, but come on
However, after going back with my friend, a regular, that knows who to ask for, I was very surprised by the friendly and laid back environment and really enjoyed myself
It was super busy, but our waiter still had time to chat, and knew the menu very well
He seemed to really care about the place and the people that came there
He had been there since the beginning, and my friend knew to always ask for him
But other than that, the food is always good, and everything else is consistent
Definitely recommended
well
i've been there couple of times - always after 3am
the food (especially burger) was always ok - nothing special - but not bad at the same time
i was kind of disappointed with the late night menu - it should be expanded
there's not that many choices available
anyway
i'll be back
the music is always great and the atmosphere is good too
give it a try and you'l see if this place works for you as it works for me
We met our friend for lunch at Diner24
He had raved about the duck meatloaf
We didn't try the meatloaf, however the food we did have was average and not worth the prices
The fires were decent, but from the bottom of the barrel
The Nicoise didn't have the eggs the menu promised, substitutions (provolone for guyere) were prohibited and omissions (no bacon, please) ignored; and when one of us asked for bread to accompany her salad, she was given two measly pieces of white toast twenty minutes later, and charged $2 for 'em
Plus the waitress was disinterested and vacant-eyed for no good reason
Here's our suggestion: either lower the prices, or improve the food and service
If you are looking for good American food prepared in an elegant and thoughtful manner, Diner 24 is the place to go
On my many visits I have been amazed at the high quality of the dishes, the delicious combinations of flavors and elegant presentation
Prices are reasonable and service is generally good
Seating is usually very prompt but expect a wait at peak times such as Sunday Brunch
There is a good wine list, and cocktails, though a little on the small side, are well prepared
went there with friends, their fruit cocktail was very special, and delicous
so creamy and fruity
I also ordered Fish taco
it was a great dish, the only imperfect thing was the music got a little bit loud
Defnintely going back
plus they are open 24 hrs, where can you find a 24hr diner with this kind atomsphere?
Went for dinner the other night

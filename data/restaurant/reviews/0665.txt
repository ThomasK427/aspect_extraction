I will never go back
After the attitude and the bad wine, we didn't even stay for the food
This place has amazing seafood dishes and the mashed potatoes melt in your mouth
This is my favorite restaurant in NY
It's small and quaint
With a great wine selection, it's great for a date, and for a party
Salt is great, underrated and underappreciated
It's very low key and unpretentious, but the food, ambience and service is top notch
The seafood dishes are excellent
It's a cozy place that's great to impress a date
The waitstaff are friendly and attentive but unobstrusive
All in all, Salt makes for a great dining experience
I went to Salt for the first time this weekend and the codfish with shrip is definetly worth it
I am so coming back for more
Delcious food and confortable environment make said that this is the best Japanese Restaurant i ever visit!!
PERFECT
PERFECT
PERFECT
The only word that comes to mind when describing the food and service at Hiro
When it comes to sushi, I go insane, that's why I like to try different japanese restaurants when I discover them
When I stopped by Hiro last weekend, I was amazed and speechless about their fresh assortment of sushi, sashimi and special creative rolls
It's the most heavenly fish I've ever had
Yes, I do agree that Nobu, Tamoe and Blue Ribbon serves great sashimi, but they come nothing close to Hiro
Must try: Hiro Roll, Black Pearl Roll, Sashimi Tempura
Hiro is worth going back again and again and again
you get the idea !!!
I have lived in the city for many years now and have sampled the spectrum of sushi joints from sushi samba to nobu
I have found the supposed hidden hotspots such as tomoe and yama and choshi and yet I am at a loss when comparing all the above cuisines to Hiro
I am afraid to post such a review for fear that my standing table might be lost in a sea of foodies but I must tell you that never have I tasted fresher sashimi, more creative rolls or experienced friendlier service
This is a true gem of a restaurant and I only hope that my table still waits this sunday evening!
Hiro is missing a few elements that make a good sushi resturant
1
The sushi is hard, cold, and way too big
The Monster sushi trend is over, sushi should be small enough to eat in one bite, the rice needs to be turned over every hour, thus keeping it warm and moist, and the fish must be IN SEASON!   2
A Sake list must include at least 12 Drys and 12 Kuriis
3
Specialty sushi is fun and inventive but it should never include condiments
Hiro is not that good, but they could be, by changing format to a higher quality of fish and chef, and by increasing the variety of fish by say: 40 types
I hope they get better, because the staff is really a nice bunch of people!
I have been to all the Nobus and Tomoes in NYC
Hiro's food is better than them all
It is a quaint restaurant with a refined interior
The secret is the food
There have been different interesting sushi specials every time I have been there (usually written on the board outside), especially the combination rolls
The quality of the sushi is superb, but the appetizers are almost better
The tri-colored sushi tartar, kani-su, and the soft shell crab tempura were extraordinary
The menu is extensive and there is much to explore, but I cannot remember anything on the menu over $10

I cannot say enough good things about Hiro, I am going back tonight
This place is SO good! Great value, service and speedy delivery too
The shrimp tempura roll is scrumptious, usuzukuri hamachi, kani su are also delicious! We love this place and are so happy it delivers
Excellent sushi at a great price
This is a charming restaurant in the East Village
I sat at the Sushi Bar and service was very friendly and attentive
The presentation of the sushi was beautiful and the food was good
I would definitely visit this restaurant again
Good value!
Hiro gets a 1 rating, but I'd like them to do well
The Owners/Operators are very nice, and have built a beautiful little restaurant
The food however, to put it gently: sucks
The rice is cold and hard, the fish is far from fresh, it's not cut well, the pieces are too big, the sea weed is chewy, it's ALL wrong
Please go to Blue Ribbon Sushi and sample their sushi, then go back to your restaurant and copy it
If only the sushi at Hiro were great, I think they would have a top establishment, but truly after eating sushi all my 61 years, this is the worst I've ever had
Intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service
The food is all-around good, with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level
(The sashimi is cut a little thinly
) It's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village, but it's a pretty solid one for its modest prices, and worth repeat visits
Zebu consistently has good and interesting dishes
I love their salad and the Morenga (a great veggie dish)
The restaurant is not that big and the atmosphere is warm
The prices are reasonable and the staff does a good job
When we found this restaurant tucked in between 2nd and 1st we were so happy because we knew it would become one of our favorites in the neighborhood
The restaurant has personality
Right when we walked in we were greeted by a warm friendly owner staff
We were treated like part of the family but not too much talking lke those people that don't leave you alone to even talk by yourselves
The artichoke salad was nicely marinated and it was finally complimented by a red snapper special and of cource dessert-crepes
Everything was great and I definitely recommend it to everyone-even non meat eaters (contrary to Zagat)
This restaurant was great find
Looked up online for the best Brazlian food and I was not let down
I went to the restuarant with a French friend and he certainly thought the food was up to par with what he's used to dining
Excellent service, yummy food, and the owner was fun to talk to
Because there were alot of people that night and service was a little hard to spread out to everyone, she kindly treated my friend and I to a Maracuja dessert treat all on the house! It was delicious
It was so good, I tried three of their desserts (a 1st for me) and it was all excellent
Favorite dishes: Entree - Churrasco : Desserts - Crepes, Maracuja, and Coconut Ice Cream
:) Go There!
There aren't many tables, but that just adds to thecozy and intimate feel
The outside seating area is also small, but perfect for the romantic couple
And the food is excellent
The yuca fries were perfect - a crispy shell surrounding velvetly starchy goodness
And the lamb skewers were juicy, not at all greasy, and the vegetables were sweet and provided a nice counterbalance
The carne coszda was tender and flavorful
Adding some hot pepper oil to the black bean sauce gave it quite a kick - be careful! Didn't have room for dessert, but will definitely be back to try the coconut mousse
we loved the food
just delicious
the diced beef and chicken okra dishes were great
tasty
outside sitting area is really charming
the brazilian drink was nice
service very good and friendly
we went on a week night so it was not very crowded which was great

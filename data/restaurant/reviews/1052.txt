recently had dinner with some friends at wolfgangs -- once i stopped staring at the beautiful tiled ceiling i got down to business and ordered some awesome food -- bacon was great and the steaks were cooked to perfection and had me dreaming for days after -- highly recomended especially for you carnivours -- gives luger's a run for their money and did i mention they take credit cards -- yeah!!!
We dined at Wolfgang's on March 24, 2004
I was a bit disappointed because I had heard it was even better than Peter Luger
The steaks, though very well presented, did not have the flavor of a Luger porterhouse
Not even close
My steak, ordered rare, was barely medium rare and the two others in my party, who ordered their porterhouse for 2 medium, received a rare steak
Side dishes were very good - German potatoes and Creamed spinach
Bartenders were very capable, but dinner service was spotty, at best
There are many better steakhouses in Manhattan and I would not rush back here
As a lover of Peter Luger as the greatest place on earth - it hurts to say how good this was
It is Luger with a better ambiance
They have it all - the bacon, the steak, the german potatoes, the chocolate sunday, etc
Make a reservation - already a 3 hr wait for a table
Great location, great food, great service - congrats to Wolfgang
and you don't have to shlep to Brooklyn! Excellent steaks in a great location, Park Avenue and 33rd
Delicious Steaks, excellent Grilled Canadian Bacon all taking place in a lovely setting without the testosterone of the typical men's club steak house
You can bring your wife and she'll like it
The Scene With its long zinc bar, plush couches and patterned suede walls, the lounge is a swank spot for midtown's cocktail crowd
But dip around the corner, into a clamorous room of curvy booths and glossy tables, and all pretensions disappear
Servers parade heaping bowls of shoestring fries and tall stacks of onion rings
Here, people have fun with their food
The Food Laurent Tourondel fuses an American steakhouse menu with French bistro sensibility and charm
The gorgeous (and gratis) cheese popovers are best followed by ham-stocked clam chowder, or signature BLTs oozing with foie gras, apple-smoked bacon and roasted tomatoes
Entrees are elemental: Choose herb-crusted, grassy lamb, seared American Kobe flatiron steak or buttery Dover sole, then select your sauce (three-mustard and horseradish cream stand out)
Sides, from creamy spinach to sauteed wild mushrooms, are stellar
For dessert, the tangy, fluffy lemon meringue is not to be missed
We made reservations over a week prior and there were only 2 times available, but once we showed up we were seated right away
The service was excellent, attentive, but not standing over you
The starters and appetizers were very good, there were four of us for dinner, my husband and I shared the porterhouse for 2
We would not recommend it if you like your steak medium-rare, the filet side of the steak was cooked perfectly, but the strip side was over cooked
Of course with the size of the steak we had the fear that some of it may be tough which it was
Our friends ordered the rib eye and filet and both gave rave reviews
And the desserts were also very good
I would most definitely come back again on my next trip to NY
I was very impressed
Great food and service for the money
The bead is to die for as well as the steaks
I would highly recommend it
Went back to BLT again recently and I am always reminded how much I enjoy the experience of perfectly prepared steaks and great service
This meal will not come cheap, but nothing good ever really does
The wine list is deep and our server was educated on the different varieties available to us
always good
My friend and I had a wonderful lunch at BLT Steak
The service was prompt, and the staff was available, but didn't hang all over us
We ordered appetizers, and shared a steak with sides
Everything was great
We were totally stuffed but still got dessert
I've eaten at Peter Luger's on Northern Blvd a few times, and I think BLT Steak has better food, better prices, and is just a nicer place to go
Bravo!! Not just hype here
Food Service perfect
Worth the money
Staff, room, small details all taken care of
This is not a steakhouse
Its a fine dining establishment that specializes in steak
And they are great at it
Would hate to see the typical Smith Wollensky or Mortons crowd overwhelm here
But plenty of men only tables to be found amongst the pretty people out for a great meal at a hot spot
When I enter a restaurant with such high ratings I often find my self disapointed, not the case here
Everything was as good if not better than I expected
The amuse that was sent out was fantastic, not to mention the famed popovers
My boyfriend and I shared the porterhouse and enjoyed every bite until we couldnt possibly continue
The parmesan gnocchi was my favorite
We will both be back soon
This place is not worth the price at all
The kobe beef in the sandwich was not tender, but somewhat tough and the herb marinated skirt steak (that was highly recommened by our waiter) was okay at best
On top of that we ordered medium well and got medium rare
There are better steakhouses to go to
BLT Steak was a decent steak house but there are many others that are much better
The ambience is great and better than most steakhouses
They also served other dishes other than steak which was nice for others
However, I ordered as I always do the filet and although it was good, the size was relatively small and the sides were just average
However, their prices are not average
Overall, it was a decent meal but overpriced
There are 5-6 other steak restaurants in new york with better food at the same price
I was very disappointed, the steaks, lamb, and short ribs were all  over done
The creamed spinach along with the Hen of Woods were so  salty it was uneatable
I must admit our server was nice  It might have been an off night, but I will never go back
Besides  spending big money, the food was just not good I can think of a dozen or so other steak houses that I would rather spend my money
THE STEAK HERE IS GOOD, I STILL PREFER MORTON'S OVERALL
THE SERVICE IS A LITTLE OVERBEARING AT TIMES
CONSIDERING HOW THEY FUSS OVER YOU, THEY STILL MANAGED TO GET THE LEFTOVERS MIXED-UP WHICH ANNOYED ME AS I TOOK HOME MY FRIEND'S WELL DONE FILET AND SHE GOT MY RARE ONE
GREAT WINE LIST - THAT IS THE ONLY CATEGORY WHERE THEY HAVE OTHER NY STEAK PLACES BEAT
DEFINITELY WORTH A SECOND TRY THOUGH!
BLT is a gem
The filet was absolutely perfect and the popovers were delicious
The $40 dollar bottle of merlot was excellent
It is so rare these days to get a steak exactly the way it should be
The atmosphere was also great and the service was prompt and courteous
I will definitely recommend this place to my friends
When my family and I went to BLT Steak we could barely make it down to the hostess because the bar was packed
Everyone sizes you up as you try and make your reservation
We were promptly seated and waited eagerly for our popovers
My friend and I shared the Porterhouse Steak for 2 and it really is for 3 people
We barely put a dent in it
My other friend had the American Kobe special for $65 and said it was good, but not worth the $65
The dessert was standard - nothing special
The place is great for taking friends from out of town to experience a little the NYC culinary life
No need to return in the near future
On Christmas Eve night, My Filet came in well-done while ordered medium rare The waiter did not even come back to ask how's everything
I ended up eating the well-done filet it was very dry - tasteless or flavorless

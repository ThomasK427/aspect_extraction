The food is just amazing
You must try the Duck Spring Roll or Frito Misto
Also, don't forget to make reservations
We did, we waited, but it was worth it
I organized a dinner there with my coworkers after reading some reviews I was worried that they would give us a problem because they were all men except for myself
They were totally accomodating and sat us right away
I loved the food I especially loved being able to order lots of little dishes
You must try the mini hamburgers they are out of this world
Once dinner ended the party really started going inside they were playing great music
I highly recomend this place
This place is ridiculous
Don't bother coming here unless you know the owners and/or bouncers because you'll just end up standing in line freezing your butt off
And guys, don't even think that bringing girls will help because they'll let the girls in and leave you to stand on the pavement
At least you can go to Hogs and Heifers or Red Rock West - which are real bars as consolation
One is located in the heart of the Meatpacking district, the new trendy bar and club spot
You can almost always count on long lines and a snobby hostess at One, but once you get inside (if you're allowed in) you realize it was worth it
The blue lights give it a club feel, as well as the makeshift dance floor and DJ booth
There are cushion seats everywhere as well as an entire alcoved area just for sofas and bottle service
There is also outside dining on some nights
All-in-all, One is very fun, but beware: if you are not dressed to impress (that means no blue jeans and baseball hats, people) you will most likely not get in
Also note that groups of guys will usually not be admitted unless they have a herum of beautiful women in tow
I love this place
My friends and I were just passing through the neighborhood when we noticed ONE
The bartenders there are so friendly
As well as the beautiful cocktail waitresses clothed in Versace (I asked, and it really is)
We spent the rest of the evening there drinking and meeting new people
It was great
I was at ONE this past weekend and the atmosphere was wonderful
I recommend eating outside
You can watch the people walking by
I spotted one celebrity
This was an enjoyable meal with a great atmosphere
Last week I came to ONE with very high expectations
Friends and co-workers have recommended this place since they've opened
And I must say
ONE met my expectation
Try the Celestial Platter
It's really worth it
Don't forget to make reservation
I had a great time at One, and I think the girl who does the door was just the nicest and sweetest hostess in all of NY (not to mention she's stunning)
She doesn't have an attitude and does a great job running the door
Even if you don't get in, its worth the trip just to meet her
My friend brought me here a few weeks ago, and I've clocked in over 4 visits since! This place has a very good vibe, people are high quality, and the girl at the door is very fair and one of the best in the city
She is always very fair and accomodating, surprising considering how busy the place gets
People who are surprised when they get turned down at the door should understand that there's limited space, and if you're rude or just look like you're clueless, then you probably wont get in
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE!
I was expecting your typical snobby, overpriced restaurant when my friends and I went to One
But the staff didn't scoff when we didn't have reservations, they kindly sat us in the lounge
Our waitress was attentive, the food was good and not too expensive, and the drinks were delicious
When I accidentally left my credit card here and realized it a few hours later, the manager [Ben] went out of his way to find it and arranged for me to pick it up the next day
Pastis and Spice Market can keep their snobbery: I'm going back to One
i had a party there in the private room one weekend, and the staff was so accomodating
the owner kept making sure everything was perfect, the waiters were smiley and pleasant, a change from the nyc stuck up waitstaff, and the girl at the door, did her best to get my friends through the huge crowd outside as quickly as possible
she offered that if i wanted to come out and grab some friends as i stood outside to smoke, that that would be ok
don't know many door people that talk to you in nyc, let alone one that does everything to facilitate your evening! i highly recommend having a party in the VIP room downstairs!!
I've been at ONE several times
This place was packed on Saturday with beautiful people
Since we didn't have reservations, we had to wait
The person at the door assured us that it would just be a little while
It was worth it
The service we had was impeccable
Everyone there was very friendly
And the service, the music, the people
AMAZING
This is one of the places I would definitely recommend for dinner and drinks
All my husband and I wanted to do was go to the bar and order drinks but the girl in front is so snooty and she said there's no room inside for us to even STAND by the bar
Finally after waiting ouside in the cold or 20 minutes, the very kind bouncer told us she shouldn't make us wait this long, so he let us in
She was full of crap saying there was no room
In any case, our 4 friends were meeting up with us and when they arrived, she wouldn't let them in either
So I came outside and told her they were with us and she was just so rude and I hate her
This girl thinks she's better than everybody else and that's a joke cuz why would anybody think that way working as a doorperson at a restaurant/lounge
I'm never going back
Just be subtle when you gaze at all the beautiful people here! The place is crawling with them
The food was excellent I'd highly reccommend it
Just make sure you get a few dishes and share (as well as make a reservation to secure a table)
One dish will not be enough
unless you're one of the many uber-thin models who frequent One
Great atmosphere in a chic neighborhood
After dinner, stay for drinks or head over to nearby places like PM or Lotus
What a great place this is
I loved how the food was served
The portions may be small
but theyre full of flavor
The service was excellent
My overall experience at ONE was incredible
Not many restaurant/lounge have made me feel so welcomed
I recommend making a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance
If youre a large party, you should definitely preselect your food
That way, you dont have to worry about it once youre seated
You can then enjoy the ambience and your company
All my friends have been asking me to have my birthday party at ONE
and although I prefer the quiet intimate house party, i did have it at one and it was the perfect evening
My girlfriend and I, with 4 other couples, had dinner which was exceptional, and very affordable too
and we stayed all night thru, as the night got louder and later we enjoyed the cocktails and music and the loungy scene
I decided to throw a party for my boyfriend and made reservations for 20 on Memorial Weekend Sunday
We arrived at 9 and ordered up enough food and drinks to make them very happy
Unfortunately for them, we would have ordered twice as many drinks if we didn't have to wait half an hour for the waitress between every drink
She probably felt she didn't have to work for a tip, since there's a 20% gratuity that is forced upon groups
To make matters worse, they decided to close at midnight
On a holiday weekend!! Mind you that this website says that they're open until 4am on Sundays!! Wouldn't it have been decent to warn someone throwing a party that they would close at 12? This place obviously isn't concerned with making money or making a good impression

We ordered a a cheese and meat platter and some fried shrimp to start with, and some salads as entrees
We didn't see our waitress after she took our order at all
And most of the time we had to chase down another waiter
It was difficult to get his attention by just saying excuse me when he would walk by
Our salads were brought out when we were still having appetizers
The duck salad that I ordered had hardly any duck in it
After we finished dinner, we stayed there for another 45 minutes trying to get our plates cleared and the bill
Very french service
I would not recommend this place
After sitting, we waited 20 min
to get asked if needed a drink
This is also when the waiter told us that half the menu was sold out
After ordering our drinks and food all at once, it took another 35 min
to get our appetizer
Half an hour after our appetizer was cleared, the waiter told us it would take more time to get our main courses
Then he disappeared
I finally cancelled our order, the waiter came back in 5 min with our plates
Unfortunately, I accepted the food
After all this cooking time for our salads, mine turned out to be completely empty of the main ingredient (duck)  After 25 minutes of trying to get the bill settled, we just hunted around and found the manager
He was nice enough to take our drinks off the bill, but frankly, I'll never get those 2 hours back
I actually mistaken this place for another restaurant here in LA but stumbled right in
What a great mistake
The service was so incredible
Everybody had a smile on their faces, enjoying themselves and dancing to the music (including the servers)
Our server was so nice
He recommended a few things, made certain that I loved it, even told me that I shouldn't be drinking my cappicuno with the soup because it'll throw off the taste and that he'll make me a new one afterwards
The entire night he made sure everything was right, including all the other people there
Not to mention they had a projection of Beat Street in French on the wall, the place just so friendly and welcoming and the food was comforting at a great price
A must try for all those in the Village, A
O
C
is a great place where I have already returned twice
The food is pretty good, and so is the service, though on my first visit I told the waitress I wanted my tuna black-and-blue and she had no idea what that was
Generally speaking, not overpriced, and not a risky bet for a decent meal
I wish they had live music - it would be a great atmosphere for some nice french jazz
Living across the street from AOC, I used to go here all the time, but the last time I had brunch there, a couple of weeks ago, our waitress started complaining about the 17% tip we gave her, saying it was too small
I was with a bunch of french people so she probably thought we were tourists, but I was REALLY pissed off this girl had the nerve to complain about 17% tip for a brunch (and this after waiting 30 minutes to get seated)! Don't think I'll go back for a while
Went in one morning while walking down Bleeker
Good food (the lamb sausage sandwich is tops) and the service is good
(Extremely cute waitress for those interested in that sort of thing) Solid Bistro all around and a good value
from the front of the restaurant, you see this small not so crowded restaurant, but you have to go to the back
there you will enjoy the most relaxing french restaurant
staff is friendly
goat cheese salad is excellent
my boyfriend and i ordered the cheapest bottle of white wine they have, but it was so good
no need to splurge on expensive wine
It's already become a staple meeting place for me and a couple of my friends
The staff could not be friendlier and NEVER pressure you to go quickly even when it's crowded
The food, feeling and atmosphere are authentically French -- which is probably why you usually hear as much French as English being spoken among patrons
Great selection of beers
Can't think of a better place than this garden to while away a summer evening with a reasonably priced Weihenstephan Weissbier, a pack of smokes and a good friend
I had an old Zagat's so I thought it was still Grove when I called
however the new team at AOC has done a great job creating a spot for eating and relaxing
There is a gorgeous garden out back (I swear they filmed a recent episode of Sex and the City here
) and the staff really made our experience memorable
Would definitely go back
Well, I've been going there for a few weeks for lunch every now and then
I normally sit at a table near the window and work from my laptop
I decided to sit at the bar one day and thats when I met the owner! Apparently he comes in quite often around lunch time to check up on the place
He is a very courteous person and was asking me for suggestions on how to improve the restaurant
Its nice to know hes not another absentee owner that will let the place go to garbage
The food is great and I always get good service
And on sunny days, the garden is PERFECT for relaxing
Being allowed to smoke outside is always a plus
Everyone is very nice and I always see smiles on their faces
Recently I had the most fabulous experience, twice


at AOC that left me wanting to tell everyone about my new find! Whether you sit in the beautiful outside garden in the back or the front restaurant itself - both experiences were perfect! The relaxed atmosphere lends itself to the perfect romantic date, buisness meeting (as you are never rushed, however the staff was always attentive without being overwhelming) or just getting together with friends
The food was outstanding, both brunch and dinner, and I understand that the restaurant is now under new management


I was greeted immediately each time and upon leaving the restaurant, the Manager waved good-bye with a huge smile, as she did with every customer! Bravo to them as they have created a new dining gem in the West Village!
Went to AOC for Sunday brunch
We were able to order right away -- but over half an hour later no food or server to be found
When a member of our party got up to see what was going on, she was ignored by every employee she could find
In the meantime, the host came to take her chair away and make her sit where there was no leg room
When her boyfriend told the host that she would like to keep her seat as it was, he grabbed a chair and slammed it down very hard on the floor
That was our cue to leave and go to a new place around the corner (Havana something?) which was great -- and even gave us free drinks after hearing about our AOC ordeal!
I thought this place was great! It has a very nice ambiance, the food was absolutely delicious, portions very generous and prices unbelievably reasonable
You definitely get your money's worth
The only negative - very limited red wine list
Hopefully this will change soon
This is one of those perfect East Village finds where the bang for your buck is pretty amazing
A few of the appetizers were in the $3-$4 range and were better than places 5x as expensive
Pasta we cooked perfectly and the Tiramisu was about an 8--a bit too much alchohol
As another reviewer pointed out, the foriegn bartender and waitress are, in fact, beautiful so you can almost forgive the less-than-perfect service
Sans wine, $35 and 2 people are perfectly stuffed (app, main, coffee dessert) how can you go wrong?
Excellent place and great ambience
Ernie and Sal are great guys, and when it comes to personal dishes and great food Stephano is all you need
Must try the creme puffs
Sal/Ernie, if you're reading this
Wish you all the best
And, great that you finally got the liquor license!
the food is really good and worth paying money to eat out
the cook is kinda nuts
and brunch is reasonably cheap
and yeah
i agree
the waitresses are hot

The food is extremely well prepared, and the service extremely attentive
I loved the appetizers, especially the Onam Kishti, and would also recommend the Lamb Pasanda
I have brought guests from India there, and they have been extremely impressed, and believe me, these guys are a tough lot
I've been frequenting high-end Indian restaurants in NYC for about 10 years and Utsav is one of my all time favorites
IMHO, Utsav is probably the only high end Indian restaurant left in the city which serves authentic indian food
Try the Lamb pasanda or the Mustard fish (to die for!) - Its also the only place in the city where you can get a real Rumali Roti
I had read the service was substandard so was on the lookout - honestly, I didn't see it
The manager was ultra polite and came by twice to ensure that my clients and I were taken care of
All in all - I think this place is great, but more importantly, my clients visiting from London were suitably impressed with the food
I can't wait to go back
We went to this restaurant based on a New York magazine review
We won't be following that critic's reviews anymore--the food was really mediocre, and the service was also slipshod
Please don't waste your money here
An experience i would definitely like to forget
The food was average, the service sucks and its about time these people realize that they are one among many more good or better indian restaurants around
Its is very disheartening for me to write this since i am an indian myself , but the truth is that their behaviour and attitude completely put me off
Well i feel if i had shown them my visiting card their service and behaviour would have been just the opposite
i will never go there again
NEVER
I've been to many Indian Restaurants in manhattan and I've finally found one which I can rant and rave about
If anyone asks me for an Indian restaurant I always recommend Utsav because of their great tasting food
It really tastes like true Indian food and not a cheap comparison
I'd urge anyone to go and taste it for themselves
Not to mention the ambiance is tops
eating on the 2nd floor overlooking the busy NYC streets always makes it more enjoyable
Our dining experience last night has left me sad to say the least
Not only was the service substandard,the staff kept looking at us surreptiously as if we were second class citizens
My feelings were confirmed when they delivered the check and two of the staff members kept (literally) peering over our shoulders to make sure we had the money
The check folder was promptly collected even before we took a few steps
It is sad that people from ones own country would treat fellow citizens with such cold contempt
I hope the rightful authorities read this post
The Scene The dining room evokes memories of an imagined France, with its cozy yellow walls, brown tables and heavily accented owner/host/waiter, who is friendly, enthusiastic, and highly attentive to the details of the meal
A mixed crowd--businesslike during lunch, young couples and singles at dinner--fills the thirty or so seats
The Food The menu offers few surprises, but its array of bistro standards is solid, satisfying, and occasionally delicious, particularly in the appetizer realm
Escargots in garlic butter are subtle and toothsome; vichyssoise is thick, cool, and savory
Among the entrees, the cooking is beautiful, but the ingredients can be slightly subpar
Cod grenobloise, sauced with capers and lemon butter, is flavorful but slightly dry
A tender hanger steak frites, served in red wine sauce, lacks zest; although excellently seasoned, mussels marinieres are poorish, stringy specimens
For dessert, the tarte tatin is a terrific confection of apples deeply infused with sugar syrup
My boyfriend and I went here for valentine's day
We were seated promptly, the service was good, and so was the food
It's a very small place, so be prepared to listen to other people's converstations at the tables next to you
No frill, good food wine at reasonable price, reasonable servise
I wonder why I did not find this place much sooner
Definately I would love to go back there - good neighborhood place
It's a quaint little place with cute bistro decor
Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I were both dissatisfied with the food
Her butternut squash soup, a special, was watery, and tasted exactly like the soup from Food Emporium
My girlfriend should know, since she orders this soup whenever it's available at any restaurant
She sent it back after two spoonfuls but we were charged for it anyway
Her salmon was tender but bland
My chicken in red wine sauce skimped in the sauce department and therefore was very bland as well
And the wait staff seemed like they didn't want patrons
My girlfriend, who is dieting and wanted nothing more than soup and a salad, was told that she MUST order an entree in order to stay at the restaurant
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
Look elsewhere
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar
Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros
The waiter was nice, great service
Cosy
Food was good and reasonably priced
I did not have any disasters at Cosette
Everything went as well as the restaurant could have wanted
This place is not a ten, people
I do not understand the gushing
The food was very obviously prepared and you could have done a better job at home
I've had steak tartare in about 10 restaurants in New York; this was the worst
It's staffed by French people, the maitre d' is very nice
But it's got to come down to the food in the end
Average priced for a bistrot with worse-tasting food
We went due to the ratings here, but think that the reviewers should try some other places before heaping 10's on this place
Try Le Madeleine for a similar price but much better food
Authentic bistro! Finally! Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit)
Bernard is a great host; it didn't bother me a bit that he recited the entire menu to my wife
All the food was hot tasty
2 soups, 2 entrees, 4 glasses of wine and one dessert cost $110 w/ a 20% tip
Go for it! You'll adore it
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
Fantastic place
Cute and decorative
A pleasant surprise
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
If you're looking for a romantic and relaxing place to dine but not too expensive on your wallet this is it
Delicious food and excellent service with a smile
I decided to take a chance on this rest
due to great reviews but was shockingly dissappointed with my dish but overall decent cozy rest
Of course everyone cant agree on everything but my dish chicken over the brick was a recommended dish but it came very dry and bland
It was so bad i barely touched my meal and i paid for it
My date had the ravioli which looked great
Besides the chicken the overall ambiance was great and expect a older older crowd
The service was very good which is always a plus
Just dont get the chicken!!!! to be honest not sure if I would go back there again

I am a regular, 91 -2x per month), and the staff is very personable
I often just go to the bar for appitizers and/or dessert and people watch
I often leave my choices up to the staff, and they have NEVER disappointed me yet
If you go say hello to Claudia at the bar
Great People
The food at Maya is a Meixcan dream
Each dish is well prepared and exquisitely presented
The decor is lovely, and the service is well-informed and efficient
There is no comparison between Maya and the other Haute Mexican places in the city (read Rosa Mexicana, Calle Ocho, etc
)
Maya wins hands down, on every category
Be sure to try the Pico de Puerco, you won't be sorry
Reservation was at 8, didn't get a table untl 8:45
It's almost like I just walked in without a reservation
The food is really good, but wait just unnecessary
Too crowded by the door - you feel like you're gonna get run over by waitstaff every 2 mins
The hostess even tries to sweet talk you to not make the wait seem as bad, but quite frankly the wait is BS!!!
this is definately one of my wife's an my very favorite restaurants in the city
sometimes a little too loud but the food
oh the food
exceptional food---------too bad so many people discovered it
This is Mexican? Outstanding
Incredible margaritas
Everything was excellent
Service can be a little lax, but food makes up for it
It was great from beginning to end!! The guacamole is incredible!! The appetizer sampler is great because it give you a chance to sample different options
There are so many to chose from
The food melted in our mouths
For the entree - Langosta y Camarones - was so tasty! I eat out plentyand always like to try different places andI will be back to this one
Now I understand the crowd there!!
Very creative
V
nice atmosphere
good for dates, but there was a bachelorette party behind us that seemed to be having a blast
(Could have had something to do with the giant male genital cake they were eating)
Yummy margaritas!
The best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in NY
I think it's much better than Rosa Mexican (except for guacamole)
I've been to Maya many times; each time I am impressed
Although usually bustling, the ambiance lends itself to romance or to just dinner with friends
I've always opted for shrimp/lobster/tuna entrees enjoyed my meal each time
Margaritas are the best I've had
who ever thought mexican could look so good? and taste good too
Richard (owner chef) is amazing in what he deleivers
Dishes are at the right heat level and always good
A must is the Chile Relleno the smoothness and flavor of the hot cheese is something to remember
original dishes served hot
Ambiance always bustling, but when you are seated, you are well treated
this great little mexican find has some of the best marguaritas outside of mexico
the food is ravishingly fabulous mixing both mexican and spanish flavors
the decor is also enticing from the bar scene back to the dining area
a definite must!
I have never been let down by service or the food at Maya
It is rated the Best Mecixan food in the city for a reason
If you want great food in a great atmosphere then this place is for you
ENJOY!!
We were hoping for a good Mexican dinner at a nice restaurant, but were completely disappointed
The place was very loud, over-crowded (the tables are squeezed in), and the food bland and forgettable
I've had better Mexican food at Blockheads for a lot less money--skip it!!
Creamy sauces on mexican food? It was a little too much
All in all, a good dining experience, but try to stay away from anything with cream
Just doesn't seem to work with mexican food
I love Mexican cuisine and frequently make trips to various joints offering such
Maya's menu was very impressive and I was pleasantly surprised to find out the meals were just mouth watering! Definitely recommend it! However, if youre planning on visiting, make sure you make reservations in advance; otherwise you will wait for a long time
Cafe Luka is a great neighborhood diner
It's friendly, clean, and the food is always consistent
It's always nice in the big city when they remember your face and Jon, the owner, makes it his business to say hello to you and ensure your meal has been up to par
His staff is prompt and attentive and Cafe Luka's prices are reasonable and the portions are generous
I definitely recommend having some brunch there or just an easy meal
I am lovin' Luka
Good but not great food and a very comfortable atmosphere
One of my favorite pubs
Decent juke box but can get a little too crowded with all the hospital staff
Not everyone thinks they are special and deserve a buy back just because they've sat at the bar all day and had 3 drinks and think the 4th should be on the house
I'd rather pay for all my drinks and let the cheap guys go somewhere else
I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, and I am aware when a restaurant needs a table, the proprietor might ask a customer who is finished with there meal for the table
but NOT when you have SIX TABLES AVAILABLE! That is the rudest thing! Yes I had finished my food, but I had barely been sitting for a half an hour
and was not taking up a big table or anything
The waitstaff is very sweet but the Owner is so rude
I can't believe he kicked me out
your typical diner, except that since it's uptown in the more expensive neighborhood, the price is a dollar or two higher than other diners downtown
no complaints, but no real raves either
Great penne alla vodka
Great Pizza
a little crowded, but a lot nicer than the UWS version
This Patsy's has got to be the worst one in New York !! The refused to let us make reservations the day before
When we did get there, they sat our party down 45 minutes later than our reservation time
The waitress then took another 30 minutes to get us water
On top of that, a friend had baked tiny cute cupcakes for my wife's birthday, and the waitress tried to charge us an extra $1 per person for bringing in outside food
Needless to say, we complained to the manager, who took finally off our bill
Afterwards, the waitress came up to us and said that she was right, and we were wrong, so we left ZERO tip for a party of 20 people
NEVER GO HERE !!
This Patsy's is a solid consistent performer
Great salads, the freshest most delicious thin crust pizza and very good pasta dishes
It gets a bit loud when it's crowded and be prepared to wait for a table at times, but it's worth it
If you have a group try the family sized portions for even better value
Bring cash
We go to Patsy's probably once a month, but the first time we went we did not realize it was cash only
Needless to say, it was a little embarrassing
Great pizza! Everything else is generic NY italian diner fare -- pastas salads

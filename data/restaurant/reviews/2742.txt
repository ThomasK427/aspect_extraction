My favorites are the hot sauerkraut, cucumber salad, and the beets
The mashed potatoes (topped with bacon, mmm) are hit or miss as they are often dry
Luckily, most entrees come with a choice of 3 side dishes, so you can try them all yourself
Best of all, most entrees are under 10 dollars
Top it off with one of many Polish bottled beer and youre in food heaven
The waitresses also happen to be super-hot Polish girls, if youre into that sort of thing
One evening I stumbled onto N6 street looking for a place to eat
I walked into Miyako and found it to be a small but quaint restaurant
I looked at their extensive menu and decided to try the man doo bok kee and sushi
The man doo bok kee are spicy pan fried dumplings
Unlike other asain cuisines it was not greasy but rather light and spicy
The sushi is extremely fresh
Ever since that evening 5 years ago I have gone to Miyako for the fresh food and friendly service
Don't underestimate this hidden restaurant!
Miyako is quite possibly the best place in Brooklyn to experience Japanese cuisine
From the sushi to the terayki the food is excellent and the service (with a smile) is unmatched
Everyone should experience this diamond in the rough!
The Scene A dark refurbished dining car hosts plenty of hipsters in carefully selected thrift-store clothing
At the end of the bar, you might spot a woman in a cowgirl hat and full Nudie suit
At the other end, perhaps a guy who looks like he just woke up under a bridge, a copy of his Farrar, Straus
even for a world traveler, this place is pretty good
i only have ever ordered off the specials menu, and never have been disappointed
Except for the fact that you can't get the same thing the next time you're there
The dishes tend to be more simple, and its crowded most of the time, but i think its worth it
Great for a date or for entertaining out of towners
I've never had such simple orders be so completley scrwed up! EVERY time we attempt take out, they mess up our orders in ever possible way
Example: Ordered a meduim well burger, no cheese, salad insted of fries
Got: Rare CHEESE burger with fries! THey have not gotten one dish right from any order
WHen you eat in its not much better
THe enitre staff have a huge attitude, mysterious LONG waits when its only about half full
Way overpriced, and the food is so-so
The staff really need to check the i'm a cool hipster and way better then you attitude, and learn how to complete a simple order
Stay away
I mean I guess for East Coast produce and portion and quality it was fair but taking a step back and looking at it from the perspective of a world traveler and food taster this food was WHATEVS
this place has saved me from cooking and i live less then a block away
Bless the hipster/hippies that make my food
the place is never empty unless it's their off time for two hours btw 4-6 pm
brunch is great and dinner is even better
at night the place is packed and the seating in the back is romantic
if you can try to ask for the corner booth in the back seating which has the most room
by 10 pm the place is packed both inside and out, and the scene is non stop from your hipster to yuppies
We ordered off the specials menu; both of our entrees were super good--inspired, hearty and uniquely tasty
The space was absolutely charming -- with its languid lighting and unpretentious furnishings, it felt happily forgotten and isolated under the bridge
Perfect 1st/2nd date spot--if you take the L train from Manhattan, you'll have nice, 10 minute transitional strolls to and from the spot
Have been to Diner three times, and still don't know if it's really worth it
The first time, our party found every dish to be a little bit off
the roast chicken was dry at the breast, the tomato salad had godawful cardboardy tomatoes, etc
The second time was a little better, although the selection presentation of the cheese plate was disappointing
poorly matched coices served in unappealing chunks on a plate rolling with hazelnuts
Small portions of the right cheeses would have been far more satisfying
The third time was the best, and we had a great time
Food was creative and well-done (I had monkfish poached in broth with lentils and fennel) and it MIGHT have made me change my mind about htis place
I appreciate their committment to fresh, local, small-farmed produce, and hope they can catch a groove soon
Brunch definitely outshines dinner at this cute little spot in South Williamsburg
Beware, it's not the cheapest brunch fare but it's worth the trip
You get hungover rockers, thirtysomething would be hipsters attempting the Sunday times at the bar, and some really good food
The egg sandwich is a local fave
Dinner on the other hand was not so good the last night I went as the duck was not fully cooked and there was too little meat on the bone
The guys sitting next to my table also had the same problem
My bloody mary was horrible and looked more like a cosmopolitan
In retrospect I should have ordered the pork steak
The cappuccino I had was unfortunately the best part of the meal
Definitely worth the trip from Manhattan
Really great food
Very well thought about specials! Add to that a very cozy and nice atmosphere, very pleasant service and unprentious patrons around you and you know why some make the trip from Manhattan
Just had my first meal at Diner and I was totally delighted! The atmosphere is adorable, like a small dining car from the Orient Express, but with mood lighting
But our meal was the real reason to come
The fries were the best I've had outside of my favorite Belgian Frites shop, and dessert
! The flourless chocolate cake with homemade whip cream was like liquid chocolate heaven
And sticky toffee pudding couldn't be more authentic
My only complaint is that vegetarians have only one entree and it changes daily, so if you don't like it, you're stuck
Also it can get pretty crowded so come early or very late
okay
so i've only been here for brunch, but it is great! though people say the staff are williamsburg trendy i've only had super nice and great waiters
they're fun and attentive, too
the brunch is possibly a best in nyc for the price
and the bloody mary's are perfectly spicy and strong
plus you get to sit in a cute little train car
i've heard dinner is amazing and will try it soon
In Short Organic-savvy hipsters flock to this homey cafe, with its hardwood floors and open kitchen, for hydra-pressed fruit and vegetable dishes, veggie burgers, tofu sandwiches and vegetarian BLTs
The Bliss Bowl--a large portion of brown rice, beans, kale, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, tofu, seaweed and tahini--is the specialty of the house
Grab a six-pack from the nearby Brooklyn Brewery or bodega: It's B

I love bliss, the staff is friendly, we go there so often they know what we want as soon as we walk in
Raw veggyw/ hummus rocks, chai w/soy best on bedford
Bliss isn't the problem it's the new snobs in the area are If your too good for us and our cafe's GO HOME!
considering my initial reaction to the rather exreme noise level (thanks to one particularly rowdy bunch at a table in the corner) and bland soup course was more like 'oy vey'
but I must admit, the food eventually won me over
Mom's cooking without the meat, the not-terribly-diverse but tempting nonetheless dinner menu is both filling and comforting, and the modest outer-boroughs price tag makes this place a definite return visit, particularly since it's only one train stop outside the city
I don't know why I thought I had heard good things about this place so when I passed it I decided to stop in for dinner
We had the grilled tofu sandwich, daily soup special, side salad with carrot ginger dressing and chili con pan
All the food was tasteless
As a long time vegetarian, I don't think I could survive having to eat like this
OK, I only went there once, but that once made me never want to go back
This was worse than bad college vegetarian food in the 1970s! And that's saying a lot
I mean, for starters, WAY too much salt
And then, downhill from there
I personally hate that kind of vibe these vegan-y places attract, but maybe that's just me, and YMMV

I met some friends here for lunch the other day
We were seated promptly outside which was great
Once we had our menus we were nearly assaulted by wait staff asking if we were ready to order
This place wasnt that busy so Im not sure what the rush was
Once we did place our order they royally messed it up
The wait staff got 1 out of 5 correct- not so good
Once we received the correct order the food was bland, boring and tasted like the ingredients werent all that fresh
So, basically sitting outside is the only thing this place has going for it
My advice- keep walking there are other bars downtown with much better food
Met a friend at this downtown restaurant and felt very comfortable
The bar area was fairly crowded but service remained friendly and efficient
We stayed for dinner and were very plesantly surprised with the quality of the food, service and prices
Initially, it seemed like an interesting place for a quick lunch
The hostess was a very sweet older lady
The interest stopped there
The staff forgot my girlfriend's food altogether as she waited for half an hour
My beer was never brought to me
Our water was never refilled
The waiter was MIA
We were generally ignored throughout our short visit
The poor service was rewarded by a minimal tip
Perhaps if we were wearing suits, our experience may have been more enjoyable
Before I went to lunch here I checked out citysearch to read the reviews, and was surprised to find only one
Once I arrived, I understood why
The restaurant was pretty much empty except for a few business lunchers
The service was surly and our waiter consistently mispronounced menu items
The decor looked like something straight out of the Holiday Inn and like the menu, desperately needs updating
For the quality, the place is also massively overpriced
All in all, despite the dearth of good financial district dining options, I would definitely skip this one
Papoo's is absolutely fabulous
The food, mamma mia! It's as if there was a little Italian grandmother cooking in the kitchen! In fact, Grandma rose's ravioli is absolutely delicious
Everything we had was top notch - from the delicately fried, and oh so soft calamari, the ravioli, the chilean seabass oreganata and veal marsala
If you live or work in the neighborhood you have to go for a meal immediately
If you don't, its worth the trip downtown, I promise!
waitress brought different food
I ordered medium rare shell stake but came weldone
Chef cooked again but charged $35
00 for one stake
Chef told us to bring free desart but charged
Tast soso and not organized service
I can not understand why this restaurant can exist this location
It was so great to find Papoo's again
We used to go to your restaurant at the old location
Your new place is bigger and better, and the food is even more incredible than I remember
You serve the best calamari I have ever had, and the Rigatoni with Vodka Sauce is out of this world
The service was attentive, and I love being treated like family
Everything was delicious, I felt like my grandmother was in the kitchen cooking
Recently had a wonderful dining experience at Papoo's
The staff was extremenly attentive
The food (Italian) was delicious and unpretentious
My shrimp parmigana with pasta was scrumptious
Papoo's is a hidden jewel in downtown Manhattan
I went to this place almost every weekday morning for the past year and will never go back again
I tried to have a perfectly calm, reasonable discussion with one of the owners regarding what I saw as an unreasonable pricing policy and he refused to even speak to me about it
I'm not sure how he's managed to stay in the restaurant business for 40 years with his attitude (and the food's not good enough to rate the Seinfeld treatment), but he's definitely lost one customer for good!
I had a bad experience with a rude man at the counter and when I called a manager to make him aware he took note of the problem and gave a free meal to make up for the situation
I would go there again
The pizza here is fabulous- I especially like the Neopolitan
Service is fast and friendly, and their pizza is consistently good! Prices are reasonable, especially for lunch specials
There is a large variety of pizzas to choose from, so try them all
Big Al's is the best pizza in Manhattan, for a pizzeria
Hands down
Between the service and the consistent quality, there is no where else to go
The Luciano slice is to die for, and Im not even Italian
Their Hawaiin version is even better
Its a 20 minute walk for lunch and well worth it
This is a solid Italian place with a steady, traditional menu
I have been there many times and will continue to return when in the mood
Overall, a good value for what you get
This is a restaurant that does not try to compete with the trendiest place on the block
Instead, it provides good eats for a mostly reasonable price
P
S
Make sure you check the bill -- sometimes mistakes are made!
Wasn't impressed
Came here late night on a Thursday and restaurant was mostly empty
Menu is large, but the selections are not inventive and the because the menu is mostly in Italian, it is difficult to decipher given the overwhelming list of entrees and waiter's hurried demeanor
While the service was attentive, it was not overly friendly
Tables are small and booth tables are shaped like ironing boards and cramped
With a hundred great Italian places in the city, this place is not a standout
Great food, great service and always interesting
Service is attentive without being intrusive and there are always interesting choices for the daily specials
Highly recommend
MY WIFE I HAVE BEEN THERE 3 TIMES SINCE CHRISTMAS-03--EACH TIME WAS A PLEASURE
I USE TO GO THERE IN THE 80'S--IT HAS ONLY IMPROVED MORE OVER TIME
Ecco is a true gem in lower Manhattan! The food was exceptional, along with the service
The staff was so accomodating and courteous
I will definitely go back to Ecco! As a resident of lower manhattan it was great to see the place packed and I even saw a celebrity! Go there, you will not be disappointed!
Fabulous food fantastic staff and great atmosphere
True italian cusine
Check out the bar area, great for a romantic date
You can literally never go wrong at Ecco Restaurant
The service and food quality are both extraordinary
The specials are always super fresh and tasty and there are always a lot of choices
Not only is the food tasty but the service is top notch without a bit of pretension
Ray, the host, is a true professional
This is an unknown gem, perfect for lunch, dinner, or private parties
Bello!!
I had the pleasure of dining there last night
What a great place

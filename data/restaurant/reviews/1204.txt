They're prices are high
They sell burgers for $9
00
I don't recommend their steak tidbits
This previous dinner tries to pull off a manhattan 'priced' stakehouse with dinner quality food
I wish I read the other review before going
My pork chop was literaly a soup bone which they charged $20 for
Even as a bar, they suck
Martini's should cointain 50% vermouth
Entertainment card members beware, the sub-menu is worse than the 'true' menu
We drove by this place in our neighborhood and it looked like a nice place
My fiance and parents deccided to give it a try
We walked in and right away you can tell that it is more of a bar then it is a restaurant
There were only two other people in there and none of the tables in there were even set up for dinner
Did I mention that they call this place a steak house? The waiter was this young kid, he sat us down and I asked him, how long has this place been open
He answered, bout a year
No personality what so ever, definetly shouldn't be a waiter
Menu looked expensive, screaming kid in back, guy on nextel in back speaking Chinese
We sat for 5 minutes, the kid didn't ask us if we wanted any drinks, it was too much we walked out
In Short Photos of Formula 1 champs decorate the tin walls inside this Columbia Street joint, and umbrellas shade picnic tables in the large and leafy backyard
The inexpensive French fare draws local couples and families--they've got mini burgers and chicken fingers for the kids
Grown-ups dine on escargot, goat cheese tartine, duck confit with melted Brie, and grilled hangar steak with red wine sauce, shiitakes and truffle oil
Finish line options include chocolate cake and strawberry tart
wonderful, peaceful and unusual
but please don't bring your kids unless they are really well behaved
badly behaved kids are not cute but annoying
This place the one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants
It's great for the kids with a big garden which includes some toys
great food, quaint little place - romantic ambiance - old wooden table tops, book lined shelves, billy holiday crooning in the background - PERFECT
for us uptowners who rarely make it down to the village - this place is worth the trip
the food was wonderfully balanced - juicy filet mignon in a cabernet demi, lobster mash potatoes, wasabi - ginger chocolate cake
the wine list is worth the trip on its own
looking for a nice quaint place to dine in - no need to go further than wildFlower
i recommend it - HIGHLY
attended one of their monthly tastings family style seating, we made some great friends - wild game french wine
the food was amazing - quail - stuffed with venison sausage - 10/10 - rabbit rissotto - 6/10, venison with jalapeno butter - 10/10, baked elk medallion 7/10
the best was obviously saved for the last - foie gras in a sauternes sauce with Chateau D'y quem
15/10
great service - Raquel was great - a must try for gourmets and gourmands alike
Recently attended with several friends for a birthday party
Warm and helpful service
Decor is comfortable and takes you away from the cold, concrete jungle outside
The wines are delicious and the boss Raquel is a wonderful curator through the diverse musuem that is their menu
The crab cake is the best I've ever had
The antelope was tender and full of flavor
Try the elk as well if you like a nice, smokey meat
Dessert was delicious and adding cumin into granma's apple pudding was an inspired touch
The chef Jay makes welcome appearances outside the kitchen to check on guests
A bit pricey, but worth the experience
I have been a regular at wildFlower for some time now and have to say that my initial impression has remained unaltered: wildFlower is one of the few restaurants that operates not by rote, with a veneer of friendliness, but by genuine, open intuition and willingness to engage with their customers as friends
The result is cooking that truly hits the mark, attention to personal taste and comfort levels, impeccable wine and beer pairings, and unparalleled service
Wildflower fills far more than a customer's stomach
On a recommendation from American Express for a date spot, I found this gem of a place last nite
Everything was just perfect
the wine, the food, the service, the dessert, the port
Especially if you like game meats, you will be in heaven
Raquel is the owner and treats everyone there like an old friend
I will def be back many many times!
exquisite food - presented decently (not extraordinarily) however the flavors, the aromas, the service, the ambience were outstanding
we were a group of 8
each of us had 4 courses
we shared everything - sort of musical plates
tuna tartar to die for - yak ribeye fabulous - beer braised brisket was definitely the best i have ever had
dessert menu needs a little work
the service was excellent
not often you see genuinely interested waiters in New York
a must try for food wine lovers
almost 6 months ago i visited this lovely restaurant
back in town again had to drop by for dinner
on a cold frigid night - there is nothing like a walking into a restaurant and being warmly greeted by the same waitress from a while ago
the menu seems to have grown - the food was excellent then is even better now
try the yak rib eye
for starters the crab cake was excellent - the mango chutney it was served with outstanding - apparently the chef's mother's recipe
apple pudding was wonderful too
do go with the chef's recommendations for wines by the glass
he know's what he is doing
The restaurant is called the Wildflower, which is an appropriate name considering it is surrounded by dimly lit city streets and street hustling restaurateurs trying to pull you into their establishments
There are sconces on each amber colored wall that create a tranquil glow around the room
There is a small opening to the kitchen area and the smell of home cooking permeates throughout the space
The chief is friendly and posts himself at every table to ensure that each person has a perfect meal
The waitresses work as one providing whatever specific need is requested
The best part was the food
City Search limits the words I can type so I have to just say it was perfect
New York was a little too crowed for me to want to live there, but I would visit again to have this type of experience
I had the fortunate opportunity to attend their November tasting dinner with a friend of mine who dines there often
First of all, the food and wine and pairings were amazing - especially the venison chop over squash
As amazing as the food was, it was thhe atmosphere that that was so unexpected
We felt like we were guests in someone's home sharing a meal with friends
Mind you, i had never been to wildflower before and only knew one other person there! Thanks to a wonderful evening, i now have a home away from home
I felt the need to write this review since citysearch is how my friend first heard about wildflower
wildflower, keep up the good work!
We ate there recently for Thanksgiving -- a special day when you'd think there'd be special attention paid to the food
not so
The lobster bisque tasted like a fishy salt soup
The other appetizers were measly -- one small crab cake for example
Rolls were served cold
Entrees seemed hastily put together with no real panache
Menu sounded exotic (lots of game), but unimpressive to taste
Portion sizes were tiny, service was nice, but very slow and inattentive (on their behalf, one waitress for whole place)
Although restaurant was cozy, seating was cramped and some tables very drafty

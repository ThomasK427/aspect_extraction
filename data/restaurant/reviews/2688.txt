It's a surprisingly tiny restaurant with excellent food and excellent service
In weekends it gets busy and there is a little bit of waiting
My wife and I had dinner at Kyclades last night and had a wonderful experience
We were made to feel at home the minute we walked in
Although we had a 15 minute wait, it didn't matter
My wife had swordfish and I had the lambchops
Both were phenominal
From soup to nuts, it was the one of the best experiences I have EVER had
The chef and greeter(the chef's wife) and waitstaff were phenominal
This place is a GEM
We will be back and making this a place we visit over and over
The Scene A dressed-up, all-borough crowd huddles under a grandiose awning, admiring the elaborate floral arrangements that line the open-air lobby
Inside, the dining room evokes a massive modern trattoria, festive and comfortable with high ceilings, enormous murals, and a blazing brick oven
Service is serious and swift, though you'll think the specials recital is never going to end
The Food Crispy flatbreads and excellent olive oil start the meal, but save room--chef-owner Rocco Sacramone's "abbondanza" means you'll be going home with doggie bags
Blistery pizzas topped with prosciutto, roasted artichokes and milky mozzarella are sharable starts
Homemade pastas stand out, and risotto arrives in a parmesan-crisp bowl that softens as you eat
Beware of overcooking and oversaucing: plump sardines arrive too-charred, and disappointingly dry Dover sole is spoiled by its gelatinous, lemony sauce
Chewy osso buco with pillow-soft gnocchi is hit-or-miss
Listen, I've eaten at just about all the Italian restaurants in NYC
This one is the best!!! so, make the trip to Astoria and enjoy a meal from a vast menu with a huge amount of daily specials to choose from as well
Manga!!!
Consistently delicious - service is fantastic
You will not be disappointed! Highly recommend the risottos
Tuna steak and lobster are incredible
I had no idea that such a great Italian restaurant was right in my own neck of the woods
The restaurant decor was very nice
Excellent (albeit long) list of daily specials
Wine list was also very good
Overall very happy with the experience and will definetely go back
Can't believe this place is in my own backyard and I just went for the first time this weekend
Great food, pleasant/speedy/friendly service
Very comfortable,  lots of variety on the menu - something for everyone
We went for my birthday and my boyfriend was very pleased
We'll definitely go back and I highly recommend it
This restaurant is hands down the best place I've been to for italian food in NYC!!!!! I've been there for simple dinners, my birthday, and occasionally get take out
No matter the occasion the service and the food are always superb! The fact that the restaurant itself has practically doubled in size since they opened is a testament to how great it is
The menu is very original, offering far more than just the usual spagetti and meatballs
It doesn't stop there, they always have a long list of speacials to keep things exciting
The people at this restaurant truley elevate food and hospitality to an artform!!! You have to taste to believe, whether your coming from down the block, manhatten, or even further you will not be disappointed!
I think this restaurant deserves more than appreciation
Astoria's BOOM place is the right way to call it
This place from the moment you go in gives you its warmth,first with their flat bread and sun dried tomato paste,with a big list of specials,and with a staff trying to do anything possible just to make sure that you enjoy everything from the moment you go in to the moment you are ready to leave
If you want to try something amazing Prosciuto and Figs is something TASTY,or you can try the pork shank with homeda pasta or even the Wild Boar Rack
Anything that i tryed in this place make me go back everyday
So my recomandation is DON'T THINK TWICE GO AHEAD AND ENJOY!!! You will thank me for the recomandation
This is an amazing restaurant
Especially the Branchino fish imported from Italy
This place has everything your heart desires
it's fresh, delicious, affortable and generous portions
Even they have lovely Italian-Mandolin Music with a Virtuoso Woman every sunday
I highly recommend it
!!!!
This place never fails to impress me
I've been during the fall/winter and had the pumpkin ravioli and recently tried the green apple ravioli
both are to die for
The bread basket comes with a sundried tomoato dip
its wonderful!!! There are several specials that change daily, which the servers recite from memory
very impressive
Well worth the trip to Astoria
I've been eating here since it opened and it's only gotten better
The grilled octopus is sweet and tender, the escarole with white beans is both healthy and delicious, and the pasta dishes are superb
The orrechiette with veal is my personal favorite
The waiters are very kind and helpful, and I regularly get something on the house - coffee, dessert or a drink
What I love best is they'll make anything I ask for, even if it's not on the menu
My favorite is a dish I've treasured since childhood, linguine with white clam sauce, cooked with pepperoncino
They have a great selection of wines, and have recently expanded with a Wine Bar around the corner that's accessible through the main dining room
I would recommend early reservations, or going mid-week
Now that word's gotten out, it can be difficult to get in
I went to Trattoria L'Incontro for the first time yesterday and was quite surprised at how amazing the food was
I read about it in the Zagat's and I just new I had to get there
Everything we ate from the appetizer to the entree was amazing
I would recommend the Risotto with pear and spinach, the lasagna, and the salads
The part of the meal that I found the hardest was to not eat so much of there fabulous bread and sundried tomato paste before the meal
After reading the positive reviews on here and in the Zagat guide, we had such high hopes for this place
The valet service is a great idea but I think dozens of specials is overkill
There are too many to list and everyone we asked for wasn't available (i
e
gemelli pasta, squash/pumpkin stuffed ravioli) The food was mediocre and the service was not good
Maybe we caught the place on an off day but I don't we would beg to differ about the recent 27 they got for food in the 2005 Zagat
The specials are consistently amazing
Everything has been consistently delicious
I have been there several times with different people and every one was impressed and would go back
The service is definitely top star
They even held my reservation when i was running over twenty minutes late
What really made this place stand out for me was the bill
After hearing all of the specials, you would think they were twice as much as the menu prices (as other places do)
Surprisingly, the prices were relatively the same
For this kind of service and food quality i definitly expected to pay at least twice of what the bill actually was
Would definitely recommend
We've been fans since it opened
I lived in Bologna for three years and this is the first (and so far only) place I've been to where the risotto is comparable
Don't be put off by the cheesy website: This place is NICE
I don't understand how this is not in the top 10 Italian
Perhaps its Queens address is partly to blame
I don't know
I have been there a few times and it's always an exciting food adventure as the oral menu changes often
It's really hard to beat
I have been to the top italian and I am not taking anything away from them, but Tratttoria needs to be included among their ranks! (Oh, great wine list by the way
If you like Tuscans go for the Morellino di Scansano)

Babbo lives up to its reputation for excellent and innovative food
The beef cheek ravioli was incredible
Meats were tender and flavoured without fault
The wine list is all Italian, but exhaustive and superb
Primary complaint was the service: it was slow overall, and I knew more about the wines than the sommelier
And, of course, a royal pain geting a reservation
Our waitress spoiled the entire evening
She was aloof and very distant
My main course took forever to show up
in fact it NEVER did
and I asked for the check
from another employee
because our waitress was nowhere to be found
The appetizers were good
their attention to wine selection was super
But given the poor service
I wish I had gone elsewhere
Service, Food and Attomosphere - just flawless! The selection of after dinner drink is also very impressive
No wonder it's awarded for the best Italian this year
How could this place not be on the top 5 list? Val
I had a terrible experince
The service was awful and the food was sub par
esp
considering the price
Ihave only three things to say about this place


OH MY GOD!! Went with two friends and we had the pasta/wine tasting menu
Absolutely the best pasta by far I have had here in NYC
The wine pairings were outstanding
Mario's enthusiasm for great, simple ingredients are showcased here
Just bought the Babbo cookbook and can't wait to start cooking this stuff up at home!
One of the few restaurants in New York where I actually crave the food when I don't eat there for a while
I love the wines in the mini carafes, the bartenders, waitpersons, sommellier, are all charming and are truly interested in making your meal a wonderful experience
The pastas are the best part of the meal
I really love this restaurant
The food is fabulous, the service impeccable, and the atmosphere divine!  The hard part is getting a reservation
The service is unbelievable, the food incredible
what more can you say? Mario Battali is the man! It's romantic, too-- go for a special occasion
The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable
If you can be adventurous,look beyond the ingredients and aren't looking for spaghetti and meatballs, Babbo is the place to go
After realizing our first choice restaurant was closed, we quickly had to pick another
With help from our Zagat's restaurant guide we found Babbo's
We walked right in and were seated immediately without a reservation
We were a little dissapointed at first to be seated upstairs, where the atmosphere is not as cozy and dark, but our table was private
We got the Proscuitto appetizer which was delicious
Dinner was the Ricotta Gnocci which was excellent and filling
My husband, concerned about the portion size, was not dissapointed when a huge plate of meatballs, sausage and chicken came, another delicious meal
The wine was great and service was perfect
It was a hot day and we drank a lot of water, our glass was always promptly filled
We found the prices to be very reasonable as well
Although it was not our first choice it was a VERY pleasant surprise!
The pasta was extraordinary, particularly the mint love letters that complemented the lamb perfectly
The flavors at Babbo are not subtle but rather more elemental
Everything is delicious
Against all common sense, I ordered the pasta tasting menu
Although it was extraordinary, I have to say that there is a reason that Italians eat pasta as a first course - too much pasta is just too heavy
That was my own fault, however
The flavors have the purity and verve of good Italian food
Excellent
The service and food were spectacular
None of the waitstaff were stuffy
The food and wine cannot be described with words
Try the mint lovers ravioli
My wife and I have been going to Babbo for 3 years now
We are still amazed everytime we go
Beef cheek, tripe, tongue, sweetbreads - you name it, Mario cooks to perfection
We just get enough - that's why we visit once a week
My only complaint is the waitstaff
Although very well versed on Mario cooking techniques and food presentations, they lack personality
My suggestion is to sit at the bar (bartenders are all really cool) and enjoy a great night of fine food and wine
Babbo is quite simply the best dining experience I have had in this city
The restaurant itself is lovely, the waitstaff/sommelier knowledgeable and helpful, the service impeccable
But most importantly, the food is amazing
Every single item we ordered was nothing short of perfect
The special squid ink pasta with rock shrimp and the stuffed porchetta were standouts among the other beautiful dishes, such as succulent grilled branzino, tender grilled octopus and beef cheek ravioli
The desserts were excellent as well, especially the light as air citrus sponge cake
BRAVO MARIO!
I come from a southern Italian Family and have ALWAYS been disappointed when I've eaten at Italian restuarants
But then Babbo entered my exisitence
I had the GREATEST MEAL THAT I'VE EVER HAD at Babbo (Aside from my Grandmothers)  The food is not quite traditional Italian but then again not exactly Nouvo-cuisine
Batali knows how to get to the essence of Italian cuisine without disrespecting it with new cooking fads
The food is SO flavorful that you have to wait about 3 to 5 minutes after every bite to fully get the flavor and depth of the food
What else can I say? Its other-worldly!
Incredible dining experience
Traditional italian? Probably not
Is it one of the best Italian places in the city? Absolutely
Call it progressive Italian, call it whatever you want
Anyone who doesn't like this place just doesn't have an open mind
Everyone says it, but it's true, the Beef Cheek Ravioli are amazing
We got to the restaurant 30mins before the kitchen closed, ordered our dinner which was absolutely delicious!! The choices are outstanding
The decor wasn't the greatest but the food and price make up for it
We will definately go back again
Visited New York this past weekend, and while looking for a place to have dinner we stumbled upon this little restaurant
It was small, but the food was delicious and a good portion for the price
The Pumkin Ravioli with sausage and cream sauce was absolutely one of the best dishes I have ever tasted
The waitress could have been more specific when I asked for a wine suggestion
However the little votive candle and rose at each table and the piano player make it a cozy, romantic and wonderful atmosphere
Just finished a tasty jerked chicken dinner that was too pricey for the subpar service and good, but not great food
It took way too long for us to get water and food and my sweet potatoes and soup were both cold

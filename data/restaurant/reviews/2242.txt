Please continue to partecipate in NYC restaurant Week
Laura M Gunther, Houston ,TX
I have read so many rave reviews about this place, I couldn't wait to try it! A friend and I went over restaurant week, so maybe they down-graded their dishes, but even the dessert was bad!! Everything was so tasteless! The best part of the meal was the complementary goat cheese and sauce for the bread! I would never take a chance and try again, it was that bad
On the plus side, the service was good
My wife, associate and I enjoyed dinner at Remi on Saturday night, and from welcome to good night it was an exceptional experience
We were greeted promptly and shown to a wonderful table in the main dining room, a place of beauty, with modern archetecture and elaborate murals
The service was perfect and our meal was wonderful
I had perhaps the finest buffalo mozerella and tomato salad - the cheese seemed to melt in my mouth, and the tomatos were red, ripe and sweet
My entree was the osso buco, which was fork tender and tasty, served over safron risotto
Desert included a fantastic cheesecake served with a poached pear half which had been sprinkled with sugar and put to the torch ala creme brulle
When in the area, this is a restaurant not to be missed!
This place was a dream come true!! Outstanding food with a charming ambience
Great range on the menu, too
From less expensive selections to Baby, it's my birthday! Very accomodating for our kids as well
Last night (7/6/04) I visited Remi for the first time
I was in NYC for work pleasure
I was truly impressed with the service, the food and the ambiance
I really appreciate good food and good service
Remi was recommended by others and I agree that it is a restaurant I would recommend
Keep up the good work! Thank you for providing an inviting atmosphere and good food (especially the rabbit)
I am in LOVE with Remi! I have never in my life had such magnificent service
The food was delicious
I ambiance was delightful, but nothing holds a candle to Remi when it comes to kind, courteous, and efficient waitstaff
We ordered off the restaurant week menu, which at other establishments means automatic second-rate service, but not here
They even sent over an additional dessert so we could try a wider sampling free of charge
I will certainly be coming back, restaurant week or no
The service here was particularly excellent and the atmosphere was very intimate, even as the restaurant started to fill up while we were there
The food was delicious, although the risotto was slightly hard for my taste
The veal carpellini (sp?)is also really rich in flavor
The panna cotta topped off my meal perfectly, especially because it wasn't too sweet
If you are going to go see a show on Broadway you should really consider going to Remi afterwards
The food is genuinely Italian and wonderfully New York
Plus, the decor is out of this world
You really feel as though you are dining among the stars at this mega modern restaurant
I recommend everything on the menu -you cannot go wrong
Made reservations during Restaurant Week for Friday, called to confirm, but the reservation had been lost
The host, however, was extremely apologetic and was able to accommodate us that evening
He also was able to arrange for a vegetarian entre, which was not on the RW menu, and informed the waitress prior to our being seated
Our waitress seemed less than happy about the prix fixe dinner choices and at one point said, Do you really need to hear the specials? As if her brusque attitude combined with her complete disinterest in our table wasnt enough, the vegetarian in our party was horrified when he bit into a seafood filled ravioli
Without and apology from our mirthless server, the plate was quickly whisked away
The food here was mediocre at best, however, I can highly recommend the Roasted Red Beet Salad as well as any of the desserts we sampled
You won't have a bad experience at Remi but you aren't going to be swept off your feet and recommending it to everyone you meet on the street
Remi was nicely decorated, clean, and staff was friendly
Staff had very little knowledge about wine, food was nicely prepared but flavor was average for this level of restaurant
The special that night was Venison with a Raspberry sauce which I do recommend and the Planeta wine from Sicily ($76) was delicious
I would give it 7 out of 10 stars overall
If you can't get in at one of the more popular restaurants I would give Remi a try, otherwise if you walk on by you won't be missing anything unique
Remi has great food minus the bass
The warm goat cheese beet salad was out of the world! The creme brulee is extra thick and the tuna cavaoli was great! The ambience is superb for a date; soft lighting, pretty linen, spacious layout
The waitress was very nice as well! The wine guy had a bit of an attitude, but overall it was very good
The foood is pretty pricey, but is def
worth a visit
The chef also takes extra care into presenting the dish in a pretty manner
I will definitely go back again!
i went on my birthday with a party of 6 and was seated promptly when my party arrived
given the wine list almost immediately, we picked out a very nice livio felluga merlot and ordered from the prix-fix menu
it had a nice varied selection and one of us ordered an additional crab cakes
the food was above average to very good, depending on varied tastes
one complained the beef filet had a bit too much cheese
the entrees were very good and tasted great
the deserts were good as well, having the creme brulee
overall, a nice place to dine and most were satisfied
if you have picky tastes, this might not be the best place, but for most, a good choice for a night out
This is a great place, especially so during Restaurant Week
The food was excellent, yet a few problems marred our experience: we received the wrong appetizers and felt rushed at the beginning of the meal in ordering drinks and wine; the prix-fixe desserts were added accidentally as a la carte choices
Both were remedied fairly quickly, but I expected better from what was usually careful suervice
Also, if I had not asked for the prix-fixe menu, it would not have been offered
These minor issues were more than offset by the fine food
Absolutely loved this restaurant
Expensive, but worth every cent
A genuine experience
MUCH RESEARCH FOR THE PERFECT SETTING FOR OUR CELEBRATION
CHOSE REMI'S BASED ON USER EDITORIAL RATINGS ON MANY SITES
8 OF 9 IN OUR PARTY WERE DISAPPOINTED
APPETIZERS WERE TASTELESS
FOOD, ON THE WHOLE, WAS FAIR TO AVERAGE
MY ENTREE WAS OUTSTANDING, OTHERS IN OUR PARTY WERE NOT IMPRESSED
MOST DISAPPOINTING WAS THE SERVICE
OUR WAITRESS HAD THE PERSONALITY OF A STOP SIGN, AND SEEMED QUITE ANNOYED TO BE WORKING THAT NIGHT
WE PURPOSLY ORDERED THE WINE WELL BEFORE DINNER TO ALLOW FOR BREATH TIME
SHE NEGLECTED TO UNCORK, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO REMIND HER TO GET GOING ON THE WINE! WE HAD TO PLEAD TO ORDER OUR AFTER DINNER DRINKS AND COFFEE TO ARRIVE WITH OUR DESSERT
I COULD GO ON
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE WITH SOME CLASS FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION, DON'T CHOOSE REMI'S
IT'S REALLY JUST AVERAGE
We were a party of 10 women who made reservations well in advance of our date
We were early and could not be seated so we went across the street to th Sheraton Hotel
When we were seated we were escorted to the rear of the restaurant to a table by a serving station and the kitchen doors
The restaurant was very cold as was the temperature outside
The pre -fixed menue was interesting with many choses in each category
The food was excellent and the portions werefairly generous
The service was very good and the value was excellent considering the quality of the food
The menu sounds better than the food tasted
It was nothing to brag about
The desserts weren't worth the calories
The architecture of the restaurant itself was beautiful though
For a casually elegant midtown meal, Remi is on the short list of stellar options
The beautiful, Adam Tihany-designed space is warm and inviting, and the staff operates like a well-rehearsed Broadway troupe--professional, seamless, efficient
One notable member, the charming sommelier, will treat you exceedingly well, whether you splurge on a pricey vintage, or limit yourself to one glass
And the Venetian food is consistently superb: any seafood risotto special is a must-try; it's even better than any I've ever had in Venice itself
All pastas and risotti can be ordered as 1/2 portions--which means you'll still have room for the delectable entrees, such as a succulent roast chicken and the best rabbit in town

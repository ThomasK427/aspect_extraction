two different kinds of sqares
However all things considered ELEGANTE'S IS THE BEST! Family owned and operated forever
Phil and Tony are the kings of Pizza
I've been a loyal customer for 27 years when their uncle Dominick first bought the place! Go there and ENJOY!
I remember eating here when i was 7 yrs old, best pizza I have ever had, the Square slices were my favorite, i am 28 now and back in Florida and wish I could have a slice right now, maybe I will take a special trip just for a pie
I dont know how they do it
but the squares rule! This is pizza that eats like a meal
I'm hooked, the squares are very addictive, especially when they come straight out if the oven
Long lieve elgantes!!!
UUUMMM! Just thinking about Elegante's Sicillian Slice wakes my mouth water
Staffed by Italians (an increasingly rare commodity in the NYC Pizza world), Elegante ranks tops in my book for texture and sauce on a Sicillian slice
Tastes best right out of the over, although reheated isn't too bad
sal's used to be the best pizza in the world!!! i've moved from brooklyn 4yrs ago, but if his son is running it now it's still the best
i say this because even when sal wasn't retired his son had been making the pizza for years!!!!! the only thing that could have changed since then would be sal's great conversation, and his fresh from his own garden escarole roll
YOu walk in and are greeted with smiles and friendly service
(The men behind the counter are cute, too)
They sing they laugh and if there happens to be a game on you here them cheer
Its full of life
They will make anything for you the way you want it
The food is unbelievably delicious
You should see when they spin their dough
This pizza shop is one o fhte best places ever and is a hiden gem in a small community
Bay Ridge natives know that Pizza Wagon has the best pizza
I used to drive here from PA when I had a hankering for real pizza
Now I live nearby and eat it at least once a week
You won't be disappointed
Theres nothing really stellar about their pizza, so I dont understand the hype surrounding pizza wagon
Slightly overpriced and Ive learned not to rate highly of places that put ice in their sodas
I come all the way from Montreal to eat at this pizzeria
It is small but that's what makes it so special
It's like going to cheers, where everybody knows your name
I go there all the time
Sometimes, I fly in to New York, pass by and pick up a pie or two and take off the very next day
It's that good
Kudos to the guys there
Amazing
This place is open until 2AM
I think this is the reason why I keep coming back for more
Great location for some late night munching
Oh -- and the pizza is good, too!
Pizza Wagon has the freshest, most evenly balanced (between chewey and snappy) Pizza I have EVER had ! Always fresh from the oven, Always FAST!  A Superior Pizza, ready for you to eat and run, or sit and savoy!  Can't get enough!!
Better than almost any Italian restaurant I have eaten at in New York, this place makes going into the city for Italian ridiculous
It's not cheap, but when you look at the food you're getting, it's a bargain
It's in a less travelled spot on 3rd, but the intimate setting is great and romantic
Great food (the veal is the best!), very comfortable atmosphere, and great service
What more could a person ask for? The restaurant was recently taken over by new managment and, having eaten there under the prior management, I can say that the quality of the dishes has improved
They have even just expanded to include lunch hours at very reasonable prices
Baci is truly a gem
I am looking forward to my next time back
Fortunately, my husband and I live in the area and are lucky enough to go to Baci as much as we want (once, sometimes twice a week!)
Even under the new owners, Nick and Sebastian, this restaurant is even better than before!! Upon arriving at the restaurant, you're made right away to feel comfortable and right at home in this delightfully cozy place
On par with any top Italian restaurant in Manhattan, the food here is absolutely fantastic (the grilled calamari, the cold antipasti, the puttanesca, the veal, the fish
all wonderful)
Along with the regular items on the menus, they also offer some wonderful specials--and if an item is not on a menu, they always do their best to accommodate
Never a bad meal at Baci
They also have a nice selection of wines and we always just go along with whatever Nick may suggest for us
And the Tiramisu
excellent!!
If you like gormet italian, you'll LOVE Baci! They have a STRONG daily menu and exquisite specials too! Owner Mario also sings opera during your dinner (if you ask nicely)
Great desserts, cozy, romantic atmosphere, and VALET PARKING! Mario also serves hommade drinks like grappa and this lemon thing he whips up
First date? Take her here and there will definetly be more to come
I agree that Lord's Bakery is the best! I've been buying my kids birthday cakes from there since their first birthdays (they are 17 and 9 now)
I also disagree with what was said about the neighborhood
I don't live too far from there and the neighborhood is like any other neighborhood
I bought my daughter's sweet sixteen b'day cake (red velvet) from lord's, it was delicious
My daughter is not a cake lover but she could not stop eating this cake, infact it was as though we were addicted; no-one could walk past it without taking a piece
We even squabbled over who would get the last piece
it was finger licking, belly rubbing, tall glass of milk to go with it goooood
Oh and I completely disagree with the previous review about the neighborhood I live there too and its not even like that
For my 16th birthday a couple of yrs ago my mom and dad got me one of the most beautiful looking birthday cakes I've ever seen from Lord's
It was pink with huge swans all over it
The three of us ate it for about 2 weeks straight, there was so much there
We bought a cheesecake last week for my mom's birthday and that was excellent too
The 40somethings that surround me say Lord's isn't what it used to be when I was a kid, bla bla bla but I think it's pretty damn good
Prices are decent too! Just a word of caution: I live 3 blocks away so I know this firsthand -- don't go into that neighborhood after sunset if you want to leave with your wallet and belongings intact
Like to turn up the heat? or like the flavor, but the heat gets in the way? ASK for spice adjustments or for special orders, if you think you'll need them, BUT most dishes are GREAT as the staff prepares them
Consider the TexMex alternative if you haven't already, or remember that variety is available for those in your group eating to a different drum
Only source for Pizza Rolls I know of
Individual stuffed pizzas, minimum 3 of their extensive toppings; delivered quartered
Never disappointed by any item ordered
Prompt local delivery, minimal seating and counter space
The Scene Rows of glass-topped, red-tableclothed tables stretch back to the rear of the brightly lit space, whose white walls hold a few seafaring decorations--a boat painting here, a captain's wheel there
The small wooden bar and counter up front incorporate a wine rack and dessert display
Neighborhood friends and families spread out with plenty of room to spare
The Food The best surprises on the El Salvadorean menu are the appetizers
Pupusas, filled with pork, beans, chicken or cheese, are sumptuous pancakes bursting with the flavor of fresh corn
The simple corn tamale comes with a mild homemade sour cream, and the inexpensive enchiladas, prepared with expertly spiced strips of beef, could easily serve as an entree
Main dishes, such as the sirloin steak, are less robust, but the enormous mixed seafood grill, including stellar shrimp, salmon, calamari and mussels, stands out
Finish with a lovely flan
Yes the papusas ARE delicious, so were the fried plantains
So many appetizer choices, I can't wait to go back! The grilled fish was moist flavorful; my partner's steak was really good
Try the Honduran beer -- light, hoppy, perfect for summer
Just remember you're on El Salvadoran time now -- no one's moving very fast
Bahia, featuring the cuisine of El Salvadore, has fresh, well prepared food that is easy on the budget
Great if you like Mexican food, but want to try something a bit different
The papusas are a must try, especially with their freshly prepared cole slaw that tastes nothing like the mayonnaise-ridden American stuff
They have an extensive menu of fresh fish that is consistently well-prepared
Be adventurous and try a fish you've never heard of before
You will be pleased
The decor in the dinin room is a bit bland, but the service is always friendly

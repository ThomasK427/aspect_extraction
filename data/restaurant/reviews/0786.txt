The huge selection of earth-friendly wines rocked, and the bar was a great spot for a pre-dinner drink
with fun East Village people-watching to boot
As for the food, it just seems to get better and better
The artichoke farinata (a kind of crepe meets a pizza) was a great appetizer, while the risotto style cauliflower with morel mushrooms was downright delicious
My dining partner finished every bite of his handkerchief pasta with spring veggies and tarragon pesto (trust me, it's as delicious as it sounds!) We couldn't decide between the strawberry shortcake and the fruit cobbler, so we got both
Again
yum!  If you're a raw foodist, check this out: they have a special raw food prix fixe menu on Tuesday nights with wine pairings
Counter is a great date spot to soak up some East Village ambiance while keeping your karma clean
Nice atmosphere, very cool bar area
Unfortunately, a few of the menu items were sold out even though our reservations were for 7:30pm on a Saturday
The caramelized onion/mushroom/ricotta pizza app was delicious but the shepherd's pie entree was a glorified, layered salad
Very disappointing
The frozen sake mojito was very tasty but a bit too minty even for a mojito
Overall the meal was decent but our waitress ruined our whole dining experience
The food was taking a VERY long time so we kept ordering drinks which you would think the restaurant would want but the waitress was quite rude about it
I think she heard us commenting about her rudeness which made her even more unbearable
Then to add insult to injury, they temporarily ran out of the frozen sake mojitos too! Thank goodness the food came out when it did
I have yet to find a restaurant like Counter
VEGAN food, (not your typical, either) organic wine bar that is stunning, enjoyable atmosphere, soothing lighting, clean bathrooms (very important for me) and service that is knowledgable, attentive, yet unobtrusive
Especially for the E
Village, it's something NYC has needed for a long time
Keep it up!!!!!
This is a wonderful restaurant that should be explored
It is a must for anyone interested in vegetarian cuisine and for those who are willing to explore this style of cooking
Decor was trendy in the minamalist fashion
Service was friendly
I ordered the Cosmopolitan burger
When it came out, someone forgot to put the soy patty in there
That was quickly remedied, PLUS they added some extra fries and a free sangria
My burger was delish, my sis's portabella mushroom dish was much more expensive but no better than my burg
Cuz ordered the asian salad, which seemed refreshing
I recommend this place for the burgers and sandwiches; they seemed to be of the best value, which I am very concerned with as i am a cheapskate
Good with water-refills
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday
The service was exceptional
Casual and chatty, but knowlegeable and informative
The atmosphere is stylish and easy
The food was terrific from beginning to end
Vegetarian food has come so far in the last few years
Highly recommended
Po Boy sandwich was excellent and ginger crepes were delicious
The drinks were mediocre though
Sangria was not very tasty and citrus iced tea tasted medicinal
Wine tastings are fun but nothing on the out of ordinary whites list impressed me
Our waiter was excellent, but bus boy kept bringing us food from another table
Atmosphere is pleasant
Overall it was a good experience and definitely worth a try
Counter is a surprising vegetarian place
The clean, modern feel takes meatless dining to a new level of sophistication - away from the crunchy granola places that abound
A wonderful choice for fresh, inventive eating
Wine list is plentiful, organic and delicious
I've been twice already
Only drawback is that they seem nervous about the slow start
Just be patient
The word will spread
how can the food here be so good? i mean, everything my friends and i had was delicious, not at ALL what i expect when i go (get dragged to) a veggie restaurant
the dishes are sophisticated, full of flavor and fresh
what the HELL?!   i recommend the blue plate special, the beet salad (beets are marinated in citrus, the arugula is garden fresh and the vinaigrette is bright and light) and the roasted veg napoleon--love those roasted garlic cloves!
This place is great! The wine selection alone is worth coming in for
The food is some of the best vegetarian cuisine that I have had in the city
I came here with some friends for a birthday party--we had a blast! What a fun place!
A friend told me about this place
I took a date there recently
There's a wine bar in the front
Tney have a great selection of wines from around the world; most of them from organic or sustainable wineries
Good prices -- most are in the $20 and $30 per bottle range
They have a large selection of wines by the glass also and on weekday evenings they have a great wine tasting deal
Then there's the food
Everything I've tried is great
The owners are friendly and the service is great
Check it out
You'll like it
The ambiance of this place feels confused, skirting the line between ironic diner and wholistic veggie eatery
Service was VERY hard sell, pushing bottled water, multiple appitizers and dessert like an overeager car salesman
Food was hit or miss
The tofu po'boy was delicious
BBQ burger was tiny and missing any sides
Fries were nicely seasoned but they used skimpy shoestring potatoes
All in all, a mixed bag
Go to Angelica's Kitchen or Veg City Diner instead
We (2 ppl) came with no reservations and were seated promptly; there's seating upstairs downstairs
The menu offered a nice variety
I couldn't decide which entree to get luckily for me, the restaurant allowed combos -- I had the minced chicken lamb skewers my boyfriend ate the chicken lamb kebabs
The minced skewers were really flavorful, the kebabs were juicy tasty
We finished the meal with the baklava kazandibi (a light milk pudding served chilled) -- both very yummy! The waitstaff were very attentive
All in all, a delectable experience! I look forward to dining at Toros again soon
more a take-out than eat-in place, sido has some of the freshest and best middle eastern food on the UWS
the babaghanouj and hummus are especially good and the chicken kebab is done just right
Usually their food is pretty decent
One day I decided to order the shwarama platter
Instead of telling me there was nothing left, they sent over a bunch of lamb scraps, the dish was 95%fat, there was almost no meat
I don't know if they were being lazy or mean, but because of this horrendous dish, I will never order or recommend them to anyone
My wife and I had a wonderful meal at Native, which really welcomed us to the neighborhood
Dinner's brightest moment was, surprisingly, Native's mac + cheese, which I believe was made with cheddar and Danish blue cheeses
Good LORD was this stuff wonderful
I can taste it as I write this
*lip-smacking-noises*
The food was good, not great, the service was horrible but the price was unbeatable for a group of 25 people
The waiters were not very professional and could not get our orders right
It took forever to get our food and they simply seemed overwhelmed by the large party

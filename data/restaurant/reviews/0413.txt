I guess the apple does not fall far from the tree
I am simply amazed that this restaurant is still in business
We had the most terrible experience there
In addition
when we left, the owner obnoxiously said I guess this restaurant isn't for you type of people instead of trying to rectify the situation
The true answer is that this restaurant isn't for people
Don't even think about going
TERRIBLE!!
Took a good friend for a late night dinner
@ 10 p
m
- the restaurant was mostly empty
Waiter came and took order
Did not offer drinks or bread
After 20 minutes were able to order a bottle of wine and asked for water - 20 minutes later the water appeared
When the steak arrived -35 min later the potatoes were freezing cold!! We wanted to bring this to the waiters attention- but she was too busy gossiping w/ the host/ess - terrible service - not once came to see if all ok!! Good Grief Mary!! Work your tip!!!
I make it a point to go to 44 X at least 3 times a month
I't sabsolutley my favorite restaurant
Sure, sometimes the service is slow, but name a good restaurant in New York that doesn't have the same problem?? I would defintely recommend the Mac and Cheese and the Warm Maine Lobster Crab Cakes
Ooohh!! Don't forget about weekend brunch! The cranberry and walnut mini-muffins are delicious! Highly recommended
after reading the reviews, i was apprehensive about our experience, but the waiter was so attentive, asking if we had a show, hurrying our order to ensure it was timely
the salads showed up quickly, but after they were removed we waited 30 minutes(!) for our entree without a waiter in sight
abysmal
i have to say the salads were wonderful (expecially the fennel with truffle vinaigrette) and the mac and cheese was to die for, honestly though, not worth it
After waiting almost 20 minutes for a 1:30 reservation this past Sunday, my party and I gave up and began to walk out the door (not causing a scene, simply minding our own business)
We were then followed out by an extremely cocky host (different from who I had previously spoken to) who approached us asking why we were leaving and to please shut the door, its cold
I explained that we grew tired of waiting and that we already had a reservation
He responded, quite arrogantly, that we had only waited five minutes, to which I responded that it was well longer and that my reservation was for 1:30 (it was now at least 1:50pm)
He very rudely said, well, this is New York
Skip this place, the food would have to be exceptional to deal with attitude like that!
is what my party and I found at this restuarant, from the host being EXTREMELY rude to the waitress that ignored us to the numerous male waiters too busy checking each other out to notice that we needed menus, etc
The food was basic brunch fare and okay, we had to ask for refills of coffee and bread, as our waiter was busy chatting at the bar with the bartender
Upon finishing our meal that same waitress that ignored us, suddenly appeared at our table asking if we needed our check, we were finishing our coffee and drinks, yet she was blatantly trying to get us out so that the table could be turned over
I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again
We dined here last night and were sorely disappointed
True, the service is excellent -- really friendly and the decor is stylish especially for this part of town
But the food is close to awful -- especially at these prices
The chef should try simpler dishes, since he/she obviously cannot handle the ambitious menu they currently serve
None of the flavors melded with each other, the scallops and chicken were overcooked while the vegetable were practically raw (and not in a good sense)
The worst offense was the risotto special
I'm not even sure they used the correct rice because the dish tasted more like fried rice than any risotto I've ever eaten
At $20 - $30 an entree you can find better value for your money in many other places around town -- even Hell's Kitchen
Very good food, nicely presented
I followed the recommendations of other posters here and ordered the scallop appetizer and the filet mignon
Both were excellent
And the fallen chocolate souflee desert was unbelievable
absolutely perfect
Reminded me that it's worth paying top dollar for very carefully prepared, high quality cooking
I went to 44 X with a friend and we had great time and meal
The servers were all attractive, men and women
I admit I was sketched out by the surrounding area, but once inside that all leaves
The menu made it hard for me to decide what to get
I got the ancho chili pork with cheese grits
That was the most amazing meal
ever! I was still craving more the next morning
I got dessert too which was good but I couldn't stop thinking about the pork dish
I am definitely going again and ordering 2 dishes, one for there and one for when I get home!
I routinely bring weekend guests to this stylish spot
I absolutely LOVE the scallop appetizer, and the filet mignon is first rate for a main dish
I go to 44 X about once a month, and I have always been served with a smile
Their cocktails are consistently excellent
The only bad thing is the view--there's a big ugly gas station across the street
Great Food, Great Service and really attractive waiters, Especially Eddie :)
Terrible food and VERY rude waitress
The drinks were good but overpriced
No thanks!
A couple of friends and I ate dinner there on a weeknight
We loved the decor, even the bathrooms had ambience with candles and beautiful flowers
The waiting staff was so friendly, and food was imaginitive and included comfort food
The short ribs were yummy, and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly and delicious
We also ate the goat cheese ravioli appetizer, and that was delicious too
So good that I am having my next party there
It's tough to classify its menus into any specific nationality or genre so I'll just say, it is great
The Filet Mignon was one of the best I have has in years and it followed a unique and tasty lobster taco
The atmosphere and intimacy make 44X an extremely pleasurable experience
After my 6th visit to this restaurant last Saturday, I must say, it is one of my new favorites
The food is fresh and creative
The staff is very friendly and attentive
The desserts
decadent! It's a great place to eat outdoors in the nice weather, especially for their wonderful Sunday Brunch
Do yourself a favor and try this place, but call ahead, it is getting more popular and a reservation is helpful!
a good place for a casual dinner with friends
this has become one of my favorite spots to hang out at the bar and drink martinis, not only because the atmosphere is energetic and lively, but also becasue the staff are so friendly
it's casual and yet trendy, with a nice, open space and a techno-soundtrack that encourages a lot of conversation and interaction
the food isn't spectacular, but I have yet to be disappointed in anything I've been served, and there's a definite attempt by the kitchen to keep the menu fresh and interesting
A shining gem in Hell's Kitchen close to the theaters
A beautifully designed space, fabulous food, attentive staff, outdoor dining, and the best part
away from the crowds!! It's worth walking the extra block to 10th Ave
where it's not over-crowded touristy for somethign al little different
You can peacfully enjoy your company and delectable meal in a more relaxed atmosphere striking setting
You read these ratings and this place sounds like hell, but it's not so bad
I thought the servers were great; very friendly and attentive
The food (I had the special which was some delicious monkfish) was superb
The environs were also quite attractive, with a lot of light and nice high ceilings
Give it a try!
Dining here is like dining in a restaurant out of NYC that is trying to be SOooo, NYC
I thought I was in Jersey but then I looked at the prices
I'll go to Chelsea for my dinner with attitude and spend less money
Having just moved into the neighborhood, with fairly low expectations for the food, I was very happily surprised
I had an excellent special of horseradish crusted halibut

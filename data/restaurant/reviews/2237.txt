I even left with an autographed copy of the cookbook!
Since it is located near the heart of Broadway, and because of its late 80s-like vibe, I avoided Le Bernadin all these years, assuming that it's overpriced and hyped
Thank God my husband dragged me there because the food was SO FINE
Their prix fixe is one of the best deals in town, I'd say, if you like refined French cuisine
Chef Eric Ripert really deserves all the medals, I think
The restaurant is beautiful but not opulent in an imposing sort of way, the decor is actually quite modern and the combination of the teak-wood and the soothing blue tones of the carpeting and walls is very pleasing to the eye
The service is impeccable but not the least bit snooty
And finally the food - outstanding
It was clearly all about QUALITY and not quantity
Each dish was absolutely perfect
Dishes were sauced individually at table-side
We had the 4 course menu and you certainly did not leave feeling stuffed but neither did you feel cheated
There were also many bottles of wine that were affordably priced
For a special occasion, this is the place to go
One note, this is strictly seafood, if you are a landlubber, do not venture here
There are few if any meat options
WOW
I've always had a bad habit of rating restaurants according to their bread baskets and their desserts
I, with an awfully severe sweet tooth can honestly say that this restaurant has the most deLIGHTful desserts I have ever had
Small morsels of heaven that can alter your state of being
I recommend having them spoonfed, slowly
:-)
Food is extremely FRESH! The serving size is acceptable so that you don't go into food coma
The customer service is excellent except that they tend to get too attentive
You gotta go try if you are a seafood lover
Le Bernadin caters to a specific crowd of diners, and I would suggest reading this to make sure that you do not go, and then leave disappointed and hungry despite a minor dent in the credit card
About the portions: if you were to order only one course, then yes, you will probably complain about the small portions and leave hungry
I recommend the prix fixe menu of 4 courses
The food is absolutely delicious and carefully prepared, and I was pleasantly full
The desserts are amazing and a must
The service was impeccible even though the restaurant was very busy
The ambience is beautiful without being overwhelming
Overall, I was very pleased with my experience and would go back for another special occassion
LB is the best of NYC's top tier, but you must order the tastings to reap full value
ordering piecemeal is for tourists and one-offs, so it's bad value
But those folks aren't the restaurant's true focus
The real effort is in the tastings, which bump your tab but not beyond the extra value reaped
If you are used to gorging yourself you won't get full here, but regular eaters will be quite content from the tastings
Eating is not about feeling full
My advice is not to go here if you don't truly appreciate fine food, or if your favorite restaurants are steakhouses and pasta joints
you'll feel ripped off, but if food is your thing and paying for a near-unparalled taste experience is within your means, book early and don't bother with anything but the tastings
Avoid weekends perhaps, but service will almost always be great, rare aberration notwithstanding
what is french about this restaurant besides using french cooking methods? i did not expect so much asian influences in so many dishes in this so called french seafood restaurant
at least 4 of the items in the 7course chef's tasting menu uses flavors from the east, including the dessert!
this is not to say the food wasn't good but the mini me porportions sized food was a bit too harsh for the wallet
well it is a TASTING AFTER ALL
however the dessert porportions somehow ballooned to regular conventional sizes
is this a strategic move to somehow quickly fill you up before you leave technique?
But there wasn't enough to taste
Portions are microscopic and wickedly expensive
My half ounce of grouper was served with 2 shoestrings of broccoli rabe, I also had a teaspoon of brandade as an appetizer
Fill up on bread - as much as you can
You'll leave hungry
If you're thinking of coming here for a special occasion, go to your favorite restaurant instead
If you saw LeBernardin on Colamecco's show, note that the portions shown were twice life size - seriously
Food was great
We went for our anniversary
My husband had called and requested for a nice table months in advance
But when we arrived we were seated next to the kitchen
We were later changed to a table further away from the kitchen, and the service thereafter was great
But what a turn off to be seated so poorly in the beginning for such a special occasion
We both got the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairing and cocktails and would have gone back otherwise, but it left a bad taste with the poor inital impression
I'm not just trying to be different, that attitude is for the insecure, but I must say I don't get it with this place
I have the money to go here often, if I wanted
But, I just hate the feeling of being ripped off
Portions are tiny (as they are in many overpriced restaurants), and taste ok, but the main course is an appetizer
The appetizers are good for mice, perhaps
Rich mice
Nice place
But I don't get it
If you are into good food that is overpriced, this is great
But if you are into value, go elsewhere
I guess I just feel that owners of places like this must be laughing hysterically all the way to the bank
This is a damn good restaurant, probably the best seafood restaurant in New York (excluding super-high-end sushi places)
But I enjoyed it better before I dined in Paris
Went recently for the chef tasting menu with wines, the wines chosen were quite good (even a Hirtbzerger Guner Veltiner, a nice red burgundy and a good 2000 German, among other things)
The food was very very good, but not spectacular, the way a three-star Michelin guide restaurant would knock you over
The service is outstanding! Though I have always liked the paintings
This restaurant is one of the best I've ever been to
Wonderful food, outstanding service and incredible atmosphere
This place is wonderful for a special occasion
A true fine dining experience
The service is wonderful and the dishes are prepared each with its own identity
Great wine list
romantic and sparks were flying after dinner!!
A truly amazing experience for fish lovers
This restaurant is just out of this world when it comes to seafood
Every dish is unique and sublime
The tune tartar is amazing, if you are a tartar lover, you'll never be the same! Service is impeccable, they will treat you royalty
Dining room feels open and luxurious
A magical meal worth every penny
If you are not a fish aficionado - you might find 4 star restaurants Jean Georges or Gramercy Tavern more to your taste
I just recently went to Le Bernardin with my boyfriend for his birthday and it was a great experience
I recommend it for a special occasion
Everything from the salmon dip at the bar (while waiting for our table) to the dessert was perfect
The scallop appetizer was especially good
The crowd was a little stuffy though
Le Bernardin is still the best seafood restaurant in the world
We had an extremely enjoyable meal with great service
I just had dinner for the first time at Le Bernadin and it was truly amazing

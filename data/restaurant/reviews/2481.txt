That always fills me my guests up
The place is small it's hard to find parking, but it is definately worth the time wait
You won't regret it
This is a definite must try place especially the sangria
The mini pitcher serves 3 and large 6
Food is excellent and portions are big
The only down side of this place is that the restaurant doesn't take reservations but you can always order a sangria at the bar while you wait
I just happened to stumble upon this place
But it's great
They gave huge portions and the price is just right
It's not just Chinese it's also Spanish food leaning towards Peruvian flavor
There's a theater right around the corner so its convenient for dinner and a movie
FdM is one of the best values in the city
For outside of Chinatown, they have very good Cantonese food
Best value is still their half-chicken with fried rice and shredded lettuce for $8
50
On Saturday nights, they offer an excellent lamb stew special
Lines could get long since they don't take reservations so I would suggest going early, i

Usually, it's not so bad at that time
This isn't traditional Peruvian-Chinese food, but they do have great food here, but the prices are what's great
The decor leaves much to be desired and although there are a lot of waiters, since this place is always packed, you might have to wait for that glass of water you requested twice
I can't speak enough on the food, haven't had something I didn't like yet! The prices are so great that you can order a bunch of things and not have a ridiculous bill
This is one of our favorite restaurants on the upper west side
The food has consistantly been good and the servers are very attentive
The interior is a bit tight at times, mainly because it is so popular and filled with lively customers
There's a nice relaxed vibe and the prices are right
The drinks are good, too
From the first time I ever stepped into a Flor de Mayo, I fell in love with the restaurant
the food is delicious
the service is great, the waiters are always there to help, the food is inexpensive
the drinks are good
the peruvian menu there is also amazing
I highly recommend the chicken, it has the peruvian recipe, that's why flor de mayo is so famous for
If you are peruvian like me then i also recommend the ceviche mixto with chorros a la chalaca
it is high quality, low prices restaurant
I love Flor de Mayo! Hands down the best chicken in town, not to mention warm bread and friendly staff to greet you
The only decision for me is whether to get broiled pork chops or the half chicken
The place is affordable and the food is allright, the chicken is dry though, there are better places in the city for roasted chicken
Although I must say the broiled porkchops here are pretty good
This place is the best of the best
I mean it
The 1/2 chicken with special fried rice (that's what they call it) is totally to die for
I crave for this place all the time! The prices are great, the pina coladas are really good too
They recently renovated and it looks like a place in SOHO for half the price
The waiters are a little slow with service but it's worth the time and money to go here!
This restaurant is really great and it's kid-friendly too! The staff was so nice and accomodating
The food is TERRIFIC! The roast chicken tasted exactly like the chicken I had when I visited Peru! Very authentic! The best part is it's so cheap!! Definitely give this place a try
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he LOVED it! I'm Chinese and he's Hispanic, so this Spanish Chinese restaurant was perfect for us
The setting is so romantic
The food is awesome and definitely affordable
I visited this restaturant with my husband, sister and her husband the summer of 2000 and it was very affordable, the food was very tasty
The restaurant has a lenghty menu, the portions were big and the service was good!!
In Short Patrons grab one of the eight beers on tap at the bar, and then slide into a roomy booth or a table in the atrium
The menu, which features steaks, burgers and pasta in addition to sushi, is robust
Starters include potato skins, slathered in cheese and bacon bits and a warm goat cheese salad
Salads and pasta are listed under "Big Bowls"; sushi is half-price on Mondays and Tuesdays
I highly recommend this
The service was awesome and the food was really good
The whole staff was very friendly and we were in and out very quickly
Awesome!
I love this place
It has a fun atmosphere and great food
The resturant offers early dinner deals in addition to daily specials
They have half price sushi on Monday Tuesday and 5 dollars off wine Wednesday Sunday
I'm a eleven year old child and I love The Hi-Life Bar and Grill!  Their specials, food variety, waiters and waitresses, good prices, outside seating and huge plasma screen Tv's make The Hi-Life Bar and Grill the place it is
Their food consists of good American style food, mexican food, fish, meat and sushi
They have a half price sushi night on Monday
Hi- Life Bar and Grill's hamburgers and crisp thin french french fries are the best in town
If you're looking for a good simple meal try the rosemary chicken
Hi- Life Bar and Grill's enchiladas hit the spot!  The waiters and waitresses are extremely helpful
Having a drink at The Hi-Life bar and Grill will make you completely relaxed
This restaurant a is the perfect oriented family place for you and your children
Expect a great meal and time at The Hi-Life Bar and Grill!
Hi Life is the coziest place on UWS and one of the very few good bars to hang out at in the neighborhood
Love the food, love the drinks and with the out door seating open, I even had a great Easter Sunday brunch
Will be there a lot this summer
I love this place
You can go a lot and get something different each time
Get the mussels
they are a yummy good deal
Great sushi and awesome prices on Monday / Tuesday (1/2 off sushi)
Service was great and beer /sake was reasonable
Will definitely be there again
Probably next week
Definitely the best place for burgers and drinks on a warm weekend night
There's great seating outside, and on the side by the large open doors
Excellent burgers!
As Christmas approaches my stops at Hi-Life seem to increase in frequency
Their simply isn't a cozier joint in all of NYC
Yes, I do quite alot of drinking there, but I use the always excellent food to entice my friends to join me
I'm waiting now for huge snow storm to trap me at Hi-Life right thru Christmas
Looked like a scene from Scarface meets Mod
First floor area is classy but stupid pond in basement and try too hard beds on second floor were sad
Nice drinks though and friendly crowd and staff
I'm not a fussy eater and I have never walked out of a restaurant before
But I walked out of hi-life because the food was plain inedible
We also had to wait 40 minutes for our food to come out

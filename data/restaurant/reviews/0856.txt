The server even sent out after dinner drinks for my grandmother's birthday Each time I've returned I've felt the same sense of hospitality from each waiter or waitress I've had
It's always great to find a restaurant where the food and service are consistently great but even better when the price is reasonable
i went with my bf and it was really nice and cute and romantic
we ended up having a great conversation over some nice wine
I love this place
My boyfriend and I had our first date here nearly a year ago and now it's our favorite place
The service is awesome, the atmosphere is very warm and cozy
I love it! We even go there for lunch when we are just hanging out in the Village
A great place and a great staff
The food is great, love this lil' spot!
What a great place! My wife I went for an early seating on a Saturday as we were heading uptown for a show and essentially had the place to ourselves
I don't understand how this place is not full all the time
Service was excellent; the food was as good as any I've had in NY recently
The stuffed lemon sole was great as was the red snapper with shrimp
The shrimp crostini appetizer was also excellent
Topping off the night with the fondue was over the top but extremely tasty
This is a great place - more people should try it!
My girlfriend and I had dined at Andavi on 10/19/05 and loved it
The surprising thing was that there was practically nobody there
We had reservations but there was absolutely no need
Yes, it was on a Wednesday, but we were shocked on how empty the restaurant was
Our food was excellent as was the service and wine
though I was surprised they only serve wine and beer
The atmosphere was very romantic
I highly recommend Andavi
I hope more people learn of it
If you're looking for an Italian Restaurant that can accommodate large groups in the West Village, your selection is pretty slim
I recently had my 30th birthday dinner there and I can't complain about a thing
The prices were fair, the food was wonderful, the atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable, and the service was spectacular
The staff was very knowledgeable about both the food and wine selections
We sat in the back garden, which had heaters so outdoor dining is an option all year long
The experience was great
I'll definitely visit Andavi again no matter if it's to grab a glass of wine at the bar or dine with a friend (or many friends)
Had dinner with some friends last night and was really impressed
The food was amazing, the service was great and the vibe of the place was so cool
Our waitress really knew her stuff and was able to reccomend a great bottle of wine
definitely check it out, its worth the $$ and for dessert get the fondue, it's to die for!
This place came highly recommended by a friend and Citisearch, etc
but at the end of my meal I was left unimpressed
The service was very aloof, and both my companian and I had a bad entree
I had the crispy duck with rose petals as a side
Neither of us ate three bites before we stoppped but no one even asked us how our meal was
It took about twenty minutes to get our waitress's attention after she finished reading the want ads for another job
I get the romantic appeal that there was good lighting and they put rose petals everywhere
But overall, I'd say skip it for a meal
Last night I took some friends out for dinner to Andavi
We all left very happy
A wonderful girl named Merideth took excellent care of us
She was very knowlegeable about the wine list and menu
I ended up going through two bottles of Jordan Chardonnay (in my few years of drinking wine, the best chardonnay I've ever had)
We ate in the garden area, very pleasant
We started with the rice balls with marinara and this portabella mushroom appetizer (they have added some items to their menu, not on their website) Oh my god, best portabella mushroom I've ever eaten
Tasted just like steak
We all ordered fish for dinner (different types) Everyone was happy
i wanted to have dessert so bad, but the rest of my party was too stuffed
After reading all the wonderful reviews about this restaurant my fiance and I felt this may be the place for us to have our engagement party
With this being said we made an appointment with the manager to come in and discuss details
Once we arrived we were met by the most wonderful of people
Annette the general manager was an absolute delight as well as Rob and the rest of the wait staff
They all were very accomodating, informative, pleasant and friendly
While taking in all that the restaurant pleasantly had to offer we eagerly had dinner
All we can say is DELICIOUS! Every meal was better than the last
From start to finish this restaurant was amazing, we highly recommend it for whether it's a simple get together with friends or for just a nice cozy romantic evening
You won't be disappointed!!!
Andavi is a hidden jewel in the West Village
The flickering candles and decorative red tones make for a very romantic and intimate atmosphere
The food is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! The hazelnut-encrusted salmon is to die for and the macaroni and cheese balls will keep you coming back for more
The service was excellent and the staff genuinely nice
I've always had a good experience at Andavi and will continue to come back
Definitely a 5 star restaurant
Our meals were outstanding
The ambiance was very inviting
They have an outstanding selection of full-bodied red wine
Our waiter was a real pro; knew a lot about ingredients and allowed us to take our time
Ended up as a prefect pick, I was not sure if it would be the best for me and a friend since all of the reviews say ROMANTIC
but we went anyway
WAS WONDERFUL! We ended up splitting some of the aps which I would recomend
didnt taste the entrees, but the aps were the best I have ever had
The wine the helped pick was great and ended up ordering a second bottle because the first was so good
Only bad thing is that it was raining so we didnt get to try the outdoor garden
Save that for next time!
If you are not concerned about the food and only want a romantic place, it may be the place to go
I went with my boyfriend and had one of the worst experiences foodwise
Although this place was romantic and the ambience was nice, the food was not light
I ordered penne vodka and I did not even feel like finishing it
For an 18 dollar pasta dish I would expect much more proficiency and quality than this
I would not go to this restaurant again and would not recommend it
I took my parents here for an anniversary celebration and we had a wonderful time
We got a lot of personal attention, the staff kept coming over to make sure the evening was special
The food was great, the ambaince was intimate, and the staff was very nice and friendly
Highly recommend this place
Great service overpriced mediocre menu
I don't understand how it's called Italian
Call me a jaded, spoiled New Yorker
but, I was totally over NY Italian restaurants
been there, done that
Untill I went to Andavi on Saturday evening
The space itself was stunning; beautifully decorated, great music, loved the candles
The food was superb
The lobster ravioli was incredible- finished with the perfect amount of white truffle oil

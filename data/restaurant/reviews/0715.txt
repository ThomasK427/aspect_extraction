I enjoyed the dishes, cool ambiance and drinks
The uneven service (really attentive when you can get it, though) seemed mostly to be attributable to spotty communication/coordination between servers/busboys and wait staff, but not grossly bad
Decorated like a suburban contractor's idea of tenement cute, and with a staff and kitchen seemingly on their maiden voyage, I would call my experience disappointing
I have been here 3 times in the last 3 weeks and have grown to love this place
It is cozy and the food is unique and reasonably priced
Go for the calamari salad as an appitizer and check out the fireplace room
Waitstaff is nice but not very professional
There's no question that the staff of Tenement cares about what they do
Despite the fact that they seemed totally disorganized with regard to seating (we had to wait 25 minutes past our reservation time), they try very hard to make up for it with amazing food and attentive, thoughtful service
The room is gorgeous, and a little sultry
A DJ plays ambient party music
The front portion of the room is an intimate space perfect for a couple, while the private alcoves in the rear accomodate groups in style
Tenement's menu is great, i have tried most of the items and evreything is great
The back room is beautifully decorated, and very romantic
It's a great place to start the evening for a date
great meal, romantic settings, then grab a drink in one of the hip, trendy bars in the neighborhood
*Try the Spinach Salad in a warm bacon vinigrette!!!
It's usually the other way around but I went the other night and the food was horrible
I had the pork chop and it was barely cooked
My wife had the salmon and said it was fine
But the worst was the bread - the waitress came out with a basket and looked like we were going to get some warm rolls - they turned out to be at least day old
When a meal starts with bad bread, you know you're in for a long night
But service was fantastic, for what that's worth
Tenement is a very comfy place with some very comfy food
The potato pancake appetizer was more then enough for 2 people
The main courses were excellent
And the price's were a really pleasant surprise
It started off with being forgotten/ignored by the maitre d' for about half an hour but after we reminded him we finally got a table
We then quickly ordered our meal since we were hungry
After half an hour, we asked for bread-they had run out! It was at that point that the table next to us told us the service wasn't very good
Then, after waiting 45 minutes for our appetizer, we decided to leave
But as we were putting our coats on, our waitress showed with our main course
The food was the only saving grace; it was very good
However, we ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert and it was frozen solid
Overall the food was pretty good but the service was terrible
We had no expectations of this place other than enjoying a scotch by the fireplace in the back (perfect for a date)
Turns out the food is really good
We had the potato pancakes, pear-gorgonzola salad and pork chop
All the portions were surprisingly lrg esp for a hip-trendy place like this and the food very creative
Best of all the prices are supper reasonable
I had a great experience there
I would definitely recommend it before the word really gets out
(and If you have any questions about Scotch, ask Rick! very nice guy and knowledgeable!)
I can't believe ppl could complain about dining at Tenement
let alone at any nyc rest
It's not like were living in europe
and get treated with disdain from grumpy under payed servers
I am a neighbor and have ate here on several occcasions
Never have I been unhappy with the service or the food
THe waitstaff is always on target and fun to chat with
All I have to say is STAY on the upper east side
and don't bother bringing your attitude downtown
Wait staff and woman at the front definitely aren't making an effort to hide their distain for their jobs and the customers
This is the attitude you would expect from an upper east side place
Great DJ when I have been there
Recently, an annoying host who lies to try and coerce you to take a table, but otherwise, great atmosphere, great lighting, good snacks
I had a great meal here this week
I recomend the pork chop any day, service was good and the check was very reasonable
Definetly will be returning
Tenement is elegant, cool and sexy
Wine is served in a long stem glassenhancing the taste and experience; appetizers were just right, scallops tender, softspring rolls crispy
Sitting in a quaint back room lit by a fire place with friends, good food and great wine made our evening at Tenement, perfect
Had a great time with old friends and made many new ones
The appetizers were extremely tasty, especially the stuffed tomatoes and the grilled sea scallops
Spent saturday night here, good music and nice crowd
Bartenders where friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced
Will definetly return
Either these guys were having a bad night, or they need to seriously rethink their strategy! I ate here on the opening night and 'nightmare' is the only adequate word to describe it
Lower East Side trendy, it may be, but that's the only thing going in its favour
From the obnoxious clipboard girl on the door, to the shambolic staff inside, the whole night sucked
We had to wait an hour before our food was served, then another hour inbetween courses, all the while whilst the staff were naughtily hiding in an attempt to avoid our 'where's out food?' pleas
My partner and I ordered salmon, which I can only describe as tasting like how I would imagine a car tyre would taste
In addition, our male server looked (how can I put this delicately?) 'UNCLEAN'
All in all, a thorough disappointment and not an experience I will be repeating
Was there during the first night of a set dinner menu
Though the kitchen definitely needs to iron out some kinks in prep time, the food was pretty and well prepared when finally served by the lovely Geena
Homey, and well priced
Not aching to go back
the biggest draw is that it's a uniquely neighborhood restaurant on a street most noted for it's dives and style-spots
The Scene Atari T-shirts and retro Pumas abound in the bar--and, yes, those are Space Invaders in the tile floor
The back dining room, with brown wallpaper and half-moon booths lining the wall, has truck-stop diner written all over it
The Food The menu is a mix of country French and trashy Americana
Aside from excellent star-shaped biscuits, smooth venison pate and a big bowl of beer-steamed mussels, culinary successes are few and far between
Saucisson and frissee salad with lardon are satisfying, while chicken fried steak is gloppy and the pork chop, overcooked and tough
Even pretty cupcakes taste a day past their prime
Budget beer is the drink of choice--the cans of Tecate even come with a salt rim and a lime wedge
But if getting a buzz on is the goal, a pint of Big Red, the house specialty, will get you there a lot quicker
amazing wines and at great prices
wonderful food and fun friendly atomosphere!! LOVE IT
Starfoods has gotten so good lately
the prices went up a smidgen but the quality is much higher
they still have their famous biscuits and charcuterie and the best value in wines I've seen in NYC
A must go for an lower east sider
1st of all, the menu has changed since many users have rated it
my friend and i went expecting free biscuits and cookies, and good mac n cheese
turns out theres a new chef now, and none of these things are available any longer
anyway, the menu is limited and boring, and the service is horrendous
my waitress was unable to answer my questions about the menu, and forgot to put in my order
of course she realizes this only after serving my friend
by the time i get my order my friend wouldve finished her meal

wont go back because of drinks and coffee issue
not good customer service!!!
With my girlfriend going to a club on the block, we just walked in unknowing of this place, to sit at the bar and get apps and a drink to kill time
It was a nice place, romantic I could see
We got a seat at the bar around 10pm saturday night no problem
Got 2 apps that were delicious and the bartender made some strong drinks, he could have at least smiled said my girl, but his service was great with our orders
Small tv's to watch the game, interesting decor, low lighting
If you're going with a date to a lounge on that street, stop there for a drink and a quick appetizer first
I want on a date to Justin's this past winter
The inside of the restaurant was set up okay, though it was a bit too dark and the bathroom was even darker
The young man we had as a waiter was very friendly, professional and knowledgeable, which is a plus compared to some restaurants
I ordered the fried catfish, which had very little to no seasoning, the yams, and mac and cheese which were just okay
I did like the teriyaki wings that my date and I had for an appetizer, they were very good! My date enjoyed his food, he had some type of jambalaya dish
What I found funny about this restaurant is that P-Diddy still kept the restaurant a little ghetto by having them use plastic bags that you would get at your corner chinese restaurant for take out bag
Justin's restaurant was just okay to me
I thought the food was excellent
The chicken was to die for and the yams and cornbread were yummy! I love it! We had a very nice waitress as well
The atmosphere was warm, sexy, and very romantic but the lighting wasn't good for reading the menu
We wanted to order the pork chops (which were the special of the night) but they were all out
I had the roasted chicken and it was great
The salad was very good the only problem was the cheese it should have been fresh
The Cesar dressing was on point
The music was the most refreshing
The selection of music was urban (just the way I like it)
The service was good as well
I recommend Justin's if youre looking for a different style of romantic dining
If you want to receive impeccable service and delectable food, Justin's is the place to dine
The staff treated me as if I were a celebrity, which I am not and they did not make me feel uncomfortable as a single diner
The staff was knowledgeable about the cuisine and answered my dining questions with professionalism and style
The menu contained a huge variety of caribbean and southern cuisine for the choosy diner, such as me, and the food was divine and memorable
The atmosphere was embracing and enticing and the costs of the meal, $45 to $55 in value
Had dinner there with 5 other girlfriends
Whatever everyone ordered was Amazingly good! I had the Beef ribs with steamed vegs and Plantains (fried bananas) and it was mouth watering
The prices are between $25-$30
But the portions are huge
You can't share a plate though
1 entree min per guest
They played hip-hop music while we ate
The place was not crowded for dinner on a Sunday night at 8:30pm
I was in New York celebrating my birthday for weekend
We wanted a good southern breakfast and decided on Justin's
We arrived, were greeeted and sked by the hostess I think if we were there for the Brunch, that was starting up again on today(3/12) the cost $25 per person
We stayed for limited breakfast selections, out of aluminum tins, plastic cups of soda and fruit punch, no coffee, tea, mimosa orange juice etc
The staff fixed their plates at the same time
This is the most interesting experience I've ever had at a restaurant
I would really like for P-DIDDY to explain to me how he allows his son's name to be put on such a trashy place? The hall that leads to the restroom looks like an alley way, and the bathrooms look as if they are under construction
The inside of the restaurant looks as if it is the inside of a smoker's home and they've throne all types of sheets and mitch match curtains up to hide the holes and unpainted walls
The food took an hour to come out and had a nerve to be cold
I am dissapointed and shocked
I wonder how often he visits his own restaurant? I can't believe he would allow such trife
It is named after his prince
right? The place should live up to the name-ROYALTY,ESQUISITE,FINE
I thought it was great, best service I've ever had in a long time
The food was just excellent
Everytihing on the menu looked delicious
I would definately recommend this restaurant to couples if you desire a romantic atmosphere
My cousin and I went to Justin's after work last evening for dinner because it was my birthday and I have always wanted to eat there
I must admitt I was skeptical because of the reviews I had reed prior to my visiting
However, I was impressed with the elegent atmosphere
The music,lighting, service, and food was all exceptional
I will add Justin's to my list of to do' while i'm in the city
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
I went to Justin's for their Industry Tuesday and I must have gone on an off night
I must say the food was good and the service was excellent but everything else was horrible
The bar was not fully stocked, the manager claims the shipment did not come in
They were out of Hennessy, Alize, Mojitos, Pinot Grigio and the list goes on and on with at least 20 other liquors that they did not have, not to mention the drink list is very limited and does not include a wide selection of interesting drinks
Then there was the D
J
who played music from the 70's 80's etc
that's o
k
but when you play Prince and Bobby Brown's whole album that's a problem
By 10:30 there were only 30 people in the entire place and at least 15 were staff and security
Overall I was very disappointed with the night
I cannot believe this place
first of all, the hostess was not pleasant and had a bit of an attitude when seating us
It took an hour an a half for my friends and I to get our food
We were not even hungry after waiting so long! To top that off, the manager was so rude when we spoke to him about our experience
I have not had such a bad experience at a restaurant in such a long time
i ruined our night! I will NEVER come back here and certainly not recommend this place
Justin's is an awful restaurant
even worse than the food is the ridiculous noise in the place
It's too loud and the cheesiest music is played throughout the meal
In my opinion it is an embarrassment to P Diddy and he should cut his losses and close it and move on to what he knows best, like records! Avoid this trap
I can truly say that this was the worst experience that I've had at a restaurant
I had gotten mixed reviews, so I wanted to see for myself
I got the Mardi Gras chicken w/ the rice and beans
This was just plopped onto my plate; no presentation whatsoever and the rice was hard
My sister got lamb chops and they didn't even ask her how she would like it done
It was indeed the worst thing I have ever tasted
Total cost of a horrible night - $97
Are you kiddin' me?
I ate at Justin's earlier this year while in town for the Grammy's and I was very plesantly surprised
The food was absolutely delicious!!!! The atmosphere was incredible - it gave a very warm and inviting feeling - and the music that played was excellent
The staff was VERY friendly and welcoming
My friend and I were able to have a really interesting and cool conversation with our waitor, who we found out went to college minutes away from where I went to college
Small world! Anyway, as I said, the food was delicious and the drinks were great
I even saw a few celebrity atheletes come in! The only negative things I can say about Justin's is that it is somewhat pricey and the restaurant seems to be off the beaten path, especially at night
Overall, I would definitely suggest going to this restaurant!!!!
The food was absolutely great and the atmosphere was fantastic

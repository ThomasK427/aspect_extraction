Great if you're around mid-town/Chelsea
I work on 50th and they deliver to our building all the time
The wings are the BEST I've been able to find in Manhattan
Great selection as well - Wings, Salads, burgers,etc
It's a good atmospher in the restaurant as well verse the average run of the mill place in that area
I also agree with the previous guy about the daily soups - my personal favorite is the crab chowder - but as they say - to each his own
These wings the best in nyc HANDS DOWN, as many times i've driven in to nyc from jersey - through the tunnel - just becase i had an Atomic Wings craving
Now that I live in NYC - Every sunday - for Giants games we call these guys and their deliveries are pretty punctual as well
Also, the grilled Chicken salads - mesculun, caesar are great too, if you want something other than poultry
These are by far the best wings in all of NYC
Personally, I like the abusive, but if you like your wings really hot, try the suicidal
They also have amazing burgers and sandwiches
My delivery came in about 10 minutes and everything was perfect, I was even able to have a pint of Ben Jerry's brought with my wings
So if you're looking for some REAL buffalo wings in New York, you've got to try these
I don't see why a previous reviewer hated the wings so much - they are pretty good and the shoeshring onion rings are great
I've been going to Atomic Wings for lunch every week or so for a couple of years and I've always enjoyed it - gotta love the Niagara Falls wall!
I got their chicken, i think it was rotisserie with a few sides and my sister, boyfriend and I agree that it was pretty decent chicken
It's asmall place
I dont think there is an eat-in area but it was pretty clean and the staff nice
Good value
It's an excellent alternative to Spoonbread where its more expensive or KFC, where it's just fastfood
Yum! For someone who used to hate Indian food, Baluchi's has changed my mid
While most would agree that the food here is very Americanized and not too authentic - for me this is a GOOD thing
Finally a curry that I can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later
Try the homemade breads
All are GREAT - poori, naan, paratha all FRESH
Also the Ka-Choori appetizer (vegetarian goodness) and the Chicken Makhni (Indian for Butter Chicken, American for FATTENING AS HECK) is delish
Initially, I liked the food here
But of late there is no consistency in taste
I once asked for malai kofta to go, and the kofta was not done well
The next time I asked them to take care and do the kofta well, and the manager insisted that I try something else because he could not guarantee the taste!!! And he forgot to send samosas with my to go and charged me extra for it!! I have NEVER gone there after that, no matter how close it is to my place
The service is bad too
Do yourself a favot and avoid this place

Asif the manager is also a great guy and the service has always been very friendly and accomodating
I was lucky enough to stumble across Bistro Ten 18 when visiting my son at Columbia
It is a friendly neighborhood restaurant with wonderful food and excellent service
It has become my favorite NYC restaurant
Meals are fresh, delicious and interesting
Service is attentive and gracious
I look forward to visiting my son and the Bistro over the next three years
As an upper west sider, it's nice to be close to a restaurant as good and as pleasant as Bistro Ten 18
I've been there a couple of times and highly recommend the chicken
For dessert, the brownie sundae is about as good as it gets
I'll keep going back and hope that more good restaurants follow its lead and populate the upper west side
This restaurant looked so cute and they even gave out a complimentary tasting of wine, but the ambiance came to a quick end as I discovered numerous bones in the fish
Even the mussel appetizer was marginal and overcooked
Well at least the bread basket was nice
I was recently part of a 12-person party for sunday brunch and they had us waiting OVER AN HOUR for our food
We didn't leave because we didn't want to make a scene
Perhaps he was annoyed that we inconvenienced him when the reservation was changed well in advance
There was another large party but we were treated as 2nd-class citizens
We had to ask for bread after 45 minutes and even though our waiter was GREAT, he had to ask the stiff manager to comp us a round of drinks for waiting so long
The un-customer-friendly manager comped us NOTHING for waiting for room temperature food, so we stopped ordering drinks
He only kept giving us the evil eye as to intimidate us
With this type of customer service, I'm surprised the place is still in business
It's ONLY advantage is the location of which there's nothing else around
I just moved to the neighborhood and thankfully have found my brunch spot as well as my weeknight hangout
The bar is perfect for single diners - the staff is friendly and talkative, but they also sense when you want to be left alone to read or study
I've been there 4 times already this month- the service was a little slow one day for brunch, but that's okay because the bloody marys were excellent and so was the food when I got it
As for dinner, my favorite is the steak frites or the crabcake
I will definitely be bringing friends here to try!
More than an hour an a half wait for our delivery and still no news
All the manager could offer was to yell and then hang up the phone
Pretty ridiculous to treat your customers like that, especially with so many great alternatives around
I've lived around this area for the longest time and have eaten at all the restaurants in the neighborhood and I have to say, that bistro ten 18 is a real gem
I went there for lunch on a quiet weekday afternoon and everything my friend and I ordered was immaculately presented and absolutely delicious-- I had moules frites and she had the salmon burger
We both commented at the end of the meal that everything was just impeccable
My coffe was good, my fries were perfectly done, my mussels were not overcooked and the waitress was extremely attentive
A really special place
Without contrivance, it has a feel of a noirish cafe, where you might see Humphrey Bogart at a corner table
Soft music plays in the background
The food was absolutely perfect and the bartender a delightful talent who made the best martinis we have had in the city
Service was top-notch! We will definitely go back!
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect
Great wine list and great cocktail menu
We ate at the bar and had so much fun with our gorgeous bartender
We'll definitly be back again!
It may be a little out of the way, but go see the Cathedral of St John the Divine and stop for dinner on Tuesday for Jazz night at this cozy Bistro! The scallops were wonderful and so were the lamb chops
The wine list has something for everyone
The service was friendly
A great addition to this neighborhood!
I highly recommend this restaurant
Good first date place to take someone to get to new
The food is very good and the service is great
One of the best things about the place is all you can drink wine when dining in
I either eat in the restaurant or take out
Service is very friendly and prompt
Facilities are very clean and food is impeccable
All I can is that my whole family has known this place for over 10 years!! We first started coming here when it used to be called Broadway Cottage on 103rd and Bdwy
Always fresh always tasty and the people ALWAYS greet you with a smile
Best sushi value I've come across
Grade A sushi,,, excellent for takeout
Hole in the wall location but excellent food

service is average
theres really nothing to recommend about this restaurant, but its ok it youre looking for a lunch spot near grand central
The food was cooked to perfection
The service was wonderful, and very personable
I was impressed with the amount of attention they gave us
I ordered a seafood pasta dish that was absolutely divine
I highly recommend this place
Was at Gente a little while back
Have only kind words to say about the place
It was a calm place with some of the great desserts around
Try the orange sorbet
Take friends there
It's a terrific place for groups to talk and eat a tasty meal
A group of freinds and I went to Gente and really enjoyed it
The service was good, the food was excellent, and the ambience was very nice
Its well suited for a romantic date, I think, but was also good fun with a group of friends
I highly recommend it if you like authentic Italian cuisine!
I was pleasantly surprised to find such authentic Italian fare outside of Little Italy
As a vegetarian, there were many different options to choose from although I would personally recommend the eggplant parm
Great place for a date or with a group of friends!
Went to Gente for dinner not too long ago
The decor was nice and comfortable
However, the food was decent but not worth talking about
My main problem with this place was the unprofessional service - a table of young women got the attention of the entire waitstaff while the rest of the restaurant was very painfully ignored
GENTE Ristorante Italiano is an incredible Discover
11 Wines by the glass a varied Assortment of beers and fabulous cocktails (like green apple martinis)
The food is very authentic (I have been to Italy many times with my family
) one o our group was born in Italy and he said the lasagna was almost as good as his mothers  								ROSA
I recommend Gente to anyone looking for great pasta without breaking the bank
The staff is friendly and accomodating, and the desserts are very impressive
All in all, a great Italian experience
Gente was the PERFECT place for our holiday office party
Jay (owner) is so easy to work with, completely flexible, and along with his staff can accomodate any of your needs
The intimate space is perfect for a private party because it enables you to have the whole restaurant to yourself
The food is great and the prices so reasonable
I can't imagine a better choice for a party!
My friends and I take our moms out to dinner ever year for Christmas
This year we picked a Gente out of city search and just hoped for the best
It turned out to be our best outing ever
The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the prices were cheap! The restaurant is cozy and great for group dinning!   I absolutely love this restaurant and will come back again and again!!!!
Gente is a rare find among NY restaurants
My wife and I had dinner there last week with two friends, simply because it was convenient to one of our workplaces
What a surprise! The food was among the best Italian any of us had ever had, with many unusual dishes
Be sure to try the Lugurian pasta and DO NOT MISS the Carciofi Judea, the absolute best version of this dish we have ever had
The prices were remarkably moderate, especially considering the quality of the food
Jay, the owner, is a born host and proudly recommended various dishes to us
My husband and I were in New York for the weekend and we found this restaurant on citysearch
Being from Italy, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the food was very authentic
The appetizers were so good that we had 3 different ones followed by some nice home made pasta
The biscotti with the coffee were superb and the service was very good well
I recently had a baby shower at this restaurant, and i can't tell you how many compliments i received regarding how quaint and casual the place was, the great food, and the great service
It was the perfect place to host a small group of 30 people or so
Jay and his crew are very accomodating
I would indeed host my next gathering there again
Good food, very good service and not that expensive
not to mention it's not crowded so you can actually have a conversation
I have never ordered a bad item from this great little restaurant
The service is always great, and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy
All I can say is they are fantastic
I recently hosted a bridal shower at Paper Moon Milano Express
They did a great job setting up the room and serving great food and drinks
I let Jay pick the menu and he did an awesome job
The pasta was something I've never had before and it was outstanding! He also served great champagne with raspberries which was a big hit
The Scene Little about this modest-looking Mediterranean restaurant gives it away as a place for such original and refined food
The atmosphere is brasserie-like; once a bank, the dark, echoey interior features an open tile floor, bright orange walls, linenless wood tables and red leather banquettes
The restaurant's Theater District location assures an older crowd
The Food There is striking flavor in the deceivingly simple preparations
A note-perfect chicken dish, for example, plays up a beautiful series of accompaniments like chopped cashews, beets and a sweetened cashew puree
Seafood is also a strength, particularly in a richly herbed lasagna of crab meat, mussels and shrimp and in a punchy bouillabaisse
Stick around for the chocolate and peanut butter tart with celery sorbet, a sort of grown-up take on a Kit Kat
Honestly, I don't know why people consider French food, gourmet food
I hardly found anything to eat in Paris except crepes on the street corner
Yes, they make amazing bread, but man does not live on bread alone
I was skeptical about trying Marseille, but they had a Restaurant Week lunch menu and it was close to my sister's office
This is what I wish I had in Paris
The food was fresh, flavorful
I loved their presentation and creativeness with different mix of ingredients
Their dessert was traditional but amazing!!! I loved the sorbets, and they're just fruit! Definitely living up to the hype
I have been coming to Marseille on and off since they opened a few years ago
It has always been a great place, but now it truly feels excepetional
The menu, the food and the service all seem to have a confidence about them
The wine list is exceptional, with many resonably priced selections
Servers are always warm and eager to please
I have enjoyed many of the entrees, but especially the bouillabaisse
Keep up the great work!
After reading a lot of positive reviews, I expected some good french food
The atmosphere was good, the service good, but the food, only average
Our appetizers were bland, the shrimp beignet misleadingly named
The duck magret was good, but the veal tasted like an italian dish rather than a french dish, and that was disappointing
The wine selection is good
Overall, this restaurant was OK, but nothing exceptional
A chrome top bar with an attractive blonde oriental bartender pouring cocktails
A heavily French accented maitre'd seats you at your table
The menu is short, but mouth watering
The portions are small, but taste as good as they sound
The lamb, duck and fluke entrees were of particular note
The wine list (by the glass or bottle) offered just enough variety to satisfy everyone's taste
This place has truely become part of the New York theatre district experience
The waiter was very rude and arrogant
We thought maybe it was an isolated event, but he also was rude to each of the couples to either side of us

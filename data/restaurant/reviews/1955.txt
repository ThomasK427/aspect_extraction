The staff was very thorough from everything to bringing water to clean-up and was evident that all work well together
Our waiter was very helpful in selecting a fine wine to providing recommendations on selections offered
The appetizer selected was the Chrysler - an absolute must have!! The Food was exquisite
Everything from NY Strip to Tuna Steaks to Dover Sole - and fresh as can be
Make sure to leave room for dessert as the Creme Brulee and Chocolate Souffl is to die for
I was immediately impressed by the grandness of the dining room at City Hall
However, we were made to wait 20 minutes for our table, even though we had a reservation and the restaurant was not full
Food was mostly delicious, including shrimp bisque, handcut french fries and rib eye steak
The chicken was dry and bland
Meat was not cooked correctly and needed to be sent back
The wine list, while long and of decent quality, is confusing
Service is polite, but disorganized
We were waited on by three different people, and none of them knew what the others were doing
Red velvet cake was boring and dry--this was the first time in a while that I left dessert unfinished
Coffee was undrinkable and left nearly untouched
Despite snags, the main server never apologized once, nor were we offered any compensation, which is poor for an expensive, upscale establishment
Making reservations for Valentine's Day, I was not informed that it was a fixed menu, nor was it posted online
Didn't have a choice for the regular menu and was basically stuck with an overpriced dinner
Ended up paying nearly $200 for an average meal
The lady who handles the coats: attitude problem!
Trying to be something that its not
Cheesy decor
Mediocre food
There are plenty of other places that aren't quite as pricy and have much better cuisine
Service was intermittent (was it b/c we ordered from the Rest Week menu?)
Food was decent, a tad above mediocre
Medium steaks were rare (cold on the inside)
The dessert was pre-made and our waiter was annoyed that I asked for no whipped cream
The bill arrived without us having to ask - oh, in fact, when we were being served our dessert
The doggie bag (I couldn't finish my raw meat) was left with the coatcheck because the waiter informed us that they don't like the food smell in the restaurant area
Aren't we in a restaurant? Is it perfectly acceptable then for your coats and hats to smell of food? PASS ON THIS PLACE NEXT TIME
I went to this restaurant after wanting to try it for such a long time
I was very disapointed it was horrible
I went with three other friends they all had terrible dinners
The steak was greasy, the fish was gross, and the chicken dumplings looked like cat food
It was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had
If you are thinking about going here don't it is not worth the over priced cuisine
these folks couldn't even handle taking a reservation
don't waste your time
Extremely rude and worse yet, marginal food
The restaurant has potential
the pre dinner drink at the bar was very pleasant, good start, although we waited up to about an hour before our table was ready
The restaurant wasn't busy
The food was good although we waited a while for our order to be taken then waited even longer between courses
The only thing that arrived promptly was the check
Tribeca is bursting with restuarants so I suggest going elsewhere
Too much butter and pepper in everything, too much of an old boys club atmosphere
Waitstaff is very friendly and efficient but you get the impression management is less then stellar
This place is soo over rated
I went to try this place during restaurant week
The food they served during the week was so bad, and stingy
I don't understand why restaurants participate in the restaurant week if they are not going market their food, not even close
They suck compare to TGI Friday
Desert tastes worse than hospital cafeteria's
I was so disappointed
There are a few restaurants that you return to again and again for a favorite dish - City Hall has many
From the curried onion rings and Delmonico steak to the raw bar selections, our cravings keep us coming back
The staff is pleasant and professional, and the wine list is extensive
We're excited to try breakfast - the menu is a treat, and a meal on the patio would be a great way to start the day
I walk by City Hall almost every day and I was very excited to try it last Friday night for my boyfriend's birthday dinner
We had a 7:30 reservation and we had to ask the maitre'd twice in one hour of waiting at the bar if our table would be ready soon
The atmosphere is beautiful and normally we don't mind sitting at a nice bar for some time before dinner, but this was ridiculous
They didn't even bother to approach us and apologize for the long delay
We ended up leaving and walking to Tribeca Grill where we were seated in 20 minutes without a reservation
If you can eat on the terrasse, do so : this place is really noisy ! Great steacks, french fries, onion rings and mashed potatoes
Nice decoration with lots of wood
After a week in Paris (where service is LACKING), my fiancee and I decided to go here to spend the last of our remaining vacation money
We were not disappointed
The food was fantastic (a brussel sprout side that was amazing), and the portions were generous
the Delmonico steak is worth every penny! The service was great on a Saturday night; the sommelier was helpful and the servants were attentive to whatever we wanted
Though the cost may scare some away (meal for two with shared appetizer and desert, drinks, 1/2 bottle of wine and coffee totalled about $150) it's a great place to dine for a special occasion
The atmosphere at City Hall was very nice, as was the food itself
Everything was going well until the main course arrived when, as happens at so many Manhattan restaurants, we ceased to exist
There were a bunch of larger corporate-type groups so maybe it was assumed they were bigger tippers or something
We will go back - but will demand the attention we deserve
After going to a cocktail party/dinner in the Granite Room (downstairs) at City Hall Restaurant for a very delicious work function I decided to bring the family there for dinner
I have 3 noisy children and a pretty festive family group
All were satisfied
Our waitress brought the kids a placemate they could color on and choose their meals off of
I thought that was great
She also had the children's meals brought out with our appetizers
Again
a great call
I didn't even have to think I just was able to put my evening in her hands
The food was incredible
Delicious steak and all the sides are served in the center of the table for all to enjoy
The kid's meals were all priced and portioned according to age
The chef even came over to say hi
I love City Hall Restaurants
I have been frequenting City Hall for a few years now, mostly for lunches with clients
The venue is lovely
The food is better than average
I would have always described the service as hit or miss, but lately the service seems to be always miss
I just cancelled a reservation simply because the reservationist was a b*#%ch on the phone
I am done spending my company's good money on a restaurants that treats its patrons so poorly
For the price, I expected top notch quality
The food wasn't bad but I've had much better at a even much better price
I am a big time steak connoisseur so if you are going for the steak, I would suggest you go somewhere else
Oysters were good(but not hard to mess up) and service was good too
The watery creamed spinach was the only thing that was definitely a send back

I cannot wait to go back
And everything was so cheap!
Filled with smoke and crowded
often a wait
burgers are pretty tasty but small and not that exceptional
You're better off going elsewhere and saving the headache
If you are seeking a great burger, Silver Spurs and Paul's are better
it's easy to find a great burger in New York, but not easy to find good value
you can pay $5 or $50
corner bistro is great value, but not the best value
for that go to molly's
The burgers are awesome! Totally worth the 45 minute wait on line
Not so bad, you wait on a long line but you can grab a couple beers at the bar while you wait, and they have McSorley's on tap for $2
Go with friends and its a great place to hang out and get some good all-american cheap eats
any downtown ny'er has to try this place at least once
go during off hours (before 5pm or after 1am weeknights) to get seated quickly
my burgers have been inconsistent as to temperature (i've ordered medium and they have come out rare occaisionally) but i eat them anyway because it is always delicious
the fries are top notch, too, and it is great that they bring them out first
The burgers were juicy but greasy
Never go there to buy takeout
While you're standing around for a good half hour waiting for two plain burgers, you're being bumped into by people waiting to be seated because of the narrow passageway leading to the dining area
They totally ignored us so after about 25 minutes, we gave up and decided to leave
The hispanic guy who makes the food was nice enough to run out and give us our order so we paid him and went on our way
The guy who took the order and who was also seating people, ran out after us screaming You never paid! Pay or give me food back! Luckily the other guy saw and cleared it up
Let's just say, we'll never go back to this place again
The burgers were average and weren't that great to begin with anyway
basic burger, tasty and a catchy atmosphere
Daddy-o's nearby is MUCH MUCH better and unknown
The wait is certainly worth it
For a quick bite or a latenight snack CB is great
Cheap cooked perfectly to order burgers and cheap beers too! You are missing out if you like burgers and haven't been here yet!
What they say is true, this is the best (regularly priced) burger in Manhattan

Melon is a close second, along with Paul's Palace on 2nd ave
The atmosphere is awesome too
It's a smoky, beer- and bloody mary-guzzling wooden bar with surly bartenders
just the place to have a great burger experience
If you are looking for a hole in the wall hamburger joint, with bad fries, burnt buns, and slow service this is the place for you
Sure, the prices are good, but you are only getting good, not great
Definitely not the best hamburger place in NYC
Pound for pound, one of the best restaurants in the city (if you're in the right mood)
Just be ready to wait in line for awhile
Don't get me wrong, this place serves up some tasty burgers and chicked sandwiches but I'm not sure if it's THE BEST in NYC
The prices are certainly tasty though
If you like great burgers and beer in a no frills environment, and don't want to pay NYC prices, this is the place for you
Don't expect linens on your table, or lemon slices in your water, just expect a great burger at a great price and you won't be disappointed!!
Last Friday 12/27/2002, found the excitement of going to CB overwhelming
Saw the buns toasting and the meat under the broiler
The burgers were served, but what? The meat was lacking in flavor
And, worse medium rare turned out to be unevenly cooked? Bottom line, not worth the hype or the wait
The hamburger was so greasy, I had trouble keeping it from slipping out of my hands
And then when I was finally able to take a bite,I had to wipe my hands 6t imes on the napkin in order to get the grease off my hands
I could not tell whether the mayonaise I ordered was Hellman's or Kraft's, it was so raunchy tasting that I had to conclude that whatever jar it came from, the expiration on that jarwas over due
The soggyfries keeled over when I dippedtheminthemayonaise
The waiterwas a pleasant, Dave Thomas look-alike, whoforgot to bringme a lemon andthen my mayonaise
But he was so genile, all was forgiven
The joint was packed with smokers and drinkers, on NewyearsDaywhen everyone should be home recuperatingfrom the night before- A cause for concern when it was time to freshen up/but to my surprise there was no line at all
But the bathroom was difficulttofind/inpoorcondition/andunclean
Corner Bistro was the most amazing burger we had ever tasted in this world
Seriously, it was delicious
From the charming host/bartender Paul to the local neighbor in the corner, Roger, the atmosphere and the delicious food filled every part of our hearts as well as stomach
Do not look for a menu as you don't need to order anything else other than a burger, fries and beer
We will definetly see you there:)
The sweltering rack of burgers at the bistro is a fine, fine site
Plenty of meat is placed on each of those irrelevent objects called buns, and to wash it down with a 3$ brew is just a joke
It's certainly a good time at minimal cost
This is teh place for very high quality cholesterol
Itnakes heart disease worth it
Why are they considered best burger? It's NOT flame-broiled, it's done on one of those frying-pan machines, and tastes like I did it myself in my kitchen
If you want a REAL flame-broiled burger, hit Florent in the meatpacking district
The burger I had was a tough, overcooked, tasteless overhyped disappointment
I've eaten better burgers at Wendys
First of all, the meat was lukewarm, as if it had been lying around for a while before being served
Secondaly, the bacon on the burger was the consistency of jerky
The cheese wasn't even melted
I cannot believe how anyone could think this is the best burger in the city
Beer was good, so the night wasn't a total wash, but don't be fooled by these other people who say that their burger is the best in New York, because it simply isn't
Don't believe the hype
If you really want a good burger, fly to SoCal and go to an In-N-Out Burger
Corner Bistro is the place to go when you want to unwind and enjoy yourself
it was a 45 minute wait for less than average burgers the worst chili EVER in a noisy, dirty tavern
the burgers were requested as medium and well-done
instead we got well-done and rock-hard
the quality of the meat is not even worth mentioning
the chili was mainly oil, which was, quite literally, the entire top half of the bowl
the food is undoubtedly inexpensive, but it is not even worth it
we went out of our way to try such a highly-rated place and ran out in disgust
The best burgers
Awesome value
Great ambiance
Great place for a weekend lunch
This really is the best burger in NYC
I always get my burgers medium-rare
In lesser burger joints, they are cooked and brown all the way through
Not so at the Corner Bistro; Their burgers are charred on the outside and still bloody on the inside
The buns are also very good: hearty and dry, not soggy and dampy
Read that twice if you like Paul's Palace
The Corner Bistro is also superior to the Jackson Hole and Cozy Soup and Burger
I pity those who only had these inferior burgers, and I challenge them to the visit the Corner Bistro and discover what a good bloody burger is

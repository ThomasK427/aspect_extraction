Excellent service (great waiter) ---even though the hostess mixed up our group reservation but the manager was kind enough to fix that promptly---unexpected for a busy Friday night
Oysters are fresh and jumbo ones are a very good size
Seafood dishes are ample to very generous in portions (cod dish is great, specialty dishes recommended, bouillbaise was very good too, grilled fish anything all good)
Space was good for the crowd---not too spacious but not too crowded (nice intimate setting for couples and small groups of people)
Excellent downtown location---walking distance of other bars, shops, near trains, buses and parking space
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ALL
Although pricey, it's definitely worth the money overall if you're looking for quality seafood in a nice intimate/cozy setting
i have been to aqua grill on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed
the wait staff is top-notch, knowledgable and accomodating
the aqua bites (like a cosmopolitan but better) are a refreshing starter cocktail
the wine list is one of the most affordable and better wine lists i've seen around town
the raw bar is superb, as are the perfectly seared and incredibly sweet diver scallops served over a bed of crab meat risotto (not to be missed!)
the desserts are on the refreshing side, nothing too heavy but nonetheless delish! AQUA GRILL GETS MY VOTE HANDS DOWN FOR THE BEST SEAFOOD RESTAURANT IN NYC! cheers to the chef and his staff for always dishing up delicious food in a completely unpretentious atmosphere
next time i'm there i'll raise my aqua bite to another decade on spring street!
I always end up going to this place for brunch
I think I have only been to dinner twice at Aqua Grill but whatever time of day I go, I am never disappointed
The wait staff is very friendly and service is great
The lobster sandwich is great too
unlike many of the reviewers, we had fantastic service but the food was very much hit or miss!! crab cakes--so-so, they were served on a mesclun salad with a really bland and uninspired vinagarette
i ordered the salmon blt--sandwich was really good but the fries they were served with were way too salty
and i'll eat almost any french fry!!! dessert was delicious but overall too spotty to go back!!!
Aquagrill hold a special place in my heart as being my first restaurant experience in NYC
Whimsy aside, it stands out as being consistently excellent; busy yet comfortable, innovative yet homely
A glass of champagne at the bar sets the scene, and the food is delicious
The tuna tartare starter stood out, as did the cod main course
The wine list is surprisingly reasonable and the service is friendly
The tables are a little too close together, but when the food is this good it's difficult to be distracted
After hearing the rave reviews, we had to go and see for ourselves if this place could live up to the hype
We went for a quick lunch and both the crabcake sandwich and the lobster roll were fabulous
Great food, attentive service, terrific decor and prime location have combined to ensure I return again and again!
Consistently good - one of the few places where I'll eat oysters raw w/o fear
The selection is incredible
My friends love the fish
The noise level can get loud but the service is wonderful
absolutely delicious seafood
the fish and scallops are always perfectly done, really moist and cooked just through, great oysters, and lots of interesting off-beat seafood, such as sea anemone and others
It's a great place to go if you're in the mood for standard seafood (grilled tuna) to the extremely unusual
Also, great selection of what's in season
Had amazing stone crab claws
Good drinks too, the aquabite and cocktails are really well made
Also, nice atmopshere without the heavy formality of uptown seafood eateries such as Le Bernadin and Oceania
Good stuff!
I typically only order mild fish so I had the Sole for lunch it was fantastic
My guests tasted it too
The Lobster roll was a favorite at our table
Of course you should go for the oyster selection
A small restaurant but a great find! Now one of my favorites!
I've eaten here several times, and as a seafood snob, I can say I've never had fresher fish on the east coast
The service isn't always great (especially for larger groups) but it's never been rude, either
The oyster selection is perhaps the best in the city, and they usually have one or two very unusual fish selections as well, which are always worth trying
I strongly recommend the restaurant
One of the few places in the city that has fresh herring from Holland few the few weeks in early summer
Wonderful food and service whether at a table with a group or at the bar when eating alone
Great oysters, service was nice, food was fresh, ambiance - decor nice too
You can't go wrong with the selection of oysters here
great wine list and the right atmosphere
Food is good for price
Enjoy a drink at the bar over fresh shucked oysters
I love aquagrill during the summer
I get my hair cut right across the street and as soon as I'm done I always sit at the bar at Aquagrill slurping down some super-fresh oysters
It's a bit pricey, sure
but it really makes for a good experience
Somehow, the ratings for my review, Sour Grapes, posted on 05/16/2002 and erroneously credited to Anonymous are missing from the site
Here they are now
In addition, the chef, Jeremy Marshall, will prepare his fresh fish any way you want - they will happily prepare for your dietary restrictions

In a couple of visits, I've found the food to be first rate, especially considering the price
The fish is fresh, with emphasis on unusual options, like white salmon
The preparations are creative, although they prepare most fish simply, too, if you'd prefer
They had outstanding raw bar selections, too
There's no comparison to Blue Water
The food here is far superior, although it's nowhere near as big a scene
If youre going for great seafood, you cant get any better than Aquagrill in SOHO area
Prompt seating (less than 15 minutes without reservation) and very friendly service
My only problem is our waiter makes a mistake in our order (computer error) , but I can live with it
THe food was terrific, except for some overdone Tuna
The ambiance was terrific and everyone was very nice until we sat down at our table
Our waiter never poured a glass of wine, took the bottle of wine away before we were finished, took plates away before we were finished and then gave me a bad look when he got a tip that he deserved
There are to many reteraunts with food of that quality to say that I will be sorry to not go back
My husband (a hard-core seafood lover) and I (not a big fan of seafood) dined at AquaGrill last Saturday night on their terrace
I often find seafood dishes either bland or greasy --not at AquaGrill
I had the tuna w/jasmine rice cakes in peanut sauce that was mouthwateringly delicious
My husband had the cod w/ mushroom sauce that was amazing! Our French waitress was the sweetest and most knowledgeable server I have ever encountered
Delightful! The manager (in pigtails w/ribbons) was also very helpful and charming but not overly solicitous
She suggested a creme brule w/armangnac prunes, I know it sounds odd but it's very sophisticated
Sophisticated it was and incredible! My husband has dragged me to Le Bernadin (bland w/snooty service) and Duck's (Red Lobster?) and Blue Water Grill (loud) but now I'LL be the one suggesting we go out for seafood --only at Aquagrill!
Why does it take so long to be helped? Doesn't it matter that you are paying? Apparently, not - was what I got without any apologies
Food, of course, is always great but at a price of rude service
It just isn't worth it
If the manager apologized that would help somewhat but no apologies - whatever!
Rocky's is a charming Italian restaurant in the very trendy Nolita neighborhood
Although the restaurant is small, it is very comfortable and it's size allows for personal attention
The food is classic Italian and just delicious
This place is perfect for dates and/or getting together with a small group of friends
Highly recommended
The Scene The sidewalk tables which wrap around this see-and-be-seen Soho corner fill quickly during warm weather
Those less interested in people-watching dine inside the whimsical, wood-trimmed room under a canopy of Italian inscriptions, or at the long, art-lined bar, which hosts a hopping after-work crowd
Service is casual and competent
The Food The owners successfully recreate the big, bold flavors and simple, seasonal preparations of their native Tuscany
Start with a roasted pear and truffled pecorino salad, or spice-dusted tuna carpaccio draped over baby greens

I decided to do takeout and had 2 orders of summer rolls
4 in all
They were average size
Food was prepared very fast
As for the taste of the roll I have had better
It was good and satisfied my craving but nothing amazing
Total was $7
00 which was somewhat reasonable
Restaurant was very busy when I arrived
I was at this restaurant actually a few months back, but since I am back in the city, I will definitely go to this place again! I was there with a couple of friends and upon getting a seat, the waiter immediately went about creating a dinner for us
Great service, great food!
Amazingly good food that is just like my grandmother's cooking! Try the pho, fried eggrolls and barbecue red snapper
Only disappointment is that the rice is not served in a bowl
This is as authentic as it gets!!!!! Bon appetite!
It ain't pretty, but Nha Trang (the original) serves the best authentic Vietnamese food in NYC
The Scene It's true that most of Joe's customers here aren't from Chinatown, and that Joe's menu offers some mall-friendly, not-so-Chinese creations, such as sesame chicken
Still, customers line up here for a reason: Joe's cuisine is consistently top-notch and otherwise authentic Shanghainese
Prices compare to the bigger restaurants in Chinatown, and the wall of critics' praises grows larger every year
The Food It's difficult to find anything that isn't outstanding
Drool over the succulent pork shoulder, braised tender and sweet in a smoky, malted sauce (perfect over rice), and melt-in-your-mouth fresh bacon, sliced invitingly over vegetables
Crispy chicken pieces on the bone, marinated in soy sauce and garlic, is like fried chicken gone to flavor heaven
Joe's famous fried flat noodles taste homemade, with perfect body and springiness
Finish with sweet red bean pancakes, oozing with fragrant, delectable red bean paste
Me and my boyfriend were visiting from SF and I was excited to go there for the buns
However the ones we had that day had skins that were way too thick and the filling was pretty tasteless
We also ordered the braised pork shoulders, the eel, and the double-side fried noodles and they were all below average
I was quite disappointed and actually remember the food being better the last time I came to NY
We had soup dumplings, but the best was the chinese eggplant in garlic sauce and the clams in black bean sauce
Incredible
Those three things and rice and a soda was only $30 without tip!
but that's ok, cuz the food is amazing
This is my favorite chinese place in NYC
Best General Tso chicken in the city
I was impressed with the Dumplings and fast service
The Sesame Chicken dish was cooked to perfection
Some items are more Americanized but I don't mind it at all
The soupy dumplings are so good and authentic
Highly recommend
Staff is indifferent to your business
Curt service
The typical looking, old, dirty, chinatown restaurant but THE DUMPLINGS are the best!!! The seafood pork dumplings are the only reason to go there
The rest of the menu is not stellar
Also, usually you have to share a table with ten people as there are only a few coveted non-communal tables
This branch trumps the 56th St branch handily
The thing about the soup dumplings that makes it spectacular are the delicacy of the skin and amount of soup contained within
Everywhere else, it's always a dried out bundle of dough with little soup or meat
Other Shanghainese must-haves are the Lion's Head, Tofu with Crabmeat Sauce and Eel with Yellow Chives
I'm not thrilled about the Noodles with Spicy Sauce (Jar Jiang Mien) and the Potstickers (Guo Tie) are just okay (I've had better elsewhere)
Service is rather abrupt if you don't speak the language and you get lumped with strangers
Plus sometimes their cleanup of previous diners' detritus isn't as good as I'd like
Best trick is to either dine before 5pm or after 10pm to avoid the crowds as much as possible
But what the heck
You're here for the dumplings, not the promptness, service or ambiance, right?
Don't know what to order?? They are well-known for their soup filled dumplings with crab butter and meat
the crab meat dumplings is a must order
Also another special dish of theirs is the yellow chives baby eels
Even though their wait can be long at sometime, but it is definately worth the wait
Sometime you need to have some patience if you to eat the best
If it is a place that no one goes to, you'll know that the food is not good
I go here only for the soup dumplings, the rest of the food is good
but nothing u cant get anywere else
The times Ive gone the service has been okay, theres always a long wait if you go on the weekend though
The crab meat dumpling is defintely to die for
everything else is just average
you can get the same in a regular chinese restaurant
the service i have to admit is the worst i've ever experienced
not only did it take forever to get the check, they stood right next to you waiting to get the money
i watched as the waiters were staring at the customers while they were counting their money and deciding what amount to leave for a tip
they made it a point to count the money in front of the customer making sure enough tip was left
there were some that was a little short on tip and they made sure customers knew about it
it was a disgrace on how they ran their business
if it wasn't for the dumpling, they would have been out of business a long time
If you're looking for dumplings, this is it! If you can handle having about 2 sq
ft
in which to eat, then you'll love this place! Best on Sunday mornings/afternoons
Joe's has the best soup buns in the tri-state area
There is no place else that even comes close
The pork shoulder is to die for, and goes perfectly with white rice
But, the only reason to wait on line at this place is the soup buns
Can't stop thinking about them, can't stop eating them
No ambience, slow service, blah, blah, blah
You want good food and the BEST soup buns, come to Joe's
It was really crowded, but the food was good
It took some time to get the waiter's attention to get the check
We paid and left over 20% tip in cash on the table
As we left, pushing through the people coming in, THE WAITER CHASED US DOWN TO TELL US THAT THE CHECK DOESN'T INCLUDE TIP
We had to tell him that the tip was on the table in front of at least 5 people
I will never go back to that restaurant again
No one deserves that kind of humiliation
Ever tasted soup douplings well they have them here something to taste delicious I must say
The food was tasty
It light on the stomach
It busy and crowded
The service was great
The only thing I could say is the place is simple looking
It good in the stomach
First of all, let me say that Dew22's review is laughable
He probably pissed off one of the Chinese waiters and asked for Americanized food like chicken strips
This is the place to come for an authentic experience
Get a few orders of Soup Dumplings and try out the Lion's Head dish

This restaurant has it all
Great service, and all that you desire in Italian Cuisine for a reasonable price
The restaurant is medium in size, but can hold a party of 15
*Reservations are required for parties of 4 or more
You will enjoy all that Cara Mia has to offer!  Located on Hillside Avenue near Springfield Blvd - it is accesible from the Clearview Expressway, Cross Island Parkway and a moment away from the Grand Central Parkway
I have been a customer of Sybil's for years
It's the first place we call for authentic Guyanese roti, tennis rolls, currants rolls and the like
I was also surprised on a recent trip to learn that they have a location in Miami, too
Definitely a treat on every trip
The food in PARA TI is great
It is always fresh and tastes great
The seafood is especially great and shouldn't be missed
They serve large portions at low prices
Once you eat there, you'll go back time and time again
This place has not been moved to 58-02, 37 avenue , Woodside, NY 11377
The set up and food and beverages service has been same since it was catering as biggest Filipino Restaurant in tri-state area
If you really want the authentic taste of Filipino Delicacies visit Lourdess
The food in Nino's Pizza is great
The food is always fresh and they use the highest quality ingrediants
Nino's Pizzza has been around for ages, groups of students and children in the neighborhood have grown up eating from here
You get large slices of pizza and food for your money
You can' go wrong eating at this place
I was surprised to find such down-low, neighborhood Jamaican restaurant to be on citysearch!   I have been Genesis' fan for quite some time, and the food is always delicious! I recommend Red Snapper (Brown stewed), and oxtail
(I personally love the fruit punch, too
)  Food can be eaten inside the place, but it's more like a takeout place
Definitely not a place for dates
My husband, who is carribean, loves Garfield's food
I also love his food, and so do all of my friends
Comforting, and authentic! We all live far from the restaurant, but we keep going back
yes, food is that good:) and very consistant
I highly recommend this place!
I have been going to Margherita's pizza for over 20 years
It is out of my way now, but I will still drive to Jamaica Avenue to get a slice or two
People raved about Gaby's and I finally tried it
Gaby's is good, but Margherita's is exceptional and I have to say is the best in the city
The slices are pricey for the neighborhood (and always has been), but the fact that it is always packed attests to the value
I highly recommend it!!!!!
These guys have been putting out the best pizza in New York since my grandmother would take us there in the 70s! BTW, the Italian Ices are awesome too!!!
It's cheesy, great herbs,good bread and large slices But it's in a very dirty area, good for take out and bring it home kind of place
It' s easy to get there just get off the Grand Central
I think that the pizza and the service was the best part of the restaurant
I think Mamu is a great man and he deserves all the respect he can get as possible just because teh respect he gives to his coustmers and as well as to his family members
Special shoutouts to Mintu he is the son of Mamu and he is also a great person so anyways I love kelly's so plz i recommend to anone reading this because it is amazing there!!!
THE FOOD IS REALLY GREAT AND I LOVE TEH RESATURANT
IT IS VERY CLEAN AND THE COUSTUMER SERVICE IS REALLY AMAZING
I REALLY LOVED THIS RESATURANT
I RECOMEEND TO ANYONE THAT IS RADING THIS TO GO TRY KELLY'S PIZZA BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE TRIED IN SO MANY YEARS!!!! KELLY'S YOUR GUYS ARE AMAZING
In all the years I've been lunching or dining at the Flagship, I've never been disappointed
The food is great, the specials are varied and well worth the money and of course, the service is the best
My only suggestion would be to avoid long waits for food by adding extra servers when there are large groups
Tell them Mama Del sent you
The expanded version of the neighborhood Pizzaeria is just great
This is the Pizza my kids grew up on! Great place to get a few slices or eat in their tablecloth backroom where they serve great food for reasonable prices
The menu is a great list of good basics but the specials are always SPECIAL
Can always get something outstanding in this true to Italy standby
Albas is the best pizza
Of all my life living in New York it is the best in Queens
It has great service and very large portions for a good price
As well as a place for tourists, many community kids and adults reunite there and have a great slice of New York Pizza
That's what it is all about
The iffy part may be the fact that Queens Blvd
is right in front of it which makes it a hassle to park
Alba's is what every neighborhood needs
A terrific local place with great food at reasonable prices
Portions are very generous and there are always great daily specials
Service can be a little slow sometimes, but the food more than makes up for any lapses there
One downside is that parking in the area is terrible, but this place is still worth a trip
They started as pizza and some italian fare
They didn't (a few years back)deliver, yet of three exsisting pizza establishments, they were the only one left
Their menu as well as the restaurant has expanded
The best in Queens
The food is wonderful
Real home cooking
Portions enough for 2 meals
Otherwise known as the Fish House it's the best BBQ/Carribean food I've had
Unfortunately this is STRICTLY take out
If they ever open a sit down restaurant I will be one of the more frequent customers
The Candied Yams and Baked Macaroni are so good you may just begin to munch on the container
One dinner could last you for a midnight snack and lunch the next day
RCL also provide catering services and they have been in business for AGES and are well respected in the community it lives in
When you go ask for Miss Mary!
Friendly community pizza place
Does lots of business and delivers locally
Small booths
I have friends in the Rockaway area who for some reason like this place, but I happen to think this is the worst Chinese food I've ever had
There are several other decent places in the area, so you can skip this one
While the service is slow and the waitress can be forgetful, I found the food to be just what I was looking for
The menu is very simple and unimaginative, but if you are going here for foie gras you are in the wrong place
This place makes good old fashion home cookin'

Our meal began well enough with a nice wine, good bread and oil and a good special appetizer
My companion enjoyed a lovely special
I made the mistake of ordering from the menu: a filet mignon with a presentation that sounded wonderful
I ended up only eating the presentation, which was incidentally, not what was described
The meat, however, was wretched
it was not a filet, first of all, it was grissley and tough and unpalatable
No attempts were made by the restaurant to make up for the fact that I had paid 25 dollars for a piece of meat I wouldn't serve in my home, let alone in a restaurant under the guise of being a choice cut of meal that it clearly was not
Williamsburgers are drawn to this place because of the nice outdoor setting, but the food is mediocre at best and the service is downright awful
Unless you fit a certain type, (i
e
wealthy, with money to spend on liquor, apps etc
) plan on spending a long time waiting for an outdoor table
If you're lucky enough to be seated, prepare for clueless, snotty service from ditzy test bunny waitresses and run-of-the-mill quasi Italian-French-something fare
In other words, if this place did not benefit from attractive garden seating in an otherwise dreary neighborhood, it would have closed down long ago
Feh
I have lived in New York for 12 years, and I have rarely experienced so much attitude to which a restaurant was so little entitled
The unfortunate waitress was so profoundly ill-prepared, ill-mannered, and badly trained her only recourse was to pretend sophistication and haughtiness as a substitute for her complete lack of social graces (probably a function of youth more than character)
After expressing some incredulity that a fried fish would take 40 minutes (on top of the 10 we'd waited -- clearly they were backed and were unwilling to be honest with us), the only advice she (and the restaurant) could give was If you don't like it, the chef says you can leave
Suffice it to say, we did
We went to Miss Williamsburg, and despite it being busy, were treated with decency, respect, and lovely food
Go there
Not here
I've tried this place twice
The first time I was told I'd get a table in 5 minutes and after an hour and a half I was still waiting
Last night I went and was seated right away, I ordered fish and my husband ordered chicken cacciatore
ten minutes after we ordered the waitress came to our table and told us we had ordered complicated entrees and we would be waiting for 45 minutes
She didn't ask us if we'd like to order something else, merely suggested we buy appitizers
Ten minutes later she returned to our table and told us if we have a problem with it we could leave
We tried to explain we didn't have a problem but she merely repeated what she said
I will never return
This place had a really neat ambiance; the outdoor dining area was spectacular
The music was even very fitting, Frank Sinatra! The service was alright, a little slow, but if your not ina hurry then it's great
The food was really good, not my favorite italian but it was worth going
The prices were even really reasonable
I love the food, and have gone back several times, but each time the waitress is a little nastier
The garden is lovely, too, but the staff seems a bit condescending
We've had three waitresses, and only one has been pleasant
The other two seemed not to want to serve my party because we're young and look like students, rather than rich wine-drinkers
Once we practically had to beg to be seated outside because the waitress was afraid it might rain (it didn't) and she said they were full inside and had a private party coming
The salmon, the bread, and the pasta is always great! But if I find someplace friendlier that is just as tasty I won't be back
Sometimes the music is bad pop, too, and does not fit the overall ambience
I had a little get together with some friends of mine at acqua santa and it was great
The garden is a beautiful place to eat and the food matches the atmosphere
Excellent food and service and it was really cheap, we'll definetely be back
I am writing to say how happy my husband and myself were to have our Wedding at Giando's
It was everything we wanted and more
We wanted for nothing and were treated like a King and Queen
The people who we delt with for our Wedding were real people down to earth and nothing we beyond them doing for us
We had the night of our lives and the best part is we can go to the restaurant and enjoy the place as Our Place and we have many times and will in time to come
I thank Ellen and Alex for being so wonderful to us and all our guests
We knew when we walked in to see the place that this was the place for us
Giando is a special place that combines a great restaurant with excellent catering hall also
This would be a great place to get married (we did!) Michael and Alex are top notch hosts
The food is excellent - italian dishes are authentic and generous
This is not a casual place but importantly not snobbish either
regular people will feel comfortable here
I will agree with previous review that sometimes the service can be lacking but not usually
All in all it is an excellent choice for a special dinner out with the absolute best view of the skyline - cannot be beat
prices are reasonable for what you are getting
Very Romantic too
A little pricey, but the food is very good
Service can leave a little to be desired at times
Can't beat the view though
The Scene Expect no frills at this working-man's steakhouse, a local landmark since 1887
Diners don't even get menus unless they ask; waiters are tersely matter-of-fact
The dining rooms, with their exposed beams and worn wooden furniture, are far brighter than they ought to be
But don't complain too loudly: Luger's fiercely loyal regulars will defend the place as passionately as they would their own mothers
The Food Everyone orders the hand-picked, dry-aged porterhouse steaks, and the butter-sluiced slabs arrive on lava-hot platters (remove the steak quickly to avoid overcooking)
German fried potatoes and creamed spinach are fine sides; starters include a salad of thick-cut tomatoes and onions, and crispy double-thick bacon
Desserts--chocolate mousse pie, New York cheesecake--are satisfying in an old-fashioned way and come with a giant bowl of whipped cream to pile on top
Just got back from Luger's today for my birthday, I have actually been going there for 10 years now and had to leave a review becasue I quite honestly am blown away how people can criticize the product they put out
You cant even describe how good this steak is
I defy anyone to tell me where else you can cut the steak with your fork, it practically melts in your mouth- and the sides are amazing
Creamy Spinach and German potatoes along with the incredible sauce
What are people looking for??? If you looking for ambeince forget it, its a beer hall
With the exception of Sparks Ive been to every major steakhouse in Manhattan and although the atmosphere may be nicer in some places (Palm and Morton's), no one comes close
I'll even go as far to say Old Homsestad is an embarrasment
A meal at Luger's is by far not a cheap affair, but i cant understand how you can't look at this as money well spent
Lugers is an amazing experience, and if you dont agree as your leaving, check out the wall on your left as the Zagat's plaques (ever hear of them?) have been rating it the top steakhouse in New York 15 years in a row
Anyone how is down on Luger's is an amateur and is best suited for Outback or maybe Charlie Brown's
We've tried various steakhouses in the city and this is by far not the best
We had a reservation and were seated promptly
The portion was rather small so this was the first time ever that we do not feel filled up after a portorhouse for two
Our steak was medium and our friend ordered his rare, but it was served medium (looked exactly the same like ours), no fluid was coming out at all
Having spent $70 for each person, we were quite disappointed and felt sorry for our money
When the waiter brought us the check, he even reminded us that you know that the tip is not included
Thank you, we will never come back again
This place is not the fanciest nor most fashionable but the steaks are the BEST
I do not eat steak but I do eat PETER LUGER steak
This place is a must! Oh, it is cash only and the sauce
the Peter Lugar sauce, is not for the steak but the tomatoes
Good luck getting a reservation!
I was expecting carnivourous bliss
Maybe it was an off night or the steak were better once-ok, I'll say it, it just wasnt the best steak in NY!! The sirloin side just wasnt that tender although the filet potions, strangly, were the best Ive had
One thing that bothered me was the standard cut
If you order the famous porterhouse for 3 or 4, its just 2 48oz porterhouses on a plate, and the cuts werent that thick(to get that nice sear on the outside and thin layer of raw inside for my medium rare taste
)   Strangely, the service was excellent
Our waiter Karl was friendly and attentive(in an old german man way
) Karl and his entourage served our party of 10 with the gruff efficiency of a mercedes assembly line
Anyway, great experience, and that;s what I'll chalk it up to

The best part of the meal was the garlic bread
There is also a bar that is part of the restaurant and the game was on and there were men screeming and making a whole scene over the game, very disrupting
So, I would not recommend going here
I have been coming here for years and it's always great
They change any dish to your liking and you can have as much salad and garlic bread throughout your meal
The steamers are my favorite since it's not often to find a big bucket of them in NYC for this price
Great food, great value and always a terrific meal
Ok here's the deal
I have been comin ghere for about 10 years now
My girlsfriends and I love the place for one thing and one thing only
THIER LOBSTER! We have ordered other dishes their and have been dissapointed
If you like lobster this is the place to go
The prices are great and comes with all the extras
Salad and sides
Not to forget the garlic bread that comes out is entoxicating! The wait staff could not be friendlier
All in all stick to the lobster and you will be a happy camper!
After living in the neightborhood for 4+ years, we finally decided to finally stop in and try it
I mean, the restaurant has been there for years so it must be at least reliable, good food, right? WRONG! The clam chowder was watery, fish (from the fish and ships) were all batter and tasted like low quality fish
The crab legs were soft on the outside (the shell) and mealy on the inside
A huge disappointment, and after talking to some neighbors, we 'should have known better by the shappy interior and uncleanly appearance of the waitstaff
I couldn't believe the quality of the seafood, after reading the reviews that described freshness
I ordered beer-battered fried shrimp for $9
95, and it was of poorer quality than a place like T
G
I
Friday's - very bland
In addition, I received so little shrimp - 6 to 8 pieces; how it could possibly qualify as a main entree is beyond me
It doesn't take much to get fresh shrimp and coat it in some batter with flavor (how about adding some herbs or spices?)
Very disappointing
for their lunch specials, they sure beat big mac's item for item for price
rather pay $8
95 vs
$6
75 for macdonald's for better food, there lies the value
what you get with lunch one would pay double elsewhere! talk about good for one's budget!
For $12 (which includes tax and a tip) you get a side salad, main course AND two glasses of champagne, wine or beer!  You can't beat that for a lunch time special!

I've heard and read good reviews of this place that I had to give it a shot
I ordered the scallops and shrimp over rice
Boy was that a mistake!! It was old tasting and was not flavorful
It's apparently a place where people are trying to get a cheap seafood meal and that lack of quality speaks for itself
We found Coldwaters by accident and have been going ever since
There is not much atmosphere, but the food,service, and prices are great
I recomend it to anyone who loves seafood!
been there once and going back again and again
i went to burger king and payed more for the food than i payed at coldwaters
And to think that i was eating fish for that price it was incredible
No refills but who needs one after a 1/2 carafe of wine for me! Bryan and Marcelo made me feel very comfortable during my brunch with my wife
I'll be back and look for Bryan or Marcelo to help you out
ambience, quantity and quality
Top rated for the prices they are sending their food for
Its almost as if they are giving away their food
Ive been there on brunches and for only 8
95 in midtown manhattan u get: a half carafe of wine,a salad w homemade dressing, an entree and a choice of side
Service was fair with a manager coming to help us
At least hes there to watch his guests and make sure everything was fine
Coffee needed work though
like this place because it's so close to home
The prices are reasonable and the service is good
But the fish never seems very fresh, especially on weekends
Pescatore is better
great prices and delicious seafood make this a great spot for lunch or dinner
the staff is very attentive, service is fast, and portions are huge
definitely worth a visit!
freshest fish I've had anywhere
The portions were huge, the prices ridiculously low
Where else in ny can you get maine steamers or a lobster at 3 am? The menu is so big I go at least twice a week and never get bored
I have eaten at Coldwaters several times and have found it very reasonable with adequate food and service
It is definitely worth it for the price
The last time I was there I had the whole stuffed broiled trout which was really very good
The service was rather slow but our waiter was very pleasant and obliging
I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a gourmet meal but I certainly would recommend it for an inexpensive fish dinner after work
Too cool by far
Temperature wise, decor wise and service wise
Food was quite good, but expected more
And by the way, had to queue for the Ladies' room
Venue currently falls short of its first-rate capacities, kitchen and service suffering too-frequent lapses
This especially odd, as Chef himself is often trotting about
Tasting menu a mixed bag: lobster soup amuse with grapefruit intriguing, but marred by excess bitterness as prepared
Bland pate de fois gras ice cold on a cold slice of brioche
Crab cake, however, a graceful and delicate treat
Salmon a bit overcooked; Veal cheeks a standout succulent w/heady demi-glace w/jalapeno pepper punctuation: Chef's on point here
Decent cheese course
No palate-cleanser offered
Dessert tasting: a tired disappointment
Hot apple cider served ice cold
Service distant and mechanical: precise, but ungracious and disinterested
No gourmandises offered
Wine selection good under $ 100; room nicely-lighted if a bit noisy and cavernous
You wont leave feeling cheated, nor with eager anticipation of your return as there is a distinct lack of joie de vivre here
The Scene White brick walls, granite-gray banquettes and stripped-down architectural columns create a stark impression by day, but at night a stylish second-date crowd and an open wood-burning oven warms the place up
On nearly every table, tall girly drinks--watermelon martinis, raspberry mojitos, coconut cosmos--add splashes of South Beach color
The Food Despite the restaurant's name, the menu is remarkably Atkins-friendly, from the nibble bowls of spicy fried chickpeas to the grilled slabs of salt-flecked, smoky rib-eye, succulent chunks of rosemary roast chicken and fat tubes of springy grilled squid
Arugula salad sparkles with lemon and parmesan, while spinach and ricotta-filled panzarotti are swathed in a lush walnut sauce
Not everything works: The rosemary-stuffed branzini can be dry, pesto pasta lacks flavor and the cutting board of cheeses and salami is generic
For dessert, fresh berries, vanilla gelato and flaky butter cookie come together in an elegant take on strawberry shortcake
a very casual place to the casual lovers, you can go there with your pijamas
food is fine, not spectacular but that is what you expect anyway
Probably the worst service i've ever had, I don't think the waiter could have messed up our order any more
We ordered a red wine, they brought out white

Still not as good as Flor's Kitchen but the amibience is excellent in Cocotero
We have eaten at El Cocotero four times recently with different guests and each time has been excellent
Great food, ambiance and friendly service
Do not miss it!
First, the good news - In an ambience of south of the border, Lucho, the chef, generously dishes up his Venezuelan tasty morsels like a mother hen feeding her brood
Small, intimate and friendly, dipping the yuca fries with friends is worth the trip to Chelsea
Second, the bad news - I live in Los Angeles and dream of a return trip
In Short Crowds of couples, teenagers and parents with toddlers press up against the long refrigerated display case at this dessert chain, where a variety of ice creams, frozen yogurts and sorbets are made in-store daily
Customers choose flavors like sweet cream, cake batter or banana, add mix-ins--ranging from candy bar chunks and Gummi bears to hot fudge and peanut butter--then servers mash it all together on a frozen slab of granite
I used to go to times squea
They are busy always
But this one, we don't have to wait
In Short Modern red banquettes, glass-topped tables and wall-to-wall windows provide the setting for casual breakfasts and lunches; later, the lights are dimmed and candles cast a flattering glow
The menu spans traditional espresso shop fresh pastries, but the full kitchen also serves up omelettes, egg sandwiches on challah, assorted paninis and sandwiches, and shareable fondue and meat-and-cheese platters
Specialty espresso drinks are available with or without alcohol, and wine and beer are also available
We placed a delivery order - 2 pastas and a caprese and they took and 1 1/2 to get here and the food was inedible when we received it
Overcooked pasta and watery sauce
Further, when we called, they were unapologetic about the amount of time it took to receive our order and further we were told the pasta takes a long time to cook
This is interesting since penne takes 10 minutes when I cook it
Maybe this is a good place to go to but I certainly would never recommend them for delivery
After this negative experience I am discouraged from ever visiting the place in person either
I went to Mocca with my boyfriend for a few drinks and food, and I was really impressed by the service
We didn't like the first seat because the table was vibrating (?), and the waitress quickly agreed
The second table was even nicer, in a romantic little corner
We ordered falafel and the avocade pesto sandwich
Falafels were decent (slightly overpriced), but the sandwich was amazing
I just wish they have more vegetarian offering and bigger portioned nibblers
We ordered several fruit cocktails, all were wonderful and refreshing, and I really like the strawberry coco and banana drink
A bit pricey, but wonderful atmosphere
Mocca Lounge is my favorite place- for hot chocolate, a drink, or when i'd like to grab something to eat
Their sandwiches are exquisite- something that cannot be found anywhere else, and the place was designed in great taste
What i like about this place is that it changes atmosphere- it's nice to sit there for a cup of coffee or to eat there during the day beacuse the service is fast and the food is very good
but it's even nicer to meet there with friends in the evening because the place transforms completely- the music is different, the lights are dimmed, and you can actually enjoy the ambient atmosphere and the great bar any night of the week!  In short- Mocca is now officially my favorite place! (and i am usually very picky about new places
)
Mocca just keeps getting better
food,desserts, coffee, outrageous hot chocolates, cocktails, relaxing, comfortable atmospere, karaoke nights (one night I swear Elvis was in the room), the place is just awesome
Always served and greeted with friendly smiles day or night, dining amongst a really cool and fun clientele
Priced right too!
I get my coffee there and muffin every morning
Good stuff
They also have some good pastries, Chocolate Croissants (or pain au chocolat)
Best thing about it is the design, red banquettes and glass table
one of the few options for coffee/cappucinos in the neighborhoods, aside from Starbucks
With its stylishly amicable environment and delightful array of drinks, Mocca serves as not only a hot spot to grab a cup of joe, but also as a relaxingly place to sit and chat
The brightly colored walls and modestly upbeat music set the ideal atmosphere for a pleasant after-work mixer
Moreover, the staff at Mocca is sincerely charming and outright welcoming
Without reservations anyone can enjoy this lounge, and it is without reservation that I recommend it to you
My co-workers and I went for the two-for-one deal after work and had a good time
The special cocktails were great and it was nice not to have to pay a fortune for them
We did get some dirty looks when we got a little loud- it isn't really for rowdy crowds and it was hard to get the waitress's attention- she kept forgetting about us! The atmosphere and music are cool and it is so convenient!
Been going here regularily recently and i've enjoyed myself everytime
first time i stopped by, the owners stopped by my table and introduced themselves and they seem to be really cool people
they serve some great drinks here, and everyone in the area should def stop by to check it out
great to meet up with friends here for a quick bite before going out and then have a couple of drinks too
definitely recomended
This place is amazing! I felt like I was in Europe all over again
Not only do they serve top of the line espresso
But they also serve Italian paninis/desserts/ cocktails
My absolute favs are the raspberry mojitos espresso martinis
Must not miss out on this place check it out soon!
Mocca is just what Tribeca needed
Awesome drinks, awesome apps and to-die-for coffee
Sweet place to relax after a long day
The mojito's are my fav!!! Order one of their platter fabulous platters to pick on
It comes out on a lazy susan!  P
S
2 for 1 happy hour
Now you can't beat that!
For the coffee connoisseurs, this place has some of the best coffee in the city
They set such high standards on their coffee that if you feel the coffee/espresso is not to your liking, just simply tell the waitstaff or barrista; and they will glady make you another one
Also, it is one of the few premium coffeeshops that's opened until 2 to 4 am
Their cocktail menu is also excellent
It's a perfect pre-going out spot
sit and enjoy a cup of joe, cocktail, and/or dessert after dinner before hitting the town, or just stay the whole night and enjoy the lounge music and atmosphere in this quaint spot at the edge of Tribeca
I went there last weekend and was pretty amazed that something like this finally opened up in the area
Great lounge with some great decor and amazing drinks
I forget the name (blame the martinis) but the passionfruit martini is excellent and so is the strawberry one
Great selection of vodkas for the dirty martini drinker
i definitly recommend the place wholeheartedly
Not the typical cheap Mexican joint with loads of bland fillers, thus its more pricey than some but worth the price difference
Marguarita's are delicious and not missing any taste or liquor! The food is great tasting and protioned appropriately
Happy place to go after work,fresh good mexican food and the margaritas will make your day
In Short Swish is a small space offering an untraditional take on classic cook-at-the-table shabu shabu
Diners construct their own meals from a choice of five cooking broths, six savory sauces, and more than 20 ingredients, including fresh shrimp, sliced steak, mushrooms, squid, fried fish, noodles, and vegetables
In addition to these options, the restaurant offers pre-composed combos for two, a host of other Japanese dishes, bubble teas, and occasional surprises like chocolate fondue

With a contagious smile, Hershey, the manager, will give you some great pointers on all things Shabu-Shabu
Before long you'll be swishing like a pro
Don't forget to bring an impressionable friend to show off your new skills
You'll have a ball
Before you Shabu-Shabu, try some delicious sushi with hearty portions
Just remember to save some room for the fried ice cream
Yummy
Inexpensive, fun and tasty, I left satisfied, and excited to tell everyone about my new favorite restaurant
The space is small as are the portionsdont expect to be satiated unless you are prepared to order an abundance of food and that may prove to be an expensive proposition
As is typical with this style of cooking, your level of enjoyment will depend entirely on how you choose to dress your food
Fortunately they offer a variety of six sauces for your dipping pleasure
FYIstick with the shabu shabu, anything that the kitchen cooks will undoubtedly disappoint
This is a great place! The ingredients are fresh, tasty, and well-balanced in terms of variety (and yes, even food groups)
The myraid of sauces and customizable temperature settings allow you to concoct the perfect pot of deliciousness

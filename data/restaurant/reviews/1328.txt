What a major disappointment
We sat for 25 mins w/o sight of a waiter
It was so hot in the upstairs alcove! Ordered the Artichoke fondue There was no fondue
just grilled artichokes and a pile of goat cheese
Chicken liver dumplings were a joke, deep fried dough with some chopped liver in it
Entrees were 'ubber' small
Ok for Mary Kate and Ashley, but not for anyone who actually eats
Bill came, gave my CC
The receipt came back with a total $15 more than the bill, when I questioned the waiter if gratuity was includehe said no, opps my bad? By the way I called @ 5pm and got a 7:30 resevation for the same night
Amy stick to the clubs!
In a city full of restaurants with great food at good prices, there is no reason to eat at this trendy destination
The food is overpriced, plain and boring
The scene is not particularly attractive and there were no famous, chic people anywhere to be found
Moreover, after hearing rumors of month-long waits for reservations, the place was half-empty
The people, the space, the cocktails, Amy Sacco has done it again
The Bunglow 8 of restaurants, we've all heard about Bette's wild reservations policies, but beg borrow and steal to get that 5:30 reservation to dine at the classiest, most A-list (Amy Sacco's friends are the only one's allowed so far, so the people watching is unparalled) restaurant in the hippest neighborhood in Manhattan
The atmosphere is absolutly fabulous
The food is allright too, but lets face it, that's not why we're here :)
My friends and I recently had a party in the private back room of Il Bastardo
We had a wonderful experience interacting with the friendly manager who walked us through the process
We had an intimate and amazing night that would have cost a fortune anywhere else
It truly is one of the best secret party spots in the city
We recently had brunch at this establishment with two other couples and I have to say I was majorly dissapointed with the service and how we were treated
Our server (after 4 reminders) finally got around to getting our cocktail orders during the meal (at a time when the establishment was not full)
While the meal was tasty we were not happy with the service and showed our discord in the small tip left
It was at this point the the server and manager confronted us on the sidewalk of the restaurant
The manger then told us (without accessing what our displeasure with the service had been), that we were not welcomed to come back to his restaurant
Judging from the service that we received, I didn't think were welcomed the first time
Everything from the service and food to the ambiance has been consistantly a great experience! I have entertained many clients at this establishment who have also gone back for more
The bar is also a great hang with a comprehensive wine list and attentive service!
I recently stopped by Il Bastardo for a quick drink thursday night
My quick drink ended up turning into a pretty late night at The Bastard
The bartenders there are extremely friendly and know how to make great drinks
Luckily, I decided to try some of their food while I was there
The risotto was excellent
The dish was surprisingly big
I was only able to eat half! I am definitely coming back soon!
From the moment you walk in everyone makes you feel at home (if only home could be this good)
Try the mixed grill and caprese at the bar with a wonderful selection of Italian varietals; you will love the experience
At the tables, we have enjoyed the steak and scallops seared to perfection
Antonio is our favorite server
But they are all good people
Since their doors opened Il Bastardo has never disappointed me the many times I stopped by
This is somewhere I bring clients and friends alike
David behind the bar will mix you up the most tasty and fresh cocktails while sporting a beautiful smile and personality
I do not eat red meat, however everything else from seafood to pasta that I have tried has always gone beyond my expectations
They are a wonderful addition to an exceptional neighborhood
Stop by, you will not be disappointed
I was referred to Il Bastardo by a friend who has become a regular
My friends and I went there last week for one of their birthdays
The food was great with lot's of variety and service was really friendly and fun
It was nice to actually see Italians work and eat in an Italian restaurant
I highly recommend the skirt steak! The scene was Chelsea trendy and we were not rushed and really got to enjoy our night out
I have definately found my new favorite place for dinner and with its large bar for hanging out on the weekends
We dined here last weekend and loved every moment of the experience from when we entered the door
Our server, a native of Napoli, was gracious and knowledgeable about the food
The wine list is extensive, with many Italian varietals you can't find in other restaurants
And well priced! Many bottles run around the 30-40$ range
The Ravioli ala Vodka is superb and my date had the Filetto di tonno and was equally impressed
We tried a Key Lime Pie martini afterwards and were in cocktail heaven
Great Food, Great People, Great Place!
Bar - hot, but crafty
$6 change for 3 drinks, a $5 and a $1
dirty trick to get tips in my mind Waitstaff - bumbling, poorly trained, bad communication skills, friendly
spilled a drink on guest of honor
zero comp, retribution, concern, etc
Steak - Porterhouse for 2 was served for 1, overspiced, overpriced and tasted frozen, with a hint of msg Dessert - best part of meal, good espresso Overall - if food quality matters to you over pretty lights and models handing you towels in the bathroom, i don't recommend
very disappointing and a money trap
Went for Sunday Brunch at 1:00PM
The lovely restaurant was virtually empty - which is hard to understand because for $15
00 we had great food and unlimited Bloody Mary's or Mimosa's
I had the pancakes and my friend had the asparagus fritatta
Both were delicious
What a great addition to the neighborhood
Popped into this restaurant with a friend on a whim for dinner, with no to low expectations
I expected more style and substance, but was surprised to find the service very attentive and the food very well prepared
A great surprise
I prefer the tables in the back room with exposed brick which provides a wonderful ambience
And the waiters are cuter than cute, but also good at what they do
Il Bastardo is my new love child
The skirt steak was excellent -- it had a delicate seasoning that made it taste great
In addition, the fish of the day was perfectly prepared and served with a nice amount of frites and vegetables
The cocktails were great and they have an extensive wine selection
All in all, it's a place with a great vibe, really good service and excellent food
I dined with a friend at Il Bastardo yesterday and I must say it was wonderful
I asked to speak with the Chef, Joseph Cacace and wound up having a wonderful conversation about Wine, Food and Film! (I wish we could have spoken longer, but I'll be back)  I had a Strip Steak, perfectly cooked with a nice little salad of greens and baby vegetables
My friend had the grilled Red Snapper, which was fresh and really flavorful
We also split a special pasta entree (I know, pigs!) which the Chef recommended, which was a pasta gratin with pancetta topped with herbed bread crumbs and a bit of white truffle
WOW !!
The ambiance of this place is amazing, the food is just as good, the bar scene is terrific, I will be back this week!
Ive never had a steak so delicious in my life
My blossoming twins agree
Since Bastardo has opened I have eaten there 3 times! Im sure wewill be back before birth!
I recently went to dine at IL BASTARDO restaurant (steakhouse) and i have to say that i was impressed with the service, and the food was extremely delicious
I most definetively recommend this place to anyone that's looking for good service, great food, nice ambience at reasonable prices!!
It was my birthday and my friends came to Brooklyn from the city to help me celebrate
We were told by the bartender that for a table of 6, we had to wait 20-25 minutes
On a Tuesday night with no reservation, we thought that was normal and we gladly waited at the bar
We ordered ONE bottle of wine and ONE beer - for which we wound up waiting 15 minutes
We were assured repeatedly that our outside table would be ready any minute

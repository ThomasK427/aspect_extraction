It is, without a doubt, the best pizza I have ever had
Classic coal oven pies, Sinatra on the juke and steps away from an amazing view of the city
what's not to love?
This is definitely the best pizza in the city
Great service as well!
Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious and it is difficult to go back to regular old slices
Grimaldi's is great- they use fresh ingredients for the pizza, and the restaurant has a nice family kind of feel to it
If you like deep dish, you may be disappointed, as Grimaldi's only does thin crust, but if you want the best New York pizza, come here
I used to think Lombardi's served the best pizza in the city, but then I happened in on Grimaldi's en route to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory one day
Absolutely delicious pizza
We must have just missed the rush because we were seated right away, but saw the line down the block when we left
Followed by a scoop of butter pecan topped with hot fudge from the Factory, this is one of the best ways to spend a summer Saturday afternoon by the waterfront
The best, bar none (with apologies to Lombardi's in Little Italy and Dennino's on Shao Lin)
Gimmie a red and white! The only sentence you need utter a Grimaldi's in order to experience the best that this pizzaria
Whether you prefer yours with or whithout sauce, or like a little of both, this is New York thin crust pizza at it's finest! The marvelous location at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridges provides an excelent locale for an after dinner stroll
If you like pizza, you have to try Grimaldi's
The menu is pretty much only pizza however I think it could benefit from a simple mixed salad
The location is great too because you are right under the Blkyn Bridge and can enjoy the skyline after your meal (or while waiting for a table) from a nearby prier
Enjoy!
I cant believe this was top rated
And I cant believe this got so many 10's
I am maybe assuming Grimaldi's just had a bad day on the day I went
The servers were snobby and got mad at me when I asked if they serve by the slice
He acted completely put out that I even wanted to eat
Dont get me wrong, I love a laid back atmosphere, but you shouldn't have to fear for your life when you go out to eat
Plust the pizza wasn't even good
I only ate it because I was starving
Completely bland
Lombardi's was WAY better
I bumped into this restaurant by accident after being ejected from a wedding reception at the restaurant down the street
Their loss! The sauce is amazing, the crust is tasty and the service is so sweet
Just remember to bring cash
Heard about the place for years, finally made my way to the base of the Brooklyn Bridge to try it
The pizza really is excellent
Is it the best - who can really say
It's better than average, very tasty and a nice alternative to your corner neighborhood shop
It was a voyage getting here (subway, then a short hike) and a bit of a wait to get in, but well worth it
The pies here are crisp and not overloaded with toppings
Just a nice crust, a subtle (but fresh-tasting) tomato sauce and a bit of cheese
It's comfortable and crowded -- almost family-style
Carafes of wine are pretty cheap, too
Only been here one time, but it was truly worth all the hype I'd heard
The superflavorful sauce makes it, and the crust is crust without losing flavor
Great toppings and a sweet neighborhood
I prefer Grimaldi's over John's, personally
And none of John's locations has the great Brooklyn vibe that Grimaldi's has
The ingredients are fresh, which especially comes through in the tangy tomato sauce
Cap off your visit with a stroll down to the river, and take in one of the best views of the Manhattan skyline
just not the best
Which doesn't mean it's not worth a trek over the Brooklyn Bridge
The ingredients are fabulously fresh and the pizza's well-prepared -- but the crust doesn't match up to John's
Nonetheless, it's an excellent pie -- and don't let the long lines scare you off -- they keep them moving
If you've gone to Rosscoe's East Chicken Waffle House since it's re-opening in Feburary you will know exactly how I feel this moment
The amibence, food, and service is outstanding
The price is unbelievable too
Hidden on the corner of Church and Brooklyn Avenue is a Gem
When you walk in the restaurant you automatically feel as if you've entered a 5-star ok 4-star restaurant in an upscale neighborhood
What a great place to take a date
I tried to take a break; but the food is very additive
Everything on the menu is GREAT, I mean GREAT
My teenage daughter loves the food; especially when her date takes her to Rosscoe's East instead of some fast food or dingy restaurant
And don't forget to try their Cheese Cake
Look out Junior's
I had always heard about this from my California counterparts, so I was glad when they opened a spot in New York (in Brooklyn, no less!) That was the best Chicken 'n gravy that I've tasted! Add some grits, eggs and biscuits to the mix and you've got good eatin'! My only complaints -- the eggs and location of the restaurant
It's hard to find someone to do your eggs just the way you like them
This place should be located downtown brooklyn (Clinton Hill or Brooklyn Heights), not in Flatbush/Crown Heights! You won't notice the place if you're drivng too fast
People unfamiliar with the area and the carribean culture of the surrounding of the surrounding community might be put off by it's location
However, the stylish decor and good food will quickly make you forget all that
This is a good place to take a date too!
This is probably one of the best Italian pastry shops in the USA
Everything is alway fresh and delicious
No one in Manhattan can come close to their quality
Italian cheesecake, Cassata Al Forno and pastries you never saw in other bakeries are great
There ba ba rum is filled to order with yellow custard or cannoli cream as you wait
Great cookies also and the best cannoli you ever tasted!! Shells are thin and crispy
Brick oven crispy bread adds to the attraction
The owner, Steven Carroll, insists that you are family here
On a first date?
come here and order the best house wine and apps in Bensonhurst! A family outing?
they will feed you till you bust! A group of friends?
the perfect place to get your buzz going, and fill up before you start the night out on the town
I recommend asking Steven himself for one of the special for the night
there's a reason why they are specials, they really are! Enjoy at this homey, romantic, down to earth and very affordable Classic Italian Cafe and Restaurant!!!!
For a restaurant called Red Crab, you'd think that their seafood would be good
I ordered the seafood platter - the shrimp was hard and overdone, as were the mussels
You could tell that the crab wasn't fresh, and the lobster wasn't as tender as it should have been
Other meals - beef stroganoff was simple and almost soupy, lamb chops a bit gamey, only the sushi didn't get complaints
The waitress was attentive to our large group, but I think that's because there was only one other table occupied!
gino's is thwe best place to eat and the workers r nice people especially me and my fiance favorite waitress is diane and the food is great and fulling
A refreshing break from the buttoned up Manhattan Italian restaurants, La Palina is as old school as it gets
Great for a large family get together, the wait staff has yet to turn down a special request in front of me
A perfect Italian version of comfort food
My grandparents considered it a staple restaurant, and hopefully my grandkids will as well
The 3 dollar signs are misleading
it's extremely affordable
You get treated like a regular even if it's your first time there
Take the kids
take friends
take yourself
don't miss out!!!

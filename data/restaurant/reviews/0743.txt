Their food serving timing is off
Courses should be served simultaneously to all in a given party
My best friend brought me here for the first time for some lunch and a drink
She couldn't stop raving about Peep b/c of the overall quality and low price
Wow she was right
The service so pleasant and accomodating, the FOOOd is wonderful, and the minimal cost is always a bonus
I continue to come back to Peep and tell everyone I can about it
I reccomend the Pad Thai, which I can't say I have had any better
and the Faint cosmo is $10, but DELecious! Go to Peep you won't regret it!
With 10 people on a Friday night at 10pm, we arrived promptly and with confirmed reservations, it took them about 30 minutes to seat us
Then we found out we were sitting at the bar and on stools! It wasn't too comfortable
The wait staff's service was quick and attentive
The food was the most unique dishes I've ever had and fantastic! For appetizers, we had seared scallops and calamari
The duck is similar to the roast duck you get in Chinatown
The Black Noodles - chow fun noodles with squid ink was great! It was a little spicy, but the best chow fun I've ever had! For dessert, we had fried ice cream, mini toasts with green tea ice cream this condensed milk dip
It's a small-ish place, not good for groups
Peep is a great restaurant to know - great food, never had a problem getting a table, trendy, but not painfully so and tremendous value
A must for taking unpretentious guests from out of town - just make sure they visit the restrooms
I love Peep! I can't believe that a place like this, with the cool bathrooms, inviting bar, wonderful Thai food, AND is in SOHO could be so cheap
Dinner for four with drinks was a little less than $100
Amazing
Try the ginger calamari and all of the saute dishes were good
I've had better Pad Thai but it was still good for people who don't eat Thai too much
Go immediately
First you must use the restroom
The food was delicious
There were so many different flavors combined into one, the taste was unique
Decor was enjoyable as well
This place was wonderful!! My friends and I hold a monthly dinner party and one of the girls picked this place
I was a little nervous after reading a few of the reviews listed here but we didn't experience any problems
The wait staff was friendly, our waiter gave us great recommendations, and we were seated right away (party of eight)
The food was amazing! We had a bunch of apps and then entrees - not one person in the group complained and everyone's plates were clean at the end! The drinks were also incredible!!!
The bathroom is definitely worth a visit, even though it's fun the first time only
What motivates me to go back is its food
The green curry is very good, the duck is superb and the dumpling appetizer is tasty
I find the ambience a little too pink but it's what separates itself from other Thai restaurants in town
With all the glitz and glam that Lower Manahattan has to offer us in culinary and visual delights
Pepp has found a way to stand alone
where most restraunts in the city offer an elegantly overpriced menu with mediocore food and zazzed up drinks wih a fizzel effect in our tatse buds
Peep offers fantastic drink , the triple berry cozmo is by far the best I have ever had , and all the food from the calamari to the strawberry shortcake is unbelievably affordable and melts in your mouth - and beyond the late hours , great food and service , fab drinks , and hot waiters
is the HOT HOT bathroom
Ill let you go and see it for yourself
but be sure to wear your best tighty whities
;)
I took my very dear friend to this place and it was a nightmare
When we arrived we were never greeted, and walked in on our own to find a seat
then they yelled at us and told us to go back to the bar and wait to be seated
the dizzy hostess told us 5 minutes for a table and yet there were 3 tables avaialbale in the back
Once we were seated by the door way it was cold and it took 15 minutes before we ordered and an hour later our food never showed up
The waitress naver cam back and I had to search for the manager who was very nasty and expected me to pay for food I never ate
We walked out and were very disgusted with the place
its Higly over rated
Tried Peep for the first time witha girlfriend and we were both blown away
The food was fantastic (the mussel soup was out of this world), the service was attentive and overall just a tremendous value for NYC
I'll be going back for sure!
The best part of Peep is the ambiance - it's all mirrors and baubly shapes, making you feel like you're having dinner aboard the S
S
Enterprise - in the Next Generation
(Not to mention the bathrooms encased in 2-way mirrors, which give you pee anxiety in a good voyeuristic kind of way
) The food is Thai with an American twist; flavorful dishes appropriated to the American palate
I took my boyfriend and roommates out to dinner there, and we all shared a bunch of the smaller dishes, all unbelievably priced at $6 bucks or less
Not only were the portions generous and the food hot, delicious and fresh, but our tab for the night for four people was fourty five bucks
And you can't beat that with a bat
The place is pretty trendy, therefore my food expectations weren't that high, I was surprised when my appetizers were all so yummy! The food was really tasty and for the price, you can't go wrong!  The selection was really great! The portions are filling and worth every dime!
Upscale thai, chic environs, inexpensive, soho location AND tasty cocktails
who would ever guess? I pop in here periodically to grab cocktails and dinner
Interesting restrooms (thus the name Peep)
The first time I have been to this place, right after it opened, I loved it
The friend I went there with said, it reminded him of skiing in French Alps
Well, just like skiing, the place went downhill and all there is to it now, are the funky bathrooms
Compared to most Thai restaurants, this is one of the trendiest
The funky decor and interesting bathroom make it a fun place to eat reasonably priced Thai food
The noise level was quite high but what can you expect when you are serving tasty food in a small space packed with people
Food came fairly quickly but the waiter didn't come to see if we needed anything else
We were shopping in the village and came acroos this place and were extremely impressed with space, from the ceiling to the cool bathroom
Great job designing, and the cute little waiters and hostesses! I love Thai food and although theirs wasnt that impressive, just blah, the presentation was great and sometimes that says a lot
I have to admit that we did have hunt the waiter down a couple of times but that was the biggest problem
Definitely a cool place to enjoy with friends or even a date
Went last night
Waited an hour for a table, and then got sat at a terrible table between the waiter station and a bathroom
When asked to move we were refused because a large party was coming in and would need the other available tables
10 minutes lates one to the two available tables was given to a party the same size as mine
The other table was never used the entire time of our meal and the party of 25 never showed
We repeatedly tried to question the hostess and then the manager, both of whom lied to us
They didn't seem to care that we were unhappy or that their stories completley conflicted with one another
Great food but not worth the rude service
I can't say that this is the best place to go for Thai food, but I can say that the garlic calamari wasn't bad at all and the place itself was quite cozy and PINK
The waiter was extremely friendly, but the busboy seemed anxious to get us out the door
The bathroom is pretty cool, but if it didn't have the whole mirror thing, it wouldn't be anything special
Overall, it's a nice place to go to if you want to try something new, I don't think it'll be a place I'd frequent though
Fun place to bring a date or a friend! Everything on the menu look delicious, it was hard to decide what to order
Peep has become one of my favorite places to eat
=)
The best restaurant I've been to in Manhattan in a very long time
Great berry martinis! Went with a big party so we shared everything
There wasn't a thing on the menu I didn't like
Most importantly
you can't beat the prices!
Very decent, quality food and service in this pink neon joint
The bathroom wall and door are one-way mirrors so you can watch people eat while you, well, you get the idea

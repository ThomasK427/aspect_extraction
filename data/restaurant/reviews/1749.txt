Gene (the exec
chef) makes the perfect order of grits you willl ever taste
Other items: fried chicken, jerk pork and chicken, whiting, great sides and really, the list goes on
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants fantastic food--all for a very reasonable price
Also, a shout-out to my fierce waitress, Adobe
Good quality and nice selection of West Indian/Jamaican + Soul food
The place is pretty small and there's no receptionist when you walk in so you just stand around when first walk in
But they service you pretty well and you feel like you're down home in the South even though you're in the Big Apple
I suggest this restaurant over Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant anyday!!!
just wanted to find a simple place around the hood and ran across Maroons
whadya know this place was great
had so many items i wanted to try but went with Oxtail,Cod Fritters, beef patties and soem catfish
all of it was good
nice staff also
I had the pleasure of eating at Maroons two weeks ago
The staff is friendly
YOU ARE SEATED BY THE OWNER
The food was amazing, an exotic melange of flavor for those of us who wish to savour every bite as we eat
Amazing food, great prices, Maroons certainly raised the bar in the NYC restaurant business
Go to Maroons for great comfort food, large portions and a friendly and relaxed environment
Definitely try the fried green tomatoes, hush puppies, baked catfish and the fried chicken
They also have Jamaican food, which I haven't tried, but looks really good
Leave room for the amazing red velvet cake that they make on premise-- it's really unique
Seating can be a little tight for large parties
one of the better quality restaurants in chelsea
good selection of pasta
Le Zie is a great Chelsea spot for quality Italian food
The menu is pretty diverse ranging from their standard spaghetti and meatballs (which are excellent) to various fish and meat based dishes
They have a very extensive wine list and there are several excellent Italian wines available for $40 and under
The service has generally been good, although it can get a little crowded in the main dining room
Upstairs can feel a little desolate but better than waiting for a table in the main room
On rainy night in NYC, this neighborhood restaurant was a haven
The warm welcome we received and the cozy seating started the evening off
The service started off very leisurely
When we mentioned that we had theatre tickets, the waiter made certain that our dishes were served promptly and courteously
The appetizers and main courses were very, very good
We would definitely go back there for another bit of Venice
For their price range, I think they do a really good job of making the food look and taste fabulous
Their appetizers are the best part of the menu so my boyfriend and I always order 3 appetizers between the 2 of us
Interesting menu items everyone should try: steamed asparagus with egg and mushrooms (sooo yummy and healthy), tricolore salad, and pici
Le Zie is one of those small neighbordhood restaurants with a nice selection of wine and food, reasonable prices, and a quiet and cozy ambience
The place seems like its always busy in both the front and back rooms
There is an upstairs, but I'm not sure what goes on upstairs? The Beet Salad was excellent! I tasted the Gnocchi, Veal lasagna, and the Mushroom rissotto, all of which I tasted splendid
However, the lasagna was a little meaty and the rissotto, a bit oily (but I am very critical)
The service was ONLY fair! The waitstaff was slow and disinterested
Although I did not taste dessert, the menu includes the yummmy Italian standards! The experience overall was enjoyable, but I don't live in Chelsea and doubt I would make a special trip back
We were very pleased with Le Zie - the prices were right and the food was good
I had the bass served with beans and fennel
He had a fish special which we couldn't quite make out the name of - and didn't really love or hate so I'd go with the standards
I'd heard the meatballs and spaghetti are great - they're definitely on my list for next time
And a next time there will be because this place is worth going back to
Ignore the reviews which talk about pre-fab food -- if you go out to eat spaghetti and meatballs, you can get it here, but order intelligently, and you're in for a treat
Know something about Italian wine? you can get a great bottle for $25 or so
The Venetian appetizer platter alone was worth the total bill -- I've seen nothing like it in NYC -- so when the great pasta dishes came, my wife and I were elated
Making plans for our fourth visit here, this time with my 21-year-old son -- he'll love it too
We don't understand the popularity of this noisy, unpleasant Chelsea restaurant
The pre-fab food was served almost immediately after we ordered it (some of it too hot, some of it too cold)
It was badly prepared, tasted dreadful, and when we tried communicating our displeasure to our waiter, he shook his head and walked away
Terrible value
way overpriced
The bottle of wine was the only thing we enjoyed at this place
Dreadful experience
we won't be back!
The food was decent and well-priced but not worth having to deal with bad management
The busboy poored fish juice all over my jacket--so much that it was dripping off the bottom
The manager didn't want to reimburse me until I sent him the dry cleaning bill as proof
As if I enjoy walking around in a jacket that smells like fish! After I refused to do that, he suggested we get desserts on the house
I again refused because I wasn't planning on eating desert
Then I spent 10 minutes convincing him that he needed to take $10 off our bill to compensate for dry cleaning expenses
Talk about poor business skills! Any decent restaurant manager would have comped my meal without hesitation
So eat there at your own risk
A quick wait for a tiny table where the service was A+
The caesar salad was capital
My crispy baked salmon arrived atop delicious sauted spinach
Every bite was a treat
After dinner tea arrived in a mini French press the perfect finish to a satisfying meal on a chilly autumn evening
The food here is really great
don't try to hold your breath through the specials though as the list is extremely long
And don't forget, they only take cash
We go here all the time
The food is delicious, the service is usually quite good, and the prices are downright fantastic for New York
Would I go here for a quiet, romantic first date? No
But as far as the place to go when we want to go out and have a great meal for not a lot of money, this is it
Many voted Le Zie's meatball spaghetti is best in the city, and I agree! One of the best casual Itaian in town!
If you like eating mediocre overpriced food in a noisy subway car, this is the place for you
What's the attraction?
A great find! The staff, without exception was upbeat, helpful and extradorinarily nice
The quality of the food is on par with the service
For the money, this is one of the best meals I've had in New York
The decor an atmospehere is laid back
The noise level was perfect -- nobody needed to raise his voice to be heard, but there was plenty of background conversation to imbue the place with liveliness
Oh, don't forget the deserts
They give some of new york's best a run for their money
The Margaritas were perfect
The atmosphere was fun and cool
The staff was very friendly and with it
I reccomend the enchalatas verde
A good time was had by all
A gem of a restaurant! I stumbled upon El Rey walking back from the overhyped Meatpacking district, what an oasis on a hot day! The outside patio is big, kistchy, and fun! The fruit-flavored margraitas were the BEST I have ever had-watermelon was my favorite
The guacamole, chicken quesadillas and mole were yummy and plentiful

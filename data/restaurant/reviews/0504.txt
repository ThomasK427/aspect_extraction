I LOVE STARBUCKS!!! I ENJOY HAVING A COFFEE AND SITTING TO READ
Starbucks is ALWAYS a consistent, satisfying cup of coffee
They definitely tend to lean on the stronger side, so that's a personal taste preference
I like strong, but wouldn't say it tastes burnt
The skim latte never disappoints! You can't go anywhere for a coffee (above and beyond the Maxwell house standard cup) and not pay premium prices anymore, so that argument just doesn't hold
Also, I hate getting coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup (Timothy's is a perp here)!
Starbucks has a serious quality control problem
They will put anyone behind the counter that is untrained to make your coffee
In the end you become their guinea pig and as bitter as their coffee can taste
I love everything there
there is something for every mood!
This place is generally overpriced but they do make really delicious caramel macchiatos and cafe mochas for a special treat
I'm not a coffee expert
it all tastes the same to me
When I go to starbucks I don't even know what Grande, Latte etc
means
But their coffee is ok, and they have couches and stuff so you can hang out and drink coffee
pretty cool I guess
WAY overpriced for barely adequate coffee
Only go when completely desperate for my fix but would even prefer diner coffee
It is not just the fact that is is $$$ for even small portions BUT that is is not GOOD
McDonalds of coffee
Starbucks is perfect for anyone's caffeine needs
Smooth, creamy coffee that would leave anyone craving for more
My personal favorite is the Chai Tea which never fails to give me a zing when i need it the most
When you order a Starbucks Coffee you're guaranteed satisfaction
Many coffees are so bland or potent that you need to add tons of sugar
not Starbucks
it comes out right the first time
They provide you with such a wide variety of flavors, expressos, cappuccinos, iced coffees, teas, and so much more
I guarantee they won't disappoint you
Not only is there a fabulous assortment, but you're also provided with a cozy environment
If you just want to relax with a cappuccino or read a book with Chai Tea
let me tell you this is definitely the spot to be
Starbucks is the place to go for YOUR cup-a-joe!
Dreadful, unless you have a preference for burned coffee beans
Starbucks coffee ranks as one of the main reasons that American culture is ridiculed worldwide: Rather than spend the money for rich coffee beans, Starbucks uses a roasting process which burns the beans to yield a flavor which many people mistake as strong coffee
However, the staff is generally courteous
And the stores themselves often serve as convenient meeting spots or a comfortable place to spend a half hour
But I'd recommend sticking to their teas and juices -- anything but the coffee
The Starbucks on Broadway and 49th (or is it 48th?) is the best in the city! The service is good and 9 times out of 10 your drink comes out right
which is good for any Starbucks!
Sure it's a chain, which makes people think it's evil
But it's the richest, finest coffee around
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

The food is just major,major,major good and it is so good i can't even explain it I Highly Recommend this place it is in the subway station and it is the best best food ever especially, better than mcdonalds and any other restaurant in the world
The ambience is good the servive, price, food and more for sure more trust me everybody seemed to like this place
Except I saw a waiter drop a glass but, that was a mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will defenitley go back to Junior's
I would highly recomend Juniors at the Grand Centeral Terminal
The food was excellent but a bit pricey, although but not being from New York I have no way of knowing this is normal for New York or not
Portions were over sized and the hamburgers were far, far better than you could ever get at any fast food place, or even most sit down restaurants
The sevice was very good if not a little to too quick
It sometimes seemed more like pit row than a sit down restaurant, (If it looks like your done and you don't keep an eye on your plate the next time you turn around it might be gone)
PS  I tried a big piece of thier famous New York cheese cake and it was worth going back just for the cheese cake alone
Junior's has two locations in Grand Central terminal, the upstairs one serving take-out bakery items, while the downstairs one in the dining area seems to have fewer desserts but serves sandwiches and other breakfast and lunch items
The cheesecake served is worth a dent in your diet
Junior's serves a few varieties here by the slice including one with a dense chocolate mousse layer and chocolate icing that is almost too rich
They also have excellent hotdogs in the downstairs location to round out your diet
Also good black and white cookies, chocolate muffins, and cinnamon buns too
The Starwberry cheesecake is awsome! A 10PLUS!you can test them all and pick you've favorite but I know that even if you don't like cheesecake Junior's will make you @least like their! Food is nothing to brag about but the deserts are superb!
This place is okay, but could be far better
A few other cafes in the area have it beat in terms of atmosphere, food, and service
The coffee served here is nice, but it doesn't beat the self-serve that is available in the other establishments around the block
The service is by far the best aspect of the place, with people who are willing to help at all times and answer questions
Plus they don't have a minimum for credit card charges
While the people here were nice and the service was very good, the food was not very good - it was extremely greasy, the place did not offer alternatives such as egg whites and PAM spray instead of oil, coffee was average Crystal Rock Office Flavored Coffee - not the good coffee
Also, there was no value - everything was 300% mark up
If you are staying at the Arlington Hotel and are so staving that you can't wait to get to another diner or even a McDonalds - go here, but only in a stavation emergeny
All I can say is the Cuban sandwich mixed with their special house green sauce makes the best Cubano I have ever had
I always order to go but, if you go during lunch expect a LONG line of hungry patrons
Fantastic comfort food with addictive green sauce
Spotty service and sometimes long waits
Not the best ambiance, but worth it
No nonsense, food coma worthy dishes -complete with rice and beans
Great alternative to the ubiquitous lunch salad and soup/sandwich combos downtown

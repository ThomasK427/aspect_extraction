When you go, make reservations for the sushi bar, pull up a chair, and let the sushi chef set your menu (but be sure to add your input)
It will add up - about $100/person without drinks - but the food is truly worth it
but the service was so INCREDIBLY annoying
At no point during our dinner were we left alone to simply enjoy our food
Instead, Yasuda's swarm of waiters and waitresses hovered incessantly overhead, seizing any opportunity to fill a glass, reorganize the table, ask if we were done, and of course clear us out of there in under 80 min
If you're in a rush, this is the place to go
but at these prices most people prefer to take their time
I won't be returning anytime soon
Sushi Yasuda is a very expensive, very refined shrine devoted to the art of sushi
You may leave hungry, but you will have sampled some of the highest-quality sushi in the city, prepared by the city's most meticulous chefs
The service is almost stifling polite (they pushed in my chair behind me every time I returned from the bathroom), though the sushi chef preparing my food was casual and chatty
I loved the sparse, elegant decor, and the restrained pageantry of it all
After spending $45 on 12 pieces of sushi, I left hungry, but happy I had gone
We made a reservation for 9pm on a Thrusday evening
We ordered the omakase, paid a ridiculous amount of money and were thrown out of the place with the other patrons (it was not even 11pm) by the manager himself because he wanted to leave early
Our waiter had started to circle around our table like a shark after our 2nd dish, taking out plates when we were not even done
Even though we complained several times, they brought us the bill before dessert and the manager came to our table to mention he was closing the place for the night
OUT-RA-GEOUS! And the omakase was not even that great (certainly not for the price tag!!)
Do yourself a favour: go somewhere else for (better) sushi
Of the forty or so places I've frequently, this is arguably the best sushi in NYC
The presentation is pleasant and enjoyable, and the sushi chefs are extremely skilled and helpful
Be prepared to spend, but understand that it is well worth it
Beats out the other high-end traditional midtown places that i've tried
Beats downtown new-style places too
The freshness and selection of fish, and the perfect handling and presentation is really quite a thing
The portion sizes are small, but i find this to make for a more perfect mouthful
The price is entirely inline with other top places like Blue Ribbon or Hatsuhana, maybe a bit more expensive than Tomoe or Yama
Great fish, no doubt about it, different that you don't see in other places
Forget about any inovative dishes, just plain good sashimi and sushi
The place is plain as well: forget about Nobu-style ambiance, Bond-like music and bar, Next door Nobu good-looking crowds etc - just plain, got it? Service, ha, if you manage to communicate, than I would call it just OK, definitely over-rated at Zagat
At the end the bill: $300 - wow!! I was wandering why I didn't go to Daniel's or Alain Ducase
After all you can have great fish at Tomoe for a fraction of this money
The overall experience is nothing more than Tomoe's with the exeption that you don't have to wait
Amazing sushi
Fresh, just melts in your mouth
BUT host was very snobby, arrogant
Waitstaff was hovering in an almost corrective manner to fix whatever we were doing wrong! Sushimaker was also cocky and unnecessarily insulting
He told us we could eat as much ginger as we wanted since it was free
My friend and I were dressed down a little bit as East Villagers and were treated very differently than business folk
Too bad since we tell all our friends-- great sushi, terrible attitude
omakase with chef yasuda ranks slightly higher than a hedonistic trip to peter lugers
5 different toro, salmon, sea urchin, shrimp, saltwater eel, freshwater eel, scallop and toro roll is the ultimate meal
This is an absolutely amazing restaurant
From the minute you walk in you'll be amazed at the sheer beauty from the bamboo walls, tables, and bar
The service is wonderful as well
Everything you order will be explained to you if you're not familiar with some items
Go Omakase with Chef Yasuda
You won't regret it
This is the best sushi I've had, and yes, I've been to many restaurants in Japan as well
My guess is that the people who are giving low ratings aren't into the real thing
They california rollers
Without a doubt, one of the highest quality sushi restaurants in the city
Though expensive, the freshness of the fish is worlds above most of the other so-called top places in the city
The restaurant's design is certainly lovely, and we had just the most fantastic-but-not-obsequious service, several notches above many restaurants in the city
The prices were reasonable enough (we did not have time for omakase) although we agreed that if they want to serve such thinly-sliced fish on the sushi, it is best to cut down on the rice, too, so as not to unbalance the flavors
The fish selection was gourmet and the pieces were tender and fresh
Presentation was beautiful
Service was sublime; all the people working here were so nice and helpful
We'd definitely come back, but would not rank it among the 5 best we've ever had
but then again, we might just have been spoiled by LA's warm-rice sushi trend
After hearing much hype, we had probably some of the worst sushi ever here! The rolls were dry, mealy, bland, warm, and the fish was NOT fresh
The chirashi was ok, but it was all rice with minimal fish
We couldn't even finish it, it was so bad
More disturbing was the very high price we paid, which would not have been such an issue if the food was even mediocre, which it was not
Don't let the swanky atmosphere fool you, there's nothing special here in the food or preparation
Sushi Yasuda is the best sushi resturant I have been to so far (and I have been to a bunch)
I was impressed with their sushi selection
They had several different types of yellowtail, tuna, eel etc
(For eel lovers, I recommend the dark freshwater eel
It has an amazing soft texture that melts into your mouth and explodes with flavor
) The sushi was very fresh, of high quality and exquisite
Each piece (made me roll my eyes in pleasure) was very soft and tender with a subtle flavor, not an over powering one, which is sometimes found in some sushi
The service was excellent
The waiter was very attentative and helpful in explaining things for my first time experience
He even periodically replaced my green tea to ensure that I had a cup of hot tea throughout the whole meal
it's good
not just good, su--goin da yo!!
you just cannot get any better
Great food, excellent ambiance
Prices are fairly steep, but it's worth every penny
One of the best sushi experiences in the city
It comes at a price, but the quality and variety cannot be beat
Always go omakase with yasuda san
- you will not be disappointed
This place is not for the spicy tuna or california roll crowd
sushi, service, ambience doesn't get better than this
anyone who claims to be a sushi expert in manhattan (and there are many who do) is not qualified to make recommendations if this place is not mentioned or hasn't been visited
if you're still not convinced, then just walk by the place and see all of the distinguished japanese clietele dining there - they're no fools
Extremely high quality and large variety -- better than any other top place in nyc
Nothing strange or unusual though
Pieces weren't large (1
5 inches per piece)
Variety of standard sushi joint fishes was huge -- mackerel (5 types), eel (4 types), etc
Many deals on the menu
Chef's choice for 50 dollars (8 pieces and 1 roll) was fantastic
However, similarity of fishes (i had 2 types of yellowtail, and 2 types of white tuna), made some difficult to distinguish
Better ways to spend 50 bucks is probably to get a platter of 8 pieces and 1/2 a roll (20 bucks) -- this will give you a good solid dose of extremely high quality sushi, as well as some quantity
Then add 3 or 4 exotic pieces (high quality eel, very fatty tuna), and the totaly will be more like 35 dollars
Lastly, get the Toro roll
Sushi Yasuda has a small selection of sushi and rolls and it is very traditional in what it serves

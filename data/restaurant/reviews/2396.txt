We partied so hard and long we had no idea that it was after midnight and we were still going strong
We're planningto go back in the near future
One of my favorite places in Manhattan is the La Maganette Restaurant
I try to get there at least once a year for dinner
My children also love the food here
(they are married) They come into the city with a Limo to have a wonderful dinner with great service
My son just took his in-laws there for a special birthday dinner
Everyone loved the food
I just have just one complaint, I wish the restaurant was in Long Island!! I don't like to drive into manhattan
My wife and I have gone to this restaurant for 30 years and it is one of our very favorites
Fair prices, very good food, good portions, and a good head waiter, Guido
Reserve a table in his section which is just beyond the bar on the mail level
He only handles about four tables
I had dinner at La Maganette once
Their appetizers and main dishes were really excellent - I dined with 5 people and everyone loved it
The waiter has been there for 30 years, he was a little weird, but very nice
The place is nicely decorated, although it's borderline tacky
There are many tables with umbrellas outside, and it's usually packed during lunch
There were two things I disliked about this restaurant
First, there were so many elderly people there that I felt I was eating in some nursing home
It was a bit depressing
Second, the desserts were absolutely disgusting, the most awful I've ever had at a restaurant
Their tiramisu was served frozen
The cheescake was old and room temperature
Even the waiter agreed that their dessert is nasty, and that the chef is clueless when it comes to dessert
I can't comment on the authenticity of Lebanese food, so I won't even bother
What I will comment on is the value of the food
For what you get, this place is severely overpriced
For a place that charges ~$20 per plate, the food is only so-so
Moreover, the value isn't even reflected in high quality service or interesting decor
If Lebanese food had the cultural cachet to charge prices like this across the board (like French or Japanese food), I might be a bit more understanding
Unfortunately, I don't think it's quite there yet
I know something about middle eastern food
Lived there for three months
Was in Beruit two months ago
And I can say this place is great
A lebanese friend of mine took me there last night, and I was blown away
As good as any I've had in Beruit, or elsewhere in the middle east
The service was terrific
Granted, my buddy speaks Arabic so maybe that helped
I can't really comment on the service you'll receive
And I didn't pay, so I can't say anything about the value
All I did was eat, and the food was terrific
I am an Army vet that returned from the middle east about a year ago
I was craving for some Middle Eastern food one day and happened to pass by
The first shock I got was when I opened the menu and saw the prices
The second was when the food arrived
I understand I'm no longer in the middle east, but the portion to price ratio was a bit disappointing
I thought the hummus was so-so, kinda bland actually
For my main dish, I had the Kefta platter
It was only ok
As far as service goes, it was adequate
Overall, i would not recommend this place
The entrees aren't bad, but the food doesn't justify the price
If you're craving for good middle Eastern, just go down to the East Village
Since we were'nt all that hungry, we ordered a humous, babganoush and a falafel plate - all very tasty
But the service ruined the experience for us! The pita bread was hard and chewy, and when we asked the waiter for fresh bread he put his hands in the bread and claimed the bread is warm
When the bill finally arrived, the head waiter sternly told us that this time is okay, but next time you have to order more than 2 appitizers and a main course! No where on the menu did it mention a minimum order
This is a sorry excuse for a fine dining establishment
Do yourself a favor and order takeout
it's too bad that this restaurant is charging so much for the portions they serve
the food tasted good, but it was just obnoxious how much they charged considering the poor service and generic decor
they need to either lower their prices, or improve the quantity of food and quality of service
The food is great, a little pricey, great fixed menu for groups of four or more, which gives great value
The Scene This bi-level townhouse--a power-lunch lair--features two distinct environments: The ground floor is soft and elegant, with high-backed banquettes and nautical murals; upstairs is more masculine and woody
A ceremonious staff keeps all moving smoothly
The Food The restaurant has not lost a step in its transition from celebrity chef Rick Moonen (now at RM) to wunderkind Cornelius Gallagher, whose confident style is more elaborate than that of his predecessor, and most frequently, dead on-target
Ineffably sweet roasted Spanish shrimp ringed by rich turnip puree; a brick of Atlantic halibut under an almond crust and set in a pool of almond milk with pearl tapioca; and spectacular salmon roulade with a sauce of crushed olives and red wine
Desserts are equally stellar
The best seafood in NYC, bar none
The menu changes regularly, but I've always found something (usually several somethings!) that appeal
All of the dishes are expertly prepared, and I have yet to be disappointed with a meal
The desserts aren't quite as good as the rest of the food, but they aren't bad either
The service is generally attentive without being intrusive, and the ambiance is calm and serene without being boring
My boyfriend brought me to Oceana for Valentine's Day and I was thoroughly impressed
Our six-course prix fixe dinner was delightful
Admist the soft drone of conversation we were served each small but perfectly-prepared course in a timely fashion
The seafood chowder was unbelievable as was the dessert plate which featured a plethera of sweet treats
We were served two kinds of fish, both fresh, light, perfectly balanced in flavor
It was wonderful to sit down to a dinner so thoughtfully orchestrated - each course was different, offered an original palette of flavor, and a pleasant surprise
We dined on the main floor and found the atmosphere to be calmingly quiet (perfect for conversation) and strangely relaxing as well
Although the meal came with a high price tag it was an experience that will stay in my memory!
Went here for Valentine's Day
The restaurant is nicely decorated, not overderdone
We were seated before our reservation time, and the staff was very nice
I sat to find red wine stains on my napkin and bread plate
Not what you'd expect from such a place
The food was good, nothing over the top
And a dinner for 2 was over $300, in my opinion not worth it at all
Many other fine restaurants in NYC with better food for less money
I went to Oceana for a business dinner with other 5 people
It turned out to be a huge disappointment both for the puzzling experimental food and the unexpectedly inadequate service
Food was completely disappointing
Despite the undisputed quality of raw materials and my liking of fusion cuisine, most of the chef's daring combinations tasted like freaks, born of a failed experiment
My tartare of fish was overwhelmed by wasabi and other spices and the sea bass was very disappointing, with unbalanced additions of oriental spices
My negative experience was unforunately shared by most of my colleagues, with one exception: a guy who ordered a plain beef fillet
Service was disappointing too with staff behaving rudely and incapable of smiling at customers
Finally the price (a quite expensive $115 each) was completely out of touch with the reality of the food we had
Unfortunately this is definitely a NO GO
The waiters here were exactly what I expect from a nice restaurant: very quiet, not intrusive, but prompt in filling up our water glasses, taking away our plates, etc

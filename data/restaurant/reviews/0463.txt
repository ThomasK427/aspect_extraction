Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices
Maybe I'm wrong to compare this place to places in Chinatown because it's decorated better and situated in Brooklyn, but I can't help it!!! I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area
I'm sorry, but as far as I know, no one puts sesame oil in a dipping sauce for pork juicy buns
It's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger
I have never seen, not even in Shanghai, a place serving dumplings with dipping sauce made with the combination of sesame oil, soy sauce, black vinegar, and chili oil
Yuk!!!
I went to M to hear some music in the den (basement) one night
I had never been to the place and hadn't even heard about it but went to see some musicians I like
My friends and I decided to eat upstairs first and what a great call that was
I have been back on a near weekly basis since
You will not find better vegetable dumplings anywhere
The decor is warm and inviting, there's almost always good music playing in the dining area, and the service is always pleasant
If the food doesn't keep you coming back, you'll return for May's smile and warm welcome
In Short Brooklynites line up out the door of this Fulton Ferry Fire Boat House, then take their cups and cones out on the pier for a glimpse of the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan skyline and sparkling East River
Popular choices from the small menu of tried-and-true flavors include delicious butter pecan and refreshing peaches and cream
Chocolate is subtle and not overly sweet; vanilla is best topped with hot fudge
The vanilla and coffee flavors are excellent, the strawberry is pretty good, but the peach flavor is disappointingly bland (you can't taste the peach)
I don't get it
The ice cream's not bad, but there's nothing special about it
It couldn't kill them to offer a new flavor every now and then, and what kind of ice cream shop doesb't offer samples?!
This place is alright
The chocolate was good, but the peaches and cream and strawberry were basically basic grocery store ice cream
They also don't give samples, which is absurd
what ice cream place doesn't give samples
Don't make a special trip to go here, I'm telling you
Go somewhere else
Went for ice cream after walking across the brooklyn bridge and eating at grimaldi's
great way to end the day, eating ice cream overlooking the water! the butter pecan was amazing and the chocolate chocolate chunk was good too! worth the wait!
I had the peaches in cream, and my wife had the chocolate
It was fine - not bad, but nothing to write home about
Not worth waiting in the line
The only reason that I'd recommend stopping in is if you happen to have just emerged from Grimaldi's up the road and have a dessert fix, or to grab a snack as you take in the gorgeous view of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge
one of the best vanilla icecream i ever had
not too sweet, just right
I usually don't eat ice cream because it's not worth the calories or fat grams, but this stuff is entirely worth it
I don't know what they put in it, but it's creamy, smooth, perfectly flavored, simple, clean, fresh--everything you want dessert to taste like
For just a little more than it's bastard low fat copy (Tasti DLite), you can get heaven in a cone
Great location, friendly staff, and worth the long lines even after waiting all night to have pizza at nearby Grimaldi's
There are a handful of places in NYC that serve such amazing ice cream and gelato that you won't mind spending a ridiculous $3
00 for a single scoop
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM! Their ice cream is good, but not worth as much as they charge, especially since they only have a few uninspired flavors to choose from and their store is pretty inconveniently located
Worst of all, they won't give you any sample tastes! What arrogance!
I traveled all the way to Brooklyn from Staten Island
I was no impressed by the small scoops for the price I paid
This guy who served me was a bit on the rude side
I expected more from the hype it has recieved
We had lunch at Grimaldi's just up the street and had to try some of the ice cream
The homemade vanilla was awesome, even in 30 degree weather! Great views also
A true gem, with a great view and friendly service considering the line was out the door on the hottest day of the year! Worth the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge
The Ice Cream is quite tasty
I went with a group of about 8 friends on a Sunday evening in March, so it wasn't very crowded, it's in a cute little historic building and there scenery outside is compelling (South Street Seaport is across the water) The girl behind the counter seemed a bit impatient
But we ignored her 'tude and had a great time!
what a great view of the city
the ice cream was good
I can imagine that when the summer comes this place must be mobbed
I was there in Feb
and there was a line
well worth the trip in from the island
you have Jacques Torres around the corner Grimaldi's up the block, And Buddy's not to far away also
all that and view of the Brooklyn bridge
What else do you need?
I had their chocolate and vanilla ice cream and it was amazing
They definitely have the best vanilla ever
A little bit of a line, but well worth it
After you get your ice cream you can take a walk by the water and look at the amazing view
I highly suggest this outing to anyone who loves ice cream
I'm not sure what there is to not like about this place
The building is charming, the staff friendly and ready to please, you put whatever music you want to hear on the record player, the ice cream is amazing, and the view is top notch! Everything about it is warm and inviting
except the ice cream, that's cold and inviting
I HIGHLY recommend the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory! If you take your date there in the summer and sit out by the river, I GUARANTEE you'll get kisses! Even the bathrooms are clean and nice
This is Ice Cream by the way, not Gelato
That misunderstanding is the only reason I can think of to justify the negative reviews
Oh, and it's REALLY good after Grimalde's Pizza (just up the street)
You'd think an ice cream place in the dead of winter would be happy to have you
But other than a cursory hello- the service sucked
Maybe it was contagious- but I've never seen so many UNHAPPY faces in an ice cream place!!And the shakes were way too milky
for all those on weight watchers its worth every delious point
the best ice cream we ever had
My friend and I were, fortunately, early for a barge music event in the area on a warm day and stopped in for a cone
Wow! The selection of flavors was excellent and, upon tasing the strawberry cone that I chose, I promptly gave up my membership in the Hagen Daz is the best ice cream ever club
I would make a special trip out to Brooklyn from Manhattan any day to experience this wonderful taste sensation
The ice cream is fine (nothing special) - but pour some of the homemade hot fudge on top and sprinkle the view of Manhattan right out the front door and you've got a wonderful dessert treat
Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory has a great location since it is located under the Bklyn
Bridge on a newly renovated pier w/a view of the beautiful NYC skyline
Cool off w/a cone, sundae or shake and take in the even cooler view
Went all the way to Brooklyn to try this its runny and over creamy - really its just like baskin robins
Just hyppe to try and get thta Stretch of 5th Avenue trendy!! Now with so many Italians in this city you'd expect the ice cream to taste better
and yes I am italian from Rome so I know!!!
This place cranks out some creamy and delicious ice cream
They flavors are pretty limited, but classics
Try the coffee
The only thing they do need to improve on is the long line waiting to be served
The Scene A small neon sign leads the way to this outpost of Ciao Bella's Mott Steet factory
Without seating options inside, customers either order and go, or take seats around the potted tree outside on the sidewalk
On sultry summer nights, the high-end ice cream shop pulls in families from Chintown and Little Italy, as well as sleeksters post-spree or pre-bar
The Food Scoops in a rich palette of flavors double as fashion accessories
Dense raspberry, mango and grapefruit sorbets are saturated with fruit, while ice cream flavors such as green tea and malted milk ball hit their notes perfectly
The Caribbean shake (made with passion fruit sorbet and vanilla ice cream) is just one standout among a host of frappes, floats and other drinks, including hot chocolate in the winter
I only come here for pistachio gelato b/c it's the closest to the best gelato offered in Florence, Italy
rich, smooth, full pistachio flavor

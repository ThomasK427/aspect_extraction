I had the butternut squash ravioli and was surprised at the subtle and delicious combination of flavors
I've had the dish at other restaurants but this was the best
My companions' meals were also very good, including my son's who ordered from the children's menu and finished with a truly scrumptious ice cream sundae
The restaurant has a simple brasserie decor, is low-lit and is not loud at all so you can actually have a conversation while dining
My only criticism is that it is listed as American, while it is much more French
Steak au poivre with steak frites is clearly French
Anyways, the food is fabulous, and they have an excellent wine list, and well as a great selectio nof beers
I went to Village with a large group of people, not expecting much
However, four bottles of wine and an unforgettable seared tuna later, I would almost promise to come back
Our server was humorous, chatty, and had a great sense of humor
There was not a morsel of food left on anyone's plate
And even the desserts were delicious
Although the restaurant is a bit too big to be considered cozy, it does have a nice, homey feel to it
I would definitely recommend Village--especially with a big group!
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts
The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world! We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
I think the Village has a nice space and I heard many good reviews about this restaurant at the Village
However, the food was so-so (not enough favor), overpriced and the biggest disappointment was the service, pretty horrible in my opinion
I started coming here a few months ago because it's close to home
At first it was the great burgers, but then it became something more
It's a rare West Village place that is there for the people that live in the hood, rather than just there to make money off of the people in the hood
(I've met the owner, Stephan Lyle and he does live in Tribeca
) The customers and the staff all seem to believe in this place
The food is good, not amazing
But it is definately never bad and always accomadating
The staff is friendly (the reason I'm writing this!) and versed in the menu
It's a great hangout, that also offers a little bit more when you want it, but never makes you feel like you have to have it
Nice decor
Service was so-so
(Sometimes I wish mgmt would make the water boys into waiters, they always care more!) Need more choices on the menu
Steak was fairly good
I could see this place appealing to tourists
The food here was pretty good - the menu was varied enough that no one had any trouble finding something they liked
That said, the portions were pretty small while the prices were a little steep
Service was ok, but the food runners kept bringing the wrong dishes to the wrong seats and not seeming to understand that they had screwed up the table arrangement
I do not agree with the previous couple of reviewers who had such a great time - because my wife and I were quite disappointed by the food and service
My tuna tatare was laden with salt and soy sauce - tasted like cheap chinese instead of great fish
My chicken was dry and the waitstaff was unattentive
Nice place for a drink, but that's about it
this west village locale, looks like a place to be seen, fancy bar, bistro style and one would expect the food to be quite average
Au contraire! excellent food, fresh fish for those fish lovers, unique salads, appetizers and great desserts! definitely a treat!
the secret is finally out this is where greenwich village comes to eat
Stephen Lyle formely of The Odeon in tribeca has once again sucked us into his living room, help!, i may never leave
Every night he offers us a tour of exceptionaly fresh food cooked to perfection from his favorite spots around the world
This is the man who invented comfort food
P

A little secret; Every thursday night Stephen and some of his cronies throw a great party!! dj, great food, beautiful neighborhood people and it rocks till well past 4 am!!!
Went to The Village for dinner the other night and had the most incredible steak! I honestly cannot remember the last time I had one that tender and juicy
The oysters were superb
no sand at all, and if I had enough of an appetite left, I'm sure the desserts would have been awesome too! I highly recommend you give this great restaurant a try
Trust me, you'll go back!
I can't tell you how many times I have eaten here and I plan on coming back again and again
I have never had a meal I didn't enjoy and I have highly recommended most everything to my friends and fellow diners
The lamb, tuna, the mussels (a meal in themselves) and most importantly, the bread, are highlights


and the wine list satisfies most every tastebud and wallet
And don't forget about brunch


Jared makes a killer Bloody Mary and Jeffrey's Apple Martini's can't be beat
Kudos to Steve and Alex for a wondering dining experience
I love Village! It's the perfect place for an upscale casual dinner-- the menu ranges from delicious hamburgers to excellent fish
Service is relaxed but attentive, and the atmosphere is always pleasant
Great brunch on weekends too!
The Scene Along with Diner and Miss Williamsburg, this Southern-tinged hangout completes the neighborhood trio of revived diner eateries
Big, bright windows along the booths offer a view of Wythe Avenue and its stable of motorcycles, while an expansive garden peeks out through trees and flowers
The music ranges from blues and R come nighttime, the deco stainless steel blazes with sexy red gleams
The Food This dressed-up diner menu begins with fun starters, like shareable Macaroni and Many Cheeses
The sirloin cheeseburger is one of the city's top contenders
On a brunch visit, go for the sunnyside eggs with a genius combo of Serrano ham and cheddar grits; late night, the apple tart and cinnamon ice cream--complemented with a Grahams Six Grapes port--warms the soul
All the items on the menu (which changes every season) are excellent
The service is generally good, though some waiters can be aloof, and at times the music can be downright out there
but the excellent food makes up for it
Good Food / Nice Atmosphere / Great Location / Rude Slow Waitstaff with attitude
What could have been a wonderful meal (the food was overall delicious and well prepared) was completely ruined by the loud, extremely heavy metal music blaring from the stereo
We asked the waitress very nicely to please change the playlist to something more appropriate for dinner, she chuckled to herself and said sure but never changed it
We asked her again when she came to our table and she said sorry, that is what we play here
There were hardly any other customers there
So, we left her a tip to match her snotty attitude
Then she loudly told the chef what we left her as if she expected to get tipped simply because she exists
Great food, but get it to go! And stay away from Dee Dee the Wannabe Waitress
After seeing this chic diner in the film version of Angels in America, I hunted it down on my bicycle, using the Williamsburg Bridge for triangulation
That night, my girlfriend and I enjoyed an amazing meal, complete with prompt seating and friendly service
Unfortunately, return trips to Relish have been far less satisfactory than the first
This is odd
The Macaroni and Many Cheeses has always been crispy on top and creamy inside, the Mixed Greens crisp and flavorful with a light vinaigrette, and the specials intriguing
In short, most menu items are tasty and adventurous, while staying true to their warped diner roots
But my last three visits have been marred by both my high expectations and their rude service
My recommendation is: go once on a hot evening, sit in the garden, enjoy the cocktails, order several items, take pictures, and never go back
I visited Relish for Sunday brunch this weekend
I was pretty happy with my omlette, and my date's prociutto and poached egg benedict was delicious
I had to steal more than a few bites! However, service was on the slow side (my glass of water was never refilled) and I would have been happier with the food if it had been hot when it was brought to the table, instead of just above room temperature
Those complaints aside, I really enjoyed my meal, and I'll definitely be back
Maybe I'll stop in for dinner next time
With all the great places to eat in Williamsburg don't waste your time on this overrated tin can
The food was average, the decor is cool but the service was overly pretentious!!! They need to round up all the wannabes that work there, attach a big truck to this trailer and hall these credit card hipsters out of the neighboorhood!
I've had drinks here a few times, but tonight I finally tried the food

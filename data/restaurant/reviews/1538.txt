Go there once, you may not know quite what to think of the environment, but a return visit finds you at home, welcome and appreciated
The coffee and desserts are impossible to avoid, and the staff is generally friendly and warm, even if at times you feel like you're an extra on a reality tv set
The realness of the staff may be off putting to those who expect waitstaff to behave like robots, I find it adds to the experience
It's a great place to go and relax, write, have a conversation, and a rare little spot of charm in a neighborhood rapidly losing it's own
Go a couple of times and you'll be hooked!
I have my morning breakfast everday at the Antique
I really like the parisian atmosphere right in the heart of NY
The boys there are great and very pleasant
I have never had any problems, and i def recommend
If you in the neighborhood, it is a place that you have to stop by
In an area seriously lacking for open space, this cafe is a welcome breath of fresh air
One can only imagine what a pleasure it is to stumble upon this comfortable place on a hot, muggy city summer day
Although the food is nothing spectacular but typical cafe fare (soups, salads, sandwiches, hot entrees), it is the service and atmosphere that set it apart from the rest in the neighborhood
Casual tables under umbrellas host locals, neighborhood types, where everyone seems to know everyone else, and even the servers know almost all by name
Atmosphere is fun and relaxed, while service is friendly, pleasant and leisurely, more like a family backyard party than rushed, impersonal restaurant service
This is the perfect place to make you relax and forget that horrible work day
The only danger is that you may not want to head back to work after having lunch here
i have never been in a more non-new york atmosphere in new york
i felt like i could be in europe
the staff was very sweet to me, my kids and my dog, which is also very un new york
while i did have to wait for my meal, it was TOTALLY delicious, well presented and good value for money
I have been back for several dinners and lunchs and especially like the terrace when weather permits
I want to like this place
I *really* do
It's got a cozy, pleasant atmosphere, great sandwiches and desserts, and offers all the appeal of being one of those This little out-of-the-way-place-I-know places
However, it suffers--greatly--from lackluster staff who evidece little to no food service experience
For example, on a recent visit I was charged a dollar more than the list price for my drink
When I asked about it, One of the staff, in a reprimanding tone, said that the prices listed were for take-out only, and that I had been charged dine in prices for dine in serivce
(Note: Price variations were listed nowhere--and I had asked for a to-go drink, deciding--after paying--to sit at a no-service counter until my drink cooled off
I guess they must hire psychics
)  Other visits have yielded similar results: slow service, distracted staff, lots of attitude
I won't be going back
It's hard to find good coffee in this city, but Antique has one of the best cups I've tasted
Nice quiet spot in the shadows of Penn Station, a real gem
I absolutely loved the brownies from Antique Cafe, (on 27th btwn 7thand 8th) I even got my co-workers addicted
One day I popped in and I bought 2 brownies at 2
95 each but when I returned to work and took a bite I was disappointed because they tasted different they were hard and dry
I called and spoke to the Manager who was more than apologetic and offered to give me credit or different brownies
I went back to Antique Cafe the following day and at first everyone was friendly until I complained about the brownies
I told them I didn't even want my money back just a credit (because I had trust in the brownies and just thought it was a bad batch), but they gave me such an attitude!!! I was so disappointed, I wish the brownies weren't so good because then I wouldn't return in the future
Dropped in for a quick bite with a friend -- like the previous reviewer it took more than 15 minutes for any kind of service at all (including getting water) and then another 45 minutes to get a burger (which admittedly was good)
If you're not in a hurry and like sitting around outside in the plaza it can be a good experience
If you're in the least bit conscious of time, you'll be gnashing your teeth and starving before your food comes
The manager again explained he was short staffed -- but our visit was several months after the previous reviewer's, so if it was a problem why hadn't it been addressed?
April 10, four entered 1:15, 1:30 seated, 2pm to receive service
Questioned waiter several times
Order taken, yet another fifteen min before coffee and mimosas were served
Food arrived hour later, terrible, cold, rubbery eggs lacking flavor
Asked for condiments several times, finally received catsup yet no butter, jam to compliment plain cold toast
We had to plead several times for check so we could exit
I spoke with manager He explained, They were short handed not even a sorry! I understand, things happen, but if a manager/owner is aware of that situation why on earth does he continue to seat, attempt to serve people when he already knows that he will be offering unsatisfactory service??? I would recommend that you avoid the Antique Caf (and especially if they look crowded however with the terrible service, bad food, and lack of interest, I doubt they will be crowded long
Somewhat pricey though the interior atmosphere is airily pleasant and it does have a lovely outdoor dining area situated not on the sidewalk but on a wide concourse that cuts across the entire block from 26th to 27th Street
So, you don't have to watch hurried pedestrians and cars zipping by front of you
Makes lunch much less stressful
Try the Fizzy Lizzy pineapple gourmet soda, which I haven't found anywhere else in this city
It is great
stumbled upon this tiny cafe by mistake to find a beautiful menu, charming staff, and delightful atmosphere
The perfect spot to meet a friend for a light lunch
(Lunch for two: about $20
) Try the gorgonzola and cucumber sandwhich
On sunny days the outdoor seating is the best in the neighbothood
The Scene On the far eastern edge of Grand Street lies Kossar's Bialystoker Kuchen Bakery-- Kossar's as it's commonly known--a legendary operation that dates back to 1927
Kossar's is strictly a to-go operation, but don't be surprised if you wind up lingering to watch the flour-covered bakers go about the endless work of shuttling giant wooden trays of dough in and out of the oven
The Food The bialys at Kossar's are nothing short of a baking marvel
The warm bialy experience is one of those quintessential culinary experiences that every New Yorker should enjoy at least once
The first taste sensations are textural--of lightness, softness and an airy center--and eventually give way to a stronger current of dark and charry taste
Impossibly sweet bits of onion sprinkled on top linger to the finish
The bagels and bialys are fabulous
Sometimes annoying that it's closed on Saturdays, and that the space seems kind of grungy, but if you can score one of the benches outside it's nice to eat outside the shop
They sell Tuv Taam cream cheese too!
After several visits to Manhattan, I finally was fortunate enough to experience the pleasure of Kossar's bialy's
Although they are in the bagel family, these tasty dough based morsels have a depression in the middle filled onion, garlic or poppy seeds
Kossar's is the last bialy baker in Manhattan and worth the logisitcs of finding
This is Old World baking at it's best originating from Bialystok Poland
The bakery harkens back to Old Manhattan
Please be sure to visit this historic venue before they lose their lease and it's taken over by the upteenth yuppie bar
Tasty, soft, Garlicky, oniony, Warm oh so delightful
A real treat
Keep them in your freezer
I come all the way here from Brooklyn, taking 2 trains just to come here to get the bagels and bialys this place has
I usually buy a dozen at a time and finish them in 3 or 4 days (and I'm a tiny person, weighing only 95lbs)
I've been buying from Kossar's since I was a little girl
My favorite is their plain bialys
I take them home and when I am ready to eat them, I pop them in the microwave for 20 seconds and I indulge in their heavenly goodness
The bagels are a perfect texture and softness and stays soft for days
I take all my friends here and they all love it too
They make the best bialys, hand made as always
Its a shame though, traffic and tourism have been down since 9/11 and I fear it may force changes
Go there
These are positively the best bagels I have ever had
Texture, taste, size are the way bagels are supposed to be
It's a nuisance to get the lower east side bakery, though the bagels are a great value
My mother tells me that Kossar's has the most authentic bialy still made, and though they may have changed hands, the baked goods -- bialys, sesame sticks, bagels and nameless rounds of dough covered in poppyseeds -- are delectable enough for me
Traipsing out east, and east, and further east is a small price to pay for these delicious morsels, and speaking of small prices, you won't believe how economical getting your bialy fix can be
I've found the service uniformly helpful, though I admit one server did laugh when I justified buying 3 dozen by telling her twelve were for mom
In Short In 1910, a struggling young Bulgarian rabbi by the name of Yonah Schimmel opened this humble knish shop
Nearly a century later, his family still turns out some of the city's most beloved baked goods
The soft ball-sized knishes, filled with everything from potato to cheese-and-fruit mixtures, are all-natural, hand-shaped, and baked in old-fashioned brick ovens
Most get theirs to go, but there are a few tables and chairs for sampling the simple deli fare

I would not go unless you are a steak fanatic
The best porterhouse steak in NYC - BARNONE! Bring a friend along to enjoy the huge portions
Other than its impossible reservation (no matter how many months you call in advance, the only available time slots for dinner on a Saturday are always 4:45 or 9:45), Peter Luger is worth the drive over to Brooklyn
Your best bet is to just show up without making a reservation though it is not recommended if you have a party of 5 or more people
Truly an exquisite dining experience
My godfather brought me here on a visit, and I almost didn't leave NYC after eating! The rolls are heavenly, the beefsteak tomato and onion salad with the Peter Luger's steak sauce is an odd but delicious combination, and the gigantic steaks were melt-in-your-mouth tender
The drinks were superb, and I didn't taste a single thing that wasn't spectacular
The chocolate medallions are the best part!
I don't get it and I wasn't impressed
Obnoxious service isn't cute
Our waiter sat and ate a steak with his back to us when we wanted to order a second bottle of wine
Best quality steak in NY
Not the easiest place to get to,but you still have to go
Awesome onion rolls that don't need butter
You feel a sense of history as soon as you walk in
Bar pours very stiff cocktails so be careful drinking before dinner
Don't ask for menu,steak is what you will have,along with great creamed spinach
Very expensive,but a must dinner! Bring a lot of cash,no credit
No doubt in my mind or in the mind of any steak lover, this IS this place to go for steaks!!  I prefer mine without the butter added and I let the waiter know that
While you're telling the waiter what to do, make sure you let him know to bring you the hashed browns and plain spinach
altho my better half prefers the cream spinach
AND DO NOT FORGET TO ORDER A SLICE OR TWO OF THE BACON AS A PREAPPETIZER WITH YOUR DRINK
ENJOY!!! ED
GREAT MEAT
LOVE THE CREAMED SPINACH
WISH THEY OPENED UP A LOCATION OUT ON THE ISLAND
I never liked steak before having one at Peter Luger's in Brooklyn
People would say Melts in your mouth like butter
Didn't believe this
Peter Luger's Steak Melts in your mouth like butter
The food is great
but the place is a bit too small and the pricing is to high
I know cows live in barns but I certainly would rather not dine in one
Both locations in NY appear to be decorated by an old farm hand
They know they have great food so I guess the thought is foget what the places looks like and don't expect a polite waiter either
Rude and obnoxious is the theme here
It is a great steak though
P
S
Bring cash unless you have a Peter Lugar charge card
No other Charge cards are accepted
I think peter lugar has the best steak, potatoes,and dessert
Was terribly disappointed
Tables packed too close together; food average; service slow; waiter had an attitude problem
Cleaniness of establishment left a lot to be desired
Location in a less than desirable neighborhood
Very limited steak selection, could/should have been much more tender! Great side dishes! Old time charm
Ala carte pricing up there
Didn't take credit cards
Customer has to make an effort on many levels
(location,bring cash
) The steak was the least impressive part of my meal
The wait and bar staff were great
Great steaks, good sauce, but the place is as romantic as a vampire on your neck!  Why can't we pay with credit card?
First of all, the Brooklyn location is better then the Great Neck one
The steaks are simply the reason to come here
You probably can not find a better steak in all 5 boroughs of New York City
The service is terrible and the waiters are so rude you want to punch them in the face
They were the most uncourteous of people and go out of their way to make your visit as unpleasant as possible
Allow the steak to subdue the evening
I recommend this place for a large group, not a date
Peter Lugers is an excellent steak house, but I'll take Sparks or Smith Wollensky over Lugers any day
Why travel to Brooklyn when you've got plenty of great chioces for steak houses in Manhattan?
This place was one of my highlights while visiting new york
I had both rare and medium rare steak and they were prepared to perfection
The excellent bacon, cold beer, and loud/fun crowd couldn't even distract me from enjoying the steak
If you want it your way, right away, Peter Luger's is not your place (Try Ruth Chris or Burger King)
However, if you want magificent porterhouse steaks done to prefection, your decision starts and ends at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge
When you order, toe the line - order steak for the # in your party (Don't overcook it, Prince Charles!), tomato onion salad and bacon are a must
Know what you are doing and don't upset the famously gruff staff and you will be treated like a king
Had a business dinner there once, and that was more than enough
Service was sporatic, rude and messy
Since when did it become a custom to have the waiters serve your food the way they feel it should be served, regardless of your own personal taste
I was always under the assumption that the customer knows best
Paid top dollar for a plate of blood
Everyone said that Peter Luger's was the best steak in the country
Guess what??? IT IS!!!! The two times I have eaten at Peter's, the service and food have been second to none
I recommend ordering any dessert with their homemade Schlag which is whipped cream
This place is a little pricey but still worth every penny
For those of you who moan and groan, it's great steak
Forget the atmosphere and the lack of romance
If it's atmosphere you want go to the River Cafe under the bridges and pay an arm and a leg for hospital-type food
Luger's is about great food, and that's it
You don't need a reservation like most people say, and for those of you who moan about no credit cards, those are the people that don't have two nickels to rub together
This place didn't stay in business since 1887 because people like credit cards
Cash seems to work just fine
I have been to Peter Luger's a number of times
I go for the food!This is The Penultimate Steak House!!For a side,I always order the beefsteak tomatoes layered with red onions al a vinegraite!!!The lyonnaise potatoes are to die for!!!
A great steak house can not have beauty and glitz, rustic, homey with the best meat and the best side dishes
- Thats Peter Luger's!
have been eating there for over 30 years, my father-in-law holds peter luger credit card oo2
the best steaks around and i've eaten alot of steak
In a word, the food is the best i have ever tasted
That includes some of the best steak houses in Kanas and Las Vegas
the steak was just mouth watering and it was so tender
There is no discussion, this is the finest steak anyone can find in the world
It is by far the best steak ever
Only thing that can compare to the steaks at Peter Luger's is Argentina steakhouses in Argentina
The steaks we had were cooked to perfection
It also seem like a place where many people for birthday celebrations

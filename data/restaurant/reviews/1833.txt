Terriffic wine list with a small selection of fabulous wines; outstanding appatizer menu; incredible entres; and delicious desserts
all with service that is incredibly friendly and not snooty in the least
Go here, go here, go here
If you're with friends looking for an incredible meal or if you're with your loved one and looking for romance
Go here
If you're a conservative who loves chain restaurants, please don't come to NYC
go to Atlanta or some crap city like that
The place is louder and less intimate than it was years ago
Don't get me wrong
It's a good place for a dinner date or to catch up with someone you haven't seen in over six months
The entrees (grilled salmon and pork loin) are tasty and the service was spot on
I can't recommend one dish over the other
What I do recommend is you blow through dinner as fast as possible to get to the chocolate truffle tart on the dessert menu! The combination of the chocolate and pistachio ice cream brought a tear to my eye
Absolute bliss!
If this is New York's most romantic restaurant, they are in trouble
The food was average at best
The lamb was salty and they didn't have a strong wine list that a 4 star restaurant should have
After spending over 150 dollars for a three course meal, I know now that I can get better dinners in most other cities
Try L'Ecole restaurant for a better meal and a more romantic atmosphere which is easier on your wallet
I had the striped bass with 2 scallops and it was delicious
However, it was too small for its price
The place was too small too
We were very excited to dine here, however after we entered the restaurant it wasn't as impressive as others have written here
Decorations were mediocre
Nothing really fancy
The bar was in the middle of the room, fireplace had candles inside
Everything here was small
The only big thing was our check
the menu has no price list
So it's a little confusing when you receive your bill
It was nice to try this place as it had high rating and excellent editorial, nonetheless, i will not be back
I dont know why no one ever remembers Savoy when making plans with friends! It is a great place to relax and unwind to the tune of wine and good food
Slightly pricey, but totally reliable
Good background music doesn't drown you out and noise level is buzz as well
Strongly recommend, very cozy and fun - good combo!
The dinner tonight at Savoy I had with close friends ranks high on my list of restaurants
The space was intimate and charming
While I did like the food (the duck sausage was superb, as was the catalan steak, and sephardic chicken), the service is to be commended and lauded
Not once were we rushed through dinner
All courses were perfectly paced, such that we were able to enjoy our traditional holiday season dinner in a leisurely three hours)
Our server (who was quirky and charming) was attentive to detail and brought us a free dessert when he noticed one of the desserts wasn't well liked
I aim to be a returning patron
Went for our anniversary 2 weeks ago
Not as romantic as the ratings state
I had the prix fixe dinner for $60
Everything was overstated and written by professional copywriters
The shrimp appetizer was 1, yes 1 shrimp
The soup was about 1/3 cup
The beef was extremely fatty
The dessert, I must admit was the highlight of the meal
Husband had the chicken and was underwhelmed
I would not go back, especially at a price tag of $100(+) for 2
Service was also lack-luster
They're trained to sell the menu but not the food
Very warm ambiance
Great service
Fresh, savory food
Menu changes weekly!
A friend took me here for my birthday
The waitress was excellent and took great care of us
We shared a bunch of appetizers and they were fantastic
Interesting wines by the glass too
The entree was good but did not compare to the apps
We sat there for nearly 4 hours and never felt rushed
That made the high prices more palatable
I would only go again for a special occasion and when I need to relax and have privacy
Newly renovated, the upstairs now houses more tables, and a warm, homey atmosphere - if your home were decorated with the utmost of taste and style
The food is fantastic
The lamb chops made me melt - their lamb and pork is always fantastic, and the pastry chef - Amy - is a wonder
Super-romantic, or a great place to sit and savor food and good conversation with friends
This place has a real potential to be wonderful but it totally fell short of our expectations
We went for Valentine's Day expecting a warm, romantic environment - NOT! The service was terrible - our waitress didn't even say Hi - she just came over and asked us Are you ready to order, never checked in on us to see how were doing, never smiled
And the upstairs dining area is so cute, but it is packed with so many tables it takes the romance out of the place
The food and wine list were good but this place is not all of that
If you feel like splurging once in a while, don't do it here
Eventually tried this place
Was impressed with the decor
Service was good and so was food, but not great
Over-priced for what it was
This restaurant was fabulous, between the service being kind and courteous, to the food tasting fresh and delicious
An unfamiliar wine menu ended up having a magnificent Chianti that worked well with our food
The atmosphere is warm and cozy, especially since we were in the corner by the fireplace
Overall I would recommend, just no scallops as it is 10$ for two
That is there are just two scallops in the dish! Try the braised duck gnocchi, OUTSTANDING!
Savoy's recent remodeling has left the cozy upstairs just cold! While there's lots more space for more tables and bright lights, they seem to have lost their chef somewhere
The food was SO salty and that's all you can say for it, except for expensive
Too bad it's not what it used to be
The food, the service, the ambiance
it's all incredible
I've yet to find anything to beat the Savoy
Creative dishes you couldn't begin to imagine (rutabaga ravioli, anyone?), and then crave forever after
I don't understand all the negative reviews for this restaurant
My wife and I went for a special occasion and had a wonderful time
The food was excelent, the staff prompt and unobtrusive, and the whole place was just very nice
I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a romantic dinner for two
Excellent
Bravo Savoy!
I had the misfortune of taking my new husband to Savoy for his birthday dinner last week
He tried the market menu, which included an over-minted ravioli appetizer and plain broiled chicken
My lamb, which I was told by the waitress was only served medium rare, was room temp, bland, and chewy

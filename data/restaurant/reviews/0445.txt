The restaurant is an excellent example of what makes New York the dining capital of the world
I chose the Black Duck as the venue for a romantic meal with new special lady in my life
I'm very glad I did!
The Black Duck was a tremendous surprise
The food was outstanding and the service was tops
My wife and I purposely tried varying dishes and all were prepared artistically and with a flare your palate will not soon forget
This place is a treasure, but keep it quiet so my table will always be available
I would highly recommend this wonderful restaurant! The food is not your ordinary meat potatoes
The dishes are artistically created with a flavor that is truly extraordinary and pleasing to the palate
The ambiance is serene and relaxing
I can't wait to go back and have recommended this delightful place to all my friends and colleagues!
Tired of the ridiculous lines at Houston's, Les Halles, and Dos Caminos? Anthony Bourdain may not work here, but the food is a definate cut above! Try the espresso rubbed filet mignon - it's a generous portion, done to perfection, and the espresso butter topping is sublime
I've tried over half the menu and each time my meal has been memorable
Even the desserts deserve a standing O
With an atmosphere that is is relaxing and spacious and a staff that is friendly and inviting - this place is a real find
Bravo!
The Black Duck, hidden in the Park South Hotel, is great
The food was fresh and well-prepared, although the portion sizes were rather small (especially for the money)
While the theme is nautical, the decor is tastefully done, comfortable and I dare say, romantic
Tables were far enough away from each other to ensure solitary dining, andoOn weekends they have live music
If you can, try to snag a booth near the back
Service was attentive and friendly, whether the hostess, waitstaff or bartenders
The Black Duck is a great date place, whether going for dinner or just for a drink at their huge, antique-ish bar
One of the best meals I have had in New York
The duck confit appetizer is incredible and I usually do not like duck
Brined pork chop entree was even tastier
Strange that there are so few customers
Tucked away cutely beneath the Park South Hotel on 28th street, you will surely miss it if you don't look closely
It is a superb, laid back place with fantastic food, attentive service, and a nice feel
The 1 chicken entree was superb, and the blackened mahi mahi was quite tasty
This place is a real find - I hope it stays open!
The Scene Danny Meyer's sprawling, wood-trimmed barbecue joint, with its oversized booths, showpiece bar and late-night jazz club in the basement, is a hot spot for casual work lunches and fun nights on the town
Crowds pour in, and service is friendly and knowledgeable
The Food The moderately priced menu features upscale comfort food, but only enough to showcase the high-quality ingredients and interesting pairings
The food is fun and unfussy, as creamy deviled eggs and hush puppies with jalapeno-marmalade prove
Appetizers, like plump "barbecued" mussels spiced with cubes of smoked pork and chilies, and juicy game sausages with pickled jalapenos, are Southern in theory only, but they sure taste great
But it's the barbecue that really impresses: Pulled pork, though nothing like Carolina's versions, is chunky, chewy, with just enough smoke, while spice-rubbed and sauce-slathered ribs (best enjoyed as a sampler) feature fat-streaked, mostly tender pork and beef
I was on the phone for a long time being put on hold by them
I heard about this place through reviews but had to experience it myself
They had awful service and seemed very cocky
DO NOT go there
No matter how good the food is, with terrible customer service, it's intolerable
The guy didn't even apologize and his excuse was We get a lot of phone calls all the time
So be it
Their prices are expensive too
Down in Texas, when someone is more hype than substance, we say they have a big hat but no cattle
Well, that's blue smoke
It's plenty fancy, but the food just isn't very good
It's dry
It's tasteless
It's expensive
I can't figure out how they make any money
Down in TX, that place would close within a month
Seriously folks, it's just bad bbq
Not that I've found good bbq in this town yet, but there's some okay places at least
But Blue Smoke ain't one of them
My friends and I get together at Blue Smoke as often as we can as we can't live without the blood orange margaritas and ribs! Best low-carb diet I can think of
Sweet potato fries and other sides are also really yummy
Only downside is that you can't just go on a whim as always packed and can't get seated until after 8pm or so
Best to make a reservation approx
one week in advance to ensure seating and time you want
Believe me, this place is worth checking out
Upon walking in I was assaulted by displays selling T-shirts at the bar, making me feel like I had just walked into a tourist attraction
The food was not bad, but not great
The waiter insisted that the marbled version of my dish would add to the flavor, but it really just tasted like a fatty piece of meat
Although the staff is super-friendly, and the main dining area is spacious enough to accommodate large groups, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
I here with my family to celebrate 3 special occasions
We waited 15 min for our table to be ready, not that long for a Sunday night
As we sat down, the manager and server came to our table with complimentary apps to thank us for our patience! WOW! Our server was fantastic the food was amazing
The manager kept coming over (who was adorable to boot!) to make sure we were great
We had a 2 year old with us and they actually had her decorate her very own cookie which they baked at the end of the meal for her
I work in this industry and have never seen such attentive service
I highly recommend Blue Smoke, especially for groups and even more so, it is so hard to bring a young child into a trendy restaurant and they made it so easy!!!
I enjoy going with friends to Blue Smoke
Everytime I have gone to the restaurant we have always had great service and not had to wait for a table
The staff is always accomodating, and you never feel rushed through a meal
I've always had a decent meal at the restaurant, so it can always rely upon them as stand-by
The only problem I had was ordering the salt and pepper ribs, which ended up being dry and chewy
I'd recommend the mac and cheese, if you're a fan of Velveeta
This place serves delicious food
DEELICIOUS
And with portions that guarantee a second meal the next day
After a little glitch with our leftovers, namely they forgot to put a half rack of ribs in our doggy bag, we called them to let them know
Not only did they give us a FULL rack of ribs to replace the lost ones, but they also threw in 2 sides to have with it! Such nice people, top notch service
And SMOKIN bbq!!!
From the moment you enter through the fragrant apple tunnel until you leave and pick up your elaborately gift-wrapped doggy bag which also contains a gift of a fragrant small bread loaf; Bouley rises above the rest! The restaurant is divided into two vaulted cave-like dining rooms with a white room and a red room (this was so romantic with opulent fabrics and carpets and dim Tiffany style lamps on every table
) Service was, of course, impeccable and who can forget the wonderful breads and pastries that Mr
Bouley is so famous for?!! All in all, a great night out!
I was very underwhelmed with Blue Smoke
I had heard such good things and was excited to finally dine at a nice BBQ place in NYC, of which there are none
Yet upon entering and seeing them selling t-shirts and other souveniers I knew this was not what I was looking for
This is a total tourist trap
The BBQ is quite good and sadly is the best in NYC, but that's not saying much
They told me they stopped serving Fried Green Tomatoes because the prep was too difficult and that their Mac n' Cheese was tops in the city, I'd put it average at best
The meats were very good, the pulled pork was phenomenal
Yet the prices were well beyond reasonable value
Everytime I come here I need to wait
But if I get a seat at the bar Idont mind
The ambience is good and the crowd makes you feel that you are getting good food, and its a good thing that you have to wait
THe ribs are good and I havent had anything on the menu that did taste great

) Other than that it's a great casual dinning place
Not romantic, or fancy-smancy, if your down to earth and low key you'll enjoy it
Good place for authentic cuisine! I promise you will not leave hungry
They start you off with free mussels vinagerette, spare ribs, sausages, and salad
Once you've warmed up your stomach with all of these free goodies, please do yourself a favor and have some of the best paella ever
The seafood is enormous and fresh and the rice that accompanies it is a nice complement that doesn't overpower the flavors of the seafood
You gotta try it
The Scene Da Umberto, with its bold fire engine-red exterior, is one of the most boisterous, male-dominated restaurants in downtown New York
Decor, unfortunately, is a weak point--there's an exposed air-conditioning duct and press-board ceiling offset by marble floors
Italian conversation fills the room, and waiters will occasionally speak it exclusively to guests
The Food Simple preparations, using only fresh ingredients, are the hallmarks of owner Umberto Assante's philosophy
Winners include lush portobello mushrooms served with hard polenta in rosemary-infused wine sauce, and gnocchi with rich veal ragu
Roast meats also make a good showing, particularly the giant veal chop in a pool of cognac sauce with chanterelle mushrooms and roast potatoes
An eye-popping array of sweets is shown off on a dessert cart at meal's end
My boyfriend and I met here with some friends for dinner and although our friends (who do not live in NY) seemed pleased, we were dissapointed
The waiter was pushy and we felt pressured to order, especially when it came to dessert
The wine was way over priced and the food was nothing special
We live in manhattan and can think of many other places that are much better value with great wine and food
The ambience was nothing special either
The check was huge and we felt cheated by this below average Italian
We will not be going back and don't reccomend it to anyone
I'VE BEEN GOING TO daUMBERTO FOR LONGER THAN I WANT TO REMEMBER
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS EXCELLENT
I PUT THEM TO THE TEST THIS LAST SATURDAY NIGHT
DESPITE NOT HAVING BEEN THERE IN OVER A YEAR AND BEING LATE ( I CALLED) AND JAMMED, WE WERE REMEMBERED,AND SEATED IMMEDIATELY
THE SERVICE WAS PROMPT, THE FOOD,AS ALWALYSCONSISTENTLY GOOD
IS IT A LITTLE LOUD? SURE
IS IT JAMMED? SURE
IS IT INEXPENSIVE? I'VE PAID MORE FOR LESS
By recomendation of a friend I went to DaUmberto
I was surprised at the romantic, warm and inviting decor, it was the perfect backdrop for a wonderful evening
I was greeted at the door and promptly seated
The staff is wonderful, it is obvious that they are a great team the waiters and the manager were kind and attentive
The prices are just right, the food is superb
I will definitely make Da Umberto a regular
First of all, I cannot understand how anyone can say the service here is not wonderful
My husband and I were treated excellent by everyone from the coat check lady, to thewaiter, to even the owner! In addition, the food was fabulous
I was able to get just what I was craving and both my husband and I enjoyed our meal very much
We both repeatedly said that our pastas were one of the best we have ever had! We look forward to taking our friends here to experience the wonderful meal again!
I was always curious about this place, now I know its worth avoiding
Not worth our time or money
Too many waiters kept pushing water bottles and wine at us
The wine list is expensive and can put you in an uncomfortable situation if you want a simple meal with reasonable wine ($50-60 is the minimum) our $80 wine bottle was OK but not great, obviously great markup for them as they were very enthusiastic about pouring more and more
Food arrived quickly but pasta was too salty and other dishes not exciting
The wait staff pushed us to get desserts immediately after we finished our main course and we had to continuously tell them we are not ready yet
No one asked us how the food was just kept trying to get us drink more wine
Mission accomplished and the bill was hefty but we arent going back
the service was wonderful, pleasant and attentive
i had a calamari special and filet mignon, both of which seemed a bit salty -- still, everything else (i picked off the plates of others) was fantastic and i really enjoyed the experience
I entered Da Umberto because I was intrigued by an authentic Tuscan restaurant in Chelsea
However, the service was horrendous and the waitstaff made it known that the traffic in the restaurant made you, the customer, a replaceable commodity
I resided in Florence, Italy and when inquiring about the availability of a Tuscan favorite (which was not available), the waiter attempted to make me look foolish in the presence of a significant other
Ignoring the merits of the cuisine (which was par at best), I see no reason why one would pay Da Umberto prices for an okay meal and below average ambience
Not recommended
I try to take anyone visiting me in NYC to this place
The food is always excellent! The decor is nice
The food is excellent
The wait staff is very attentive
The food is excellent
Guests always seem to be dressed up for a nice night out
And the food is excellent
Da Umberto is a great choice for a big date night out
At first unassuming, the food was delicious and by the end of the evening I was in love with the place! The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful
Will definitely be back!
I had known of this place for ages but never went in
A group of clients nearby call it their favorite restaurant
I didn't expect much more than another decent meal when I stopped by with my girlfriend one evening
I was pleasantly overwhelmed
The food was rich in taste and texture
The prosciutto was perfectly moist and melted in our mouths
Entrees were served on time and were worth every penny
Try the desert, it is worth saving room for
We had a 9pm dinner reservation and were not seated until 9:45 (even though close to 20 people came and were seated after we arrived)
Our waiter took his sweet time bringing the menus and telling us the specials and it wasn't until almost 10:15 that we put our order in
Besides the horrendous wait, our waiter left the restaurant after we had our appetizers without telling us, another waiter brought us another couple's appetizers, and we were generally treated the whole night as if we had the plague
The food however, was very well done and the pasta was fresh but that it is nowhere near a good enough reason to ever step foot in this establishment ever again
I liked da Umberto
The food was quite good, but I certainly wouldn't say spectacular
They really specialize in meat dishes, and they had more specials than they had menu items, which is a nice touch
The only negative is the wine list: very expensive (none/few under $50/bottle), and the bottle we got for $65 is nowhere near as good as $35 bottles I've gotten in other restaurants
The waitstaff was courteous, friendly and very helpful, never did we feel rushed
The decor is pleasant enough, plenty of room between tables
The bathrooms, though, could have been a bit nicer
Definitely a nice place to eat once, but if you like wine, make sure you take some extra cash (they only take AMEX)
I have eaten here many time over the past 15 years and am constantly drawn back, it is definitly worth the drive from Connecticut
The antipasti is the best I've ever had, the veal chops are divine, the Dolcetta d'Alba is exquiste and the Service is wonderful
Viva Da Umberto!
This is one of the best restuarants in the city
The food, service, and atmosphere make it perfect for every occasion
Get to know Umberto and you'll be dining like a king!!
I love this place
I've been many times and continue to go back because of the excellent food (i always partake of the specials) and the friendly authentic staff
Go
You won't be disappointed
This place is too pricey for a simple noodle bowl
The food is great and so is the service
It is the only authentic Chinese eatery around the area
The Scene It's the mammoth claws adorning the bar and dining room, combined with the lemon-garlic aroma, that cause bib-donning crustacean lovers to salivate
They're so serious about their seafood, they couldn't care less about the crowds in the brick-and-stucco dining room
The Food Waiters get a good workout shuttling specialties from the Spanish-seafood menu to and fro

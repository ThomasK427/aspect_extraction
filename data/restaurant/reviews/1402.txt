Sushi tastes old and fishy, and the steak is low grade choice
(seriously, don't bother eating the food)  Don't go for the food at all, go for fun, order a coupld appetizers, and some drinks

its a great place for groups
For the first time i tried ninja with my girlfriend, we loved it than we had party it was 8 of us, everything was perfect, way behind expectation
We go out a lot this time it was 15 of us I needed a great place, that has a great food, drinks and great atmosphere, amazing stuff
Couldn't think of better place than NINJA restaurant
Ninja coctails are very delicious, then we had sake
We had couple of sushis, rolls then we ordered the course menu
Delicious food, loved the lobster and the sushis are amazing
All of us was very satisfied and happy
Never disappointed
I love ninja!
I have been to ninja many times this year since learning of it on citysearch and they have never failed to impress
They always have the freshest fish, sashimi, fresh wasabi
Ninja is one of the few unique restaurant, VERY different than what Americans are accustomed to
It is highly recommended!
Unexpected good time, joy, satisfaction
The best japanese restaurant we have been to
The fish dishes are amazingly fresh and delicately prepared, especially the sushi
The best way to go is the tasting course, has everything and you dont want to miss the desserts
We were in a group so we all ordered different desserts
Bon Sai, the cheese cake
the presentations are amazing, they are in shapes, tree, frog
crazy!!! And we had sake, not dissappointed at all
Magnificent service, outstanding staff
We had excellent time
Highly recommended, especially for special occasion!!!
Ninja has became our favorite spot
My friends and i when we feel like to go out for a great night, sushi, ninja is our destiny
Service is amazing, place, atmosphere is extraordinary
Delicious food, never disapointed
Always a pleasure
The most ridiculous dining experience I have ever had
Not only was being served by eastern Europeans dressed in cheap ninja drag ridiculous, but the food they were serving was borderline inedible
By the time our meal came to close we had racked up a $550 bill for four and done nothing but dine on small portions of overpriced horrible food
No other word than ridiculous describes this place
Like dining at an expensive Chucky Cheese
Superior sushi can be ordered from any menu a delivery boy slides under your door
To eat at Ninja is just plain stupid
After reading the comments we decided to try NINJA restaurant
I think that this is one of the best restaurant in NY city
Atmosphere is amazing, food is presented extremely well, delicious taste to it, fresh
It was six of us in the party we loved every single dish we ordered
We also tried the sake that was exclusive to ninja
We loved, enjoyed every single moment in ninja
Ninja servers are great
Great idea!!! This spot is definitelly our spot!!
My boyfriend took me to Ninja for our anniversary, knowing my love for japanese food
We ordered one 8 course meal and another set of orders we ordered a la carte
The service was great - for most dishes, including the sake, the waitress was kind enough to split to two generous portions
The taste of the food was only okay, but the presentation of each dish was incredible
The whole night was very enjoyable and the ambience of the place made it a very fun date
This place is amazing
The food is delicious
Kobe beef steak with garlic sauce is the best
The portions are small, tasting portions so we tried a lot of dishes
It was six of us, everybody was enjoying the tasty, full of flavors food
Sushi is excellent
Presentation is amazing
Service, atmosphere is A++
We had a great time, and also dont forget to try sake
Sake tasting is a good start
We had a great time, really enjoyed it
I am a big fan of sushi, in ninja was totally everything excellent
Great food, delicious, along with a great service, atmosphere
We had a great time
The presentation is amazing
My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and we loved every minute of it
We were greeted by a ninja who took us through a mysterious pathway to the ninja village
We then were seated and presented with the HUGE menus
We decided to skip the special Valentine's Day tasting menu and go with one of the other menus (I believe the $150 one) each
We also got several a la cart appetizers that were each delicious and a $100 bottle of cold Sake that I didn't mind (I'm not a big sake person so I can't judge)
Dish after dish, we were treated to all types of exotic meals, each with exquisite presentation
The magician even came to our table and did a cool slide of hand trick
The entire bill came out to just under $500 with tip and while expensive was definitely worth it
The restaurant spent all its' time on presentation, nobody thought about the food
For the large number of high-end Japanese Restaurants in New York City, I felt robbed after dining at this place!
Great time, great food, very good sushi
I will recommended to my friends
Reasonable price
Service, atmoshere amazing
I have eaten here a few times and the 'Kobe steak' with garlic sauce, the sashimi+sushi with fresh wasabi the greatest
Everything I've tried on the menu so far is good too
The atmosphere, service are awsome
Highly recommend this place
Had my birthday here and the service and ambience is great! Fabulous selection of food and liquor (A+ sake too)
Try the lychee Bellini (it was so good I got a second) and the sirloin steak in teriyaki sauce
Sat my party of ten comfortably and were very attentive
Made my birthday one of the best I've ever had!
We sort of stumbled upon this place and were intrigued
Although it is a theme restaurant the presentation and quality of the food was incredible and the theme is actually quite fun once you get used to it
I felt that the price was OK considering the ambience and quality
The dessert presentation was incredible
Check your jaded NYC idea about themes at the door, plan to spend about 80 per person and enjoy!
This is a high end theme restuarant which is much more grown up then others I have been too
The menu is innovative with traditional Japanese dishes
The wine list is very limited however
We did the high end tasting menu and I have to say that the appetizer was great, but the sushi course was way below average for the money and the kobe stype beef was sub par
Ninja is cute

Unfortunate for the tourists because they miss out on the essentials of what is good chinese food and snacks
So when you're in the area stop by and enjoy their yummy almond tofu dessert or the sticky rice that's wrapped in the green leaves
Like walking into a candy shop, you want one of everything! It's not your typical Chinese bakery though
In addition to the usual, you can stock up on pre-made pastries and treats so you can prepare them fresh at home
By the way, I believe this bakery supplies local groceries with their frozen pastries and breads
I've been going to this bakery for the past 20 years
The owner still tends shop daily
It's one of those rare honest old-fashion shops
There is a plentiful selection of vegeterian foods
The food made in the store is much better than the other packaged goods they sell
I love the rice wraps, they are just like what grandma used to make
I recently visited this cafe with a party of four
We were very glad to get out of the cold and be seated immediately for dessert
The trouble began when I noticed that the assortment of pastries on display seemed kind of plain
The waitress sneered that they did not have American coffee when a member of our party asked for one
It was shocking to see that the barista was not making proper cappuccinos
He would half fill a cup with milk; froth up the milk, add espresso, and then froth it again to mix it up
The raspberry chocolate cake served was slightly stale and chocolate cannoli shell appeared to be armor plated
We were glad to leave
Expensive for a cake we weren't thrilled with- $30 for a 6 inch cake for our daughter's 1st birthday
We ordered the almond cake with strawberry filling and buttercream icing and the kids at our party did not like it
The cake itself was heavy like a breakfast bread and with the strawberry preserve filling tasted even more so
We had also envisioned the Dora character we requested would be inscribed on the cake itself and were disappointed with the sugar-wafer Dora that was simply placed on top
I went to tai pan to get 4 swiss roll cake and some  bread
I am taking the cakes on a plane to give away to other people  and you guys are so cheap that you wouldn't give boxes for the cake when  i spend $25
00
My uncle were nagging that it doesn't look good as gift  without the boxes
If it weren't that my aunt keep insisting to take it  I would have left without buying anything
Tai pan is not the only  bakery around
I have plenty of choices
I am very unsatisfy with your  cheap services
I will never go back to Tai Pan (your prices in drinks  and cake are higher than other bakery) and CHEAP services
This IS the most popular bakery in Chinatown
You won't believe how many people you will touch unintentionally, once you step in it
They make incredible pastries, although a bit more expensive than smaller bakeries in Chinatown
If you happen to visit the place during mid-autumn festival (September or Octorber in Lunar Calendar) don't miss to stop by to try their icy-skin mooncakes made with greentea paste, fruits and bean paste
They are special treats for the holidays
Chinese locals line up in the store and they are sold out fast!!!
Good value, delicious, but too crowd if you are there during one of their many rushes
I tried out Tai Pan a couple days ago, and was impressed by the variety of patries that they offer! I randomly ordered three types of bread-buns (one with taro filling, one with BBQ pork filling, and one with egg and onion wrapped outside), and all three tasted great
The price was reasonable as well - $0
70 each
In Short Maria's might be less glitzy than the newer bakeries on tourist-packed Canal, but it's been a longtime mainstay for both its piping hot pastries and fresh juice/boba tea concoctions, with the watermelon juice being especially popular in the summertime
Locals flock here for another reason: Maria's fragrant, homemade jelly drinks, infusing tiny tapioca pearls of the white, delicate variety with mango, honeydew, strawberry, and coconut pudding-like flavors
Hint: Look for them glistening in the self-help beverage refrigerator
The people behind the counter are less than polite, but who cares? It's all about the steamed bread
By far a wonderful place to purchase italian pastry or sit down and enjoy desert
prices are better than most other places in little italy
hard to get waitresses attention at times
In Short At first glance the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory looks just like your typical parlor
Vanilla? Got it
Chocolate? Check
Rocky road? You know it
The not-immediately-apparent secret that sets it apart, however, is its variety of exotic, Asian-inspired flavors
Flavors like green tea, ginger, lychee, mango, almond cookie and taro make for rare, tasty summer treats
hands down the best ice cream ive ever had! at the risk of sounding like a tourist it was well worth the six dollar toll from jersey! the service was excellent
even on a busy night the staff was polite and helpful in choosing a flavor
chinatown ice cream factory made my day!!! im def going back!! deee-lish!!
If, just like me, you can't get enough of the traditional japanese green tea ice cream, DON'T go to this much raved about Chinatown spot to get it
Despite the reviews from other customers praising it's green tea ice-cream, the experience is quite disappointing
It doesn't taste like the ice cream you normally get in any Japanese restaurant
It is not even that green
It's just a regular vanilla ice cream without vanilla and slight-green in colour
It has no flavour, it's too sweet and with nauseously milky taste
My partner had a banana flavoured ice-cream that was just like mine, but yellow in colour with artificial banana smell to it
It wasn't worth a walk, it wasn't worth nearly $10 for two ice-creams, it is not worth 9
9 citysearch rating either
For anyone who loves ice cream as much as I do, you must try this place
It is nearly undescribeable
They have a variety of flavors
Try the green tea and coconut
it's like an exploision in your mouth =)
After seeing it was voted best of I'm always skeptical that someone close to the owner put in a ton of good comments
But this was NOT the case
The ice cream was absolutely awesome
I had the Lychee and Green tea ice cream which were very creamy
I'm definitely going back!!!
Love it! My favorite is cherry pistachio
Whenever I visit I head downtown for some of their ice cream
Best thing on earth!
I love chocolate ice cream but when I come to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory I'm not even tempted
I am hooked on the ginger - sweet, savory, refreshing, creamy
My friend is addicted to the red bean
Whoever wrote that the lychee is like eating the fruit from a grove in Calcutta hit the nail on the head
The servers will help you make up your mind and give you a taste if you are overwhelmed
I make the trip there from miles away just to get a cone
No better way to visit Chinatown
I used to come for the mango and banana flavors
But since they introduced sesame, I've been hooked on it without looking back
Take a quart home b/c you will crave for more in the following days
oh so good! [and that's a man writing them words like a little girl!] i had the lychee: more lychee than the fresh fruit from a grove in calcutta
i tasted my bud's chocolate: delicious
i brought home a pint of mango for my wife and she loved it
think of it like this, if you have to consume such fattening food, shouldn't you die loving every melting, gooey drop? oh! it's worth it! never mind the decor
go to Tao for decor!
I am in love with Green Tea ice cream which brought me to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory
The owner was a great help after he had to tell me he ran out of the ice cream I walked 3 miles for
But the lychee was excellent- recommend
A great place with yummy ice cream and a great walk to get there
I love the ginger ice cream

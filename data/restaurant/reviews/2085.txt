I could hear the ice machine idling
Two songs for a dollar at the jukebox, then dead quiet again
Did we just get old microwaved off-brand dairy section biscuits? Ooh, that chicken looks good! Crunch, crunch
wait
where's the meat? Why is the bit of meat clinging to the breast ribs for dear life the color of the street? Did I just see an employee going to the basement with buckets of prepackaged Pork Chitterlings? Do they make anything here? I'll order the mac and cheese, that has to be good
Not a chance
Warmed-over and slimey
My stomach is honestly in pain right now
Avoid this place at all costs
This place is amazing
The food is fantastic and the ambience is real - something hard to come by in the city these days
By far the best BBQ I've had in New York
I've eaten here twice in one day - and have a new waist size to prove it
when im craving for porkchops, i go to pink tea cup
its inexpensive and savory
I've been coming to the PTC for the past 30 years
Every now and then I have a hankering for some down home food in a no-frills joint with a kickin' jukebox that only the PTC can satisfy
I nearly always have the porkchops, with maccheese and greens
Sometimes they run out of my favorites, but nearly any of their sides will do
They're all good
Much has been made about the service but that's part of the charm to me
These are not super-models or wanna be actresses
If you are courteous and friendly, they respond in kind
Come with an appetite, roll up your sleeves, and forget the diet!
Too crowded, but the food is what you really want to avoid
My potatoes were raw, my hamburger was well done (I ordered it rare) and our orders took forever to come
The beef was the type you can buy at the store--low grade stuff
If you are looking for a truly fine burger, go to any good Greek diner
They know what they are doing with food
And I don't care that their specialty is soul food--they have no right serving inferior burgers
The food was not good at all
The cook apparently was angry at having to do overtime and we could hear her screaming to the top of her lungs about how she felt about having to be there
After all that, the salmon croquettes that she prepared were AWFUL
I promised myself that I would NEVER return to this place
I used to recommend this restaurant to everyone I knew: great food, good value, generally good service
Then I had the worst experience at the Pink Teacup I have ever had in a restaurant, which spoiled this place so much that I doubt I will ever go back
It took us an hour to get our drinks (we ordered water and iced tea)
and by the time they got them to us, we were informed that they were out of tea (even though parties seated after us had been served it)
It took another half hour to get our food, at which point the biscuits were inedible (I dropped one on the table and it clunked)
Our server was rude and didn't apologize for or even acknowledge the delay
I can understand the kitchen running behind, but that's no excuse for rudeness
read that this place had great southern cooking, but whoever said that was WRONG
food wasn't anywhere near good enough to justify service that's never heard of the phrase, southern hospitality
Best Fried Chicken in the City! Cosy, inexpensive and pleasant staff
I take friends from out of town to Pink Teacup for breakfast
Based on the fried chicken and other non-breakfast foods I've tried, I think I'd stick to breakfast foods, especially the fruit pancakes and the grits - by far the best I've ever had
Be prepared to have them both come with lots of butter
Also, there's usually a 10-15 minute wait on the weekends and you're going to be cozy, but the atmosphere is still great with nice waiters and good music
The waiters are busy running around, but don't take that the wrong way
They don't take credit cards, so be sure to have cash
I don't mind the biscuits, but honestly I hardly even get to eat them because I'm too full from the pancakes and grits
Pink Teacup for brunch was quite a gut-buster
Come with the right expectations and you'll enjoy yourself
It's not a glamorous place, nor is it gourmet food
But if you want some outrageously buttery grits and yummy apple fritters, Pink Teacup will satisfy your needs
P

The fried chicken and the biscuits were a little disappointing especially if you've gone to Sylvia's uptown
I heard this place was really good, but my friend and I had a disappointing experience
The food didn't taste that fresh, and the waitress looked like she was off on a different planet (and she was talking on her cell phone for some time)
Also, they were out of macaroni and cheese! If you're looking for some good soul food, make the trek out to the Cornbread Cafe in Park Slope Brooklyn
Pink Teacup just doesn't cut it
I don't understand
I heard good things about this place for sometime so I checked it out
The soup was greasy, the biscuits were made by the Pilsbury Dough Boy, the string beans were provided by the Jolly Green Giant, the chicken was old and tough
The potato salad was bland, the pork chops were not good
What else can I say
Oh the iced-tea was not good either
To top it all off the place was cold! I just rather eat paper next time
FOOD WAS DECENT ENOUGH, BUT SERVICE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH THE FOOD, WORSE THAN EVEN YOUR TYPICAL NY JOINT
If you're in the mood for some solid southern food that's a couple notches above regular diner fare, this is a good bet
My favorites are the strawberry pancakes with bacon and the freshly made lemonade
The fried chicken and corn meal muffins - very scrumptious
Avoid the collard greens though, they came out overboiled and as one previous reviewer said too salty
Service is prompt, it can get a bit crowded at times, it's a smaller place
The walls are decorated with black historical and celebrity figures
I felt like I was eating grandma's home cooking, definitely not a place for health buffs !! The place is small, so it's better to go with a handful of friends
You'll see a few celebraties, so you know the food is good! Our waiter was very attentive, and the general ambience was very hospitable
I wasn't about to lay down $14 bucks for a dinner meal, so I stuck with sides
Mac n' Cheese was okay -- not the worst I've ever had, yams were good, fritters good too, but the peach cobbler was so sugary you couldn't taste the peaches
Also, who the heck taught them to make biscuits?? They were more like rolls -- very bready and not crumbly at all!
Fried Pork Chops, what could be better? Well, free refills on my sweet tea, thats what! I guess this is the Yankee version of Southern Cooking
The food is good and the service was even better, but Damn Yankees have made a mockery of Southern Hospitality
My plate was overflowing, but my cup ran empty
Call me cheap, call me frugal, call me what you want, but any southern gentleman knows, sweet tea is not something that should be limited
Ok, ok so I am making a big deal over something small, Heck the food is so good I have nothing to complain about
The staff here is nicer than anywhere I've been, the food is amazingly tastey, and you get a ton of it for a good price! Go here!
Went on a Friday night with a group of three; place was not too crowded, but when it packs up, you'll be seated elbow to elbow
We all ordered the Fried Chicken with Collard Greens, String Beans, and Corn
The chicken was okay, but certainly on the dry side, the Collard Greens were extremely salty for some odd reason
This place was recommended by a group of friends who dined during the summer, however I will definitely need a second visit to form a concrete opinion
I spent 5 weeks at a Living Food Spa in Aguada Puerto Rico detoxing (no cooked food, no dead flesh, just fruits, vegetables and sprouts)
The only thing I craved for the first 3 weeks were the Pink Teacups Fried Pork Chops
After that urge passed I thought, Well there, I've cured myself of that deadly habit
Then I thought some more and decided why deprive myself of one of the world's most succulent offerings
4 weeks after getting back I strolled into the Tea Cup and savored every bite of those heavenly fried porkchops
Although my ultimate goal is to be a raw food vegan I have come to the realistic conclusion that 90% raw and 10% Pink Tea Cup Fried Pork Chop Eater will just have to do
We went for brunch, get there before 11am or wait forever
The pancakes are good, the strawberry pancakes were delicious
The apple fritters were great

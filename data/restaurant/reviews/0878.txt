Nice ambience if you like diners but the service was lousy
The food was soggy when it came, overpriced as well
The Maitre d' copped a huge attitude in seating us to begin with so much of the experience was annoying before it even started
Is McNally trying to run a nightclub or a restaurant? Don't waste your time
Rude, rude rude!!!
When we were running a little bit late for our 6:30pm reservation, we called the restaurant to inform them that we would be there in 5 minutes
The woman on the other end informed us that it was 6:31pm and that we lost our table already
She changed her mind and said we better be there in less than 10 minutes
Well, we showed up in 5, they kept us waiting and then proceeded to seat us at at a small table for 4 and we were 5
Enough said
We left and went to a much better place Petrosino
we were a party of 6 and we were having a good time until towards the end of our meal, the host mentioned we should move it along (@$%!!) he said y'know, this is not right, there are people waiting and you had the table for a long time already 2 of people in our party went out for a smoke and he also said why don't you guys pay for them now and get the money back from them later
i was shocked!!! our waitress, who was wonderful, had to apologize for him
our party then took EVEN longer after that comment
if we'd known we were going to be rushed out, we wouldn't have spent $350 for food that was not worth bragging
Like the place and the food is good at decent prices
The decor is typical McNally and is a good idea considering most of the LES is losing its rustic/vintage charm with all the gentrification that is going on
Wine list is bad though
Be forewarned, tables are small and tight and the room is LOUD
With all judgemental aspects, the restuarant is not a by product of what all the LES restuarants and bars should be
Too loud for its taste and the people are down right shady
I been living down in the neighborhood for 25 years and for the food and drinks to be called affordable
please
A brunch for two will set You back at least 40 dollars that should be set for a three course meal for two
One of good aspects, is that the food is great and the chef deserves a better ambience with more flavor from the real LES crowd and not trying to cater people from the outside who doen't understand about the neighborhood's originality and style
the food jst isn't that spectacular
The watercress salad was way too lightly dressed, the welsh rarebit was so super small, and the drinks are overpriced
will not be back anytime soon
had a great time with a group of friends, music was really good and the bar is beautiful
nice addition to the neighborhood!!!
I live on the LES and love trying new places
the food was great but the prices are to much
a 60 dollar brunch was not what i was looking for
great food
but will probably just head to the baking company from now on
great venue
it's pumping and stands out from other LES establishments in terms for decor and vibe
long wait for a table but if you can squeeze into the bar area, the wait is worth it
Has excellent garlic prawns (starter), the steak for $15 is spot on
DO NOT miss the toffee pudding
I'm happy to have a place to grab Weiner schnitzel in the neighborhood, but not at 85 decibels
All tile/glass/tin surfaces bounce sound waves around like lottery balls
Staff was abundant but clumsy; the waiter visibly noticed my table rocked back forth, but did nothing to fix it
Stay away from the proclaimed cheap category of wines; it's gutter swill
As for the food: French onion soup was tasty but greasy
L'Express is better
Bar steak was not bad at all, fries were boring
I was hoping for fries like Olives
Aperitif was the Casablanca; it was served carelessly with ice chunks large enough to sink the Titanic
All in all, walk up the street to the Pink Pony instead
My experience at Schiller's was fantastic and the menu boasts an unexpected twist from the predictable menu at Pastis and Balthazar
Amidst the dirt, grime and overflowing trash that supposedly make the LES too cool for commerce, this place stands out as a haven of delicious food and fabulous, knowledgable and attentive service
The crowd was very hip and laid back
It's hysterical to me that those who complain most about the gentrification of this neighborhood are the very ones who started the process in the first place
Get over it!
Schiller's is the kind of place that draws people who dress like Carrie from SexTheCity! I was on a date here and we had a good time
It was very crowded, busy and loud so only go if you want an upbeat place
It took us about an hour to be seated so we went to Meow Mix (the lesbian bar around the corner where although a heterosexual couple we had a fine time getting a drink) so plan ahead or get there early
The food was good and very reasonably priced and our server was excellent
The interior looks just like Pastis but this place is obviously newer and fresher
This place does not belong in the LES neighborhood
Garish, tacky decor
Average food
Bridge Tunnel clientelle - loud, obnoxious
And some dressed-in-black goon as the bouncer
Go to Queens where you belong, Schiller
The other restaraunts that have come here are quiet and unassuming
This place is a sprawling blight
Yuk!!!
In Short Crowds of couples, teenagers and parents with toddlers press up against the long refrigerated display case at this dessert chain, where a variety of ice creams, frozen yogurts and sorbets are made in-store daily
Customers choose flavors like sweet cream, cake batter or banana, add mix-ins--ranging from candy bar chunks and Gummi bears to hot fudge and peanut butter--then servers mash it all together on a frozen slab of granite
I think it's worth it
The friendly staff were great about directing people and being quick
(There is a no-wait stand where you can get your ice cream without the song and dance
) The wait for the normal line was about 20 min but it was bearable because we needed time to decide what to order
Both times I've been there, they played great tunes while you wait
Sometimes they burst into song
As for the ice cream, they have so many options, it's really hard to decide
Just pick something with a bunch of add-ins and come back next time for a different combination
I had sweet cream and raspberries one time and rocky road another time
I really like that it's in the middle of Times Square, near Port Authority and the subways
It's easily accessible and open in the middle of the night!
I understand that the singing ice cream makers would appeal to kids, or even to first-time adults
I understand the appeal of choosing what you want to stick in your ice cream
What I don't understand is people lauding the actual taste of the ice cream
While the flavor is okay, if bland, the texture is weird and gooey - almost like they had to make it easier to mix by adding something not normally found in ice cream
For my money, a double-scoop of Haagen Daz is a better taste experience
I am really appalled at New Yorkers who are supposed to be known for their good taste -and in a city where you can get the best of almost anything, that you allow yourselves to confuse novelty with superiority
I would be hard pressed to find ice cream of a lesser quality than what is found at this place
They have good icecream
I like their big icecream
My favorite icecream is cheesecake icecream with strawberry and brownie!!
Extraordinarily creative food - it's all raw, but certainly doesn't taste that way
Some of this food is sensational
Try the burrito dinner
Enjoy some green soup
When they opened in my nabe, there were some dishes offered for tasting outside - at that time I had a bite of the nut meat loaf and thought it awful
Either the food has changed or I have - while I've avoided the nut meat loaf, I love the other dishes
One feels light and energetic, renewed after eating here
Well spiced and very attractively presented foods - a triumph of culinary imagination - brilliantly executed

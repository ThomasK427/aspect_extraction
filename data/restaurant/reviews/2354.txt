Same quality without the lame service of Magnolia (and proudly lame at that)
Nice help and great cakes
AND it's open surprisingly late for Midtown!
I went here for the first time yesterday to buy a selection of desserts for a meeting
When I told the owner that I was tired of getting dried out cupcakes, brownies, etc
from other bakeries she declared that all of their desserts are very fresh and moist
She helped me pick out an assortment of brownies, cookies and dessert bars
and then threw in a cupcake for free for me to try
The cupcake was out of this world good
It was moist! The buttercream frosting was absolutely perfect! This gave me high hopes for the goodies I bought for my meeting, so I was very happy when every single thing I bought was proclaimed excellent by my fellow attendees
Everyone clustered around the dessert tray trying different things until it was all gone
I would highly recommend Dessert Delivery
The baked goods were excellent, the shop is very attractive and the staff was wonderful
I can't bring myself to shop anywhere else for my bakery delicacies, personal and corporate gifts and specialty desserts
The quality of their cakes, cookies and pastries is so far superior to anywhere else in this city that you become hooked
Sam and Joann are the most helpful and friendly owners who have always gone the extra mile for me when I needed something very special in a short time
My clients love to get my gifts from DD
P
S
The store is beautiful with an adorable tearoom
Having a slight disdain for Sbux, and not quite a Dunkin Donuts purveyor, Juan Valdez fits the bill for my drip coffee needs
Their cappuccino's are served in a generous mug with a bit too much milk and too-sudsy foam
(read: nowhere near 9th street espresso) But, Juan Valdez enters the NYC market, and it's a good thing, where Sbux and Dunkin need some competition
The treats are very bread heavy, but filling
The decor rocks
The baristas are decent, but not the best
If you want a half of cup of a small Nevado (like frappuccinos) for $3
10
by all mean try it out
the lady literally gave me a $3
10 cup of beverage and didn't attempt to blend more to full up the cup but oh she did offer free whip cream??? And the drink was too creamy
I though the service could have been better, the staff are not experience enough to know how to make the drinks without reading the instructions
For the price, the taste and service I'd suggest walking a few block to Green Monster!
This is the place if you want a lot of food cheap
This place has tons of specials, everything from hot sandwiches, to soups, to salads, etc
Everything is fresh because it doesn't last long! They keep churning customers all day long
Every meal comes with either brownies or fruit, and optional pita chips
Can't beat it for 6 bucks
They do move you along like an assembly line since the line is usually out the door
There are tables outside the place in the atrium, but good luck getting one during peak lunch times
Overall, pretty good place
This is one of the Best restaurants around
The Food service are out of this world
Its a very friendly place so dont be surprised to find yourself sharing a glass of wine with one of the owners
Although the place is relatively small; I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a quiet, relaxing atmosphere along with a meal you will tell your friends and family about
The food is excellent, the owners are the nicest guys on the planet and the waitresses are beautiful and sweet beyond belief
But I'm biased as I used to work there
Nicole's is an interesting place that serves interesting food
The potato pizza was very unusual
I wouldn't say it was great, but I am glad I tried it
The rest of the food had the tendency to be over-salted
That said it was also interesting
I have a feeling that some people could really love this place
I did not
However, I don't regret going
The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is courteous
The bread is absolutely wonderful and they have a good tea selection
Overall, it's a decent place that is overpriced for what you get but worth trying once
Whenever I shopping in midtown, I always make sure my lunch break is at Nicole's
I love the atmosphere and the selection of fresh food
While prices might seem a tad high for lunch - it is worth it! The salads and bread is delicious
I always recommend this to friends from out of town and they always love it
Even with English phenom Annie Wayte jeting back and forth between London and New York, the food at the New York branch of this bi-pondal eatery remains top drawer
It seems much of the credit can be fobbed off on the talented new chef Tina Bourbeau and her staff
This place remains so undiscovered it makes me wonder what Manhattanites have for brains
This restaurant is the sleeper of New York - even if only open for lunch
I LOVE this restaurant-- the food is delicious, innovative, and healthy, and I'm a picky eater
If you're at Barney's and waiting in line for Fred's, do yourself a favor and go across the street for a guaranteed seat and excellent food
We often go at night and eat virtually alone, puzzled as to why a place with such great food and service has not be discovered by more people
Everyone we bring loves it as much as we do
Went for lunch on a Sat
afternoon and was pleasantly surprised overall
The food was good, not fabulous, the service was very good and the atmosphere was very nice
Will definitely return
I think that Turtle Bay is a great local bar and restaurant
I come here regularly to hook up with my friends for drinks
When my family is in town, I bring them here for lunch
The daytime bartender is awesome
He's friendly and mixes a perfect cosmo
He also plays great music
The food is really good, in fact, surprisingly so for what I initially thought was just a bar
It comes out fast and the wait staff is very good
I always go during the day
Cocktail hour is fun, too
The crowd is a vey nice mix of local people
Lots of regulars, but it's a good place to meet, too
The night crowd is louder and more crowded
I don't usually go then
It's a shame a fairly decent bar can be completely ruined by horrible service
The bouncer was COMPLETELY rude and out of line
He was literally screaming in my face because I had a hat on my head for 10 seconds (I'm female, and they apparently have a no hat policy)
He was furious that I questioned him
I will never in my life return to this place
There much better bars in the area to chose from
Turtle Bay plays host to college football fans from everywhere on Saturday
Sadly, the service staff are completely rude about accomodating games for everyone, even when there is the same game on two TV's next to each other
The fight isn't worth it
Secondly, the service at Turtle Bay is awful, awful, awful!! Forget about having a beer in one hand and a wing in the other
We got so frustrated with our waitress, who stopped by twice over the course of 2 1/2 hours, that we had to order everything from the bar
There are much better places to go and we definitely won't ever go back

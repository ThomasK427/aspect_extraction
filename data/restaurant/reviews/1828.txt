The place was packed, lively and exciting! The brunch menu is a cut above the typical brunch choices and the quality of each main course was outstanding! The brioche french toast was great; the sour cream waffles amazing! And, they've got the tastiest bacon we've ever had! A fun, satisfying place!
At Balthazar - the bridge tunnel crowd prevails
The only New Yorkers here are unattractive, badly dressed men on the prowl
The food is decent, but certainly not worth the reservation hassel and the cramped quarters
If you must go, brunch is your best bet
I'd stick with Pastis, the menu is more exciting, the crowd more low-key, and the vibe altogether better
This restaurant had all the amenities you need for a great dinner
Great food and ambiance are something special here
We went with a party of 7 and got seated promptly and food came out on time
I would recommend it anytime
Started off great, as someone in our party knew the hostess so we got seated immediately
However, the brunch/lunch menu offered little variety and the dishes were common and uninspired
Furthermore, the service was horrible as some of our drinks and side dishes NEVER arrived
This place is living on its reputation, which is being diminished everyday this place is open
It's expensive and has inconsistent service but you cant help but love it! Its really the atmosphere that you pay for and is what keeps on bringing me back because I'm not too thrilled with it otherwise
Food - depends; sometimes it's FANTASTIC, sometimes it's okay
Same with service
While its usually buzzing with people, it's really nice and quiet on weekday mornings
Great coffee, FABULOUS bread (which you can buy next door at the bakery)
Despite it's faults, it really is all together quite fantastic
If you're going for it's coveted Sunday brunch - make reservations a couple of days in advance!
The food is amazing and the service is even better (your water glass is always full)
Very busy atmosphere, but it's fun
Casual or dressy, this is a great place to eat the prices are much lower than you would expect for such a hip place
we ate at balthazar for lunch on a saturday afternoon
the place was buzzing with people
overall, the food was excellent, the restaurant decor a must see, and pleasant waiters
try any of the sandwiches on their lunch menu
a balthazar must have!
In general it's a pleasant place to meet with your friends for a weekend brunch
The food is satisfying
The service is ok
For what it has to offer, I just think it's way too pricy
A very basic brunch will cost you about 60-75 per person
You can find a better deal in the City
It started out as too hot for non-celebrities to get into
Now it's a NY classic
I loved the food and ambience from day-one, but hated that it took a month to get a reservation
The food is amazingly still great after many years, which is unusual for a restaurant to maintain that track record
After 9/11 the NY Times commented that the service became friendly
That is still the case
Balthazar is now my new, favorite neighborhood restaurant, as unlikely as that would have seemed when it opened
A bit too loud, but food was amazing and service - friendly
Will go back any day
The atmosphere was great, however, reservations seem to mean nothing! We waited for an hour for a wonderful meal but could have been handled more efficiently
Balthazar,is a wonderful restaurant
Our reservations,were for 6 p
m
, and we were seated right away by the couteous hostess
Our waiter was great,and the food was really good
The bread basket it awesome!Try the goat cheese and onion tart, short ribs and frites
Theyr'e all great!!The prices are reasonable, the location great, and the scene, was absolutely perfect, very buzzy and busy!!! We look forward to going back
Have eaten here a few times recently, it's always lively
Everything we've tried has been very good
Staff have also been very good
Keep it up !!
Great Sunday Brunch! Balthazar is about three things Food, Decor Ambiance  The food is great try the warm goat cheese onion tart, the onion soup (to die for
) or the brioche french toast
The decor is typical of an authentic parisian bistro
Including their snooty waiters
So don't expect romantic or high end decor
The ambiance is see and be seen, with alot of buzz in the air
Everyone is just getting over saturday night and reving up again around noon with their hang over cocktails
Great for couples, girls brunch or large groups of friends catching up about the night before
My wife and decided to stop into Balthazar for dinner on a recommendation from a friend
Once seated, the waiter and his friend the bar usher of some sort sat against the bus station producing one liners to each other about everyone and everything
Snickering and smirking while we waited
Once the waiter finally came over, with a forced accent of some sort, we ordered
He went back to were he was and had to tell a few more jokes seemingly anyway, about us
The whole dinner we felt like we were under the judgment of Mr
Mr
Black the fashion critic who himself is a misfit and of style and somehow thinks he is in a position to rate others
EVERYTHING was late and clumsy
The food was good and the room beautiful
However, the service was just repprelling we were NOT impressed and would not go back
The food at Balthazar is fine
It's not amazing, just fine
The service is just fine also
It's very crowded mostly with tourists
I pretty much think its overhyped
It's nothing special and there are smaller places that serve much better food and have a better crowd
I have eaten at Balthazar a few times and I have never had a bad meal
I love the frech onion soup and the brioche french toast
I also love the steak frites and I think this is one of the best Sat and Sun places to get brunch
This restaurant is always crowded and loud and it is quite a scene, but it is nice to dine here when in the mood
They have a great raw bar and a pretty good wine list, but it all comes at a hefty price
During a NYE trip to NYC with friends, we were sorely disappointed at the long wait and food at Balthazar
Yes, the decor is magnificent, but nothing you can't get in a nicely decorated home
The staff was less than spectacular
Go elsewhere
Balthazar is a classic at anytime (lunch and dinner)
if you are looking for their great brunch menu though, its only on Sundays, their Saturday brunch is different and more like a lunch menu
As always do try the fries
Still my favorite place in New York City, and the only place I can actually get my husband to try new things and like them!! The food is overwhelmingly wonderful, even if the servers remain a bit aloof
It's all charming!
My husband and I went recently and the staff was phenomenal
the food
oh-oui-oui
delicious!
EXCELLENT OVERALL!! My all time fav for morning until nite

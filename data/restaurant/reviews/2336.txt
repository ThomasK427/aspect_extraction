Steaks were prepared to our satisfaction and were very tasty
Side dishes were good, but were cold when served
Christmas decorations were beautiful
Nice ambience, but tables are way too close together for an intimate dinner
We would return
Time was the Manhattan Grille was one of the steak houses in the City
It's now approaching also-ran status
Steaks and seafood are just so-so, service is a little too cavalier, yet the prices remain pretty steep
If you do go, stay with the basic steak/seafood stuff, though, and don't even think of straying to the Italian specialties; they leave a lot to be desired!
I attempted to order breakfast from Wrap Run the other day
First, the woman who answered was so hurried that I didn't get to order what I wanted
Then, she wrote down the wrong phone number
When I called an hour later, she proceeded to yell at me saying I had given her the wrong number
Then they tried to redeliver, never got it
When I called to cancel, she canceled it
BUT then she called me back to yell at me
I'm sorry, but if you hate your job, get a new one
but leave me out of it
I will NEVER order from them again solely due to the woman answering the phone
They never give up
The service is super friendly, the food is always top notch, and the prices just cant be beat
Find me a better place and dinner is on me
My wife and I have been regulars for years
We have our table and the waiters love our 2 year old
Without a doubt, Brio is the best moderately priced Italian place on the upper eastside
The pizza is the best in the city; pastas are fresh and tasty; the salads are vibrant; and the specials are always exemplary -- particularly the rib-eye, when they have it
We even order in from this place
In fact, don't eat there -- it'll get more crowded than it already is
I have eaten all over the city, and no restaurant offers the food that is present at this midtown Italian eatery
The pizza is by far the best in NEw York city, even though not many know that they offer pizza here
Whether you live out of town, or right next door, it is an unforgettable dining experience
I have been to many Italian restauarants in my 24 years of living in NYC, but this one takes the cake
The service is great, they are nice, and very accomidating
A small bistro, with 4 star food
Each time is better than before!
I just don't understand the previous two reviews
I am a regular at Brio (have been for about fifteen years), and I keep finding that everytime I try some new, more expensive place I am wishing that I were back at Brio
The food is second to none and the service, in my humble opinion, is excellent
The servers are extremely friendly, the food comes as quickly as it feasibly can (without pre-making it and keeping it under a heat lamp), and the staff is happy to think outside the box and change dishes accoring to your desires
Despite the fact that Brio is a neighborhood type restuarant, I regularly entertain clients from out of town there, and they love it
I can't think of anything remotely negative to say about this restaurant
The food at Brio was really great
The service however was lethargic to say the least
We waited for menus, we waited for a drink order, we then waited for the drinks and bread to be served, etc
The main came out quickly but then we waited for coffee
We were going to get desert but then waited, AGAIN, too long to even have the desert menu explained to us
We were just tired of waiting
I'd rather starve
Worth a trip across the country for the Gorgonzola Bread alone
Then you add low, low, low prices and friendly service
can't go wrong
For anyone who thinks food at Angels is bland, order the Vongole con Pompodore, which is linguine in a red, spicy clam sauce
It's my favorite dish there
I won't even order linguine with clam sauce anywhere else because I can't find one as good
I've tried many, many dishes at Angels over the years I have been going there, and they've all been quite good
There's a dish with lobster and a cognac sauce that takes a close second to my vongole con pompodore
I almost always go home with leftovers and the prices are very, very reasonable
My friend and I usually sit in the smaller half of the restaurant, which doesn't get very crowded at all!!  Oh, and yes, the gorgonzola bread is OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD
Great athmosphere, relal drinks, good food, outside sitting and inside romance accompanied with live piano
Try the Duck!!! it was fantastic
3 of us had a great dinner there Monday night
Quiet night
all the food was very good, the specials-genuine Italian seafood! crabcakes, Gnoochi (eggplant) and Tuna
we're in a hurry to go back and try more dishes
ERC has been a favorite point for friends
Lively bar atmosphere quiter dinning away from the bar
Had many a birthday dinner/celbration there no fuss when the party grew in numbers
Staff are great, super nice! Fav
dishes are the chef's specials - always great food
Cocktails are Strong! excellent value
I ordered from Chicken Kitchen at 8:00 p
m my food arrived downstairs at 10:30, not only did I have to wait over 2 hours for it to get here I also had to go downstairs and get it, and good luck getting in contact with someone at the restaurant
The chicken is barbequed to perfection
The tabouli salad was outstanding and the rice was delicious
Great food - low cost
The food at Forest Hills was great, the service more than perfect, but but the ambience was too hot they do not have AC and the employes was sweating a lot , it was a nasty esxperience because I eat in front of the service that was sweating like animals
I'm so sorry , people should go in winter
but Cabana still good
I went to the location in the South Street Seaport and the food was absolutely fabulous! Server was responsive and quick without hovering over the table
The meal was absolutely delicious and the banana fritters for desert was very tasty
Inexpensive and worth the trip
I went to Cabana and was dissapointed
The avocado salad was tasteless and horrible
I then tried the ceviche which was terrible and had zero flavor
I wanted to believe that they could make something good so i ordered the stuffed plantains and couldn't get through one of them
I've had better food and corner cuchifritos in the outer boroughs
The service was absolutely horrible, the food was nothing to brag about
Totally overrated and I would not recommend either one of their locations because there are both terrible
Great food, nice ambience definitely suits my picky tastes I went here for my birthday
If you are in the mood for something ethnic and bursting with flavor I highly recommend this spot
Try the Tres Leche cake for dessert it is to die for
First went to cabana a year ago and since then have gone at least once a month
delicious food
great atmosphere
bring a group of people and share entrees, you cant loose
Dont leave untill you try there mojitos, you'll get hooked
I was
This place is always hopping, has a relaxed atmosphere, and delicious latino/cuban food and drink
I always get the chicken and shrimp special for dinner
The apps are good too, either the empanadas or the tostones

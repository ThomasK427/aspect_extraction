Reviews are right, portions are generous
Sushi was overall very good, nothing spectacular, but I liked the overall no-nonsense and casual atmosphere of the place
Luckily got their early and had no wait, by the time we left there was a long line
The waitress of very efficient and pretty courteous
The lobster tempura was ok but my girlfriend really liked it
The gyoza was fantastic in my opinion
love sushi
but always feel like you can eat 10 more pieces then try it here
the cuts are Huge!  the fish has a great taste
this is a straight up sushi place
nothing fancy and it wont leave you broke
Get there early since they dont take reservations over the phone and I've never seen it without a line/wait
Yama offers good sushi without robbing the bank
It's become a popular restaurant when I need comfort food
Food with good value with no pretense
The ice-cream tempura is a must-try
Yama seems to have lost its edge
Multiple cuts of fish lacked any noticeable flavor or edge to them
Though the cuts were huge, who cares when the taste is so unmoving? The tempura was soggy and contained too much squash
The shumai were pastey and greasy
All in all, a pretty disappointing visit
As per another reviewer, Mishima over on Lex and 30 is superior in terms of both food and service
A bit more pricey, but you won't feel like you've just sucked down raw cardboard for an hour
generous portion and tastes good
I think the price is a tad bit too high
but then look at the location
After reading the reviews about Yama, I was wary to try it, but both my sushi-snob Japanese fiance and myself enjoyed it
The rolls were big and flavorful, the sashimi generously cut, and the special rolls uniquely designed
I really enjoyed the white tuna tataki (the sauce was scrumptuous), and the hijiki
My fiance thought the large proportions were good, that the other ratings were way too low, but that he still prefers Tomoe sushi
I could go either way
they were both pretty tasty and we actually got seated faster at Yama
(don't bother for a table, the sushi bar is just as pleasant)
Here is one of the overrated Japanese restaurants where most Japanese do not want to go
Americans tend to think big sushi is better
If you think so, you do not know the difference between rice ball and sushi
Cooking sushi is very difficult and it takes time
As far as I know, chefs of Yama and Blue Ribbon Sushi (among Top 10 Sushi nominees: forget Sushi Samba which offers totally diffenrent food) are not trained to cook sushi at all
If a restaurant is going to make you wait a couple of hours, mix up the waiting parties, and give you cramped service in a cramped space, the sushi better be good
But Yama's sushi isn't good; its just big
Yes, the pieces are gargantuan but the fish is tasteless, the rice even more so, dried out with rice kernels falling all over the place, not memorably melting in your mouth
Its sushi on an assembly line
For good sushi, a cramped and crowded space is worth it
Just try Mishimi, you'll forget you're eating in a shoebox
You don't mind a long wait and the waiters getting the parties mixed up once you taste the bluefin toro at Nada
Next time I want excellent sushi, I'll be inconvenienced by Nada or Mishimi and at least get good fish
I've been going to Yama now for about 4 years
I used to go there sometimes and try other places occasionally
Recently I've realized that I don't even enjoy any sushi besides for Yama
It's that damn good!
Fresh fish, great rolls
My personal fave location of yama is on Carmine, do NOT go to the Houston location, but this one and Carmine are really good!
The fresh sashimi portions were gigantic, but the maki rolls that i ordered had more vegetables than fish inside
It can take awhile to get a table and once you're in, you might be squished between other closely oriented tables
A small restaurant with huge portions
Sushi rolls are not fresh at all! I think the restaurants are trying to be a fusion, but it not even close to the flavor
Fish are not fresh enough because, it's rather warmer than cool to keep the taste up
Rolls are too much with other mayonaise and other rare sause
For that money I will afford to other sushi place
Yes the atmosphere could be better
Yes the place is always crowded
Yes you sit close to other couples
But this place is all about Sushi, Sushi, Sushi
The pieces are 2-3x the size you get at a normal high end joint and the freshness simply can't be beat
So put your name down and then go across the street for a beer
It will be worth the wait!
Although the sushi was extremely delicious, albeit expensive, I couldn't help but wish that I was at the other Yama on Carmine street since I was forced to listen to the 2 conversations around me b/c of the unbelievably small dining area
I have been to Nobu, Bond Street and all the others
if you have the time to swing by check in and come back 15 minutes after he tells you too
The Fresh large portions of Sushi are worth the wait
Went for the first time and thought the special rolls I ordered were delicious
Yes, the pieces are big or even super-sized and while this may not be 100% authentic it is yummy
and for the prices they charge the roll should be very large
One portion that was small was the edamame
Vegetable sushi choices are limited but those offered are very tasty
I would go back if a friend wanted to but I woulndt go out of my way to go there
If I were in the market for pricy upscale sushi I would go to Haru instead
At least the tables there aren't on top of each other and they take reservations
Amazing! Don't go here for the atmosphere, don't go here for the specialty drinks, don't go here for a waitstaff that will kiss your feet - go here for the unbelievable sushi
This is the best you will ever have - stop whining and grab a drink across the street - it's totally worth the wait!
there is almost always a line and a min
of 20 minute wait time for a table
def
not a good place for groups - best in pairs as you will get seated faster
it's a rushed kind of dinner but worth it - the rolls and the sashimi are very good, better than most of the NY Japanese restaurants in the same price range
and you MUST try the fried ice cream dessert!
I'm shocked any REAL sushi lover would call this place OK
Excellent, sometimes a wait, but always worth it
Amateurs should quit taking up space!
This pub/restaurant is a perfect haven to get in from the cold, have a great conversation, memorable food, and overflowing beverages! The staff is very personable, and friendly
The 'mood' is comfy and almost like you hae been there ten million times before! Great hiding spot!
went on a sunday afternoon for brunch, the shrimp and scallops were bland and tasteless
the enchiladas and tacos were cheesy but not very good
they did not serve bloody marys which was odd, the margarita was watery
a very disappointing expieriance
i dont know why the place is usually packed, even the salsa was tasteless
Not the best but reasonably priced and and pretty good selection of margaritas with various grades of tequila available by the pitcher if you like
The food is good, plentiful and loaded with cheese
Specials are usually pretty good
The mole is sadly nothing special, i make a better one at home and I'm about as gringo as you get, but it's a good place to soak up a few margaritas and enjoy a meal with a group of friends

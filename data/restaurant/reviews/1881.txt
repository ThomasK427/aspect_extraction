Not only was the food delicious

Good star sightings
Sat next to George Lucas
Unbelivable food,big portions,crowded,expect to wait even with reservations
By far the best Italian food in NY
Even though it is a bit pricey, this restaurant always delivers great service and delicious food
Great food
Worth the wait, although the waiters are a bit quick, trying to get you in and out
The place is a madhouse of frenzy
Tables are packed together in this small space and the noise level is almost deafening
The quality of the food is superb; you wont get better Italian
Before you order anything, about 5 dishes of food are brought to the table
Very expensive but the service is very friendly and knowledgeable
You must have reservations or forget it
Try the dover sole, huge veal chop or sea bass
Great as always - albeit the wait
Oh I love the Veal Romana
the best italy has to offer
the plates are enough for two the atmosphere is cozy and charming
This restaurant has decent food, albiet an old style Italian menu
New Yorkers should realize that there are numerous excellent Italian restaurants that have better, more authentic and more contemporary food than what Il Mulino is doing, which is not what they're preparing in Italy today
I think Il Mulino is riding on the coattails of it's past reputation when there were fewer Italian restaurants and fewer good Italian restaurants in NYC
i came here expecting the best, and i got an average meal for an insane price
the food wasnt what it was cracked up to be and it was not worth my while
Although IL Mulino wasnt terrible it wasnt what it was cracked up to be
Even if you make reservations expect to wait for at least 30-45 minutes
Il Mulino is a good Italian retaurant, but is over-rated in my opinion
The seating is tight and uncomfortable
The food is often salty and greasy
As a New Yorker who has eaten in many many NYC Italian restaurants, I would place this restaurant as better than average, but not one of the top spots
Good food
Good service
well served
Dont order too much, ask before
This is the BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT in NYC
I feel like i'm on vacation In italy at this place
Don't eat all day before you dine here cause the food is plenty, they start feeding you as soon as you come in
You'll have to wait for a long time if you're not in with the management or Fernando, but it's worth it, have some campari and cinzano at the bar! It's nearly impossible to get a reservation so once you're in, just chill out and enjoy!
The ambience and service were first rate
The problem is with the menu
It is old line Italian-American and appears not to have been updated in years
While the food is good and portions large, there are at least a dozen neighborhood Italian restaurants in the city with the identical menu at a fraction of the price
Innovative it is not
If your looking for something more sophisticated try Baboo
This was my second visit
It was worst than the first
The restaurant was over crowded
The table next to us was extremely loud and no one would ask them to keep it down
The food was very,very salty
I had the garlic lobster
No way was it 2 1/2 lbs
It had no taste
Neither did my mushroom ravioli and gnocchi
My husband had the rack of lamb which was also salty
Between the noise and the bad dinner we passed on desert and left
Dinner for 4 cost us $520
The maitre'de said he would make it up to us next time
I don't think so!
this place has hands down the best food in ny
I first ate at Il Mulino 2 weeks after it first opened
While at first it was a bimonthly Sat
night feast, its popularity( and the growing lines) forced less frequent visits
For the last 7-8 years its been 2-3 times a year-It is clearly the best Italian rest
that NYC offers(although Il Giglio is often more accessible)
It is truly my benchmark restaurant
The food was amazing
The service was also good
The price was high but like the saying goes you get what you pay for I would recommend this to anyone who likes good Italian food
After waiting 45 minutes for our table we then received our exorbitantly priced wine which the waiter then spilt, our Caesar salad was soggy but our main courses were delicious just not worth $55 for veal chop
Go elsewhere trust me!
I had heard so much about this place and it was a good dinner but I expected much more in flavor, presentation, service and overall italian dining experience
Il Mulino has terrific food!   Il Mulino also makes you wait a month to get a reservation, seats you 30 mins late, crams you intoyour table and costs twice as much as it should
This is what we got for our $300 dollar meal, 2 orders of baked clams, Branzini for one meal at a cost of $53 dollars and a pasta for the other that was too salty and much and too hot
It was barely edible
Desert was a chesecake and one just one scoop of sherbert, we were informed we would be charged for an extra scoop
And to add insult to injury we were seated next to a table of 6 of the biggest men I have ever seen
I had to change my seat to the other side of the table mid meal! The guys said Thank you the restaurants attitude, hey its all part of the ambiance
If this sounds like a great night out
keep calling you may just get what you wish for at a very high price and that $300 price was without the tip!
Did not live up the hype
First, lost my reservations
Had to ask 3 times for the wine list, then got the wrong wine
Average wine list
The portions are just too big
But this being America maybe people see that as a good thing
Also nothing on the menu seemed creative
The room is too dark
Our plates looked so worn out that they seemed to have been used a diner
To be concise good food but way overpriced
World Class? NOT maybe St
Louis Class
Of course it's amazing
They begin bringing you food from the moment you walk in the door and don't quit until you slowly struggle to walk out after eating far more than your body weight and washing it down with a jolt of grappa at the end

The White Chocolate is AMAZING
Although it may be a bit expensive (it's NYC afterall), it's worth every penny
It's a weird-looking place, but food is all about the flavor and their flavors are truly awesome
Don't get me wrong-Cones is a great product and it has a great location but I go out of my way to make the trip to Gelatone II on 3'rd Ave even though I don't live anywhere nearby
Gelatone II is like discovering a new delicacy-you'll feel like your tasting gelato for the first time
As expensive as Cones but as one add on the wall at Gelatone II notes,at least you save the airfare to Florence
Closest thing to an orgasm you can have without getting into bed
White Chocolate Mousse is out of this world, Ginger has great kick, Banana is simply delish
Only neg is I live too close to the place and seem to eat it too often
a great variety of flavors and amazing taste make this small store in the Village a standout among its peers
Definitely the best ice cream in town!! These Argentine Ice Cream place has the best Dulce de Leche and Coconut ice cream I have ever tasted
Not sure what flavor to ask for? Don't worry! At your first sign of confusion, you'll be handed a small spoon of whatever flavor you're sighting at that moment
A true classic in just a few years!
I ADORE CONES
IT IS THE ONLY TRUE GELATO IN NYC
I have been to Italy and this stuff is the closest thing I have found to true gelato
The flavors were wonderful and it was fun sampling different things
The prices are a tad high for a large cone, which is what I like to get, but it was worth it to me
OK so I went here with high hopes since they seemed a bit expensive,basically i have been here numerous times just because i am waiting for it to knock my socks off and it is very close to a friends house,I have tried various flavors of their ice cream and sorbets -none of them has been exceptionally memorable-yesterday just before the rain I did find the place that was specatular its called Bussola Gelateria its a small place on the east side of 4th ave between 9amp;11th(65 fourth ave)
Any gelato lover must make a trip to Cones
Their gelato rivals those from Italy
Great selection of flavors(espicially coffee chip ) and newcomers can't go wrong with the wafflecone double scoop
Enjoy
Great selection and creamy texture
The price may shock you but it is worth it
Not your typical cone
I've only ever tried the chocolate with the banana, but it is so good I can't stand it
They deliver, too which is dangerous
Can't believe this place isn't packed all the time
Amazing strawberry and hazelnut ice creams, gelatos really, that don't taste like anything else
Sticking to the diet? Go for the lovely sorbets--especially grapefruit and cantaloupe
For those of us who still miss Moon Dog, a good replacement
An NYU student from Maryland, I took my parents there in May and we're still talking about it
A little expensive, but very worthwhile
Stop in for a sample if nothing else
American palates are used to ice cream being heavy and nothing but heavy cream
There's a place for that, I suppose, but I don't know why you'd want it when you could have the amazingly fresh, homemade gelatos, sorbets, and ice creams here
I'm partial to the fruit flavors, particularly cantaloupe, but everyone needs to try the Lemon Dom Perignon at least once in their lives
I don't need to say much more than that
it is really a waste of money, as the ice cream isn't creamy whatsoever
Breyers has more creamy texture
They try to make up for it with the myriad of flavors, but that's again negated by the exorbitant prices
Save your money
Pick up some Ben Jerry's
A true real Ice cream, rich on flavor, made with real ingredients not a fake cream just the real thing
Best ice (with cream) around
Not great not horrible

We called ahead of time to get directions and the guy at the store told us it was on 3rd Avenue!
The Scene One of Williamsburg's better-looking, more people-packed gardens lurks behind Carmaya, a sleek restaurant on a side street away from the hubbub of Bedford Avenue
Jumpy house music plays on the stereo, making it all the more fitting that menus and wine lists come in the form of CD cases
The service is as casual as the crowd
The Food The surprisingly varied and reasonably priced Italian menu covers everything from simple pastas (good fettuccine with oyster mushrooms, asparagus and black summer truffles) to ossobuco salad with purple potatoes and salsa verde
Seafood items like sea bream filet over cherry tomatoes and baby vegetables and a crab cake with mesclun greens are also worthwhile
Awesome chowders and fish specials
The ambiance is great, especially in the summer when you can linger over drinks in the garden long after you've finished dinner and dessert
The tropical drinks are always fun, especially when you're walking on a sand-covered floor surrounded by surfboards seascapes
Definitely one of my favorite places to take friends for a laid-back time - it's cool enough to be a Williamsburg hangout, but not so cool that you can't get in on weekends because of all the bridge-and-tunnelers
This place WAS Italian when it first opened about three years ago and it was very good
We went back recently and I am not sure what happened, but it's a disaster
It's half fish shack/surfer bar and half Italian food, which does not work! The service was awful and the food was terrible
Skip this place
Thought the setting is great, the service was horrendous and inept and the menu was confusing
The fish of the day can be prepared five different ways according to the menu, but fails to mention that those five different ways are just five different sauces that come out with the whole, deep fried fish
Under no circumstance should you order the fish taco which is more like a big mess of a burrito
Stick to the drinks
Unlike some of the overly hipster restaurants on Bedford, the laidback atmosphere is the crowning glory to this little place
Food is great and varied (the calamari and spinach ravioli were delicious), kind of a seafood shack you'd find up in Maine with New York style
Service was good but relaxed, and in the course of our meal we heard everything from Pete Yorn and the Pixies to Akinele and L

It made for a great time
The food was good overall
The lamb could have been cooked a little more
The ravioli plate was small, not enough for the money
My friend wasn't even partially full after eating
The caeser salad was great
The fried calamari was even better! And they give lots of free bread
The waitress forgot to serve some drinks and was pretty ditzy
The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark
My Roomie and I went here and we had a blast
Great food and fast service and great recommendations by the staff
and WOW what a mojito and best coffee
Carmaya has an innovative menu (Parmasan ice cream for an appetizer?) at VERY reasonable prices
I recommend going on a warm, summer night because the outdoor garden is incredibly romantic -- it even has manicured grass underneath the tables! I loved my entire meal from the creative, summer cocktail to the appetizers to the main course, a wonderful spinach ravioli -- it was truly delicious! One improvement could be made in their service
Although fairly attentive, we couldn't derive a lot of information out of our waiter
Other than that, it was a spectacular meal for 3 people -- with drinks(3), appetizers (2), main courses (3) and desserts (2), it came to about $80 -- not bad for an Italian meal that I thought was in the same ballpark as Lupa
This could have been a really excellent dining experience, the food and atmosphere are great, exceptional given the price
If only there was a waiter for our section
we had to ask for everthyng after waiting and noticed it wasn't only our table
the hostess and busboy were great
if we had a waitstaff for our table it would have been nice
sevice was non-existent
the wine list is varied and reasonably priced
the pasta dishes delicious and desserts were impressive and well thought out
need to hire more staff
The Scene A mellow, Mediterranean mood prevails at Palma, a Sicilian spot that solidifies Cornelia Street as one of the best small restaurant blocks in Manhattan
Decor is simple and soulful; well-chosen music and soft-voiced servers help the restaurant dance to a sultry undertow
The Food Grilled fish are at the center of the menu, and preparations like swordfish with mint, lemon and capers are the clearest indication of the food's Sicilian roots

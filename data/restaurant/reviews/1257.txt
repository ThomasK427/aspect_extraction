I love dining at Falai
The food is excellent, the ambiance is nice (there is an outdoor garden in the back), and the service is good
Out of the several entrees I have tried, I would recommend the pork
It was very tender and flavorful- the fennel seeds and cocoa nibs are a nice touch
For an app, I like the gameroni, but make sure to save room for dessert
The prices are reasonable as well
I am looking forward to dining there again soon
I don't know where the last couple of reviewers went, but I had a great experience at Falai
I consider myself a pretty harsh critic and I can't think of anything bad to say about this restaurant
The decor was spare but tranquil not cold
The food was interesting and well done
I had a heavenly dish of risotto with green pea and sea urchin roe
yum
Also, the prices were extremely reasonable
Go see for yourself
Falai was a disappointment
The white interior, location and menu seem to be aiming for a modern, light experience and cuisine
What results however is underflavored, underrealized, and amateurish
The place is too small to accommodate the few waitstaff they can squeeze in and without enough a/c to cool a full house--especially with the open kitchen right in the middle; the hostess was pulling double duty and not doing well at that--dirty dishes left on the table even after the next course was served, water glasses left empty
and this despite plenty of passes by the table
Each plate was missing something
Entrees were the fish/meat with a bland sauce and a small vegetable side
No starch, no second veg
Fish was overcooked
Rainbow carrots were just baby carrots
Things were either without salt or over salted
And portions were small--when they list pasta as a primi they mean it
Food is consistently under seasoned, and often flavorless
Squid ink ravioli with scallops had no seafood flavor; beef was unimaginative, and served with sauce reminiscent of Worcestershire
Couldnt stand the service long enough to make it to dessert
Crowded waiting area in entrance forced you to sweat out the wait for a table while standing over other diners
Though we waited 30 minutes for a table (on a Wednesday night, in summer, no less), no attempt was made to speed up the service by offering drinks/water
Inept service staff seemed to have crawled out of bed to come to work, and worked at a pace that would make a snail proud
Amendments to the menu werent clarified and communication between servers delayed our meal for nearly another half-hour
All in all, not worth the hype, until this restaurant proves its serious about pleasing its customers
On a recent visit to Falai, one thing struck us in the face after our 20 block walk on a 90 degree evening - no air conditioning! Don't mean to be picky, but when the wood oven faces the VERY small dining room, and when a six person check runs $650
00, it would be nice to cool off and enjoy the food
The food was adequate and well presented, but rather pricey for the limited selections and small quantities
The service, however, was excellent, and managed to salvage the evening
Noise level is much too high for small groups to enjoy conversation
Glad we went, probably never go back
Based largely on the Citysearch reviews my wife and I went with another couple last weekend
Dollar for dollar, Falai ranks among the best we have had, and exceeds many that are priced significantly higher
The service is wonderfully attentive without ever being overbearing
Dinner is delightfully punctuated with a plentiful breadbasket of multiple excellent breads that keeps coming as long as you want, and an amuse bouche, in our case carrot soup laced with ginger, that was delicious
We loved every appetizer and entree and the desserts were divine
Special favorites were the black ink pasta, served perfectly al dente in the shape of fish and filled with an incredible puree of roasted scallops, ricotta and asparagus
The polenta with chicken livers was the best of either item that we have ever had
Don't even think about missing the profiteroles! Thank you, Chef Falai, for an extraordinary NY original!
Could be trendy and attitudinal, but wasn't
The staff couldn't have been more accomodating and the waiter was adorable
He knew exactly what he could and should recommend, and what recommendations were best left to others (the wine, for example which both satisfied our taste and perfectly accompanied the food)
The portions were not huge, but actually human-sized and quite satisfying - no need to stuff yourselves unecessarily folks
The lovely pasta was obviously homemade as well as the assortment of heavenly breads
Try them all if you can
Due to the modest, European size of the portions, dessert is still a possiblity at the end of this meal - go for it - it's worth it
We arrived with a reservation for two but added a third at prime seating time
They were able to accommodate us and were great about it all
I'm not sure about the previous reviewer's experience, but our meal from start to finish lasted a full two and a half hours
I really felt like I was back in Italy
from the excellent wine, the great food, the friendly service
We went for dinner the other night to celebrate a friend's visit to NYC, and were rushed through the entire meal
The food, admittedly, was tasty (we came prepared for high prices and small portions) but I could not believe that with entrees, appetizers, and wine that the servers would rush us through each course
The waiter told us he would give us one minute to decide on our entrees, and we had two dishes taken from us before we were finished! We avoided dessert, not because we didn't want to try, but because the experience was so stressful
This type of service might be understandable if they explained when we made our reservation that they expected many other diners, or if the restaurant was crowded, but there were two empty tables the entire time we were there!
i have never written a review before, but i feel that this place did such an incredible job in terms of food and service that they deserve proper credit
i have a food allergy and they were very accomodating and helpful
the food was unbelievable
great price
it is a great place to meet up with a couple of friends for an enchanting dinner
I have beeen several times to eat in the White House that sig
Iacopo Falai started few months ago and everytime I have feel like at home ; the courtesy of the manager added to the good looking of the italian waiters and their professionality, make me came back to taste the amasing Pici with Musetto and the faboulouse Pork with cocoa nibs
I suggest to be there during the week , better for a date that could be unforgettable
If you're into refines food that still remails authentic to its roots this is the place for you
Everything from the bread to pasta to dessert is prepared by Chef Iacopo, to perfection
The ravioli with swis chard and sausage was delightful The beef medalions were perfectly done as was my passionfruit souffle
the profiteroles were little bites of heaven
Overall, a great addition to the Clinton St food crawl
I loved it! it was so romantic (everything was white!!! so impressive) and simply everything was perfect to me
Food, service, atmosphere, everything!! Greenpea papardelle w/ wild boar ragu was my favorite and panna cotta!! Bread and pastas are all home-made!! so good
For me, food tasted truly home-made italian
Can't wait to go back there
One thing, I don't think they open for lunch
A hip gem! Fine dining, warm casual atmosphere
Everything was carefully and beautifully presented + scrumptious
It's no secret that the two chefs, Matteo and Fabio, are serious about their food
For primi, we loved the fresh pappardelle w/ wild boar ragu, (licked our plates) + Polipetti, (octopus), meaty + grilled to perfection
(W/ the chef's compliments), fresh ricotta + sundried tomato parfait + ricotta and spinach creation, a temptation for a cheese lover like me! For entrees, Manzo, melt in your mouth beef medallions complemented by plump, sweet raisins + spinach
Try the juicy prawns presented atop potato slices + sliced zucchini with capers to pour a tasty consomme on top
Save room -best italian desserts, (if you like rum), the baba napoletana, a cake w/ raisins doused in rum w/ a side of homemade cream was irresistible + the fresh pannacotta, w/ delicate strawberry slices
A small group of us went to Falai for dinner to celebrate a birthday
I called ahead to ask if it would be fine to bring a candle to top a dessert
They kindly obliged and trumped my simple request by making the most elaborate dessert, turning off the lights in th entrie restaurant and singing happy birthday
I can't tell you how special and wonderfully delicious our experince was
The app
's, entrees and desserts were equally wonderful
What a welcome addition to NYC cuisine! Thanks
Amazing
The owner's passion about food is so obvious, not only in immaculate presentation of his dishes, but the amazing, fresh flavors in every dish
Everything is home made

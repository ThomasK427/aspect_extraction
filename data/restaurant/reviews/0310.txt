This is one of the worst bars in this city
I haven't been at a place in New York where I have received such poor service
The waitstaff is completely rude
They aggravated every person in the party I was with
When we complained to the manger, he walked away--not even offering to address our concerns
After waiting an hour for a table, they asked us to leave
The food was not worth the money, service was poor and we were being rushed to leave
We had a party of 16 people celebrating a birthday and we were forced to pick from the prefix menu limiting our choices
Without being able to finish our food, the staff kept on hovering over us to finish quickly
By the end of the night, we didn't even get our Morrocan deserts as part of the prefix menu because we had our birthday cake and we were suppose to leave by 10:00pm per the staff
Each person spent in the range of $70-$75
For that amount of money, I would've went to Houston, Peter Luger or Chupasscaria
All the naysayers probably went on a hot night that would be crowded anywhere that's worth going
Monday night was a great night to have dinner w/a group of 8 and the service was wonderful and patient and more than accomodating
Made for a fantastic birthday celebration
The food was unbelievably delicious - and filling - and the sangria was some of the best we've ever had
Tons of ambiance and different rooms and outdoor space to choose from as well as music, and yes, bellydancers
Atrocious service
only go if you want rude service, plates being whisked away even before you finish eating, not being given enough time to savor the place and order, and being asked to get up and leave as soon as you've finished eating
The food is average, but the rude waitstaff has made me add this place to the list of places I'd never visit again
ever
i was entertaining southern out-of-towners coming to NYC for the first time and couldn't decide what would be the most memorable experience
well 48 hrs later no one can stop raving about le souk
we had a party of 10, and the hostess did everything right to accommodate us on a busy saturday night
belly dancers danced around us what seemed like every 15 minutes; dj played incredible music; food was delicious and didn't stop coming
been there several times already but now certain i will continue when i need to entertain
A friend and I went for a late dinner one night and we had a great time
The food was good, you have to try the mussels and the chicken breast, but the ambiance can't be beat
We sat, ate, drank, and people watched all night
Very affordable too
I have rarely come across such rude staff
They barely let you enjoy the ambience; keep asking you for your order every 2 mins; try to pick up your plate a dozen times before you're done, and ask you to leave as soon as *they* think you're done
Emphasis seems to be on getting you to order and get out of there in record time
Food not that great either
I found this place through citysearch
I like looking for small places
The ambience is awesome
My food did not take a long time
Food was rich and delicate
Then again it was my first time eating moroccan food so i may be dead
If for anything, the ambience is worth it
Plus i did not even have a reservation and they seated
Great spot on Sunday and Monday night
This is when a lot of regulars come out
lots of good looking model types as well
Gets crowded, but what do you expect with a place that is probably 10 by 50? Music is a nice mix of everything from Aerosmith to James Brown to Metallica to disco to whatever else there is
I also hear the food is very good as well
Oh, and the parties usually go past 4 AM
was there last Monday til 530
A tip for you all: when the music stops hang around
wait a few minutes as the nonregulars leave, and join the party til late!
Excellent food, great music ambience
Relatively good value for food -- pri fixe menu @ $40 for 4 course meal
Drinks are $10 each
Mojitos are a speciality
The place was filled with people from every corner of the world
It was like wandering into some kind of international Istanbul caf
After we ate it transformed right before our eyes
Tables and chairs were carried out over the heads of the staff; the entire place erupted into to frenzied dancing
The Friday night dj with black glasses and ponytail was totally amazing
He mixed everything under the sun and the crowd exploded: Arabic, Brazilian, Indian, house, funk, hip-hop, drum and bass and reggae, he even played this amazing version of that Jewish folk song the Hava something? Total strangers were dancing arm in arm on the tables
I could not believe my eyes and I especially loved it when all these beautiful woman just jumped up on the bar and started belly dancing
I have been all over the world and never experienced anything like this place
I spent this past weekend in Manhattan with friends and had the pleasure of dining at Le Souk on Saturday night
The food was wonderful, our server was very nice and the music was such a wonderful change from the normal club-style beats
There is a lot of energy at this restaurant that becomes a sort of belly-dancing club at night
Be aware that the music is very loud
Also, dinner at Le Souk is an all night affair
Don't expect to eat and run in under an hour
This is a full evening experience
Our reservations were at 10:30 and we didn't finish eating (we ordered from the pre-set four course menu for our group of eight) until 1:00 in the morning
This is truly an evening long feast for the senses
Marcus, thank you for a perfect evening (and the champagne!!!)
Wow! I went last Saturday night for the first time
I will definitely be back
The music was great
There was no hiphop- it was incredible, mostly middle-eastern and european club music! We had appetizers and a few drinks- the service was pretty good, it was a little slow but they were very, very full so it was understandable and the food was delicious
The crowd was mostly young and attractive and there was no cover
I would definitely recommend LeSouk to anyone that wants to enjoy their night
I feel like I'm accross the world when steeping through the threshold of this EV club
The food is nice, not great but I've enjoyed the smaller, starter plates well enough
I come here for the drinks, the belly dancing and the club
The decor takes me on vaccation when I can't take one
Fun spot!
With a restaurant type bistro, a lounge like a marocaan casbah and a patio outside under a nice tent, I felt that this place has a lot to offer for an entertaining night
Food is very decent, I thought the branzino stuffed with coconut rice was to die for
Belly dancer male is really funny
I really liked the ambience and the decor
It's a little noisy in the lounge
If you want better food, go next door to Mamlouk on 4th street
But this is also quieter
Chez Saada on 1st street is very nice too, but pricey
went to le souk once for dinner, and have gone back just about every weekend since
LOVE IT
they have this appetizer tray that u should definetly order - the moroccan cigars and tunisian bread are amaaazing
and u can have it all while smoking a hookah! when ur thru with dinner, go back to the lounge area
it gets reeeeeally packed, but its good dancing
also, look for the male belly dancer!
After all the hype I've been hearing about this place, I had to make reservations on my visit from DC
This place met all of my expectations! Depsite the fact that I was very late for my table reservation, the people at Le Souk were very accomodating

It also makes a couple pieces of pizza very expensive
And stay away from the pies with lots of toppings - you'll pay dearly for any extra weight!
Finally someone cleaned up pizzerias! Great thin crust, with lots of choices for toppings
Very inventive, love the Nutella pizza
Brunch pizza with eggs and bacon is delicious
Fast delivery too
Pie has good pizza for slightly more than you would pay at a traditional pizzaria
The combos they have work well and the crust is thin and crispy but maybe a tiny bit on the dry side
The best thing about though is the fact that you can order any size piece you want
It's a great way to sample several without getting too stuffed
I went here with my friend and the service was dreadful, the waiter was more occupied with serving the larger tables
There is better Indian food in Long Island or Queens
Santoor or Akbar treat you a lot better and the food is soooo much better than at Indian City
I do not understand why it's rated #1, it certainly does not live up to its name
Indian City is definetly the best indian restaurant around
The best indian food around at a very reasonable price
The staff is wonderful and very friendly
I wouldnt suggest another indian restaurant when the best one is Indian City
Great job keep up the good work!!
A Loyal customer!
I went to this restaurant with a group of 20
We were seated promtly as soon as we got in
We had a great time that night
The food was great, the prices are inexpensive, and the atmosphere is unique
You have to try their Mango Fruit Punches, delicious!! I would highly recommend this restaurant to any person who loves Indian food
I have been to soo many indian restaurants and I must say, the food here at Indian City is amazing!!! They have the best buffet and there's always something special for that day
Try the chicken mahkni and get the onion kulcha's
Delicious tandoori chicken and great desserts!! The price is just topping on the cake, compared to other restaurants like Sitar Santoor, you will get your money's worth!!!
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant
Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens
The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret! Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home
very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele
all on Roosevelt Avenue!
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant)
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek)
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx
$6!!! All you have to do is hop on the 7 train for a couple of stops
The Scene It's difficult not to become a regular at this dimly-lit sliver of a storefront restaurant
The owners (who cook, serve and bus) are sincere schmoozers who cultivate a dinner-party vibe in their narrow, art-lined dining room
Like perfect hosts, they make introductions between the closely-arranged tables, then politely excuse themselves to the cubbyhole kitchen to prepare your meal
The Food The seasonal menu is inventive, thoughtfully prepared and entirely organic--and nothing costs more than $10
Everything's a hit on this seven-item international menu
There are blue cheese and honey-slathered roasted pears and a chunky pheasant terrine casserole, with a whiff of truffle oil under a baked brie crust
For main dishes, try gingery rabbit sausages with mustard or succulent, mango-glazed jerk duck leg confit
Order market-inspired specials: A recent riff on cassoulet yielded wild mushrooms, burstingly sweet beans and gamy merguez in an aromatic roux
If you didn't know about this place by word of mouth, I'll bet you'd never find it
At first I thought that was pretty silly, but now I realize why they have it like that
Ivo Lulu is a very well kept secret
The food is inexpensive and flavorful, the atmosphere is simple but comfortable, and they allow you to bring your own wine which they'll even chill for you! The menu is short, but I don't think you can have a bad meal here
Definately give Ivo Lulu a try!
Related to uptown A, Ivo Lulu is a downtown gem
Amidst a sea of restaurant snobbery, the owner, who also cooks all the food and has a resume that includes Chanterelle, is one of the most down to earth people with a magical spicy touch in the kitchen
Despite his less than humble culinary resume, the food and prices are an incredible bargain
Hidden, cozy and friendly, this place would be great for a date or just chilling with friends
Vive la France!
I've been to Ivo and Lulu twice and each time delights
The first time was on a cold February night, a good bottle of red wine, the cozy atmosphere, and delicious food made it perfect
The second time was last Saturday night
After a wonderful afternoon of wine tasting, I bought a good bottle of red and headed over to Ivo's
The smells coming from the kitchen make your mouth water from across the street
The pheasant pate with brie crust is out of this world and the duck in tangerine and peppercorn sauce is wonderful and surprising- a nice mix of sweet and spicy
The bill coming up to only $25 dollars makes it even better, plus drinking a bottle of wine that you chose, thus you know it will be good and cheaper than ordering a few glasses, makes this place a total winner
The service is attentive w/out being overbearing, the crowd is chill, and the music is great
It's nice to know that unassuming, great little places like this are still around
Run, don't walk to Ivo's!!!
I was there with friends last Thursday and had a really great dinner
They are so nice, the food was great - even better than great and we felt so welcome
Will definitely go there again
We wanted to be charmed but the food was disappointing
Appetizers were definite misses (baked avocado appetizer and smoked --unpleasantly so--mussels)
Sausage was horribly oversalted, duck with mango was OK
Gratin dauphinoise and salad were acceptable
A bargain perhaps (though some entrees are now $12 and $14), with BYOB, but a $25 bad meal is not really a bargain
A warm night with no air conditioning left the interior of the restaurant like a sauna
Very happy to leave and will not be returning
After reading all the reviews, I really wanted to go here with my friends for my birthday
I got there early on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, only to find out that they had a reserved party of 21 coming in and couldn't accommodate my group
So their no reservations policy isn't all that true
Definitely want to go back actually eat there and try it out, but didn't get to do it this time!
I wish we had discovered this place as soon as we moved to NYC! The food was fantastic! The goat cheese pair appetizer and grilled avocado appetizer was unlike anything I have had before
Each entree ordered from our table of four was delicious! The coconut flan dessert finished the dinner off perfectly! The prices are extremely reasonable but when you add in the BYOB benefit, this place can't be beat!
What a great place!! With a cozy atmosphere and absolutely delicious food, this hidden gem tucked into an off-the-beaten-path corner of Soho never lets us down
After 5 visits, we now begin planning our return even before the dessert reaches the table
Everyone we drag there with us confirms our opinion: this unassuming underdog wallops more pretentious and expensive restaurants in both price and taste
The only drawback I can name is the uncreative dipping oil for the table bread--but it's free
Go for the unrivalled though unusual roasted red pear with goat cheese to start, try either the duck breast or chicken breast as the main course, and end with the pineapple flan
Cash only, and no reservations--get there early!
This place is awesome
cheap
fun
great atmosphere
i had a great time EVERY time
Its awesome that places like this still exist in New York
food is excellent, and so is service, on the plus side you can bring your own wine bottle, thus slashing about $50 off of your final tab (impressing your date AND getting a healthy steady buzz for yourself)

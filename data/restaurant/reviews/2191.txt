Hapon has great fish, creative dishes and wonderful service
Also, they seem to really be doing a great job with the sake menu recently
This is a well hidden secret in the city but soon to become popular
They have the option of using brown rice instead of the regular sushi rice
More restaurants should do this for the healthier version of sushi that tastes wonderful
Fish was fresh, large portions and reasonably priced
Excellent
One of my favorite places in the city
the kimchi fried rice, monjyayaki and the omelets are really good
will keep going to try more of their menu
when eva i feel like mama's nihon cookin,,,,this iz da spot fo me
tho, raw fish iz ok,,try their yummy cooked apptz
be ready to study their lengthy menu
prices are very chills as well
i come here a lot for lunch dinner because its inexpensive, fast, and good
their regular menchanko (udon, $8
95) is really good
you can pay $0
50 more for the miso soup base instead of the regular one, but i find the miso one saltier and its not noticeably tastier either
their gyoza (dumplings, ~$4
50) are decent as well
the place is especially busy at lunch, so go during dinner if you want more attentive service
lunch specials like the ramen + rice bowl set are filling and cheap at less than $8
during the summer months, they serve chilled noodles which are quite refreshing
i tried their seafood salad for the first time today and its loaded with shrimp, squid, and scallops in a citrusy soy sauce quite tasty, but their noodles are still the way to go
Some seriously good Japanese noodles! It gets busy, but it's worth the wait!
great noodle soups, summer special cold chukka ramen is quite refreshing

Ok, I've been here a few times now and the food is consistent, hot and you get what you pay for
The sevrice is OK, but not outstanding - it did take more than 5 minutes to get a refill on my coke which they then had the audacity to charge for when I was only given half a coke in the first place - you have been warned!
Yeah, our lunch was kinda eh
You know
eh
Most everything was satisfactory -- the food, the price ($33 for two), the experience -- but then again, I'm easily satisfied
However, I just don't understand how some establishments in this town get away with some of the servers they employ
Geesh
She was dreadful
I don't think we saw her from the time she took our order to the time she gave us our check
Accomplices who were in on her crap delivered our food
And geez, what does it take to get another drink? And like I said, I'm easily satisfied
I don't know, y'all can try it out for yourselves, but I know there are better dining opportunities out there
In Short This sprawling, bilevel extravaganza, with its white tile floor, glistening shellfish displays, deco light fixtures and bargeload of piscine art around the oval bar, is a cheerful, clamorous spot for quick drinks or a full meal
The menu offers every fish preparation imaginable: chowders, gravlax, fried shrimp, and sauteed fish in a variety of sauces are just the tip of the iceberg
The key lime pie is a house favorite
A group of co-workers and I decided to hit Docks for after work drinks since we knew the restaurant had a huge bar with plenty of stools
But their nosy bartender kept interupting our conversations and interjected weird comments about politics
Bro, stick to making drinks or telling jokes if your patrons ASK
I will probably go back, but only for a seafood dinner, not for drinks at the bar
for a spur of the moment location, our experience was pleasent - knew nothing of the place but were surprised by the good food and portions - a great place for couples and kids-would do again
6
5 Rating? Ridiculous
I've been to this restaurant about 3,4 times this past year, with my most recent visit being in Nov '04
The oysters and fish are fresh and I've had no problems with service in the past
Their selection of wines is more than enough and the atmosphere is great
Plus, this restaurant isn't usually packed every night due to probably it's location (near Grand Central) and at night, there isn't much foot traffic around it
All in all, this is a great restaurant for some good food and a romantic date
Give it a chance
I don't understand why this place doesn't have a much higher rating
The food was great and they offer late night dining, which is hard to come by in the Murray Hill area
I will definitely be going back there
If you are in to eating on top of people this place is for you
This place is too crowded, no elbow room
The food is average at best, if you must go, then request the seafood broiled, b/c if requested fried it tastes and looks like a frozen microwave dinner
Looking for good seafood try el quijote
What a wonderful meal! The bad reviews must be bogus or based on an isolated incident
I'm glad I didn't pay attention to them or I would have missed a great dinner out
The food was wonderful and the service from the entire staff was spectacular, too
And our waitress had a VERY thorough knowledge of the menu
Everything was simple enough to avoid pretention yet still interesting enough to make it fun
Food quality is hugely important with seafood and Docks had nothing but the best: fresh, flavorful and pleasing to the eye
This was a wonderful dining experience!
I would not recommend this restaurant at all
Not only were all the specials unavailable when we sat down at 6 pm and the food an hour late, but it was cooked wrong and the managers were very rude when learning about our situation
It also took 20 minutes to get refills on our drinks
New York City has many great restaurants and a few bad ones
This one belongs at the very bottom of the bad list
Two couples sitting around us were also complaining about their dining experience that night
It wasn't enough that we waited over an hour for our food
once it came out the waiter mistakenly gave it to the table next to us
After they were done poking and prodding our food, the waiter took it right from their table and tried to give it to us
When we asked to have our food re-cooked, it emerged from the kitched 2 minutes later in an attempt to pass it off as totally differen dishes
Once we summoned the manager, we were accused of exaggerating the situation and asked to not return to the restaurant
Haven't these people heard of customer service??? I would not recommed this restaurant to anyone -- steer clear!
Table was ready for uour party of 10
The service was very good throughout
Half the specials were no longer available
Shrimp cocktail included 4 big shrimp but at $12
50 was too expensive
They had an appetizer, truffled potato salad with caviar cream that i ordered
What I got was 4 finglerling potatoes cut in half, some cream mixture on the side with enough caviar to make it visible and nary a truffle in sight
And for $7
50, it was the rip-off of the nite
Two pound lobsters were $36
We had 2 lb lobster the week before at Il Quixote on 23rd street, just as good, for $27
The clams and oysters were fresh and served properly iced
For cocktail sauce you get ketchup
Make sure you ask for the horseradish and tabasco to mix your own
A pleasant enough place with decent seafood priced way to high
I go here at LEAST 3 times a week for breakfast and at LEAST 2 times a week for lunch
I absolutely LOVE their paninis

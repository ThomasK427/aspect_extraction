The place wasn't bad at all--actually pretty good
I had the restaurant week prix fixe special: hamachi ceviche, some kind of salmon, and flan
Tried someone elses skirt steak--tasty
No major issues with seating party of 5 w/reservations
However, had drink at bar before dinner and they overcharged us
We were looking for good mexican food that wasn't just your run of the mill mexican food
We had heard about a few places but we wanted something that was fun and good quality
After a few friends suggestions, we went to Maya
It was a little crowded at the door, but had great energy and color
We waited about 10 minutesf for a reservation, but it was well worth it
They had this great pineapple flavored margarita, I swear it must be the best one I ever had
I'm not much of a foodie, but my boyfriend is a chef, and he loved all the creative flavors in those dishes
Try the the truffle oil in the tamal
Ask for Claudia, she's the tall one
Drove down from upstate, Wanting to try an upscale mexican restaurant during restaurant week
It was a choice between Dos caminos and Maya
Maya had a higher Zagatz rating so we opted for Maya
Ended up NOT choosing the fixed price menu
It was way to limited and for a few dollars more, girlfriend and i opted for what we would prefer
Price would have been about the same except we were conned into purchasing bottled water
Even though friendly and efficient, we couldn't quite understand the broken English spoken by the waiter
Therefore the $7 bottle of water
Food was tastefully prepared
However, do not come hungry and order the Pork dish
Very skimpy with the serving
Have had just as good food at less expensive Mexican restaurants found in Central Manhattan
If you only have time for one Mexican restaurant in NYC, try another
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants, Maya has great food, a energetic atmosphere (without being too noisy for conversation)
The service is also great
I recommend the tamal al chipotle (a chicken tamale) appetizer, as well as the langosta y camarones (lobster and shrimp) and the costillas de cordero (grilled lamb chops) entrees
And all the margaritas I've had so far have been amazing here! It's a bit on the expensive side, but a great way to splurge for a night in a trendy restaurant without snobby attitude
THis open and spacious restauarant has a long menu of some unique dishes
I had a great pork dish and a chcoclaty dessert
The margharitas were very tasty and overall it was a good experience
tried twice
both times the food was average
certainly no match for Rosa's, and less tasty than Dos Caminos too
let's face it, it's tough finding good mexican in this city
Very good water glass refilling though!! Every time I took a sip, it got refilled
I tried just making motions toward the water glass, and he would react
He's fast!!
If you want Mexican food, go to another restaurant
The food was definitely not worthy of being called Mexican food
The tortillas were hard tasted as they had been frozed then warmed for serving
The mole was served over chicken that was too dry
and so on
At least, the staff was nice
Great food, great atmosphere, interesting presentation
The service was very attentive and prompt
We had a great experience there
I would go back!
Great mole poblano, great chipotle prawns, fun atmosphere, effective margaritas (not chintzy on the tequila!)
Try the Mayapolitan - better than a cosmo for sure
Friendly hostess, efficient service
The Mexican hot chocolate (I think it is called Chocolate de Abuelita or similar) is to die for
I am a Mexican food snob and think the only good Mexican food is made in Mexico or select locations in Southern California and I thought this place was great for high-end stuff
Don't expect down-and-dirty old school Mexican food though
Hostess was extremely accommodating when we arrived an hour early for our reservation
It's interesting to see negative ratings on a place that I had such a great experience with
The decor is lovely, the food was scruptious, the service was great - prompt, not pushy
I was with family that are super tough customers - and they concurred
The lambchops were phenomenal, as were the goat cheese crepes for dessert
And don't miss the guacamole!!
The food is creative and wonderful
The best (we had a lot of seafood) Mexican I've had- even better than Rosa Mexicano
Unfortunately, it is a bit loud inside
I had reservations yet the hostess searched for my name for 15 minutes
We ordered drinks at the bar but were seated before we received them
The bar tender told me canceling the order wouldnt be a problem, yet 15 minutes after having ordered drinks at our dinner table, she came over with those we had ordered and a bill
Seated at a table so close to two other couples that if we had lifted our elbows we would have had to apologize, we also had to deal with four drinks on our table
The food arrived and mine was dreadful
My fianc, who eats anything, couldnt touch it
Upon the waiter noticing that I had only had one bite of my food, he cleared it from the table
He took off the charge of one drink to compensate
Please, I beg you: Dont waist your time or money
Good Food
Not your typical Mexican Restaurant
Creative Mexican dishes that are not so typical in Mexico
It is worth a try if you are in the mood to try new dishe
Some dishes can be a little expensive
Definetly fine Mexican cuisine and not your mom and dad mexican restaurant
I think the dishes were more americanize and not as authentic
The food was bad, the service was bad
The only thing that was good was the Margaritas
Better off going to a traditional Mexican restaurant and saving $60
I went to Maya this past Friday night
I usually go to Mex Rosa's on 60th 1st but wanted to try something different
I had a 8:45 reservation and wasn't seated until 9:20
The place was very crowded usually it is a good indication that the food would be worth the delay
The oyster appetizer was very flavorful as well as the shrimp entree however is was cold
This is certainly not the best Mexican I've ever had
I was very disappointed with the guacamole
It wasn't made tableside like Mexicano Rosa's and not as tasty
Maybe it was a off night but I feel too expensive to hope for a better experience the 2nd time
Sorry I'll stick with Rosa's! Aprilann
delicious! i went late night on a tuesday and the entire waitstaff was professional and perfectly at hand
the food was gourmet and beautifully presented - not to mention the taste was out of this world
prices were totally reasonable
it was small and romantic - great for a date
my suggestions would be this sweet corn soup for your appetizer and the filet mignon entree - they are very descriptive with their ingredients but dont let that scare you - whatever it is they put in all mixes up into one fabulous dish! although gourmet - it is perfectly propotioned so you leave pleasantly plump! try a margarita too - very smooth

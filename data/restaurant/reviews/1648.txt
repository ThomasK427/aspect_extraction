I'm biased, since I proposed to my wife there, but I absolutely love this restaurant
The food is great, and the service is spectacular
Super friendly and helpful waiters that treated us like kings, and even treated us to champagne when my wife said yes
I highly recommend it
We walked into Il Cantinori on a beautiful Friday night when the city was packed and we were starving
We walked down Park, through Union Square and not one restaurant could seat us
We stopped into Il Cantinori and even though they were crowded, they sat us
The food was excellent, the wine was perfect and the service could not have been more attentive
I even asked the waiter what kind of coffee they served because it was so good and they brought me a package to take home
With that kind of attention in a city full of snotty waiters, we will definitely make a point to go there more often
we went to cantinori as it came highly recommended by three friends, the praise may have been for the ambience but the food was a big let down
it is not tuscan cuisine as it labels itself
the chicken was hard, the meats unoriginal and the desserts a complete miss
not recommended at all if you think you are going to eat tuscan food
After hearing so much about this restaurant, I was eager to check it out
We went to Il Cantinori to celebrate a friends birthday
Although the restaurant has a nice ambience, the food left much to be desired
The calamari and tomato appetizer was just OK -- nothing to write home about
I ordered tuna steak (medium rare) for dinner
The tuna was served extrememely well done and bordering on indedible
Since I was with a large group, I didn't send it back
Desserts were nothing to get excited about either
All things considered, I doubt I will be rushing back
Expectations were high after a number of recommendations
Too high
The meal got off to an ominous start when the birthday girl was not given her glass of champagne as ordered
Redemption arrived with delicious breads and excellent starters of grilled squid and clams in pesto
I made an unwise choice in my main of pan-seared rib-eye steak which was not to my taste, though the lamb was apparently much better
For a high-end restaurant it was surprisingly lax in the detail; the service was erratic with a cast of thousands, whilst we were grossly over-charged on the bill with a wine so expensive it should have been in Christies
Overall, something of a curate's egg - good in parts
One of the city's best italian restaurants, if not one of the best restaurants overall
Went there once it certainly isn't the last time
Expensive, but worth it
The service, ambience, and food epitomize class
Good portion size, too
The carbonara pasta (I'm still dreaming about it!) is a nonpareil, and the special of the day seared tuna (accompanied by the tastiest haricot verts) were divine
The only disapointment was the tiramisu: delectable top half, soggy cardboard bottom
Perfect for a date or mature group of 10
Not great, not bad
Pretty standard
Decent service, decent food
If you're used to high caliber cuisine, this is just another joint and won't wow you, but won't dissapoint either
In Short On a good day, this tiny East Village storefront goes through more than 1,000 pounds of potatoes
Folks line up for a cone filled with fries and loaded up with one or two of the 26 toppings
Authentically Belgian, the fries here are hand-cut and twice-fried, but the dippings span the globe: roasted garlic mayonnaise, satay peanut sauce and the complimentary house-special mayonnaise, ketchup and raw onions
Hi wow
I saw Pommes Frites featured on the Food Channel a couple years ago and happened to walk by it while with a friend going to get sushi
Naturally, I HAD to try them, and WOOOOOOW
The fries are absolutely amaaaaazing and the sauce selection is enormous
The pesto mayo and sun-dried tomato mayo are my favorites
The fries are perfectly cooked so they're nice and crunchy on the outside but soft and hot on the inside
PERFECT! Definitely bring friends along with you though, as the small size is still HUGE
If so, you will enjoy Pomme frites
They're good for all occasions: hungover breakfast cures, late-night drinking snacks, having a beer while you're eating them


hm
I need to drink less
Anyway, the place has great fries and a horde of good sauces
Try 'em all!
I heard about this place for some time---so i had to go try it
I'm going to say that the fries tasted like regular fries---however, the variety of sauces that you get to choose made it really good
I am going to go back and try to other sauces
The wasabi-mayo and cheese (made it taste like cheese fries) were gooooood
This place is a great way to start your day in manhatten, lots of carbs to give you energy all day, Try getting the sauces layered
Good Deal Great taste!!
The Fries are reallllllllllllly good
I got fooled into buying 2 sauces though
But still a good value if you don get stuck with teeny fries
You can spend $200 on a dinner in NYC easily
Try spending $6 on an out of this world meal
at Pommes Frites
Sauces galore and quick service
There is not a line of 5 - 6 people for nothing
yummy late night nosh
excellent with grey's papaya hot dogs =)
This taste just like the ones in Amsterdam
Even the mayo is the same
Try the peanut satay sauce
I have to say, despite the somewhat brusque nature of the tall, bald Belgian guy behind the counter who likes to argue with me about the price of his soda (or maybe because of it,) I just cannot get enough of this place
Other fries become pointless calories in light of these spectacular creations
It's tiny, so don't expect to sit down at the meager seating- perhaps take it to the park nearby to eat
It has an astounding variety of sauces, something like 40
It's a treat to watch the staff make each batch freshly
Great service, great fries and excellent sauces
I've been several times and love them!
I LOVE this place! The fries were amazing, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside
It was piping hot and nice and thick
What made it especially amazing was the sauces
I tried the mango chutney but didn't find that particularly special
My friends and I ended up sharing a medium sized cone of fries with the sundried tomatoe sauce
That was delicious
HOWEVER, what is even better is the smoked eggplant sauce
That was so delicious
Don't be afraid to try the different sauces--you never know what you would find
The employees were very welcoming and overwhelming with samples
The fries were excellent and filling as well
The only thing I didn't like was the $1
25 can of soda
Be prepared to eat and run because seating is limited

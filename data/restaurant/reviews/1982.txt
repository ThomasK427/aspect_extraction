I just can't say enough about the service and the food
Starting with Chris who took my reservation and Ben who was my waiter,I and my party were made to feel very much as members of a large family
The food was GREAT and the prices were very reasonable
This was my first time to visit this restaurant,even though I lived in NYC for a long period of time
There is no doubt that I will be going back many more times in the future

I really don't understand why this place gets any bad reviews!   I went with a large group (there was 15 of us) and we were seated promptly, served quickly and the waiter was ontop of everything
We ordered the family style dishes and everything was incredible (except for the roasted peppers but I am not a red pepper fan)
This place has the best tortillini by far of any I have tried
It's not a fancy restaurant and they don't have a selection of wine but the food makes up for any bad points
Went for dinner on saturday for my boyfriend bithday and had a horrible time
The place was the size of my bathroom
people packed like sardines
The food was drenched in oil and cream, accompanied by an imitation wine i never heard of
The waitstaff was unfriendly and rude
The only time our waiter assisted us was when i recieved a dirty plate
After a wonderful dinner follwed with a no tip for the tab, the waiter chases up for one
For what reason they got $90 for slops, is he kidding
Well i guess this was th first and last time for us
Someone had recommended La Mela to us, so we went there for lunch while vacationing in NY
The waiters were nice enough and just started bringing food family style, no need for menus here
We had a plate of caprese and another plate of various appetizers, followed by a plate of mixed pasta
We were full from the pasta, so we skipped the meat course and had desert, which was underwhelming
So we finally get the bill, and it came to $130 for the 4 of us! I couldn't believe how much they had charged us, esp with every other restaurant in Little Italy charging $15-$20 a person for a 3 course lunch
And you know what--the food wasn't even that good! Do yourself a favor and skip La Mela when you visit Little Italy, there are much better restaurants that don't try to rip off the tourists!
I hosted a dinner party for a good friend last night at La Mela
Apparently, this is the place for fun, laid-back group dining as there were innumerable large parties already sat in the massive restaurant
Our party of 14 was sat immediately and the waiter brought over bottles of wine and bread
Service was relatively quick; portions were monstrously huge
We started off with an appetizer of fresh mozz, tomatoes, and basil
Our antipasti consisted of stuffed mushrooms, fried cheese, roasted red peppers, and asparagus
Finally, our pasta meal had three varieties
Our table received two platters of each course and had multiple doggy bags to bring home
The wine never stopped flowing and the food was satisfactory
If you're looking for fabulous dining, skip La Mela
However, if you want simple Italian food in large quantities in a fun environment, this place is ideal!
The food was terrible, I had the chicken Scarp and all I got was a plate full of chicken that looked like I was eating in Chinatown
The garlic in the chicken was mushy and the taste was hardly identifiable
It came with no pasta
Who goes out for Italian food and doesn't eat pasta? The waiter was rude and it took several attempts to get his attention
I noticed that he treated his other customers the same way
We were repulsed by this meal and will go back to our favorite restaurant in Little Italy
for its excellent food and service
Also, there was an annoying performer with a guitar that we wished would shut up so we could enjoy our meal and have a conversation
First the restaurant is a loud, extremly crowded, bright, food sucks and the service was the worst I have ever experienced in my 15 years of living in NY
The owner came out and started going into a psycho rage cause one person out of 3 didnt want to order food even though we bought wine already
It was quite scary and completely uncalled for and ruined our dinner
I have been to many restaurants in little italy and all had nice professional friendly staff
Stay away from this one anywhere is better than here
This place was so much fun to go to- no matter if you are with your husband, your kids, your friends or your significant other
The staff was polite (and cute nonetheless) - never rushed us through our dinner and the food was soooo delicious! Even though it was very busy last Sat night, the employees were friendly and you could tell that it was busy because it was so popular and not due to poor managment
The man working the door (red hair)-very funny and warming
The prices were great and my boyfriend wasn't hungry at the end of the meal- which was a big, no a HUGE surprise!
This is absolutely one restaurant we highly reccommend
Tommy Red made our visit to La Mela an expeirience we will never forget
The food was delicious and the service made us feel as if we were in our Nanna's kitchen
We will definitely vist La Mela again!
nice people who run this place but the food is average at best and very noisy which was not a surprise and is part of the atmosphere
For the price, it was not worth it at all
This is my all time favorite restaurant in the world!!! The food is phenomenal!! I don't know about you but food is why I go out to eat
Not for the wine, not for the decor, and not for any other reson but to eat a great meal
While some people may be put off by the ambience for me it feels like home!! If you want a quiet place with a long wine list, don't go
But if you want great food and plenty of it, run don't walk to La Mela!!
I used to go to La Mela all the time when I lived in Jersey
The food is great, and for NYC, an excellent price
It's a loud, crowded, fun place, not the place to go for high-brow ambience
But the gnocchi is awesome, the stuffed mushrooms amazing
It's like you're at your Italian grandmother's for a family party
Afterward, stroll Little Italy for a pastry, or head down a few blocks into Chinatown to the Chinese Ice Cream Factory for red bean or ginger ice cream
This is real italian
not Olive Garden
The vegetables are wonderful, the wine is fantastic, and the atmosphere is relaxed and casual
No need for a menu
they know what to do
Go to have fun and sample some family style Italian
I was kind of turned off by the greeter's used-car-salesman pitch, but we decided to give La Mela a try anyway
Maybe I just don't know Italian food, but all in all I wasn't too impressed by the food
They sold us the package which they offer to everyone for about $17
I can't imagine the profit they must make off of this since all the dishes probably just come out of a huge vat in the backroom
At any rate, my girlfriend loved the pasta though I thought it was just okay(I wish I had gotten the meat option
there was a meat option, right??)
There were some savory dishes among the appetizers though
I love cheese, but is mozzarela supposed to be so tasteless (on the tomato/mozz/basil)? All in all, I'd wish we had sampled Little Italy elsewhere
I think that despite the lousy atmosphere there is no place I've ever eaten before that compares to their food,it is excellent and the service is right on time
Truly a treat for anyones tastebuds!!!!!!!
La Mela is perfect for a Summer night
Sit outside in the front or in the backyard and enjoy the waiters who flirt with all the women
La Mela is great for people watching and it's a great place to have fun with friends, family, or a significant other
The pasta is delicious
Extremely fresh
the gnocchi is a knock-out
Plus the bill was much lower than I expected
The cappuccino put me off at first because it's topped w/ whipped cream, but it's a fun indulgent treat reminiscent of hot chocolate
Mangia, Mangia!
Dined here for a birthday party and had lots of fun! The food courses just keep coming out just like at my Italian bf's house
All family style with large platters for everyone to help themselves
The desserts were heavenly! Love the gelati and cheesecake! The video monitors on the wall give you a glimpse of the other diners in the 3 rooms
Funny waitstaff
They charge you for how much wine you drink from the large bottles they set out infront of you
Expect to pay about $50 per person

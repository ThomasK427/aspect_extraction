Good bars in the area for a drink while waiting
Excellent for lunch, too
And take-out available
)
The best seafood and the best service to boot! So worth the wait
Although the size and atmosphere kind of makes the place, it would be nice if it was bigger
The bar area is fun to snack on some yummy seafood
The gazpacho with grilled shrimp was delish and of course the lobster roll kicked butt!!  I have to agree with some of the other reviews about service(ok) and price(too high)
In one word: EXTRAORDINARY
Fight back against Manhattan's ferocious heat humidity with Mary's impeccably fresh, reasonably priced seafood: Cool down with splendid raw oysters fine ice-cold wine or tap beer; enjoy summer's garden delights with a bracing gazpacho or yellow tomato salad nestled among crunchy sweat peas; give in to addictive salt crusted shrimp
But don't stop with starters: you can't miss with grilled soft shell crabs (a welcome change from the standard sauteed version); luscious seared Diver scallops; heavenly pan roasted Wild Atlantic Bass; wonderfully simple whole grilled Mediterranean fish; or the celebrated lobster roll
Side dishes excel, especially five bean salad grilled corn
Finally, indulge in classic warm weather delights: strawberry shortcake banana pudding will make you love summer all over again
[Hint: don't be afraid of long lines -- leave your mobile number with the hostess enjoy a drink down the block

I can't wait to go back next time I'm in New York
Had the lobster knuckles and the po' boy sandwich
tasted a friend's pot pie
It's a fun, down-home but sleek place to get your hands dirty eating good, affordable food
Oceans of iced tea, a bowl of lightly spicy Florida conch chowder, crunchy, salty shells-on fried shrimp
mmmmm
The shrimp were excellent, even if you do get the odd spiky,  cartilaginous mouth-poke from the thin shells
Shrimp came with a mound of crunchy, creamy slaw
It being a hot day, I didn't have the appetite to tackle the massive-looking lobster roll, but I'll be back to try it when those Maine cravings beckon
Service (I sat at the counter) was minimal (had to ask for bread) but polite
In Short The original opened as a speakeasy in 1926, and the other locations retain much of that atmosphere, with deep velvet benches and wooden tables topped with white tablecloths
Alongside the USDA prime dry-cut steaks, the menu features standard steakhouse fare: appetizers like shrimp cocktail, fresh oysters and clams, an array of salads, soups, pastas and vegetable sides, and non-steak entrees like lamb, veal and pork chops, lobster and more
I have been hearing a lot about Frankie Johnnie's and decided to check it out
Dinner was fabulous - from the bread to the sirloin to everything in between
As a waitress, I am always keen to the quality of service when I dine out
It was impeccable, even though it was incredibly busy (I went on a Friday night)
I couldn't have done it better myself! I will defintely be back
My cousins were in town from Oklahoma and I wanted to show them a night out in the Big City
So, Broadway was the obvious first choice
I decided to take them to Frankie and Johnnies for dinner - as I had been hearing so much about it lately
The place is gorgeous! I love how they kept it authentic, with John Barrymore's original fireplace and wood floors
And the night just kept getting better! Everything we had was cooked to perfection - even the bread was amazing! I had the crabcakes and filet, the best I've had in NYC
This place is a hidden treasure! We then got a limo to the show, which really topped off the night and totally impressed my family
I loved it, they loved it - all around a great night!
I recently came to NY on business
I have been to a good share of NYC steakhouses in my day, but Frankie Johnnie's take the cake
The best sirloin I've ever had - it was cooked to perfection
Everything was delicious, the crabcakes and the lyonnaise potatoes were my favorite - besides the steak, of course
Our server was attentive, yet not too pushy and I didn't feel rushed, which I often do when I come to NY
Next time I'm in town, I will make sure to eat here again
Huge steaks that taste terrific and served by a professional waitstaff
The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and we didn't feel rushed with our dinner
We told the staff we were going to the theatre and they offered us a complimentary limo
Wow
that toppped off a great dinner
Thank you Frankie Johnnie's
I'll be back soon
My partner and I made a lovely reservation at the restaurant
We entered and we were seated upstairs
The place was romantic because they had many candles lit and the mood was right
We ordered wine and jumbo shrimp to start
We sat, drank, and ate shrimp, when suddenly! One of the waiters decided to crawl over to where my partner was sitting and grabbed a linen napkin from our table, you don't want to know what he did with it, honestly you don't want to know
He tried to grab a HUGE FREAKING WATERBUG that was crawling on the wall behind my partner
He had the nerve to ask us if we wanted to be seated at another table because he didn't capture the waterbug in the napkin he DROPPED IT on our seats where we were seated
I was so grossed out that I said we're out of here, so we cancelled our dinner and told them thanks but no thanks
We were offered a ride in a limo to our hotel but we declined
Our romantic evening out turned into a night out at Apple Bees
Thanks Frankie and Johnny's for ruining our night!
It's great food, tasty, delicious, what else
It's great service also, elegant waiter, promising service
One thinks, a little overprice
I came one time, I don't think yet to come again
The steak is good, but nothing special, almost as regular steak house
Been to both w37th and w45th and while 37th is roomier, 45th was an old speakeasy and has a great charm
Lots of autographed pieces (Joel Grey to Jack Webb)
Small tight
Lyonesse potatoes are a treat
Service, is very attentive in both without being intrusive
45th is walkable to virtually all theatres as long as it is not raining
If you like sirloin, this is the place
Big, juicy, and incredibly consistent
Bring an appetite becaue it is hard to carry a doggie bag to the theatre
37th is great if you want a great meal before an event at the Garden
Can't go wrong either way
If you complain about the quality of the beef here, no place will satisfy you
This place is tremendous: steaks, and appetizers were fantastic
Kudos, kudos, kudos
I could not have asked for a better meal
And the bread they had in the basket was delic (pronounced delish)
There was a lively atmosphere down by the bar with everyone watching the Yankee game
Definitely a cool spot to go to after work
No problem with the service, either
I heard so much about this place so I went on a Friday evening
The service was very good
I ordered a sirloin steak
I wasn't crazy about it at all
It was too fatty
I have had a better steak at Charlie Browns
The creamed spinach was like soup
The potatoes were great though
Dessert was key lime pie and was good and the coffee was so so at $3
50 a cup
The best part was when we were leaving they asked if we needed the free limo service somewhere in the city as long as we tipped the driver
That was cool
I would go back but I would try something different

the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!! plus, i am allergic to rice, and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye! and the waiter suggested a perfect sake!! absolutely fabulous!!!
Why is it that (almost) every good review is by anonymous? I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place
I have been to this place, folks and it is BAD
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that's half-way decent
I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment
Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable
DONOT GO!
Now that Blue Ribbon Sushi has cut back the size of their sushi to the traditional bite sized piece it is easily the best place we have ever been
I live for the Honoo Platter and Horse Mackerel Sashimi
After reading some reviews I saw here, I decided to give this place a try
I went on a Monday, well known as the worst sushi day of the week
Let me gather myself here
I had 3 dishes
The best bowl of Miso soup I've ever had, you mix in the amount of Miso paste you want, to your ideal of the right amount of miso taste, then I had a salad made of different types of Daikon radishes with a delicious sauce
My entree was a platter of different types of rolles called Honoo, some had lobster meat, while others were salmon toro, tuna toro and scallops
Some were Gunkan, and one was covered in roe
It was the single best dish I have ever had
To drink I had the Hibiscus Iced Tea, and the price was not nearly as high as I would have expected
Unlike any other restaurant I have ever been to
I have been to Blue Ribbon Sushi at least 75 times and have never ordered the same dish twice, that's how awesome the menu is
The Daikon salad, Chuwan Mushi, Tiger Eye, Mushroom salad, Honoo Platter, the best Dragon Roll period
I could go on and on and on
Perfect sized pieces, not like Yama, when you have to cut them in half, each pice can be eaten with one bite, but larger than those blatant rip offs!  My last meal on Earth:  Red Miso Soup  Chuwan Mushi  Sashimi Platter  Salmon Toro  Green Tea Crem'Brule  Perfection !
Blue Ribbon Sushi has a menu that contains by far the best appetizers of any Sushi restaurant anywhere
Sushi/Sashimi is listed by the Ocean it's found in, and which season it is available
The Sushi/Sashimi is traditional, yet served a bit larger since Americans have larger appetites due to the fact that they do more work than anyone else
The rolls are New Age sushi, inventive, and delicious, using many forms of this cuisine
The variety of fish dwarfs that of any place in NYC by close to a dozen varieties
The Chefs are masters, and if you must wait 3 hours to get a table, then you must
No place on the East coast can compare to Blue Ribbon Sushi in any manner
This was an ok sushi place
I noted absolutely nothing special except for the ridiculously long wait, the pretentious crowd, and the obnoxious prices
The food, which has been trumpeted as among the best Japanese cuisine in the city was mediocre at best
The wait staff was inattentive and slow
I have no idea why this place is so popular
Sushi Damo at 58th between 9th and 8th has MUCH better sushi, much cooler atmosphere, no waits, and more reasonable prices
Maybe Blue Ribbon can learn a thing or two from them
I loved this place
even with the 1
5 hour wait!  The sushi is so fresh and amazing! The warm squid with smoked salmon was delicious!  The atmosphere is crowded yet able to maintain a zen-like nature
and at least they take your cell number and call you when your table is ready so you can leave to go to another place for a bit
There is not a bar or much of a scene to hang out in prior to dinner while you wait
They will serve drinks to you while you sit on the hard wooden benches if you want
After a 4 year break in eating at Blue Ribbon Sushi - I live in San Francisco - my last trip was geared around comparing the sushi at Blue Ribbon to Marina Sushi in SF
My critique - both are amazing
I have two favorite sushi restaurants - one on each coast
Everyone who loves sushi knows Blue Ribbon is the best in the United States, but you should also try their appetizers
Chuwan Mushi is so freaking good in the winter time that I leave my beat and pick one up 30 times a year, and try the Wasabi Shumai, for real lovers of Wasabi
Don't stop there, sashimi is also fruit and meat and the tataki (steak) is incredible! Get the Miso soup, and mix in the amount of Miso paste that you want,have it with the Hibiskus Iced Tea
Sure, you can sit back and watch the celebrites pour in, or sit at the bar, and watch true masters create old world sushi, and new world rolls
There is nothing better
A sushi-fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner
6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um)
As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection
Their specialty rolls are impressive, though I can't remember what we had
Great selection of sakes
Green tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it
It isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time
The sushi here is delicious! They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific
I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good
My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger
The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese
The crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old
The service was courteous and attentive
fish is always so fresh
they always offer different and fresh selections daily
fish is soft and tender but the waits are long, and i mean LONG!
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the fish is the freshest and the service is superb
Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well
The nicest waiters in town
This place is always has a waiting list
Good thing is you don't have to stand in the line to wait, you can leave your cell phone number and they will call you when your table is about ready
The fish is very fresh and the sushi masters are very creative
My favorite dish is the $100 Sampler
The atmosphere is nice, good for friends to get together
Couples fine but there are better places for dating
This is a very busy restaurant, so don't expect a Ten-Point Service
Best Sushi in town
Have gone to all the top places
Everything you want and more, very fresh
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready
One of the best Sushi place in town
The house special roll is really good
On weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours
However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone
The food here is great; the fish is generally fresh
decor is cozy and intimate with dark wood tones and bamboo accents
my friend and i had their eel roll, sashimi deluxe, dynamite appetizer and soft shell crab roll
the dynamite appetizer was a lot lighter and purer tasting than that made in most restaurants
i still like the overall fish sashimi and cuts at tomoe more, but blue ribbon definitely serves out a good solid japanese meal
For die-hard sushi lover like me, weekly Sashimi ritual is a must for life
We try to get seats two weeks ago on a weekday, waiting time is one and half hour
I gave up, and went to NOBU instead
With all the hypes on Citysearch and Zegat, I guess it should be Great! Finally, we got in last night
The place is OK, if you combine service, ambience, and open for late dinner
Food is mediocre
The Sashimi is not the freshest, and most of the specials are not noteworthy
Desert is amazing, I can give you that, but thats not the reasons I went
Certainly don't make you go WOW

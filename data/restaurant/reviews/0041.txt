So cute! Go inside and the great service starts at the door
They let us sit even though we only had 2 out of a party of 4 - the restaurant was packed but they honor reservations (unlike a lot of restaurants)
The gnocci is made fresh daily, and tastes so light
They mix is with pieces of fresh cut mozerella right before they serve it to you piping hot
After you start eating, the cheese starts to melt and ads a lot of flavor
Yum
Great wine list with an extra expensive selection for all you big spenders
We ate here on our last night in NYC
It was perfect
We had one of the tables by the window and if you go I would recommend requesting one of these
It was an outstanding value for NYC
We had a nice bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert for under $200
The mussels and clams were fresh and my only complaint was there were only six mussels
I could've eaten a dozen
The steak I had was perfectly cooked and I've never had a flank steak this tender
It was a perfect meal and I would definately go back again
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC
Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there
Anyway, food is great, creative, fresh as always with Battali
yet my combo of dishes were too salty
the waiter couldn't fill my water glass enough
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal
I almost think you can get away with a salad pasta
by the time you get to the entrees you are struggling to finish, given the decent portion sizes of salads, pasta plus the bread brushetta to start
The food is amazing
especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like

What an amazing meal and experience! The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal! Kudos to Po!
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again
Went there last night, and I have to say I was extremely dissappointed
We had the 6 course tasting menu - the salad and first course pasta was good; the gnocchi was watery with a tasteless sauce; then came out the entree, a burnt cod
It was burnt when the waiter brought it over and I'm thinking didn't the waiter smell that it was burnt?
The service was horrible too
I had 8:30 reservations, and when I arrived there were at least 4 tables empty, but I had to wait 20 minutes! I even overheard the one waiter argue to the host about that and then they conveniently switched to speaking Spanish
Bad, bad, experience
Mario should make them change the name
I came here for my birthday and I must say Po is truly a great restaurant! While my party did have to wait a little, we were seated reasonably soon
Our server was quite knowledgeable about the wines and we had a customized 6 course tasting menu created for us! From the goat cheese and caperberry dish to hangar steak to pancottas, the food was amazing! Highly recommended
I've been going to PO since it opened almost 10 years ago and I don't understand any of the negative reviews
A couple of tips: 1
Make a reservation and arrive on time
2
Don't go on Friday or Saturday night- it's just too crowded and you will feel rushed to pay and leave
Other than that, the food is still great and it's a fantastic value
Yes, Mario Batali left, and it may not be as outstanding as it was, but it is still some of the best Italian fare in NY and the service is almost always excellent, especially if you're a regular
Being Italian I cannot say that the food was good
Although we were seated quickly, ambiance was cozy, service was decent the overall menu selection and overall food taste and presentation was less to be desired! The mussles had be be a portion of maybe 8-9 mussles only and the gnocci were basically all garlic- garlic is just meant to be a condiment- way tooo much garlic
The veal on the flip side was good
Overall not impressed
Very prompt and polite staff, perfect ambience, and not to mention that the food was exceptional! A must for all Italian gourmet lovers!
I've been to Po a few times and so far it is my favorite little italian resturant in NY
The food is fabulous, the service is great and the atmosphere is laid-back, not pretentious
The two best tables at Po for a romantic dinner for two are the two tables in the front located in the window nooks
The Linguine Vongole is fabulous, a bit oily but still really good
Other items I've had are grilled quail with reduced balsamic vinegar sauce and a wide, flat pasta with braised rabbit in a tomato sauce
Po always starts you off with excellent bread and really good olive oil
During the summer months, they have two tables for two out in front of the resturant
It's a nice place to sit if you want more of a private dinning experience
Cornelia Street is a quiet and quaint street in the West Village
This place was amazing! I had the homemade linguine with clam sauce and I cannot begin to tell you how fabulous it was! My husband had the homemade parpadalle with pork ragu
Thia place is reasonably priced as well
The service was great too
Our waitress was so helpful with the wine list
I would definately go back
The menu is not that big, but so fresh and fabulous!
Excellent service, very good value and vibrant simple flavors characterize the Po experience
No, the dishes do not surprise, but they are perhaps not meant to do so
Instead, they are well-executed classics with a delicate embelishment here and there
The wine list is good and fairly priced
Service is excellent - with the kind of intelligent, professional, articulate craft that is sorely missing in too many restaurants in NYC today
Without a reservation, our table of three was seated recently within 45 minutes (at 10:40 pm) and treated to a fine tasting - although we closed with the restaurant past midnight we were never rushed
Good show, Po!
Thought this place was going to be stuffy because of the $$$$ signs, but is not at all! Not too dimly lit, small restaurant with friendly staff
a nice place for a date
Make sure to book reservations far in advance for a good time slot, walk-ins difficult
I was 45 minutes late for my reservation and the staff did not mind at all and were still friendly, even though the place was packed
Prices were not so bad, considering we got an appetizer, two entrees, glass of wine, two desserts and a cappucino for $70 (without tip
) Definitely try it!
Went with 3 others (2 couples) and the place is sooo cozy and romantic
We all ordered the 5 course tasting menu for $40/person
The whole table must participate and you have to be willing to let the chef cook for you with no menu
We did, and were NOT dissapointed! Great food (and lots of it too!) especially for that price, though it would have been worth a lot more! Will definitely go back!
Po was such a disappointment
We were seated promptly at a nice table in the front, but dinner was downhill from there
Our waiter was rigid and unfriendly and after he took our order we did not see him again
My linguine with clams was decent but my friend's rigatoni was embarassingly undercooked
My other friend's fish was salty beyond being edible
Everyone at the table tried it and no one could force it down
The portobello appetizer was so mediocre
The dessert of ice cream with hot fudge and caramel was a joke--there was a teeny drop of sauce and that was it
We left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry! This place is very very overrated, avoid it! With so many places to go in the city, this place is not worth it
We waited for ONE HOUR to be seated, and the 6 course tasting dinner was very disappointing, but I'll let you decide (note, the chef chooses the courses)

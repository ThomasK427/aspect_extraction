The place is small, so it's great for a dinner for two, especially a romantic occasion, but not for a larger group
A friend took me to Gascogne for my birthday
We sat outdoors in the back
It was almost a shame I wasn't there with my boyfriend because it was one of the most romantic gardens I've been in
Dim candles lit the tables, the sound level was at a hush, the genteel waiter who gave us our specials on a small chalk board
I completely forgot I was still in Manhattan
The food, however, was forgettable
Good--but forgettable
We started with the scallops, a healthy serving
My friend's pheasant was a huge portion and she enjoyed it; my spinach-stuffed salmon was pleasant as well
Definitely go for the atmosphere
the yummy food is just a bonus!
This is a sensational restaurant that serves southwestern french food in a romantic, rustic and cozy setting
The cassoulet was the best I've ever had in the city
The foie gras was top notch as was every aspect of our meal
The dessert special was a real head turner presentation-wise--we opted for the poached pear w/a chocolate truffle filling coated with a lite pastry puff and drenched in sweet syrup
The couple sitting next to us took one look at our dessert and immediately confessed to dessert envy
Quiet long dining with great French food and a fun wine list
Great romantic spot
I don't understand how this restaurant got its high rating
The food was pretty basic and not interesting
I had better french food at a diner
The garden is nice during the warm days
Check out their brunch menu
Three-courses with drink and coffee starting at just $16
95
The staff was very friendly, too
The place is very small, so make reservation! In any case, it's worth the wait
Aside from the service -- which felt a little rushed -- the experience was completely first-rate
Sure, it's pricey but the food is stunningly good
I made reservations for 7 p
m
We were not seated until 7:40, thus we were told that we could not order from the pre-theater prix fixe menu
After 1
5 hours, we were told that we've been there long enough and that we had to leave
I would recommend making reservations but it doesn't seem like it really matters
We were not seated at the reserved time anyway
Fantastic, wonderful, charming, food was great, service was excellent, host was stellar, even the music was terrific
Will be back again and again and again!!
I went here for a friend's birthday party and was pleasantly surprised that this little restaurant has such a lovely backyard garden, perfect for a romantic rendevous! The Monday night prix fixe was also a pleasant surprise at $29 for four courses
The staff was cordial and attentive and with the owner personally welcoming you in and seating you, I felt like I was coming to dine at an old friend's chateau
We were a large party of 12 so we were sat downstairs in an intimate spot
Definitely will be back in the spring to check out the garden!
We were there yesterday for a pre-theater brunch, and I must say that I was very pleasantly surpised
The food was so good, and the ambience was so nice
I would recommend this place to anyone for a nice, VERY REASONABLE meal
I just discovered the Monday night prix fixe: $27 for four courses, all delicious
Discount prix fixe menus are often sloppy, and you get the sense that the restaurant is saving the good stuff for the a la carte dishes
Not so here
It was a great dinner, which I appreciated all the more for the price
Only complaint: my clafoutis dessert sort of sucked - mushy and bland
The goat cheese appetizer and tender chicken entree in a delicious honey sauce more than made up for it
As did the bill
I eat at Gascogne from time to time, and have always loved the warmth of the staff, the ambiance, the nice clientele, the food
I went last night, not having been there for about 3 months
Have things changed there, or was it just an off night? As soon as I walked in, it just didn't feel the same
There was a bartender I'd never seen before, and he wasn't as charming as their others
I didn't see the jolly owner(?) who's usually there
My entree was good, but not as good as usual
And I noticed the bill was presented in a somewhat tacky green plastic billfold
All in all, it just wasn't the experience that I'm accustomed to there
This place is a small jewl of romantic, country like restaurant that take you to another country without having to fly, right in the heart of the big apple
The service was very attentive, and personal
Specialy the owner who offered us drinks and jokes to start with
The wine list is very reasonable and contain selection of tastefull french wines to compliment the meal
If you are looking for a cozy, romantic place which offers great food and service, this is it
I've heard it's just like a REAL Parisian restaurant
Great food
Great service
Candles
Perfect
Romantic!
I went there last night with my girlfriend
We had great service from everyone -- the owner, waiter and the rest of the staff
The wine list was very reasonable (given the quality and selection) and the food was delicious
our experience was great overall
Ask to sit in the garden (when the weather permitts), in fact only try to go there in warm weather as the interior is rather plain, but the garden is beautiful
The food is excellent and filled with delicacies like truffles and foie gras
Even though the menu is a tad expensive (or more then a tad), its definitely worth it
Exquisite French fare, with a quaint country touch
I can't recall better foie gras
impeccable service, warm atmosphere, beautiful garden and, unlike Balthazaar and Pastis, quiet
If there is someone dear to you, then this consummate French experience is the way to show it
Last time we were at Gascogne couple years ago and seems to me it was much cheaper place money and food wise
This time we came there because so many other places were closed on the Christmas night
We were able to make reservations with almost no notice
half hour in advance
The place was full
We got very romantic table downstairs
The food was supperb, much better than I remember
Well worth the money we spent
The French? Nah
just kidding
Though we didn't dine in the romantic garden, we had the next best seats: overlooking the windowpanes onto the garden
The owner/waiter greeted accomodated us warmly and like family
A lovely and tasty dinner well worth the price
I hesitate to write much about Gascogne, because then it will become even more crowded than it already is! Such delicious food
The $29 weeknight prix fixe is one of the best bargains in town
and the totally French ambiance!!! Ooh-la-la! The romantic garden is the pice de rsistance, however
To be able to dine with a loved one in this charming setting and such delicious food, is pure delight

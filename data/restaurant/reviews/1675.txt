Instead she made horrible faces and wild gestures in my direction
What a moron
The food is mediocre, overpriced and I don't know how they get away with classifying themseleves as Brazillian
And it's supposed to be open 23 hours a day, but my friends and I were ushered out at 2 AM
What the
? Bottom line: it sucks and is SO overrated
coffeeshop is the ultimate place to grab a bite after a hard night of partying
the service is excellent, and the food is SO GOOD
try the cheese fries, or the salads
and if you want food, but you're not ready to stop drinking, well, by all means, continue here!
Have been going for years b/c I work in the area, and have found that the food is always good, often better than good, comes out quickly, service is always excellent
I eat here all the time so I know, I don't understand the negative ratings
The staff thinks they are working on a runway, and the attitude is ridiculous
Too crowded, overly trendy and nasty staff
You actually need a reservation for a booth! Menu selections are trying too hard, and the food is fair at best and overly priced, with hamburgers in the teens
Plenty of good restaurants in the area, to waste the time and money on this one again
Our painful experience began when my friend's smoothie arrived, OVERFLOWING onto the table, and the waiter didn't make an effort to clean it up
Next, my eggs and toast arrived
lukewarm and without the toast
so the waiter took my plate away and returned it again, without the toast, which arrived on its own plate (the eggs were cold by now)
I was really hungry, which the bus-boy must have realized since he grabbed my plate as i was mid-bite (read: our hands were on the plate at the same time)
Before we could order coffee, the waiter handed us the check
minus a smile
At least the entertainment was free, as we were able to witness one customer wooing a waitress, and another being drenched in milk
two eggs $8, cheese omelette $9, smoothie $5, tax and tip $6, lunch at the coffe shop
priceless
mediocre food, mediocre service, loud, attitude but with a good bar scene
good location
the only thing that saves this restaurant is the location
obviously that is what is paying the rent
plus the trendy people that want to be seen in there
too much drama
I can't say anything for the food
Went there on a Friday night
The restaurant is diner-esque but homey with a relaxed atmosphere
Downstairs (something a lot of people don't know about) is a cool lounge that is packed
Downstairs is nicer but less for people watching, upstairs is busting and a little busier
The general crowd is decent looking
Waitresses are hot for the men
The Men are a little lacking for the women
Drinks are decent for about $8
Try the caprinias mojitos
A nice place to go when you don't want to rowdiness of a bar and don't want to go all out for a club
is the worst restaurant in nyc
they have the worst service, and because they think their staff is pretty, they believe they can do whatever they want
The Coffee Shop is a great place to end up after a serious night of drinking
It has a great atmosphere and it's never taken more than 10 minutes for me to get my food
Overall food is OK
The service is consistently horrible
We had a group of five once, the place was empty and they refused to let us sit at a booth designated for four, or a banquet which sat 6
The nasty host insisted that I wait 45 minutes in an empty restaurant for the one table designated for 5
I wasn't seated until I made a big stink with the restaurant manager
By the way where is the sexy waitstaff?? The men are women and the women are men???
it's all about location, hot staff (men, too, but mainly women), affordability and energy at this place
go there during the busy hours if you want to get pissed off
chances are, you'll have to wait forever and the hostess will be nasty
the food is decent, not terrible, but certainly not great
chicken sandwich and turkey burger are good
fries w/and w/o chili on top are obviously of the frozen variety (read: don't order them)
What the hell is the attraction? The food and service is the worst in recent memory
The staff are not that beautiful to constitute their abuse and lack of training
Must definitley be on the health dept's hit list, because the place is filthy
DONT GO
THIS SCENE IS FINISHED
In the competitive business of New York City restaurants where 50% fail in the first year, it's a wonder NO! a miracle how a place like COFFEE SHOP can exist
Rude service coupled with substandard food is a recipe for disaster in this city of I can eat out everyday for a year and not visit every restaurant
Well maybe people are a glutton for punishment? The staff is like the Wicked Witch of the North,South, East and West! I felt like Dorthy in her Ruby Shoes I JUST WANTED TO GO HOME
Ive never encounterd the velvet rope policy here
Only thing was when it was really crowded, you had to order a meal to sit outside, which is fine with me
It is open 23 hours, a huge plus, and is in a great location right across from union square park, Virgin megastore, and nyu dorms, so there is alot of activity going on
The food has ranged from being pretty bad to very good in the times that I went there
I guess its just what you order and the day you order it on
The service is preety slow and the staff can get a bit rude but some of them sure are hot!
I like the scene here but the attitudes of the host seating people for food is just terrible
There were about 15 empty tables towards the back and he was adament about keeping me in the first table
I just walked out
It's the halfway house for models and actresses and they're mad at us that they have to work
I had gone here a few times last year and the place was fun, there was a guy(sort of)who was great -since then its just hot dumb people:( the food was always not great not terrible and yes the place had a sense of humor that unfornuately its lost
Do you have a ZERO rating? They have the worst waiters/waitress I have ever encountered! I went with a few friends last week
It was 4am so we decided to share a few sandwiches
The waitress had the balls to tell us that we needed to order 4 individual meals since we were taking up a table outside that could have generated her more tips
What a way to talk to customers! I was shocked and outraged
I though I apologized for not each ordering a separate plate (Im a well mannered person), we still didnt get service for the rest of the night
We had to find our own utensils while the waitresses strutted around
The food was unmemorable, not worth the 12 bucks we paid for a lukewarm sandwich
Never again
New Yorkers get a bad rap because of these people
I have given this restaurant four chances to prove itself to me
Each time was worse than the time before
The last time we were here we actually sat at the table for 45 minutes without any service
We asked several of the waitstaff to help us out and they all refused
What a ridiculous way to run a restaurant
It's really the service here that stinks
Don't go if you are looking to have a good time out
Ranch 1 claims to make the best chicken sandwich on earth
The sandwich is mediocre
Not bad, but far from the best on earth
The counter service is fast and there's plenty of seating
But the place could use sprucing up

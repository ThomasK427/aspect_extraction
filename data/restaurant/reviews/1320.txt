Service was very fast and attentive
There was no wait to be seated
What else could you wish for? It is a little expensive for Williamsburg but it is fully worth it
My Moon is the best looking joint in Willy-B
The food is perfectly fine Turkish food, which automatically makes it better than most restaurants in town
The mixed mezze platters are decently priced, given the surroundings
The service isn't always speedy, but it's always been friendly to me
The crowd isn't local, but, do you need to dine among small-town coke-heads every night? In fact, My Moon's greatest power may be that to transport diners - out of Williamsburg, out of NYC, to some particularly chic corner of the Sultanahmet district
There's even a view of a Byzantine-style church
If only they could get them to take the cross off of the spire
the food was cold, expensive and horrible, its a shame because the space is really nice
do not go
It is a great LOOKING place, but this restaurant could be so much better! The food is average at best it is expensive for what it is
basically the same food as the local kebab place but not as good 3x the price
We sampled quite a few things
The tarama was good, but the grilled shrimp was so blah! It was like $17
it had 5 medium sized shrimp that were obviously cooked from frozen, not fresh
You could tell - they had no flavor had that rubbery textire
They were completely cooked but boring
This place was a big dissapointment w/ a little work on the menu, the chef, the ingredients this restaurant could be so much better!
Outdoor dining entising but look at the menu
boring Turkish? The final course had a hint of Turkish
Ice cold fried potato came with the ok Swordfish Kebabs
The Calamari/Tartare Sauce was boring
Wine was $8 glass
Pricey for Williamsburg quality more like $5
All 4 of us didn't enjoy our meal
The bread was tasteless
They refilled our water classes every 5 mins
comical
Cocktail waitress humorless
Waiter was experienced and enthusiastic almost apologetic
Expensive by Williamsburg standards $17 entrees
The crowd mostly bridge tunnel
Hopefully not a sampling of the New Williamsburg Invasion
Management and owners seem nice but this project is very ambitious to a fault and unimaginate in menu to match
Damage control should step in quickly because the outdoor set up is great
Recommendation - take that big braiser off the dining room wall and start making some good inspired food
My partner and I tried My Moon for the first time last week and were so impressed we went back at the weekend
I cannot understand why so many reviews criticised the food, which I thought was excellent; well above average and containing many of the authentic flavours of Turkish cuisine with a modern spin
The cold appetisers were delicious, especially the stuffed vine leaves, the zucchini pancakes and the wonderfully creamy tarama
The baklava was delightfully syrupy and sweet
Our wait person was friendly and attentive
Were we just lucky or has the place dealt with its teething troubles?
the decor was much better than the food
the drinks weren't anything to rave about
the food was slightly above average, as were the prices
but the decor and space are great, both inside and out
would be good for a big party
Meet your date here for drinks before a show or event, or bring your parents here for a drink when they come to the neighborhood, everyone will be impressed and the outdoor tented tables are very romantic
But until the staff is actually trained in how to BE a staff, and the food takes a turn for the above-mediocre, it's difficult to see how they can charge what they do and expect customers to feel blessed to be in the space
The jazz trio also ruined our night
Tell me, WHO wants to shout over three long haired hippies having an improv jam session? Otherwise it just feels like a fashion show with one named euros talking about their art -- and it just made me want to go home and shower
I have had a lot of Turkish food in my time
When this place opened my brother and I checked it out ASAP and we decided that it is worthwhile food
We have been back a couple of times since
The service isn't that great, Williamsburg is notorious for bad service
The beautiful ambiance (reminds me of Istanbul) and the food make up for that
These reviews say it isn't enough food
My brother and I have never left hungry
Perhaps you have not been ordering the right way and most likely used to eating at TGIF where the portions could feed a starving nation
When eating Turkish food you must order many meze's, there are so many tasty things to eat, the small turkish pizza, the borek, the dolma, the zucchini pancakes these are excellent
For entree I would recommend Doner, and chicken shish is excellent
Great decor, no question, The outside seating and the interior of the restaurant make this a great spot to hang out on summer nights
The food and the service, however, leave a lot to be desired
Service was slow, order was mixed up and the food, once it got there was average at best
It's too bad because if they get a better chef and more competent wait staff this will be a top shelf spot
The place was beatiful but I wouldn't recommend eating there the price is way overpriced and such small portions of food, plus what ever was on the menu
they didn't have it the way it was on there would reccomend for drinks only if youre thinking of eating do not go hungry
they definetly need a new chef
It potentially seemed to be a great place and the dcor was awesome
The furniture is made out of old water tanks, a metaphor for the post-industrial ambiance of the ever-changing neighborhood
It stops there
We felt that we were forced out of our water tank booth
Our food order was mixed up; the service was horrible and unfriendly
The patrons are totally 50-dollar die jobs, mass marketed ironic Ts, on mid-west physiques
The music is like Miami techno (trying too hard)
The people that work there are too ugly to be rude
The bartender there is a big skank too
Great ambience and friendly staff but utterly incompetent
The appetizers were so-so and the main course
well, I didn't get my main course (Sea Bass)
I waited for 45 minutes for my entree to realize that the waiter never put the order in
Due to time constraints, I was forced to finish my girlfriend's entree
I would not recomment this place - they need to get their act together
Having read the previous reviews, I think that everyone should give My Moon a chance
Though I definetly agree the portions are not that great, so don't come hungry, but do try the food it's not that bad! The atmosphere and the outside seating really makes up for the cons at this place, but with time it will pick up to be what it is destined to be, considering the location
The owners are very friendly and if you ever want to rent the space, I would definetly recommend it, they are willing to work with you and your needs
I can't agree more with the cshakes review
We had the same exact experience with the shish kebab
Tough meat when we asked for medium, 4 peices of meat and the words uncle ben's minute rice also came out of our mouth
The prices aren't bad if they served larger portions
Go have a drink there the space is beautiful and buy an appetizer maybe, but pass on dinner, not well cooked and small portions
Staff is ok, will get better
The person at the door was very friendly
Hope reviews like this will turn the place around, since it has wonderful potential
I went to Mymoon last night for dinner with high expectations
The space is cavernous and beautifully designed and the manager/greeter was very friendly
After being seated, and waiting maybe 10 minutes, my companion and I were finally approached by a waitress for whom the word Incompetent would be a compliment
We order a number of small plates, all of which arrived cold, and with insulting portions (3 Small Grilled Shrimp, One Small Octopus Leg)

It's a beautiful restaurant in a great neighborhood
I read prior criticism of the service and I'm surprised, it's never been a problem for us
2 thumbs up for Palmira's, I love it
We were drawn in by the $18 prix fixe from 5pm to 7pm, three courses, and half off wine
The food was solid, though the service was slow at times
To compensate, they comped us three glasses of wine without us even raising a finger or mentioning the service
Classy joint, good food, and I'm glad to have it in the neighborhood
I've now been to Palmira's three times and the experiences have been consistently outstanding
Last night the wife and I went for the daily 5pm-7pm $18 prix-fixe, which included choices of appetizer (my stuffed mushrooms were delicious), entree (rigatoni for me, chicken for her), and dessert (tiramisu and zeppoles)
Everything was delicious, including the bruschetta
Also, the 5-7 special includes wine at half-price, and the service was excellent (no, I do not work at or have any financial interests in Palmira's)  In all, we went in hungry and left stuffed for only $55 (including drinks, tip, tax)
This place is an EXCELLENT VALUE FOR HIGH-QUALITY FOOD AND DRINKS
My only concern is that the crowds always seem light, suggesting Palmira's may not be around a year from now
One last thing: don't let the street construction fool you - the ambience inside is pretty good
I am in the process of viewing every Soul Food Restaurant and this one is a Uptown Special when I need to impress my family again
The ambience was inviting but the service was slow
If you go to the Apollo please have dinner after at Mobay's uptown
I ordered food from home at the Brooklyn Mobay's I wasn't to please with it except the Catfish
I have been to Mobay's several times and I have not been dissatisfied yet
The ambience is so inviting
Enjoying the company of live music is always a treat and the staff is superb
Sometimes the waiting area can become a little overcrowded but, it is well worth the wait
I love you Mobay's!
The food is great, hats off to the chef
Although the drinks are a little pricey, they are well worth it
I recommend reservations, especially at night time and especially on the weekends because it gets really busy
The live music is great! To be such a small restaurant and for it to be so busy I think the the staff does an outstanding job
Stopped in tuesday night the food was FANTASTIC the live band was AWESOME and Sasha our waitress was GREAT!!!! on a scale from one to ten Mo Bay Uptown gets an eleven!!!!
I have been to MoBays atleast 10 times in teh past six months and each time I have enjoyed it more and more
I was utterly surprised when I read some of the other reviews which mentioned negative things about the staff
The manager has always been welcoming and friendly and the waitstaff is a cut above the rest
I was impressed from the visit and my expectations continue to be surpassed with each visit
This has become the monthly meeting place for me and my girlfrends
And the bartender serves one of the best martinis i have ever tasted
Please visit MoBay and formulate your own opinion I guarantee you won't regret it
Thanks to teh owner and staff for bringing class back to Harlem
Rude manager and wait staff
Not a good place for large groups
Had a reservation for 10
4 of us arrived at 6:45 for a 7:00 reservation
We were threatened and told that if the entire party was not there by 7:20 we would be asked to leave
The reservations were made a month in advance and confirmed at least on 4 separate occassions including the afternoon of the dinner before arrival
The staff is not professional and does not know how to cater to large parties
The food was just ok and was the dinner prices are outrageous
Additionally, there is a huge mark-up on bar drinks
Service was slow and the food arrived cold after the long wait
I ordered an entire cake for the birthday celebration from MoBay and was charged $65 for the cake alone
My advice is to leave MoBay's alone
Horrible, horrible experience
I had the misfortune of being a guest at Mobay on 1/28/06
We were coldly greeted by a hostess and wait staff who, in spite of our reservation, did not want to seat any of us, including the elderly, until our entire party had arrived
After convincing them to seat us, we were warned that if our entire party of nine did not arrive by 7:20PM, we would lose our reservation
AND THIS WAS THE HIGHLIGHT of the evening
The food was mediocre, at best
The red snapper was so small it should have been thrown back
The jerk shrimp had no kick
A birthday cake had been ordered 2 weeks in advance
We were charged by the slice for the entire cake ($60)
The drink specials were basically soda and flavored vodka, at $10-12 each
The foor was excellent and I would recommend this place to others
I would suggest that you check your bank statement if using a debit card
The cashier at the front charged me twice for one lunch special and getting my account credited was a big ordeal
They always have live music and the musicians are well chosen and excellent! I love the food too
They have a smoker on site so the ribs are EXCELLENT! The two-sided bar is a wonderful place to sit and they have a very good drink selection
I can't say enough good things about Mobay
It was JUST what Harlem needed
Thanks!
A friend and I were strolling to the subway last night after an Apollo Theater Fundraiser on 125th Street and this lively little place brightened up the block and aroused our curiosity
We went in and were greeted warmly, we sat at a unique two sided bar, expecting to listen to live jazz and have a drink
After a moment I had the catfish strips, fabulous, then my friend tried the baby back ribs, outstanding
We journeyed on to the crabcakes, best I've ever tasted
Two friends joined us at the bar and had the combination appetizer platter
We all proclaimed that the bar food at MoBay is as good as it get's in the city
I am going back for dinner soon, to enjoy good eats and great live music, what a find

I called to make reservations for 10-13
When we arrived at the restaurant that Sat, every employee acted as if they had never heard of us
The rude manager practically called me a liar and told me that no one would ever allow me to make reservations for over 10 ppl
I told her of my conversation with the hostess and that I even confirmed that I was bringing my own cake
I asked what I should do because my whole party (incl out of towners, pregnant women, etc) had arrived
She shrugged her shoulders and told me she could seat us at random tables after seating other parties who actually did have reservations, otherwise, wait 2 hrs to sit together
I then called the nearby Den
They were not quite open for the evening, but told me that they would open early to accommodate us
Now thats service!
Mobays embodies what a restaurant should be about
The food is excellent, always fresh, always consistent and presented beautifully
I have not had one dish there that I have not enjoyed
The ambience is rich and relaxing ready decorated and befitting any occasion with appropriate live entertainment
Mobys possess an intimate, yet open and friendly environment
I have met and enjoy many wonderful people
I look forward to More Mobay!!
The food and service was average, but the gospel brunch was nonexistent because there was no separate brunch menu and the music promised, a live band, never showed up
Unlike most brunch places, the coffee and drinks are billed separate
When I got the bill and saw I was billed separately for each cup of coffee, I asked the waiter if he could do anything since the menu doesn't even list drinks and the manager said no

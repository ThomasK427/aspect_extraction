perfect place to celebrate, or for dates
l would say the best experience l have had
service is phenomenal, the server knew everything about the food, very helpful and courteous
we ordered the$100 tasting course which was the best
the texture in each dish was unique, delicious
the steak with the garlic sauce, or blanc mange with a lobster, not to mention the fresh sushi that comes with miso soup, the best l have had, and the dessert?!we had bon sai, cream cheese, which is in a shape of frog, moonlight, homemade desserts, suprisingly flavorful, sumptuous
very creative, beutiful presentation and also comes with a home made sorbet, very warm atmoshphere, welcome
we had a beautiful time, memoriable
we eat at ninja and l could say that was one of the best experience l've had
delicious food along with ninja coctails, we really enjoyed it
we had our private room, table
very friendly atmosphere, excellente service
we had a tasting course but l cant really tell which one l really liked, all of them had a unique taste
very fresh sushi and they give you a fresh wasabi that the server grate it in front of you
delicious soup, meteorite soup which is cooked in front of your eyes, you gotta see it to believe it
not only the dishes will entertain you, but also the place itself along with the stuff
we really had a good time, highly recommended
This famous Tokyo restaurant finally opened its door
Fixed couse starts from $80, $100 and up
I tried $100 menu and it was a great mix of fine Japanese food (not only sushi
) This is not the traditional restaurant
Let's say, fine dining and entertainement combined
Since all the rooms are private, it is good for small birthday party, etc
Ninja will give you the mysterious and unique fine dining experience!! Highly recommended!
Absoulutely dissapointing
I knew I would be spending a ton of money because of the places reputation in Tokyo and the setup (which is pretty cool sinc eit looks like ninja cave) but the food was below mediocre I have been to many (I mean many) sushi and Japanese restaurants in NY and around teh world for that matter---- the food is not tasty the combinations are terrible --- the waiter was very amateur definately seemed like it was his first week as a waiter ever---- we spent about 165 dollars a person (we had two bottles of sake) unbelieveable that they put all that work into designing the place and none into teh quality of the food----every ordinary village sushi place on every corner outdoes this place by a landslide----- go in for 10 minutes look around say ah this is cool lookin place then leave---tiny rooms also
l've heard about ninja, l couldn't wait to see it to believe it
servers are dressed like ninja's, act like ninja's
atmosphere is great, excellent service, very friendley
the food is very delicious, tasting portinos, we went out in a group we ordered frome the course menu
it was just something, the food it self is very delicate, tasty, fresh, and entertaining dishes?! they have a small but very good selection of wine/sake
we really had a good time with some little magic too, on the top of it
l cannot wait to go back
thanks Rin
loved the food, drinks atmosphere
good $$ but long wait (busy spot)
vegetarian friendly too! need to go bk soon :)
You cannot beat this place for authenticity and atmosphere
It's actually so cool that I don't even want to review it as it's already hard enough to get a table
In short, go, and try everything on the menu--not for the faint
Hearts, skins, and livers are delicious
Have a riceball with salmon if you need heavy food, but otherwise have a handful of skewers
The tuna sashimi is probably the best in NYC--perfectly cubed morsels of goodness
They don't have chicken sashimi anymore and that was the best thing around for pure shock factor
Don't look for sushi on the menu although there's tons of sake and it's served properly
Your cup runnath over
I just realized today how much BAD service in a restaurant can completely reverse your experience
Even if the meal is as you would expect, bad service will make you reconsider going to the same place again
Whats annoying is the most that I actually used to like this restaurant
I enjoy the food itself
I used to spend around $60 for two($120-$150 for more than 3-4 people)
However, they will keep making you uncomfortable until you order certain price range that they desire and they will kick you out right away if they think you are not going to order any more
What a fantastic business mind!
this is one of my favourite restaurants in the city
theres a great deal of selection on the menu, semi-helpfully separated into different sections (tasty, healthy, limited, rice noodles, chefs recommendation)
its hard to decide what to get, so try something from each section (dishes range from $7-$12, yakitori from $2
50-$3
50)
the bittermelon with tofu egg is really good, though those with milder tastes should try something else (perhaps the non-offensive mild fried fish cakes)
for more filling dishes, the zousui (congee with chicken) is tasty and satisfying
among the yakitori, the succulent marbled pork skewers (either with mustard lemon juice or scallions yuzu sauce) are exceptional
chicken meatball skewers (there are a few varieties) are flavourful and juicy as well
including tax tip, our bill usually ranges from $55-$75 for 2 ppl
try a bunch of different things! ive never been disappointed
Yakitori is simple street fare in Japan
And in NYC this genre runs the spectrum from simple pub food fare to gourmet
In this case, Yakitori Totto is the gourmet extreme
Very well done food, original offerings
If you don't mind paying well to eat good food, then definetly give this place a try
If you don't want to pay that much, then head south to St
Mark's steet
So happy to find this spot
The service is warm, the atmosphere fun and the food AMAZING
I love the Shochu Grapefruit cocktail
It comes to your table with a half grapfuit and juicer - fresh and with a great little kick! The chicken meatball Yakitori and quail egg is wonderful
The okra and yam salad is delicious but only for those who are interested in something very different
We spent about 2 hrs just cranking through the menu amazed by the unique delicate flavors
Ryohei was the most welcoming host (hope you love the Stereolob CD!)
This place is a true gem that offers quality unique food at a very good value
We are regulars--can't really get enough of Yakitori Totto
By far one of the best Japanese restaurants in NYC, serving perfect chicken skewers to drink with beer
The organic chicken is so good that unusual parts are delicious and shouldn't be missed (gizzard, liver, soft knee bone, tail) and even sashimi is wonderful
(We have brought many people here and anyone who tries the chicken sashimi loves it
) Skewered pork, prawns, vegetables and duck (when available) are also perfect
Dishes to complement the skewers that we love include kyona salad (with tiny fried fish and soft-cooked egg) and the best chicken soup you will find anywhere
Desserts are great too!
I'm from Tokyo and I'm not the biggest fan of the places on St
Marks, so when I found Totto I was so ecstatic
It's clean and not smokey at all plus the food is really authentic, with just enough originality
Totally reminds me of the small restaurants in Tokyo
But like everyone says, it gets crowded so come early
Although a little bit more pricey than the bland joints on St
Mark's, but the food here is definitely worth the extra few dollars
The yakitori (skewers) here is excellent and their sake collection is decent as well
This place was probably the most authentic Japanese restaraunt that I have been to in NY
I enjoyed every single bit of it, the food, the service, the crowd and the ambiance
I feel like I were in Tokyo
What to experience a bit of Lost in Translation buzz, come to this restaurant
I think it serves the best yakitori in town
A chain restaurant of the original in Tokyo

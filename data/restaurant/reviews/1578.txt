The food was good, the service was fine, and the place has a lot of visual atmosphere, but I would not go back unless I was stuck eating with someone I didn't want to listen to
Whenever I want to have a special night in Manhattan with friends or family, I always take them to Candela
The food and atmosphere are spectacular
Be sure to get there for the pre-theater price fix menu to get an appetizer, main course, and dessert for $19
99! You have a limited selection but the food is incredible for only $20
If you're looking for a romantic restaurant with fabulous food, Candela is the place to go!
I loved this place! After reading the reviews on Citysearch
com my boyfriend and I deceided to try Candela out
We started with the crab cake appetizer which was superb
I had the salmon on soba noodles and he had the hanger steak and spare ribs
Both were excellent
The service was great as well
I highly recommend Candela
My opinion and experience
Candela is an Oasis indeed
The perfect getaway for romance
You can feel the warmth and the sexyness of the place as soon as you walk in
The food and the service was perfect
We had the Pre-Theatre Dinner which was affordable and delicious
Definately a place to return
I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary back in September
Got the idea for coming here off of Citysearch's Most Romantic Restaurant list
While Candela looks nice, it is not overwhelmingly romantic
I do agree with some reviewers saying that it can look Midevil and that it's too dark to be really romantic, however my girlfriend did enjoy the atmosphere quite a bit
The food is solid yet unspectacular
Fortunately, it doesn't break the bank either
The service was attentive without being overbearing
We would definitely recommend going there to someone but it's not a place I would choice to pop the question
Also a good choice for first dates, which was how I first heard of it
This restaurant is like none other you have seen before, the interior really looks like a medieval eating quarter
wrought iron chandeliars lit by (real) candles, torches against the stone walls, the place really looked majestic
However, the food fell far short of expectations
First, it was very very crowded, and second, the quantity you expect for $$$ is very low in comparison
Nonetheless, a nice place to eat out if you're in the mood for some gothic dining
I've been here twice: 1
small company holiday party, and 2
with friends
The food is great, the warm melted center-chocolate cake is fabulous
The Dumplings are a great appetizer
The bar area is trendy and fun with a see and be seen atmosphere
The candels/chandeliers, luxurious drapes all provide a lovely medieval atmosphere
However, the extremely slow and nonchalant service distracted from what could have been a fantastic dining experience
On our second trip, our waiter had an attitude, was slow to bring/refill drinks, and we had to flag him down for EVERYTHING
We left a minimal tip to communicate our disappointment
Upon seeing it, our waiter sarcastically thanked us for the great tip
as if he didn't understand why we weren't happy with the service! I hope that waiter no longer works at Candela so that diners can enjoy a potentially fantastic restaurant
candela is the most romantic restaurant in the great borough of manhattan
with all the candles how can one expect anything less
my girlfriend and I dined there the other night
relaxed and elegant
a joy
A great assortment of food
The only lighting is from candles -- which is romantic -- but it can be hard to simply read the menu!
Went to Candela for brunch this past Sunday
While the food was good and reasonably priced, the service was horrible
Our waiter never once came by the table to ask us how our meal was
Consequently, we couldn't order additional juice/drinks or get ketchup and condiments
Lastly, he didn't bring us enough change when we were finally able to track him down to get our check
Management needs to do a better job of training their staff and hiring competent and caring servers
We have been to Candela several times
Consistently great atmoshphere for drinks and snacks at the bar
Just as enjoyeable on a warm night as it is on a cold one!
very nice place
Quiet atmosphere nice music
Pricey cocktails! 10 for a margarita
Anyhoo, I had the chicken dumplings for an apetizer, hanger steak as an entree and warm chocolate cake as dessert
All were delicious
My date said the same about her food
Could use more vegetarian friendly items on the menu and the staff was a little hit and miss with attention
seriously, dont read any rating where the person rated this restaurant any less then 10 - they clearly have no idea what happens when great food equals great value
in living here for nearly 6 years and eating out every weekend - i frequent candelas and recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic yet fun place to eat
i highly recommend the organic chicken but replace the mashed potatoes with sweet potatos from the pork dish, you will forever thank me
(dont get me wrong the reg mashed are good too - as everything from the menu - but the sweet potatoes are to die for
) great for dinner with friends, dinner before attending de la guarda or a romantic evening - fits every need
also you dont mind waiting because theres such a buzz around the bar it makes you feel like you are out for drinks
The setting at Candela is very romantic
Great place for a date and the food is great
I will definitely be back
candlelight is the most flattering lighting!
Candle light and techno music makes for a pefect combination
This Mid-evil decorated hip NYC spot is a definite must if you want to impress your date
Tempt her with the fresh raw oysters, and one of their great chocolate deserts, and you guranteed to have a lucky night
I heard such great things about this place but found there wasn't really anything spectacular about the menu
The food was good, not great and the staff kept forgetting about us
When they did attend to us, they removed my dinner plate while I was still eating and brought us the wrong drinks
As far as ambience goes, it was very romantic and sexy
I'm sure it's a great date place
i must say that i was shocked to see candela restauant at only a 7 on the most romantic list
candela by far blows away most of its competitors listed above
i find the food consistantly amazing and the room itself to be not only cozy and inviting but friendly as well as romantic
i have had the pleasure of dining at candela several times and everyone that i have recommended this awesome restaurant to has agreed - it's the perfect place for an intimate evening with friends or a lover
There wasn't really anything spectacular about the menu, but I would have to agree with a lot of people here and say that Candela is one of the most romantic spots in the restaurant
Took a first date here and we had a great time
The wine list is very good, and the desserts make up for any originality lacking on the menu
Check it out
Great place to be with that special person
Could it be the decor or just the area where the restaurant is at
The menu is great and it is nice to feel relaxed in a pplace where there are beautiful people
This restaurant is one of my favorites in the city--it has a reasonable wine list, excellent food, nice atmosphere (including the dinner music); it also won't hit you too hard in the wallet, considering it's manhattan
I took my boyfriend to the city as a surprise for his 30th birthday

there were also 2 tall guys, one had great curly hair with the biggest smile,,,,, and the other had the most mysterious face
hmmm how can you resist that??? go girls!!
BLT seems to be getting overextended in a hurry and it shows
We really enjoyed BLT steak when it first opened
BLT Fish downstairs is nothing special though always crowded
BLT Prime seemed past its primae already thouhg BLYT himself was there when we dined
Should spend more time overseeing kitchen than schmoozing the ladies
look at the bad reviews Brasserie Ruhlmann has gotten even after he's taken over there as well
The steak at Steak is good but the intense heat used creates and almost uniform char that seems unnatural
Lots of sides on the menu but none are memorably great
Even the gruyere popovers that wowed us at Steak were served cold at Prime
Looks good, has nice stats, but a bit overrated
The prime rib was good, definetely not in Lugar or Mark Joseph's class
The creamed spinach was outstanding but the portion was TINY as was the au gratin potatoes
The deserts are definetely better than your typical NY chop house
The Crepes with Passion Fruit - outstanding
The lemon merengue was bit mundane
Overall, a good dining experience but only go on the expense account - or if The Boss is paying
The food was excellent, if perhaps a bit too rich, as was the presentation and service
The atmosphere is loud and airy, punctuated by 80s pop songs
I enjoyed a fantastic selection by the sommelier
My one complaint: smoked salt on my kobe steak almost drowned out the flavor of the meat, which by itself was heavenly
The tuna tartare appetizer and maple cheese cake dessert were both divine
Would return here in a heartbeat!
I love this place
I eat here about twice a week, simply for pleasure
The service is always great and the food is remarkable
I hope interested guests won't believe the personal slander that is obviously listed in the below review
Vive la BLT PRIME!!!
After hearing about it from my friends, I had to check this place out
Overall, I thought it was great - the food was delicious and the waitstaff was unbelievable - however i could of done without the snotty hosts
Had our company party at this overpriced attitude meca
They turned away guests at the door telling them there was no party there that night, understaffed our party so guests weren't served drinks or appetizers, food was completely mediocre for $125 pp
With it's supposed reputation I expected excellence
We got appetizers and service I would expect at a Diner
Afterwards they could have cared less about listening to our complaints or trying to keep a client
I work in television and there were many high profile guests that I guarantee will never go back to BLT Prime
You would think in New York where restaurants have to struggle to stay on top, they would do anything to make a bad situation right
But their prices must be so inflated, one $7000 party doesn't matter
Don't beleive the hype
Give your money to a restaurant that deserves your patronage and support!!!
This place was a huge disappointment
The steak was not tender and had a lot of tendons in it making it hard to cut since all the pieces were jus stringing together
I was sawing my way through dinner and eventually just gave up
My french fries arrived cold and when I requested some ketchup, 20 min later the waiter finally came back to tell me that the kitchen had ran out?!? How can a supposedly upscale restaurant run out of ketchup? I mean Mcdonalds has the stuff by the boatloads! Good thing I filled up on their popovers and appetizers because they were the only good things there
BTW, this place loves to blast 80s music so if 80s isnt ur era and want to be able to talk to the person across from you then forget this place
I've had better steak at Capital Grill
The space is beautiful, the waitstaff was extremely helpful and the food was amazing
What more could you ask for?
I've eaten at Prime too many times to count
Each time, the experience has been memorable
I've read reviews on this site claiming that the Kobe beef is unimpressive and that they had to wait a long time for a table
Hello? This is New York
All of the dry-aged steaks--the Porterhouse, the New York Strip, the Double Cut Sirloin, and the Rib Eye--are all tender and delicious
Love the Hen of the Woods and Potato Skins
Food aside--and people should know that Prime's Chef de Cuisine is Marc Forgione, son of New York Food Guru Larry Forgione (remember 'An American Place'?) is always in the kitchen--Prime has one of the best wine lists in New York
Great wine, great food, great jovial staff
What's not to like?
for starters, the hostess that night was a pompous snob
we stood there and waited while finished her little convo with a waitress before she would even acknowledge us, then spoke with such an air of arrogance that sounded as if we were annoying her
for appetizer, i ordered the tuna tartare, which tasted like a tuna roll i could have order at any little japanese place
my dinner date ordered the bacon, nothing more than rubbery salt
for entree, i had the braised short ribs, was ok
He had the american kobe steak, it came out cold and WAY OVER DONE
theres nothing kobe about the taste or texture
for sides, the aspargus was cold and burnt, the stuffed mushrooms were cold too and the stuffing tasted like crumbled Ritz Crackers with butter
For dessert just coffee, which turned out to be the best tasting item on the menu
Ok, I could not wait to try this place
To start off with, the wine list prices were bordering on obscene ($380 for 97 beringer private reserve for example)
I ended up having a Pauillac by the glass
It wasnt bad
The appetizers: crab cake and an order of bacon
The crab cake was barely average, the bacon was tasty, but too salty to eat more than a couple of bites
For the main course we split a Kobe hanger steak and the risotto with white truffles special ( $78)
The steak was good
The truffles must have been sliced last week because there was not even a hint of truffle aroma!
Went with another couple, and got seated in a luxurious upstairs booth
Ordered the porterhouse for two but realized what happens when you broil meat with 1200 degrees -- it gets BURNED, not pleasantly charred, on the outside
The other couple ordered the filet and the tuna, which they said were excellent
All our sides -- creamed spinach, potato with creamy mustard sauce, duck fat potatoes -- were delicious
Service was pleasant
At the end of dinner, however, we left rather quickly
The loud, large tables of men on their 7th jack and coke remind you that this is basically a dressed-up steakhouse
I'd go back in a second if it were at a quieter time and someone else were paying -- and I wouldn't order the porterhouse again
We went to BLT for thanksgiving weekend and ordered 2 kobe rib eye - medium rare, mine without black pepper
At $72 they were a disaster
My friend's rib eye was terribly overcooked
He complained to the waiter and 20 minutes later, the manager - Mindy - comes over and asked what the problem was
My friend indicated that he had asked for the rib eye medium rare and
she interrupted him
Without even looking at the dry piece of meat on his plate she started in a most patronizing manner a rehearsed speech on the def
of medium rare
We told her to look at the piece of meat
She looked at it - for the first time- and said we should have told her sooner!!!! ohh, later I found that my rib eye HAD black pepper
I have been to BLT Steak so many times and was expecting a similar experience, but BLT Prime was even better! The waitstaff was amazing
The was some confusion over our reservation time, but they sat us promptly on a Sat
night even though according to thier schedule we were almost an hour late
The food was as good as always
Love the new downtown location!! Will become a regular!
I'd been looking forward to this night and it was a huge disappointment

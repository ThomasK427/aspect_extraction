We had heard that the space was fantastic and the food was great, but that the service was not so hot
To our surprise the waitstaff was super attentive, the manager stopped by our table to introduce themselves and check on us and everything went smoothly
All in all, it was a treat to find such a cool space on the upper west side and we definitely intend to go back
Have been there twice and have been equally as ignored by the bartender, this all the while, the manager is standing right there
Last nite they were out of an entire appetizer section on the menu, the scantily dressed waitress/bartender told us she got yelled at for asking for bread for us, that they don't serve bread
Both times I sat in the lounge area which is very appealing, but right in front of the bar, which explains my frustration for being ignored while dropping a lot of money for decent food and wine
By the way there were only about 15 people in the entire place; not too rough on a Monday nite
If you don't care about service, then it's a nice place to meet for drinks
I found Loft's website on Citysearch while looking for a place to have a birthday party
and I am impressed! The decor is striking, the food was right on and the cocktails were amazing
We rented the downstairs lounge and it fit our large party of 100 or so perfectly
I am glad I found this place since the Upper West had been lacking in choices
Potentially a good spot, and the ambience is fine
But a case study on how lack of management will result in this place going out of business
Service is not malicious, just clueless
No training, almost as if the wait staff themselves had never eaten at a restaurant and had an inkling of what to do
Upstairs was noisy and had a good buzz at 9pm
We sat downstairs which is a good space, but by 11pm, it turns into a bar scene and the music volume ratchets up
Upstairs at 11pm is completely dead
Literally
So you need to know that there is a downstairs
again, lack of management
as written below, the drinks were watered down, and they didn't have the ginger martini available nor all of the wine list
again, lack of management  Good bar scene after 11pm, but if you are looking for a restaurant, go elsewhere
About 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd
Also the drinks were inconsistent and watered down
This place is new, and noticeable if you are from around this neighborhood because the old place at this location was such a dump
This place is the real deal down town looking and feeling type of place , but on the uws
The food and service are great the vibe is too cool compared to the usual uws restaurant / Lounge
Plus, the waittaff are not vapid out of work idiot models, they actually know what they are doing
The design is unique
Our food was good
Unusual menu, still accessible and friendly to those who want to explore and have some familiar things
The place was clean, maybe that was because its new
They had cool music playing, sort of a Continous DJ-Chill - Lounge -Mix of a lot of things, but it was a nice setting for the atmosphere, and you could talk and eat without yelling
My date and I were going to hit the bar next door, but way too crowded
Stepping outside, we peaked into the Loft from the window, looked ok from outside
We sat down on the couches infront
It wasn't crowded, ok with me
The bartender was friendly, took my order at the bar and delivered to the couch, along with a menu
We just got the crab fritters, which were amazing, and aside they gave us some house bread, which was delicious
Bus service was prompt, drinks were made well, and when walking to the bathroom downstairs, had to walk through the dining service, down steps to another lounge area with another bar
I was very impressed
I spoke w/the manager, he told me the chef was one from Spice Market (where I've been to before also)
Overall, the place seemed fine with me, I'd go back
We breezed into Loft last night (Saturday) and were told we'd have a ten minute wait to be seated without a reservation
We went to the front lounge/bar to wait and were immediatelt greeted by a friendly fellow who brought us drinks
Afew minute later the hostess came over and led us downstairs to the coolest, calmest, and beautifully lit room
Our waitress was prompt and not at all annoying
We had lamb, watercress salad, another Morrocan salad, and a big rib of some kind
Very unusual and savory food
We loved it
My two glasses of Shiraz were more than good enough
It was too expensive and too loud
I'd go back in a minute
I went to Loft for the first time this past weekend, and I was in awe
In comparison to Mod, the awful bar that used to be at the same location, this place is amazing
The decor is relaxing and inviting
There are couches in the front, and a great space downstairs
In between is a dinning room and an open kitchen
Finally someone is bringing a bit of downtown sensability to the usually bland Upper West Side bar and restaurant scene
Although downtown atmosphere also means donwtown prices
The drinks are a bit pricey, but you save on the cab fare downtown
The food is great
Most items on the menu are delicious
Try the papaya salad and the chicken and eggplant entrees
Portions are small but if you've got the dough to try a little of everything, go for it
The space is great, the service is friendly and for the most part attentive
The management however, leaves much to be desired
Whether or not they've actually run a restaurant before is unclear, but what is clear is that any forseeable problems in the future of this new restaurant will most likely stem down from the people making the decisions
If you're a local, stop in and check it out, but if not, stay downtown with me
Bon apetit
This is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and a wonderful dining experience overall
The breads are all baked fresh and served with fantastic hummus
I visited with a party of six and shared a number of appetizers: they were all great
The flatbreads are surprisingly tasty
The fish tangine is divine--a must try
Beyond the food, the architecture and design touches are impressive
(The bathroom is cool and worth a visit
)
Loft is a great addition to the upper west side
It has a great atmosphere, a refreshingly unique menu for both cuisine and drinks, and attractive decor
It is an enjoyable place to sit at the bar or on the comfortable couches for drinks with friends or enjoy a romantic meal
I have been here several times and am glad to have such a great place on the upper west side
Highly recommended
I was very suprised to find this restaurant on the upper west side
I usually dine downtown because there isn't a lot of atmosphere on the uws
Loft had plenty
The staff was attentive and the food was delicious
It also has great specialty drinks
This place is absolutely amazing
The food is delicious
The staff is friendly and very accomodating
I have been there several times and cant wait to go again
This is my family's favorite spot in Astoria
The bread comes out of the oven piping hot - cant get any fresher, the eggplant w/sauce is unparrelled and the fried shrimp is just perfect
The only down fall is at the end of it all you may hate yourself for overeating- you just cant stop- YUMMY!
The food here is okay, but not good enough for the prices or the service
There are far better restaurants in the area with wider menu selections and more competitive prices
The worst part of my experience here was the service

When I first entered, the host ignored me for roughly five minutes while he organized his reservation book even though I had a reservation
The waiter was rude and had an attitude
Upon leaving, when I asked the host where I could get my coat that I checked, he instructed me to walk through the entire restaurant to back near the restrooms where the coat check man has lounging
All the other customers had their coats brought to them
This place has the best cheesecake in America!!! The mousse is also out of this world
Try the fried artichokes and the pizza
You won't be disappointed
This was our 2nd time dining at Fiorello's and our opinion is the same
The food here really Rocks!!! From the appetizer (try the fresh buffalo mozzarella or the antipasti bar) to the Mista salad with shaved parmesean to the entrees to the desset
, OOh!! please try the chocolate mousse, it is heavenly
Wow! what a great meal
We were seated promptly and even though our waiter had a major attiude problem, the meal, the ambience and our previous visit, were the waiters were phenominal overshadows his cold and indifferent attitude
Also, make a reservation, it's a must
Oh! the best is
We sat at the booth in front of the actress who formerly played Alexandra Spaulding on The Guiding Light, cool
Service is definitely part of the experience in any restaurant, and I found the service to be exceptional at Fiorello's
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the hostesses, which in itself sets this place apart from some of the restaurants in New York
We were then treated to incredible service by a cheery and pleasant waiter named Joe
The food was fabulous and the dessert was even better
I highly recommend this place to those of you looking for a delicious meal minus the I'm-better-than-you attitude present in too many New York establishments
Its a tight fit, and the servers are pompus, but the food is tasty and quick
highly reccommend the brunch
Every month, when I visit NYC, I go from LaGuardia straight to Fiorello's
Mouth-watering vegetable side dishes and cold and well-seasoned seafood make it worthwhile
A friendly and competent waiter named Marcos is the plus that always makes this stop a great dining experience! Be sure to ask for him!
Went here to get some quick fettucine, but ended up being there for hours with a friend
Place is quite packed there, but friendly atmosphere
Would definitely go back
I love the tiramisu, also-- must have
Going back there tommorrow for the tiramisu to go!
Imet a friend here
I couldn't be more happy with this restaurant
Pasta bar was alittle to small on the portions but, very good recomend choosing your own
Tuna was cooked toperfection and huge
Enough for two people to share
Get the Zuppa it was out of this world
They give you on the house dessert wine take them up on it was yummy
I will definitly return and a good place to eat before you go to lincoln center, if you can get a table
One of Shelley Fireman's hallmark New yrok restaurants, Fiorello's is a favorite of mine
Recently when two good friends of mine came into town, we met each other at Lincoln Center, and then went to Fiorello's
I ordered a Margharita pizza, and we all dug in
The food is fantastic, and the wait staff is friendly and professional
Fiorello's is highly recommended!
I moved away from Manhattan a few years ago, but when I visit, I always make it a point to visit Fiorello's
The tuna is fantastic
the best I've ever had
The chocolate mousse is heavenly
As good as the food is, the service is even better
New outdoor seating is great for a nice Summer night outdoor meal
Inside ambience is very as you'd expect Italian, but very nice with good lighting and nice large tables and you don't feel crammed like most NYC restaurants
Staff is ultranice and friendly always coming by to check on us, wines by the glass are large enough to last a full meal, value was good and pasta was just perfect, not revolutionary just nice solid downhome good traditional pasta
One thing was are food was served so darn hot we had to wait like 5mis to touch it, not too bad a problem to have
Highly recommend as a great UWS close to home place for a nice solid Italian meal
After months of looking for a good Italian place and we finally found it! And believe me we had search
This place on the upper west side has the best pasta I had ever tasted
I had the first pasta listed on the menu and it left me craving the taste again for days after
I can't wait to go back and try everything on their menu
I happened upon this restaurant one cold, rainy night when it just looked too warm and inviting to pass up
The service here is always friendly
The food is always outstanding and the food is most definately worth the reasonable prices
Although the atmosphere is not trendy - the comfortable atmosphere makes it a great place for a date or meal with a friend
It's amazing how many italian restaurants in the city can screw up Italian food, and this is all the more a reason to keep coming back to Pappardella - the food is always outstanding, the service attentive, and while the restaurant is open, it still feel cozy and intimate
I particularly love the bolognese sauce on the pasta which is always done al dente
And the tartuffo there is the best I've had in ages! My one wish would be for a more inventive wine list
Given so many different kinds of wine all over Italy, some whimsical selections would be fun to explore
But overall Pappardella is fantastic and worth returning to!
The service here is extraordinary! I have no idea of what that one user was talking about when they said that 'it lacked' or something, because all of the busboys, waiters, waitresses, bartenders, and even the restaurant manager came over to accomodate us in any way possible
Between their concern for our satisfaction, the way they allowed us to switch tables, and get the food to us immediately was terrific
I highly recommend this wonderful restaurant to everyone!
I love this restaurant
The cold antipasta is great and they serve the best gnocci in Manhattan! It is cooked perfectly
slightly al dente
The food is also reasonably priced
Great atmosphere too
whether you're inside (exposed brick walls) or people watching outside
Nice decor with good pasta dishes
Stick with the basics
Service lacks
I had a tremendously intimate dinner with my girlfriend last Thursday at Pappardella
In fact, our evening went so well, that I just had to write about it
I tend to travel quite a bit, as does my girlfriend
However, when we are in New York, we like to dine at Pappardella when we are on the Upper West Side
Well, when we entered the place this past Tuesday, we liked the place even more! The open-brick restaurant seems to have washed itself in an elegant sea of Christmas decorations and white lights!! You just dont want to leave because it's that intimate, warm and inviting! And I havent even gotten to the food yet! The fare here is truly fantastic, but its the ambiance that they have created that I am trying to point out
Anyhow, for an intimate evening with a loved one, Pappardella comes highly rated!!
Deco was very nice
The service and food did nothing to set itself apart from the numerous other neighborhood Italian restaurants
The Scene With locations directly across the street from the 84th Street and 68th Street Sony multiplexes, Ollie's rakes in the Upper West Side pre-movie crowd
Ollie's 84th can't boast much atmosphere--its closely packed tables are often full, and the room's loud
But because of its quick service, reasonable prices, tasty food and skewered ducks hanging in the front window, few people complain
The Food Try the wonderfully greasy scallion pancakes, which are guaranteed to stay with you all the way through the movie
Other favorites include the wonton soup with roast pork and the chicken with scallion and ginger
Watch out for the sesame noodles, though, and leave the complimentary pickled cabbage and carrots sitting on the table for the next customer to enjoy
We were in New York June 18-24 and ate here twice
It was great, everything we had on both nights was really good
I wish I could have eaten here another time
The Chow Fun was excellent and the soups we had, had really good flavor and lots of Bbq Pork
solid food at a solid price
dependable chinese food, quick delivery, fresh veggies--- i always order from this place and i keep on coming back
i have a friend who flies in from jacksonville florida and insists on either eating at ollie's or a fancy steak house around town
ollie's is obviously the more economical option

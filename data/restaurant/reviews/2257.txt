The waffle was just terrible--virtually inedible
We talked to the waiter and the manager, trying to figure out what was wrong, but they were extraordinarily unhelpful
We ended up paying $51 for those three uneaten waffles, and the management did nothing to compensate for the terrible food
I was so disappointed
Norma's really fell down on the job this time
My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast, the eggs are to die for
I ordered the Country pancakes with peaches and walnuts
delicious and excellent
This compliment is coming from someone who usually only eats only her OWN pancakes
I usually hate anyone's pancakes, but these pancakes are excellent
Tha bacon and my orange juice is also good
The service is excellent, and we waited only ten minutes for our meals
Norma's
keep up the good work
I ate bruch on a weekday in early July 2005
Although tables were available the maitre d' makes you wait while he runs your name through his reservation system
There is an additional 5 to 8 minute wait while he does this
After being seated the waiter was prompt with coffee and taking my order
However, my order of eggs benedict arrived with eggs hard boiled
The waiter took the order back but he the second serving came back on soggy english muffins with the eggs only slightly runny
For $19 in a place that specializes in breakfast I did expect perfect eggs benedict
This is my second disappointment at this restaurant and I will not return
Before reviewing the food, I want to briefly mention the service
Norma's has the best service I have seen in a restaurant, whether in or outside NY
Our waiter knew exactly how to make our experience perfect, without our having to ask for it
Whether it was bringing an extra plate for us to share food, or brining in an extra free sample when we really liked the first, he did everything right
The food itself is very good
I would not say it's outstanding
The portions are huge
Consider splitting one dish rather than ordering two
The duck dish could easily feed a family
I haven't had the fruit salad but I will next time because it looks amazing
The place costs too much for a breakfast place, but it was an excellent experience, and I will come back
P

There are no lines in the afternoon
HOORAY! Norma's is now a CHILD-FREE ZONE! Children are NOT ALLOWED AT NORMA'S ANYMORE!!!! That means you can now enjoy your breakfast without hearing crying babies, screaming children
I was so delighted when the hostess informed a couple with the most poorly behaved children, that this was an Establishment for Adults and children over the age of 13 only
Waited about 45 minutes without a reservation
There are no Handsome baritone Nordic waiters patroling the room, Coffee is now $5
00 per person
However, the Chocloate Banana Napoleon, Chocolate decadence French Toast, Breakfast Quesadilla and the Extra Cheesy French toast were out of this world!
I used to love Norma's- went maybe once every month or so
I went two weeks ago and after waiting the customary wait, we had to wait another 30 minutes before someone even came to give us coffee and then another 15 minutes to place our order
I didn't leave since I was starving and I thought that the meal would be worth the wait
The food and service sucked and while I never complained before about paying a lot for a good brunch, it pained me to have to pay for the crappy service and poorly prepared good
I'd rather go to IHOP, if there was one in the city
No doubt this is breakfast on a higher level with prices to match, but nobody can deny that Norma's does breakfast just about better than anybody in NYC
Rock lobster and sauteed asparagus omelette, banana macadamia nut flapjacks with whipped banana brown sugar butter or brioche styled french toast with fresh seasonal berries are just a few of the creative breakfast dishes on Norma's menu
All diners get a free shot of the day's selected smoothie
A wait is inevitable at Norma's so take a seat in the hotel lobby and relax with a cup of complimentary coffee
Definitely worth the wait! The food is worth every penny! When you order French toast you get FRENCH TOAST It's uasually smothered with roasted carmelized nuts, fresh fruit, and your choice of syrup
Although we had a reservation through OpenTable, we were made to wait 30 minutes in the least comfortable hotel lobby I've experienced
When we finally were invited to sit, we waited over an hour for our food
Under any circumstances, this treatment is not acceptable, no matter how good the restaurant claims its food is
While the food is indeed good, it's expensive, and the wait is very, very long for both your table and the meal
We went there on an average day, and it took us twice as long to get a table as they thought it would, and then the food (two orders of French toat) took over half hour to be delivered
The bill for breakfast, two long hours later, was almost $70; so so so so not worth it
Although I had made reservations, I still had to wait 30 minutes until being seated
The hostess was standoffish and told us several times that it would only be a few minutes
The waiter was incompetent and did not do anything unless asked to
He was highly inattentive and clearly ignored other table's attempts as well as our own to catch his attention
We had to wait 45 minutes after ordering until we got our food, which was definitely not worth the wait, price, and horrible service combined
Don't waste your time or money at Norma's
Food good, place nice, hostess RUDE! Expect a 2 hour wait on weekends! While waiting you can always run to Starbucks across the street for a cup of java and a scone while waiting for your table
Don't bring a large group here
I keep going back to Norma's b/c it's so much fun to try their innovative dishes -- the chocolate french toast, the lobster asparagus omelette, the crepe roulades, the egg white frittata
The only thing I didn't enjoy tremendously was the crunchy french toast -- innovative, yes, but it didn't work
Otherwise the service multi-tasks rather well considering the place is constantly overflowing
Yes it's pricey just don't order the $7 orange juice and drink the free smoothie that's provided, don't feel obliged to order a whole one
And make a reservation!
We didn't have to wait for a table, but that was the only good thing about our meal
Took the waiter 10 minutes to get to our table, and another 15 minutes until the coffee I ordered arrived
The waiter wasn't unpleasant, but his smile seemed forced and condescending
The food was mediocre, and definitely not worth the inflated prices
Atmosphere cold and forbidding
I would not return
I have to say, this was probably the rudest service I have ever received in NYC yet
After being told there was a 20 minute wait, we proceeded to wait 55 minutes
At that point I asked the hostess where we were in the list and she told us we would be another 35 minutes
When I asked why she was sitting other groups, who had clearly come in after us, she barked i don't have time to deal with this
just go stand over there until i call your name, and then proceeded to ignore me when i tried to talk to her
To say i was annoyed would be an understatement
Maybe she should consider another line of employment, as she clearly does not have the basic skills for this job
Norma's is my favorite brunch restaurant in NYC
I've taken numerous people to Norma's and recommended others and it never fails to impress people by the quality of the food, the portions, and the ambience
I've been three times and I won't visit the city again without a trip to Norma's
My waiter had the attention span of a cocker spaniel and all of the smooth, hard, pretty surfaces can make for a noisy room, but my $14
00 pancakes were top notch and the selection was excellent
Everyone can find something to like here
Food was good (not the best)
Very pricey for breakfast
2 of us had fruit bowl, 2 entrees, 2 smoothies total bill with tip $86
00
Seemed like alot for breakfast
Cute space, but come on! $4 for bad coffee??!! The food was decent, but really overpriced
What we need in NYC is a good ole' International House of Pancakes (aka IHOP)
Until then, I'll stay home make my own blueberry pancakes
Hard to beat Norma's for a big, phat, late breakfast
Portions were huge the wait staff was gracious attentive

Never had anything that wasn't good here
Nice seafood and past dishes
Not cheap but then quality or quantity isn't either
Atmosphere can be a little intimidating or unfriendly at first b/c staff or regulars seem to concentrate at the bar
I stumbled on this jewel while doing some business across the street
What a wonderful place
Small, quaint, warm and friendly
Food was good, not too crowded or noisy, just an enjoyable experience
The owner was inviting and kind and kept coming over to the table to ask how things were
I will make sure to come back to Ivy's the next time I am in the neighborhood
I have yet to be disappointed when dining at Ivy Bistro
The menu is always so innovating, the food so fresh, and at prices that reflect the early 90's
Steve, the owner, is an incredible personality who is loved by everyone
If you have had a bad day you will be quickly transformed out of that bad mood
This place attracts people from all walks of life, celebrities,and locals alike
Not touristy at all
Had dinner here recently after a friend recommended it to me
Rather small, cramped space, but then again it was about 7:00, crowded and there were lots of cronies at the bar who looked like they had been there most of the day! Service was fine, but the food was far below what I expected
Calamari very spongy, pasta bland
Wine was OK
I read about the chef in Time Out (Ralph something?) and I think he needs to go back to cooking school compared to how they raved about him in the review
I eat here at least 4 times a month
The food never dissapoints and the atmosphere is great
You have an eclectic mix of people though it is skewed to the financial side by virtue of Citicorp's headquarters 200 feet away
Take my word for it and make friends with the owner, Steve! You'll understand after meeting him
Going again tonight!
Pros: Great service, sweet and very attentive waiters
I had an AMAZING lemony, garlicky peppery linguine with white clam sauce, my iced tea never got a chance to get cold, and they had us out in under an hour so we could get back to work
I'm definitely going back! Cons: Not the most romantic location, although they've done a nice job with the decor- it looks like the inside of a clubhouse at a country club in the Hamptons
The Scene From the street, the smattering of sidewalk tables and dim, cafe-like interior are perfectly deceptive: The back of the restaurant bends into an abrupt right angle, leading to a canopied back patio
The ladies lunch regularly here, as do families, nearby workers and business folk
At night, tiny Christmas lights illuminate the outdoor space, making it feel like a Roman piazza
The friendly service can be a little slow during the crowded peak lunch hour
The Food If you can't decide what to get from the long menu, look around--chances are you'll see something you like on a neighboring table
The rigatoni alla vodka is firm and creamy, and dishes like pollo rollatina (prosciutto-stuffed chicken) are fresh and tasty
The woodfired pizzas
while not thin crust wonders, come crowned with fresh mozzarella, light, tangy sauce, and a wide array of toppings
For dessert, you can't beat a towering, fluffy baked cheesecake and the free zeppoles
Wonderful restaurant- great service
We had a large group and they did everything in their power to help us- even when we changed the number of people in our group twice
They made mother's day wonderful
And the food is amazing- try the gnocchi
I think that restaurants in Little Italy have gotten a bad rap- but this place is great
I took a friend visiting from out of town to Da Nico
A few years ago the food and service was excellent
However, upon entering we were treated terribly and I was disgusted by the attitude
We were eventually seated but decided to leave
The wait staff there obviously did not want to do their jobs and the blasting New York, New York over the speakers made it seem like a horrible tourist trap
This was a huge diffference from the wonderful service and welcoming, warm attitude from the past
Please do not bother---tourists and resident New Yorkers, no matter how young or old will be treated like crap!
Went to Da Nico's on Saturday night with a group
The food is very dependable, Italian-American food - home-cooked, and fresh but not gourmet quality (i
e
no Babbo), safe to go with a large group of people with varying tastes
We were seated within 15 minutes, and our waiter seemed nice, offering us a free bruschetta appetizer
However, he was a bit unscrupulous - pushing us hard to order the most expensive wine and offering us an appetizer sampler when we sat down which wasn't much food and charging us $80 for it
Would probably return, but be careful of the waiters trying to rack up the bill through unscrupulous methods
This place was absolutely awesome
Come for good food, excellent and friendly service, energetic, and fun atmosphere
A great vibe and even better food
I would recomend trying to get a reservation, (we did not) but they do take walk-ins
We had to wait an hour but it was well worth it
The wine list as well as the Amarone selection was an added bonus
Food is astonishing, I ordered Veal Chop Martino and it was the best dish I ever had in my life
If you crave good food and exciting atmosphere you should check it out
This does not taste like Italian food at all
We ordered some standard dishes, and it does not tastes like Italian food, it tastes like microwave dishes
Worse is the waitstaff, obviously not Italian, trained in this horrible faux Italian supermario accent
Please, for the love of God, show some courtesy to your customers, I am not here to play American baseball, I don't like catching the food you throw at me
The wine is flat, and the food is just inexcusably unflattering
This is surely a restaurant aim solely for tourists who has no idea what real Italian real
This place is neither of love of food nor people
Given the high ratings I am not sure how they earn it, price is not cheap for the type of food and service you get
The waiters are very unprofessional, and when you complain to the manager, he doesn't seem to care either
On top of that, they add 20% gratuity at the end of your bill when it is not stated in the menu that gratuity would be added
The food sucks too
This place is the worst italian restaurant I have ever been to
I went with a couple of friends while some others have not arrived, but the receptionist bring us to a table and let us have the seat first
When the waiter arrive, we told him we were still waiting, and he said I am not suppose to hold the table like this and walked away
That was very rude
After that, the waitor did not serve us well
When we ordered, he did not tell us the special of the night and was rushing and showed impatience when someone asked him questions
Food was no good as well
I ordered garlic bread, but the bread is only covered in cheese with no garlic taste
Pasta has no flavor, not real Italian food
This is the worst experience I ever had
Will never go back to this restaurant again
My friends and I were walking around Little Italy and came upon this place and the took us right in and the service was wonderful
The food was very good and so was the wine
I highly reccomend Da Nico!
dealing with rude staff, i highly recommend Da Nico
Service is the worst i've ever experienced in the world
The waiter was rude tossing menus at us and ignoring any requests for service
The highlight occured when a bus boy brought over dessert plates for us, we told him we hadnt ordered any dessert
He then said it was complimentary
So the waiter strolled back and asked if we want to order dessert
Confused, we told him the bus boy said there was complimentary dessert, he just said NOPE and walked away
He returned with the check and we asked again
He then yelled at us, saying So you came here for complimentary dessert?!? while we were responding, the waiter had to nerve to yell again
BE QUIET, JUST BE QUIET

we would have been content to stay here and view the inner workings of the kitchen
We were sat where we proceeded to devour everything on the menu
the pear salad was my personal fav as well as the chicken roll
Our main dishes were all amazing
the lamb shank is out of this world! the waiters were wonderfully accomodating for a birthday cake being brought to the table
The desserts were so unique and tasty
Waiters also passed out Warm chocolate chip cookies table to table
Super Sweet touch!  Such a great night out
we will never forget the extra effort put forth here to make this night so memorable
Gorgeous decor,Awesome food,great staff
Such a beautiful dining experience
great looking space
flustered unknowledgeable wait staff
vietnamese spring rolls mediocre in every way - shaking beef moo shoo rolls appetizer excellent but when's the last time you had something bad that was lathered in hoisin sauce? and $15 bones? won't be having that again
Duck breast entree good if by good you mean fatty fat-fat
my wife liked the cod
overall, the value for money of this place was pretty weak
Although very sleek and airy, the food was underwhelming and the service was average
We were expecting more pizazz in the flavor department
Our chosen fare was inconsistent for sure and bland mostly
The Vietnamese spring rolls were languid, but the the Moo Shoo beef appetizer was sublime
The Lamb entre was very nicely cooked, but the Red Snapper was a bore
On a busy night -- such as we experienced -- dinner table converstion was a strain over the undampened sound that reverberates in the oh-so-cool interior landscape
On a quiet mid-week eve, I'd bet that the sushi bar is the best place to hang-out
Go once
Say you did it
Move on
We went the other night with a couple of friends and a great time
As soon as we walked in we knew that this was going to be fun
We were greated right away by the hostess who was real nice and she told us it would be a few
We waited at the bar for about 15 minutes for our table
The back room was very cool and we got a great table
The server was on it and the food was really good
The neat thing was everyone else seemed to be having as good a time as we were, the place has a great vibe and good looking people
Dont listen to what some of the other posters said
We will go back again and again
Oh and dont forget to check out the best bathrooms I have ever been in
After having to wait over 45 minutes (having made a reservation), we were poorly served mediocre food (the infamous ribs had small bones throughout)
The drinks were nothing special and the ambience was decent; best of all were the 30/40 year old teenibobber wannabees hovering about, offering intermittent pretentious stares
Overall, definitely not worth the money
I'm an average guy that likes good food whatever the cost
Frankly, Sapa LOOKS awesome: great interior design, funky atmosphere, beautiful people (staff and otherwise)
But the food sucks majorly! The service sucks majorly! And the coat check lady was the only person with a smile on her face and a courteous and friendly attitude
says a lot about the place
And did i say the food sucks? Thanks for the new and funky restaurant, but go there for drinks only and then go somewhere else to eat
What a waste of everything
Went there for valentines day, they gave us a table by the door after I made a reservation weeks in advance for a good table, allright
Then they moved us to a table by the wall, allright
The food was undercooked, they service was confused, and it tasted horrible
Allright
It was the loudest restaurant I have ever been too, i would go there for happy hour, but not a romantic date
Allright
We were leaving and then they lost my scarf, took them 30 minutes to find it
Dont waste your time here, its overhyped, over priced, and not worth it
3 of my girlfriends and I were all excited about going to Sapa
We made reservations at 8:30pm on a Thursday night, and guess what!!!! Don't expect to be seated right away!!! We waiting for ONE HOUR!!!! And the Hostess had an attitude whenever we would check in with her
She was saying that people do wait for seats for 45-1hr even with a reservation!! So we finally get seated, and ofcourse the food was not as spectacular as we would think,,, OVERALL,, NOT Worth the WAIT, and not WORTH the $$$ either
The decor is beautiful, especially since unexpected for the neighborhood
Don't agree with previous reviews re: the service as our waiter was extremely helpful in pointing the specialties and was very patient with everyone in our party while we made our selections - we were a total of 8
The appetizers were very tasty, especially the cocoa spareribs
The entrees, as in most restaurants in the city were less impressive
My duck was undercooked and even though I sent it back, it returned pretty much the same way
Another friends' monkfish had no taste at all
Overall, I do recommend this restaurant for its decor and appetizers but the entrees need a lot of work
Last night I had one of my best meals in a long time
I'm a big fan of Patricia Yeo!! We arrived for the first time at the large, beutifully designed space and had cocktails at the bar before sitting down to dinner
The staff was friendly and attentive as we waited for our table and sipped on Cosmojitos (which I reccomend)
The food was delicious and memorable (lobster, moo-shu, duck, tuna financier)
Our waiter Scott added that little extra something to our night
My wife and I will be back
I was really impressed with the Chef Patricia Yeo's food
The servers were very attentive and especiall helpful with the menue
Our whole table had a great time in a very hip place
I went to Sapa with low expectations, and came away with a new favorite restaurant
The beef watercress roll is deliciously subtle, and the cod in parchment is so well presented that I'm surprised I don't see it at more restaurants
The knowledgeable staff made me feel welcomed and comfortable
The space is beautiful, open and airy
Don't let the critics fool you
Eat and Sapa and you'll become a believer too
We work directly across the street, we live locally
The crowd is pretty but not pretentious, cozy but classy enough for business lunches and dinners, friendly and accomodating enough for family gatherings
Very friendly staff, lovely decorated, the atmosphere is superb
We had some drinks in the lounge before being seated at our table
We didn't want to get up
The menu was interesting and well described, and the staff was available to fill in the blanks
The wine list, umm, I'm still Dizzy, but the manager helped us out, thanks Jess
All our food was so beautifully prepared, it looked almost too good to eat
Everything was very tasty and was pleasing to all the senses
Dessert was oh so good
The Chocolate Chili Bomb
not like most places where the chocolate dessert is just that, Chocolate
It was nicely textured and flavorful and beautifully presented
I have to say, i wasnt quite prepared for just how good the food was here
Perhaps it was the fact that the interior is so spacious and elegant that you can easily forget you are in NYC, but the food ranks with the best menus ive encountered
I highly recommend it for a date or a small group
Its really a gem thats worth discovering before everyone else does
I was so looking forward to Patricia Yeo's restaurant
Especially after I just watche her cook up a storm with Bobby Flay on the last Iron Cef America episode
I ordered almost everything on the menu and loved it all
the soup, beef moo shu, green papya salad, tuna, duck, chix, lamb, even the veg plate

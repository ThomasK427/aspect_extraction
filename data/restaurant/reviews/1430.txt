Your soup plus the piece of baguette, chocolate, and fruit make a full meal
I get it as often as possible
I used to travel great distances to get the Seafood/Shrimp/Lobster Bisque at the original International Soup Kitchen on West 55th
And I'm happy for Al the soup guy with this whole franchise thing
But the quality is nowhere near what it was
Recently had the Shrimp Bisque at one of these satellites and it tasted mass produced, cut with too much cream, not as many chunks, and what chunks it had didn't taste as fresh
Maybe that's the cost of lowering the prices
The same meal at the main shop would've cost about $4 more
Out of loyalty, I'll go back and try other things in hopes of capturing that greatness again
I don't like to rate franchises too often because I find they are always one and the same
What makes this Jamba a little different from the rest is that its bigger, better, and has excellent service
Each time I've come in I've been greated by an employee, Welcome to Jamba Juice! I've also realized the facility includes bathrooms (not all JJs have one) a large drinking / waiting area and two entrances (on each side)
And of course since its Times Square, its vamped to be more beautiful than most other areas
the savory muffins are wonderful! the chai tea is too sweet and not homemade like everything else
im sure the coffee is good, although a bit expensive
DELICIOUS food
Lovely ambience
This place has everything but soundproof walls -- it's hard to escape the street noise of Little Italy
Curry quite good
Seitan -- black pepper and also teriyaki are delicious
Spinach shumai is surprisingly good
Mango salsa on scallion pancakes also good appetizer options
Eggplant in garlic sauce is ok
If you don't like spicy food, beware-- it has a MAJOR kick
Their ginger drink is awesome, in a gentle and soothing way
All in all
this place makes eating vegetarian easy and fun to do
Went to Wild Ginger for lunch this past weekend and it was quite simply the best vegetarian food I have ever had
In fact, I loved the smoked teriyaki seitan sugar snap-peas so much, that I had to go back the next day
I was torn with so many delicious-sounding choices, but the sweet sour sesame soy protein was fantastic - tasted, looked, and had the exact texture of sweet and sour chicken
The lunch specials, served from noon to 4pm, are a real bargain
They range in price from $6 to $8 and include miso soup, steamed pumpkin, brown rice or coconut rice, and a spring roll
The presentation is clean and fresh, and the service was phenomenal
I recommend this restaurant to vegetarians and to non-vegetarians
I can't wait to go back to New York to try something else on the menu!!
Yummy! Yummy! Wild Ginger is a vegetarian's dream restaurant! Lots of choices!!! General Tsao's chicken was, by far, the best meal at our table
I highly recommend this restaurant
This restaurant is a true find
The ambience is both cozy and incredibly unique, with green moss on the exposed brick walls and window decorations made with exotic foods
The food was very fresh and high in flavor
The highlight was the hand made ginger ale, which was worth a return trip for the drink alone
Just the right balance of sweetness with a ginger kick
Food is creative, and pleasing to the eyes and to the palate
AND its all vegan!
even got WOW's from non veg dining partners
Last night I visited Wild Ginger in person after ordering delivery for the last few months
Although I love eating at home (Spinach Rolls with Ponzu go great with Desperate Housewives), I've discovered it's worth a 10 minute walk from my place for the ambiance alone! My boyfriend is vegetarian and I am decidedly not, and after years of dating, I can honestly say that Wild Ginger is the ONLY place we've ever eaten where neither of us feels as though we're making a compromise
The delicious, artfully prepared food is consistently excellent and dare I say, addictive, and the only time I ever remember it's healthy is when I'd rather chide myself for eating too much! Everything on the menu is sublime, and I happily take friends who are carnivores, vegan, or anything in-between there knowing that they'll leave with a new favorite
Best of all, it's a bargain!
This cozy, but not cramped, little Pan-Asian Vegetarian restaurant is a real find
It's almost completely vegan, with a knowledgable staff ready to answer any questions and make suggestions
Some of the menu choices are familiar (scallion pancakes, shu mai), while others are new twists on old favorites (glazed seitan over sugar snap peas with coconut rice--wow!)
Everything I've tried so far has been delicious
The two flavors of soy ice cream (vanilla-ginger and black sesame) are out of this world
I've gone several times, both with friends and in large groups, and I'm never disappointed
When you get tired of pizza pasta in Little Italy, head over to Wild Ginger!
I've been in to Miharu Sushi twice now and each time it keeps getting better
We visited Miharu Sushi as it is close to our apartment
The food here is good and the service is excellent
We tried some special appetizers everytime we visited and watched some amazing looking dishes being prepared for other tables
We want to try them on our next visit
This place is wonderful - the menu is unique and delicious
And the price is so reasonable if compared with others Japanese Restaurant in the city
You will find me there again and again!
This place is really great
Their wait-staff is very attentive (refills of green tea and water as needed), the place is clean and decorated very tastefully
The bathrooms are new and spotless
More importantly, the sushi is amazing
The pieces of sushi are much larger than your average sushi restaurant and the prices are reasonable
Some of the rolls are more expensive ($12-$15), but pretty darn fancy! Very original combinations
They do take out and delivery as well
Definitely going back
great burger, l work in the area and its great to have a cool fun and delicious diner best tuna on rye in the city
Went for early dinner on a Sunday, place was half empty but still took 30 minutes for a burger which was overdone and terrible
The rest of our food wasn't much better
Note to the owner, please bring back Chango!
I went here for brunch a few weeks ago and the service was awful, taking over 2 hours just for coffee and eggs
A few days later I decided to give the delivery a shot and see if it was better than the service
I ordered a simple salad and i only live about 3 blocks away
After an hour had passed I called and they said there was only one delivery guy there that night but it would be there any minute
After another hour passed, I called them to say I no longer wanted my salad 2 hours later, and they didnt even seem appologetic, I have a feeling things like that happen often! So unless you want to eat about 2 hours after you order I would stay away from this place!
Very nice make over! the food is great, extensive menu, yummy big cakes, milk shakes great burgers and salads! I am a die hard fan of Duke's and am glad Big Daddy's is now part of the mix on Park Ave South! The upstairs room is great for a private get together of 25 friends or so!
Just wanted to chime in I LOVE THIS PLACE
The service is great
The wait for a table(with 9 people in the group) was short
It's good old fashioned simple unpretentious diner food
Do not go if you expect braissed, pan-seared, truffles, more than one fork, or any fish other than tuna
It's also bright, cheerfull, and welcoming
And the price is perfect
The portions are filling without being overwhelming
We were looking for something for a Sunday brunch this time, and came upon Big Daddy's Diner
At 11:30, we were seated immediately, but around noon, there was a line out the door
We ordered from the Brunch menu
I had the eggs benedict, and they were very good (the side of fried potatos were luke warm, but tasty)
One of my dining partners had the pancakes
She rated them very high due to the carmelized bananas on top
Our other diner ordered the Nova Scotia lox and eggs which she rated as good
The service was attentive despite the fact it was packed
The decor was cute (retro), but because of the crowd, a bit noisy
The prices of the brunch items were very good, but we did notice that the prices of the non-brunch items were a little steep

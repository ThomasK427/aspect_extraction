We highly recommend the shrimp with hot peppers, cantonese crab, and lomein
Food is delicious, service is quick, and location is great for visitors to Chinatown
Very casual, not for special occasions or if you're looking for ambiance but the food is first rate
Okay, so the bathroom is a little scary and the milieu brings to mind an old diner or cafeteria, but simply put, the food here is the best
Anytime, anywhere
For lunch, for dinner, post all night bacchanalia, Hop Kee is to die for
My last meal would definitely consist of their spicy/salty pork and squid
I moved from New York in 1984 to Southeastern Massachusetts,and it is always worth the trip to Hop Kee,The steamed Dumplings are the best!,also the Wor Wonton Soup
The Seafood can't be Beat!
Old style Cantonese restaurant
They have the best seafood in Chinatown
Started going there for seafood ever since childhood
If other Chinatown restaurant owners go to HopKee for their seafood
that says a lot
Love the lobster, crabs, and traditional Cantonese soup! No fancy tablecloths, the concentration is on food
It might not look like much but you don't know what you're missing
I've been going to this restaurant since I was a little kid
Now whenever i'm in the city i stop in here
The food comes in heaping amount plus it's cheap and tastes really good
You can't go wrong with anything that you order
If you can make it here during dim sum time that's a bonus
Also make some room for their sweet buns
Yum Yum
My husband I were celebrating our wedding anniversary happened to be in Little Italy when they closed the streets celebrating the World Cup
Bad weather kept the crowds away, and we were able to score an inside table for two at Buona Notte around 9pm on a Saturday night
The atmosphere was DEFINITELY casual (I think we were overdressed), and the clientele ranged from families w/ children, BT people, to women out for the night with their girlfriends
Service was prompt and attentive, and the menu was standard for an Italian restaurant in Little Italy
After the obligatory bread butter, our appetizer came within mere minutes of placing the order, and the entree was delivered in a timely manner
The sauce on the calamari was amazing, and the gnocchi w/ tomato/basil/mozzarella was delicious
We weren't blown away with the food, but we definitely received excellent value for the money and the portions were nothing to sneeze at
We were not able to finish our entrees and wrapped them to go
We declined coffee/dessert, and our check was presented with little fanfare and a positive attitude
The remaining plates were cleared quickly and efficiently
The only thing I would recommend is the server OFFER the guest the winelist (we had to ASK to see it), and perhaps have the dessert menu (or card) presented separately from the main appetizer/entree menu
The dessert selections were indiscriminately placed on the menu and we had to search for them
In any case, we WILL be back, perhaps even with our children!
food is about the same as all the places in little italy, not bad for the price
the service here is awful, rude waiters, not on top of things, like filling a water glass, bringing the bill (the waiters job)
I've tried it twice, not impressed
Me and a friend were recommended this place by our hotel and it was great! They were very welcoming and the service was wonderful
If you have never been to Little Italy, try this place, you will not be dissapointed!
The food is out of this world
I strongly recommend it!
The food, service and seating was horrible
Most restaurants are not very spacious in Little Italy, but this was the worst I have ever seen, almost sitting in the laps of the people next to us! Don't waste your time or money, instead travel further into Little Italy for a better dining experience!
Had lunch here
Baked clams were ok
I had penne with mushrooms, sun dried tomates, olive oil, and garlic
Was ok not great
Service was a little slow
The chocolate mousse cake was horrible
Not the best place
You can find better
My wife and I used to love this place but then we went there on a Monday night and will never go again
The food is OK and I loved the rolled up veal but the service is horrible
The waiter forgot to bring the appetizer and wouldn't give us the check when my wife asked for it he kept offering more things, even after we repeatedly stated that we were full
Finally we had to get up and befgin to move towards the door to get the check rushed over to us
With so many other places within a couple of yards you may as well skip this place
i ate here 3 years ago and the food was bad then
i thought it might be better now
it wasn't
my sister and i ate here last night
we actually tried to go to other restaurants in little italy but they were packed
buona notte wasn't and i see why
i had the bowtie pasta with salmon in a cream sauce and she had the boneless chicken w/ sausage in a garlic or wine sauce, i forget
my pasta was not creamy, in fact it was quite watery
her chicken was mediocre and we both didn't finish our meals
even though we didn't like it, we had our food wrapped to go because we were annoyed that we had to pay for such crap
weird logic i know
don't go there
recently ate at the buona notte and this place is a gem
from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave you feel like you are at home
the food is fabulous and the price is unbelievable
the owner, matt is all over the place making sure everything is in order
a great wine list and of course, once again a bargain
from the stuffed artichoke, fresh mozzarella, all pastas and some of the best veal i ever tasted, you are in heaven dining at this gem on mulberry street
try this absolutely fabulous restaurant, you will definitely not be disappointed
I've been to Buona Notte several times
Each time the food was simply delicious, and the service was excellent and professional
Prices are very reasonable while portions are generous
I tell my friends about this place all the time
i'v been there a couple of times, and always a very good service ,good food, waiters are nice and friendly, they have a beautifull garden in the back, nice music and big portions,that is what I call place to enjoy and for an hour be a KING
I went there for Fathers Day and it was THE WORST! The waiter was rude and would'nt bring us what we asked for
Not only that as we were eating our appetizers he was sitting behind us with other coworkers eating their meal
Very unprofessional
The waiters are pigs, they stare at the women and talk about the customers
I will NEVER go back there again!
We were in Buona Notte more than one times,and never had a bad meal
The staff is always very friendly and they have a great ambiance
As regulars we always look to go back there,usually at night for dinner
We love it!
I can't believe anyone gave this place even a halfway decent review
The food is Chef Boyardee all the way! The 'service' people (and I use that term lightly, because you can't really call what they do here service) are all either really rude or absolutely incompetent
It's almost like they are trying to make customers as uncomfortable as possible
Don't go to Buona Notte if you want to have a good experience
Gone here a few times - not all that impressed with the food
Blah in flavor, but HUGE portions
Nice back room for large groups, and garden seating out back, but inside it gets very loud, especially with the kitchen located between the front and back room
This is the worst restaurant I've been to in Little Italy
The food was mediocre, the staff are all unbelievably rude

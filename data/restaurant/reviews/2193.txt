Thje food was alright and the service was less than adequate
And for the price, I was not happy at all
First time there was for a late lunch
No one was in the restaurant and I dont think our server was half the time either
She was not attentive and our drinks were empty for a long time
Second time was happy hour
We had to go to the bar from our tables to get our drinks and then sat there with empty wine glasses trying to flag down a server as they kept looking at our empty glasses as they walked by
Finally had to flag someone down for the check
Couldnt wait to leave
Too bad, it is such a nice location and atmosphere
And the food was pretty good
Great for a romantic dinner or with a large group of friends
The best seats are close to the windows which are from floor to ceiling and offer a view of the park and lush greenery
It's closeness to Times Square makes it ideal location
had a great time there one weekend during the summer, food was edible, but after several bottles of wine it was great
a good place to be with friends and enjoy the outdoors
Ive been to Bryants Park twice with two different girlfriends
Although the food is not the greatest it is much better than at other places around town
The ambiance is plainly enchanting
both romantic and cozy enough that I did not feel uncomfortable sharing dinner with a non-date
Worth trying the $25 prefix dinner which was great the first time I went
Great on any beautiful day but Thursday, gets way too crowded then
The setting is beautiful
Open sky, fresh air, green grass are all wonderful
However, this place gets so packed that you can't move
Go on a Monday night when the crowd is thinner
It's so crowded that that alone is a turn off
Great Place to go after work in the summer, thursday's are better than some nights
although the food is less than desirable, I say stay for drinks but definitely don't ask for anything complicated cause chances are your drink will be wrong
Can't beat the location on a nice summer night, with a breeze and music in the park
So what if the food is so - so?
My two companions and I agreed that the food was mediocre; it really didnt help that I found a large piece of plastic wrap in my vegetable sandwich (which was really a Portobello mushroom sandwich)
For what I was paying for that sandwich, the kitchen should have been more careful
As for drinks: $6
50 for a bottle of Corona? Give me a break
It is one thing to mark up the price of a product; it is another to rip customers off
The next time I return to the Park I will definitely bring a picnic meal
This place is great to enjoy a nice glass of wine while overlooking the park, but that's it
Don't bother with the food or the drinks
Also, the bar area could use a facelift of its own
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

We were strolling aroung in Greenwich Village on a Friday night in search of an alternative to Magnolia's cupcakes
May I say that their cupcakes were the stalest I've ever tasted
This is truly a place where the goods look better than they actually taste
Don't bother chocking off their cupcakes that taste like cornmeal muffins with icing that taste like wax
I should have baked my own cupcakes
Aside from that, the server was on the phone the whole time he was helping us
Needless to say, I will not be giving this palce another chance
I have had their pizza and their bagels
The pizza didn't really stand out but the bagels were amazing!!! Soft on the inside, no air, and HUGE!!!! I have been looking for my IT bagel place since I moved here 5 months ago and this is IT!!!!
As far as breakfast and lunch goes you wont find a better deal or better food
Service was excellent and friendly
They catered our office Christmas party to perfection
A great place to get a good meal at a good price
Right near Macys and Times Square, the pastries are amazing
I didnt have any food, only a black and white cookie
It was awesome
All the baked goods are either massive, or mini (they make two sizes of everything)
I actually spent an hour looking for this place after I had been there once the day before so I could bring something home with me
Thats how good it is!
this nasty waitress took the money decide how much she's gonna keep for tips
how convenient is that
!! more than 20% tips for lunch
nice
a great bargain and good food
best home fries in the city
One of the best Chinese foods in the city
Can't comment on service, since I've only ordered take-out, but I'm Chinese, so I know good Chinese food
This place is decorated like someone took an office, ripped out the cubicles and purchased a pimp-my-ride home decoration kit
They have stick-on tinted windows, fake palm trees, and black-light accent lights around the ceiling that cause the cheap linen napkins to glow
The food is all right, but way over priced
On top of that, the manager is extremely rude
He tried to tack on extra fees to our bill since the vegetarian member of our dinning party only ordered appetizers (there were no vegetarian entrees)
When questioned on why this was done at the end of the meal rather than informing us when ordering, he accused the vegetarian of lying about her dietary restrictions! Ironic for a kosher place, no? I will not go back
this was my first time at this restaurant

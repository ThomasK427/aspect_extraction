Went here with a big group for bachelorette party and had a wonderful meal
The service was great
I had the veggie Napoleon, which was awesome and filling
Stay away from the Pear martini
it has smoked vodka, so it tastes a bit like beef jerky
Normally, on my birthday everything is planned so the evening is perfect
This year however, we changed the tradition and didn't plan anything, which is risky with a perfectionist like myself
But, my husband and I decided to try Counter
As a birthday perfectionist, I could not have planned it better!  The food was amazing, everything from our 3 Mezze Apps, to our delicious Lentil Terrine (which my husband, a meat eater, was very satieted with), to the complimentary birthday dessert
Nothing was left to chance here
We were not only tended to by an excellent waiter, who though very busy, gave us wonderful service, but also the GM who made sure my birthday dinner was perfect
And when the bill came at the end, I was pleased to see we did not break the bank for my birthday
Thank you Counter! We will be back

Earl Gray-infused vodka martini sounds great, but tastes just alright
The meal that I had (the non-meat meatloaf, the califlour risotto, and some appetizers) was VERY heavy
The server said it was hearty but really it was just heavy
For a vegan restaurant, it's a very non-vegan friendly restaurant, as in you can bring meat-eaters and they would probably be impressed a little bit
But, quickly all would realize that most items on the menu are grease-laden, and the portions are so big that you'd get tired of the flavors before you finish half a plate
I'm vegetarian, my fiance is not, and Counter is by far our favorite restaurant
Whether we're seeking a casual meal and sangria with friends, or a romantic evening with a bottle of organic wine followed up by one of Counter's amazing vegan desserts (the chocolate tart with berry sauce is our favorite), we always leave satisfied and impressed by the service and ambiance
The food is amazing and we're always asking ourselves how can this be vegan? because the flavors are so rich and diverse
The decor is warm and hip with diner-style tables that are casual enough to make everyone feel welcome anytime
The entire staff (from bussers to owners) is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and genuine
Counter is honestly one of my favorite things about trips into NYC
we took our family (including two small children) to counter on a sunday afternoon
my husband and i could not get over the child friendly atmosphere and service but this would also be a place to go with just the two of us later in the evening
the look of this restaurant is cool and hip but unpretentious and the same goes for the wait staff
i can't speak highly enough of the food, presentation and wine list
we are NOT vegans but the food left us satisfied and in disbelief of how delicious it all was
the waiter offered us a perfect wine recommendation for each of our courses and the kitchen whipped up a special soba and peanut sauce dish for the kids
we will most certainly be back soon
I think I have found my new favorite restaurant--Counter! Had dinner there the other night
Cauliflower Risotto was super yummy and really special
It's made with cauliflower, wild mushrooms, and no rice at all
The French Lentil and Wild Rice Terrine (this is what one of my friends got) was also delicious! Wine list seemed extensive and our server knew a lot about what they had
organic and biodynamic wines--the perfect compliment to a great dining experience
I also liked the atmosphere--hip, but not trendy--and the bathroom was nice and clean
Go there and eat and drink
'Counter' is definitely our spot
I'm a huge fan of the homemade sangria the walnut-lentil panini, and he loves the veggie burger
Also, expect wonderfully friendly bartenders who are always ready to recommend an outstanding bottle of wine
Go check it out!!!
Good food, amazing wine, great service
the atmosphere and great food make this a must hit in the east village
I recently had dinner at Counter and my dining experience from beginning to end was unexpectedly fabulous
Not only is the restaurant beautiful and sexy but the food blew me away
I loved their grilled romaine salad and cauliflower risotto with wild mushrooms
I also loved their bathroom, sleek, clean and spacious
I went to Counter last night with a friend and we were pleasantly surprised
I love wine
Their selection of organic wines was impressive and affordable and the food was delicious
I especially enjoyed their cauliflower risotto
My friend had grilled polenta with morels and I haven't had a better polenta anywhere
Everything was pretty much top notch
Vegetarianism with class and style
Its so nice to have a place I can take even my meat eating friends too for a fantastic organic meal with a lot of style and a lot of class
The wine bar really set this place apart from so many other vegetarian restaurants in the city
I had never really thought about organic wines before my Counter experience but now that I have tried them i will certainly be trying more
and with such a huge wine list I have my work cut out for me
I really did have such a great experiance
I ate at Counter with some friends last night and had an amazing dining experience
The food was inventive and so delicious, I didn't miss the dairy or meat (I am not a vegan)
We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share and everything was excellent
Highlights include the vegetable strata and the califlower risotto
AND, don't forget to order dessert - Go for the chocolate torte and the ice-cream sundae! Plus it has a great atmosphere, pleasant service and very good wine
I can't wait to go back!!!
What a fantastic place to dine
The food, the atmosphere, the service--all perfection
The wine list is unbelievable
You've got to try this place!!
went with a friend last night
he's a vegetarian, im not (though i do LOVE my share of yummy veggies, tofu, tempeh, et all) both of us were not impressed
the atmosphere was made cooler only by its dim lighting
otherwise nothing adorns the walls, albeit what looks like a dirty fish tank in the back
not really romantic as its a rather sparse space
we both ordered apps and entrees
presentation was nice and descriptions on the menu were certainly intriguing but otherwise nothing had any flavor
reall, really bland
overall, my opinion is that its faaar better than angelica's kitchen but at the prices they charge for what it is they are really serving, you're better off with a bowl of brown rice
As I am a nonvegetarian, I found that counter is a little tastier than most vegetarian resteraunts but of course you will be paying up the wazoo for it
Biggest problem was : The service at the bar was awful and tacky
We ordered a bottle of wine ,$60 while we were waiting for the rest of our party
The bartender made us pay immediately and looked on at us assumingly
Kinda rude
Once seated the table service was better
I wouldn't return back to the place unless I had rich vegatarian relative in town picking up the bill and fortunately for me I don't
this place is amazing
even if you don't like vegetarian food you must try it out
if god and allah went to dinner they would choose this place
Counter has the best food of any restaurant in this very competitive neighborhood
The food is fresh, imaginative, and tasty
On top of all that, it is vegan--so it's healthful to boot! The organic wine bar is fun and you may even learn something about wine from the knowledgeable staff
Check it out
Brunch is super yummy, too
Ginger crepes!
I thoroughly enjoyed my recent visit to Counter

unfortunately i wasnt hungry because i just came from dinner but i ordered an appetizer just to try the food
i had the pork shumai (fried) and some sashimi and it was delicious
great great great great place
its hard to find great sushi without paying big bucks, but they had great fresh sushi at reasonable prices
Had twist combo dinner
proportions big and tasted great
would have kept it my little secret, but the service was so great want to see it do great
try the twist martini
I went to Sushi Twist to celebrate my birthday
Our waitress was very attentive and the sushi was very fresh and delicious
They had a lot of special rolls which was hard to chose from
The atmosphere was very warm
The food was delicious and at the end of our meal, the staff surprised me with an array of ice cream w/fried bananas and they sang happy birthday to me which I thought was very sweet of them
I'm definitely going back
madison ave desperately needed a place like this
unassuming, unpretentious place with great food at a decent price
it's not dirt cheap but the quality makes the price worth it
the vegetable dumpling soup is perfect for when it's cold out
and try the rolls, they're huge and lots of fun
nice people too!
I forgot about all other sushi places after I found this place
The sushi was twice as good as Bond Street at half the price
my boyfriend took me there for our one year anniversary, had a great time
not only was the food delicious, but the whole atmosphere was romantic
it was quiet enough for us to enjoy a nice meal
service was great
what a great place
the food was great
fresh fish, fun rolls, great meat dishes
absolutely wonderful
i really walked out of the place 100% satisfied  if you want something that's not on the menu, just ask for it and they'll most likely be able to whip it up for you
this place has a real family-feel to it
and try the scallion pancakes to start
yummm
love sushi, and eat it often, but this place has rolls that i've never tasted before
tastes great and reasonably priced
great white wine (pinot grigio) with my meal made everything perfect
recommended
The food was great
There are many, many rolls and entrees to choose from
I had the Tokyo Triangle that has salmon, tuna, yellow tail in 1 roll and Twist Combo that has kalbi, tempura, chicken, fish, seafood, and vegatables-- I highly recommend it
If I had a bigger stomach, I would've ordered more
And, we all know food itself doesn't bring back customers
Service was awesome to say the least
I am not good with using chopsticks and asked for a fork, instead the owner insisted that I try using a chopstick an made me an easy-to-use chop stick right there on the spot! All the people who were there seemed to be regulars at this newly opened restaurant
I will go back again and again and again and again and again
Outstanding food and service
Some of the best sushi i had in town
Dinner was 87 for 2 people
Walking home for work, I stopped in for a happy hour special, but stayed and enjoyed a whole meal
My favorite was the Kalbi Dinner! The meat was juicy, and went great with sake!! My co-worker tried the Volcano Roll
It came out hot, never had we tasted a toasted roll! highly recommended for dates and business meals alike! The service was great as well, they were friendly and attentive
Will definately go again
my husband and i absolutely loved the place
we had the salmon donburi it was sooo delicious along with some super fresh sashimi and some rolls
i can't remember the name of my roll but there were probably around 40 to choose from and they are sooo good
my husband ordered the pizza roll, which is served warm
it was such a creative item, i've really never had anything like it
to top it off, the server was very friendly and eager to answer all our questions
highly recommended for all sushi lovers!
i walked by the place looking for a quick bite to eat with my bf and i was SO impressed by the quality of food and service
so many special rolls to choose from
i had the explosion roll and it was probably the best roll i've ever had
there was spicy tuna, eel, shrimp tempura, advocado and caviar
it really doesnt get much better than that
and for fellow meat lovers,the kalbi is to die for
the smell of it alone made me salivate, it's a MUST-TRY
it really was an amazing, amazing meal
and the servers were really attentive, and the owner even came over to us a couple of times to make sure everything was ok
overall, GREAT PLACE, i will DEFINITELY go back
The food here was great
I definitely recommend it, and for the value, I will continue going here for sushi
If you live in the area definitely try this place out
I really had a great experience at this place
The food is reasonably priced and GREAT
I highly recommend any type of specialty rolls and salmon donburi
In addition, atmosphere is great and the staff is really friendly
Good place to go eat with friends or dates
Try it out~
After becoming numbed to the cookie cutter sushi restaurants all over the city, I was completely blown away by Wasabi Lobby
Two of us went there on Friday night, and were greeted with a very friendly staff and a very clean and inviting space
The menu was filled with of course the standard sushi fair, but the real gem was the unuusal and creative combinations of sushis and sauces and other ingredients they had as well
The waiters and staff helped me pick out a number of rolls and pieces, and every one was better then the next
I couldn't tell you al the stuff we had, but it left me wanting for more
One with cream cheese and aberry sauce was particularly tasty
Each time I have been back I have receieved the same friendly service and outstanding unique dishes
I highly recommend it
This newly renovated eatery has beautiful food- they take care to display each dish so it is appetizing and pretty to look at
The Panko Crusted Tuna Roll is my favorite- but don't take my word for it- go sit in this gorgeous place and see for yourself
The owner is a gentleman and he always greets us with a smile, and remembers us each time we come in! They have great lunch specials (in fact local kids from the school next door eat lunch there) and you get great dinner service without the ridiculous prices!
This refreshing, original, and completely irresistable restaurant has quickly become my favorite lobby in the city
In fact, my girlfriend Jess, who is Japanese, tells me it tastes even more authentic than the food her ancestors cook in Tokyo! As a native New Yorker, I can't vouch for that, but I can promise you that there is nothing like it on this earth!
Wasabi Lobby may be favorite neighborhood restaurant
The rolls are delicious, unique, and creatively named! Going to the Lobby is an experience that you want to have over and over again
From the friendly staff to the serene atmosphere, it is always a fine Japanese meal--one that my ancestors would be proud of!
What a wonderful restaurant! A great atmosphere with the nicest staff in NYC, Wasabi Lobby has an array of delicious dishes and sushi
I went on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend and they brought out heart-shaped sushi
The staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and you feel like you are at a prestigious 5-star restaurant without paying 5-star prices or dealing with 5-star attitudes from waiters
You won't be disappointed!
wonderful sushi

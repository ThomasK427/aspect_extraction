Lots of suits and a so so decor
However, the food and service made up for it
We were a party of 7 and we had prompt curteous service
Definately try the chocolate cake
Not impressed
I wouldn't go back for their food
The portions were adequate and pretty, though I didn't feel it was anything worth going back for
Check was pretty steep
My friends and I split the check
I didn't care for the scene? The atmosphere was somewhere in Maine, although I had never been there before
I wasn't sure who was our waiter/waitress
There was a table with two children screaming, that didn't help our dining experience
The wine list, I've seen before
I guess I just won't go back, nothing really stood out for us to make an effort to visit again
ate here for the 1st time, already excited for a return
service was considerate and friendly, really helpful with suggestions (i'm picky), and attentive
the food was fantastic (great balance btwn fish and meat dishes) and not fussy
so nice to see a busy restaurant that lives up to hype!
Checked out the Harrison during Tribecca Film Festival restaurant week and immediately went of the Prix Fixe menu for some tastier choices (truffle oil risotto and pan seared chicken w/various herbs was as succulent/savory a bird I've ever had)
Arrived late, but calling ahead worked, and they REALLY held a table for 2 of us! A plus in my book
add constantly refilled glasses, folded napkins (when you left your seat), courteous service and a wine list to match
Yeah!
Without reservations we were seated immediately, this was only the start of the excellent service provided by the Harrison
The waiter, who reminded me of a cute double for Scrub guy Zach Braff, couldnt have been better
The menu consisted of interesting flavors and combinations, which were then clearly demonstrated in the presentation and taste
I went for the bass, which was served with asparagus, watermelon radishes and yellow tomatoes
It is one of the best dishes I have had this year
The chef was even kind enough to offer us further insight into what went into this creation
My boyfriend went for the lamb which was served with a lentil / couscous combination, a bit odd served together, and the only setback of the dish
This is clearly the better of the two (Red Cat), and well be back soon again
Terrific wines, great service
Hard to go wrong here
Not pretentious
From the minute we entered this restaurant the staff was exemplary
Seated on time and greeted so warmly by all! Assisted with the wine list, served extraordinary food
Given ample time between courses
Each appetizer was a success: lobster bisque, fried clams, scallops
Each entree a winner:seared tuna, lamb shank (fell off the bone tender), shell steak yum! and tender and halibut so good
The desserts were UNBELIEVEABLE! Chocolate mousse, apple pie (crepe) what winners
We've eaten at The Harrison many times, and have always had a great experience! The staff is amazingly nice, helpful and accomodating; the food is fantastic, the atmosphere/decor is gorgeous - over all it's just a wondeful restaurant
the door, the bartender, the waiter, the coat check girl
where are the grizzled new yorkers? friendly, attentive, professional - and the food!! wonderfully rich, homey and sophisticated (scallops AND sweetbreads, with a pomegranate sauce, yum) food that flat out tastes good (try the ravioli appetizer, steak, char - i have a feeling it's all good)
the atmosphere is happening, but our server seemed to genuinely care
thanks
This is a great place for a romantic date with someone special
We were seated promptly, given great service by our waitress a wonderful meal
Yes, it was expensive but its worth treating yourself to a place like this
If you are looking for a nice date place - I would say bring your special other here you won't be disappointed
My boyfriend and I dine out very frequently at nice restaurants in the City, and I probably took it for granted until having an experience like we did at the Harrison
We were seated promptly, but that was about the only plus
We ordered a bottle of wine, which they did not present to us, brought to the table already opened, and did not pour a taste before filling our glasses
My entree was room temperature at best, even after waiting about 1/2 hour between the appetizer and main course
Service was ABYSMALLY slow, and after our waitress was NOWHERE to be found, we spotted her sitting and talking with a group of friends
On two occassions we had to flag people down to ask for service
After noting our unpleasant experience, dessert was on the house -- but by that time it was too late!!
stopped by the harrison for a late evening dinner
the restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated giving off a warm and inviting feeling
the quality of food was excellent
i highly recommend the diver scallops and sweet bread to start
however, what was lacking was the service
they screwed up our drink order (we ordered a bottle of wine and they brought out 2 glasses instead)
the entres took 45 minutes to come out even though the place was empty
finally, we had to ask several times for our dishes to be cleared so we could order desert
after waiting 15 minutes for desert menus i finally had to go to the maitre'd and ask for menus
again
unfortunately the poor service ruined what would have been an enjoyable evening of food and drink
Harrison is my favorite restauant in 2002
It's a beautifully-designed space: comfortable, well-lit and you can actually hear your companions talk during the meal
The menu is interesting, the food is delicious, and a good value for the money
I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary and it was extremely romantic
The restaurant is designed beautifully with dark wood and white walls
The service and the quality of the food was top notch
I highly recommend it
I just love to go downtown for dinner and The Harrison has become an instant favorite
Start by enjoying the atmosphere while having a glass of wine at the bar and we you are ready, go and enjoy your food! but don't forget to make reservations
I enjoyed my meal at The Harrison
The service was a little slow, but it wasn't horrible
The atmosphere is lovely, but the clientele are very casual
I saw more khaki pants than should be humanly allowed
It was a great mid-week dinner spot and my meat was cooked beautifully
Although a relatively new restaurant, The Harrison is off to a great start
The atmosphere is very cool and comfortable and the food is terrific
My wife and I had dinner here after catching an early movie and absolutely loved it
We'll definitely come back for more
This restaurant had come highly recommended and we decided to try it
The food was great, lot's of fish on the menu, but the service was virtually non-existent
I think our waiter must have been pre-occupied with something other than his job
I would not go back to the Harrison as there are too many other restaurants in NYC that can provide great food and great service
had a date here last night, and wow
that's all i can say
a perfect fall restaurant
warm and glowy and full of good vibes, great service, and unbelievable food
try the cavatelli and bacon appetizer
monk fish and minestrone entree and the bananna almond tart for dessert
i will definitly be back
mouthwateringly perfect
I recommend The Harrison to anyone who can appreciate a very well put together meal - it is gourmet in its proportions and prescence as well as in its taste
The only complaint was from my dinner partner who claimed he was too hungry to eat at a place like this because he felt he could have eaten 3 entrees - i was perfectly full which is the point of a gourmet meal
Also there was a German white wine that was the best white ive had in a long time - it wasnt insanely expensive and started with a g - just a suggestion
The decor is a little plain and the seating is a touch too close but its worth it for the food

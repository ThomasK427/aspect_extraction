Their staff was friendly and very well trained
We were told to have a drink at the bar before being sat as our table was beiing set
The bartender was
gorgeous and recommend us the monte carlo cocktail that was amazing
We then sat and share the crab cakes appetizers and had the veal milanese and the salmon as man courses
that were fantastic
Desserts were exceptional as our waiter suggested us the chocolate souffle and the crepes with nutella
The atmosphere was so fun that we decided to have another cocktail at the bar and enjoy the scene
We reserved their private party room last week-end and it was fantastic from start to finish
The service was excellent as well as the food
In addition their private room is beautiful with lot of natural lights
Finally their prices are really reasonable with no hidden charge
I have followed your recommendation and it's definetely the best spot for brunch in new york
The service is quick and efficient, the food great and the atmosphere perfect for brunch
I had the eggs benedict and my wife the croque madame that were superb
The food was excellent and their selection of cocktails is one of the best in NYC
try the Blue or Pink Bunny (aphrodisiac cocktails - blue for the boys and pink for the girls) if you're feeling adventurous
Plus, the hottest staff I've seen in a long time
Get there early if you want a seat
the place gets packed!
Secured Valentine's Day reservation and were seated promptly
The place was cute and filled up quickly
The $45 V-day prix fixe menu was a great bargain for three courses and special shot at the end of the meal
The food was tasty and service was good
The only downside, the coat check had a hidden $2 charge (no sign, no mention)
The attendant actually tapped my bf and mentioned the fee as we were about to leave
A discreet sign by check-in could save others embarrassment
Was visiting the city last week end when a friend wanted to show us some cool nyc scenes
Went to Tao
beautiful space but terrible crowd, serafina
decent pizza but terrible service (they tried to charge us for drinks we didnt have, they did not apologize for it)
balthazar, great food and great atmosphere and 212, for us the best place of all
212 had the coolest drinks and a large menu with over 50 items
The atmosphere was great with great music as well as the best looking staff i have seen ever in a restaurant
Our bill was less than Serafina and we did not have to deal with clueless and dishonest Serafina waiters
I followed your recommendations and visit 212 for brunch
I ordered the eggs benedict, my wife a burger (one o the best i had in a long time) and the kids ordered french toast and belgium waffles
The service was very professional and friendly and the pricing was really fare
The restaurant was very busy and the ambiance enjoyable
We will go back as it is one of the best restaurant in new york city
i believe this place has it right
they got the best looking female staff in town (wonder how they do it) conmfort food at a decent price (for Mahattan at least), great drinks and great ambiance and on top they are friendly
i was adviced to go to 212 by a friend and was not disappointed
lot of hotties
also great food
excellent all the way even so you might wait to be seated
good food, great drinks and friendly service
Normally I will not bother making comments of restaurant but 212 did such a great job for my birthday party that I can stop advertising this restaurant
From start to finish everything seemed easy
No complications, no hidden cost
Just great food, excellent service and a great set-up in the private room
We definetely recommend 212 to anyone
definitely a great restaurant and probably in the top 10 in NYC
drinks, food, atmosphere, service all at a good value is rare in this town and you might wait for a table on the week-end but it's worth it
they have also the best drinks and the best looking bar staff
I went to 212 on the recommendation of other reviews on this site
My reservation was forgotten about, and I was forced to stay at the bar for 30 mins before a table became available
I was not allowed to transfer my credit card to the table, and was treated disgracefully while the hostess waited for the bar to sign off my card
The table was draughty
There was a set menu which I was not informed of when booking, and we were forced to pay full-price even though we declined the seafood appetizer
My waterglass remained empty for most of the meal
I emailed management to inform them of this and requested an explanation but never received a reply
Even by McDonald's standards this is a disaster
Good brunch especially if you have kids
They have a lot of omelettes and baby food
Though the food was pretty good as well as the service
Friendly spot
Very recommendable for anyone
Never been for dinner but I heard it was extremely packed
A beautiful restaurant where you can eat and dance the night away with the Manhattan's cream of the crop
Beautiful women, beautiful bartenders dancing on top of the bar to loud music with big beats, delicious vodka, and gourmet meals at good price make this 212 call worth the long distance charges any time!
We went to 212 last Friday and the place was packed
We waited for 20 minutes at the bar, tried their cocktails (watermelon martini
wow) and got into the vibe
For dinner I had their lobster risotto (phenomenal)
I was surprised by the wine list that was very well done(Petrus!)
wise up your comments citysearch
Good job
We had a private party at 212 and it was fabulous all the way
If you consider using those guys don't hesitate they are great
The food was fantastic, the service was better than at Daniel and the bill extremely reasonable
pretty rare in NYC
Best regards
Michelle
the staff was friendly and attentive but the food was just OK
go for the bar scence and good watermelon martinis
The Scene This neighborhood spot feels instantly alive, with a semi-open kitchen sending warmth into the bustling front room, tightly packed wooden tables and striped wall banquettes
Despite the servers' best intentions, it's easy to feel rushed while perusing the menu -- an awkwardly large blackboard
The Food The French fare gets more serious attention than at many casual bistros
A starter of poached pear with creamy gorgonzola awakens the taste buds, and fans of chef Neil Ganic know not to miss the meaty crab cakes, served with a tangy aioli
The restaurant's namesake fish stew is a saffron-flavored dish that lets the flavors of lobster, mussles, shrimp, scallop and cod dominate, but leaves one craving more spice
The sensationally tender filet melts in the mouth, and the rotating vegetable sides--leeks in particular--add to the appeal
Decadent chocolate souffl ends the meal on a satisfying sweet note
The food was decent, but the service was TERRIBLE
The waiter forgot the wine he recommended, then over charged for it on the bill
Poor service might be okay in France, but not here
loved this place from when it was on atlantic avenue, but this one is even better! the comfortable atmosphere and the unpretenious, hospitable staff makes this place stand out from all of the french places popping up all over town
seafood lover's paradise with fresh fish, there are many alternatives like the filet mignon (delicious) and lamb (incredible) for my veggie friends it's slim pickings, but the vegetable appetizers are enough to make as entrees
i keep coming back to this place because the food is great, but the friendly and accomodating staff (and kookie chef who greets you as you arrive) and comfy atmostphere (including a dimly lit garden - great for dates, not the best for eating bouillabaisse) are what makes this place a 'regluar' joint
guaranteed good wine (with a quaint story about the winemaker from the owners) and an incredible meal that makes you feel at home

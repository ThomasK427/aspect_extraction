Easily the most creative and enjoyable sushi I've had, but by far the most expensive
My girlfriend and I shared the $100 (each) Omikase (chef's choice) menu
It was unbelievable
6 or 7 courses of the best fish I've ever had, each of which flawlessly presented and explained by the very friendly and attentive staff
With 2 Kirin's, we were pushing $300 for dinner
Incredible meal, but an equally incredible cost
It is definitely not worth the money
It is impossible to get through on the phone, it is always busy
The sushi was sub-par
I have had better
Even their signature cod fish wasn't all that great
Son't waste your time and go to Sushi of Gari instead!
Not the sushi experience I had hoped for, the waiter we had was rude and almost incomprehensible
The food was poor, both ths ignature black cod and bento box dessert were sub-par; the shrimp tempura was downright inedible
The only good thing was the o-toro sushi, but at $12 a piece, even that was not worth it
For my first trip to Nobu I deceided to try the chefs tasting
The tastings range from $50 dollars a meal and up
I got the $100 tasting
The waiter asked what I did and did not like, and I was very satisfied with what I got
All 6 courses were excelent, and the desert was superb
A dark chocolate souffl with green tea ice cream
My only complaint was that I was still a bit hungry after the meal
Overall I would definatly recomend this restraunt to any one who liked Japanese food, and had a little extra money to spend
I highly recommend going to Nobu for a special occasion
It's a bit pricy for everyday dining, not to mention the difficulty in getting a reservation
Make sure you reserve approximately two months in advance, this is a HOT restaurant
The food was delicious and on the cutting edge
When you go, you should ask for help from the wait staff in deciding what to order since the menu can be daunting
The server we had was so friendly and helpful which made the dining experience even better
The atmosphere is just like any other expensive restaurant
Also, you might be able to do some celebrity watching if you're lucky!
My wife brought me to Nobu last night for my birthday and I was immediately enamored with the place
The staff was entirely friendly, from the front door to the waitstaff
The food was creative and every dish lived up to my expectations
As described by many others, the black cod w/ miso was heavenly
The yellowtail with jalapeno was fantastic
I've been to Nobu upwards of 20 times, and I am shocked by the negative reviews it has gotten
It is the best japanese restaurant I have ever been to, and I've been to many as sushi is my favorite food
For all you people who gave it bad reviews, either you ordered wrong, went with too many people, or simply took stupid, irrelevant things into account like how the coat check lady treated you
The food is a bit pricey, but for its quality it is well worth it
As a die-hard fan of Nobu's two sister restaurants in London, expectations were running high on the night that we finally managed to get a reservation in New York
Initial impressions were
disappointing is the wrong word, but it certainly lacks the class and sense of occasion that it's sophisticated siblings offer
The decor is a tad more kitsch, but it's the overly casual clientelle that lets the side down - one middle-aged diner in shorts and white socks springs to mind
Fortunately though, the food is as superb as ever; the sashimi salad was wonderfully fresh, whilst the black cod was a knock-out as usual
Best of all was the price which was much lower than anticipated - the perfect end to a great meal
I have been calling for a few weeks to make reservaton
It is either busy or a recording that you can't leave a voicemail
It is so annoying
It is so rude
If there is no reservation available
then at least let peope know, there is so many good restaurant around
Nobu acts like it is a King
If there is no one to answer the phone, I doubt the service is going to be superior
the supermarket of the sushis
crowded, next in line, without a smile
I was not at all thrilled with the food
Of course there is a certain aura to the place, but that aside, the food is mediocre
It's mediocrity would most likely be due to the hype, anything less than perfect would have been a let down, and it certainly was
Rock Shrimp were amazing, kobe beef both sizzling and and tartar were average
Chiken Teryaki was good
Service was not great at all
Decor was not quite what one would expect from a hollywood east hot spot
I would give it another try
I did go with a pary of 14, so that could have thrown things off a bit
It was perhaps the best meal I had ever had
The blackened codfish and sashimi tuna salad were to die for! We got a table right away on a Friday night without a reservation! The atmosphere would have been almost perfect if it werent for the fact that we were seat right naext to the noisy kitchen but I guess the speedy service comes with a price
The best part was though that it was my date's as well as my first time there so our server explained the menu for us and helped us decide and it semmed as though every thing was an excellent choice
Simply put
my number one choice for special occasion dining
Don't come for the sushi
come for what I like to call the Japanese tapas
The miso cod should, by default, be part of your meal
but the squid pasta and creamy spicy crab stand out more
Service is mixed
I've had outstanding service and mediocre service there
The decor is definitely dated, but you'll be too busy spotting celebs to notice
I'd say there's more than a 50% chance of seeing a celeb on any given night
Place the obligatory order of a little sushi at the end of the meal (for dessert)
just b/c you kind of have to
My favorite restaurant in the city
which is a bold statement
It was fabulous! We ordered seven courses and enjoyed each one separately
Get three cold, two hot
The tuna with greens and wasabi dressing is great
The lobster with asparagus and porcini mushrooms is seriously the best thing I have ever eaten
The char was amazing too
Make sure you get dessert
look for a banana roll with this chocolate dipping sauce
I am drooling right now! Quite expensive, but suck it up, you can't live/visit NYC and not eat here
We had great service, great food, Sashimi Salad, Toro Tartar, New Sashimi, Rock Shrimp, Sea Urchin Tempura, Miso Cod, each got assorted sashimi sushi
We were in heaven! We ended the dinner with divine desserts, fruit sorbet, mochi ice cream
This made our Friday night
No doubt
Nobu definitely serves some of the best stuff in the industry, but you can sense that Nobu has become another global moneymaking machine with lack of personality and style
Service is functional, often slow and incompetent
Lunch dishes are great and reasonably priced
Save the money for a groovier hangout at the Bond St
Lounge where food quality is similar and more creative/improvised
I have been to Nobu 4 times and each time I felt as if the restaurant has deteriorated in all aspects

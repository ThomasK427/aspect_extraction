(nobody wants to have your people to wait unnecessary at holiday dinner)
Since we had appetiziers, we could not finish the entrees and asked the waiter to wrap the leftover
The saver did not come back with the food but just with the bill
I called up the restaurant next week, and explained the situation to the manager, who was offering do something nice for your next visit
I suggestted the manager to get back to me with what exactly they can do to make this up after her talking to the management, but no return calls yet
Worst exprience
The service, food, and wine list as well as the knowledge possessed by the staff has been amazing each and every time I've dined at BLT Steak or just popped in for drinks
As for those who would say it's too expensive - it's NYC
Midtown
Good food and a discerning crowd cost money
The portions and quality are well worth it
In my opinion, the bar is not very well laid out, its narrow design makes it hard to meet a group for drinks
In addition, Their Sommelier team is one of the top in the City
The famous popovers tasted like they were from the previous day and had been reheated in a microwave
in a word, tasteless and gummy
The filet of sole was $45
00 a la carte and the sauce accompanying it tasted like the salt lake city flats
The side dishes we sampled: mushrooms, parmesan gnocchi and creamed spinach were no better or worse than those I've had for half the price
The food was lukewarm
The waiter not to be found for the most part
My advice -- don't waste your money here
This is a terrific place
The food is wonderful, and the menu is so varied and interesting
The room is chic, modern but comfortable
The waitstaff is a little stiff, but not at all unpleasant
The kobe beef steak sandwich at lunch is incredible
The portions are huge
be forewarned, go on an empty stomach! I had an amazing dessert here
a crepe souffle thing
I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it is worth picking your waiter's brain over
sooo good!
We didn't show up until almost 11:30 without a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated promptly
Our server was excellent and quick, since we told her how hungry we were
The appetizers and dinner were fantastic
We all tried a variety of meats and sauces with sides and enjoyed just about every one of them
A great place to go for a steak or bbq meal!
The food was great, although the prices are abit high for such a casual place
Jeans and a button up would do fine
The popovers that they serve for free are to die for! and the complimentary bread and spread are delicious! The restaurant is on the noisey side and but so far it is the best steakhouse I've been in NYC! And I've been to alot
Go here for a casual dinner but great steak
My waitress was sweet and helpful in selecting wine for my taste and didn't balk when my dining partner declined to drink alcohol
Lots of yummy freebies
Steak was cooked correctly and nicely seasoned
Lots of money dines here
I went this past Saturday night and thought it was great
There were 3 of us in our party and I tried everyone's meals
The braised short ribs were excellent - so rich and tasteful and too much for one person
The new york strip was a large cut as well and seasoned nicely
The special - red snapper was a good sized piece served with vegetables and was really good
A steak place can have great seafood too
We each orded one side dish which were all excellent - I would recommend the carrots or the parmesan potatoes
I thought the portions were enough and their wine menu is extensive
I thought it was an overall very nice meal
The service was not top notch but everyone was very friendly and helpful
We had a drink at the bar first
It was basically vodka and bottled Pom beverage (which you can buy in bodegas next to snapple)
We sat, did our ordering and were given these overwhelmingly large and gooey chessey popovers
delicious but about five times too big(maybe trying to overcompensate for what was to come
) Our food was good but I felt it was uninspired and a bit lazy
I can find lemon caper butter sauce anywhere! It ended up being abou 110 per person with only one bottle of medium priced wine, regular apps and entrees and one dessert
I felt ripped off
I also felt like it was a blatant ripoff of Craft
Maybe if the LT in BLT weren't so busy making rounds and shaking hands in the dining room all night and stayed in the kitchen a little longer, he could concentrate on his own menu
I attended the soft opening of BLT Steak last night and I'm still pinching myself
It was simply incredible
The wine, the food and atmosphere where all remarkable
Most notable was the Tuna Tartare, Foie Gras BLT, Rib Eye for two (one of the few steaks I've had in a while that was done as I had requested: medium rare
why is it that so few NYC restaurants, aside from a notable few, can prepare a steak correctly?)
The sides were a heavenly compliment to the meats
Mashed potatoes, braised carrots and creamed spinach were rich, flavorful and delicious
Oh, and do yourself a favor: save room for dessert when you go
BLT Steak opens to the public on March 9th and I urge you all to go and enjoy the latest addition to New York's short list of finest restaurants
Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down
We had the most wonderful waitress
All the items she recommended were phenomenal, even the exotic sounding dishes lik the crabmeat avocado dumplings (heaven) and cilantro soup (much better than it sounds)
For some reason the place was empty at peak lunch hour
don't understand why, the service was great, great priced, delicious food quiet
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by
Ssearching for a restaurant in midtown that was kid friendly, wife came in w/ a 4yr old and 9 mth old and her parents, and came upon this
What a mistake
We arrived @ 1:45 and sat down @ 2:00 not too bad
@ 2:00 they were out of fries, imagine a 4yr old not getting fries, we were served with a mixed green salad after we gave our vegetable order as a sub
asked for italian dressing received ceaser w/ anchovies, asked for xtra napkins, forks and peper never got them
moral stay away
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible
still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer
Great deal! I saw a handwritten sign and went in to kill some time, $5 wines, $3 beers?!? Are you kidding me? The space was gorgeous, the bartender was
sigh! And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world! We had to ask the bartender to stop refilling the bowl because we couldn't help ourselves
they were that good
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday
The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic
I thought that she has been working there only cuz of her look to get some guys in the suit, but she is propably the friendliest female bartender in NYC
and that Asian girl
Go girls!!! She got us the apple pie!! which is soo brilliant
and hey the prices???? nothing for the midtown and Rock Plaza
we spent 50 $$ definetly will come back with my friends!!!
This place has $6 martinis all night long evey wednesday and they are all yummy
My girlfriends and I go almost every week

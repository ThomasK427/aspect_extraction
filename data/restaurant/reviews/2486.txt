Yes, I grew up in California (both Northern and Southern) and then lived in Texas for a few years


I feel pretty qualified to recommend a Mexican restaurant
In the three years I've lived here I've not found a restaurant that I've frequented quite as often as La Cocina
I absolutely LOVE their chicken tamales
I will say the salsa lacks kick, but I'm not a big chips and salsa person anyways
I've never had a hard time getting a table and have never had a problem with the service
The 2 for 1 margaritas are a good value and quite yummy!
We went to a E30th Street location
Very disappointed! Food did not taste like Mexican AT ALL! I picked chicken burrito and enchilada
It tasted awful
The substitute was supposed to be a grilled chicken quesadilla
In fact, it was anything BUT GRILLED CHICKEN! After my 2nd complaint I finally got the desired dish (miniportion was free, as the waitress put it)
The bad food was still charged to my tab
No apology was offered
I paid for a full portion of bad food and got in exchange a half-portion of okey food for free
That was my last visit there! I love Mexican food, when it's fresh, good and tasty
This is not the case here, sorry to say that
Having just moved from Dallas, I can assure you, this is not Mexican
The food is below average, the guacamole is not good, the salsa is edible
The service was below average
border line rude
Watch out the for 2 for 1 Margaritas
It is PER PERSON
When we complained, the mamanger removed the charge and then argued with us about it
He then promptly stated the he could add the charge back on to our bill, if we continued to discuss
Obviously, this place is a joke!
Being from Texas, we are always on the lookout for decent Mexican food
La Cocina was a great find
Their downstairs dining area is well decorated, they can accomodate large parties and there is a great guitar player to make you feel like your back home
We went there on a Saturday night, they had a 2 for 1 margarita deal
The chips and salsa were fantastic, it was authentic pico de gallo
Everyone was satisfied with their meals and my hard to please boyfriend was able to order his taco salad to his specifications w/o a problem
Highly recommend this place if you're looking for great Tex-Mex!!!
During the weekends this place is a must go for brunch
The best eggs you will ever have and so much food, you will never eat it
The price is great!
I went here the other night with another friend, I ordered the taco salad and he had a burrito
I could not even touch my salad it smelled so awful
The chicken was brown
stringy and smelled and there wasn't even real lettuce or tomatoes in the salad
The buritto looked like it had been microwaved
Even though we didn't touch a thing on our plates, the waitress couldn't be bothered asking what was wrong, but rather chose to leave the plates sitting there
I wouldn't go here again if I was starving and they were giving the food away for free!!
I called for a reservation but the are now pair of 8's they have closed!! They said that Les Routiers closed last july
The food was very good; however it does not even come close to making up for the terrible service we received that night
Not only did the food take an eternity to come out; but the waiter never checked in, explained the delay for the food, or refreshed our drinks
It seems Les Routiers' service really falls apart when they get busy
I had a very pleasant dinner with my family
The wine selection was good
I enjoyed as an appetizer the mussels in white wine and garlic, while my Mother enjoyed the coutry pate
I opted for the special of bouef bourignon and it was wonderful
The music wasn't quite right, but not loud enough to disrupt conversation
Overall, I'd say we all enjoyed ourselves
I dined here with a group of friends a few months ago, and all of us were pleasantly surprised by the experience
The service was a bit spotty, but it was a busy night
The food was excellent across the board, from the mussels in a light cream sauce to the rabbit and duck
Side dishes and bread were also good
Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food
I would come back!
French food, good value, good atmosphere
It has the right taste and right atmosphere for a restaurant presenting French food
It's not quite Paris, but it'll certainly remind you why you like Paris
They do close early -- on a Saturday night they would not seat us at 10:30
I go here like almost every day
It's a little cramped, but if you like small cute diners, then this is for you! :)
This place feels like home
Great homemade muffins (corn, bran, blueberry) are made even better by toating them with butter
Homemade danish also a winer
Breakfast plates are huge and the eggs taste fresh
Fresh squeezed OJ is a nice touch
Service is fast and friendly
Your coffee cup will always be full
Prices are very reasonable
Go hungry, the portions are quite large
I love this restaurant
The food is great
I always go there once a week the times I missed is only when I'm away on vacation
I recommend the seafood hot sour soup, chicken pan friend noodles, grilled steak cubes (Bulacloc), Seafood Bouillabaise, Fried Vegetable Spring Roll (#2), Sweet Sour Fish, Fried Calamari, Ribs, Stringbeans
Its always packed so you have to wait for a table
Other than the wait, everything else is great
I don't understand some of the reviewers on here
If you want a high quality dining experience go somewhere where the prices reflect as such! I just paid $42 dollars for a meal for two, including tip, which covered: two appetizers, two enormous entrees, one bowl of soup, complementary tea, one alcoholic beverage and one non-alcoholic beverage
Neither of us could finish the amount of food presented to us
We had about a ten minute wait but the service once seated is efficient and friendly (this was on a Friday night)
There is no rush to finish your meal
If you want a cheap, tasty asian experience with a highly diverse crowd of NY'ers, check this place out
If you want to be a snobbish food critic, take out your wallet and put your money where your mouth is
My roommate and I had been loyal Saigon customers since our move to NYC in 2005
While we think the food is great, the delivery service is terrible
I don't mean the wait, the delivery person always gets to our apartment in less than 30 minutes, HOWEVER if you dare to tip him less than $5 for delivery he will not give you your change, will question if your asking price is correct, and will mumble what are no doubt swear words under his breath
This happened to us not once, not twice, but three times
Sorry buddy, three strikes youre out
Will never order delivery from here again
I loved the first few times I've been here (last year) when it was still relatively new and introducing some of the best Vietnamese for reasonable prices
What made them go from that to a restaurant that features Thai, Chinese, Japanese (even sushi!), and limited Vietnamese is beyond me
The service has gone down hill, the food is lackluster, and the decor has changed a bit to accomodate the huge crowds of people that wait for food
It is disappointing to see (and taste) the change in everything with them
Saigon Grill is as authentic Vietnamese food as the Panda Wok at your strip mall is authentic Chinese food

The corn chowder was rich and flavorful, perfect for a winter night
The rack of lamb special was amazing, and my friend's salmon also delicious
I wasn't sure what to expect from the spicy chocolate truffles for dessert, but am glad I tried them
They were wonderful and like nothing I've had before
Can't wait to go back for brunch
Very disappointed after hearing such great things
2 of us came in at 8 pm, ordered 2 appetizers 2 entrees
The waitress interrupted us halfway through our meal to say that if we wanted dessert we had to order it then, because the kitchen wanted to close
Not even 9 o'clock
while the hangar steak was good, the sweet potato fries that were supposed to come with it were undercooked, greasy, and completely limp
totally inedible
the roasted salmon was VERY overcooked, but the bok choy was lovely
the eel tempura appetizer was very good, and the bouillabaise desperately needed seasoning
It is a shame
Perhaps it was an off night, but i will not be returning
To have the kitchen staff standing around rolling their eyes and sighing at you while you're trying to finish your meal (at 9 PM!) is NOT a pleasant dining experience
The food was amazing
the only drawback of this place is its tiny size
Make a reservation! The ambience is nice, but it was a touch hot with the kitchen being right there
but it's certainly worth the food, and it's suprisingly quiet, even with the close proximity to other people
I really recommend this place
This place is a stunning gem of a restaurant - real food with incredible flavours
brilliant, elegant plate presentations, excellent value, sweet, pleasant service, intimate atmosphere, but you can't say enough about the food - original tastes and textures, brilliantly conceived, ambitious but not overwrought or fussy
a fabulous find that should have a line out the door!
I love Tuna rolls and can't get enough - Sushi on Thursday nights is the way to go! Try the assortment or order something from the kitchen - either way you will enjoy it immensely!
I found this restaurant a few months ago, and every time go it just gets better and better
They recently expanded the menu, so now there are even more wonderful things to choose from
My friend did not lie when he said they have the best sushi in the area
Too bad they only offer it on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights
No wonder there were people waiting outside last time we were there
It's worth it! The Fuzzy Tuna roll and Fire Dragon are out of this world
The hot food is great too
Last time I had the hanger steak (practically melts in your mouth) and my friend had salmon with wasabi sauce
I recommend both
The prices are totally reasonable and the service is friendly and attentive
You can't go wrong
Sushi, lamb chops, steak and coconut shrimp all delicious
Just glad we still had enough room for the chocolate souffle
All I can say is yum!
This place might be small and hidden but it has a quaint charm with great flavors
WHEN I FISRT STEPPED FOOT INTO THE DOORS OF BISTRO, I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THIS SMALL PLACE HAS FABOLOUS DISHES
THE CEVICHE IS SO GOOD, EVERY BITE MAKES YOU WANT MORE
THE GUAVA SAUCE SPICED UP WITH THAI CHILIES,UNBELIVABLE AND MOUTHWATERING
I HAD THE DUCK WITH CHERRIES AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THE SAUCE AND CHERRIES COMPLIMENT THE DUCK LIKE YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE
THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL IN MY EYES IS THE DESSERT
(OMG) THE BREAD PUDDING AND THE CHOCOLATE OR WHITE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE ARE ALL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WHO HASENT HAD THEM YET
THUMBS UP FOR CHEF GARY AND HIS DISHES!!!!
If good news travels fast, then the word about Lil Bistro 33 should spread like wildfire
We heard about it from friends who live down the street and went as soon as it opened
What a cozy, charming place with GREAT food and friendly service
The menu is ecclectic with Japanese, French and Latin influences and everything was delicious - ceviche, miso soup, crabcakes and steak topped with blue cheese (yum!)
Thanks to citysearch I actually found this place
My boyfriend and I had our first of many wonderful dinners there
The owners are such nice people, they really cater to their clients
The chef and part owner is so into his new restaurant that his excitement is part of the experience of dining there
But the best part is their awesome food and the great prices! Their weekend sushi is out of this world and there is a lot to choose from
It is romantic and delicious and an overall feel good experience
Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!!!
I went there with my colleagues and we tried everything on the menu
The food was just delicious! After stuffing ourselves silly, we still ordered all the desserts and finished them in no time
Need I say more?
Found this place just walking by on my way home, and what a great discovery
This quaint little restaurant has kick-a@@ food! The ceviche is some of the best I ever had
We also tried the shrimp with mango salsa and gyoza -- both great
The lamb chops, seasoned with lemongrass are like nothing I've had before
I'm glad my friend ordered the banana crepes and was nice enough to share
I'll definitely be back for lunch
and dinner
I highly recommend this delightful dining spot
The menu is so interesting, along with the romantic atmosphere, and charming decor
The food presentation was done to perfection! And it wasn't just looks, it tasted delicious
We started with some sushi, my wife had the Godzilla Roll, she raved about it all weekend! I had duck for my entree, excellent! and my wife had the red snapper which she also loved
They also have some counter seats where you can see the Chef preparing the meals and the sushi!
This little place packs a lot of flavor, with a menu and wine list that are pretty extensive for a small restaurant
I had the added pleasure of trying it out on a Friday night when they offer a full sushi menu in addition to their regular selection
The sushi is really top notch, especially the Fuzzy Tuna rolls ( I think I'm addicted)
The staff is both friendly and efficient -- the chef even had us sample one of his new specials (the oysters are a keeper)
My date and I shared the lamb chops and the coconut shrimp - both were excellent
For dessert, even a self-confessed chocoholic like myself had a hard time deciding whether I liked the chocolate souffle or the banana crepe better!
My colleagues and I went to Lil' Bistro 33 to celebrate the holiday season
Everything on the menu sounded fantastic so, we ordered it all! Each dish was different and they were all amazing
Even the desserts are works of art
What a wonderful introduction to this terrific find in Queens
This is a great restaurant for appetizers and drinks or to eat a series of gourmet courses, all in a warm and inviting environment
Slightly bigger than a Manhattan apartment's kitchen, seats about 18 people, and is pretty non-descript from the outside
HOWEVER: the food is unparalleled, the service most excellent, and the prices, though not dirt cheap, certainly not exhorbitant, and definitely great value for money
Amongst the food, right from the soups, salads, appetizers, through the main course and the desserts - everything was excellent
We were a group of 12 people and thus had the ability to taste almost everything on the menu
The crabcake, though not at all bad, does not match up to the rest of the items on the menu - which far far exceed anyone's expectations
The edamame were not the best ever, either
However, EVERYTHING else was stupenduously delicious
Even the tofu steak - which, definitely was the best I've tasted anywhere
Amongst the desserts, the Chocolate dish and the banana coconut crepes are the yummiest
everything was good except the crab cake(it wasn't horrible but i've had better)
i don't know if this is a place to take your date to
i didn't think it was all romantic
looked more like a cafeteria with nice candle lights but their service was outstanding
they explain your questions thoroughly
Try their new zealand lamb chops and banana crepe dessert
they are really good and affordable

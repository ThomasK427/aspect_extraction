Definitely a must try!
The prices don't fit the neighborhood
Otherwise, outstanding restaurant - great food, great wine
I've gone to Carol's many times in the last year and no time has been a disappointment
The service is exceptional and staff very knowledgable
The food is always superb
Recommend Beef Wellington, lobster bisque and chocolate soufle when available
The pasta dishes are excellent and not the usual for Staten Island
If you want great pizza at a great price then this is your place
Fresh, quality ingredients
No canned toppings
Made to order, anyway you like it
Also make sure you try the chicken parmesan
You won't be disappointed
This place has the best pizza on the island
the neighborhood sux but they deliver! Best pizza I've had in a while
The food is incredible
The deserts are even better
They mostly serve sandwiches (such as prosciutto and fresh mozzerella on perfect bread) and pizza (possibly the best I've ever had), but its just incredible
The obvious bakery deserts are phenomenal, and so are other desserts like the sherberts
A tiny bakery on a busy street, but for some reason, I rate the ambiance high
Great place to go for a lunch date or for coffee after a date
My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out late one Friday night and we were not disappointed! The atmosphere is sophisticated and the food and service were very good
Young couples (like us) were continually coming in after 10pm
I believe they have a cigar bar on the other side of the restaurant
We like it!
Attended a party at this restaurant
Service from waiters and owner was extremely rude, insulting, and non professional to customers! Will never attend this restaurant ever again!
If you're seeking authentic Italian in a setting that screams old school, this place is it
I felt like the next time I looked up, I'd see Tony Soprano's ancestors gathered around one of the many tables
My boyfriend and I went one Friday night to find that the place was empty except for one other table
The friendly owner greeted us at the door
The large restaurant was anything but intimate and the decor of green and white left something to be desired
The food was pretty good but did not compare to our other favorite Italians on the island and the atmosphere kinda creeped me out
In one word? GREAT! The owner is always hospitable and goes the extra mile whenever possible
Joe Pernice makes you feel like one of the family - or his special guest
The food is simple and delicious featuring all of your familiar Italian favorites
It's the perfect place for groups or couples
Also offers free valet parking which helps when in Staten Island
It's the worst restaurant I've ever been
The waitress is rude and impolite
The food is not fresh
Not recommend at all
Don't even go near that place
It's a truely shame to staten island
Outstanding Veal Osobuco, complimented perfectly with Risoto Milanese - the best I've had in a long while!! Highly recommeneded!! Seafood selection extensive and of superior quality for Staten Island
I can't wait to go back!
By far, the BEST restaurant on Staten Island! Fantastic food, great service, and a cozy atmosphere
Easily deserves a 9
5 or higher!!
A wonderful dining experience
Hands down Staten Island's top Italian restaurant
Great food, outstanding service, and fantastic wine
Highly recommend the veal and seafood
Upstairs restaurant that is handicapped accessible provides fine Italian fare
Great deal that includes a full meal from appetizer to dessert from 14
95 to 21
95!
My girlfirend took me to here last night, and I was really impressed
The restaurant is on a quiet street, and you would never think that there was such a great place to eat there
The place was quiet and romantic
I thought the lamb chops were excellent, as was the goat cheese truffles we started with
The food was tasty, was of high quality and was presented well
And the service was great too
The wait staff paid attention when we needed something, but never spoiled the mood by being overbearing
I only wish we had time for dessert! Since it was cold outside, we didn't have an opportunity to sit in the garden that everyone is raving about, but I definitely want to go back to check it out along with the desserts! I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good romantic meal on Staten Island
Go to Aesop's Tables for a romantic night out in their wonderful garden and enjoy some delicious new-American food and some decent wine
Some of the dishes are hit or miss (bbq duck spring rolls = hit, pork tenderloin in sour cherry sauce = miss) but all in all it is a very enjoyable night
The service is good and the garden makes you feel like you are dining in a world far away from SI
You may pay a little more than you normally would on SI but it is still cheaper than Manhattan
Go and see for yourself
A great place for a cool summer evening meal
Eating outside in the garden was a treat
The food was inspired and the service was great
I'm looking forward to my next time here
The food and mood of Aesop's Tables are on equal par of greatness
(To be fair, I may be elevating it slightly because in Staten Island, although there are many good restaurants, there isn't much in the way of innovation as far as dining-out selections go)
My husband and I have been there at least a dozen times over the years since they've been open and have always been treated to the same fantastic food
The garden is particularly nice on warm days -- a fantastic oasis in which to take refuge after a long week
Good wine selection, excellent desserts from Brooklyn's Little Red Hen
The service can be a little hovering sometimes, but it's better than being ignored! Great French bistro feel inside -- the window displays are always a treat to look at, too
Do make the customer and his girlfriend wait 1 hour and 30 minutes - EVEN with a reservation  Do let them seat themselves inside - even though they had a reservation a week in advance for outside
Do treat them like rudly! Do Ignore them with Drama Queen, Diva flair
Do after making them wait close to 2 hours for a table, tell them ok the 2 measly drinks that they had were on the house
DON'T EVER GO TO AESOP'S TABLES ~~~!!!!!!
This place is great
John Toto is turning into one of NYC's hottest chefs!
The food is consistently good here but I wouldn't recommend the pizza
Go for the swordfish! The atmosphere leaves something to be desired as it somewhat reminds me of my college cafeteria but with table cloths
And if it's crowded, it can be as loud
However we've never had a problem being seated and the wait staff is very attentive
Another favorite on SI for this city girl!
Don't live there, but my son and his family live there
Every time I go to that area, I have to go to Cafe Pasta
Have never been disappointed with the food, or the service
The Scene The bright, cheery dining rooms are pungent with smoke from the wood-fired pizza oven, lively with conversation, and crowded with local families and the occasional gourmet pilgrim
Several doting waiters provide excellent service, even as they rush back and forth seemingly without a plan
The large windows look out on Hylan Boulevard's passing scene
The Food Despite the name, the home-style cuisine looks beyond Rome for inspiration
The enormous menu, bolstered by dozens of specials, includes pastas, pizzas, meat and fish, soups, salads, risotti, even a "low-cal" section

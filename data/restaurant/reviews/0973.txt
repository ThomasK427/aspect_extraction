the drinks were amazing
i couldnt get enough of the melba peach my boyfriend got hooked on the Alex
Our server was great and the manager came around and greeted us
I would recommend riingo for people who are looking to have a great meal without the attitude that a lot of 3 star restaurants have
also i enjoyed the happy hour and thursday friday nights DJ at riingo
Apparently there is a Sunday brunch jazz band which i look forward to seeing sometime
A group of 5 work buddies just got back from RIIgo
and all of us were unexpressed
the sushi in the bento box was TINY, and obviously a few days old
But to be fair the brazen short rib was fantastic
We were all lured here under the guise of the Kobe sushi roll
which to our disappointment was not available for lunch
The wait staff was very friendly and professional
Possibly this would be a great Dinner spot, but as for lunch, i would highly recommend avoiding it
A friend and I dropped by Riingo the other night and were sorely disappointed
The menu left much to be desired
The entrees didn't appear appealing or interesting
Among our selections were the braised beef in applesauce, the infamous kobe and green tea donuts - none of which were worthwhile or substantial
i mistook the braised beef for a brownie, we almost threw the kobe out thinking it was a dark piece of lettuce instead of two slivers of meat, and the only thing about the donuts that had anything to do w/ green tea was an eyedrop worth of ice cream! This place is far overpiced
The only positive aspects were the staff and the environment
Our waitress was very friendly and attentive but unfortunately NOT knowledgeable about the menu
She claimed EVERYTHING was great and had no useful suggestions
When I say focus I mean the main portion of a dish
For instance, the rare tuna dish had excellently prepared tuna but everything else that came on the plate was BELOW average
Subtle flavors can shine beautifully, but in this case the flavors were washed out, not subtle
I tasted more water in the sea beans than I did flavor
It's exactly what you would taste if preparing mashed potatoes at home and there's too much moisture in them when mashing
The same went for the shrimp, rice noodle salad with coconut milk
The shrimp were fabulously prepared but the overall flavor of the noodles wasn't there
There was a hint of the coconut milk but it was only in the small pool of liquid at the bottom of the bowl
With a name like Samuelsson behind it, I expected more solid follow through on everything
The food was absolutely delicious
The poor service received toke away from the experience
Our waitress was extremely lax about her job and was very slow
Need less to say, if you are looking for a quick bite or timely service, this is not the place to go
I had a really great meal here this past Monday-Really fresh, delicious sushi, the lobster roll was fantastic-The short rib-yum! Drinks-Asian Pear martini-best of it's kind I've ever had
Desserts-Donuts rival the donuts at Craft-yes, they're that good, so is the ice cream and sorbet- Go! It's great!
Great food, especially if you love tuna - it's everywhere on the menu! Interesting cocktails, loved the blood orange margarita! Very personable staff, especially the lady sushi chef
I had a special toro appetizer, lots of sushi, a side of shitake tempura and a terrific glass of wine(austrian pinot blanc?)
Was too full for dessert but was given wonderful little sweets before I left
Overall I was very well taken care of and look forward to my return visit
So, after a long week of work I was looking forward to trying out this semi-new restaurant and found myself in the middle of a pit of dining despair
The $14 martinis were decent but nothing better than the drinks I used to make at a chili's back in the day and they took forever to arrive
The appetizer was an uneventful experience at best and the steak I had for dinner tasted like it was from one of the diners at the South of the Border rest stop in South Carolina
My date's Mahi-Mahi was raw in the middle and had to be reserved
All of this for $170! This place is nothing more than a overpriced tourist trap and makes New York look bad
The owners should just close up and open a White Castle
Though their donut dessert was really good the food was just okay
Small portions and over priced
Marcus may have it all figured out with Aquivit but he is not on the top of his game at Riingo
The waitress was so bad that we had to ask twice for everything and she was neither friendly or helpful while we were trying to order
Riingo, like some other new and trendy eateries ubiquitous in NYC, makes fusion of traditional Asian cuisine with contemporary dazzle
However, I typically find that I leave such restaurants still hungry and much much lighter in the wallet
Anyway, it's a nice looking place and the wait staff were very friendly, but I just don't think it's worth the money
Alas, you pay so much for everything else in this city, what's the difference
I must say when you work near Grand Central, they are thousands of places to eat
But from now on there is only one as far as I am concerned
Great caesar salad with a spin
Great Chicken panini
Everything is done right and the service is quick and friendly
Can't wait to go back tomorrow
I recently stumbled on Riingo
I was very pleasantly surprised and charmed by the service and the food
The execution, presentation and flavors are that of a Three star restaurant and the servers navigate your experience with friendly complicity
A winner on all fronts
Try the edamame spread; I've become addicted
I am very impressed with Riingo
I usually don't like restaurants, but this one was a cut above some others
If I had my way, I'd eat at Riingo at least once a month, or maybe once a week
The brownies
fan-tastic!!! I think it wise to book a reservations - this place is very hot Hot HOT right now and sometimes I just sit at the bar
The bartenders are great - they sure know how to make a drink that is good!
I was planning a party for a senior member of our staff and called Riingo to check availability
They were very accomodating and we picked a fabulous menu which included a fantastic sushi/roll/sashimi platter to start
The presentation was fantastic and our attendees really enjoyed the course
We were able to customize our menu to include alot of american options, we even had a vegan in our group and the Chef came upstairs to make sure she ate exactly what she wanted
The service was phenominal thanks to an attentive staff
Cheers Riingo, we shall return!
We had a 8:00 reservation and upon arrival were told the table was not ready
But as we waited the hostess kept us informed of the table status and management offered us red apple martinis while we waited
Once seated, we were guided on an incredible journey by our server who was knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic throughout our meal
The timing of the food was perfect and we truly enjoyed every bite
The sushi was beautifully presented on large platters
We enjoyed the nori wrapped foie gras, tuna cesar and yellowtail sashimi
The snapper was an incredible dish served on the bone with a red miso broth
We don't know how but, we managed to save room for the green tea donuts and chocolate miso cake
The menu allows you many options and we will defenitely return for many more exciting dining experiences to come
I definitely would not go back to this place, although it is around the corner from my apartment
We had a reservation at 8, had to add one more person to our table, and it took them about an hour and half to 'reset' our table
I was tempted to go set it myself
The service was slow and the food was nothing amazing, especially for the prices
I would say its not worth your time
Pros: The service was outstanding, alot of personal attention from the server, manager, as well as other personnel nearby
We made a reservation for a Saturday night and was seated right away
The oyster roll had great textures, crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside
The sides: tempura mushrooms were great, crispy with filling
The desserts were increadible
Highly recommend the green tea donuts
It was a mix of different textures and tastes that were unique and surprising
Also good was the miso cake

I fell in love with this place
Wonderful food, romantic enviornment, friendly and helpful staff
Last week, I saw JAMES GANDOLFINI there!!! The rib eye with the bacon cheddar topping is uncontested
You too will love it, and that molten chocolate cake is unbelievable
GET THERE and you'll see what I mean! Enjoy
An exceptional night of dining out
Everything from food to service to atmopsphere is impecable
About as good as it gets
Dylan had terrific, perfectly cooked steaks and good service as well
The fondue appetizer is a great addition to the menu and the sides were all solid
The drinks were good and the music was very loungey
Overall, a great night out and I will definitely be returning soon
Dylan has it all
Great food, great drinks and great service
This place is a must for those that love to eat and drink and LOVE NEW YORK!!
Always perfect
Dylan is the perfect balance of casual elegance
Never stuffy or pretentious, but altogether the picture of class and refinement
In my dozen or so times here, the service has been infallible and the food, outstanding
One of the top 10 restaurants in the city, barnone
WOW
Love this place
Great comfortable environment
Freindly staff
A gerat place to meet people for drinks! Huge bar with lots of space and tables
The food is out of this world
I can't say enough good things!
MY WIFE AND I ARE FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO AND WE VISITED DYLAN PRIME IN MAY
WE'VE DINED SEVERAL TIMES IN NEW YORK THIS HAS BEEN ARE FAVORITE THUS FAR
THE STEAKS WERE UNBELIEVABLE AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT ALSO
OUR BILL WAS @ $90 FOR 2 PEOPLE
THERE IS ALSO A BAR ATTACHED WHICH WAS PERFECT FOR LATE NITE DRINKS
nice place, wonderful atmosphere, perfect lighting
good drinks
would have liked the food to have been prepared as requested
the waiter made one or two condescending comments but they got a laugh out of our party
some people would maybe not appreciate it however
all in all, a good experience
side dishes were great
I had just returned from Vegas, where I had one of the best steaks of my life at Emeril's place at The Venetian (Delmonico's)
Dylan's KC strip (bone in) was better
Probably eaten there four times, every time it's been excellent
When the room is hopping, it is one of the more wholly-enjoyable dining experiences in Manhattan
Good bar too!
We loved Dylan and glad it survived 9/11
The bar is cool and the restaurant is beautiful
The steaks are always perfect and the cocktails are delicious
I dined at Dylan on Saturday evening, 5/18 with 4 friends
The experience was almost perfection
The cheese fondue was fabulous and fun, the bibb lettuce salad with maytag blue cheese was delish and the filet mignon was by far, the best I've ever had
Try it with the black truffle sauce - a culinary delight
The only drawback was when the waiter kept addressing us as guys
In Short This pleasant bi-level bistro features a sky-lit dining room and spacious bar
The un-self-conscious charm comes with soaring ceilings, sunny yellow walls, warm wood floors and cozy barroom booths
Chef Stephen Lyle likes to liven up classics with international flavors, like adding chipotle and cilantro to an oyster pan roast and lemongrass curry to mussels, while keeping standards like steak frites and braised lamb as classic as can be
Went to Village last night for my birthday
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect
We were very pleasantly surprised
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
Is how you correct your mistakes
We've had dozens of fine meals here
Two visits ago, a really, truly dreadful one
With bad attitude from the hostess as well
Next day, we called
THEY LISTENED
Begged us to come back
We did, and they comped us on the whole meal, every last drop of it
you are good customers, you deserve better
And the hostess is no longer employed there
Mistakes happen
How you fix them is how you keep customers
We'll be back again
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier
After calling every restaurant in the West Village/Meatpacking district, found this restaurant
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20
No $6,000 minimum or 'we'll have to split your group b/w 6 tables
' And at 8:30p on a Fri! Excellent meal, service (very accommodating) ambience - I highly recommend this I'm VERY picky!
This is a true gem of the village
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome! - i asked for them spicy and they were delicious)
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine
They even sent us a dessert on the house because they thought we would like it (and it was amazing-panna cotta!!!-so very yummy)
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place
One of the worst brunch experiences I've ever had
The menu was pitiful
We were seated for at least 20 minutes before we could flag down someone to take our order
We ended up giving our order to the hostess, who was slightly testy
It was also a battle to get our checks
The diners next to us commserated with us about the absentee servers, so at least we weren't the only diners to be ignored
The food is decent, but it's overpriced
It's too bad, because the restaurant is beautiful and i live in the neighborhood, but I've sworn off this place
We dined here because we were looking for a restaurant where we could have a nice meal on a Saturday evening with a 2-year old in tow
This turned out to be the perfect place
The service was great and the staff was very helpful in offering us a couple of seating options to accomodate our son
The food was excellent

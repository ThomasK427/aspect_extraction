The food was wonderful and at a great value
It's crowded, but the casual and intimate setting was perfect for an evening out with friends
Bello Giardino is great for lunch
The lunch menu special includes soup or salad with a pasta dish
You can sit out side where there is a beautiful pation surrounded by trees
Inside is very romantic and rustic
The food is yummy too! I had my bridal shower here and they were very accomodating for 20 guests and they kept the lunch special on a Saturday
The only problem is they don't take credit card but it's all worth it
This is an authentic old school neighborhood kosher deli dating back about 80 years, when the Upper West Side was home largely to first generation Jewish people from Eastern Europe
They've lasted that long without being featured in movies and without the benefit of the tourist market for one reason: the food is damn good
While the atmosphere is a bit spartan, it's been renovated recently, the place is clean and the pastrami and such are as good as if not better than any other, more famous or glitzy deli in NYC
If you're on the UWS, there is no other deli that comes close in terms of authenticity and quality
PS While not as famous as the Theater District delis or where Harry met Sally, there is a celebrity connection
Fine Schapiro is a favorite of some well-known Upper West Siders whose photos you can see behind the counter, and who stop by in person on occasion as well
The Scene  This cozy upscale haunt once catered to a cutting-edge art crowd, which explains the blush-inducing nude murals
Mirrors multiply the frolicking wood nymph paintings and plush yet stodgy decor, making the two small dining rooms and bar seem larger than actual size
Owners George and Jenifer Lang oversee an expert team of venerable waiters who pamper tourists, moneyed regulars, and, increasingly, serious foodies
The Food Rather than cast aside the old French standbys, chef Ari Neimenin has discreetly updated them while adding intriguing new ones
Brown-buttered Dover Sole is still succulent, and fat-laced pot au feu is rich as ever in beefy consomm with baby vegetables
The famed "salmon-four-ways" has spawned a fifth: don't miss the plate of house-cured, poached, smoked, gravlaxed and tartared fish
Freshness prevails, from crisp endive-stilton salad to steely sardines, char-grilled with a zippy lemon-tomato salad
Top prize goes to tea-smoked duckling with buttery confit and braised, cinnamon-stoked cabbage
Lovely gem
The bar in the restaurant is like something out of a Hitchcock movie -- old-fashioned, intimate and classy
Food was overall very good if pricey
I had the fixed price menu with salmon
The sweet corn quinoa with wild mushrooms was scrumptious
The salmon was so-so
When asked what the waitress recommended she just named a few things off the menu without saying why
She seemed a bit annoyed and holier than thou
Sorry, but service in the South at fine restaurants (Commander's Palace in New Orleans, City Grocery in Oxford, MS) where they delight in telling you the food's preparation, flavors and textures is far superior to that I have seen in some of NY's swankiest restaurants
Overall, though, I would definitely go back -- it's got a magical, romantic, old-school feel -- good for parents or dates
Bring a loaded wallet
Brunch at Cafe des Artistes was hands down the most terrible dining experience I have had in New York
Not only was the menu absurdly overpriced, but the limited selection of food was bland and had clearly been prepared in advanced and spent the morning under heat lamps
Honestly, I have eaten better tasting food on an airplane
The service was atrocious- rude, hurried, unaccommodating, sloppy
Orders were confused over 4 times, and servers rolled their eyes and treated their error as it had been our fault
Atmosphere is stuffy and stale, not even snobby and pretentious like some traditional places- just plain bad
To top it off, what should have been a simple bill for a party of 6 at prix fixe menus was extremely confusing (multiple charges for a penny to every meal- what?!)
Would advise anyone who enjoys food, atmosphere, or service to steer clear of here
If you enjoy being surrounded by people of an average age of 60 then this is the place for you
We were there from 5:30 through 7pm (thought that maybe a younger crowd shows up at night), the place was a little loud, not romantic at all, and the food was really average
The food was good but nothing that will be memorable
Whenever my husband and I are in the city we would not go to any other restaurant
We find the whole experience enjoyable
The food is excellent and the service is impeccable
I was very excited about coming here for Valentine's Day - it had the reputation of being a nice romantic restaurant
What a letdown! The tables are cramped and so close together we could hear every word of the conversations around us
The service was very slow, and the food was not good at all
The dover sole was way overcooked, and the steak was awful
The salad was fine, and the dessert was nothing special
I would never come back
I went to CDA on my birthday last year and had THE BEST meal of my life
I went back this year on my birthday again, with high expectations, mind you, and the restaurant exceeded my expectations and gave me yet another meal for the books
Everything they put on the table is guaranteed to be fantastic
Unlike some of the other restaurants boasting high ratings and higher price tags, the food and experience at Cafe des Artistes was worth every penny
Everything we ordered was spectacular - salmon four ways, dover sole, nantucket cod, and pecan pie
While the decor was nothing extravagant, the restaurant's ambience was relaxed and cozy
The service was top notch - our waiter was very informative and attentive without putting on airs
Cafe des Artistes exceeded my expectations in every way!
My Boyfriend brought me here for my birthday we had reservations for 7:30 and we were seated right away
The restuarant is beautiful and they gave us our own little tucked away part that was so romantic
The only downside was that was the bar was right next to us and there was 3 intoxicated people being obnoxious
But The food was amazing and the service was fast and friendly
I recommend The Argula watermelon and pross
Salad the flavors were so good
Loved It
For starters my girlfriend had the Vichyssoise soup which was quite nice and I had the Mixed Greens salad which had fresh lettuce but the dish was uninspired
For desert she had the Strawberry Shortcake and I the Chocolate Mouse, both of which were average for a Cafe
Now the problem was with the entrees
Both of us had the Salmon, hers was supposed to be medium-rare, one side was medium and the other rare with a 1 section in the middle being properly cooked
Mine was supposed to be medium and ended up overcooked to the point of dryness
The meat was decent but the chef was not paying attention
Service was quite friendly and decor was average, the murals were pretty but nothing else was special
YYMV, we visited for Restaurant Week so the quality of the food may have been below normal standards because of the crowds
One of the most memorable dining experiences I have had in NY
Foie Gras, salmon seven ways
perfectly paired wines with every course
The staff is amazing
truly quintessention New York, but the way I imagine society NY to be in the 40's or 50's
incredibly polite, gallant even
sophisticated and extremely knowledgable
Though the crowd is a bit more mature than a typical New York hot spot, if you are looking to impress a classy woman, look know further
I recently got re-introduce to the cafe about two weeks ago
I have to say that I have been missing out for all these years
My parents used to go to the cafe when they had theatre tickets
The greeting at the door is incredible they really welcome you into their home
The service is warm, kind and knowledgable
The food is exceptional!! The Scallop dish is fantastic
They do something called club service where they make the drinks at your table(this really impressed me and my date)
The desserts are just as good, try the fondue for two
Tell all your friends about this place and they will be impressed too!
12/24/03  Dinner was ok, service was so- so,the worst part was the hostess - we made reservations a month before Christmas Eve for three people, you would think the table would be large enough for all three of us
That was not the case the table was the size for two- it was not only very cramped, this was also the table that was right before the bathroom
and the broom station
The price you pay for this type of restaurant - you would think that they would have better setting arragements
I can tell you that the hostess should have know better than to sit people near a toliet
Would she do that at home?? The only reason why we stayed at this place is because we were hungry
Very pretty place

The experience was good, but the details of service were lacking
My boyfriend and I tried Caravan for the first time the other night, and loved it! We had the miso deluxe appetizer the tropical thai salad, with a chai latte a green tea with mint
AMAZING freshness and flavor
If you love to be healthy, and are tired of the same old thing, definitely swing by Caravan
You'll love it
as a raw vegan, it's pretty hard to get delicious food in this city
caravan of dreams has delicious and creative raw and living entrees, with a fun ambience
the only thing i hated was the music - a sort of ravi shankar-ish sitar, REALLY annoying, but other than that the service was friendly, though i agree it's not the fastest in the world
oh! one thing to look out for - if the prices seem a little steep, it's because the portions are GIGANTIC
you may want to just split one with a friend :) by way of appetizers, the nachos are fantastic, and the brownie dessert is too
viva la caravan of dreams!
As a non-vegetarian, I have frequently dined at many vegetarian/vegan restaurants courtesy of my vegetarian sister and Caravan of Dreams is one such place
Other menu items are for the most part okay, but to ensure that we won't be disappointed
we usually order the quesadillas which are mmmmm, mmmm good
As indicated in the title, don't plan on being somewhere else immediately afterwards
Though you are seated promptly, the waitstaff is a little slow when it comes to acknowledging your presence, remembering your orders, and bringing your check
On the other hand, the kitchen staff is quite quick in turning the food around once your order does arrive
Overall, a decent place to get some food
The food varies in consistency
Some dishes are good some days and not on others
The paella manages to stay ok
Their fruit shakes and smoothies are refreshing in the summer, however avoid the desserts
The desserts are either bland or too sweet
Because it is one of the few raw food establishments in the city there is a sense of preening self righteousness, as though you should be glad they exist
I have eaten at Caravan several times, and it's a hit-and-miss
Some of the food is pretty tasty, some hardly edible (unfortunately I dont have enough writing space to give detailed examples)
Overall the place needs much improvement: the seating is not particularly comfortable, the staff is non-responsive, it's very noisy - the ceiling is low so normal conversation sounds louder, and add to that loud music, a noisy AC, and a very noisy blender that's right smack close to the eating area - and you've got one big headache
In a work, Caravan caters to a forgiving crowd that cares more about it being vegan than tasty
On the positive side, the prices are reasonable
So, if youre looking for a vegan place for a reasonable price, go to Caravan, and dont expect too much
A great place to have very tasty, living food
Caravan can be a little slow sometimes, but more than makes up for it in the quality of the food and the care of wait staff
This restaurant is a must for serious vegetarians visiting Manhattan!
Went here with a few friends and found the food excellent
All our dishes were extremly flavorful and not too pricey
If you are not in a rush, as the waitstaff is not quick, this is a great place!
My boyfriend and I are regulars here and neither of us are vegan, but we LOVE it! I have never been disapointed by anything I order
The food is always fabulous! The wait staff is a little flaky expecially about bringing the check but it is worth it for the food
Everything is great but try the Lover's Salad!
This resteraunt is such a great place for Vegans
I love it
As a full-fledged non-vegetarian, I was quite reluctant to go to vegan restaurant but as my three companions were all vegetarian, I didn't have much of choice
But much to my surprise, the food was wonderful - I would strongly recommend the Open-faced mushroom sandwich
The service was good, with the exception of my waitor who seemed to take his time but the manager more than made up for service with his friendliness
A GREAT PLACE for couples or groups and for vegetarians or non-vegetarians
In Short Benny's is a lively, slightly kitschy spot (Haight Street-meets-1960s surfers' den) that serves large portions of made-to-order Tex Mex for relatively low prices
East Villagers stream in for sit-down meals or takeout, and call ahead for neighborhood delivery
The lengthy menu includes veggie, bean, cheese and meat-filled burritos, as well as classic tacos and tostados
throwing salsa on a dish does not make it Mexican, but this place which used to have some decent dishes, spinach tortilla pie, is nothing but glorified NYU food
I've been here more times than I can count and it never disappoints
Now, obviously it's not gourmet Mexican food, but its tasty and the margaritas kick ass
I've spent many nights stumbling home from Benny's
You can't go wrong
Non-cooking, vegetarian New Yorker's dream: Order a veggie burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, black beans, guacamole and all the fixins and you'll have the day's meals taken care of
For a 13 buck burrito I was expecting a 5 inch thick MF of fillings, but it was flat
Granted it was 13 inches long (ok people get your mind outta the gutter), but it was flat
Average place
There are better burrito joints on st marks
Some people will appreciate the healthy options here like tofu sour cream, whole wheat tortillas and vegetarian chorizo, but the food barely resembles Mexican food, and can be quite bland
I thought it was worth it when I first started coming here several years ago, but now that prices have escalated over the years, Benny's is too expensive for what it offers
For real Mex with a lot more character, try Festivale Mexicana or El Cantinero
Lousy Mexican food, way overpriced
Flavorless chicken, never very fresh tasting
Good only for giant margaritas on the sidewalk
Do yourself a favor and head to Mexico Magico just up the street
In Short Acting as his own architect, co-owner John Brennan designed a rustic space with exposed-brick walls, wood beams, a mural of the Italian countryside and an open kitchen
It's just the sort of homespun spot found in neighborhoods throughout the city
The northern Italian fare follows a simple path, using fresh ingredients and delivering straightforward, balanced flavors
Pasta is a house favorite, as is the creamy polenta served with ground pork and sauteed wild mushrooms
I saw I Coppi on a TONY Time Warner Cable review on Outside Gardens and i thought it might be the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to go for our 1 Year Anniversary
It says on the Citysearch review that it's not recommended for kids
romantic
etc
but when we walked in on Friday night at 7:30, there was a giant family dining with 6 kids
I saw a fair share of senior citizens too
Granted, it was on the early side, but THIS IS THE EAST VILLAGE
What happened? A buzzkill, when i had dressed up in provovative chic
Our table was in the garden, which is tiny, and when i asked to sit at a bigger table, they said the 3 seaters are reverved for larger parties
10 minutes later, a couple was sitting there
The Garden is ok, but it's covered
Our food was bland, and we didn't finish it
Wine List was good, service adequate
Trust me, and save it for a non occasion where you just need a place to go if you are in the neighborhood
Seated right away, good
Garden, lovely
Winelist, great
Bread, served too late
Half order pastas, good
45 minute wait for entre, bad
Asking about why the entrees took this much time, WORST
We simply asked what the holdup was, and the waitstaff said I dont know, I just asked the same question
You can ask the chef on your way out, very dismissively
At which my companion replied, very politely, That is your job, to communicate our question to the kitchen
She replied You dont have to be nasty to me, this is the last time Im talking to you and stormed off
Never have I been disrespected like this
We went directly to the owner and complained that such behavior does not befit such a charming establishment, and left without touching our food
It just goes to show, food alone does not make a restaurant great
This place is really fantastic
Yes, it is a little pricier than most italians in the east village, but it is worth it
Every time I have gone it has been a memorable event

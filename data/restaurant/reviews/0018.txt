The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers
Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over
Perhaps
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok
Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date
This place is great
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal! Service was prompt, friendly and great
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
Cafe Spice is a beautiful restaurant, with a warm ambience (especially the booths)
The wait for 2 on Sat
at 9pm with no reservations was only 5 minutes
Service was friendly and fast
The food was very tasty and there were several vegetarian options
Specifically the dahl is some of the best in town
If you order the platters all of your typical Indian side items are included so it is a good value
One of my new favorite Indian restaurants
I can't comment on how authentic it is, but it was pretty darn good! Interestingly I saw 2 tables with kids who seemed to like the food too, so that was fun
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not
The kitchen however, is almost always slow
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best
Sometimes serving good food does not mean your customers SHOULD be happy
I was told I need to pay for additional cup of tea if I want to REFILL HOT WATER, even though what I ordered was just a Lypton black tea
Astonished was how i looked
Feeling ridiculous so just told myself not go there anymore
I've been to Cafe Spice several times, and while the food has always been good, the service ranges from mediocre to awful
My most recent visit was my last - the behavior of our waitress was almost shocking
When she wasn't being sarcastic or downright rude, she spent her time studiously ignoring our table or pointing us out to the other waitstaff
I've always been an overgenerous tipper, but it was a stretch to justify even the couple of bucks we left her
The food's good, but I won't be back
I love the food here, and although it is pricey, the entree comes with rice, naan, dal, and salad, which makes it worthwhile
It is better to make reservations because the place is always full
The service is also slow
For appetizer, I like Potli Samosa, but sometimes it is improperly cooked, which ruins the taste
I love the spice content of food, which suits my traditional Indian taste for spicy food!!
Ordered appetizer and entree and had to wait 40 mins only for us to flag the waitress down and ask her if we were going to get the food
She replies, You should have told me before
She then goes to to the kitchen, which is in plain view, and grabs the food off the steel shelves
Apparently its the customer's job to remind the waitress to bring the food
As for the food, it was terrible
Being an Indian myself and having been to many restaurants, there was simply no taste
About the only thing somewhat good was the naan, which you can't really mess up
If you want to have the taste of India check this out
The ambience makes you feel good
The reasonably priced mouthwatering delicasies would tempt you to dine at cafe spice everytime you are in New york
I dined at Cafe Spice last week with 4 other friends
Lucky enough to get a booth
The food was great and the servers went out of the way to help me select the right dish
We ordered a platter that was an asssortment of appetizers which was great recomendation
The drink specials(lychee martini) also were great
Making a prior reservation is advisable
I have been there couple of times and its a nice place
good food, quiet and excellent service
I love this place for food as its filling
I would recommend this place for a date or to have fun
While you kind of have to pump the waitress to identify whats really going on on the menu, this is a great place to take someone who isnt entirely familiar with indian food
Its yummy, its fusion, the cocktails are tasty and if you can reserve a booth, you will probably score with your date
This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
It is expensice, but the portions are big and include a side, salad, nan and rice along with your main meal! Great ambiance (I love the mirror above the bar!) and great food! You can't go wrong!
Indian food shouldn't cost this much, especially when it's a 10 minute walk over to Indian Row
but it's a charming place but the service is decent and it's in a great neighborhood


because i adhere to the idea that indian food should be cheap, and not at all fancy
that's one of it's joys
but this place is really good - spicy, good taste variety, etc
The food and portions were really good, although a little bit pricy
The service was decent
Atmosphere is fun
Nice little restaurant for a taste of Tikka
good food, service was real slow
our entree took 45 mins to get
Did give us free dessert for that
Would reccomend having a a variety of 3-4 appetizers as they are very good
The Shrimp achari Chicken are the best!
I have been to this restaurant many times and I have never had a bad experience
The food is good and the decor is very nice
It can get noisy sometimes so I would't recommend it for a romantic evening or a date
Go with your friends and have fun!
Went there and ordered tandoori fish
was fishy and terrible
overpriced
my date's non veg thali was really expensive and had like one or two pieces of meat in each sauce
the trendy atmosphere and high price fooled me into thinking that somehow the food would be innovative
unfortunately overall the food was mediocre at best
Brought friends there who enjoyed it very much
Large portions for small prices
Had to wait for a bit, but well worth it
The (Indian) food is good but much too expensive
For that price I expect a little more
The food is not Thai as one reviewer suggests

Atmosphere is perfect for all kinds of people
Dates, groups, parents, kids
Best of all though is the Karaoke in the besement
There are huge couches for you to lounge in, no stage so you can sing right at your seat
I live in the neighborhood and was a big fan of Tacu-Tacu until a bad delivery experience
I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and definitely prefer the Peruvian side of the menu
Their asian food suffers when compared to the rest of the neighborhood
My roommate and I ordered one night and her meal was wrong
We called and had to argue with the guy for 5 minutes before he agreed to bring over the right food
He brought her a tiny takeout container with 3 shrimp and less than a handful of the noodles that should have come with her meal
It was insulting
Also, the service in the restaurant is SLOOOOWWW but I think that's a Williamsburg-wide problem
My son and I stopped by Laboratorio del Gelato after a visit to the Tenement Museum
Luckily, we stepped into the small shop when there were only 4 or 5 people in line
I had the lime and mint sorbet and the strawberry sorbet
WOW! The lime and mint was SO refreshing, tart and flavorful
The strawberry tasted exactly like fresh strawberries
I have to say that the lime was really the best I had ever had
Sure wish I had the recipe! Please stop by--and visit the Tenement Museum, too! A crowd came in as we were leaving--we timed it just right
(Sorry, we didn't try the gelato)
Some of the best sorbets and gelato I have ever had (even compared to Rome)
The fruit tastes just explode in your mouth! Unfortunately, they only serve a handulf of flavors by the scoop (I guess more available ready-packed)
Beware the unruly crowds that fill up their extremely tiny counter area - the last experience I had was so bad that I won't be going back anytime soon
I had to have the best in NYC (which this was rated in May)
Not the easiest place to find, and very disappointing
I had better on Bleecker and in Little italy
For the best gelato east of California, be sure to stop in and visit this modest establishment on the Lower East Side and you will see for yourself why it was voted Best of New York 2004
The owner, Jon Snyder, has a talent for producing the creamiest and tastiest gelato I've ever had
He also offers a selection of sorbets as well
Flavors like caramel, vanilla, black sesame, strawberry, and lavender are all lovely and burst with such incredible, true to the source, flavor
The last time I was there, I had the yellow plum sorbet and it was like biting into the actual fruit
Yummy!
The Scene Expecting a warm welcome after that long trek from the F train? Well, forget it
The 30-something regulars who vie for curmudgeonly co-owner Arnaud Erhart's attention cast a food-serious mood over the sky-lit banquettes
Here's a tip: Ask the Balthazar alum about his steely Fisher's Island oysters (Fed-Exed daily) and organic wines, and he'll not only warm up, but likely reward you with off-menu options and gratis tastes
The Food Parisian chef and co-owner Sebastien Smits' three-course, $25 menu is a steal for the classic, carefully-prepared dishes
Roasted scallops and favas in buttery lobster coulis, tender leek vinaigrette and creamy carrot-cumin soup all impress
Simpler entrees, like organic chicken fricasse with piney rosemary rice and crispy cod in sweet tomato concasse, are equally impressive
Try any of the "petite faims" surcharges (garlicky frogs' legs are a favorite), and refuse to leave before they bring you creme caramel
I had dinner at 360 for the first time last night and it was fabulous
The gnocchi appetizer melts in your mouth and there was an incredibly refreshing cucumber, yogurt, dill soup
The entrees were a pan seared duck breast, roasted chicken breast and roasted hake (fish)
All of them were amazing
And the chocolate bread pudding for dessert was the best chocolate dessert I've had in a long time
Oh and the cheese course before dessert was unique and varied
Very pleasant atmosphere and staff
And you can't beat the $25 fixed price
Definitely make reservations!!
Everything was fresh and delicious, and interestingly prepared
We had the hearty lamb stew and the rosemary fish soup (I forget the fancier French names)
We also had a creamy risotto appetizer and a deliciously smokey squash soup
Beautiful flavors, homey food
Perfect portion sizes
And the desserts were fantastic
we had THREE! The hazelnut cake was surprising and fantastic, and the lime tart was superbly tangy
We were so enamoured of the food that we made a reservation on our way out for the following week
I adore this place
This is what a restaurant should be: good food, real service, diverse wine no pretension
If you can't handle the trek or the fact that you have to bring cash along, then just stay home and don't bother ruining it for the rest of us
The wait staff was friendly and no frills: they made sure we had what we needed and let us be
The food was solid and traditional with a winner of a Steak Tartare
No surprises, none of the fluff of Manhattan restaurants with all hype and no return
From someone who eats out 6 days a week, this little spot was a lovely change from the snobbery that has overcome New York dining
Long live their Tarte aux Pommes!!!
What an incredible value
3 courses ($25) of very well executed, imaginative food
Wine list features a lot of small producers,almost exclusively organically farmed vineyards at fantastic prices (Nothing above $50 with the majority around $20-25) The menu changes everyday and they always have fish and meat on it
The room is cozy but quite small, so reservations are a must
the place was packed !Service was casual yet very pro and all their recommendations were right on
It's definitly worth the trip to Red Hook (not that bad after all !)
This is just an excellent french bistro
You would pay much more for much less in Manhattan
Wines are served at cellar tempurature, which I really appreciate
It's all about the daily prix fix menu
Not pretentious, just yummy
Went to 360 last night on a date
It's a bit of a walk from the F-train Smith 9th stop, but that's ok
Found the dishes to be either very good, or very bad, and the service gracious
Started off with a wine list that lacked variety, and then a red that was chilled, then enjoyed a lovely lentil soup
We both unfortunately chose the lamb shank, which was delivered bland and soaking in tasteless white bean soup
My date sent his lamb back and was greeted with a yummy chicken dish in its place
I slugged it out with my lamb, and lost the battle
The pear tart was fantastic, and the tarte au chocolat flat and too thick to eat
Good luck!
we didn't have any 'owner nightmare' issues at 360
we found a very pleasant and knowledgeable staff, a terrific wine list, an interesting menu, and very reasonable prices
the food was delightful, but the dinner was paced really fast - granted we ordered from the fixed price menu, but it was so fast that it was almost impossible to finish a bottle of wine
also, in regards to the wine, the bottle came to our table already open - not a huge issue as it was a fine bottle, but kind of odd
Let me first say the food is very good and the price is very reasonable
360 is a cool spot and Red Hook is definitley a great place to check out
But the attitude of the owner is enough to keep me away for good
He should set up shop in Soho if he wants to vibe his customers the way he does
It was utterly painful for him to leave mushrooms off the fish
You'd think a tourist running a somewhat succesful business would have more to smile about
I almost didn't want to write this review because of the threat that I won't be able to get a reservation if it gets any more crowded
The $25 prix fixe is deceiving as a bargain
With a bottle of wine and small plate of cheese, dinner for two ran up to $120
But every bite and sip was worth it
We split the calamari salad and beet salad to start (beets were wonderful), chicken and skate for entree (skate was incredible), cheese (nice array), and rice pudding and tart for dessert (adequate)
The prospect of a new menu daily makes me want to come back often

The food was sorely lacking
The bread used for the sandwiches and scones were stale
For the price, the food should be much better
Beware, if you order the Mad Hatter for 2, you cannot share with a third person
I went with 2 other people and we shared the Mad Hatter, but of course, we were told after we had shared
The waitress knew we were sharing but kindly reminded us after the fact that the Mad Hatter is only for two
First thing
make reservations if you are going on a weekend
We tried unsuccessfully to eat brunch on a weekend without reservations
The wait was crazy long, so we gave up
We went back on a weekday and there wasn't any wait
The crepes with honey creme are out of this world!
I love this place!!! I've been going since they opened and never tire of it
It makes me forget about the hustle and bustle of NYC while I'm there sipping tea and eating delicious food and even more delicious scones
Please don't ever leave us!!
I had the best PBJ sandwhich at the UWS location
I think it genius to use banana bread -- the best of both worlds
The variety of tea is great along with the mismatched teacups -- loved it! Can't say enough good things about my visit!
We went to the new Eastside location with a large group to celebrate the holidays
We made reservations and were NEVER told about the requirement that a large group order $33 a piece meals! When we exlplained that we were never told this they said tough and that we had to either do that or leave AND if we left they would charge the credit card our reservation had been made under
We wanted to stay and would have ordered quite a bit of food but wanted the option to order a la carte instead of prix fix
We ended up leaving
They were INCREDIBLY RUDE and not at all flexible! Not to mention they made us wait 45 minutes for our table
I never in my life have had such a RUDE experience
They lost a lot of money from 10 ladies that Sunday afternoon
I might like the place if I never had any high tea in my life
The place was very nice, good location, small cozy BUT they really need to improve the service and the food
Five of us order three differences tea and end up only one was the correct order
We had no complaint of the tea they provided after we got the right one; not excellent tea but at lease it wasnt bad
But the food was mediocre
We had ordered the high tea set, which come with associated muffins, scones, cookies and sandwiches
The muffins and scones, cookies were all crudely made, barely up to the standard, and the sandwiches as well, the bread was dry, feels like two days ago bread
All of us were very disappointed of this high tea experience at Alice, especially after reading so many great reviews here
I adore this place and anyne i know who has been there has not a bad word to say about it
the little shop in the front is wonderfull displying the amazing cakes and yummy cup cakes
Being English am most inpressed by the tea varieties certainly do not have that at home
the sit down food is delicious can definatly reccomend the blueberry pancakes really fluffy with fresh fruit
the service is friendly and efficiant and the decor is cute
Best way to start the day
The only con which isnt really a con i suppose is that 8 of went there on a saturday for brunch but they were totally full for the next 2 hours
which is to be expected really
Great for everyone really
i think litle girls or big girls would particually get a kick out of it
I was reading the negative reviews of Alice's Tea Cup, and I was shocked
and then I realized some of them were over 2 years old
my friends and I go there all the time (one friend even had a bridal shower there) and we have never had a bad time
The servers greet us like old friends, it is one of the most charming places in New York, and the scones and food overall are unbeatable with the atmosphere
its all sugar and magic at Alice's Tea Cup
I am extremely surprised at the poor reviews! I discovered this adorable place approx
1 year ago
It is intimate and cozy, the furniture is a hodge-podge of mis matched antique chairs
I am not a high tea connoisseur as we we usually just order a simple black tea
However, I am a scone fan and these are the absolute best I have EVER had; light and moist with wonderful flavors all of which are fantastic
My husband loves the banana chocolate chip, last time I had raspberry/coconut and cinammon walnut
We love the sandwiches
each sandwich comes on a wonderful different type bread
Two of our favorites are ham/gruyere on semolina/raisin and smoked chicken with apples on seven grain
The waitresses are friendly with no attitude at all
I recommended to my parents and they adored it too
You will not be disappointed with this quaint and reasonable priced spot!
Great little place
The best tea list I have seen yet--they have many rare green teas
The sandwiches were good and the scones and cookies were delicious
We got one of the combo plates, Mad Hatter, which was enormous even for 2
The place is not cheap, but as a sometimes tea joint, it hits the spot
well
i am a big tea fun-i highly appreciate tea time and tea places
this one was average
the setting not my style
the waitors keep on getting in and out of the kitchen which is placed right next to the tables
and the relaxing experience becomes a bit stressy
the scone was great, freshly baked and fluffy but you apparemtly have to wait 20'
and my tea came quite late too
and the place wasn't that busy, just 3 parties or so
pretty pricy too
on my way out i purchased some tea from the retail at the front and i payed $25 for 3 oz of chai's
i don't know- it's a childish place, more British oriented, and not that great
i wouldn't go again, i can't spent that much time and $$ for what i finally got there
This used to be a charming little spot
However, on a recent visit, the place was swarming with tourists (thank you SO much Mary Kate and Ashley)
We were seated in the airless back room, served expensive watery tea, and gererally ignored
The busboy parked himself at the service station across from our table during his down time and stared at us
We wondered if he was hungry or just trying to pick up a date for Friday night
All in all, this was a miserable experience
This is NYC, there are other tea places!
This is the most horrible tea experience I had EVER
The staff is rude and downright mean
The scone is good, but the sandwiches are really, really bad
worse than your local deli
And it is quite expensive for what it is
I'm not sure what a previous poster was saying about it being much better priced than high tea
for a comparable cost, you can get better food and service at the Palm or Payard
unless you want to get treated terribly
I know it's the busy holiday season, but the service we received was unreal
Our cashier made several rude comments because we preferred a cheaper tea strainer
She then overcharged us significantly, admitted her mistake, but claimed she was too busy to do anything about it
I couldn't believe it
I thought I had found a great place - but it wasn't worth getting treated like dirt
This place is great
I don't at all agree with the previous reviewer's comments on the food or the price

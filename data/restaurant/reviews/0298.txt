But the restaurant, like the neighborhood, has a very comfortable feel, and the outdoor seating is a nice bonus
The portions are probably a little smaller than average, but they are perfectly adequate, and probably reflect the restaurant's emphasis on quality, not quantity
We've had good experiences with Magnolia
It's a lovely restaurant with good food and a fantastic value $20 prix fixe menu
Our waiter was nice and professional (although the restaurant could use more than one waiter)
I find Magnolia to be consistently good and everyone is very nice!
The food in this place is as good as I've ever had in far more expensive restaurants
How do they do it? It's true that the service is a little spotty, but the overall ambiance is attractive and relaxing, and who cares about anything else after such a wonderful meal
We went to Magnolia soon after moving to Brooklyn b/c it looked like it could be great
It failed at every level
We were kept waiting for a table for an hour even though there were always one or two empty
After being seated, we waited over 15 minutes to order our drinks
Dinner was unremarkable, the wine list was weak and the service was unattentive and slow
We ordered the recommended dessert ahead of time as they suggested but when it came time for it, the waiter had forgotten it
It's just too bad that the guy behind me who did not order it, but requested it after dinner, get it about the same time
For some reason, these guys are trying to impress all the wrong people
The food was very good
The staff was attentive and made themselves available without hovering
I will go there again because of the staff alone
The bartender makes a great martini
What can I say about Magnolia - They are the best
Emanuele was the best waiter we have ever had anywhere, he was attententive and very pleasant
The bartender Biloxy Johnny makes the best to die for Mango Martini's on the planet
The garlic mashed potatoes that came with my New Orleans chicken melted in my mouth
The salad was great, the appetizer wings were also great
I cant say enough good things about this place
The owner and the bartender comes to your table to ask how things are (unless they are extremely packed)
Overall the best food, service, and drinks ever
The total package
I dine out at least four times per week, and honestly this is the only restaurant where I get good food good service and great drink and a wonderful atmosphere
Last night I had the most amazing meal at Magnolia
The spice rubbed grilled scallop appetizer with avocado, arugula and tomato
Plus a Prime Rib steak that melts in your mouth
This place has become one of my favorite restaurants
There are not many places that you can have a great meal accompanied by amazing jazz on a Friday or Saturday night
This place has so much to offer Park Slope
I feel comfortable going in by my self and hanging at the bar
The bartender is a true professional and makes the best bloody mary I have ever had
MUST TRY THIS PLACE
Magnolia is situated on a quiet residential street and it has neighborhood find written all over it
It almost lives up to its potential
Great ambiance -- and after three visits -- the food improves each time we dine
The specials are more adventerous than what you'll find on the menu too
No matter where we end up going on the weekends we always wind up at Magnolia for the live jazz
We love the regular menu but the late night menu fits the bill when you just want a little nibble
The beet and asparagus salad with gorgonzola is my favorite
I do however think the service could be a bit better, especially for brunch
Magnolia's such a terrific space that you really want the food to match the decor and vibe in quality
Unfortunately, food was slow to be served and not worth the wait - uninspired salads and confoundingly tasteless pork chops
What a shame
Had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and finally stopped in for bruch
Was surprised that such a nice spot had such a carelessly prepared plate with such off-hand service
I enjoy this place
I always have a good time here
The food is tasty and fresh, and that chocolate peanut butter dessert is fabulous
The wait staff is competent
Magnolia is a wonderful resturant
The have taken some of there cues from The Blue Ribbon on 5th, but they are all positive
Delicious drinks, great atmosphere and a delious, varied menu
Brunch is good too!
In Short This is a big, garden-variety sushi interior with a small, semi-circular sushi bar up front and big windows facing Hudson Street
Despite the suggestion of the name, the cuts of fish at Monster are no more massive than those at a handful of other popular sushi restaurants around town
For those who aren't in the mood for fish, there's a wealth of other items (127 savory dishes in all) to try
MONSTER - the name says it all; the pieces are huge (and fresh/tasty as well)! Overall, the food's quality is above-average, while reasonably priced
For lunch, walk in slightly after 1pm to avoid long lines
But, don't worry, the food comes pretty quickly, so you can get back to work on time
For dinner, it's usually pretty dead ('cos of its location), so you'll get a lot of personal attention
P
S
If you're a eel lover, definitely try the Monster Roll (it's one of a kind in NYC)
The worst EVER! I tried the 23rd St location twice
bad fish first and the second time I chose to have it delivered
NEVER showed, called 3 times
2 hours later
no sushi for me! Never again!
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh
Portions are not monster-sized -- the name of the restaurant could be misleading
Service is prompt
Good for a quick sushi lunch
I read about monster sushi here on citysearch and I am so glad I tried it
It was the best sushi I've had in New York
It was very moderately priced and a perfect place to eat for lunch
It has a very extensive menu and everything looked great
I highly recommend this place!
The portions are enormous, The quality is excellent and the price is middle of the road
Making this one of the best Sushi values in the city
The satff is friendly and effecient
Not the most romantic place in town but what Sushi resteraunt is
Yhis is a GREAT place
I forgot what really good sushi tasted liked
I usually go to 23rd street location, but ate here instead and food was just as good
No customers really b/c in the heart of midtown, but can't go wrong with anything here! You really get double for your $$
One roll came with 12 pieces
For 4 people
80 bucks
A bit cheaper than Haru and quality much better!
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious! Very good service and very good prices
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service
Killer Sushi!

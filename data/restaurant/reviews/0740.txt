Nestled among the bodegas and 99 stores is this Washington Heights pearl
The wait staff is polite to a fault, patiently taking time to describe the menu items and specials in detail
The food is wonderful and in generous portions, the appetizers are fun and tasty, the specialty cocktails are unique and delicious and the wine list is fine
The prices are very reasonable, and dessert was a sin
Try it out, it's worth the trip!
I have to vistit this place again as their are so many other dishes on the menu I would like to try
I went with a party of five and every one there loved this place
The appetizers were great and had a wide diversity of options
Some one in my party orderd the land and sea mixed girll combination and it could feed up to 3 people
Filled with Steak, Chicken, Lobster, Pernil, Chorizo Sausage, Shrimps, and Octopus
This restaurant would be an excellent date spot
The drink options were great, you have to order a mango colada and the service was also incredible
I recently went here for my cousins Birthday
The Food was excellent
They manage to serve some very creative Latin cuisine while still offering tradition Latin favorites
The list of exotic tropical drinks was quite interesting, Many using fresh juices and herbs
They offer several twists on the Traditional Cuban Mojito
The space is beautifully decorated, And did I mention there is a night club upstairs?
I happened to go to Republi'k this past Saturday for a second time and really enjoyed myself
I first had dinner with a large group of friends before heading upstairs for some dancing
The food was excellent and the service was prompt considering the size of our group
Also had a good time upstairs, were it really gets going after 1am
I recommend it to all
The place is very sexy! It is a great date resteraunt! The food is absolutely fabulous! The bathroom is gorgeous!
I recently celebrated my birthday at DRK
My friends and I had a late dinner (the fish was amazing!) and then headed upstairs for a night of latin dancing
The DJ is very good, he mixes sets of Salsa, Merengue, Hip-Hop and Rock en EspaNol
The crowd is not the typical downtown crowd, mostly latinos who really know how to dance and have fun
I would recommend it to anybody who wants to have an authentic latin night in Manhattan
Everything was perfect
Prompt seating, courteous service, and the food was delicious
I had the Paella and it was amazing
Just steps away from the 1 or 9 train on Dykeman Avenue, Republi-k is a diamond in the rough
It's Pan-Latino food delivers a gourmet feast at Washington Heights prices
Killer sangria; generous seafood portions in the delicious seafood bisque; delicious mixed grill sampler for two could feed a small army
Don't forget to visit the Tony Montana-esque nightclub above the restaurant
The Scene During peak hours, this Smith Street restaurant draws a full house
Its kitschy interior is crowded with random wall hangings; there's even a moped in the dining room
The upbeat, loungey music sets the tone for the stylish crowd that soaks up the fast-paced bistro atmosphere into the wee hours
Service often leans toward apathy
The Food The French-ified menu's simplest dishes, like juicy burgers and moules frites, work best
The crisped fries, wrapped in paper and served with mayonnaise, are perfect for dunking into the mussels' pleasant white wine broth
Entrees can be inconsistent: The tender pork filet mignon arrives with sweet roasted apples, but sits atop a tasteless bed of spinach and next to bland whipped potatoes
Skip the tiny "bistro bites"; the flourless chocolate cake, daily tart and creme caramel will satisfy your sweet craving
I heard this place was great! I think I read the review on Scoutsider's review of Top5 French Restaurants in New York City! (I think you can get to their site by Googling it)
I was surprised to see a lot of negative comments
I've been to this place twice for lunch, both times during the week and had a very pleasant time
Yes the service was slow and not super friendly was they were not rude either
Maybe because it was not as crowded
The attitude and service is very French though, not what us New Yorkers are used to
So just lower your expectations and go enjoy great food and a very nice wine selection
Totally recommend their oyster special
I went to Bar Tabac for brunch with a friend today and and we stood at the entrance discussing with each other whether we would rather sit inside or outside
There were a couple of tables free outside and many free inside, and the place generally didn't seem as busy as it sometimes does
The host approached us, and before we had a chance to say anything to him he reprimanded us for talking to each other instead of him, and he started walking away, saying that he was the keymaster and if we wanted a table we had to talk to him not each other
This interaction literally lasted less than a few seconds, we really didn't have a chance to address him before he became rude and walked away
We turned right around and left and had a pleasant brunch at the newish Italian place further south on Smith whose name escapes me right now
I live nearby and usually go to Bar Tabac once every 3 or 4 weeks, but after today I doubt I will be going back
After being seated outside by the host, a waitress came over and yelled at us for taking a table that belonged to people waiting at the bar
then after standing up we were left there for 10 minutes while the host and waitress chatted 10 feet away
after decided to leave, they were overheard saying oh look now they're leaving and giggling
it's a shame the food is ok, because i'll never go back
Went with a group of 5 and had an amazing time
The food was sublime and the service was attentive and informed
The waiter knew his menu and what to recommend
The tab wasn't bad either for what we got -- wine, appetizers, entrees and a few shared desserts (plus tip) came out to about $50 each
Highly, highly recommended
Well worth a trip from Manhattan
I have only been here a few times and it wasn't till the last that we discovered the ridiculous service that I just read about in 5 other reviews
We ordered essentially at the same time the couple next to us did yet we got our food after they were literally finishing their meal
so there was about a 15 minute time difference
At one point I looked at the waiter and shrugged
I think he was just used to it
didn't seem surprised
My gf ordered a diet coke when we were starting to finally eat and got it as our bill came
The jazz is great
I suggest sitting up front I don't think they forget you up there as easily
I'm surprise for the number of people who had a bad experience
I've been there a lot and I always have a good time and good food
I have to say that I've been there only during brunch time but the service even though slow, it was good
Try the madame croquette!!mmmmm
This review is not designed to criticize the food, which was in fact quite good
I recently ate Brunch there and was dismayed and dissapointed by the service
After we finished eating ourentrees, we asked the waiter to order cappucinos
He responded with, I must ask my manger The restaurant was indeed busy and full, but this was a reaction I had never heard in years of avid brunch-dining and working in various restaurants
We summoned the manager, quite a rarity for both me and my companion
The manager responded without an ounce of empathy or regret, but rather frank rudeness and an explanation that he found absolutely nothing wrong with being the arbiter of approving or not allowing post-brunch coffee to be ordered
We also witnessed the waitstaff and manager react rudely to an adjacent table as they were awaiting one of the members of their party to arrive
Despite a wonderful atmosphere with live jazz and delicious food the waitstaff and manager are rude and unpleasant - I will never return
I ate here this past weekend and after eating a delicious brunch with my cousin, requested an after-meal cappuccino
The waiter said I'm not sure, I need to ask the manager because there are people waiting for your table
I then requested to speak with the manager who proceeded to defend (rudely) his waitstaff's statement and repeated the claim that there were people waiting for the table
He did not apologize or offer us our drinks and walked away
We were not slow to eat our meal and this response was totally unreasonable
I said to the manager, If you do not have time to serve us a full meal then do not seat us! Note: the parties to our left and right experienced similar problems
I love this place
I have only had a few things on the menu, but only because they have been so good that I haven't felt the need to stray
The burger is tops, the mussles in dijonaise sauce are delicious, and the steak is grand
Not to mentin the fries! And I love that they have hoegaarden on tap
It's a lovely little place that can often get crowded, so I recommend going at an off hour

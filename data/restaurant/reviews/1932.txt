So after more apologies and the manager coming over, we finally ate
Thankfully we didn't have to pay for their mistakes and got some stuff on the house
The thing is that when they tell you that you have a time limit they should be able to expedite your food with plenty of time for you to enjoy it without feeling like you have to beat the clock
Especially when you're paying that kind of money
Maybe it was just a bad night, i would definitely go again
Oh yeah, try the Black Cod with Miso - WOW
Although Nobu requires a 2-3 month advanced reservations, it's worth the wait! My stomach is very sensitive to japanese food and I can only eat sushi but at nobu, I tasted everything we ordered and I loved it! My stomach had no complaint! The Broiled Black Cod with Miso was our favorite! We had to order two after we tried the first one
The Kobe beef was also quite delicious
If it's your first time going, be sure to ask your waiter/waitress what they recommend!
I've eaten at Nobu three times- got in all three times because the person I was with was either a regular or knew the manager
I would not want to try to get into this place on my own! The first two times were delicious but I definitely noticed a decline in the quality the last time
I love the space and the food is top-notch, but I'm not sure it's worth the hype anymore, especially when you see the prices
I reccomend Blue Ribbon Sushi, even though it has gone down in quality as well
I'm Japanese born in Japan, spending 20yrs living in the States
I love fine dining in NYC
I've been to almost every hottest restaurants
To my regret, Nobu was a big dissapointment
First of all
well, most important of all, the food was not that great
As a matter of fact, the food I ordered was below average in my standard
My two other Japanese friends who dined with me shared the same opinion
It was not worth it
We won't go back there again
There are many other good Japanese restaurants costing less money
Creativity variety of the menu (including catering to vegetarians/mothers to be) allows my group to try many things
If you sit at the sushi bar you may have the pleasure of a massage (me my companions have never been so relaxed or so 'nobu'!!) but you have to be a regular!! We think the waitresses just want a bigger tip
Hey, it doesn't fool me
I always leave 15% tip
When I had to call two weeks in advance to get a table i was thinking man I'm breaking the bank on this meal
Boy was I wrong the meals are very normally priced
and the dishes Are AMAZING!!!  We had the tasting menu (i dont like spicy dishs -- but my girlfriend loves them) they did one sampler for her and one for me
and it couldnt have gotten better
The miso Black cod has a taste just like seabass (actually if you put me in a blind taste test I wouldnt be able to tell the difference) The shrimp tempura was out of this world
I couldnt ask for anything more
we had one bamboo of sake and then switched it up to hot sake
they have a fine selection with a great taste and bite
After visiting Nobu in London 2 years ago, I was pretty much hooked on the whole Nobu dining experience
The food is out of this world with its freshness, originality and fantastic taste-bud sensation! I was not disaapointed when I visited Nobu in NY in June 2004, and I am certainly going back again next year when I visit NY again
I'd eaten here 2 years before and remembered it as an amazing experience
This weekend, returning again, it was a happy surprise that nothing had changed: with each dish (from tender kobe beef, the famed miso cod, and rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce
to the melt-in-your-mouth-fresh slices of sashimi and finally the indescribable array of desserts), our entire table could have sworn we had died and gone to heaven
Our waitress was friendly, unintimidating, and knew the menu like a proud parent knows her child
Words cannot describe! Nobu is more than fine dining: it's an event, and every bit in step with its reputation
I guess I expected more after hearing about the place forever
The waiter was very snobby and was disinterested in what we wanted
He was happier with the couple next to us who looked up to him like lost puppies and ordered everything he told them to and in his order
The food was mediocre, the sushi and tempura I order from my local delivery place is better
Nobu is like a once famous starlet who is swiftly fading
We heard about Nobu for the longest time before we moved to NY
The overall experience was average
We had the $100 tasting menu
Compare with other tasting menus we had, it was not very creative or surprising
The dessert was the most disappointing with s'more
For a $100 tasting menu, we expected a better finish
For a Japanese restaurant, the black cod and lobster tempera were great
However, the ending sushi plate was not the best quality sushi
For the price we paid, we could have better Japanese food and sushi
The restaurant decor was a mix between Japanese causal restaurant style and trendy
Very loud for causal japanese dinning, not romantic enough for a date (but a date can pay for the meal)
I've heard many mixed reviews about Nobu and I had to see for myself
Called i month in advance just to make sure I get a Saturday 9pm reservation, it took 10 min to get thru
Only had to wait 5 minutes for our table - downside was the waiting area is non-existent since your standing in the doorway
Waiter extremely friendly and had great suggestions which were to die for: yellow tail, rock shrimp and the kobe beef, which looked small, but actually filled us up
Then we ordered our own rolls
This place has exposed me to the best and the quality of everyhting was exceptional, how can I ever eat at regular sushi joints again
Can't wait to go back
Eating at Nobu was one of the most delicious experiencies in my life
I used to travel a lot and it was not easy to find a reservation at the restaurant, but we went there, wait and we had the great opportunity to have seat at the sushi bar, and it was superb, waiting was worthly!!
The food was excellent but please there are other really good restaurants out there! It was kind of boring, no music, not much atmosphere
They say the waiting list is months long we went on a Saturday night and there were 4 large tables empty at 9pm
Why is that? They make you think you cant get in and you can
While we were eating, a couple walked in with no reservations and were told to wait 45 minutes for a table and they were seated in less time
They definately sugarcoat this restaurant
The service was good, nice waiters
I would go back if I could get a reservation or maybe I will simply walk in off the street!!
Unlike the London Nobu, this restaurant in NYC likes to keep making reservations impossible
After all that, it is average food at best with huge bill at the end
I think that there are far better Japanese restaurants in NYC (both authentic and Noveau)
Certainly will not be back
I've been here several times and it has been consistently phenomenal food
The yellowtail sahsimi with jalapenos has to be my favorite dish ever! The most recent time I was there I was celebrating an anniversary and unfortunately, it was a very unpleasant experience
The service that night was incredibly inattentive and almost rude
Understandibly, this is one of New York's hottest restaurants, but if I'm going to spend this much money on dinner, the quality of service should match the food
A very trendy Japanese restaurant
that's for sure
Super-tough to get reservations
The food was definitely good
the first time I went
I ordered the $99 prix fixe multi course chef's choice
Truly outstanding
The next time I went I decided to get fancy and ordered the $125 chef's choice
Very disappointing
Maybe it' s me, but some of the more exotic fish just were not very appetizing
The regular menu looked fine to me
not overly pricey
I found it good enough the first time to want to go back, but after the second time, I think I've had my fill of Nobu
I would, however, recommend it, it is an enjoyable experience all around
The wait staff was incredibly helpful
explaining every course of the prix fixe as it came out
That was much appreciated

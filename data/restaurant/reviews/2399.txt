Not that authentic for Thai food
This has been a longtime favorite for me, my family, and friends
I always enjoy a warm welcome, and love both the evocative French-country atmosphere and the traditional dishes
The addition of small plates to the menu has been especially helpful when I'm trying to watch my waistline! A secret suggestion: ask if they have the cocotte for dessert, even if it's not on the menu
You'll thank me if they have it!
It was a 90 degree day and I had walked from Port Authority on my way to a hair appointment- I stepped through the door and Voila! I was transported back to Provence in an instant! Wonderful prix fixe $23 lunch- started with caramelized onion tart followed by cold poached salmon over a bed of julienned cucumbers with a great vinaigrette then ended with two small scoops of decadent chocolate mousse on a sauce of mocha
With a generous pour of house Cotes du Rhone it was perfection!
Wonderful dishes: Their escargot in a pastry shell is my favorite escargot dish in all of NYC and Paris! My fiance is in love with their fresh bread w/ anchovie sauce (It sounds strange, I know
but sooo good!) The provencale style fish soup is interesting and flavorful
And the duck breast in pear sauce is just delicious
However, the provencale style mussels were disappointing
For dessert: The lavendar creme brulee is delightful and interesting
The molten chocolate dessert is to die for!  Wonderful service decor: On top of all the great tasting dishes, the service is just wonderful and the atmosphere is so charming and quaint!
If you ever wanted to escape the city and drown in a world steeped in culture, civility, and genuineness, La Mangeoire is a feast for the soul
With such superba dn authentic decor, immediately one is taken aback by the warmth and charm of the ambiance and the staff
With a myriad of options ranging from food selection to half plates, the sizable menu was not overwhelming, though disheartening: I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO CHOOSE BECAUSE EVERYTHING SOUNDED AMAZING
The appetizers were not overfilling, introducing the tongue to the French flavors yet to come
The cranberry sorbet, also a welcome treat to end the meal on
Everything from portion size, to knowledgable waitstaff, to cheery owner, to dim lighting make for a peaceful and engaging meal your stomach and tastebuds will never forget
BONNE SOIR!
I am a young professional who found this local staple to be nothing less than perfect
The old world style, inviting atmosphere and regional cuisine fit a budget and was much more practical than taking a trip to Riviera
Their sidealk dining area, lined with colorful planter boxes, was much more private and cozy than most sidewalk dining you find on NYC streets
I cant wait to come back here with frinds and family
I don't mind spending money on a nice meal, but this was the most insulting overpriced, tasteless meal I've ever had
The glorified half plate sounds like a nice option but is a complete joke
When they mean baby lamb chops, they mean miniscule and fatty, but don't worry you get 2 of them for $20

Quality is not based on quantity but this was terrible
Shrimps were extremely fishy, Vegetables and potatoes were tasteless additions
Some friends had recommended this restaurant
I went there for dinner with my husband and was enchanted by the decor
I recently gave a bridal shower for my niece and every body raved about the food and the service
The maitre d' was also very helpfull and charming
Has become one of my favorite French bistro
My husband and I went to La Mangeoire after a friend recommended it
It's a cozy place with a warm feeling and nice simple decoration
-It was Valentine's day and the place was packed
We didn't have to wait to be seated, but as the night went by, other couples waited by the entrance
The food was good, the holiday menu was delicious
We really enjoyed each course
Well, the service
it's hard to evaluate considering that it was an atypical day, but my husband and I had to catch the waiters to get another glass of wine
Friendly staff when in contact
this is a wonderful little french restaurant
service is excellent
the food is always reliable and beautifully presented
the rooms are pretty and have a french country home feel
the prix fixe brunch is an excellent value - had several cups of coffee at no extra charge
leave room for dessert!
I've eaten at La Mangeoire twice and found it be very good food both times
Most recently I tried the peppercorn steak with mashed potatoes and garlic spinach
The steak was cooked to perfection and the various flavors complemented each other nicely
The atmosphere is intimate and authentic
It is a bit pricey, but I think it's worth the expenditure
Another winning attribute of La Mangeoire: it's a nice change of pace in an area dominated by indistinguishable irish pubs and lame after work bar and grills
The downtown location is in the middle of all the questionable touristy chinatown restaurants, but it is the real thing
Yes, the space is not quite attractive and yes, you often need to wait for a while to be seated
Also, you might be surrounded by a giant group from a bus tour, as were last week
All of this is completely worth it because of the perfect food
The duck is superb and comes with all the necessary sides; we figured out that if you order a couple of vegetable and noodle dishes, you'd want 1 duck for 3 people or 4 slightly less hungry ones
Try the green beans with pork and the thick noodles with pork as additional dishes
Skip the cheap house wines and stick with the tea and TsingTao beer
You cannot beat the quality of the Peking Duck served here - the name says it all
The decor is minimalist but you cannot be the quality of the food and the service is very attentive
Great for a large group
If you enjoy Chinese cuisine you can't go wrong at this restaurant
A perfect place for dining in larger groups where sharing an array of various dishes makes things easy enjoyable
Everything ordered was tasty and the Peking duck was perfect
The restaurant was surprisingly quiet
Decor is basic, service just fine but food is well worth every penny! Go!
If you are a fan of Pecking Duck, then you will absolutely LOVE this restaurant
The duck is one of the best I have ever had!
First time come to this restaurant
I was so impressed
Never found any Chinese restaurant that serves such delicious food and excellent service
The special decoration provides a great atmosphere for me to eat there
I will definitely come back again
Delicious food, Wonderful service
New renovations makes the perfect ambience
Must try!
The Best Duck in Midtown, Great Service but the decor needs an uplift
Wait staff knows their business, Peking Duck is carved at your table
The very best Peking Duck in Mid-Town Manhattan
If you are looking for a convenient and delicious Chinese feast anywhere north of canal street this restaurant is a terrific choice
A friend and I went last week because she wanted paella-turned out to be very bland and there is $5 sharing charge but you don't get more food-just a plate
It must be to cover what they think is a loss if two people come and share an entree, which is totally overpriced
We had chicken in hot garlic sauce (doesn't come with rice-it's a choice of overcooked bland veggies or overcooked bland rice), stuffed mushrooms (slightly buttery which had the most taste of all the food we had) and codfish espanadas-GROSS
Service was ok, prices were waaaay too high for that level of food
You're better going off to Cabana! The only good thing to say about it-the strawberry mojitos were decent!

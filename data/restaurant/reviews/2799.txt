The only thing is their meat is all pork
I wish they had a substitute for the pork but other than that
I love this place =)~
Having had Thai Food all over the country, I can truly say that this is the best thai food around
Not the best ambience and the service is sometimes just mediocre, but the quality of the food is incredible
If you want EXCELLENT Thai food, this is the place
Maybe not appropriate for a first date or something, but extremely appropriate for well cooked Thai food
Authentic to a T(hai)!
I eat here weekly! It's the best
so much to love, I usually order two lunch specials (which, at like $5 each, are a great deal)
The tofu soup is amazing
Beef Pad Khing practically makes me drool
Where is the 11 key on this rating thing!
The roasted chicken is superb
Moist and very flavorful
The beef + potatoes dish is terrific
The sauce with the beef is delicious
I always judge a good peruvian restaurant based on the dish 'aji de gallina', if they serve it, and this one definitly passes the test! They also have some other great typical dishes such as 'tacu tacu' and 'causas'
They also have some of the best 'tostones' I have ever eaten, even though they're not typically peruvian
Also try their 'Sangria', it's also really well done
If you are looking for the best Colombian food, look no further
La Boina Roja is the place to eat
Their food is very traditional and authentic and their steaks are magnificent
The service is great and you are treated very well; as a friend
Besides the great food and service, the menu is inexpensive; within everyone's budget
Unfortunately this makes the restaurant crowded and sometimes you have to wait long for a table
But the food and service make up for the wait
This is one of the best Italian Restaurants in Queens if not NYC
Don't let the decor fool you because you will miss out in some of the best food you ever eaten
The service is great, the food is wonderful and the portions are humongous
The Owner comes around to check if everything is OK and offers free drinks, desert and coffee
If something isn't on the menu don't be afraid to ask, the majority of time they will make it for you
The portions are so humoungous be prepared to bring a doggy bag home with you
Don't let the old-fashioned interior and exterior of Luigi's fool you - this place serves the highest quality Italian I've had in a long time
The extremely friendly service is a plus, but the food speaks for itself
I'm not sure who she is, but there is an elderly woman who comes around from time to time to ask you how you are enjoying your meal - she may be the head cook, and if she is, she's a genius! Live accordian music on saturdays completes the experience
I have to ditto all of the posts here
This is truly the Gem of Jackson Heights
I went for the first time 2 weeks ago and returned the next week
It will be a regular for me! The green sauce and that salad
to die for!!!
This is one of my favorite places in the city
The menu is simple and the bright decor and latin music are absolutely great
The wait staff is amongst the friendliest in the city
You must have the sangria
Unfortunatey, It can become very busy, so the earlier the better
This place is usually hit or miss
The chicken is a sure-fire hit, but their fish can be underpar
I highly suggest you make reservations, as wait times can be extremely long
This restaurant is always crowded, unless you go at 11pm, when they are ushering people out, but will definitely let you in
It has a lively atmosphere, but if you are used to being waited hand anf foot, avoid this place
because of the high level of volume of people coming in, it can take a long time before the waiter will come over to you
It also helps if you speak a little Spanish since the waiters aren't usually english-proficient
For the price, this place can not be beat
A total gem! Pio Pio is the kind of restaurant I adore introducing to friends, family, everyone! I'm there normally once a week (though somtimes more) because I just can't go more than a few days without that sauce
Chicken is perfection, maduros are sensational and the cebiche is stand-out
Do yourself a favor and order it spicy
I've never had it any other way and can't imagine bothering
But watch out for the sangria, it's dangerous, as are the waiters who insist upon pouring it for you
Terrific food!! This place is just great!!! You are always welcome, whether all dressed up, or in Jeans and a t-shirt!! The waitors, although their English is not the best, are very friendly and attentive! This is a great place to bring a date
This is an even better place to go with a group of friends and see gorgeous (trust me)South American Women !!! One after the next, i swear i needed a chiropractor after eating at this place from turning my head so much!!!! The weekends are the best(Fri, Sat, Sun)
Enjoy it fellas and couples alike!!!!
I have to admit, this is one of the best chicken in town
The food is great, the waiters are polite if you are not peruvian ofcourse
Well I think the price is way high considering this is a place where chicken is made
I don't think a whole chicken with salad and potatoe is worth $30 +
This place is fabulous! The portions are massive, the food is perfect, and the vibe is jovial and friendly
Great food, great decor, wonderful service, oh, did I mention great food!!!
Pio Pio has gone a long way from its beginings some years ago
I went with a small party to the Pio Pio at Northern Blvd
The menu was still small, but the quality of food that came out of the kitchen was superb, and the service was not bad at all
The place gives you the effect of being in a exotic place in South-America, but the food fools you in beliving that you are in heaven
The Scene Trying to place your order at this bustling 24-hour street food joint can be like entering the holiday shopping fray
But don't be alarmed: The disorganized frenzy at this neighborhood fave is a long-standing tradition
You'll see crowds that reflect the diversity of the surrounding Jackson Heights neighborhood, with people cutting lines and barking out orders at the food counter staff
Cheap furniture and fluorescent lighting make for spartan decor; pull up a plastic chair and dive into the hungry chaos
The Food Kebab King is famous for its savory meats, and two favorites seem to disappear the quickest: chicken makhani, tender dark meat in a decadently rich, creamy, chili oil gravy, and the chicken tikka platter, a generous serving of juicy, smoke-charred chicken nestled into biryani rice with whole peppercorns
Sandwich your bites between torn pieces of fluffy, oven-baked naan bread; finish with fragrant homemade marsala chai and milky, pistachio-drizzled sweets
Kabab King is the best in taste for South Asian food, not just Pakistani
What you order will determine your experience at Kabab King
Chicken Tikkas the norm at all restaurants, you must try Kabab King's specials Chicken Bihari and Beef Bihari Kababs
Don't forget the naan with them
The service and atmosphere may not set your mood but when you're done you will realize that it's only the food that counts! Take notes from here and you won't be disappointed!
Jackson Heights, Queens, really is like a bazaar in South Asia - the smells, the sounds, the FOOD! And to that end, there is nothing quite like Kebab King Palace (same owner as Kebabk King diner)
The food is authentic and VERY spicy but GOOD
The chicken tikkas are a must
While I can't say much for ambience (it's quite shabby and you get plastic tableware) that sort of adds to the whole 'mood'
Best of all, its CHEAP
Service depends on the server
I personally like the take out
Its also fun to watch the peole in the back make the tikkas and the naans
The owners are very hospitable and its great when they're around to serve you
Jackson Diner down the street may look nicer but Kabab King Palace is where its at!
I have been going to this restaurant for years and the taste of the food is always consistent
The fries aren't greasy and the stuffed filet of sole is like no other
My dad loves to go there for the lobster, which is also great!
I truly had a wonderful time!! The food was fantastic, the prices were very reasonable, and yeah, the manager was a looker and so was Alejandro, the waiter
Very attentive, that's for sure
A very pleasant esperience over all!!
La Portena has been getting some good press and the buzz grows

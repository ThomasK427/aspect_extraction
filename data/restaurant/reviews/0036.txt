Don't be fooled by cheap imitations elsewhere
This pizza is the real thing
Great wine, an elegant atmosphere, and an authentic slice of Naples make for a wonderful dining experience
Pizza Fresca makes what is a certified neapolitan pizza
For those of you who have never had the luck to taste real neapolitan pizza (which you basically can't find in NY), it has indeed a distinctive sogginess to it
That means it's a bit softer and more chewier
It is different from thin crust pizza
So, for all of you who complained about the sogginess, I am sorry but that's what Neapolitan pizza is all about (and also being a bit burnt on the side, in case you hate that as well, be aware)
This said, I think Pizza Fresca comes pretty close to Neapolitan Pizza, not 100 % original but a very good imitation
And the place is very nice and the service is excellent
they might become a bit rude I guess when they have customers expecting Pizza Hut stuff
nice restaurant with good solid italian food
lots of different pastas and brickoven pizza to try
got a nice glass of house barbera which worked great
the calamari was ok
it's huge, you can totally share with a couple of friends
pastas seemed really rich
i prefered the pizza
mine was with prosciutto
service was low
there seemed to only be 2 waiters who seemed indifferent and a bunch of busboys running around performing waiter duties
i'd go again if i was in the neighborhood but for the money i think there are better places such as otto enoteca or l'ulivo
The authentic food, awesome wine list and friendly service made my experience enjoyable at this cozy Italian restaurant
HAd a pleasant experience at fresca, the food , service, atmosphere - all enjoyable
My only complaint is that because of the cheese used - Buffalo Mozarella - and it's high water content makes for soggy pizza
so the longer the pizza sits on your plate the soggier it will get -so eat it quick
Otherwise ingredients were very fresh and yummy, it's still one of my favorite italian spots!
The brick oven pizza was excellent
The margarita pizza was delicious-- it was served pipping hot! Yum! I agree that the service was rude and slow
I understand the old world charm in leaving the patrons alone to enjoy a relaxed meal, but the wait was ridiculous
I thought I was dreaming when i tasted the pizza Margherita
We were impressed with the fresh ingredients and the delicious sauce
The prices were affordable and the portions were generous
The only down side was the poor and disappointing service
This little nook is truly a gem
Upon walking in and noticing the exposed red brick wall and the white tableclothes and and huge rack of various wines behind the bar, I felt like I was in a truly authentic Italian restaurant
The house chianti, salmon appetizer and tortellini with a delicious red sauce were all excellent
Prices were reasonable too
In Short The Metro Hotel's roof garden has been well designed, with sturdy decking and comfortable all-weather furniture
Wildflower boxes and pruned hibiscus bushes soften the effect and provide a pleasing contrast to the midtown roofscape
The seating area is comfortably large, providing room to spread out and minimizing any disturbances from adjacent tables
The menu features grilled meat, poultry and fish as well as several pastas, appetizers and salads, plus beer, wine and cocktails
Perfect for that after-work drink the Rooftop Bar of the Hotel Metro gets crowded with Midtown white collars looking for a drink before heading home
Never had the food so cannot comment
However, great place to people watch, catch a drink and maybe meet someone
The crowd is young with plenty of people in their twenties to early thirties
Tip: There are only 2 bathrooms so make those bathroom trips count as you're likely to wait forever if you need to go again
In Short Bright Tuscan colors adorn this cavernous space on the ground floor of the Met Life building
The open kitchen's wood oven bakes pizzas in a range of styles: Pizza Pugliese, with pancetta and onions; picante, with spicy chicken sausage; and insalata, with romaine lettuce, join more conventional choices, like margherita, quattro formaggi and mushroom
Pasta dishes, sandwiches and a host of meat and fish entrees round out the menu
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant
Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC
Would definitely go back again
The pizza here is delicious
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY
They have some great entrees here as well
Service is great, takeout is good too
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central
I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice
I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer
Both are delicious, the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night
I just got back from eating at some of Naples' most famous pizzerias, and I gotta say, that this pizza is the closest I'll ever come to eating it in New York
The crust is pillow soft, a touch of salt, just perfectly charred on the bottom and edges, not too much cheese, vibrant tomato flavor
i want one now!!! I've been there with parties of 10, and parties of 2, and each time the service has been fantastic
Great pizza for lunch place
Service was quick
The pizza was great
And it was quick which is very important
Have the iced tea
It was wonderful
I was there on a Wednesday evening (6:30PM) for a dinner for two
My friend has eaten here before and suggested we order multiple appetizers and share them instead of ordering the entrees
It turned out to be a great suggestion because all the appetizers we got were decently portioned and delicious
The restaurant was only half full when we were there so the wait staff was very attentive
We went for the free Italian wine tasting event they have every Thursday in August and it was fantastic
The wine was wonderful and the pizza (which was free) was even better than the wine
They never ran out of either despite the growing crowd young professionals
The clientele at the restaurant was a bit older and more sophisticated, which is understable considering it's Park Avenue location and higher than average menu prices
I will definitely come back to sample the regular menu though, I was impressed
I have attended Naples 45 more than once, sampling both the pizza and the pasta
Both are excellent
This place is a great value - for the same money you would spend at a lesser place, you get a really memorable meal with quality ingredients
Both the service and the decor and top-notch
Great drinks, too - try the bellini!!!
Great for sandwiches, pizza, pasta, soups, and salads
just about anything on the menu
Its a great place to come with a group and get a tasting sample of a few different dishes, some of the unique dishes I loved was the Boucatini with an egg and parmesan sauce with fresh black pepper, the grilled chicken panini, roasted eggplant parm
The service was decent, but the place gets packed-fast!! Also great during the summer with the outside dining
But was not crazy about the pizza parlour booths we were seated in
I've eaten here a number of times
the pizza is absolutely delicious
The entrees are tasty
but the portions are pretty small compared to other Italian restaurants
What I don't like is the service
The restaurant is quite large
and has lots of seating
yet I always feel rushed
You can never just relax and have a leisurely meal

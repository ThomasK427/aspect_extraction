The apps were very tasteful but the entrees were poor at best
I had the lamb
There couldnt have been more than 2 ounces on my plate accompanied with jimmy dean sausage of sorts
I am a small person so I dont require a lot of food but this was ridiculous
Our entrees also took over 40 minutes with no apology from anyone
We saw other tables looking around too
We decided to skip dessert b/c we were so annoyed and she dropped the check with our entree plates still on the table
HORRENDOUS!!!
I love this place
Everytime i go, i leave happier than the time before
The food is delicious and different
I recently went on a first date and had some of the best serivce i have had in a long time in new york
Friendly, intelligent (and very good looking staff)!!! this is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in new york
Unfortunately the restaurant was much better than my date
At least i loved the food and service, my boring date couldnt ruin that! lol
I always have a good time at Public
the staff knows how to treat guests and the food is delicious!
Since Public opened 2 years ago, I have been a regular customer; I just can't help but return time and time again
The food is fantastic albeit bizzare (I took a chance on the grilled porkbelly with purple potato salad, yes that is really on the menu, and it was absolutely delicious)
The servers are knowledgeable and enthusiastic and when provoked, even willing to poke fun at the sometimes outrageous ingredients featured in some dishes
My favorites are the succulent grilled scallops (with the Gewurtzraminer by the glass!), white anchovies that melt in your mouth, and the fantastic New Zealand venison; one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had
For dessert, get the sinful warm toffee pudding
The bar can get pretty loud and crowded on the weekends but sometimes that just adds to the restaurant's appeal
You can tell they take their food and fun very seriously!
I have never been for such a delightful meal in my life
This place felt like home, so kind with such amazing and unique food
I tasted things I have never experienced before and the wine was also great
Nice recommendation from our server
Beautiful people too, but not too pretentious
Overall, highly recommended!
Public is a pretty unique setting, but a cool one at that, and with excellent service
Having said that, the food is very average at best, portions are terribly small ( we went for pizza after the main course + appetizer), and it's pricey
What saved the night? The hostess was great (seated us even though we were an hour late), our waitress was nice (came by all the time), and the wine was good
Of course, I have plenty of nice friends, and I'm quite certain I could purchase the wine myself, so there's really no reason to go back
if you are upto trying new things then this is the place for you! i truly enjoyed public along with 6 other friends
first we sat at the bar for a drink of lychee mojito (a must) then we were seated promptly
all throughout the night it was perfect
i loved the duck entree
delectable!
Try the pomegrante mojito! Take a bar of soap with the restaurant details
Sit all the way in the back overlooking the fireplace
This place is chic, yet not pretentious, with the exception of the hosts at the door and the coatroom
Menu is excellent and original
Service is impeccable and attentive
Good for a romantic date, a few friends getting together, or for showing tourists around to the glamour and beauty of NYC
Unique neighborhood and an unforgettable experience for the public
our server was attentive and very friendly -- that was the best part of the experience
check out the cocktail menu - it's innovative and fun
down side: the food, while tasty, comes in TINY portions and is way overpriced
if i were to return, i'd probably just sit at the bar for a few drinks
Twice in a short period of time we came to Public for brunch at 3:10 to hear I am sorry, the kitchen is already closed
Their brunch hours are posted as 11:00-4:00 everywhere
We think that its simply disrespectful towards the customers to keep advertising certain hours but just close the kitchen whenever they feel like it
Keep this in mind before you go all the way over
I took my girlfriend here for dinner
The entrance was hard to find, but I'm glad we did
Inside we are greeted by very friendly hosts who promplty show you to your table
The main dining room is beautifully lit by candles which creates a very intimate atmosphere
The tables are a little too close together and you can hear everything the people next to you are talking about
Try not to sit next to two rednecks who feel cursing is an ancient mating call
Great place and I would definitely recommend it for dates
I've been coming here for years and each time it's been just as lovely
Whether you're there for the dining or simply for cocktails at the very attractive bar
it's a nice vibe and quite sensual to say the least
Stopped in on a Sunday night to find the place half-filled
had the chef's tasting menu - 5 courses for $45 (only available on Sundays)
unbelievable! A parsnip soup to start - so flavorful! Followed by one delicious course after another - ending with venison - wonderful
Service was professional and on point
Definately a must visit place for foodies
Had the foie gras as well - excellent
Our waitress said the regular chef wasn't there that night - I can't imagine it being any better, but can't wait to go back! Highly recommended!
Ambience, food and service-this place has it all! Public has such great atmosphere;open and airy with great lighting
The waitstaff was nice to the point that you forget you are in a trendy NYC restaurant-helpful and attentive
I have been twice so I know it wasn't just a fluke the first time
The food is really interesting (for true foodies!) amazing duck, the lentil salad is ridiculously good, as well as the watermelon and feta salad
They also have a great and reasonably priced wine list
I can't wait to try their brunch!
Have been to this place on a number of occasions for the bar atmosphere alone
The white peach margarita is incredible and the bar staff is great!
I wish they opened earlier than 6pm - happy hour would be awsome here!
I was recently taken to Public on a date and all I can say is that it was perfect
The food was excellent and the service was impeccable
I have never met nicer wait staff in my 5 years in Manhattan! Delicious Delicious Delicious!!!!
the hostess and bartender were both genuinely kind and provided interactive and fine service
The drink are pricey at $11 for a well mojito but they are very inventive and well made
I have to been to Public once a week for the last four weeks because different friends keep wanting to go and I have been happy to return! I am a big fan of the appetizers, all of them are great and I have tried most things on the menu
The fish is always out of this world too
I am less big on the venison but I also don't eat steak, so I must not be a red meat lover
The space is incredible and it somehow makes you feel really good with a mix of beautiful people and what look to be hard core foodies and British or Australian ex-pats
On Sat we did have to wait a bit for a table, but more like a typical NYC wait that is made shorter by having a drink in hand
In any case, the whole experience is highly recommended
When I first entered Public the Decor was amazing
Sleek clean look
We were promptly seated behind the bar
very noisy
Asked to be moved however we were still in the bar area
The menu was very limited and nothing seemed appetizing
Slow wait staff
the table consisted of a candle 2 glass of water
1 piece Bread came 10 minutes in

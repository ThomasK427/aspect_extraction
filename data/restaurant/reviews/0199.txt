In other reviews customers complained about their servers - I bet their servers complained about those customers too
Yes, the service was typically European in its leisure, but the servers were very attentive
The food was still delivered with the turn the table promptness, but was sooo good we were quickly distracted
Overall the experience was quite enjoyable
If you aren't in a hurry or pinching pennies, you'll love it
Have dined here a few times - better with small group/couple
Last experience was very disappointing - food was good but service slow and we were ignored (took an hour between salads entrees)
HINT - when ordering wine by glass ask to see bottle - wines can be changed when they run out
Artisanal is great place to get a great meal
The ambiance is perfect and not too loud
If you're a cheese lover this a cant miss
The tower of seafood, is definately too be had
You will be full after this meal
Although the price cna be a little steep
Hmmm
we went expecting to spend about $40 bucks a person, but it ended up closer to $70
The food was OK at best, and if you don't LOVE cheese don't even consider going here
I had the Lamb Shank, it was OK
The $7 New Castle ale's were great, but were only worth about $4
I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone, even cheese lovers
The smell can be sometimes annoying if you are not a cheese lover
We had a reservation for dinner during Restaurant Week
There were 5 of us
Initially, we felt rushed when the host told us we have to be seated immediately but it got better when the waitress came to take our orders
She was more laid back
We shared an order fondue du jour, which I thought was a tad on the pricey side ($22 for small)but very delicious
We also shared a bottle of wine ($25)
I ordered from the prix-fixe ($30
02) menu: boudin blanc with watercress salad, skirt steak with frites, and profiteroles with vanilla ice-cream
The food was definitely the highlight of the restaurant
The decor was nice and muted
The service was adequate for a Monday night dinner
The restaurant was probably 75% full the entire evening
Compared to Le Halles down the street, this is a winner
The fontina with truffle oil fondue is divine, far more pleasing than the traditional house blend
Service is pleasant, and offers good wine suggestions
The dining room is attractive, though it can be loud
The major downside is that you have to order all dipping items a la carte, which gets a bit pricey
Made reservations and still had to wait over 3/4 of an hour to be seated
The host kept saying, in a few mintutes, in a few minutes
FINALLY sat down and the menu was disappointing, but not as disappointing as our food (once it FINALLY arrived)
I know NY'ers can be impatient, but this place was SLOW! I wouldn't have minded if it the food was actually good
Even the cheese puffs (which got top ratings in NY magazine, left something to be desired
I went to Artisanal for a romantic date and was very happy with the result
First, I'll get the negative points out of the way
They seated me at a booth and date in a chair, which put him about a foot above me (I couldn't imagine eating comfortably at that height), but we asked to be moved to a regular table by the window--that improved things immensely
The waitstaff seemed a bit standoffish, but the interaction with them was limited so it didn't make too much difference
The food was excellent and the wine was also very good
I couldn't imagine a better Prix Fixe menu (I loved the pumpkin-mushroom risotto), and the sorbet! The atmosphere was very nice and romantic while I was there (about 6pm), though I've been by at later times and it seems a bit too loud/crowded
The problem with Artisinal is trying to save room for the cheese plate at the end of the meal
The food is wonderful -- great tuna carpaccio, fondue, rabbit,

everything
The cheese selection is awesome, but I think you can find a riper selection at some of the retail stores in the city
The wine list is fantastic, and there are hundreds of wines to order by the glass
The food was average
The cheese selection is exceptional and the table visit by the cheese 'master' was a nice touch
However, our waitress was a bit surly
When we ordered an appetizer to 'split', she responded that she couldn't physically cut it in half, seeming to intentionally misunderstand our request
As if she had never had customers share an appetizer! Her attitude put a damper on the evening, as did the stares from some servers when we took a peek into the cheese cellar
We went here for a romantic date - big dissapointment as the atmosphere is anything but romantic
We were craving fondue and were dissapointed with this as well
The portion was tiny, not even enough for the small amount of bread they gave
Vegetable crudite was extra and only had a few small dry veggies
We also ordered the salad nicoise which was supposedly the dinner portion
there were 3 small tuna pieces and some green beans with a bland dressing
To top it all off it was $100 for this snack Fondue has not been the same in NY since the demise of Roetelle (in the east village) and though artisanal is larger and brasher, it cannot compare
I will not be going back anytime soon
by the way if you have a fondue craving, try Mont Blanc on 48th street in the theatre district
The fondue was excellent, albeit quite pricey
Some of the entrees lacked that special quality that usually accompanies high prices
The wine and beer offerings were excellent
160 bottles of wine by the glass! An amazing assortment and not too pricey
The fondue is to die for!
Being French, a cheese lover since I can remember and now a New Yorker I had great expectations when making a reservation for my first fondue of the season
It turned out to be literally the WORST one I have ever had
Fondue is supposed to taste like cheese - not like a cornstarch paste soaked in kirsch
Furthermore, the service was pathetically slow in comparaison to similar bistros in the City
After dinner I walked over to the cheese counter -after having been greeted by a rude server, I was shocked to see how dissapointing their cheese selection was: it is miniscule, many of the fresh chevre cheese were more than ready to be tossed, etc
There is nothing artisanal about this restaurant
It is a true insult to the French and the extraordinary quality of cheese that they are capable of producing
Artisanal gets a big YUCK! The hostess and servers were rude and the food was awful
The fondue was OK, but the entrees leave a lot to be desired
All-in-all, I was disappointed that a $300 meal wasn't better!
Food is absolutely fantastic, including the BEST selection of cheeses
This gives me the power to suggest ANYTHING on the menu without the feeling of guilt
Great selection of wines, including a beautiful reserve wine list
Cons: Crazy noise level Overcrowding level
Service among certain staff members - some of the wait staff are naturally rude
Suggestive Dining: When low in dough, try prix fixe
For a romantic evening, start off with a fondue then the entrees
Try out the carefully selected wines by glass, so you can match different wines with different courses
After the dinner, ask your wait staff to send fromager to help you select cheeses
End your romantic evening with a chocolate fondue and warm drinks
You may get agitated at less than a prompt service, but if you're there to enjoy dining, you'll never have any problem with the service
i went with a friend the other night
we had this cheese and potato tart, cheese rolls and swiss fondue that was out of this world
the service was really nice and informative
the layout of the restaurant is not great, very crowded
but go for the cheese

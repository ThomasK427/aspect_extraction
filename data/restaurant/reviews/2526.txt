food was impressive, but not over the top
try the squash blossoms (wow!) the cavatelli (homemade)
and a serious winelist with out the big prices (organic selections too)
professional service, by a young staff that makes you fell very comfortable
After viewing the website, you had high expectations for Vespa
The food was okay nothing amazing, but I did enjoy the outdoor seating area
It is not as spacious as the website portrays it, but it does the trick for a couple New Yorkers like me and my friend
I took a friend there for his birthday -- they were very accommodating with freezing the cake and surprising my friend
They also have a very extensive wine list --- and a very knowable staff on hand to answer any questions you may have
All and all I give an A for the atmosphere and a B for the food
The food and service was great
Guytano (sorry about spelling?) treated us like we had been customers for years
If the weather permits try to sit outside
My fiancee and I ate here last Thursday night and the experience was nothing short of wonderful
The outdoor garden was a perfect spot for our romantic dinner
The food was excellent and reasonably priced, the wine list was great (we selected a nice Chianti Classico), and our server was terrific
We'll eat here again very soon!
Went on Friday night with my boyfriend and a friend and all 3 of us loved it
I made reservations and we were seated promptly
We chose to sit in the outdoor garden which was great
Romantic and perfect for a date, even though we weren't on one
It was a little hot in the garden though-no breeze in the back although it was a cool night
The rose wine we ordered was perfect
Started with the fresh mozarella and baby clams mussels for appetizers-very tasty but not exceptional
I had the taglierine-pasta with scallops
Their pasta is homemade and amazing
My boyfriend had the lamb ragu and he said it was delicious
Friend had the bass and said it was only average
Still we all decided we'd definitely return
About $36 a person after tip and tax
Pretty Cool place for the upper-east side
great food, wine the service was very professional
nice job all around
Fantastic thru thru
The food is sensational, the chef's are well rounded, the wait staff is attentive down to earth, the wine selection is superb, the music is impeccable(check out thursday nights Dinner a DJ), and the owner is extremely knowledgeable
Decor is original and what till u check out the garden in the back
You feel like u are dining in some Italian villa with a romantic mood with warm refreshing lightening
Who can refuse Disco Sunday's with a Raspberry Mojito a handsome DJ
We had reservations for a table outside at 8:30pm, but were asked us to wait a few minutes, which is standard for New York restaurants
At 9:15pm, I inquired on the status on our table
Without a smile or an apology the hostess says we must wait another 30 -40 minutes for a table outside, and that she couldn't honor outdoor reservations anyway
Of course I declined to wait longer and left
Good god, what's the point of letting people book tables if you cannot honor?! And to top it off, what's with the attitude?! The fact that the hostess had such poor form in addition to the wait makes me cross this restaurant off my list forever
Apparently the same hostess was also trying to kick out a group of women having drinks at a table and giving them a hard time for holding up a table
Located in the midst of other bars to socialize in the lower 80's of the upper east side, this hang-out is just terrific- food, service, ambiance, etc! Outside deck is cool for groups( I had the pleasure of eating out here just after it was completed last summer) and inside can be especially romantic
Intimate bar when you walk in to have a before or after dinner drink
Food is amazing and afordable
I hope my date is smart enough to bring me here someday!
Met someone for dinner the other night at Vespa and it was the best dining out experience I have had in a while
Between the food (the gnocci!), the DJ, the wine, and the general vibe it's a great place to bring a date (sexy crowd too)
The owners are also really friendly
Definitely going back to Vespa for the quality dining in a place that is cool without trying too hard
Looking for a place to have a romantic dinner, maybe dine with a group of friends or just a night out with the kids? Then I would highly recommend Vespa, considering I have done all of the above
I just cannot get enough of the Gnocchi one of my favorite dishes
From Vespa's wine list to the selection of exquisite appetizers and entree's they have become a must vist for friends and family when in the city
Enjoy!
One of my favorite spots when visiting from LA
Very charming
Went to Vespa a few weeks ago for dinner - all-around great restaurant! We had the mussles clams, frogs legs and polenta appetizers to start and black linguine and red snapper entrees - each thing I tasted was better than the last
The wine list is unique with lots of reasonably priced choices, but definitely try the raspberry mojito before you start your bottle of wine - it's excellent
Unfortunately, the weather wasn't great, so we didn't get to sit outside, but inside was cozy - low-lit with lots of small tables - and no complaints about the service
And the pear tart definitely made my list of top ten desserts
I highly recommend it!!
They have the best staff ever, Phil was just awesome, me and my girlfriends had my best birthday ever
The food wasgreat too
Finally a great cool spot on the Upper East side
Seems very casual when you first enter, but they really know their stuff
The food Service were excellent and the winelist was well put together and very well priced
I tried a White Wine called Lugana on their recommendation and it was perfect
I can't wait to go back and try to snag a seat in their garden
Amazing what they did with this place
It was a homey funky place with cool stuff on the walls, friendly staff and fantastic Italian food
None of that has changed, only now they've spruced it up with a killer garden, a dj and an impressive wine list and more creative food
It's a great date place or friends esp since you never feel rushed
I've eaten allover the hood and few places make you feel as welcome as Vespa
Check out the cold anti-pasta platter, perfect for sharing
The fish and pasta dishes also rock! You can't go wrong
Bravo Vespa!
Wonderful atmosphere and amazing food! Is in a great part of town, and has a to die for garden in back
I absolutely love this place! The food is outstanding and they change the menu with the seasons
The wine list is extensive, as well as unique, and the staff is knowledgeable and eager to make recommendations
There's always good music and a very good looking crowd
And the garden!!!! Vespa is the perfect blend of casual dining and upscale quality
My friends and I can't get enough
Food was good, service was good, loved the back porch
Not sure why Tony's is always packed
This is the best Italian on the Upper East
Wine list is amazing too, but you need some help from the staff to navigate it
They are more than willing
FANTASTIC!!! My boyfriend and I were wondering around the city for two hours because it was such a beautiful day and we became hungry
I had seen the outdoor garden online here on citysearch
We walked in and we were instantly greeted by one of the owners
We req
the outside area which was not officially opened, but he gladly sat us outside and said he would move us if it was too cold
it was perfect and the heating lamp kept us warm
I started w/ a yellow watermelon Margaherita which was delicious followed by a lemonchelo martini also fabulous
we split frogs legs followed by pasta(homeade)
Finally a warm chocolate dessert
Service was impeccable
Food-damn good and VIBE-cool, but nice

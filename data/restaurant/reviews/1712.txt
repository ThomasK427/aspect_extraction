They've got some imports on tab
aka Heffe
It's amazing to me that this place continues to suffer from god-awful service
We sat in the outdoor garden and waited for over 45 mintues for a waitress to even approach our table
All we wanted was a bottle of wine, so we tried ordering from the bar, but the bartender was busy running food
EVERY single table was complaining and the waitresses did nothing but appologize time and time again
When we finally ordered our wine, the waitress brought the bottle of wine over with ONE GLASS MISSING - meaning, we'd have to wait even longer for the final glass to arrive - which were all piping hot from the dishwasher
Please don't bother with this place until they get their act together, but this has been going on for YEARS, so I guess they don't really care
so neither should you!
I stumbled upon Luca Lounge witha few friends one evening
it was quite a pleasant surprise
The food is deliciouse, the ambiance is VERY ROMANTIC and they make you feel quite at home
Sitting in the front dining room is a great experience beacause you get to see right into their kitchen with their huge brick oven which only adds to the already romatic ambiance
The food has always been delicious (i recomend sharing the lasagna dishes becasue they are HUGE) The appetizers rock as well
The Guiness is always nice and fresh on tap and the wine is lovely
The service we have never had a problem with so theefore I was surprised to read the other reviews
Every one is entitiled to their own opinion
Mine is that this place is great
Especially for a romantic date!
Went out with 20 people for a party
Very happy with the atmosphere, the place is comfortable and roomy
But from the minute we sat down, we had problems with the waitstaff
They were not accomodating, and would dissapear for 45 minutes after taking orders
On three seperate occasions, my drink order was 'lost'
Spent most of the night having to go to the bar to get drinks
Drinks we did get were sometimes not what we ordered
To top it off, we were charged extra for not spending enough through the waitress
Although eventually an understanding was reached with the competent management, our particular waitress was EXTREMELY rude and VERY incompetent
Avoid until they get some waiters who know what they are doing
Though this place looks cute, the staff are not so nice
Our waitress took 45 mintues to bring the drinks, forgot a round and then tried to charge us $100 when we left because we hadn't ordered enough drinks! We had, just not from her
We were in a big group for a birthday, and had been in the bar for 6 hours, so it was a low point in the night to be accused of under-ordering and charged
Luckily, the manager sided with us, so we didn't pay
Beware!!!!
It was Saturday night, and I couldn't find a place to take my friends to celebrate my birthday
We stumbled upon the Luca Lounge with no reservation, AND we were quite a large party
The hostesses did what they could to find us a table, even though the place was PACKED- and WE'RE REALLY HAPPY THAT THEY DID!!! The place is great! Very chill, cool tunes, friendly staff, strong drinks, reasonably priced, good food
No complaints here! I'll definitely come here for more parties! (I'll remember to make a reservation next time
)
I have never been to a place with worse service in the city! The 2 female bartenders are too busy making themselves shots to take your order
Or they are too busy scoping for cute guys to serve rather, than the usual first come first serve fashion
They are too incompetent to serve food or drinks let alone speak
And don't expect the manager to help you out, apparently he will always back up the incompetent staff he hired
Would't go there unless you feel like getting horrible service and yelled at by bartenders
Went there on a Friday night: Not too crowded, friendly sexy waitresses
Very strong mixed drinks
You can smoke cigarettes in the outdoor area, which is really convenient
Patrons are a bit too trendy for me but seem friendly
Very nice decor, amd very dim
(Didn't try the food)
great atmosphere, comfy couches, great lighting, good music, not too loud to where you cant hear the person next to you
Lots of fun
Only drawback is the service - I made reservations for a birthday party for 20 well in advance
I showed up with my group and they said they had overbooked (not apologetic at all) and my friends and i would have to sit by the front door in the waiting area all night (seating for less than 10 people!!!) I had to complain several times before they finally let us into the main lounge area (which was empty) and they gave me HUGE attitude as if they were doing me a favor and I was this difficult customer
Overall, I was happy with my experience, if you can overlook crap service then you will have a great time because the ambiance and space is really great!
walking in looks like your typical bar scene, however, the rear opens up to a very laxed scene: tons of places to sit, an open yard filled with seats and dimmed lights, large open areas with vintage couches and chilled out lamps - great for spring - fall
drinks are relatively cheap, and the people are real
looking for a chill evening with a few friends, this place is a must
Great decor and even better food! There new back room is a terrific place to have a party and dining in the back patio in the summer makes you feel like your not in the city
Luca's food and atmosphere is wonderful! Their Lasagna tastes better than homemade and their prices are amazing! It's a terrific gathering place to bring your friends
Everytime I have been there has been a great experience
I highly recommend it!
The place is hip and the decorations funky, but the food is lacking
There's VERY little on the menu, to start with, and the portions aren't that great
(The pizza, however, is tasty and good sized
) I didn't think it was such a great date place when there are so many other, more authentic (and hip) Italian places around (that don't play Depeche Mode as background music)
The menu selection was limited
The service was absolutely awful
The waitress spilled wine and soda on my shoes jeans
I expected her to at least offer refills on our drinks, but not only did we not receive the refills, I had to ask for napkins to clean myself and the table up!!
Have to agree with many here
The food is very well prepared, the ambience is relaxing, the prices are most sensible
But the service? Hmmm
I've had both excruciatingly poor service and very good service, which is disappointing
On occasion I have had to get up and gently remind the waitress that my drink was empty, or wait an age to order
I am not rude, and I'm always extremely patient with restaurant staff - it's not always an easy job, but in an empty restaurant not being attended to is pushing it a bit
The service has mostly been better when the place has been busier
I'm sure there's a reason for that
This is one of my favorite dining spots in the East Village
Funky furniture, chill tunes and soft lighting create a warm and inviting atmosphere
The portion sizes are plentiful and the food always quite good
this place is so cool
on AVE b? ave A, yes, but there's not much nearby
I live around the corner and can't wait for the neighboorhood to open up to more places like this! Great chairs and cocktails at 7P for a date, or a nice group of 6 can have 2 pizzAs a large family-style salad, a cheese platter, bottle of italian wines or sangria - Really NIce
Warm atmosphere, great chairs, good staff, and the crowd knows they're hip without having to flaunt it
Visit Ave B - maybe they'll be more places like this soon enough~
Having been here when it first opened and then occasionally through out this year--I have to say I am always so impressed
The food is just what your looking for; from pizzettes to imaginitive Italian dishes
The staff seem to blend right into the harmony and ambiance that the decor easily accomplishes
Wine list and cocktails are perfect to the T
Overall, I've made a habit of visiting every weekend and can find no other place so deserving of the money I work hard to earn all week
I HAD A BIRTHDAY PARTY LAST WEEKEND WITH A COUPLE OF FRIENDS AND WE HAD THE BEST TIME! WE SAT IN THEIR NEW ROOM WHICH IS REALLY COOL AND PRIVATE
THEY MADE IT REALLY EASY TO GO OUT WITH A BIG GROUP (A CHEAP PRIX FIXE MENU AND FOR DESSERT
WE HAD A CHOICE OF A COUPLE OF LITTLE DESSERTS OR A WHOLE CHOCOLATE CAKE! I THINK THAT IS A GREAT DEAL!!!
Went here with a bunch of friends one night
The good thing? Fun decor, with big couches and comfy chairs, letting you lounge around while you eat
But stay away from the food, unless you want some decent pizza
The lasagna was watery and chewy, with little flavor
The pastas we ordered were also bland
I don't know if I went on a particularly bad night, but the sodas were so flat and the water tasted so bad that we all ordered wine instead

They also have a very beautiful staff from the bartender to the waitresses
I was very impressed and I highly recommend a Sunday dinner at Palma
(try the sea bass, they filet it in front of you with great skill!!)
I have eaten at Palma twice now, and both times have had excellent service
The waiters and waitresses have always been lovely, but the bar staff can be a bit of a mixed bag
Other than that, the space is very nice and very versatile - romantic, cozy, relaxing, warm
The outdoor patio is perfect for larger groups, weather permitting
The food is top-notch, and reasonably priced
If it wasn't for the maitre d', this would be a perfect little place
Great ambiance and perfect food, however the maitre d' MUST GO
Even with a couple of open tables it was clear this ungrateful host wanted to 'flip' our table in less than an hour
We ordered wine, starters, entrees, coffee and dessert When we offered to have our coffee in the garden following a down pour (so he could use our table!) he told us he did not have enough dry table cloths but 2 minutes later he seated other couples in the garden
The wait staff was very friendly and hard working, but they did seem a little afraid of the pain-in-the-ass maitre d
What a hidden treasure
The food was excellent as well as the decor
Although the bartender had major attitude issues
Luckily, the manager sat us quickly and saved us from the misery
I highly recommend this place, but I would asked to be seated immediatedly and not have an cocktail at the bar
Having dined at many Italian restaurants in the city, this one is a true gem
The food was delicious (the artichoke and lamb was A+) and the staff was truly a pleasure
Our waiter, Ian, was very attentive and I must admit we are high maintenance eaters (on the side etc
)
The garden is beautiful and the decor brings you back to Europe
This is a definite must go
Highly recommend
What a beautiful place, my husband and I felt like we were Italy again
The food was very good and the manager was more than accomodating
He actually took the time to explain the menu at length, we were pleasantly surprised
If you want take a trip to the Mediterranean in NYC, this is the place
Maybe they were having a bad day for the other guy, but our experience was completely different
A charming restaurant , with great innovative food and friendly service
They have small intimate seating in front, an inner private courtyard with tables and umbrellas and a very private house behind the courtyard set up like a Tuscan kitchen for special small group parties
Very romantic Village secretplace
Service a step slow , but who notices
Maybe some folks came on a bad day, but our gruop had the a great meal, in what has to be one of the charming restaurants in NYC
Its located on a Village brownstone street
They have a inner private courtyard and if you want they also have a a small house in the courtyard set up like a kitchen in Tuscany for more private parties
The foods was just wonderful and the service, friendly and welcoming albeit a bit slow (who really noticed )
A rare gem GO there , but reserve in advance
The staff was non-existent, the food was bad, not just taste but freshness
The clams were'nt even open
I can't believe I stayed in that place for as long as I did
The worst resturant experience I've ever had
sorry to say- i know it's a cute little place with a gardenin the west village bla bla bla
but it ain't worth it
i sooo wanted to like it
i love places with outdoor gardens
but this place blew it
the service was so non-existant
the waiter came by once and returned-no joke-45 minutes later
but the worst part was the food
not only did it take over an hour half for it to arrive, it was unedible
seafood was terrible
you know, when sea food smells like seafood-it ain't fresh
oh, and the manager was rude
he could have been nicer and offered to give us something else or something but nope
all in all-it was a very dissapointing dinner

I celebrated my birthday at Palma with drinks in the garden and a spectacular private dinner in the farmhouse! The ambiance, service and food were outstanding
My guests were thrilled with the entire evening and I recommend this experience to all
I recently went with a group of 10 for a friend's birthday dinner
We ordered mozzarella with tomatoes to start and it took over an hour to get that
When we complained, they said they were having some problems in the kitchen and we would have to be patient
We asked for more bread in the mean time and never even got that
Dinner was further delayed and the entrees were bad
Undercooked pasta (still crunchy), luke warm lamb, and overdone fish
We arrived at 8:30 and didn't leave until 11:30 (not because we were having fun)
AND THEY DID NOT EVEN TAKE ANYTHING OFF OUR BILL as a thanks for being patient
Stay away from this place!

I hosted a business dinner
We enjoyed our meals
The halibut was simply perfect
Really sweet!! Guests loved the sea bass
The wines were different but tasty
Not too expensive
My Boyfriend and I stoped by Palma last weekend it had been a while since we were in town we are from atlantic city and we love coming up for shows
It was truly dissapointing experience; our palates had a party last time we were here but things have changed
the delicious rabbit with parpadele noodles i had it was not on the menu anymore , the hot chocolate souflee also was gone
it was a less inspired effort
what happened to the pillow soft gnocci with mascarpone and gorgonzola ???? i dont get all these positives reviews the whole experience left alot to be desired
i was very sad now we have to find a different place to visit
this restaurant is very cute and quiet and romantic
it had very good food
the lobster salad was stupendous and the lamb chops and the halibut were delicious
Our waitress, on the other hand, was less than satisfactory
The garden was lovely and it's got a nice room for private parties
I went to Palma last Saturday with my Fiance and a group of friends and had a fantastic evening
Everything from the drinks to the dessert was incredible
The chef (I believe his name is Amed) came over to our table throughout the evening to make sure everything was to our liking
The service, quality of food, and atmosphere were all top-notch
We will defintely be returning
The ambience in this restaurant is really quite nice -- very warm and cozy and comfortable
My husband and I had dinner here the other night with a friend, and while none of us were blown away by our meals, we still had a wonderful time because of the setting and because of the friendly and attentive staff
Don't get me wrong, the food is fine - but it doesn't have that wow factor
My bufala mozarella was a little too salty and the seafood risotto was a tad too al dente
My husband had the seabass and it didn't leave much of an impression on him, but he says the lobster salad was worth another try
All in all, it's still worth the visit if you just want to have a nice, romantic night but aren't too concerned with eating average food
Wandering Cornelia Street we were lured by the buttery warmth and unpretentious charm of Palma
I had gnocchi with gorgonzola cream, then lamb

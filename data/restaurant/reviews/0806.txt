Our favorite dish is the Deep Fried Chicken, its more healthy than it sounds
Basically they deep fry the whole chicken so that the moisture gets sealed in and only the skin is crispy while the inside is tender and juicy
Or try the Beef Chow Fun or Peking Pork Chops
Of course, the congee is good too
Great for birthday parties
Bring a cake and when they serve it they will play the Happy Birthday song over the loud speaker and take a polaroid of you blowing out your candle
Not being Asian, we wondered in and were delighted by the friendly staff
They happily suggested items to try, based on our prefered tastes
Every one else in the restaurant, from happy children to grandparents were Asian and speaking other languages! It was like a gastronomic trip overseas!
This is the only Malaysian restaurant that I would recommend to anyone visiting NYC
They have excellent selection of Malaysian food as well as friendly staff
I highly recommend their Black Pepper Crab and their coconut prawn dish
Their beef rendang is excellent and tasty
Their Nasi lemak gives you value for the money
The soup dishes such, as Asam Laksa is excellent also
And don't forget dessert! They have this awesome coconut pudding that is presented inside the coconut shell
It's an excellent ending for an excellent dinner
This restaurant is small but the food is tasty and delicious
It light on the stomach not heavy at all
The service was good
If you want something simple like egg rolls and fried rice this is not the place to go
They have some great chef special dishes, like Thai chicken and roast beef
It's classy unique chinese
If you want a bit of a twist on chinese
this is the place to go
Great food, great service, pictures of Danny Ng and famous people
Hidden in a corner on Pell Street (right across from May May bakery), Danny Ng has been around for many years, unnoticed
Recently went there based on a friend's recommendation and was pleasantly surprised with the food
There were some misses, but overall the food was good and service was attentive (English speaking staff
)   Recommended dishes are the stuff conch, the shark fin soup (if you want to splurge), and the fried chicken with mui vegetable (house recommendation)
In Short Just stepping into this European-style cafe makes you feel properly intellectual
Almost everyone has a book open, a computer whirring or an important letter in progress
The menu mixes expected cafe fare, such as crispy hot panini sandwiches, a tangy house salad and luscious cakes, cookies, pies, pastries, with more ambitious daily specials, such as chicken liver pate, grilled endive salad and potato blintzes
One of my favorite places to get a cup of tea or to have a casual brunch with the newspaper
I ordered from Red Lantern for take out
When I went to the place, it was old and dingy
No ambience and the woman behind the counter didn't understand English too well
No wonder why the place was empty
In terms of the food, the pad thai was way overcooked and tasted quite poor
I was forced to throw it out
I assume since it was lunch time, they just had a huge vat of it sitting somewhere
I felt like the noodles were probably from the night before
When I called the restaurant to complain, they said thank you for telling us and hung up on me
Simply unprofessional and rude
Poor service and terrible food
i've had a couple of the curries here, which were good, but by no means wonderful
the lunch special also left me with some terrible side salad of meager iceburg lettuce and water-y dressing
the curry was mostly coconut milk and not much curry
flavor was weighed down by it, in my opinion
i have only carried-out, and that service was quick and friendly
I've eaten at Red Lantern a handful of times in the last couple years
We usually go as a group of 4-6 and the service and food have been excellent every time
Orders have varied from simple (pad thai) to different curries and all have been quite good
If anything is lacking, it's the ambience
It's not the focus
But go for the food
I think it would work for kids, provided they are adventurous eaters, and groups up to 8, 10, 12 should be fine
I used to frequent this restaurant on a weekly basis
After waiting 80 minutes for a delivery order and being called a liar by management, I will never order from this restaurant again
A Balucci's waiter verified with the manager that my order did indeed take 80 minutes
However, the manager refused to offer any concessions or discounts
I was treated very rudely despite being a loyal customer
There are too many good Indian restaurants in NYC to give your business to a restaurant that treats their customers so poorly
They do not value their patrons business and the management is rude
Normally we visit a Turkish restaurant on 3rd ave which is still wonderful and delicious but finding Sahara was one of the best things that happened to me when I moved into the neighborhood
As a wonderful alternative to my usual, this place never requires a reservation, you can always get a table and the food and staff is wonderful
I would recommend this to anyone who really enjoys good service and delicious Mediterranean food
What a great find on 2nd Avenue! Maybe I shouldnt rate this so good; I may have to wait now to get in!
What turned out to be a second choice for dinner turned into a great decision
The meze platter made the perfect appetizer - we ordered the small and it was more than enough for the three of us
The baba-gounoush (sp?) was excellent! And the homemade, piping hot bread was perfectly done
For entrees, the Ground Lamb in Spicy Sauce (can't remember the name on the menu) was perfectly cooked and had just enough kick for the average person
The Feyti (lamb kabob) was tender and wonderful
Yes the decor is exceedingly basic but that should not distract from the food or the friendly staff
I usually do take out
The lamb or chicken shish-kabobs are musts! Also the babaganous and lamb in tomatoe sauce are very very good
This restaurant is not a 'hot' place to go on a Saturday night
However, the food is excellent as is the service
I have returned a number of times and the waitstsff recognizes me immediately and greets/serves with a smile
The falafel is excellent and the prices are even better
My only complaint is the cheapish decor and a bellydancer who interferes with my enjoyment of the meal
Although, her dances are over by 9:00 pm and have learned to schedule my meals around that
I love this place! My friends and I have made it our place
The staff is very friendly and attentive
The grilled porkchops are my favorite
# S14 is a great value and plenty of food (porkchops over noodles) Order sauteed stringbeans and ask for extra garlic
It's fabulous! When they have it, get the special vegetable of the day: Watercress with garlic
They only have it once in a while but if you see it on the specials menu, GET IT! Everything is very tasty and its worth every penny! You can definitely get nice and stuffed with tons of food for 12 bucks per person!
Look out for slow service: the food has been overcooked or has been sitting around
We have tried this place a dozen times, and it never gets better
It was good once, but has slipped badly
Avoid especially on Sundays
Just ate here this past weekend
While not authentic Vietnamese, L'Annam serves very good food (think of it as a Chinese interpretation of Vietnamese food)
Prices are reasonable and portions are very generous
Service was quick and friendly
For appetizers, we shared summer rolls and spring rolls - they were good, not great
For an entree, I had the grilled pork chops and my girlfriend had the basil chicken with jumbo shrimp - both were great
This is one of the cleanest Vietnamese restaurants I've been to
The food is great - delicious pad thai and crystal dumplings

So satisfied, we're ordering again today
:-) The wings are excellent, shrimp and onion rings were pretty good and the Chicken sandwiches were great
Try it, you'll like it
The other reviewer must be kidding
I lived in the area for 3 + years and ordered there at least 2 times a week and tons for football season for my husband and his friends
They and I LOVE the wings
I tried places all over NYC and they are the best
The fries are great too!
If you like celery and blue cheese, this place is great
Otherwise you are out of luck
While a variety of sauces are featured, all will rather poorly disguise a just plain lousy chicken wing
If you don't won't wings, you can have fried food
What kind of fried food you may ask? It doesn't matter--chicken sandwich, biscuits, fries--it all tastes the same:BLEECH! While their delivery is quick, that bleech feeling just loafs around for days
I recommend Pluck U over this joint anyday!
I've lived in the neighborhood on and off for a decade and this place is good, clean, fast Chinese for the price/delivery
If service seems rude it's just the language barrier
They also have another Chinese/Mexican place further up Second Avenue
Out of all the chinese food places in east midtown (and there are plenty out there), this place has not disappointed me yet
The egg drop soup is one of the best I've ever eaten, they have good quality meat, and the service is excellent
This place is the only chinese place I get takeout/delivery from
Their food is really good and has quality ingredients - the chicken fried rice has pieces of real chicken, not that gross chewy stuff you get at a lot of chinese places
Their dumplings are amazing, and they have all kinds (not just pork like most places), and their main dishes are really good too
I've always found the people to be nice and the service good
Definately give it a try
If you want bad food and even worse customer service then you have found your place
On a recent Saturday night my friends and I placed an order at 6pm
At 7pm the wrong food shows up
They said that they will bring a new order and our money back
30 minutes later they bring our money and no food
Where's the food? I ask
The delivery guy looked dumbstruck
When calling back I was met with a rude employee and an even more rude manager
After explaining to the manager the situation she said to me we are not doing business with you anymore
And then she hung up on me
Unacceptable in my book
You can decide for yourself if you want to do business with people like that
Proceed with caution
In Short For nearly 20 years this family-run restaurant has been renowned for its salt and pepper shrimp, an exquisitely simple dish in which the shrimp are liberally seasoned and flash fried
The rest of the menu includes 202 made-to-order items, like countless dumplings--both steamed and fried--and Cantonese specialties, like crispy roasted duck and fragrant soup
Regulars eat in the casual dining room, or take their dinner to go
I went here with a few friends and we definately enjoyed the meal! BYOB is the way to go for dining out in the city at a place with such an extensive menu! The waitor/owner was more than willing to give us descriptions of the dishes and how they were prepared and everything he recommended was delicious! Overall we had a great time, we drank as much as we wanted, and the price was just right!
Worst experience for group dining so far
Owner was extremely rude, and belittle OUR orders, only to recommend the most expensive dishes without disclosing cost
Overcharged us, and charged $30 for ice buckets alone
Even after overbilling, and horrible service, tacked on a mandatory 20% tip
When I inquired about the charges, the owner told me to chill
Will never go back
Food was unimpressive
The food makes the trip well worth while
While the setting may not be the most spectacular, nor the service the most friendly, the restaurant feels nicely cozy, and the owners become more jovial the more one patronizes the restaurant
But, besides aesthetic superficial concerns, the cuisine is fantastic
Try seasoned snow peas, or peking duck for an outstanding meal
Phoenix Garden is by far the best Cantonese restaurant in NYC
Their menu is extensive and the dishes are always fresh and meticulously prepared
They always give the patrons the best and freshest ingredients available in the market
Their seafood dishes are unparalled for the price
The decor is simple but pleasant
The service is attentive but not annoying
Order anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed
I have dined here for over 20 years and I know the management will NOT compromise the cuisine for any haute trendy fare
The roots of the menu for anyone who is versed in Cantonese cuisine is for foodie purists like myself
Food is culture and history
This place has both
BAD SERVICE!!! The owner is so RUDE!!!!!!! They only recomend you the most expensive dish on each category
And they will rush you like crazy! We were still eating but they started cleaning up the table!!!! I will never go back to that restaurant again!!!!!
Phoenix Garden is a gem for authentic Hong Kong Cantonese in NYC without having to go to Chinatown
I have been a die-hard supporter of this restaurant since they were in Chinatown
The food is absolutely amazing, authentic and all items are freshly cooked
Pepper-salty shrimp, crustaceans, steamed fishes, casserole and squab dishes are just some of my must haves
Though the place can be loud and sometimes seem unruly, this family operated restaurant prides itself on providing a great eating experience for all diners
Anyone who has dined here knows that the family has a low tolerance for patrons who ask about white sauce or brown sauce, egg-foo young and egg-rolls
This is a place where patrons come to enjoy the renowned gastronomical Cantonese delights served efficiently
For first-timers, leaving your order up to the very knowledgeable owners and staff will undoubtedly having you come back for more!
The food quality is excellent very light on the stomach
It is a nice and quiet place yet in a run down old building
The service is ok
Waiters and waitresses are helpful
Parking is not easy to find
This place serves among the best Cantonese food north of Chinatown
However, the portions are small, the decor is as run-down as the average Chinatown joint, and the prices don't reflect this
We paid (plus tip) over $35 for a plate of fried rice, a simple chicken dish, 8 dumpling pieces and two sodas
Similar quality food would cost about $20-$25 at a good Chinatown place, and you wouldn't feel hungry afterwards, either, or have to pay extra for some white rice
The service wasn't good -- dumplings were served after we had almost finished the main courses, drinks had to be asked for three times, etc
As we left, the owner compared the restaurant to Shun Lee Palace
Was he kidding? I'm not sure
i ordered lunch special and asked for no soy sauce on my food as i wanted to put it on myself
when the appetizer came and i put soy sauce on it, the owner came over to me and denigated me for doing that out loud so that people could hear me
there was no reason for him to treat a customer that way
i decided to have leave out of humiliation and asked for the rest of my lunch to be wrapped up for take out
when i got back to my office as opened up my lunch, the portions were so small that they gave me less than normal portion out of spite
You get small portions of mediocre food, with unjustifiably high prices and *extremely* rude service
I don't recommend it
I have never ever seen such rude service at a restuarant
They give you attitude when you order--I have even seen them yelling at customers- and they try to rush you out of there
The food is just ok and is expensive considering the quantity of food they give you
The owners appear to be a Chinese family and they are so rude
Also, they only accept cash---no credit card--which is very shady
You get what you pay for
The digs are not fancy (i

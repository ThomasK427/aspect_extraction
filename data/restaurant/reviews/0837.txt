I love it!!!
Poor Service, Average Food, High Prices, and Small Portions best describe Parish Co
Once seated the waiter took our drink orders only to return 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks
I should have taken this as a sign of what was yet to come and flee cutting my losses with lousy drinks
The order, two portion sizes to choose small and smaller
We ordered an assortment of apps
which came 40 min
later and cold
Main dishes were cold as well and the filet mignon was overcooked
After complaining the waitress offered a lame excuse - it's friday night - like that should explain the bad service and food
Avoid this restaurant and go elsewhere - your wallet will thank you
The food at Parish was tasy and well-prepared, but the portions were absurdly miniscule, especially in proportion to the prices
The small (tasting menu size) portions were equivalent to cocktail party hors d'oeuvres, while the large portions were essentially appetizer-size
The bottom line is that if you are willing to order many many dishes and empty your wallet, you can have a satisfying meal
I love this place
The incredible but simple raw bar, artisanal cheeses crostini's (avacado, ricotta) are my favorite starters
The small plate / large plate concept makes it easy to try different dishes in the right sizes
I love trying a lot of things and it's even encouraged here
The staff is professional and knowledgeable but relaxed and the decor is comfortable and stylish
The music is easy on the ears, think hip but not hip-hop
Up front is a gorgeously long oak bar surrounded by wall lined banquettes and ottamans and in the rear, a more private and romantic dining room high on style and atmosphere
My favorites are the Hen-Of-The-Woods Mushroom Salad, the Seared Tuna with Cashews Broccoli Raab and the Hanger Steak with Mashed Potatos
And after, head down one block to Billy's Bakery for dessert
pure sin
Go now!
I have dined several times at Parish, solo, in tete-a-tete and as a group, each instance offered a new experience-be it seated at the bar, casual at front or more formal at the back
With the exception of the pedestrian and over-rated fish caramelized nut dish I would recommend the diversified menu on any day-quite refreshing to have a creative chef on staff even better to have one use fresh/organic and local produce
The music is all over the place but not too loud and yes the a/c is on freezer high-so bring a sweater
Nothing one of their excellent old fashioned cocktails can't cure
Parish is a classic that is meant to please fine palates
The food was different
Definitely an unusual menu
Their service for a table of 8 was extremely poor
Went on Tuesday nite when only 2 other tables filled
I'm not sure where the wait staff was 1/2 the time, they were NOT attentive to our needs
They would fill up only 2 glasses of water and leave the others left unfilled
Took forever to take drink/dinner orders
They never returned to the table after dinner was served to check if we needed anything
We always had to find someone to get us something
I orderd the black cod and was told this was the only dish that didn't come with anything since it was a light fish, so in addition i had to order a side
A light fish, NOT come with a side ?? very strange
If this place can improve their service, it would be a BIG plus
After wandering in one evening I have become addicted to the farmers market fresh menu
I dont know another place in New York that serves organic Belle Rouge chickens
The heirloom organic greens are extremely fresh
They have the intense attention to ingredients that reminds me of my early days in Berkeley eating at Chez Panisse
The oysters The only failing is the desserts
They are serviceable but nothing to write home about
Service is fine, sometimes slow but sometimes fast
The wine list is simple and has a few jems like the Jacques Selosse Champagne
Overall- a fairly undiscovered jem of of place with a passion for organic inventive dishes
I went here three times: twice as a couple and once with a large group
Both times it was just two of us, the food and service were above average and the atmosphere is great
When a came with 16 people, they were totally overwhelmed
They kept forgetting to bring drinks
The service was painfully slow and the food came out cold or improperly cooked
Don't overwhelm them and you will have a lovely experience
Tasting menu you design yourself makes this a fun new resturant idea
The eclectic menu is interesting, but does not deliver on all fronts, so ask your waiter for recommendations
Be prepared to sit back, relax and enjoy the experience, for service can be a little slow
I look forward to many more tastings at this fun new Chelsea addition
Parish is a great new space in Chelsea
The food is fantastic
Most of my experience is at lunch
have the BBQ pork
Reasonably priced wine and tapas type options just add to the comfortable atmosphere
Ask for Timea, she's fantastic
Parish allows you to try their upscale and tasty menu with smaller (and lower priced) portions of their tasty menu
Although the portion is downsized, the taste and quality isn't and you should eat less anyway, right? It's also got a great atmosphere, bar and small but excellent wine list
A great follow up to the old Orson's bar on the east side
I plan on telling everyone I know about this place even though I don't like to share my discoveries but this one needs to flourish
Their burger is really great too!
Can't beat this place
Great food, friendly staff, not too pricey, what more can you ask
We stayed until we were the last ones there and never at any time felt rushed in any way
Decor makes you feel like you're not even in NY - simplistic yet elegant
And how big can that bar actually be? Can't wait to go back
Parish Co
is wonderful
The space (formerly a speakeasy, Diablo, JBs
,) has been transformed into a very sexy and warm environment
The food is truly wonderful
Try the many dishes that they have to offer
The crispy scallop dumplings, cucumber/avocado soup, watercress salad with goat cheese, oysters, shell steak and the pork tenderloin are all good
Waitstaff is excellent
very friendly and accomodating
It is already getting great word of mouth
so make reservations! Parish Co
is a restaurant that will be around for awhile - - - that is saying alot because the space has been cursed
The Scene Welcome to the new fast-food nation: A bright, modern burger joint with orange polka-dot decor, loud music, campy comic-book posters (featuring superhero mascots like Buns-o-steel) and an organic, natural menu with meat- and dairy-free options
It's already a neighborhood hangout, particularly with the hard bodies who clamor for the metal-flaked bar stools and big booths
The Food When the counter guy asks, "Would you like better fries with that?" say "Yes
" The crispy air-baked potatoes are the best things on the menu
Go with the ultra-lean, flavorful ostrich burger, ground-tuna sandwich or snappy soy hot dogs
The thin organic burger lacks the flavor of a prime beef patty, requiring add-ons like cheese (cheddar, Swiss or soy-based), bacon (maple-cured or faux) and grilled onions
Sides like creamy smashed potatoes and daily soups are good, but the pre-packaged salads and oily vegetable stir-fries smack of airplane food
My wife and I stumbled upon this burger joint on a Thursday evening while walking around the neighborhood
The modern and bright orange dcor of this place was inviting and so we gave the place a try for a quick dinner
We stepped in and ordered the natural chicken burger, organic beef burger, veggie slaw and organic fries
The beef and chicken burgers were good and the choices of condiments and specialty sauces added flavor to the sandwiches

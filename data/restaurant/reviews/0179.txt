I'm a big fan of Gramercy Tavern so I was a little disappointed by this restaurant
The food is tasty but expensive and delivered to the table in a very sterile manner
I understand the concept, but to receive a plate with just a piece of fish on it and no garnish for $36 seemed like a rip-off
My boyfreind and I visited Craft after seeing all of the rave reviews and quite dissappointed! The space is beautifully decorated making us excited for our meal but the food was horrible
The Potato Risotto was bland and crunchy
The Rabbit dish was very gamey and I was afraid the thing might jump off my plate
They use a great deal of rosemary in this dish and even the smell was nauseating
Deserts failed as well with the very bland chocolate tart which tasted like something I could have made in my easy bake oven back in elementary school
Definately a dissapointment for the price
Best meal I've tasted in a long time
Very fresh, simple, local foods with a style all their own
Excellent service
Worth every penny
The food is the best in the city! I love the simple presentation and the fabulous flavor
The desserts were delicious too! Unfortunately, the service isn't quite up to par
bt the food speaks for itself
The food is unbeatable
The atmosphere is top notch and the service is impeccable
I can't wait to go back!!!!
Why aren't you on the best of list? This kind of thing is what has made Citysearch very shady and subjective in the past
This is by far one of the top five restaurants out there right now
If you can get in, GO! If you can't, wait it out and eat at the bar-my favorite place to eat anyway
Cute, friendly bar tenders and great drinks
When you eat, do not miss the skate, the foi gras (sauteed not terrine) and the incredible shortribs! I had sweet little baby peas last night and beets that looked like little jewels! RUN don't walk!!!!
Uninspiring menu, so-so food and very overpriced for what it is
TOTALLY NOT worth it
the entrees were nothing to write home about and the service was terrible
they messed up our order
forgot about us for over a 1/2 hour
didn't ask us if we wanted dessert and then took another 10 minutues to bring the check
I would not go back and feel that there are so many other great restaurants in the city that blow this one away so SAVE YOUR MONEY and goes elsewhere
Definitely not worth the wait for the reservation
It is made out to be a lot more than it is, and the service sucks!!! Just another overly-expensive, pretencious place!
I've been for dinner and for lunch during restaurant week
BRAVO Craft for not serving me a salad, wedding chicken with brown glop and ice cream for dessert, as did Aureole and 21 Club
This was the best $20 lunch I have been to ever (and I am a pro)
Almost the entire menu was available
Too boot, we received a $10 gift cert for CraftBar
Sit at the bar (no reservations necessary), eat, talk to the bartender, and enjoy, b/c come dinnertime you will pay quadruple the price (but it's still worth it)
Happy dining!
A tasty encouter- take your time and enjoy each course and a great wine list
Craft is my favorite restaurant
Although you need to make reservations a month in advance, it's truly worth it
the food, the service and the setting is just perfect! I strongly recommend the sea bass, followed by the chocolate souffle
Bring a date, friends, family or all of the above and you will have a wonderful time
All of the food is perfect
Flawless
The Lamb chops I ordered were huge, thick, and cooked perfectly throughout! The mushrooms are flavorful, try the 'Hen of the Wood variety if they are available
Portions are large, and you get everything you want and nothing you don't
A la carte is pricey but worth it in the end
If you go to Craft, be prepared to work for your meal
Almost every aspect, from the sauce to the side dish, can be selected from the large and impressive menu
The restaurant encourages people to experiment and try different combinations
This is heaven for many a foodie who walks in the door
For those who are less inclined, you can ask the wait staff to make suggestions, which they are perfectly happy to do
Lots of work went into this restaurant, from the decor and impressive layout, the cheese course to the gigantic wine selection
In Short A comfortable theater-themed space that doesn't carry the metaphor too far
A row of stage lights illuminates the waitstation, and proscenium arches are simulated along the walls
The menu features American bistro dishes like crab cakes, chicken under a brick, fresh oysters and various seafood dishes
The breakfast menu lists omelettes, pancakes and more
Creme brulee, cheesecake and warm chocolate cake are among the dessert choices
Just recently visited this theatre district restaurant
My food was excellent
Yellow Tuna appetizer was great, as was my Filet, which was prepared with Blue Cheese
My guest had poor luck w/ the popcorn topped salad and her chicken
Desserts were very good
Service was not the greatest, as the waiter was not attentive enough and nearly caused us to miss our show
Would try again, but hope for more attentive service
If seeing an 8pm play
make sure to book your reservation for 6pm or earlier
the food is bad to mediocre, like airplane food quality, but trying to make nouvelle-esque dishes when they should keep it simple
The ambiance, is okay, is very midwestern-hotel
Do not waste your money at this place, there are so many nice places in the area, avoid district unless you're locked in the muse hotel
I have been to District several times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner plus I have stayed in the Muse hotel
I love everything about this place
The omlets are to die for, and the mini-burgers and wraps are my favorite for lunch
For dinner I love the tiered seafood appitizer and tuna tartar, for an entree the salmon and the steak are divine
I also love that this place (although American) serves Saki by the glass
The misture of flavors is delicious
Don't forget to stay at th Muse
I have stayed in some of the bext hotels in the world and the beds in this place are super comfy
Restaurant was very good and very close to the theatre district, hence the name
Food was very good and tasty, however I have had better Tuna Nicoise in Jersey! (Tuna was good, but not great
) The Prix Fixed menu has enough selections to please just about everybody
except my spouse
My spouse wanted an entree with shrimp and the waiter said that they could not accomodate her
The waiter checked with the kitchen after much prodding with him (we shouldn't of had to prod
) and the kitchen said that they could not prepare a special shrimp dish
Not even grilled shrimp? Go figure
The Scene Finding Town can be tricky: Unless you're spending the night at the Chambers Hotel, you might never even know it existed
Hidden in the back of the hotel, the dining room is comfortable, decorated in muted grays, suited to discussing real-estate ventures and other business
The Food Chef-owner Geoffrey Zakarian cooks in a rich, high-gloss style, and there isn't a single dish on the menu that has not been intensely prepared and intricately thought out
His menu's high points bear witness that the good aspects of this approach far outweigh the bad: vivid, chemical-green chilled pea soup with prosciutto; savory escargots in a dense truffled risotto; fluke carpaccio with bracing blood oranges and mint
Save room for the better-than-average petit fours, the best of which is an unusual but great single-malt scotch tartlet
Probably one the richest and most flavorful meals; greastes gastronomic experience Ive ever had
The service was impecacble
The space was breath taking and the people were beautiful
Ok so it was expensive and the hostess had an attitude; Its a trendy NY restaurant-GET OVER IT! There are lots of diners in jersey that will seat you promptly at 3AM
I have lived in NYC for 9 years and I have never received worst service from a restaurant
Thier food and ambience cannot make up for the bad service that I received

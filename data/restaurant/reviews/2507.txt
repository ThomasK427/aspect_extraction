The renowned wings come in mild, wild and--eek!--inhuman, and deserve their delicious reputation
The red chili shrimp burrito manages to taste light, even though it's stuffed with fixin's
i heard great reviews so i went here after work, ready to enjoy the famous roof seating and $3 margaritas
When my friend and i got our drinks it started raining so we had to move downstairs, which was fine
When we got our bill the drinks were full priced and when we asked, our waitress said that there is no happy hour on the roof
When we said that 1)we had no idea and 2)we were on the roof for a total of 5 min, she said you should have read the sign on the door saying no happy hour on the roof and that because we ordered on the roof, (even though we didn't get to enjoy our drinks on the roof) we had to pay full price
What a way to get customers to return
P
S
there was hardly any spinach in their famous spinach burrito
I found myself eating from here more times than I wanted to
I would get take-out usually, but it was a good place for groups, too
Great burgers, fast!!
My friend and I go to the Heights frequently, even though we live on Long Island, it's worth the trip into NYC for this place
Incredibly reasonable prices, powerful margaritas (will do you a mischief after more than 1- finally a place that doesn't skimp on booze), my favorite is their omlettes and potato leek soup to die for
Great people work there, very casual, unpretentious, cool roof deck
The only downer is when the place is overrrun by the college crowd (understandable since Columbia is nearby)
DEFINITELY GO!!!
If you come here, get the buffalo wings and the margaritas
Close to Columbia University and a great place to hang out after work
The food is always excellent and comes in large portions
The service is speedy and accomodating
Prices are also very low for the area
You just can't beat this place for a casual and fabulous dining experience
The burritos are fabulous and the margaritas are delicious (and strong!)
Just try to go before the throngs of Columbia kids descend on the place and pack it full
If you don't have much money - this is your best bet for the cheapest strongest margaritas on the upper west side
great columbia hang-out - but it does get crowded late night
if you go during the summer, you should eat up on the rooftop -
The frozen margaritas come in pint-sized glasses, and between 5 and 7pm, on weekdays, are only $2
50 each
These things are POTENT, and many a friend I have seen falter after number two
The roof-garden is an extra benefit, though the stairs are a bit steep on the way down (after the margaritas)
Food is not bad - nachos grande enough of a meal for two and the chicken wings are better than most
The Heights happy hour is the best time to go
The rooftop dining area is a nice place to eat in the summer
The burritos are alright and the drinks are great
In the land of the $20 breakfast, the Key West is astounding
I recently dropped by on a not-too-busy morning (Fri, 8 Am) and had a great b'fast for under 8 bucks
The feta omelete wasn't picture perfect, but tasted fine (lord knows I've scrambled an omlete a bit ot two over the years); the hash browns were good, and the OJ was just fine
I received good coffee frequently from the helpful staff as well
Those that complain may have dropped in at a bad time, or maybe they're used to staying at the Four Seasons
The hotel around the corner charges that much, but in NYC, that ain't squat
Left on it's own merits, the Key West is a wonderful spot
We ate here because it was right next to our hotel, and we were not really happy with any of our food
The service was good and very fast, but nothing was cooked properly
The eggs were runny, the bagel burnt, the home fries a mess
We stuck to McDonald's across the street after that
Ayurveda is a fabulous place to sit, enjoy and unwind
The food is fantastic
Sitting down and getting served without the hassle or indecision of a menu is great! The food is always amazing, and you can get 2nd and 3rd servings of your favorites
It may be vegetarian, but it is delicious and very filling
Be forewarned, Ayurveda is a quiet little place, so do not go with a large group or plan to have a loud/animated/emotional conversation
Many people go here alone and there's no shame in it! There is usually soothing rhythmic music playing
Go and enjoy
You will not be disappointed
I try to eat at Ayurveda once a week
Not only is it a great deal, but the food tastes so clean that it can only be good for you
The menu changes every day and I have never been disappointed
My favorite part is the dessert
I never knew vegetarian food could taste so good
Did I mention that you can eat as much as you want? The service is friendly and courteous
If you're like me who can never make up her mind about what to eat, this is the place for you
The service is excellent and within a few minutes of walking in, you will be presented with the thali of the day that includes several different dishes (including salad, chutney and rice)
The meal includes naans as well
The only thing you'll have to order yourself is the accompanying drink and like one of the other reviewers, I recommend the mango lassi, which is really the best one I've had in NYC
While the food is not outstanding, it is consistantly good and does not dissapoint
Also, don't expect much in terms of decor but the place is clean and not cramped like Thali
This place is a gem! Just go in, sit down and be served the lunch time $6
95 (2003) thali-of-the-day with a warm welcoming smile
This very satisfying meal of all the ayurvedic flavors comes with nan bread and a small dessert
The mango lassi is the richest and thickest I have ever tasted
Here's how it works: you walk in, sit down, and have a vegetarian thali (group of little portions of curries) that invariably includes lentiles, a small salad, some rice, some kind of samosa-like pastry, yogurt, rice, and a couple of sauces
The variation is in the 3 kinds of curry that you get
Also served is a basket of roti
There is nothing else on the menu except for exotic teas and cold beverages, but with a meal this cheap and delightful, who would care?
We placed an order online
An hour and twenty minutes later, I called to see where our order was
The woman told me that they don't always check that
I had to place the order again
It didn't get here for another hour
When it did, the food was terrible, incredibly overpriced and cold
To top it off, no apology whatsoever for the 2 1/2 hour wait
I just ordered take out from Ollie's on 116th, and when I arrived at my office on 168th street I realized they had forgotten the Roast Pork Bun (highly recommended!) that I had ordered
I called and they were incredibly nice and offered to deliver it up to 168th street
That is amazing service for a $1
50 bun
I was very pleased and will be a loyal customer
Some great things at ollies that I've discovered: the fish tofu casserole, shredded pork pickled cabbage noodle soup, eggplant chicken with garlic sauce
Service is pretty fast easy during busy hours
Pretty good!! The luncheon specials are great!Altogether a good place to eat in CU area
it's a little pricey though
My food was delivered very quickly and was definitely worth the price! The portion was big, and the food was good - especially the nan
Not the best Indian food I've ever tasted - but definitely up there!
It's not THAT great to be expecting customers to put up with higher prices and the poor service
THEY NEED TO HIRE MORE STAFF! They had us waiting forever
for everything from a table that would seat 5, to water, refills on drinks, to our check
(Went there b/c one of my friends was really in the mood for Ethiopian, or we would've seriously gone elsewhere
) Go there if you're just 2 or 3 have zero time constraints
We came expecting a nice meal, and we did have one - but the service, frankly, sucked!! They are way understaffed - two people working the floor, and when our food was finished, they took 20 minutes to bring our check to us

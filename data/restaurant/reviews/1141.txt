The atmosphere is warm and inviting
It's small and extremely romantic
The service is friendly and down home
Most importantly, the food is beyond description--it's EXCELLENT and Authentic
I would have to say it's even better than that other highly popular Tapas Bar owned by New York's favorite red-headed Italian chef, on 17th street and Irving Place
Tia Pol is the perfect neighborhood date and after work hangout place, no matter what neighborhood you live in
Tia Pol is the epitome of what a great neighborhood restaurant should be - great authentic food, nice people, prompt service
The tapas are wonderfully delicious
The chefs are really different here, no hype, no new contemporary whatever, just solid, delicious, home cooking Spanish food
The flan with orange is sooooo good if you still have room at the end of the meal
Thank you Tia Pol for coming to our West Chelsea neighborhood
If you're looking for atmosphere and a good glass of wine this is a great place, but if you have an empty stomach, forget it! My friend and I were hungry and so we chose the large cheese platter
altogether much more platter than cheese
For $15 we got 6 slivers of cheese about the size of my little finger
We also ordered the grilled shrimp ($7
50, 3 rather smallish but tasty shrimp), the whitebait (fantastic! vinagary, arriving in a glass lined with a paper napkin), tortilla spagnola (wonderful, and miraculously not miniscule), the peppers stuffed with potato salad (tiny but delicious) some olives (the smallest plate of olives I've ever seen), and finally the patatas bravas, which were drizzled with aioli and very good
Our bill came to $84 pre-tip and I definitely went home hungry
So beware, and eat before you leave home for Tia Pol
After a meeting, my husband and I stumbled on this restaurant on the way home
We were promptly greeted in French by who I assume was the owner
Our waitress was fabulously attentive
She was worth a return visit alone
The food was delectable
We had their price fixe menu and it was just wonderful
We left there beyond sated and will definitely return again
Exceptional food, very friendly service
The wait staff was very attentive with the supposedly rude owner being the warmest of all
He showed no bias towards non-french speakers and was very accomodating, even offering to replace any dishes we didn't like
I highly recommend this French restaurant
Great prices, great service - what more could you ask for?
I went with my wife over the weekend
The food was out of this world
I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates French Cuisine
The restaurant owner/manager shows complete bias to those who speak French
He denied me requests by simply saying no, and not as a joke
For instance, I asked him for a lemon for my water, and after curtly saying no, he walked away never to respond to my request
That is not to say that he did not frequently come to my table though
He rudely interupted a dinner with my friend, who I hadn't seen in 6 months to have long conversations with her throughout the whole meal
Speaking to her in French, he completely ignored me
Hence, while the food was good, due to the terrible injustice that exists there this is a restaurant I would not recommend to others
The Scene Chef Laurent Tourondel's second eponymous eatery takes on seafood (the first was BLT Steak)
The downstairs feels beach-shack casual with wooden booths and a raucous crowd
Upstairs could not be more different, with many diners flexing the corporate card
The bustling, open kitchen anchors one end of the dining room, but the retractable sky light roof is the room's dazzling centerpiece
Service on both levels is perky, and the soundtrack runs from Madonna to jazz
The Food The upstairs menu is largely a la carte, however, bits of the seafood shack mentality creep in--notably the complimentary cheesy biscuits
The grilled octopus salad, smokey tendrils drizzled with sweet oil, makes a nice opening though the meaty Dungeness crab salad is overwhelmed by mayonnaise
Revel in the velvety, buttery Chilean turbot; cheaper, but just as pleasing, is the artfully plated citrus sea bass, filleted at the table
Never have seen the dining room upstairs, and to be honest, do not want to after mowing down half the menu in the Shack
Simple, tastey and fresh are the best ways to describe
Service WAS a bit slow, and its not CHEAP- but you are in NYC, so either deal with it or get takeout and stay home
Fun for anything from bringing the wife, to a (nonstuffy) client, to ripping open some crab legs with a good bud
My most recent trip to BLT Fish was the best yet
Everything from the warm greeting I received at the door to the great desserts and port wine at the end of the meal made for a truly grand experience
I couldn't have asked for a better night out
The tuna tartare was perhaps the best I'd ever had, and the Cantonese crispy red snapper was delicious
It has a beautiful dining room as well
It's fun and luxurious without being stuffy
This restaurant is way out of my price range, but when I received a gift certificate, there was no way I could refuse! We ate in the upstairs dining room on the third floor
I don't eat fish so I got the rack of lamb - the only choice for non-fish eaters
It was delicious
My coworkers had fish and loved it
The sides were yummy and the service was excellent
It is definitely an expensive restaurant - $200 for 3 people, so I could not go back but for one night, I'm glad I went
We had both types of clam chowder - The New England Chowder tasted like celery soup: it had no clam taste
And the Manhattan Clam Chowder had no thyme in it, and would have passed for a nice vegtable soup
The crab cakes were small and tastless
Fortunatly, the oysters were good, but then again they come from the sea, not an incompetent kitchen
My friend and I were walking looking for another restaurant when we stopped at BLT Fish and decided to eat there instead
We had a drink at the bar and waited 30mins before seated at a table
We ordered a lobster roll, fried shrimp and chips- afterwards for dessert the banana cream pie
The food was bland nothing amazing
As we were eating our bland banana cream pie, and before I was even served my cappuccino
The manager came over and dropped the check on our table - RUSHING us out
We couldnt believe it as we had only been seated for 30mins and we WAITED 30mins for a table
How dare they rush us out the door! My friend complained and we were not charged for the pie
I never received the cappuccino I ordered
We were so insulted that we quickly paid and left
I will NEVER return
After getting seated 20 minutes after our reservation of 9:30 (to their credit, they did ask the people who where dawdling to go to the bar
after 20 min of waiting), 3 of us ordered appetizers to split
Get this - the Shrimp cocktail is only 3 shrimp
3! The best is the 18 dollar single crab cake
Total joke
We felt like we where getting beat bad here cuz we where
This was in the fish shack no less, not the fancier upstairs
Had the lobster roll for dinner which was excellent but again small
Good, but simply not worth the money
1 friggin tiny crab cake for 18 bucks still has me shaking my head
Come on guys!
The food and presentation were tres excellents! We had the pink snapper and the alaskan char, which were both simply succulent and delicious
Very well prepared
The service was impeccable
I never had to ask once for a refill and the waitress was always willing to answer questions and was very unclear, which I find is a rarity when I dine
This restaurant is an overpriced, poser hangout that employs discourteous people
We were completely rushed through our meal
So much so, that we had at least 3 different members of the staff come over to take our plates away (while we were still eating)
As we attempted to digest our meal and browse the dessert menu, the same staff members approached us to move along our order
Our check practically came with our dessert and again, they kept coming over to see if we had settled the bill
They might as well have brought us our coats at the table

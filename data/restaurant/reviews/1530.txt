etc
and tried Kang Suh for the first time last night
Kang Suh is by far the best BBQ and the pan chan are varied and fresh
It may be slightly more expensive than other K-town restaurants, but for the quality, this is my new favorite Korean place! The service is also very friendly, helpful and attentive
Joomeluk and bulgogi were excellent and the standard jap chae and mandoo were well above average!
I came here with my boyfriend for new years eve dinner and was very skeptic of this place at first because it didn't seem to be very friendly
But the service was great and very friendly
The Korean food especially the BBQ was well worth it but I suggest sticking to the beef and pork
The chicken seems kind of bland to my taste buds
The staff was very helpful in the BBQ-ing process if this is your first time
Parking is also available in the parking lot right next door to the restaurant so don't be afraid to drive there
If you have a few extra dollars to spend why not spend it here?
We went to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and needed a place to eat
We checked on Citysearch and found this restaurant
There were 13 of us, including 4 children under the age of 4
They put us in a private room
The service was fast, they were friendly and the food was delicious
If you come to NY and want Korean food, this is the place!
The food at Kang Suh is good, go! I never complain of the food there unless to say I wish I could eat more
My group of 3 ordered a seafood soup, a beef dish, a shrimp dish, and wine
They were all very tasty and good sized portions
Although the price may be a couple of dollars more than the other restaurants in K town, I think this is one of the better ones and worth the little extra money
Also the BBQ bulgogi and kalbi are very good!
I have eaten at many Korean resturants in NY
This one has the best food
Generous portions, fair prices
The fried hot peppers are amazing (forgot the Korean name for this dish)
So far, everything I've ordered has been excellent
I've been coming to this restaurant since '97
I'm Korean and I am picky when it comes to Korean food
I have tried other restaurants in K town (Korea Town) in Manhattan, but I love Kang Suh, so I can say that at least I have tried other places and I can compare
I always bring non-Korean friends here who love the food and service
For large groups they have private rooms which is great
Pricewise, it's not cheap but it's not too expensive either if you consider all the food that you get
And because I have been such a long time customer, they give me extra dishes as courtesy
This is my favorite Korean spot
I've been coming here for years and I have never been disappointed
Plus having a parking garage right there helps
Open 24 hours is also a plus
If you love Korean food or want to try it, check out Kang Suh
I'm usually too apathetic to fill these forms out
Even if I ABHOR a place, I'm not moved to leave an opinion
However, I am SHOCKED that I will only be the 2nd person to leave a review of Kang Suh!!! I've known about this place since I moved here my back in the 1900s ('97)
Although it has that non-intimate diner feel to it, that's almost part of its appeal
I'm not Korean, (my best friend is), and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here!!!! You can't go wrong with the barbecue items, the absolute best being the Joomeluk (Choomaluk, spelled many ways) and my best friend loves the soups and Bi Bim Bap
That they even offer Joomeluk shows that they take the bbq part of their menu seriously
It's pricey, yes
It's NYC! But for such high-quality meat, it's well worth the trip and expense
Seems like all the Korean BBQ around here is really expensive unless you hit Kum Gang San for the weekday lunch special
If I'm gonna pay this much for dinner though, I'll take Kang Suh over KGS
Kalbi was incredible, bulgogi nice, chap chae appetizer okay but nothing special
The first time I came here, the staff was kinda pushy to get our table when we finished (guess I can't blame them since it was so busy/full), but last week it wasn't so bad
great party room on 2nd level open bar with great food only about 35 dollars,great staff ,great food,very friendly neighborhood bar, very reasonable
Best bar in NYC! The drinks are great, the bartenders are friendly and fun, and one always feels at home
Great jukebox too!!!
I have been going to this place for the past few years
It's your typical neighborhood spot
but I have met my best friends here
It is definitely one of those places where you feel at home
The staff is wonderful, the drinks are great and the price is reasonable
It's not the hot new spot
but it's one of my all time favorites
A place to relax with friends, have a great hamburger
just wonderful
An oasis in the heat!
The Scene Just an occasional carving or wall-hanging spruces up the plain, large, but nicely proportioned dining room; a TV showing Chinese films presides from a central perch
Quick, no-frills service matches the modest atmosphere
Expect a wait at peak times
The Food Although the menu covers popular bases with "American Chinese food" and stabs at Shanghainese favorites like soup dumplings, the core competency here is the pungent, hot Sichuan cooking
A marinated salad of raw garlic, savory melon and piquant green peppers starts the meal with a bang
Continue with perfect garlicky eggplant or top-notch dry-sauteed string beans, both excellently fresh and handsomely presented
Farm-raised chicken, fresh-killed, is a specialty here, and its fuller flavor makes a marked difference in everything from chili-heaped "Chong Qing" chicken to familiar kung pao
For those who shirk spice, options abound, including gingery, full-flavored pork or tofu and fine, crisp scallion pancakes
There are very few restaurants in NYC offering authentic Chinese food at better prices
Not the perfect restaurant to go on a date, but definitely worth checking out
Definitely not what it used to be
What was once one of the only truly worth the wait dining experiences in the city, has sadly become quite disappointing
Compacted with the long lines, terrible service, and mediocre food, I give a thumbs down
Real shame
Don't go!! The food was awful, and the 'so-called' meat was unspeakable
Service was rude as well
Just wondering how anyone could give positive reviews about this place!?!?
I used to like Gran Szechuan for its affordable, fresh, yummy Chinese food
However over the years the service (which was never its crowning point to begin with) has gotten surlier and surlier, especially, frankly, to non-Chinese patrons
They act like you're being an annoyance when you try to flag a waitress to do the normal things you'd want a waitress to do, like take your order and bring you chopsticks or water or tea or your check
And the quality of the food has also gone down
It used to be worthwhile, but now it's just annoying
Good soup dumplings though
I came to Grand Sichuan for my birthday with 10 friends on a Saturday night
With most other places that claim to be able to handle big group (Tony Di Napoli for one) you can't expect much on a Saturday night
Well Grand Sichuan was a different story
We were sitted right away and had constant good service
The food was delicious
Try the fried dumplings for an appetizer! The desert they gave me for my bday was a little strange but still a nice thought
The best Chinese food
Mapo tofu is best I've ever had
However the hostesses are very rude
The service is whatever
I would recommend going only for great chinese food
Or opt for take-out instead

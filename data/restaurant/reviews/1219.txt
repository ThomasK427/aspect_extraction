The sirloin melts in your mouth
The hostess welcomed us to her home and the that is what we felt
we were home
A+
In Short At this Upper East Side bar and restaurant, it's both the dinner and drinks that reel in the well-heeled clientele
Art deco style, skylights and a streetside patio set the gabby who's-who scene of posh Europeans and young Manhattan singles
A New American menu complements the upscale bistro, as do over 100 international vodkas, as many wines and a few frozen cocktails served by bartenders in slinky blue dresses
If you love vodkas 212 is the right place
We went there last wednesday, hang out at the bar and sip a few vodkas
We tried the amazing van gogh flavored vodkas as well as a few Russians ones that were highly recommanded by the babe behind the bar
We then met a group of friends and had a great dinner (amazing veal milanese and chicken!)
Great atmosphere and great crowd!
I so wanted to love this place, I finally went for dinner
The inside was really nice, the staff was friendly and fairly attentive
The food was just ok
Nothing wrong with it, but very plain and definatley not worth the money
I don't mind paying a high price for a really good meal, but this was really average food
It was a Friday night and half the place was empty
I doubt this restaurant is what it used to be
Don't think I'd return
Not only 212 is very far from being what it used to be, but the italian woman at the door makes it worse
don't ask her anything because she knows absolutely nothing and if she gets a little bit busy then you won't see her again
then she will get an attitude and tell you she's the owner
scary!!! We walked out and she encouraged us not to come back
she was completely lost when the restaurant wasn't even full
but don't you dare saying something bad to her because she's the boss
we will never go back there and make sure our friend won't either
that's ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This restaurant has it all
Great vodkas and cocktails, hot bartenders, great food, reliable and friendly service, great atnosphere and a lot of celebrities
212 should open in LA
Favorite spot to go and enjoy a night out
Food is so good AND the ambiance is really hot
Love the staff, very friendly and enjoy the outside terrace
Amazing place
The vibe is incredible, the food is fantastic and the service great
One of the spot is New York to my taste
Cool place, great vibe, great vodkas, good menu, great looking bartenders
excellent service
Between the sub-par food (I've had better smoke salmon from Costco) and horrific wait staff (sure
you'll be a famous actor one day), I couldn't help but think, what the hell am I doing here? The all-men crew was not appealing at all
These wannabe actors/waiters could not be any more pretentious
I've had better service in Chinatown! We gave a 13% tip and they had the nerve to ask for more?? Are you kidding me?
My boyfriend took me to 212 last Friday night for dinner
I was wowed by this place! The atmosphere is very pristine; white tablecloths, white chairs, spark walls
The drink menu is fun and extensive which explains the crowd at the bar
I had a Monte Carlo and my boyfriend a mojito-style drink and we loved it! Appetizer of smoked salmon crepes was small but tasty
My boyfriend loved his lamb burger (a bit heavy for my taste but it had a great flavor!) and I was thrilled with my seared tuna and arugula salad
Even our dessert of chocolate souffle was delightful
To top it off, our server was attentive and kind even though the place was bustling! Last note: the restaurant is VERY loud so don't expect an intimate conversation here! Instead, sit back and enjoy the beautiful people (a very Euro crowd) and festive atmosphere
On a recent visit to New York City from Los Angeles, our concierge recommended 212 for a fun night
Fun it was
Great cocktail and vodkas, fantastic menu choices and very good food
The atmosphere was great and the crowd very euro
Great looking bartenders
This restaurant can seem like a find on a good night
Unfortunately, I've seen its true colors
The waitstaff is great
However, its obvious that management has no knowledge of how to service a highly demanding clientele
When a guest had a glass of wine dropped on her, management didn't offer to reimburse her or even apoligize
The tables are too close together in the claustrophobic and uninviting main area
The lighting and decor are actually very tasteful
Insist on sitting in the very rear
The quality of food was sufficient, with simple dishes that clearly depend on the freshness of the ingredients
The wine selection, while good, is terribly overpriced
Drink at home
All in all, I do not recommend this restaurant and I have no plans of going back
I can only guess that the large number of positive comments are the regurgitations of the undemanding
I really enjoy the cozy/sexy atomosphere and its not too crowded so you can actually hear the person you are speaking to
Great to for drinks
Nothing bad to say about the place
I eat at 212 all the time, and it's always a quality experience
Delicious food, good service, nice neighborhood crowd
If you're friendly to them, they're friendly to you
We booked a reception for a surprise party and everything was great as planned
I was a bit nervous at first but the food came out perfect, the service was good and friendly and the ambiance was exceptional
This place is for sure one of the best in new york
We were told we had to try it
if not for the food, for the bloody marys
We were not disappointed
Everything was fantastic
Only, don't go during those weird hours
not quite brunch anymore
definately not dinner, yet
The service was super until the very end
Having to ask the waitress for coffee and the check four times is unexcusable, not mention, unforgettable
We had lunch outside the other day where we chose the price fix
a steal for $18
50
The food was excellent and the service helpfull
As for the outdoor they dont take reservation so you might have to wait 20 minutes to be sat
I've been to 212 twice
Once on a date and once with my bf
The lobster salad pictured on this site is sooo expensive
I got the appetizer portion which is like the size of my pinky and it cost me over $20!! And when i tried to ask him how much it was he just said
oh I don't know and hesitatingly said I could check but didn't do it
The service is HORRIFIC! Our waiter was so pretentious and busy talking to the trendy French party next to us that he didn't even look at us twice, ask how our meal was, whether we wanted anything
NOTHING at all
Do not waste your time here
We went to 212 restaurant for our annual Mother's Day Brunch

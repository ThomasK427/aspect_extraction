Sometimes you read a review and are grateful that you weren't there the night the reviewer was
My dear Mademoiselle, Paradou isn't a place for Upper East Side diletantes
It is a place that for the year plus that Ive been going there continues to serve great food that is not dumbed down as is done in most bistros
The waiters ranging from the incredibly convivial to the slightly, but comically surly
, always deliver great, knowledgeable service
And now with springtime, Paradous garden is a fabulous hideaway
Paradou is the kind of small out of the way place, that continues to prove why New York is a food town
Perhaps youd be more comfortable in places like Meet or Pastis
Oh and by the way, the huge takeout container is the standard clamshell youd get in most places, but perhaps it was too large to fit into your Prada bag
The food in this bistro was fantastic but the service was authentically French
Overall a recommended night out and a definite European reminder
I love relaxed French-Euro-style bistros and Paradou is a newly found favorite
Not fancy, just really really nice, good food - everything from crepes to pressed sandwiches and a great wine selection! Attentive but relaxed service
A place I definitely will return to
Very personable owner and staff
Excellent wine selection and interesting variety of dishes
Great selection of pate
I was with a group of 6 and the space could probably accommadate 25 seated comfortably
Our waiter was incredibly attentive, well-versed in the menu, and made great wine and food recommendations
If you are looking for a little charm, authentic French cuisine without pretention, skip Pastis and go here (but let's keep this our secret!)
I just tried Paradou for the first time and I was very pleased with everything
Whoever said that the portions weren't big didn't try the special asparagous stew in phyllo dough
It was huge and delicious! I couldn't finish it all but I definitely tried
The waitstaff was friendly and funny and they all seem very proud of their place
They made me feel like one of the family
Seated right away, outgoing friendly hostess, prompt service, great selection and price, enjoyed the atmosphere, we had two carafes of wine and they complimented an additional one, we really had a comfortable dinner and will return soon
Welcoming, delightful and delicious - my new favorite
The food is authentic Provence, yet inventive, and the atmosphere is charming
Went to Paradou after two lousy attempts at other hot spots
Kathleen really made our night! We ate outside (it was a little chilly, but nice)
Had great service, great food, great wine, and a great atmosphere
Can't wait to go back
We enjoyed our dinner completely
Our waiter was very informed about the wine list and menu and answered all our questions
He suggested fantastic chocolate truffles for dessert as well
We will be back- soon!
I had been meaning to go to Pardou for a while and feel in love with the atmosphere as soon as I walked in the place only to be sneared at by the servers
To their credit they did warm up as the meal prgressed
As for the food, it is light and well balanced
It is not a place to bring cornfead midwesterners, but I am looking forward to the chance to taste the crepe with truffle oil again soon
Tasty sandwiches, and great wine
But they actually have kicked us out after we've been there 'too long' Less than attentive service from one of the waiters
But in all, a good place
nice place to bring a date
very small and cute, but in such a cool neighborhood
the menu is a little lacking for solid entree dishes for big eaters, but the wine selection is good and the owner (who helped serve because it was busy) was really nice
paradou is a true find
i've been going there for several months and continue to enjoy it thoroughly
the menu is very interesting and tries very hard to stay true to its french/mediterranean infulences
the wine list is surprisingly extensive for a place this size and the vast majority of the wines are available by the glass
the service, a great point of contention amongst the reviewers here, is certainly unique
all of the waitstaff are certainly charaters and worth getting to know
can they cop an attitude? Yes
but this is new york
if you want attitude free service, the local diner is the place to go
most of the time, the waitstaff adds considerably to the paradou experience
and lest i forget, the garden
ah the garden
a true paradise
quiet, leafy, charming, romatic
paradou is a great place
not perfect, but what is
have been a paradou regular from vrtually the first week
it is definitely a refuge from the pretensious service and subpar food that i find in most restaurants located in hot neighborhoods
the food and wine while not inexpensive continue to be some of the greatest values in town
the garden is truly an enchanting place
you quickly forget youre in new york
the service, which, at times can be spotty (where is it not), is always entertaining
ive gotten to know the people who work there and the owner and they all view being at paradou with mesianic ferver
they truly care
this restaurant has been open for less than a year, so they are still working out some bugs
try to be forgiving of the imperfections, as they do get so many things right
It is the best little find in the city! Delicious well priced food
Sexy, quiet back garden
When the hits the restaurant guide books next year forget it
But for now
enjoy but shhh don't tell
Paradou is a great local secret
great sandwiches and salads and an intreguing wine list
ask for the reserve list which is undoubtedly the best value-for-exceptional wines in manhattan
hip location and clientelle without being posey
smack bang in the middle of the meatpacking district it has all the edge without any of the pretension
best of all is the wonderful backyard garden with it's jack and the bean stalk cliff walls
great for cosy intimate dates or with a racous wine-knowledged crowd
I went there with a group of people and we sat in the tiny garden on very uncomfortable seats
the waiters were extremely rude and acted too cool to be serving
They acted as if a group of more than 6 were too annoying to deal with, so they didn't even pass the menus down nor the waters and never checked back to see if we needed anything else
The food was okay if not bland
Just bland panini sandwiches and crepes
The beet salad was pretty good
A very limited menu
Nothing great at all
This place is a little bit too tiny and the seats are so uncomfortable
But despite all of this, the atmosphere is cozy and the staff was very pleasant
At one point my friend knocked over a glass and broke it to pieces, and the waitstaff was so forgiving of it
Food was very good - and the chocolate was divine!
The place is wonderful
It's tiny inside, but nice
The backyard is adorable, with flowering bushes and strings of lights overhead
Is it Le Cirque? No, and it's not meant to be, but it certainly doesn't look like anyone's garage, as the last review suggested

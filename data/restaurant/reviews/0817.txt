The food was great, there is an Outdoor Garden, and a great bar menu
The owner is a real New Yorker who has served time in the military and can talk to you with your Mom, your partner, or a bunch of friends
More New Yorkers should be supporting this place
This is New York
I truly enjoyed ALEO from beginning to end
The food was fabulous, and truly well presented
Aleo is tucked away on 20th Street between 5/6 Avenues and is a true destination
The Outdoor Garden was a treat
We stumbled upon the place and are sure to go back again and again
the veal and the wine are my favorites at this small little northern italian restaunt
the atmosphere is like no other place i have been
the waitstaff is pleasant and helpful, the bartender is a kind, warm person and the manager was extremely generous
i would recommend this restaurant to everyone: first daters, parents with kids, as well as grandparents celebrating an anniversary
This restaurant has it all; I've eaten here several times and never been disappointed
Besides having a diverse menu of excellent choices and a great wine list, the staff aims to please
Each time you make a return visit, you feel more like one of the family
This spot is anything you need: romantic, business lunch, family meal or party
There is a great open-air courtyard in the back
And you stay as long as you like; no one is rushing you after you finish your meal like some restaurants do
Give this one a try; I promise you won't regret it
This is one of my favorite spots in NYC
The place has it all well presented/delicious food, great wine selection/drinks, an Outdoor Garden Oasis in the Back and a great staff owner
Our group were served a plate of dried sauasage, olives, cheese fresh baked bread with olive oil to dip in
I started with their house Pinot Noir to savor the antipasto
The Osso Bucco which was so tender and fell off the bone
The cheese tart appetizer was exceptional
The sausage broccoli rabe dish that was the best my brother ate
It is a treasure, so go discover this gem that is good for a business lunch or a Romantic evening
Go on their special wine nights next one is 6/21/05
Which treat you to an assortment of wine at an unbelievable price and value
To date I've been there six times and they never disappointed
Can't wait to go back
We sat in the rear garden until late in the evening had a fab dinner/drinks
Staff were friendly made us feel at home
Highly recommend the pumpkin ravioli
Most times you find a spot that is great for business or great on a date
It is very rare to find a place you can do both
The food and servce are top notch
The wine list is surprizing
And dining in the garden on a romatic evening in the city is perfect for that someone special
A true gem
You almost want to keep it for yourself
This place is an excellent choice, whether you need a place for a business meeting or a special date with someone this is it
A hard to find, family owned, wonderful atmosphere, with great food, Aleo takes the cake!
I had a very enjoyable culinary experience here
The food is superb, and the service exquisite
I truly felt relaxed and catered too
The people are genuine and the ambience is so soothing
I thoroughly enjoyed everything that was put on the table including the wine, which was recommended by the manager
The garden is so romantic
A true gem in the City, places like this are hard to find
Forget the Princess
I went to ALEO with a group of friends while at a convention in New York City
Someone recommended ALEO at the show
Everything was great
I had the mussels in a tomato broth that was delicious
Then, I had the steak, which was grilled to perfection
I finished with a chocolate lava cake that filled my sweet needs
We were 8 people, we drank a few bottles of wine
I say this because something I only heard about or seen in a movie happened next
A manager or someone stopped at the table and asked if we would like a complimentary after dinner drink
Well, seven glasses were placed on our table, and a bottle of port as well as a bottle of lemoncillo, for us to drink at will (Family style we were told)
Check ALEO out
The food was top shelf
WE WERE HAPPY
Listen, this place is in the middle of all the big boys in Gramercy, and the food is right there with these big guys
This food is the real deal!!! The staff is young, but always willing to go the extra mile and make you feel at home
It is like Mom or Dad is in the kitchen telling your friend to make sure their guest eats
All I can say is I tried it on Valentines Day via Open Table, with my girl, and we have been back twice since
The people here make you feel like they really want you to be here, and if you talk to them they only make you feel better
Oh, did I say the food is terrific
My husband and I came for dinner
We were seated and although the restaurant was far from full, nobody came to our table for a FULL 15 MINUTES to even take a drink order
Finally, when a guy brought bread over, I asked him for a waiter and that's how we finally got one
Each round of drinks took over 10 minutes (we were drinking somewhat complicated martinis)
My food would have been good if it hadn't been cold
I refused to get dessert
I'll never return
Went there as a group of four prior to going out to a bar on New Years night
The atmosphere is both inviting and cozy
Service is splendid, makes you feel like you're truly appreciated as a customer
Each dish was a thoughtful and delicious creation
One of the best restaurants in New York!
Hooray, Hooray, for 20th Street
ALEO is the place
This place is on the same block that is home for some of the best known restaurants in NYC
ALEO is prime time
The real deal for the food, and the people there are so genuine
You will not see the pomp and circumstance in the higher priced places, rather ALEO's prices are so reasonable, while the food competes with the best of them
The wine list is the most sane one we have seen in a while
Got to try it
Aleo Restaurant, my new favorite, has managed to rival my previous neighborhood choices such as Beppe and Arezzo by providing delicious food at appropriate prices in an atmosphere that truly feels comfortable
Whereas many of the Flatiron District's upscale restaurants tend to treat customers with icy politeness while providing hyped menu selections not worth their salt , Aleo's sincere greeting and creative food choices provide a marked contrast
Aleo's warm environment encourages you to savor, linger, and simply enjoy
Their menu is original
The combination of traditional Mediterranean fare with Middle Eastern nuances in dishes such as the lamb chops, the lifeguard stew and field green salad are wonderful
This restaurant is a winner all around
I advise you to try it and see for yourself
I've been at Aleo's a couple of times with family members, and friends, and we have always had a remarkable time
The food is innovative, and extremely tasteful

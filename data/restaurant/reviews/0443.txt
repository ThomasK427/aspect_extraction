The Scene Bette Midler is the big name behind this novel venture: a chi-chi yet rustic restaurant housed in a renovated 1933 Fort Tryon Park facility
The clientele is an attractive mix of locals, curious downtowners and tourists visiting the nearby Cloisters, but the main attraction is the spectacular view: the park on one side, the Bronx on the other--the latter best experienced from the outdoor patio
The Food Considering that the money goes to a good cause--the upkeep of the park--it would be nice if the food were more adventurous, or, at the very least, better
Although the menu constantly changes, staple dishes include mundane grilled filet of salmon, roasted chicken, filet mignon and burgers, decently delivered at midtown prices
If you pop by for brunch, order the mixed basket of fresh muffins, easily the most impressive part of the meal
Unfortunately for being such a good looking restaurant in a beautiful location it fails to deliver
Nothing about the menue struck me
The service was terrible
We waited about 15 min
at the door for a hostess to show up than 45 minutes for a table
Our waiter didn't greet us until about 20 minutes and by that time we had enough
we walked out
will never go back again
Here is a restaurant that having reached a nice level of success is now becoming more and more complacent and the service is becoming so casual to the point of being rude
Last night we (a group of 6) went for dinner and were seated at 8:25 pm
At 9:00 pm we were asked what we'd like to drink, at 9:25 we received the drinks, and at 9:30 the menus
by 9:45 we received a bun and a bit of butter, and by 10:25 we were served dinner
And the food was cold
All of this for $198
00 per couple!  Good thing we were enjoying each other's company
I don't know how soon I will go back to the New Leaf Cafe'
Having dined at New Leaf on several ocassions for different meals, I can firmly state both the food and service are above par
The brunch, as many have mentioned, is particularly good
Be careful, however, to make reservations and confirm they will be honored the day of your visit
To be frank, the management seems inept when it comes to keeping records of their future guests
On more than one ocassion I've opted for another restaurant in the area because they didn't honor my reservation (or couldn't seat me for another half hour past my reservation time
What would be the point of having a reservation?)
I've also had the experience of calling for a reservation and never hearing back
So, make the trip, wet your appetite for some lovely food in a romantic locale, but beware
you might end up eating somewhere else
The food is delicious and the setting is incredibly romantic
It's worth the trip up
Weekend brunch is always good, if you can get in, and the bloody mary's and mimosas are exceptional
Reservations are recommended
New Leaf Cafe is a great hidden find
The chef who came from Gramercy Tavern and 21 really knows how to put together great tasting, unique dishes with a twist
The homemade parpadelle with duck is excellent as are the diver scallops with seaweed salad
The wine list is nice as well
There is live Jazz on Thursday evenings
The building where the restaurant is located feels like a lodge in the mountains and is very airy and open and the setting in the Park makes it very cosy in the winter and refreshing in the summer
New Leaf Cafe is a delightful uptown retreat
Beware of hour-plus waits without a reservation, but also consider sitting at the bar, where you can take casual refuge after a long week downtown (or anywhere below 190th street!) As a Washington Heights resident, this is one of my favorite spots to unwind with a friend
Best dish: wild mushroom risotto
Stay away from: appetizer ceviche - typical trendy attempt at Peruvian favorite - but the smallest portion I have ever seen - just 3 tiny slices!
What a cool place! Nice people, good wine, easy menu with great food, and what a neat little stone building in the middle of a green park
you would never know you were in the big city
A real gem
For all those NYers who are on the eternal search for a cool new place to impress someone
its well worth the trip uptown on the A Train
It still remains virtually unknown
Combined with an afternoon in Fort Tryon Park and/or The Cloisters, dinner at the New Leaf is the cap to a truly unique NYC experience
Anyone can do downtown or the upper west side
boring
While the service is not excellent the staff is extremely friendly and charming (I'll take that over efficient service but snobby and arrogant staff)
The New Leaf is a pleasant change from the normal Manhattan dining experience
The place is very cute, stone, dark wood and paper sconces all set in a very beautiful park setting
The bar is very inviting and I understand they have live jazz every Thursday night
The indoor dining room is almost as nice, but I would steer clear of the outdoor dining patio
Essentially just a tent over a shale/stone floor
The food is good (not great) but considering that the most expensive dish is $20 (NY Strip with Garlic Mashed Potatoes) - it makes it a little more pleasant
Salads are good and I would recommend the Lobster Cannelloni
Wine by the glass is reasonably priced and there's a good selection
Bottles are at the low to midrange and reasonable
All in all a great little getaway without really leaving Manhattan
As a resident of Washington Heights, I have to say that this is the best thing uptown! After running by the restaurant one day and noticing the beautiful setting, I was convinced to come back for a quiet dinner
The charm of this semi-rustic / modern restaurant comes from its location in one of the best parks in the city
There are no cars that honk or crowds flanking by the window, allowing for a quiet and relaxed dining
The service isn't over-the-top, leaving you alone most of the time to enjoy the environment
Food was above average and well-presented, but nothing extraordinary
Vegetarians will have a hard time, especially if you don't eat dairy
The Scene Named for Prohibition's notoriously elusive rum-running ship, this quiet, hidden refuge within Murray Hill's Park South Hotel still slips under the radar
A collection of stormy sea paintings and two mermaid figureheads hoisting lights above the bar set a lulled maritime mood
Mature businessmen and dates converse over hushed, white-clothed tables, and the library-like calm of the fireplace lounge lures solace-seekers toting books
Live jazz brings bustle to the bar on weekends
The Food The upscale seafood menu draws on Asian influences, with European hints and American helpings
To start, lightly brothed chowder conceals sunken chunks of clam, while blue cheese and pecans burst from sweet frissee and pear salad
Surf-and-turf encompasses the menu's star entrees: deliciously charred sesame-crusted tuna with ginger ponzu gently juxtaposes espresso-rubbed filet mignon
Tri-colored vegetable pasta sits in a less-inspired garlic sauce
But servers, attentive if slightly unpolished, gladly direct inquisitors to menu strengths--like rum-flambeed dessert bananas foster--and allow leisurely enjoyment
Never written a review before, but after Black Duck accommodated our last minute Saturday night reservation, I had to
The service was friendly and timely, the food was great
I had the Surf Turf which had a perfect portion of filet and seared tuna and my fiancee had the striped bass which was lite yet flavorful
Ambience was cosy and romantic and the live jazz was a nice touch and not overpowering
A new favorite
and the price was right
shared appetizer and 4 glasses of wine
$100
I have lived in Gramercy for four years and have never been to the Black Duck, or even heard of it
I happened upon it after work this past Monday by accident and ended up staying for the entire happy hour and then stayed for dinner
The bar was amazing, and surprsingingly full for a Monday night
It has a beautifully lit marble surface, a fabulous bartender (named Matt or Marc?), excellent drinks and specials and great food
The bar bites weren't anything special (we had calamari and wings, very ordinary), but our dinner was phenomonal, as was our service
The bartender is almost excessively knowledgable, and their wine list is small but decent
Go for the Surf and Turf or the Strip Steak
Anyway, I don't know why this place is such a secret
The decor isn't sleek, but it's background
My girlfriend and I are now hooked!
We had planned a night in the city for my friends birthday we booked a room at the giraffe hotel
We got to the hotel around 9:30pm they were overbooked so they sent us around the corner to the Park South Hotel which we never heard of so we were annoyed but when we got to the hotel it was actually nice
While checking in we heard live music so we asked where it was coming from they told us from the restaurant

We also found out that there's automatic 20% service charge for parties of 6 or more, even though the service was extraordinarily bad
That info
wasn't even on the menu as it should have been
Appetizers are very tasty, main courses are OK
Sangria was severely watered down
our group of 12 was seated immediately in the private room upstairs by the friendly waitstaff
the food was amazing and warmed our bellies on a cold winter night
the mac and cheese was scrumptious, pork chops fat and juicy, creme brulee perfectly crisp and delightful
if you are looking for a great meal @ a great price, tenement will surely satisfy
I was really impressed with the interior because the front and entrance was so small and narrow - but the hostess led us into the back and sat us in a beautiful little room with a fireplace
My boyfriend and I were starving and grateful for the immediate service and attention from our laid back server
I had the grilled red snapper, an excellent low-carb dish, it was lite and full of flavor
And my boyfriend was happy with his grilled pork chop served with succotash (I'd never heard of it before- but this mixture of corn and lima beans was really good)
Dinner was delicious
Went there with a reservation for 10 people
Our table was not ready so they made us wait an hour even though there were plenty of open tables they could have rearranged
They were rude, never apologized for making us wait and were not thoughtful enough to send anything over to the table after we were seated
I would never go there again!!!!!!!!
The old saying that bad service can ruin even the best meal is proven at this restaurant
We had an excellent meal, and the place has a great vibe and incredibly affordable prices
Too bad our waitress ignored us the entire time (the table next to us went to the bar to get their own drinks b/c the waitress never even spoke to them) and it ended up taking almost 2 hours for us to eat an appetizer and entree
When we complained to the manager, he told us that we have 2 big parties in the back, and I told our waiters it was going to be slow
Excuse me, but having big parties is not an excuse to ignore customers, especially if the waitress serving you is covering the front of the room, where the parties are not located
Not sure if I'd go back after this experience
My boyfriend I went here last night
Although the place wasn't so packed, the service kinda sucked because the server was so laid back/slow
But the food made up for it
I ordered two apps - potato pancakes the pierogies
He ordered the fried chicken
I don't like fried chicken, but it was delicious
The ambiance was great
And they have a really cool outdoor seating area in the back
We will definitely be back again!!
I invited 25 friends for a cocktail party to celebrate my boyfriends 30th b-day at Tenement
We reserved the room with the fireplace and began the evening with a sit down dinner for 12 of us
I highly recommend the duck breast because the cherry sauce is so unique (my boyfriend loved it) and the spiced pork chop was delicious - I've never tasted pork that was this moist
Serving size was a bit larger than I expected but everything was nicely prepared and presented on our plates
Everyone was happy with dinner
After dessert we went to the bar and the owner bought us a round of shots - while the staff was converting our private dining room into a lounge (they took out the dinner tables replaced them with coffee tables)
The room is so cozy - a great choice for a special get together
The atmosphere was relaxed for the Tuesday night we dined there
I expected much more from the impressive menu items, but dish after dish was disappointing
Champagne poached pears were awfully spiced and walnut cheese tased like Laughing cow cheese with nuts, mozzarella from app
was very chewy and plantain crusted snapper was way-over battered
New special:mushroom ravioli was only thing really worth eating
One word: Uninspired
I really enjoyed my dinner here
My friend and I were in the back room with the fireplace, and it was really gorgeous
However, the crowd near the bar was a little bridge and tunnel
But, the food was indeed good
I remember a lavender ice cream that was so unique
Delicious
Weird crowd though
Booked one of their rooms for a party of 20 people
Place sounded great -- they told us open til 4, bar is hopping
Night of, our waiter was rude and then stopped serving us at midnight
When I asked why, the manager said, Your waiter is only as good as his experience
Helpful
Then they turned on the lights at 1, kicked us out at 2
Skip this place -- there are too many good bars in LES to waste time with this one
I love what they have done to this place! The LES is becoming more and more charming
And this place is definitely at the head of the pack
At first the high chairs at the tables in the front room seemed awkward but it worked well with the rest of the restaurant
If you have a romantic date, sit in the rear dining room by the fireplace (very cozy)
Service was nice and attentive
Food was tasty and nicely presented
I really loved this place
The staff was very friendly, but i have to admit not very organized
But the food made up for everything
The duck is delicious
It's so tender it practically melts in you mouth
They also have great unique apetizers
You must give this place a try
i loved tenement! i had my boyfriend's birthday dinner there 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time
i reserved the upstairs section, which was absolutely perfect space for our group of about 10
the staff was extremely accommodating, esp
since we were about 15-20 minutes late and people were trickling in
the food was great, atmosphere was fabulous, no complaints! i will
I found Tenement to be a really relaxing, chill place to just chat and catch up with an old friend over cocktails
The place is really cozy and the waitstaff attentive without being intrusive
The menu has a nice spin to the typical lounge fare (mussels, spring rolls, pierogies) - everything is nicely presented and tasty
The only con would be that they don't have happy hour specials which would explain the lack of crowds during the work week
Great vibe,service, and at a not too steep price, Tenement is a place I want to return to anytime! Still haven't checked out the Upstairs lounge, but eager to do so
Shocked it wasn't more crowded
For anyone who gave Tenement a negative review, your standards must be so riduculously high that you're never satisfied
The decor is innovative and lush, without being overly pretentious, and the food and service definitely measure up
It's a guaranteed great time for all and no one should pass up an opportunity to try it out for themselves
I love this place
and I have to say that it's one of the best choices in the LES
great neighborhood
to hang
The price's are very reasonable, the food excellent, and the staff is very laid back and friendly
The design is Victorian/Modern
which is original
and the back rooms are great for groups or private interludes
I think this place is a gem and people need to be a little less harsh
Leave the attitude at the door
I've been here several times
with no problemas
Already one of my favorites in the area, Tenement has the elements of being one of those places that make you forget you're in the LES, but needs to pull it all together

However, we were always seated promptly
My only complaint is the prices
It's too bad that it's so expensive
However, I honestly think that this place is worth the try if you're willing to shell out a little more for some great sushi
The service was excellent and the food was delicious
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date
im an out of towner- did a tour of 20 sushi places
relatively speaking, haru is not bad
the cod is wonderful but the sashimi was sub-par
maybe it was just an off day
the location makes this palce convenient- i would go again
Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service
Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied
Don't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo
It's too bad that the two reviewers below had sub-par experiences because I've found that Haru's best place for lunch and after-work drinks/dinner around my office
It's where my colleagues and I take all of our clients - you get great food and atmosphere without getting ripped off!
I will never visit this restaurant again
Had been sitting with friends for about 2 hours, ordering food/drinks all the while, when we were suddenly presented with a check
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations
WTF? Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers
I haven't been to the other locations
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried
Will never be back
I love this place! I've been there 3x's, their 3rd Ave location, Park avenue Broadway/W 43rd St
location
Appetizer, I always get the Rock Shrimp Tempura with spicy cream sauce
Well, I'm Indian I like spice this is nothing for me compared to what I've had before
Then for my regular meal I normally get my usual, california roll boston roll
But my friends have had their alaska roll, their sashimi, their dragon rolls are so damn scrumptious
Their food in general is great! So, if you're a sushi lover/Japanese food lover, you should hit this spot
I'd definitely recommend going here with a date/loved one or a few friends, or whatever
Highly recommended
Very good food
We will go back next time we are are in New York
Went last night with my boyfriend, and was amazed
Sushi excellent, very big pieces, service great, nice 'ambiance' too
We were seated somewhat closely to another party, yet we didn't even notice
Price was excellent
came out to $70 for the two of us, we ordered a small appetizer and 5 amazing rolls that we didn't even come close to finishing! Special rolls more pricey of course, but great normal rolls in the $7-$10 range that were out of this world
Walked right in w/o reservations around 8pm on Sat
night
Definitely great bang for the buck!
I went to Haru Park for lunch with a co-worker
The service was very fast and the sushi special was very good
The fish was fresh and the presentation was great! Its reasonably priced for lunch
The wait staff is a bit curt and not as warm as you would hope, but it was very busy so it is to be expected
The only negatives I see are that the tables are VERY close together and it is extremely noisy
I eat here all the time, and had a big group dinner here for 18 people
They gave us our own area, and the food and service was terrific
The eggplant appetizer is unrivaled, and the sushi is terrific too
People are nice and the space is really cool
Great background music
Friendly management
Great strong drinks
Reasonably priced
AWESOME
GO HERE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHERE TO GO
The sushi and appetizers were very good and timed well
Service was prompt and managed a group of 10 easily
Only negatives were the hostess that was rude while taking reservations (twice with two different people) and the noise level in the restaurant
The atmosphere here is sophisticated without being pretentious and the service is excellent
Prices could be a smidge lower, but the food was good enough to get away with the cost - and the portions were LARGE
I was so excited when Haru came to midtown! No more having to drag myself up to the upper east side for good sushi
Furthermore, Haru is in the office building where he used to work so I have eaten here many a times! Great fresh tasting sushi is the bottom line!
What a nice surprise to stumble upon this great sushi restaurant in midtown
We've had a lot of sushi and the portions were big and the fish was fresh
Their special dish, Sushi for Two should be Sushi for FOUR
Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment
Here's to the fake fish tanks too
I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC
And that's no mean feat
The Scene The atmosphere at this hearty Murray Hill Mediterranean is as comfortable as a Brooks Brothers' blazer
Heavyweight mirrors, leather-lined chairs and abundant magnums of champagne set a robust tone
The Food The owners hail from Croatia's Dalmatian Coast, and some of the biggest winners on the menu highlight ingredients--like a wonderfully fragrant olive oil--culled from the region
Overall, the food is straightforward and gutsy
A simple toss of grilled portobella mushrooms, sweet Italian sausage, bell pepper, spinach and Gorgonzola is the sort of dish that easily becomes a once-a-month affair
Ravioli stuffed with salt cod, goat cheese, pine nuts and raisins is a must-have
And when dessert time rolls around, skip the sweets and head to the mahogany bar for a flight of fig- and herb-infused grappas
Food here was just to die for
I went here about two months ago and i loved it
now after work sometimes i go here for a bite
4 out of 5
could have better service
Must say the food was very good, and our server was outstanding
Fabulous dining experience
The food is prepared exactly right, it hits the spot and dazzles the senses, and it looks great on the plate! The portions are generous and there are many other yummy-sounding choices on the menu that I haven't seen at other restaurants
So, if you're into trying new things, this would be a good place to do it - I plan to return soon :-)  The restaurant is beautiful, lots of attention to detail and very elegant and clean
Service is friendly but relaxed and the prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the ambiance and amazing gourmet food
6 of us went here on a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday
It was lovely
From the welcome at the door, to the service being attentive, but not overbearing, to very end, when the piano player did a rendition of H
B
and sang! The duck was one of the best I've ever had! And the wine selection was extensive and reasonably priced
A wonderful find!! We will be back again!
With the very high rating of this restaurant, I expected it to be the best of the best, or a t least very good

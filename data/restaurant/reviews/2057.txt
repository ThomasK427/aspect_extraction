I must admit we were a little nervous after reading some of the other reviews, but they must have been written by the competition, because none of it was true
This place is the best
And I can't believe people were complaining about the price, $59 for 3 courses, where are these people from Kansas?
It's much nicer during the week, very busy on weekends
It's intimate, great food, impeccable service, lovely piano music
I've been in twice on weeknights and both times found myself dining next to celebrities (Ethan Uma and Kelly Ripa hubby)
It costs something like $60 a person for the prix fixed dinner which I found to be a bargain for the beautiful dining room and great food
The Scene Tucked away on a cute West Village corner, Blue Ribbon Bakery is noisy in a good way
People cram in here at all hours, but somehow it never takes too long to get a table
Wall-to-wall windows and mirrors on the bistro-style top floor make a relatively small space feel bigger
Downstairs, past the large baking furnace, there's a cozy red brick cellar space
Service is slightly harried, but attentive
The Food There's a trimmed-down version of the regular Blue Ribbon menu--all manner of sandwiches, and a solid selection of American main courses--but the real attraction is the vast, well-edited range of cheese, fish and vegetable portions (goodies like foie gras terrine aside, the meat selections are disappointingly indistinct)
Standouts include cream of tomato soup with just the right rich, smooth texture; delicately seared yellowfin tuna draped across thick cauliflower cream; and plump, plentifully stuffed mushroom ravioli pillows
I ordered the SHRIMP GARLIC CHORIZO and MUSHROOM RAVIOLI as an appetizer
Don't get it, it wasn't worth the money
For entree, I had the Filet Mignon and that was simply superb
The meat was tender, the potato latke was crunchy
it was amazing
The other stuff that we ordered, the hummus, the banana pudding, DONT GET IT
Only certain things are worth getting
If I were to go there again, I would just order the PROFITEROLES, three scoops of diff flavored ice cream wrapped in pastries and drizzled in chocolate---this was truly amazing
I'd forego the appetizers, none of them were good
Eat the free bread, it's one of the best parts of going to this restaurant
If you don't have any experience of restaurants you might, just, accept this miserable excuse of a place
The staff is surly, service is slow, the owner shouts orders to waiters across the place
The wine list has prices ranging from $33 (very very few choices) to $600 and more
The food is boring and the menu absurdly limited
Who, one wonders, would want to drink a $600 bottle of wine with any item on the food list
Give this place a miss
Need I say more? My meat was actually over-done (I ordered medium rare and it came out to be close to well-done) but as I was telling my husband, the manager walked up to us and asked how our food was
His eyes went straight to my meat, quickly walked off to check our order slip and came back to apologize to us and offered to get another one
What service! I actually didn't mind it at all so told him that wasn't necessary
My meal was free and we even got free dessert on the house
What a classy gesture!
Went there for brunch last weekend with a group of 10
They have a really cool private room that would seat about 8-13 people I would guess
It is in the wine cellar and right by the acutal ovens, which is kind of neat
Our waiter was great and very attentive - I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a group brunch! Definitely make reservations if you have a group large enough to
Everytime I go here I am never disappointed
I need to go more ofthen! Brunch, Lunch or Dinner it is always fantastic
The staff is amazing and super friendly
I couple of weeks ago we went to Supper in the east village and it was so bad that we got up and left and the only way to save the evening of horrible food was to go to Blue Ribbon Bakery and have at least one thing off the menu
If you don't like the food here you idea of fine dining is probably TGIF's and McDonald's
This place ROCKS!
I ordered a burger (medium), fries, and a glass of red wine
Glass of wine MIA
Meal came
I went to pick up one half of the burger, burger was so undercooked that the blood had seeped into the bun, the entire bottom of it soaked to where it could not be lifted
I lost my appetite immediately
Getting the attention of our server was impossible
Still no wine
Server arrived and said they wanted to give us a complimentary dessert
Great! We waited
No dessert
Check came
Charged for the wine
Told the waiter, he responded 'oh'
Still no dessert
Frustrated, hand the check back to the server and said 'by the way, never got the dessert and he said i did not realize you wanted dessert'
My friend and I looked at each other surprised how nonchalant the staff was about this horrible service they just gave us
Visited this spot last night for a birthday dinner
A group of 7 was taken care of nicely by our server
For starters the wine by the glass menu is short and weak
I had a few glasses of red and it was average at best
We skipped the apps and went straight to the main course
My girlfriend and I are vegetarians and there was a whopping 2 veg dishes to choose from, a grilled veg platter which I had, and for her the hummus platter
Mine very bland, served with rice that had no flavor
The hummus was ok, but it is not worth what they charge
Although I didn't have a bad time by any means, I just felt that for all the hype and the price tag the food should have and could have been a lot better
I had the mushroom ravioli which were very good but the striped bass was greasy and the accompanying vegatables were overcooked and soaked in butter
The caesar salad was flavorless
At this point, it seems like you're paying for the Blue Ribbon brand name and not the food
Time and time again I am amazed with The Bakery
The food and the service are always at perfection
It seems there may be one too many staff members and/or management on the floor but I suppose this is how they always manage to make sure everyone is happy with their experience
The last time I was there (last week) our food took a little too long and a manager promptly apologized and offered to comp our desserts (not expected but appreciated)
He then checked in on us after the food arrived, as did our server
My recommendation is this: Order tapas style then oreder the choclate chip breadpudding
Wines by the glass are lovely and if possible sit upstairs so you can watch the beautiful people pass by (windows, windows, windows)
What is so spectacular about this place? It's hard to pinpoint, but we keep returning about once a month
And we only order the SAME thing on the menu each time - it's hard to stray when the shrimp bacon hash is so damn good
Sometimes the service is good, sometimes it's not
Service is kurt and professional, albeit a bit boring
Waits can be daunting, but that's Sunday brunch in NYC, babe
I also wish their brunch menu was a bit more extensive
not much else to pick from, that's why we don't stray from the 'hash, but we love it!!
Tonight was our first time at BRB
The host was amazingly gracious! The server was only adequate
Loved the room the windows
The menu was great: tapas, cheeses, comfort dishes
The food did not disappoint - the grilled catfish steak were really yummy, ditto for the apps
No bread plates, though? Prices were a tad high
Still a nice place, though!
My group of 12 californians were looking to wine/dine one night and were recommended by many others to check out BR
We were seated in a very cozy and atmospheric cellar
I wasn't in the adventurous mood so i just had their NY Strip Steak which tasted mediocre
The thing i liked the most was the service
Both the waitress and owner were very hospitable
I wanted to try the foie gras terrine and bone marrow, but thought it was way too expensive

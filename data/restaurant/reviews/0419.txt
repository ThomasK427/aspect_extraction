Service is professional, if occasionally overbearing
The Food Extensive raw bar and sushi selections supplement the New American seafood menu
The kitchen is strongest in straightforward preparations, like a meaty crab cake with tomato aioli and a clam and lobster chowder with truffle-laced croutons
In other places, a surplus of ingredients creates dissonant results, like cumin-dusted tuna over squash, baby broccoli and fingerling potatoes or an otherwise excellent salmon with a parsnip puree, lentils, mushrooms and pesto
Desserts deserve notice, especially the apple cider cake and sour-cherry almond cake
This is one of the best seafood restaurant in town
We love to come here a lot
The food is so tasty and fresh of the seafood
My girlfriend and I went to the Blue Fin for her birthday celebration on Friday night
The waitress was superb and her recommendations were really thoughtful and truly delicious
I recommend the Blue Fin for couples on a romantic date, as well
Kudos to the Waitress in the Back Room on the Second Floor! She was attentive and did not rush us!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! One of my new, favorite places in Manhattan! Went there for a Blue Fin Martini before catching Toni and Tina's Wedding around the corner
We were a large group of friends that had a great time at the upstairs bar
The martini drinks were incredible
I also personally recommend the sushi and crabcakes (yum,yum)
Thank heavens we had something to eat at the Blue Fin, because the food was yuck at the wedding! It was pricey but worth it! I loved that you could sit and drink at the bar downstairs and people watch over time square or march upstairs to dine in their beautiful restaurant like you were a million miles away from it all
Can't wait to go back in June!  Dr
Cynthia Giruzzi-Cahill Delmar, NY
Elegant decor, great food, substantial wine list, MAGNIFICENT DESSERTS
Worth every penny! You must try Crme Brule -- its served with a demitasse spoon dipped in white chocolate
All the other deserts are great, too
Ive tried various dishes over time and was never even slightly disappointed
I took a gamble recently on this restaurant
I had 6 colleagues with me with VERY different tastes and food preferences
I had been to Blue Fin previously for drinks and appetizers and thought the atmosphere was very good (expecially for people watching)
As it turned out, all of us had xcellent meals and thoroughly enjoyed the experience
We even had a trainee waiter who had never waited on a table before
He did an excellent job
The service was prompt, friendly and VERY accomodating!   Sure it may be pricey
but what NY upper scale restaurant isn't
especially in a centralized touristy area like Time Square!!!!!!!  If you want a great dining experience with picky colleagues or even a group of friends
this is a great place to go for that total dining experience!
My wife and I had Tuna Tartar, Chilean Sea Bass w/roasted red peppers, and crusted Halibut w/feta gnocchi
The tuna tartar was flavorful and excellent, the olive relish was wonderful on bread
My wife raved about the sea bass, it was moist and cooked perfectly
I swooned over my halibut, but the feta gnocchi was almost as good
Our server, Christian, was extremely knowledgeable on wine, gave us several excellent options along with the bottle we selected
Dessert was also to die for, save room
With tip, we spent about $150 and didn't regret a penny; one of the best meals we've had
I went here with 3 girlfriends and we had a blast
when I first walked in to wait for my girlfriends arrival
I met two guys at the bar
the service at the bar was pretty decent
For dinner, I had salmon and friends had crab cakes and tuna which they raved about
personally, I can't say the food was that great but the atmosphere and cute guys was well worth the hefty tab
this time
Way too pricey for the bad service and small portions
Go to someplace off the beaten path away from Times Square
You'll be disappointed
Too many restaurants in NYC to waste time here
This is the place to take your out-of-town guests for a Martini while looking out at the Great White Way
Be sure to get their signature drinks as long as you're going to blow that kind of cash
If you stay for dinner, the crowd is somewhat tourist, and brave midtown regulars
Nice presenentation, decent meals, nothing to positively write home about
The food quality was mediocre for the price
I had the big-eye tuna (one of their most popular dishes according to the waitress) and was unimpressed
Veggies were lukewarm, the tuna itself was dry, and the whole think tasted of too much soy sauce
My wife had the raw sampler which was a real rip-off - 2 small shrimp, 2 crawfish, 4 oysters, a couple of small clams, and about a dozen dried out mussels, all for the value price of $75! Rediculous
Blue Fin is the best restaurant in Times Square
Very cool atmosphere, great menu (the lobster was awesome) and great service
I would highly recommend
Having eaten at may restaurants in this city, Blue Fin pales in comparison
The service was really sub par
When you have to chase your meal, it's annoying
Furthermore, there were mistakes and just general misteps (appetizer came before the drinks, wrong dish, bus boys grabbing plates that were still being eaten from)
This might be sort of forgivebale if the prices were not so high, but they are
I expect more, and get better in other similarly priced restaraunts
Not worth it
For $25 lunch entrees, you might expect better service
It was as if the waiter was above doing his job
I'm not normally too much of a complainer, but when you cant get your bread refilled after asking three times and have an hour and 15 minute lunch, you start to wonder what you're paying for
Modern, sleek and trendy this restaurant serves up excellent seafood and makes you wonder if you're really in Times Square
Prices here aren't cheap with mains around $26-28 and costly drinks
Eating here last night my friends and I ordered 2 appetizer dishes each, we shared some East West Oysters then I had the crab cake for a main
The appetizer portions are just that so if you're famished go for the main - we weren't and the meal was perfect
Other dishes ordered was the salmon, roll and caeser salad all of which were excellent
If I'm in Times Square looking for a dinner venue Blue Fin will be on the list
Very nice place to go AFTER the theater
Sushi was excellent
Try the BBQ eel
Great Manhattan from the bar
You can't fault them for serving up some pretty good food, even if it's a bit overpriced
But the place is overairconditioned to the point that if you sit on the upper deck, you have a better than average chance to catch a cold or at least dine on a side of AC condensation drops - no fun
Obviously a perennial problem, since they have a special sponge on a stick to try to keep diners dry
Didn't work with this one
The food was pretty average as was the service
However the sushi bar was a better option within the restaurant, and the front bar looking into Time SQ is good fun
Worth a visit and even worth going back
This place has some problems
1
Our napkins were damp
2
Our waiter forgot about us for long periods of time and never even offered us a dessert menu
(I'm fairly thin, so I don't think he was putting me on a diet
)  3
You have to tip a guy in the restroom if you want a paper towel to dry your hands
(A not uncommon, but disgusting practice
I will not return to any restaurant that does this
) 4

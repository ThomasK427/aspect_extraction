The crust here resembles a crispy biscuit (almost to the point of being too dry), and the filling is like vanilla creme anglaise pudding (very unique and great flabor)
Even though I ate mine right away, I didn't get the contrast of hot pastry, cold filling
Maybe it's because I went late in the day
Forget Krispy Kremes, These little babies are awesome
Flaky crust
light creme not too sweet
Just plain old goody goodness!
The real crispy cream! Those were the best cream puffs I ever had
Flaky crispy puffs and delicious cream
This brand new Japanese bakery serves The best cream puffs that you will be able to find
($1
25 ea)
After waiting in line, you will get to the counter where there is one person filling up the cream puff shells with cream
after which the cream puff is weighed to ensure that the correct quantity is used
Heavy ones are discarded
Another person packs the cream puffs in a box, and the third in line works the cash register
all working in perfect sync
After each customer pays, they all cheerfully thank you in Japanese in unison
Awesome!
In Short The cave-like interior of this smallish wine and tapas bar brings to mind ancient catacombs, while still looking a bit like a modern fabrication
Neighborhood regulars gather at the wooden tables, but the bar, backed by row upon row of wine bottles, is where the curious to experiment
Satiate the munchies with the cheese platter, a mix of soft, hard, and smoked Italian cheeses
Full dinners of lasagna, cannelloni, crepes and polenta are also served
I just went back to in Vino for the fourth or fifth time last week and loved it just as much as ever
The service is polite, helpful and attentive, the wine list is long and varied with good choices for any price range and the food is fantastic
I'd definitely reccommend the meatballs and lasagna
the sauce is heaven
In Vino just expanded their menu and now have entrees
I recommend the porcini mushroom ravioli in the cream sauce
it was very flavorful and the sauce had a lot of garlic
Yummy! The bread is wonderful too
Try it!
Having just toured Italy a matter of months earlier, this cozy, cavernous nook in the East Village gave me a serious flashback, as if I was back in Roma
With cheerful, on par service, a friendly vibe and a great menu, In Vino is a perfect date spot
Will be back!
we waited as well, but the decor takes you away, and the stuffed olives are amazing!! Definitely something to try
En Vino glows like you're swimming in a glass of Burgundy
I've been to the restaurant several times, and until last week, always an 8/10 experience
Sat
@ 10pm it was packed
We were told 1hr wait
1:20 later after some cheese and wine @ bar, I turned around and noticed there were 5 open tables asked the hostess if her brain was on, she apologized and sat us
Our server we saw only once and he seemed pre-occupied with a b-day party
We waited for him to bring a check after the meal, but he couldn't pull himself away from a conversation at the bar(Bad)  (Good)The wine is exclusively from Southern Italy, a rare treat (you won't find names like cabernet
Bottles are named by the maker--Syrah being an exception)
Perhaps our service was a fluke
I'll keep going back
Hopefully Keith, our usual server, will be back
Interesting wine list consisting of wines from southern Italy
These are very good and affordable wines
Good food too, and not expensive
As mentioned by another reviewer, a great place for a date
My wife and I go here a few times a month
It's relaxing, with nice music and delicious wine and food
We highly recommend it
at in vino
About a year ago, the wine list was enormous -- the most comprehensive tasting of Italian reds I've ever seen -- and the bartenders were friendly and highly knowledgeable
A recent visit proved to be SO disappointing! The wine list has changed dramatically, despite the bartenders' rude protests to the contrary
There are only a few by-the-glass offerings for each region, all in the $9 - $12 range (there used to be many $7 - $8 options)
The atmosphere is still to die for, but the wine list has so clearly been pared down and marked up (as a result of higher foot traffic brought in by lots of rave reviews in local publications, perhaps?)
My companion and I left without ordering anything, and we're not going back
A fun place
I've been here three times, and each time we had good wine and good food
I'm not familiar with many of the wines, but they are all good
A great date place too
This place had good small food plates, but the real star is the amazing wine list with many affordable wines from southern Italy
These are some of the best wines in the world, yet few people have tried them
The ambiance is very nice as well
We had a great time
Wine selection very good -interestingly focused on Southern Italy
Very good vibe inside - feels like you're in some quaint little Italian bar
The place got really crowded around 8ish when I went right before Christmas so reservations might be necessary
Food was pretty good but selection is not huge
more oriented toward picking a few plates and sharing (cheeses, meats, etc
) Good date place
The single available entree arrived lukewarm and over an hour after we sat down
Our waiter came through with an excellent wine recommendation though, so maybe In Vino, Out Famished?
The Scene It's both industrial and rough-hewn, with exposed brick, thick wood beams and an open brick oven
Tables are topped with craft paper over linen; likewise, suits are not uncommon, but neither are jeans
A smallish bar sits near the rear of the dining room, allowing for casual dining and wine sipping
Service is engaging and first-rate
The Food There's nothing daring about Chef Marc Murphy's modern American fare, but his cooking is so spot-on that even the most familiar dishes are remarkably satisfying
Start with warm profiteroles filled with melting goat cheese, a bowl of grassy spring asparagus soup or a large pot of steaming mussels in dijonnaise sauce with excellent fries for dipping
Entrees, from the incredibly tender braised lamb shank to the monkfish with olives, fennel and tomato, are excellent
Steaks, however, are overly fatty
For dessert, the affordable sampler is the way to go
I live a few blocks away from Landmarc, so my roommate and I order it all the time
Although I much prefer to dine in for the atmosphere, I can say that their takeout is just as good as dining in
which is tough to say for most restaurants
Everything always arrives very quickly; hot dishes are hot; cold dishes are cold
it's always really great
Don't miss: the wine list is AMAZING
The markups are very slight, so this is likely the very best value on wine you'll find in the city
Great selection, too
and lots of half bottles, which I can always appreciate
As far as food goes, the creamed spinach is the best you'll ever try, the mussels are outstanding, the rock shrimp risotto is a favorite, and the burger is just plain tasty
When dining in, I love the cheese plate, too
Another great value
(and don't miss the olive oil when dining in - not sure what they put in it, but it is de-licious!)
Bright and friendly welcome for a relaxed saturday lunchtime

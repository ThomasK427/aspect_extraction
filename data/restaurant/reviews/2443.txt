The food was the best part
Weenjoyed the Fruits de Mer platter, Prime Rib, Fines Herbes Crusted Salmon and Pear Cranberry Turnovers
It was certainly a night to remember!
My wife and I have dined at many of the nicest restaurants in NYC and this is one our favorites that we've wholeheartedly felt afterwards that we enjoy everytiime we visit
The food was delicious
The decor upscale but not pretentious
The service excellent
We always leave Tavern happy!
I love this place! Brunch is the best, however I started bringing clients here for dinner recently
The ambience is great for client entertaining, especially when the cleints are from out of town
Tavern is a great example of how a truly superior dining experience should be executed
I am suggesting Tavern as a location for my business hoilday party too
My family had an absolutely wonderful evening at Tavern on the Green
My brother and I have had the filet mignon ever time we have dined  there, and have never had a better filet anywhere
We celebrated our  son's first birthday there last July, and hope to spend his second birthday at Tavern also
Tavern is one of the most enchanting places I have ever visited
The ambiance, the service, the menus! I am a frequent customer of Tavern
My favorite Tavern event is Brunch
The french toast is the best this city has to offer! The wait staff was attentive and gracious
The dining rooms are so beautiful
Last weekend I went with my spouse, and we had the most delightful time! I highly suggest everyone disregards the notion that Tavern is a trap! On the contrary it is one of the best restaurants this city has to offer
Upscale dining at its best!
I was so disappointed with Tavern on the Green
I went for Valentines Day and I can say from start to finish my time there was a nightmare
I would never go back
even if the dinner was free
Really your money is better spent elsewhere
A huge disappointment!
Should have believed all the reviews
Had a 9:00 reservation
Arrived at 8:15
Bar was closed for a private party
Told to go to the gift shop!!! Finally got into the bar at 8:40
Ordered two martini's - Cost $30
00
Waitress asked what time our reservation was - at 9:10, she went to check on table status
Came back with a vibrating pager
At 9:40, still no table
At 9:45, demanded to be seated
Wine prices 3X inflated
Steak and prime rib was fine, lobster bisque soup had funny smell and no lobster
Overcooked mashed potatoes and overcooked green beans
Salad barely passed for Caesar
Bill for two without desert and one bottle of wine - $199
Pass this place up, New York is filled with outstanding restaurants and for this price, you can do much, much better
You definitely feel like you are in the worst kind of tavern
Once you have eaten there, you realize that the only way this restaurant survives is because of its location
Nothing else makes the experience enjoyable
The food is very average but very overpriced, and the wait staff should do a little training at McDonald's to understandwhat customer service is all about
Please, even if you are a tourist, do not waste you time or money at this TAVERN
Wish I had read these reviews before actually going there
The service was godawful, they didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink, if you can believe that
By the time we noticed, we were already thoroughly unimpressed to care
The food was mediocre
It's really not worth it
Please don't go
After hearing all the words of caution, and reading reviews, we decided on dining here for our anniversary dinner
I wouldn't mind spending over $200 for dinner if it were very good, which it wasn't
I'm suprised that such an establishment doesn't have the cuisine to support itself
There was a nice band outside, but we had to spend an extra $10 each to be seated out there to listen to them
The meal was just ok, I've had much better meals under $20
It's a classic New York experience I had been told, but if I were a New Yorker, I'd be embarassed if people believed that
You get the feeling that they're relying mostly on their history and location, and have forgotten about price and food quality
The food was great
The bread was excellant
The lobster bisque was good, but there was no lobster in it
The french toast was delicious! The best french toast I have had in my life
Finally, the cobb salad was ok- but ask them to make it w/o the blue cheese- it tastes too strong
The decor was beautiful
There is a long hallway with walls completley covered in mirrored tiles
The best room was the bar
It had a homey feel to it
My only complaint is that the service was average
My mother had to ask for a coffee refill three times before she got it
We had to ask for the bill twice, and our water was refilled only when we asked for it
Not what I would expect for such an expensive restaurant
I went there, last Valentine's Day and even though I made reservations 3 weeks in advance, I ended up waiting for 45 minutes after getting there
The staff was not helpful at all, and it took another 20 minutes to get served
Once that happened I was to be more disappointed when the food came
It was awful, overpriced and mass produced
I will definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I will never go there myself again
DO NOT GO HERE EVER!!!! This was the most appalling restaurant experience I have had in years
I can't remember if I have ever walked out of a restaurant before but did so here
Nice summer evening in Manhattan so thought it would be nice to eat in the Park
Booked for 9 and arrived at 8:40 and asked for table in garden
Was very rudely told to wait at bar
At 9 no table in garden
Sat inside, and ordered
Starter of penne arrived cold with tom sauce dried out
Complained to waiter who was surly and asked if I wanted another item
When I asked for some grace and an apology none was forthcoming so saw the manager who was equally rude
'You are walking out over cold pasta?' was the query I heard behind me as I got up and left
I took my mom to Tavern on the Green when she visited recently
Eh
It was okay
Definitely worth the experience, but don't plan on tasty food
The decor is garish retro, super fun, and looking out into the Park is lovely
Service is abysmal, and the food is barely adequate
But I still think it's worth the experience
Oh, and the guys in the gift shop are darling and sweet and should be running the whole service operation instead of whoever is doing so currently!

The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices
It is a great place for a date, family, get together or just for a realxing night out on the town
When Pier 2110 becomes fully open it will definitly be a gem in the midst of Harlem, well worth the trip

If you live close to lex 100, do NOT miss this spot!! My boyfriend and I went there without any expectation
such a good surprise! We had some calamaris chowder to start with, perfectly cooked! The burger is to die for and i had the best fish chips in years!! low prices and a very good service made our evening @ this new friendly location!!
I live above 96th and the restaurant selection is pretty sparse, a few expensive places scattered around and then fast food
So I was hoping Food would be a good in-between option for my limited going out budget
I was horribly mistaken
Although the price is right, the food is not
I got the ribs special ($17) (perhaps a mistake at a fish kinda place, but I usually assume specials are a safe bet), they were so salty as to be almost inedible
My girlfriend got the signature fish tacos ($11), bland, dry, greasy and boring all at once
The raw oysters were good (I guess you cant screw up shucking too badly), and the $1
75 PBR kept the price down
Oh, and service was pleasant, though to add insult to injury, the food took way too long to com e out
Until somebody in the kitchen gets their act together, avoid this place (unless you only want a cheap beer and a few oysters)
We had the misfortune of ordering from food last night
We are 3 blocks away from the restaurant and the delivery took 45 minutes!!!  When we called to ask what's going on, the manager scolded us for expecting quick service on a friday night
And when we mentioned we get quick service from restaurants further away he suggested we order from there from now on
Despite the exceptional rudeness, we were looking forward to the fish tacos but all we got was a greasy, slimy fried fish wrapped in a tortilla with a bit of cabbage
Highly recommended to avoid this establishment
New York has too many good restaurants to settle for overpriced junk food and bad attitude
Food stinks!
This is a full-service restaurant/spin-off of sorts to Charles' Southern Kitchen in Harlem
And, it's not that great
As the Harlem location is a walk-in/take-out place, it is more acceptable to have what tastes like boxed or powered mac n' cheese
I expected more from this location though
And, the fried chicken is medicore too (a supposed specialty for soul food establishments)
Having grown up eating soul food, I'd like to think that I know good food and this restaurant just isn't doing it for me
Not to mention my son had an ok serving of chicken and french fries
How do you mess that up? The only good thing is that this mediocre food is not expensive
Did I mention that the wait staff are not pleasant?! There are a bunch of teens who don't really want to be there
Seated promptly, greeted by all sushi staff, wait staff and manager
Seaweed salad a bit dry, shumai delicious, tuna tataki excellent, edemame a bit overcooked
All sushi, as expected, fantastic
What a treat to have a Yama in midtown
Room done exquisitely
Sleek and gorgeous from front to back
I am a regular patron of the Yama franchise in NYC
The prices are reasonable and the portions are sizeable
However, the foremost draw is reliability of satisfaction
I generally find their sushi fresh and velvety
The 49th street location provides the authentic toothsome Yama quality, but also presents a sleek new space with much attention to layout and design, delivering a more elegant dining experience
Yama49 has opened just 6 weeks ago
I took my friend to this new opened restaurant for lunch
Since there are so many Japanese restaurants in midtown, I did not have high expectations
But, I found the food was very good, the potion was huge, ambiance was very nice and service was impecable! Also, very reasonable for this quality and portion
I will definitly come back here quite often
This is real thin crust pizza and by far the best place to go for pizza in the neighborhood
I've been there several times already since it opened
Yum
I recently had a dinner party at Choice in their private room
We had a sit down dinner and cannot tell you how satisfied I was with the quality of service and food
It is very unique to the area as the decor is beautiful
Finally a place where I can go out with my friends that has a large selection of drinks and martinis (the wine list is impressive too)
A special thanks to Rich and Katie for making my event a memorable one
One more thing, try the Remedy Martini it won't let you down
I live in the Murray hill area and frequent Choice for dinner and drinks with friends
I met with Katie and discussed the possibilty of having my boyfriend's 30th birthday party in their back party room
I am writing this for one reason: to let the the staff and managers at Choice know that we had a great time and my guests were thrilled
Everything was first class from start to finish
The private room is beautiful (flatscreens, nice artwork, fireplace, private bar), the food is amazing, and we were treated very nicely
Great music only added to the atmosphere
The party was a smashing success and you have earned our business for future parties and events
Great job and many thanks- Mandy Jared
I highly recommend Choice--whether you're in the mood for drinks or hungry for a meal, Choice will not disappoint
The atmosphere is modern but comfortable, making Choice an ideal location to catch up with friends
The drinks were original without being goofy, and the menu is eclectic without spreading itself too thin
If you're having trouble choosing, choose Choice!
My co-workers and I keep coming to Choice because they have the best happy hours
Every Wednesday they do $6 martinis drinks all night long and they are all delicious
I also checked out the wine and jazz night on Tuesday night
The band was cool and they had $5 glasses of wine all night- I had the chardonnay and it was yummy
Highly recommended!
I am a huge fan of their location on the UES, Uptown Lounge
They operate a fantastic venue
My girlfriend and I went to Choice for dinner this past weekend and we were blown away
This is slightly more upscale then Uptown
The appetizers and entrees were delicious, but were presented in a way you would expect from a really high-end place
The prices were reasonable and they had a great selection of wines and specialty cocktails
The area is very busy, but Choice has a very unique feel
You have both a classy restaurant and a very high-energy bar (not your usual Murray Hill meat market)
Everything here is tastefully done
The decor is beautiful and only compliments the dishes that are prepared
The staff is also remarkable, very knowledgably and spunky (nice to deal with people who are not mad at the world)
I write this review b/c Choice and Uptown are a nice change from the hum-drum blah blah places in NYC
If you want to have a great meal, enjoy a nice bar scene, and actually have the manager, owner, and staff thanks -you, this is your place
Cheers to continued success and giving me and my company a Murray Hill home
Choice is a new addition to the Murray Hill neighborhood
I was looking for a place to hold by wife's 30th birthday party
I was hesitant to have the event at Choice solely b/c it was brand new and I haven't heard anything about it
The place is absolutely beautiful and the private party room is amazing
Every interior detail is superb
I spoke with Katie and Rich (managers) and we planned the party
We had the party last Saturday for 40 friends
The quality of service, food, and attention EXCEEDS the high standards of the interior space
The pricing is reasonable and the private room with bar was perfect
Everything was spectacular and my friends raved about Choice
This will be an instant hit
I have been to their other location on UES and can see they know what they are doing

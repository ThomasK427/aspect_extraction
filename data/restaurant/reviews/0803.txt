the food was plentifuland inexpensive
For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks
In Short  Deep in the bowels of Wall Street lies this shiny spot decorated with gleaming mint-green walls and framed French stock certificates that hint at the neighboring New York Stock Exchange
Bountiful treats like eclairs, tarts, cakes and an array of macaroons are all baked on the premises
More savory offerings are also available: warm quiche, croque monsieur and a Provencal salad of tuna, olives, fennel and potatoes
This shop makes me feel like I'm in Paris! The atmosphere is so quaint
This seems to be a big hit and draws a large crowd, so be prepared for a wait
Had the Soup of the Day - French Onion
That was really good
Fresh onions and not a lot of cheese
Just the way I like it
Also ordered a sandwich, which was surprisingly very good! Portions are small
The pastries look soo delicious, I'll definitely have to go back to try!
Have been a loyal fan at Financier since it opened in 2003 when it was a third the current size
It makes a consistent cup of coffee, lovely breakfast pastries, and decadent cakes
I've tried many of their cakes and recently bought a tray of the Petit Fours ($20 for 15 pieces), each bite was a delight filled with surprises
Their lunch is a good value (for the Wall St area
) The sandwiches are good, the salads are above the average standards, and the soup, though pricey, are great as well
I tasted that they use real stocks (probably prepared by Bayard's chef) to make those soups
They atmosphere is nice too, especially with the outdoor dining on Stone Street
Pricey, sinfully rich, delicious pastries delivered in great style
Lunch sandwiches and salads feature high-quality ingredients and painstaking preparation, but prices are high and portions small
Classic Croque Monsieur is the best in Manhattan, although the restaurant always runs out of these before noon
High-quality Illy coffee is amongst the best prepared in Manhattan
Everything here is too good to be real! I used to work in the neighborhood
So I become a loyal customer since the first day they open the business
Paolina is like stepping into a little resturant in Italy
The staff is 100% Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets
The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth! I highly recommend this restaurant!! Everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom!
Could there be a cuter, more authentic italian in the area? Food is excellent, service outstanding, and the price is excellent! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is interested in an excellent italian!
A coffee shop with great coffee and no attitude
Go figure
This is a great neighborhood coffee joint
As well as knowing all there is about his coffee, the owner knows the names of his regulars and thier orders as well! The staff is great and they know how to treat you, unlike so many other EV coffee shops whose employees that think they are too cool to be courteous
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING? Try the Cortado
i can't believe no one has written a review on this place
such a cute place
we get the french toast and the nutella/banana crepes every time
otherwise good food! definitely check it out
osaka is great
i usually go for sushi which is 50% off from 12pm-8pm everyday
making it an incredible offer (around 2
50 for the average roll)
i recommend their american dream and for those of you who like spicy food, get spicy mayo on the side-yum! they also have bubble tea and fried ice cream, making it great and affordable!
Great Taiwanese food without the travelling - no need to go to Flushing or Chinatown
it's great! The prices are the same as Flushing and Chinatown
also, if you don't like Taiwanese food
go for the Japanese

Our 11th year anniversary was ruined by very poor service this past Saturday July 17th
First of all, standing in front of the hosts face, she asked two other people if they needed help
Second, we waited about 1 hour to get our well done steaks, unbelivable! Our waitress was horrible! Did not ask us if everything was ok, did not offer to bring more salad or breast sticks (which are unlimited), and the place was bitterly cold
I will not come back here again, and do not recommend to anyone
I went to the one in Orlando Florida and was so happy that i decided to celebrate our anniversary here in ny
What a waste of our money and our time!
Im a mojito drinker,Cuba cafe rates number one in my book
I sat at the bar and watched the bartender make it from scratch
After two mojitos I ordered a few appetizers from the bar menu
I was in Cuba two years ago and Cuba cafe is the next best thind to it
Try the empanada sampler and the roasted pork loin
drinks were ok, food was average
The ambience was good
I had the cornish hen, it was ok
It had no taste
My wife had the paella
It was good
I lived in Miami, among thousands of Cubans for 5 years and never had a Cuban meal in a restaurant that was better than mediocre
No cheap ingredients, overly-salted meat, or plain-jane recipes here
I ordered the empanadas sampler, crab croqueta, and something else I don't remember but I remember (all appetizers) thinking this was the best Cuban meal I had ever eaten
A fine and complex mix of nuevo-latino ingredients make you aware that every bite closer to the end of the meal is the sad reality that you won't have food this good again soon, most likely
The wine on the table that the waiter tried to push was rather embarassing, so we ordered a reasonably priced bottle of Chilean Cabernet for $24 that turned out to be divine
The decor was a bit tacky, but the food more than makes up for it
this food lacks authenticity
i had the pollito and it was served to me RAW! i sent it back and it still came to back to me pink
The sangria was great and the cheese filled bread was fantastic
the menu didnt resemble anything that I am used to and neither did the taste
The ropa vieja wasn't quite right
I've have much better in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami
The food is not memorable
I miss Tropigrill/Pollo Tropical
The sangria was pretty strong
Everyone in the whole restaurant had a mojito, including my friend
Just go there
The mojitos are super and the mussels are the most unique and best I have ever had
Seafood is terrific and the chicken and others are up there, too
my boyfriend and I stopped in for drinks and appetizers
I loved their mojitos
They played great latin music and we had such a great time
The service was very friendly
We would definitely go back again
The decor is a bit gaudy, but the food is not
We have had the mussels in coconut sauce twice and we are totally addicted! And the warm, complimentary cheese bread (available for dinner only) is a worthwhile treat
We've tried a number of entrees, and have yet to stumble on anything below a 6
Although everything tastes too rich and creamy to be considered diet fare
It's not really authentic Cuban cuisine, but it's still a good meal (almost like comfort food) at a decent price
Went there on Good Friday evening, with my girlfriend (professional/latin) and received my complimentary bread WHEN the food was already served, after ordering each ONE beverage our check was huslted to our table before we could order another round and we didnt even ask for the check

Two people can easily eat here for $40
I will visit this place every now and then
It is not one of my favorites, but I left satisfied both times I visited
One of my favorite Turkish restaurants ever! Atmosphere very nice, friendly service
Food out of this world
Ali Baba is a great restaurant in an area with few great restaurants
It is very reasonable and the food is unreal
Every person I have taken there has loved it
Highly recommend the mixed appetizer plate and the chicken kebabs
The atmosphere is fine
ordering in from there is a great move
One more thing, this place is great for deliviries
Expect to be waiting for like 40 minutes on the weekends or on rainy days
I order food from this place at my work, and i have not had any problems
This place is great
I remember when they first opened up and were serving Pizza, Kebabs and Pides
Since than they have grown into a full restaurant
The reason why I love this place is that the owners very kind and considered
It is a family run business, with family values and warmness
But shortly, the food is amazing, whether it is the juicy kebabs, the sautes, the yogurtlu kebabs or the lahmacuns, pides, the appetezers, the soups,my god, my mouth is watering
These people are so good and so busy that there is usually a line outside, and a delivery time of 1 hour during the rush hours
The food, the service this place gives, truely can not be found easy
I went there the other night and saw that they will be moving to a bigger and better location, 212 E
34 st, several doors down
Anyway, I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
Charming, non-descript restaurant with excellent service and most of all, unbelievable, tasty Turkish food! The bread they serve you is out of this world! I have had the lamb and chicken kebab there
The meats are succulent, fresh and juicy! The deserts (flan and baklava) were also outstanding
For once, the citysearch hype is actually true on this one
Very crowded on weekends as the restaurant is very small but I believe they are in the midst of moving to a larger space next door
All the positive comments this place has received are well deserved
The kebabs were excellent, and the bread tasted like it had just come out of the oven
Service was prompt and courteous
I'll be back!
The food here is delicious
The babbaganoush is perfection
The service in general is very good
The atmosphere is sadly lacking
The wait time for food can be long, so don't dine here if you're in a hurry
The wait for a table can be long during peak times
Ali Baba is by far the biggest bang for your money for Turkish food and the quality of food is unbeatable
Once you go beyond the unpretentious atmosphere, you will find friendly waiters and delicious Turkish specialties such as lahmacun, babaganush, doner and other kebabs
While the food is good (not great), the delivery is extremely slow
Expect to wait at least an hour to receive your food at home
In a city like New York, where we all live on delivery food (for the most part), having to call 3 times to ask when your food is going to arrive is most frustrating (especially when the woman on the ohter end of the line is rude)- so by the time your do finally get your delivery, you are so agrivated that you're no longer hungry
So my advice is, do not put in for a delivery order, but instead go there in person - it will save you some very precious time!
I found this place when it was still a pizza counter with a Turkish restaurant in the back
Thankfully, they've put an end to the 'za, and are focusing instead on amazing lamacun (Turkish pizza), kebabs and salads
Everything is of the best quality, high on flavor and SO reasonably priced
I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Mediterranean food, and challenge anyone to find a better place for Turkish in the city
It may not be fancy, but the food alone is worth a trip!
A great family run place serving fresh, tasty and, I'm told, authentic fare
Great value, great taste and great service
A real find for casual dining
In fact, I am so addicted to the mixed appetizers with the fresh bread, that I have it almost twice a week
While the ambience is not the greatest, the excellent food and low prices make up for everything else - DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!
Went here last night and was blown away by the quality of the food
We ordered babbaganoush to start, which came with warm Turkish bread and was out of this world
I had the mushroom saut for my entree, and it was fantastic, really tasty
everyone else ordered meat dishes and was equally impressed
The service was friendly, the atmosphere was low-key but pleasant, and the music was funky Turkish pop (actually good!)
Oh, it was cheap, too, came to about $15/$18 incl
service
Best restaurant in the world!!!! I started off going to Turkish Kitchen down the road - Ali's didn't look too appealing
Finally got dragged in
That day will go down in history! Succulent meat, gigantic portions
and that bread!!! Try the yogurtlu, or the mix shish
If you are there early enough for dinner you may get to relish the doner itself!!!!! I have moved down town and get withdrawal symptoms
Need my Ali Baba fix!
My girlfriend lives nearby and this is far and away our favorite place to eat
This past summer, we went to Turkey and up and down the whole eastern coast, we couldn't find a meal as good as the ones we get here
My only gripe is they bring the bread out before the rest of the meal
It is so freakin' good and hot I stuff myself on that by the time the food comes
Adana kebabs, pide, manti are all spectacular
And its all so cheap
They should become a chain and open in other parts of the city
this is easily the best turkish restaurant in the city
the tight space and lackluster service (they always seem severely understaffed) are in need of much improvement
however, the authentically delicious food makes it very worthwhile
favorites: all eggplant appetizers, calamari (super tender), pitzas, and fried cheese rolls
if you want real turkish food, you must come here
We all order from Mondello
The baked ziti is to die for, and the chicken parm brings tears to my eyes
Granted, we all want to take a nap after we gorge ourselves, but it is so completely worth it
AMAZING chicken parm! Pizza is pretty good, but who cares when there is that chicken cutlet fresh out of the oven on that fresh baked bread with homemade sauce slopped on top, coated in cheese?! The chef salad is good (and big!) too, if you really must have something moderately healthful (comes with a hunk of their fabulous bread)
Counter service is always friendly and speedy
There is usually a line out the door at lunchtime, but it moves quickly so hop on!
Forget Sbarro
Forget Rays
A true Pizzeria can only be run by an Italian guy, his brother and a motley crew of Mexicans (I think theyre Mexicans, I could be wrong) donning the Mondello Pizza Pasta t-shirts in an array of colors
The service is quick
The pizza is great
But the heroes
Theyre to die for! Meatballs, sausage peppers, chicken, eggplant and shrimp: everything a growing boy (or girl) needs
Add spaghetti, ziti or lasagna for the perfect lunch platter
Theres no better place for true quick Italian cuisine
If you live or work in lower edge of midtown/garment district, this spot is worth checking out
During any night of the week, there is always something going on in this great lounge
The food is somewhat limited in variety, as their drink specials play the more dominant role on their menu
Food wise, a favorite in the house is definitely the Bulgoki Doria and their Anju appetizer selection is fantastic
The fruit soju cocktails are great as are their bottle choices, which are extremely inexpensive

This tiny restaurant is sure to be your next fave
The duck confit, which I have already had 4 times in the past 2 weeks, is the most spectacular I have ever tasted
Please try to order a dish that is served with the corn cake
It is amazing
The lobster bisque is warm and rich and the chocalate mouse is delicious
I have never been to a restaurant where the staff was more charming or gracious
The staff here makes you feel like family
26 seats is the most wonderful restaurant , I have been to so far
It is such a little cute place with marble tables, antique furniture, beautiful velvet curtains, and a homy feeling that make you want to spend the entire evening there
The music is great, but most important are the quality of the food, the low prices on the menu ( I still have money in my pocket after paying the bill)and the warm hospitality of the owners
Thank- you 26 Seats for a beautiful evening
After reading the Citysearch reviews, my friend and I were excited to try this place
Arrived on a weeknight and there were only 2 tables filled: after eating our meals, we knew why
This was hands down, one of the worst meals I've had in NYC - the service was very friendly, but service aside, I'm sorry to say the food was just really poor
My friend's salmon was flavorless and undercooked
My bass was even worse - smothered in some kind of tomato sauce that just did not go with fish and the spinach that accompanied the dish was extremely dry and flavorless
The bread on the table reminded me of Wonderbread
Decor in the restaurant reminded me of a 70s basement w/ dark wood paneling and scant else
Uovo across the street is a much better bet
I have been frequenting 26 seats for years
Everyone who i have brought here loves it! Everyone who works there is so nice
The best part about this place is the sheer value you get
It is hard to find good, inexpensive French food in the city, but 26 seats has it all! It feels like you are stepping into a bistro on the streets of any place in france! I have probablly tried everything on the menu and it is all amazing! The food rivals many well known more expensive restaurants I have tried
It is the best food you can get for the least money anywhere in the city if you ask me
I'm almost afraid to give it such a good review b/c I'm afraid of being unable to get reservations in the future, but this place is truly the best find in the city
Everything I've ever eaten there was good (Duck Confit, Roasted Quail, Mussels, Striped Bass, Broiled Salmon), Yes, everything is good
The great music and beautiful girls with great french accents draw the rest of the scene together
A must try if you like authentic French Fare
26 seats is one of my favourite restaurants in NYC
Although the restaurant is very small (only 26 seats) the atmosphere is dark and intimate and the food is always amazing
26 seats also has the most reasonable prices in NYC, it is a true gem
Everything is yummy
I highly recommend Escargots and Duck Breast
Service was great and the best thing is the price!!!
really great gem in the east village, cannot recommend it enouugh
After receiving a glowing recommendation from a friend, my roommate and I decided to try 26 Seats on a weeknight
The place was absolutely AMAZING
I had some of the largest, most flavorful mussels I've ever had - absolutely steamed to perfection
They serve food with an entire loaf of freshly-baked bread, crusty on the outside and unbelievably warm and gooey in the center
The atmosphere is romantic, the food is exceptional, the prices can't be beat -- you are doing yourself an injustice if you don't give this place a try
The food is quite good, but what really makes this restaurant is the value
Most entrees, including wild striped bass, trout, and balsamic chicken, were under $15
I had the perfectly-cooked duck breast in cherry juice reduction with sweet potatoes for $13
75
The East Village has always been a place for value, but this really takes the cake
Service is friendly though harried, since there is only one waitperson for all 26 seats
And the room is VERY noisy, but I suppose that's because everyone is having a good time
Not a place to go for a quiet meal, though
Charming, friendly, tiny
A find
The special asparagus with melted cheese and quail in a sweet brown sauce were outstanding
Feels like your crazy aunt's parlor, the one with the candles and mirrors
Reservations a must
Food is absolutely authentic French bistro- really fresh and delicious
Funky, yet romantic atmosphere, and friendly service
I highly recommend this gem
It maintains the funkiness of the East Village circa 1990, yet has a casual elegance as well
The Scene Saul Bolton's popular restaurant opened on Smith Street in 1999, just as Carroll Gardens was gaining a reputation as a fashionable dining destination
The spare, 48-seat space has hardwood floors, pale yellow and exposed brick walls, a pressed tin ceiling and a fair amount of room in between tables
The Food The brief New American menu changes often with the seasons
Selections include dishes like tuna carpaccio with fennel-apple-avocado salad; roasted chicken with yellow corn, baby carrots and Swiss chard; and pepper-and-coriander crusted sirloin with roasted shallots, sauteed spinach and potato puree
Desserts include updated takes on old-fashioned numbers, such as baked Alaska made with a chocolate wafer crust and served with Myers' dark rum sauce
I was very surprised by the very un-Brooklyn prices and portions
The food was delicious, but the portions were shockingly small and expensive
For example, my husband and I split a winter salad as an appetizer
A $15 salad sounds more like a Manhattan price, but who cares if it's good, right? Well, when our server brought the salad out, we thought they had only brought 1/2 of the salad
It was incredibly tiny
The server could have told us that this measly portion was not really suitable for sharing
On to entrees
My scallops were delicious, but for $26 I got three
That seems really greedy for Brooklyn
My husband didn't even like his cod at all
Thought the sauce it was in was terribly unappetizing
I did think the food was good, but I would never got back
Looks like the Michelin star rating got to their heads!
The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of
I plan on eating here more often
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street
As far as scary Smith Street, I am all for people being scared and/or turned off by the neighborhood
One less manhattanite the better
Oh, and the other poster who compared Saul to the Peruvian place across the street
c'mon - you're kidding, right?
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food! I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated
Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert
The regular entrees and desserts here are excellent, with truly unusual sides and garnishes that make for brilliant flavor combinations with the central meat or fish
However, do not order the prix fixe menu, as you won't get all those fantastic extras, so you end up with a tiny portion of boring food
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
Can't wait wait for my next visit
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
The wine list is interesting and has many good values
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan
Someone should tell these people that high prices on the menu does not make your restaurant better

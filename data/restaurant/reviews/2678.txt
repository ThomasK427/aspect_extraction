Their fresh Gnocchi was to die for with the fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella melted on top
I ordered it last night, and it was drenched in this white parmesan sauce and took away from the taste of the gnocchi
The funny thing, they used the same sauce to drench the lasagna for someone else in my group
Just did feel right and defiantly not Italian
The only saving grace was the great Calamari, but the main course was sub par
So sad
so sad
Full of characters from the neighborhood, it's a fun place to meet up with friends or have a drink at the bar
The service is always friendly and the food is consistent and good
From burgers, bar food to some decent Italian dishes, its worth a visit
Its a place you are always welcomed back
Occasionally there is also live music and some awesome parties and karaoke on Friday nights
So, eat, drink and be merry at Juniors
In Short To call this the River Cafe of Queens is not much of a stretch
Both are on barges, both have a pianist
And Water's Edge has an equally dazzling view--the glass spires of midtown Manhattan
It also offers a free ferry ride to and from the restaurant
The nautically themed dining rooms are plush and spacious, and virtually every table has a water view
Chef Ari Nieminen steers the menu with selections from the sea and farm, plus seasonal specialties
If you like your kitch in large doses with a hint of turn-of-century bordello and cheesy Indian trying to be classy but failing atmosphere, this is the place for you! True, a nice view of Manhattan, but it is a restaurant after all so the whole selling pitch can't depend just on view - which from the inside by the way is not spectacular due to the poor design of the restaurant
In summary, below-average food and above-average prices
If you're cheesy and don't know much about food and want to impress a date who hasn't been around much and is very easily impressed, it's the place for you - particularly if you like over-paying
If you are a discerning diner, take the water taxi there and back from Manhattan to enjoy the view, then go to a real restaurant
I went to Water's Edge a few weeks ago for dinner
Although it isn't a Trendy atmosphere by any means the view is wonderful
I would suggest however to request a window view that is not blocked by their ferry
I was sitting in front of it and it was great when the ferry left but when it returned it blocked our view! I ordered a sea bass and it was DELICIOUS
The food was rushed a bit but its a nice place to go if you want a nice view and a very good meal!
My husband surprised me this past Saturday for our anniversary
He just told me when to be ready and that was it
I was surprised by the ferry ride to the restaurant and the service from the very beginning was impecible
My husband had the sea bass and it was totally awesome
My scallops were fantastic as well
The maitre'de came by to ask how our meal was and when my husband told her it was our anniversary, she came back with two glasses of champagne
Our waiter was very nice and even sang Happy Anniversary to us and we got a second glass of champagne on the house
It was an awesome evening and we will return very soon!!!
We were not offered a prix fix menu and were expected to order drinks
When we asked for water, regular tap water, they made a face at us
They kept coming asking if we want to order drinks and did not except no
The menu was given to us verbaly, after we ordered and got the salad we were told that one of the choices was not avilable
We had to order from the regular menu and were charged the regular price, plus an additional charge for the salad which would have been included otherwise
When we tiped according to the service (12%) the waiter came back and asked out loud to verify the amount of the tip
We are not tourisits but we felt like we have just been treated like tourists who don't understand restaurants
We will not go back or recommand it to others
From the Boat Ride from Manh, Cocktail, Dinner, View, Piano Music the return trip on the ferry the service was excelent
Everyone was very attentive to the point were the head waiter call us by name How is everything Mr Mrs
Try to Have a time to enjoy the Piano Music before or after Dinner
Dinner was all delicious
It is hard to find all of this in one Restaurant
I went there with my girlfriend
View was awesome and food was really good too
Bill was $180 inculiding tip
It's great place to go with girlfriend
I thought the place was very romantic especially the boat ride back and forth across the East River
What a relaxing way to spend a few hours with someone special
back
But all in allwhat a great experience
The servers kinda pushed utensils, coffee etc
without saying excuse me, just passing over you like your not there, my date almost got her chin clipped by the coffed cup
The my scallops with risotto were to die for, my date's duck was overcooked/dry
It was raining when we got there so we couldnt sit Alfresco, but saw the seats outside, I dont know if they're that comfortable to sit on through dinner
Requested a window seat but didn't get it, which was fine because we still had a nice view a table away from the window
Definitely the bus boys/service guys need some more finesse in dealing w/ the table
What a wonderful place! We had the tasting menu with wine
What a fabulous deal! We had the 4 course tasting menu which was really 7!! The tasting menu is $75 a person and we added wine to it for an extra $38 a person
This included 5 glasses! Even with our large appetites we could not finish all the food or wine, which has never happened with a tasting menu before
Such excellent service as well
We were not rushed out at all and really enjoyed the live piano player
Taking the ferry over also made it very romantic
my 4th visit here was just before xmas 2003
once again nothing to complain about other than i ate too much
It my be pricier than other restaurants, but look at where you are
This converted barge sits on the east river with the best view of Manhattan in queens
An entree is very reasonable here
The appetizers and $14 martini my not be your best value
If the weather is nice, take advantage of the outdoor deck
Lunch is a great value if you can't afford a minimum of $50 pp for dinner
Or better yet, if on a budget and want to do something romantic, stop at the bar for a drink and enjoy the sunset
My gf and I celebrated an anniversary here
Being here for the first time, the maitre'd seated us at a nice corner table
I was a bit disappointed since this restaurant is supposed to have a great selection of wine, yet the captain did not present us with a wine list
Regardless, here's what we had: salmon salad/duck salad, ribs/fish, and two orders of the apple cinnamon ice cream
They knew it was our anniversary and everyone wished us a good one! That hit the spot
One oversight: the gf wanted tea to go along with the plate of yummies they gave me, but the server forgot to bring it since we took our time to finish the wine
The captain apologized for this and all was well
Well visit again soon
:)
I must admit, the view there is spectacular and thats it
My wife and I are avid restaurantuers, we have been around the city from daniel to the brassiere
We looked foward to going to the waters edge for a quiet dinner
We dont mind paying $200 for dinner and wine (stags leap), we did mind the mediocre service and OK food
The crab must have been frozen, van de kamps or something out of the wal mart freezer section, and the the waitstaff appear as though they were recently employed, OH? does thet fork go on the right or left, let me ask the captain After, the eating a catered typed meal at 5 star prices we witnessed clients being hauled out like cattle on a farm, after the check of course your boat is ready sir
I would rather eat at olive garden and look at a postcard
This place is great, i would recommend it to anybody trying to make a good impression everything was right in this restaurant
We went to dinner at Water's Edge last Valentine's day it was not what my boyfriend expected
He made reservations thinking it was a real romantic place
Don't get me wrong the place is beautiful the view is great but if you expect great service don't go there
We felt cattle being herded in the restaurant
We were waited on like robots from the unhelpful staff then we waited forever for the check since the wine was not included in the $300 prix
Who knows maybe its just special occasions when you don't receive personal service

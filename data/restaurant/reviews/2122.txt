Went here over the weekend for a birthday
Good American menu and good wine list (bottles spanned all price ranges)
The service was extremely friendly and the food was above average
This is a good spot if you're looking for a nice dinner that isn't trendy
After reading some of the reviews, we were a bit apprehensive, but to our great surprise, we enjoyed a wonderful dinner, great service and still had some cash in our pockets for a nightcap on the way home
I had the lobster and filet and both were very tasty
I was shocked at the size of both servings in the entree with an abundant serving of veggies with the entree! Our bread was fresh and warm, and our servers were very attentive
They have a nice wine list where you can find bottles as low as $21
The view and atmosphere of the restaurant were just perfect for a nice evening out with either your spouse or significant other or for taking family out for a special dinner
We left with a full belly and very satisfied with the overall dining experience
For a $35/person buffet brunch, I expected more than we got
Fairly limited selection of food, none of which was particularly outstanding
Waiters didn't clear the plates or fill the coffee enough
You pay for the view which is nice but not remarkable (you're staring at Queens and the UN)
It seems to have a lot of pretense - jackets required for dinner and they want you to tip the captain - but for me the restaurant didn't warrant that kind of upper crust touch
For views I'd recommend the River Cafe in Brooklyn, which has Manhattan outside the window, not Queens
And better food ambience, in my opinion
a meal here for a special occasion or just because
I eat here at least 3 times a month and usually once for brunch
The food is always VERY good
I have never once had a bad meal and consistency is important and the sign of a superior restaurant
Some advice: have the prime rib if it is a special, try a price fix lunch or dinner because it is an exceptional value
The lamb is amazing, the mashed potatoes with scallions are EXCELLENT and the breads on the table (all of them) are excellent
Do not skip the sorbet because it is amazing
Their house resiling is the best I have ever had
The service is exceptional
I had high expectations of this restaurants but was disappointed with the visit
The food was not of relative value to the cost
The service was poor in that there were multiple captains and waiters along with the table not being set when we were seated
The temperature in the room was also very cold with drafts over the tables
View is okay
not that great
Food is bad
With the price that I paid for, i dont think it was worth it
There is just nothing special about their food
I would rather go to Mcdonald
seriously !!! And i dont think i will be recommending this restaurant to a friend

Turn back all ye who venture here! Before it's too late! Don't risk sinking your dinner or party plans with this uneven, unfriendly, and unprofessional establishment
This club is no place to be a member
This must be one of the most breath-taking views for dining in the city
Service is always outstanding
After my Cherrystone Clams and House Smoked Salmon, I enjoyed Stuffed Maine Lobster with lemon butter and mashed potatoes O'Keeffe
As always the meal was outstanding
After I retired to The Lounge to enjoy a good cigar
If you're seeking some of the most friendly and responsive service combined with one of the best menus in the city, with outstanding views then this is a stop you need to make
Also, The Water Club offers a very romantic setting during dinner

As a natuve New Yorker, I know a good bagel and Daniels has by far THE best I have ever had
Not only are the bagels absolutely delicious, but the lox spread, scallion cheese and whitefish salad are to die for
this bakery has been there for over 80 years, so they are doing something right! they offer a free cookie to all the children and thats un-heard of in this day and age! i love their desserts, and i especially love the made to order cakes
i place my order a day before and i have my freshly baked cake for whatever my occasion
they always have me trying something new because they have such a large selection to choose from
they go out of their way to please me
when you walk in there, dont be surprised if you feel like a kid in a candy store all over again!
They have the most delicious Strawberry short cake i ever tasted! Real strawberries and whipped cream! i was impressed
very reasonably priced for the serving size
i will definately be back for more!
The people in here are extremely rude and unprofessional
The food is stale and the people do not know how to treat their customers
You would think since the food is so bad they would make it up in their customer service
This place is very friendly and reasonably priced
I needed a large birthday cake and they were able to have it ready the next day
No delivery, but they 're open until 9pm
The cake was delicious and the price was much better than anywhere else that I called - and I called alot of places
I would definitely use them again
Yuck
Really, really bad
Not even recognizable as eggs benedict
And the french toast was bad (and late arriving to our table) too
I'd never go there again
Although it is somewhat out of place-located in little india, this french oriented patisserie was a very pleasant encounter after walking several blocks in a cold day
Even though the place is under staffed, the bit of waiting time was quenched by the charm of the place and the kindness of Frederick, the owner and chef
The dessert selection is great and my girlfriend and I recommend visiting it without hesitation
We ordered french toast with egg and spinach, expecting to get regular french toast with the egg and spinach on the side
What came out were some mushy slices of bread COVERED with a spinach goo/sauce and a fried egg
It tasted awful, and my coffee was weak
It took us over 30 minutes to get our food, and saw others waiting about the same time just to order
We saw some people leaving after they ordered, obviously fed up
To make things worse, the prices are not cheap and they already include 15% tip on the bill
The thing is, I saw three francophone parties dining there, so I'm wondering if I just don't get it
The whole place is run by one chef (who take the orders and runs downstairs to cook it), one waiter (who delivers the food), and one bus boy, so they are definitely understaffed!
I tried the World Famous French Toast (awarded in 1988)
You can have the French toast by itself, with bacon and eggs, or with spinach and eggs
Now most people would probably assume that the spinach and eggs would be placed on the side but to my dismay, my French toast was lathered in mushy chopped spinach and the sunny side up egg was sitting on top
I dont know if it is a French thing but I found the combination of chopped spinach mixed in with the cinnamon and sugar of the French toast to be a truly disgusting mixture
The French toast is basically a soggy piece of bread with a hint of cinnamon and sugar
I guess there is a reason why it hasnt won the World Famous award in the past 17 years
Appearances can be VERY deceiving
We walked into what we thought was a cute, quaint place for Sunday Brunch but left with nothing but horrible memories
We waited over 20 minutes to place our order with the chef himself, who was not only impatient but unhelpful
Finally we get our meal - a 4$ croissant that is half the regular size and has not yet risen, french toast slopped with cinnamon (and no syrup to be found), runny eggs (practically raw) doused in oil and herbs, and the most disgusting 'all-natural' fruit juice ever
Only the coffee was good
All those around us had the same look of disgust
I just can't believe how chef Frederic is still in business
I ate brunch here with friends this morning, and we're dumbfounded that this place does any business
The food here is UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE
According to the menu, their 'signature french toast' was top rated by a reputable publication
Ok, so that was back in '88, but how much worse could it have gotten in 16 years? Apparently, quite bad and unfortunately we all ordered the same thing
Each order arrived on a small white plate with two, fist-sized, unidentifiable, brown lumps

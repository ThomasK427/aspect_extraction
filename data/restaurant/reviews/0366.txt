Also while you're there, challenger the bartender to make you a martini
his are the best in the city
If I had more than two thumbs, trust me they would be up! Great steak at a great price!
Thanks to citysearch we tried this place and were not disappointed
The food was great, prices were about the same as they are in Columbus Ohio where we live
That certainly was a pleasant surprise
The staff was very friendly and informative
They even have a staff member who comes around and explains each cut of meat before you order
The sides are meant to share and are very good also
The jazz band who was playing on Saturday night was a good accompaniment to the meal and not overpowering
I went to Roth's and I don't eat red meat and I loved it! The fish was superb as well as the drinks
I don't know what these people are talking about, the service was superb, top notch! The atmosphere is romantic and the prices were good for a delicious steakhouse
Definitely try Roth's!
Wow, great place, food was terrific, went here for 1 year annniversary
Live jazz is great, a nice romantic place to spend it w/ someone special
Babyback ribs were unforgetable, i still think of them days later
Filet mingon is great, awesome value, i decided to go from the reviews on this site,,
I've been living on the Upper Westside for fifteen years now
I've seen many restaurants come and go in this location, and it is clear that this place is here to stay
Given the level of service, the quality of food, and the overall dining atmosphere, Roth's is the type of establishment that I am proud to call my neighborhood restaurant
Went this past Saturday and had a great time, after requesting NOT to sit at the table in the back right by the door (one should not judge guests by their choice of dress)
Our server Julio was good, the bartender ROCKED the apple margaritas
The tomato blue cheese salad was ok, didn't care for the bbq sauce on the bottom, not enough kick to it
The porterhouse was decent, asked for it medium well, came out more red than pink
The sauces were great, esp
, the bleu cheese
The sides were really good
The apple margaritas - THE ABSOLUTE BEST
Definitely will be back
I was at first rather hesitent about eating at Roth's as I had heard through others that the service was slow and inconsistent
To my great pleasue I found that this was not the case at all
It seems as though the owner/management has finely ironed out the early mistakes and has, quite frankly, engineered one of the finest steakhouses I have frequented in my years in NYC
I see no problem with the service and believe that the food rivals any of the most highly touted steakhouses in the city
I have been to this place several times and the food is really Great
The Service is also very good but the staff are a bit snobby
It's expensive but the food is worth it
One tip is to only order one side between two
After dining all over the city with friends and going from steakhouse to steakhouse, we (four of us) think we've found the one
Not all closed in, not old boys club feeling, yet still masculine
food that was for lack of a better word
amazing, and service that was stellar
The Delmonico steak floored myself and one friend, while another had the salmon and another their shrimp scampi
All four of us shared the decadent hot chocolate cake and apple crisp, and we left, filled, satiated, and not too heavy a hit on the wallet
Add to this, a live jazz band softly playing while you eat! All in all, the place is great for dinner/date/pre-theater/or as we saw while dining, couples with their kids
I say Bravo Mr
Roth, Bravo!
Friendly staff from the moment we walked in
Everyone had a smile, drinks were ordered right away, the menu was explained to us thoroughly
The waiter was very helpful and cooperative
We even had the manager ask if things were good
Great service and great food
Environment was excellent, I would definitely reccommend this to everyone
It's a bit of a trip uptown, but it's worth it once you get there
The lunch menu is affordable, yet limited
The waiter we had could've been a bit less rude to say the least
The restaurant provided the best combination of great food and great atmosphere
If you wat to be treated like you were at the Ritz without having to dress the part, this is the place for you!
Unfriendly Bartender! He was more interested in practicing his Cocktail impersonation of Tom Cruise, Only he kept dropping his mixing tins
Food was great, Chef knows his meat
Management / Ownership seemed very unaware of what was happening and it seems to me that they should be paying attention, wasn't that busy
Service slow and bungled, seemed more like we were bothering the staff
The display of beef was unclear and we could barely hear the guy over the terrible music
Manager or owner, who ever it was, needs a wardrobe consultation, looked more like a slumber party than a steak house!
We stumbled upon Roth's quite by accident during our last visit to NYC
We had such a great meal and great service, we came a second time on our long weekend
Everything was excellent the second time around as well
Fine food, excellent wine, and outstanding service
We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fine steak house
and the prices are excellent for the value provided
The food and wine were both great


interesting selection
I was definitely looking forward to the live jazz, but discovered that given the smallish nature of the restaurant, the band was a bit overbearing (maybe it's not always that way)
All in all, we were treated well and everyone was happy
I'm not much of a meat eater
but this place is soooo good
I had the T-Bone
it was absolutely the best steak I've had in my life
medium rare of course
The Shrimp Scampi was good too
but only 7 shrimps
The Fried Calamari is a MUST here!! Get the Calamari
you'll thank me
Live Jazz makes this dining so romantic and beautiful
the wait staff is very professional
you will feel pampered
I don't know if it was the amazing food, the unobtrusive jazz music, or the great service that ultimately did it
but somewhere during my dining experience at Roth's the place became the #1 place on my list
While the wine selection isn't as extensive as I'd like, the quality/quantity of their steaks more than makes up for it
The Scene At the fun and friendly Faan, cell phone-toting, pierced college students rub shoulders with Birkenstocked baby boomers
When weather permits, patrons sit on the bare-bones outdoor deck or the makeshift sidewalk seating area
The interior is almost as casual, with a handful of tables and a tiny cocktail bar
The Food With nearly 200 dishes from every Asian country except India, there's something for everyone on the menu
The stir-fries portions are big with spice levels manageable for most palates
Beef with spinach is tasty, and anything with bright-flavored lemongrass is worth trying
Spring rolls are simple wonton wrappers folded around diced, fresh veggies; there's also Pad Thai
Sushi has novelty value: Try the crab and cucumber Brooklyn Roll
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years
I've been to plenty of great sushi spots in manhattan; Faan is always my favorite for sushi and chinese

other than that, the salman, chicken is totally amateur
rather lousy i would say
definitely a cool place for either a date or with friends
the food was great
service was pretty good
i would recommend a table upstairs for dinner
very low-key, nice ambience, etc
the downstairs seating area seemed tight and loud
pretty crowded as expected on a weekend, so a reservation would help out some
several years ago my husband and I were looking for a place to have a drink after a long day of Christmas shopping
We rejected several places and when we looked inside Raoul's it had the charming atmospere we were looking for
Everyone was delightful and when we asked if we could get a table for dinner, not only were we seated graciously, we sat next to Liv Tyler and her now husband
Our waiter was great and I had sublime duck with a potato/sweet potato grain that i have duplicated and serve at the holidays
Our waiter, who was from Albany ( we live near) gave us a complimentary dessert
We have made dinner at Raoul's part of our holiday tradition and have always been thrilled with the experience
My boyfriend brought me here to celebrate our 2 yr anniversary and it was PERFECT! The food was perfection and complimented our savory wine wonderfully
Ask for the garden room
Much quieter then the bar area and it offers an air of romance that the rest of the resturant cannot match
I have to say, this is one of the best meals I've had! The host is very snooty and rude, but then, it was a Saturday night at 8:30 and we had no reservation
It took and hour to get a table and the place was so packed we had to finally go outside to wait, however, the food was absolutely wonderful! I had the steak frites and my friend had the duck, and both were to die for
It was definitely the best duck I have ever tasted
They serve delicious bread and butter before the meal as well
I thought the prices on the wine and food were quite reasonable, especially for the unique atmosphere and trendy neighborhood
The best advice is to make a reservation, but I wouldn't miss this spot for the world!
I read the reviews on how great this place was I was so excited until I got inside
1st of all, the place is small
The Host was @ the OTHER end of the bar
Had reservation for 8pm got there @ 7:45 didn't sit til 8:20pm
Crab cake: Negative, it was cold
For all my Escargot LOVERS, be aware that they take it out the shell 4 U place it in a plate w/bread crumbs grapes -HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED
Entree: Had the Sauteed Black Sea Bass
Key word:SAUTEED
Its served with clams around the plate (only 4)
I ate my dates food ate only 1 bite of my bass
Dessert: Creme Brulee-it was okay, it started off warm on the edges then it got really cold in the middle
Such a DISAPPOINTING DINING Experience
I would not recommend this place to ANYONE
Went there for Christmas Eve without a reservation
Managed to be seated in a nice patio room complete with Christmas tree after only two drinks
Everyone was friendly and attentive except the doorlady who snorted when I told her that I didn't have a reservation but ushered me in nonetheless
Could not resist the steak frites after seeing so many around me enjoying it
It did not disappoint - possibly the best I've ever had
And the deserts were decadent
I applauded the kitchen staff on my way out (to get to and from the patio you pass through the kitchen) needing no more for my Christmas
Normaly I go once a month or so, yes im an addict to there steak frites
Normaly dont order anything else, thats my husbands job ,we always end up sharing my steak but some charming waitres talked me into the specials that unbeliveable
the gravlox perfectly done and homemade foie gras sausage on lamb,creative and exciting, so different from the ala cart menu that is going from boring,to out dated to right out of cookbooks(scallops)
PS-there was a foie terrine last time i went arguably the best in the city
To bad its not consistent to the rest of the food that ive had there
Great french food w/o attitude
Relaxed atmosphere but a bit too dark
Very friendly staff
Fairly priced food
Not light food so be hungry
The salmon dish was terrible
The salmon was obviously not fresh - it had a strong fishy taste
The sauce was equally bad
The waiter saw that I didn't eat mine, but neglected to ask if anything was wrong
Having just returned from Paris and wonderful meals at reasonable prices, Raoul's was a huge rip-off
I will never go back
I returned to Raoul's recently after many years away
My steak was the best I remember ever having at Raoul's and the Tuna Carpaccio left me wanting to return again and again
Service was a treat from my French (Canandian)waiter who knows more about wine than anyone waiting on me in NYC in a long time
Congratulations Raoul's on keeping it going
I loved Raoul's fois gras terrine and am missing it after they have a new chef from last year
On my last visit, one of the waiter told me that they were thinking to put Fois Gras terrine back to their menu
I am looking forward to it
Well, besides Fois gras, I must admit that I liked the food from the last chef better than the ones from new chef,, but no complain about the new ones
Still, they are very tasty and actually became a bit more new york style of French food
Well, I am still on authentic side, though
My friends I ate at Raoul's last night and had the best meal I've had in a very long time
First of all, we were told it was probably going to be an hour wait since we didn't have a reservation, but they ended up seating us in great seats on the patio within 5 minutes! The waitstaff was very attentive and the food was incredible
The peppercorn steak w/ fries was amazing, along with the artichoke appetizer
I'll be back
Went here for dinner with husband just for Steak Au Poivre
We live in upper east side so it was quite a trek
Best dinner I've had in a long time! We asked to be seated in the Garden Room, which is quieter than the main dining room
Service was nice
I cannot stress enough how pleased I was with my Steak! The peppercorn steak was amazing! We asked for our steaks well done! No pink!! Very pleased!
KIND OF FRENCH FOOD I USED TO GET IN PARIS
MY FAVORITE IN THE CITY
Greatly enjoyed both the food and the service on our first visit here
We went early without a reservation and were treated like regulars
The service was there when you needed it and fantastically busy elsewhere when you didn't--just like I like it
The food was well presented and uniformly flavorful--a bit expensive but a good value considering the ingredients and preparation
Highly recommend the Short Ribs Napoleon, Carpaccio de Bison, Steak au Poivre (with the best cut of meat I've ever had in that dish
) and Pate de Maison
Desserts, coffee and kir to start were all perfect as well
Our meal could not have been better
The scallops were perfect! So was the veal, and the pork chops
but the service was horrible from start to finish
I feel like we spent a lot of time and money there
We must have waited 15 minutes for the waiter to bring the dessert menu
then opted for the check
We sat in the garden area, which is a 5'x5' cement square with 2 ficus trees, and too many tables
SIT INSIDE! The food is great - a very traditional left-bank-type French bistro, excellent ingredients, hearty portions
had the Bison Carpaccio - I've never had better
The Duck was phenomenal and DO NOT PASS UP the Coconut Tapioca with Passion Fruit Coulis and Banana Fritter
Mon Dieu!!! Very nice wine list
Aside from the cramped seating and menu on a smudged-up slate, I would definitely recommend this place

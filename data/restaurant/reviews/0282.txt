On the downside: the food can be a bit pricey (an order of cod and chips will run you $7), the portions are 'merely adequate', the food is greasy as they come, the fries are 'chips' not 'pommes frites' meaning they are soggy (though i suppose some people like that sort of thing), the place can't seat more than 5 people, and the air reaks of grease
I know that sides like a lot of negatives but if you put up with all that you'll be treated to some pretty good fried fish and the closest thing to authentic British fish and chips the city has to offer
And that's definitely worth a try at least once
Want to love the place
but hate going there as you come out STINKING of frying
(Extractor fan?)
Extremely expensive too - a 400% premium over Beale's Plaice on Eastenders for example! Have always had decent service at least
overpriced even by ny standards
poor food rude staff not worth the effort, go to park slope or the chipper its closer and better any way
Plain english
SUCKED, SUCKED, AND SUCKED! You're better off fishing in the East river and frying fish than hitting up this hell hole or buying a fish o let value meal from Mickey D's! To sum it up OverPRICED, deceiving employees, and plain old crappy food
The employees need to take a class in 101 'Customer Friendliness
'
I think my title sums it up nicely, tastes bad, overpriced, etc
Dying for some fish and chips one night, my boyfriend and I called in a delivery to this place
I swear the bell rung as we were hanging up the phone
This alone impressed me so much that I would definitely order from A Salt and Battery again and again
Beware, though, that you could literally squeeze out a gallon of grease from the fried goodies, but, boy, is it worth it!
One of the best places in the city for fish and chips that's served to you as it should taste
The fish always tastes fresh, and the chips are tasty
Appreciate their bow to American tastes with the serving of tartar sauce in addition to the bottles of malt vinegar about
Wish the Greenwich street location had more seating like their 2nd Ave location, because one invariably leaves it smelling of grease
Being a brit in NYC I was happy to hear that chip shop was opening, alas A Salt and Battery did not live up to my hopes
The chips were terrible, I had a saveloy that was deep fried (??), and it was just generally bad
Its also a little pricey for some fried potatos
(Note to anyone non-English who has this as their first chip shop experience, a portion of chips in the Uk typically costs around $2, and you get more then what you get here)  I understand that 'Englishness' is seen as a novel thing here, but lets not exploit that by having a very poor excuse for a fine British tradition

Fresh fried Cod! Deep Fried Mars Bar! Boddington's Ale! It's simply the best in fast-food British cuisine
The prices aren't cheap, but the food is delicious
Great Fish!!! Very English (that's a good thing)
Very helpful Staff (East Villiage Location)
Oh boy what a GREAT hangover spot
This place is FRIED HEAVEN
Try the cod and chips
the basic, but it's delish
Especially doused with salt and vinegar
Order the side of curry and it's even better
Mmmmm!!!!
In a word: excellent
I think the best fish and chips I've had in the city, or maybe tied with Telephone Bar Grill
Excellent English atmosphere, and good clean food
Pricey, but come on, this is New York
What were you expecting?
Fresh from the fryer, juicey moist
This also includes the chips
Overall a top gaff
Don't listen to the whiners, going on about the price, even worse, comparing it to English prices
Get real i live in a shoe box, that costs me more in 6 months than my 1st house cost me in England, this is New York!
I've got a good appitite, but i had to admit defeat, i think the fish was related to Jaws, a good portion of real chips to go with it
So get real get down there!!!
I've always loved fish and chips and when I saw that A Salt and Battery opened a branch in the East Village, I decided to check it out
What a disappointment! The prices were obnoxiously high and the fish had an ammonia smell and taste
Now I don't know if they prefer their fish in England on the rotting side but here in America, fish is NOT supposed to have an ammonia smell/taste
It means that the fish is old and better thrown out! For the price and quality, you are better off making fish and chips at home!
Yes it is pricy but its the best fish and chips I've found in the states
The ONLY place I've ever tried that gets it right
Makes me feel like I'm back in London
As for the complaints about no tables
Its a CHIP SHOP! Not a five * restaurant
Its supposed to be take out
Great for takeout fried fish and big old fries
A wide variety of seafood (and other things) available, battered and fried
Service is on the slow side for takeout, but more than made up for by the staff's friendliness and the chipshop ambience
The Scene Philippe Starck meets Shanghai
The minimalist decor is accented by lit-from-behind red and white walls and a wraparound mirror
A large seafood tank flanks the back wall
Downstairs is more tranquil than upstairs, where multigenerational families with lots of kids tend to hold sway
The Food Vegetarian dishes are as flavorful--and more surprising--than meat creations
Don't miss the sauteed fresh soy beans with pickled vegetables, an unfortunate name for a gorgeous toss of edamame (like buttery baby limas), homemade noodles and fresh herbs
Garlicky Go Go roast chicken, with a crackling, golden skin, is also excellent
Definitely go for weekend, made-to-order (no carts!) dim sum
Audacious eaters should pass over the familiar buns and noodles in favor of specialties like briny shark fin dumplings, or the fresh-corn-crunchy white sea fungus
This is dim sum Westernized and sanitized for the masses
It's a little more expensive then the other dim sum parlors in Chinatown
I didn't see one dish of chicken feet, or intestines and forget about shark fin buns or dumplings
The afore mentioned dishes are markers of authenticity for me
To be fair; the food I ordered was good
The resturant was chic although somewhat dark for a place with so much natural light
The staff was great with the girl who sat across from me
This is a good place for a first time dim sum diner with a fear of new foods
very authentic, nice meeting spot!!! some of the best dim sum in NEW YORK!!!
We are vegetarian and enjoy most of the vegetarian dim sum on the menu
Noodle dishes are OK
Service is good and ambience is cute
The dim sum here is only so-so
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here)
The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables
The meat dishes were only so-so
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you
Decor leaves something to be desired
Veronica, the owner is fantastic and will guide you through the experience
I t is the freshest cleanest most beautiful light and yet filling food
It is an absolute delight to go go there!
The dim sum here was refuse
An ideal har gow should have a delicate sheath of skin with just enough thickness to lend texture that supports the rich, briny flavor of the shrimp
Theirs is thick and pasty with flavorless shrimp
Speaking of pasty, the turnip cakes would suffice for glue
The shiu mai were tough, bland, and over-cooked, and the rest of the meal was no better
I grew up on dim sum in Hong Kong and San Francisco, and Dim Sum Go Go doesn't stack up
I'm sick of uninformed opinions about exotic Chinese food here in New York

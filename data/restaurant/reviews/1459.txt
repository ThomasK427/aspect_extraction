I am sticking to them
Thanks Ginger Express for such a nice experience
My boyfriend and I usually go to Totonno's for pizza nights, but last night we tried Al Forno (large pepperoni pie) and it was just as good - if not better! We almost finished the whole thing
we probably would have if we hadn't gotten appetizers
By the way, I ordered an individual salad for $6
95 (you can also order family size for a few dollars more) and it could have easily fed three more people
Ended up taking most of it home with me
Great deal! The atmosphere is laid-back and cute, and the crowd varied from single diners to couples to families with kids
I will definitely go back
I often dine at Al Forno and am consistently impressed with the food and the service
The salads are great, my favorite is the caprese with delicious ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzerella and olive oil and basil
The brick oven turns out great thin-crusted pizza
I recently had a prosciutto and olive which was delicious - great crust too! Pastas and other entreees are well prepared and reasonably priced
The wait staff is very friendly and efficient
Small bar in the back, but only beer wine is served
It smelled heavenly
It looked crowded and it seemed everyone was enjoying themselves
But the food didn't live up to the hype
I know, my fault for rationalizing good taste, but the roasted garlic scent just drew me in
We sat down, and we had to hail a waiter for our menus
Granted it was crowded, but they pointed us to a table and didn't bother with the menus?!! Then we placed our orders and waited for our appetizer
and waited
and waited
It was worth the wait, but the entree was mediocre and even a little dry for a cream sauce
Look, it's a family oriented restaurant
but a restaurant should serve food better than what they can make at home
If you see this place and smell it, don't do what I did
keep walking
i just love posto
it's so fresh, simple and comfortable
always a nice flow of people and never obnoxiously crowded
the pizza is DELICIOUS if you love thin crust
their sandwiches are really good too and they have a nicely priced lunch menu
it has a mellow atmosphere, i always leave happy and satisfied
I have eaten a lot of pizza in this city, I can appreciate the differences in all, and I think that this is the best
Super thin crust with just enough burnt on the bottom
Great selection of toppings but even the plainest one with just cheese and sauce is outstanding
They are super friendly when you call to order delivery, and they deliver fast
They are also super friendly when you dine in, and it has a cute little Italian restaurant atmosphere
Its cool without really even trying to be cool
But it's all about the pizza anyway, which is outstanding
This is by far the best pizza in town
and it doesn't even have the word Famous in the name
Just really good pizza
Great staff
great location
and good price
I cant go a week with out going to Posto
And the topping's for the pizza are perfect
I LOVE IT!!!!
I love this place
the thin-crust pizzas are delicious, the salads are super fresh, staff is frirendly and prompt, and prices are reasonable
I've been here on dates, with groups of friends, and solo for a quick slice/glass of wine
everyone I bring here comments on what a great neighborhood spot it is and wants to come back again
after Posto it's hard to go back to regular, heavy, cheesy slices
and since it's thin crust, you don't feel as guilty when you finish almost the whole pie
It's very old New York with tiny tiled floor, oak bar with old fashioned stools, leather banquettes, real authentic charm
NOT the Disney pre-fab kind
But most importantly, the food is deee-lish! Service is fast and friendly
And they have one of my favorite desserts - brownie ala mode
Being from Europe I felt right at home with Neuhaus chocolates and perfectly brewed cappuccino
I was so impressed with how clean the store was; I really enjoyed sitting and eating my dessert there
I'll certainly be back next visit
If you like ice cream, you will love Emack Bolio's
I had a White Pistachio and Grasshopper Pie ice cream sundae, and I thought I'd died and went to heaven
That was the first time I went
The next time, I had a Mellow Yellow Banana waffle cone that had been dipped in chocolate and nuts: wow! I can't wait to go back again!
If you are craving smooth and creamy ice cream, a great cup of coffee, some gourmet chocolates, or a wonderful fruit smoothie, this Emack Bolio is the place to go! They have the best ice cream flavors; your mouth will water when you look at the ice cream menu
Having trouble making a choice, the friendly staff will help you pick the flavor that best suits your mood
The gourmet chocolates are to die for, and you CANT FIND a better, more healthy fruit blended smoothie with the highest quality ingredients; a much better smoothie than you know who down the street a little ways
After catching a flic at the Film Forum, I sat at a table in this colorful ice cream parlor and loved it! Deep Purple Cow is now my favorite flavor, with Grasshopper Pie a close second
And the coffee is brewed so well, I think it's the best in Soho
This place is a real winner!
eventhough it was a cold winter day, i stopped by for a bit of summer and WOW what a great treat!!!! the ice cream was yummy! classic vanilla and pumpkin on a cone in a cup
this totally made my day
go grab a cone and trust me that delicious ice cream will make you happy, happy, happy!
Great little wine bar just a few short blocks from Bedford Ave
The space is not too large/not too small-which adds to the already great ambiance
The owners are friendly and Peter is very knowledgable about the available wines
Desserts are always homemade and fresh-be sure to try the bread pudding
I've been to N6 a few times and have never been dissapointed
Highly recommend
I had dinner at Cats Cafe on Valentines Day, and it was amazing
They've also got a great bar menu, I highly recommend it!
Just spent Valentines Day with my date at this place and it was great!! Food was amazing I highly recommend it
I've visited New Cats Cafe a couple of times, both on weekends and weekdays
Every single time my visits were never short of a memorable experience
Seating was always available no matter how crowded it looked from outside (and it gets very busy on the weekends)
The food was delicious and always presented well
If you ever have a chance to visit, try the Lychee based drink from the bar called 'Veterok', you wont regret it
I also recommend the Rib Eye steak and the truffles for dessert
My collegues and I went to this charming restaurant for some after work cocktails last Friday
The service was friendly and prompt and the drinks were made perfectly
We also orderd some appetizers but made a big mistake of calling it a night just before the live band performed
Next time we'll make a night of it!
I went here this past weekend for lunch with friends
While we enjoyed the appetizers (kobe beef quesadillas and a mix of fries) the burgers themselves were not nearly as good
Several friends said it was the best burger they'd ever had so we were all very eager to try but were all disappointed
I ordered my burger medium-rare but ended up receiving a burger barely cooked at all
My friend ordered hers medium-well and it looked identical to mine

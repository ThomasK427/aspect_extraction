It was so bad that we complained to the manager (which we rarely do) and thankfully he was apologetic and gave us free desserts
I think this place is overhyped, I've had better Italian in NYC
Who rated this restaurant 9
5??  Appetizers:  - Polpettine Fritte Fried Little Meatballs in the style of Ristorante Da Delfina in ArtiminoLittle
Some meatballs that were OK but a bit dry
Some dipping sauce would have been nice
(I guess Ristorante Da Delfina in ArtiminoLittle is not a big fan of tomato sauce?)  - Arancini Siciliani Fried Saffron Risotto Balls stuffed with Mozzarella Fior di Latte
That translates as 2 dry as hell rice balls served on a paper towel
That deserves a zero right there
(And no sauce could have saved that!)  Main courses: -Arista di Maiale Roasted Pork Loin with Leonardi Cherry Balsamic Mostarda
(Recommended by the waiter)  = 3 slices of pork that looked and tasted like they've been purchased at the cold cut counter, quickly micro-waved and topped with a spoonful of cranberry sauce
Oh, and thanks for telling me it doesn't come with any vegetable
My friend got the grilled tuna
It was average and cut too thin so it was cooked all the way thru
I thought the wine was decent
My friend didn't like it
The service was nice but when the food is that bad
For a restaurant this awful it amazes me that the on site rating is at 9
5
Even a 5
9 is overrated for this poorlly run establishment
Please take my advise and the advise of other patrons do not go to this restaurant
Here is some of what my party and I experienced
Who were are: A table of 4 women venturing into the area to see on off-broadway play
What truly sucked about the place:  (1)Our waiter -- arrogant, rude, abrasive, offensive, greedy and disrespectful
He provided us with our chec upon request after a horrible meal filled with insults
After which we paid cash and left it in the center of the table on the small tray they provide
Not ony did our waiter impose on the dessert we were trying to enjoy to take the money -- he didn't even ask us if we wanted change -- nor did he bring us back any!!! Who does this? He insulted several of the women at our table at one point or another who had questions about the menu -- which if you check out the website is almost impossible to decifer if u are not native Italian or if you don't work at the restaurant
He brought us incorrect drink orders, did not refill any of our drinks and imposed upon our dining experience
The other couple he was serving left after one drink and an appetizer
The rest of the wait staff seemed equally rude
2) The food -- I know al dente -- the pasta was NOT al dente
It was simply not cooked
Chewy, not crunchy and bland
The rest of the food was sub-par
Though one of the ladies did enjoy the Lamb Chops
Portions were small and served like we were cattle waiting to be force fed
Plates were tossed by buspersons and were removed before being eaten
We had to beg them to leave the appetizers on the table so we could enjoy them at our pace
We're eating, it's not a race!  3) Take my advise, don't over look it
Skip this restuarant you'll appreciate the advise
But if you should go -- i told you so
When none of your party takes a card when they leave the restaurant - you know that no one will be returning
The food was no better than average - and the service slow
And if it was slow at 6:30pm, what must it be like at 8:00? One cocktail or wine each, a few plates of appetizers shared and everyone had their own bowl of pasta
$56
00 per person
No coffee or dessert
Too pricey for nothing special food
This much heralded restaurant brought my wife and I some excitement as we walked in the door, but we were met with an awkward maitre'd who barely spoke to us at all and just seemed standoff-ish
The waiter took about 10 minutes to notice us (it was a busy friday night - I give them the benefit of the doubt) and 20 minutes after we sat down to ask us if we wanted anything! Many benefit of the doubts later, we still had inattentive bread and water service, poor timing, missed appetizers, awkward plate clearing (our plates were cleared, replaced with clean plates, and then those same clean plates were removed)
The food was well-portioned, I thought - the smoked mozzarella was great, and the sliced steak perfect
Other than that, the remaining 75% of the dishes were merely above average
Would recommend food only, not service - perhaps overhyped?
I have only a select few places I think of when I think of above average, real Italian food; they have my grandmothers to compete with, this one is one of them
The food is extremely tasty! You actually wait in anticpiation for the next course
I like the fact that the portions aren't ginarmous; people in the States are too fat anyway
However, definitely order some appetizers; the buffalo mozzerealla appetizer is one of the best I've had in the city
I've never had anytning bad here
And I love this street! May be a hassle if not familiar with the Village
My girlfriend and I started with drinks and appetizers at the bar
The bartender was rude
Not a smile or a thank you and a completely inhospitable attitude
The waiter was polite but inattentive
The food at Bellavitae was excellent
The service, however, was poor and amateurish
For this reason we won't return, nor will we recommend it to our friends
The restaurant is popular at present, though I suspect it will not last if it does strive to provide friendlier and more professional service
Give it a miss
Overall, our food was pretty tasty, but the portions are very small
We're used to European portions and a la carte, but felt that overall it wasn't really worth the money
I got the steak with salsa verde
My wife got the black squid ink pasta with calamari
Neither were enough food, so make sure you get a side or appetizer
The bruschetta was basically bread with a ramekin of chopped tomatoes
Not impressed for $9
Outstanding appetizers! We started off with fried meatballs, warm fried bread with prosciutto (favorite) and a mozzarella/tomato dish
Main entrees were equally remarkable
especially the homemade black pasta
Prices are reasonable, probably $55/pp with appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink
Reservations are recommended for a Thursday and probably during the weekend as well
We didnt have one and waited about 40 minutes, but could have been seated sooner if we had chosen to eat at the Chef's Bar
I would gladly return to Bellavita
Came here for a Friday happy hour with my girlfriend
I arrived first and even though the bar was only half full had to wait about 10 minutes while the bartenders chatted away with their friends
Then, they came over as if they were doing me a favor by serving me
The design of the place is nice and there is a separate area for eating
Several tv's surround the bar
Prices are okay, $5
00 for Coors Light and there were no happy hour specials
Not really worth a return trip
I've been here a number of times because it is close to where I work
The food is ok but nothing all that great
The speed of the service varies but the attitude of the staff is rude, more often than not
Recently, they have stopped accepting credit cards for orders of less than $20 because, according to the manager, they are charged $4 to process them (a highly doubtful claim)
Ok I don't even know how to begin, this place is just the worst
Went there for dinner on a date and the service and food were terrible
We had to remind the waiter 3 times we wanted water, it can about 20 minutes after we sat down
Our appetizer showed up 45 mins after we ordered it and after we asked about it 3 times
The waiter said it was delievered to the wrong table

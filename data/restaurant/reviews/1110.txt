Non-vegans will be graciously surprised!
If you care at all about the quality of food you eat (organic food that energizes you and makes your taste buds explode), then Pure Food Wine is a must try
I was leery because of previous reviews I'd read re: bad value
But after sharing a few dishes with a friend, and being absolutely enthralled with each dish (it's the kind of food that makes you stop and chew and savor), my opinion is that this place is not only the best raw food restaurant in NYC, but it's also a top restaurant in general
Anyone who disses this place obviously isn't in touch with the essence of food and the way it's supposed to make us feel
(Looking forward to going back!)
I thought the food was good, but there was a definite sameness to everything that I had -- I don't know if that's due to the use of too many of the same spices, or if I just happened to pick things that were similar
I enjoyed going, was impressed by the ingenuity, but found myself hungry again within an hour of leaving
Definitely worth trying but I don't know that I'd go regularly
I stumbled upon Pure Food and Wine when looking for a place to bring friends visiting from Europe for tea
Not knowing about the restaurant beforehand, we felt compelled to try at least a few of the dishes in addition to our teas once we learned about it
The teas were extremely interesting; I highly recommend going there around 3pm or 4pm for tea and dessert over any cafe
Our dishes were equally tasty, however quite small
The pricing was not unreasonable by any means for New York, $20-$25 for an entree, but it would be impossible for anyone to order that alone and leave feeling satiated
Nonetheless, the food was different and I will likely return
I had high expectations considering all I had heard about the food and how they (do not) cook it, etc
However, when it came to the realy test, it was disappointing to say the least
The piece of lasagna I had was so small I couldn't even get a taste for it
Still feeling very hungry I ordered dessert and it didn't get any better
What was really bad though, was the check
Much more than I thought that meal was worth
Stopped in last night for drinks on the gorgeous patio
The heater allowed us to enjoy the outdoors despite it being such a cold night
Had a fantastic time
The drinks were DELICIOUS - try the pear sake-tini or the mojito
As the food was all natural and raw, the drinks were not syrupy sweet and dominating to the taste buds as most martinis tend to be
The hummus pizza was really delicious
So fresh and despite the small portion - completely satisfying! I recommend highly!
I don't agree with the other negative reviews - this place has excellent quality food, great service and ambiance
If people can't think of anything else than big portions for little money, no matter what the taste and nutrients, then this is not the right place
If you do enjoy healthy and tasty food with some uncommon but very interesting and tasty combinations, then this is right
I've been to many raw and raw gourmet places all over and this one is definintely top
The recently added take-out around the corner is great too
I ATE AT PFW LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME
I ENJOY VEGETARIAN FOOD, SO I HAD HIGH HOPES AS I WALTZED INTO THEIR PLACID GARDEN
THE WAITER OFFERED SOME LAME YARN ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING IS SERVED RAW/UNCOOKED SO AS TO PRESERVE PRECIOUS ENZYMES
WHO CARES! FEW COULD AFFORD TO EAT HERE WITH ANY FREQUENCY THAT THEIR HEALTH WOULD BENEFIT, AND THE PRECIOUS ENZYMES SURELY WONT SURVIVE SWIMMING AROUND IN ONE OF THEIR OVER-PRICED WINES
ANYWAY, THE MENU OFFERED A LIMITED, YET UNUSUAL AND CREATIVE SELECTION OF DISHES MADE FROM VARIOUS VINES, WEEDS AND NUTS - ALL SERVED WITH ZESTY SAUCES
I WAS DISMAYED THAT THEIR WERE NO TOFU DISHES
FINALLY, THE BILL CAME (AFTER WE WERE IGNORED FOR 30 MINUTES) AND I ALMOST GAGGED
IT WAS TWICE WHAT I EXPECTED
THE ONLY WAY I WILL EVER DINE HERE AGAIN IS IF THE PRICES WERE NEATLY HALVED
GOOD LUCK, PFW
I popped in for a couple of drinks and wasn't disappointed
The wine selection by the glass was good and the quality matched
I didn't eat here but the wine alone was enough to bring me back (and I am a carnivore in the Robert Atkins mold!)
Great ambience and a perfect spot to grab a drink if you are waiting for a table at Casa Mono
I have to admit, I was a little ambivalent going in to a purely vegan restaurant, but after leaving Pure Food and Wine I was happily surprised
The food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was to match
The wines were spectacular as was the service
The garden was one of the best I've dined in throughout NYC and overall the dining experience was to die for! High marks for PFW
The food was amazing
anyone can eat this and will love it (NOT just vegans)
The Lasagne Tomato Tartare are two of my favorite dishes, but all the food is great - organic wines were terrific, too
If you like to eat outside ask to sit in the garden, it's really delightful
I found the service to be informative and friendly
I highly recommend Pure Food Wine to everyone!!!
The Scene At this three-story, super-stylized Thai newcomer, the fun begins in the Pool Lounge, where crowds bounce on translucent exercise-ball chairs around a shimmering fountain
Upstairs, a surprisingly coordinated crew of swift, smiling servers navigates tight tables and futuristic wine storage
Diners retreat upstairs for dessert, though the beds with swivel tables aren't exactly comfortable while sharing the sticky, sumptuous chocolate cake
The Food Thai never looked or tasted so modern
Pastry-wrapped soup buns burst with unbelievably rich smoked soy and foie gras; corn-scallion fritters swim in edamame emulsion; pad thai arrives with heaps of sprouts and mango
Entrees, including strip steak zippy with lemongrass-cumin sauce, tiny mustard-basil gnocchi alongside char-grilled chicken and tumeric-rubbed pork swathed in roasted rice, deliver stylish bang for the buck, though meats are occasionally dry
Even simpler dishes are packed with fresh vegetables and fluffy rice
This has kind of been my neighborhood spot for awhile, consistently good drinks, food and service
They just started serving brunch on Sundays, and it has to be one of the best things happening, dining and atmosphere-wise in the city right now
My girlfriend and I have gone two weeks in a row - tried coconut pancakes with coconut custard, lemongrass steak and eggs, a thai breakfast wrap (amazing), and banana french toast
All of it was good, and the scene is really great - they have a DJ playing chill music and they try to seat everyone outside
Not to mention they fill your champagne and bloody marys up without even asking and really make it feel like a party
Love it! Plus drinks are half-priced or 2-4-1 at the bar all afternoon
The mojitos are a super-bargain at that rate
Can't wait to go again this Sunday afternoon!
I hadn't been to Highline since it opened in spring 04 - loved it then, and still loved it when I went back again for a birthday dinner last weekend
Our large party was extremely late, but the staff was still polite and accomodating
We had good cocktails in the Pool Lounge downstairs, which has a mod, all-white decor and a cool fountain
Dinner upstairs has the same mod feel, with a few beds in the center of the room (though they can't be comfortable to eat on) go-go dancers painted on the bathroom doors, and there might have even been a disco ball hanging somewhere - it all reminded me of something out of an Austin Powers movie! The food was OK, and the prices are very reasonable! I'll definitely pay a visit to this cute Meatpacking spot again!
The duck salad and papaya salad were both great
The pad thai spring roll was flavorful but the spring roll dough was too thick
It could have been more crispy if the spring roll wrap was thinner
The duck crepe was also delicious
I chose to go to this place for my birthday
I was highly disappointed
There were 7 of us
We each order an appetizer
Two would come out, then another 10 minutes later, then another two etc
The last two didn't come to the people who ordered them until they already had there food ( in which then we had to remind the staff of)
The staff did not seem to understand a word of what we were saying, w/ exception of the waitress ( who was pleasant), which was quite aggravating
The food had a great flavour, although the steak salad had ONE sliver of steak! The ambiance was cool but we couldn't hear each other talk at all
Highline doesn't take reservations, so be prepared to wait a bit on a Friday or Saturday night
That being said, they do have a nice lounge area downstairs where you can just hang out, have a seat, and relax (no more waiting out in the cold or at the crowded bar)
If you do choose to hang out at the bar, take note that the drinks are horrible (but cheap by NYC standards)
All that aside, the food is phenomenol, and very reasonably priced
While Highline is quite trendy, it's got some odd decor
The second floor has a section of tables, booths against the wall and short beds in the middle! Definitely worth checking out
dinner on 1st floor (street level) a bit noisy, 2nd floor has bed-style seating that is good for dessert drinks (do not attempt to have entree on the bed, what a mess it will be trying to eat rice dishes with sauce while half-lying down)
basement has good bar/lounge (and DJ after 10pm)
decor is interesting and thoughtful, good for groups (ask for VIP room at the back of 2nd floor)
food is delicious and not overpriced
Per person price with 3 course and two drinks around $45 excluding tips and tax
decided to have an impromptu dinner with some girlfriends before heading out on a saturday night

I highly doubt that you would be given a hot washcloth before beginning and sorbet between courses at any other restaurant in this one's price range
Dining at Mr
K's at least once is a must
This restaurant is bad for kids! I should know
I have 4 of them
My kids hated the food, even though it was ok for me
Plus, you should see the way the restaurant looks
No cool decorations
Also, the waiters were busy watching baseball when I tried to call them over
A serious no-no
And look at the price! Oh my god!
Hands down the best chinese food I have ever tasted in my life! Ordering tips- Crispy beef appetizer, grand marnier prawns, and the most incredible duck
Very pricey but do yourself the favor
ONE RAINY SUNDAY AFTERNOON,CASUALLY DRESSED,I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE ENTRANCE WAY OF MR
K's TO KEEP FROM GETTING WET
I PEEKED INSIDE AND WAS TAKEN BACK BY WHAT I SAW-A BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT
I DECIDED TO EAT THERE,BUT UPON COMPLETING MY DINNER,I REALIZED I HAD DINED,NOT EATEN
THE WAIT STAFF WAS MOST PROFESSIONAL AND NOT OVERWHELMING
I WAS SO IMPRESSED THAT AFTER MANY MORE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES,I HAD MY WEDDING THERE TAKING OVER THE PLACE FOR 120 GUESTS,MANY OF WHOM BECAME REGULARS
I ,IN ADDITION MADE A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY THERE FOR MY SPOUSE IN ONE OF THEIR ELEGANT PRIVATE ROOMS
NEED I SAY MORE?YES,THANKS TO THE RAIN,I DISCOVERED THE BEST,NOT ONLY IN NY,BUT IN THE US
the food and services was so good
feel relaxing and enjoy having dinner there
great food, great athmosphere, great time
what more do you want?
Seriously speaking, this place has the most cleanest bathroom i have ever sceen
On top of that, they have this great rice bowl holder that flips open
Man
That was cool
To the food: for a fancy restaurant like that, they give a good portion (didn't quite expected that)
The food tasted like Chinese food with a kick
I'll be back
Mr K's is an upscale Chinese restaurant that offers traditional as well as popular western dishes
Overall the food is very good (although I have had better authentic dishes in places that were not as asthetically pleasing), excellent service with constant utensil plate changes (as is custom in fine chinese restaurants) and great ambience
The high, high ceilings and plush sofa like seats are really what sets this restaurant apart
It is a bit on the pricey side but, then again, you get what you pay for
Went to Mr
K's not knowing what to expect
I had never really dined on upscale Chinese food
I must say that I was more than pleasantly surprised
The place is absolutely beautiful with huge space and large tables with fine pink linens
Service was a bit slow at times but for the most part very good
The food was spectacular
We went with a large group and everyone ordered something different for the most part and they were all very happy
Prices are a bit on the high side for chinese food, but then again this isn't your local neighborhood chinese takeout joint
I love this place
The food is top shelf
prices are high but the quality is outstanding
I would say the interior is a little tired by NYC standards
but I go every time I'm in New York
This was my 5th time eating here and Its always been phenomenal
They have so many unique dishes with fair prices
the waiters are able to help yoiu choose
Definately get the crispybeef for an appetizer and peking duck as well
Its great for private parties as well
Up there with ShunLee palcae
Definately don't miss it
This is my first time dining at Mr
K's
It was a very impressive experience
I had the same feeling my first time at Shun Lee's
The next 2 times at Shun Lee, I was vey disappointed
based upon this visit, they take the quality and service very seriously
High quality ingredients and wonderful spices
Will need to go back to see if it remains as consistant
I love going to this resturant! The food is always fresh and the pasta is fabulous
The seafood here is also excellent! My favorite dish has to be the Tuna Balsamic
It is a bit on the pricey side, but it is definetly worth it for the homemade taste
The proprietoress takes great pride in her dishes that have been passed down in her family
It's a Koser resturant, and even though I'm not Jewish I still keep going back for more
Went here with my wife on a recommendation from a friend
We were greeted warmly when we arrived and were seated promptly according to our reservation
The service was excellent
Our waiter was friendly without being bothersome
The wine selection was good
We shared calamari and a salad to start, both were fresh and tasty
My wife had salmon which was excellent and I had a homemade pasta dish which I thoroughly enjoyed
No room for dessert but we'll try when we return
A very good dining experience
If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal - do NOT order the specials
I figured the specials would be similarly priced to the rest of the dishes, and I could not have been more wrong
My friend got pasta (from the menu) for $21, while I ordered the vegetarian risotto special
I was not told ahead of time that it cost $90 for the bland monotone meal! There was no beef, lamb, crab, lobster, etc
in the dish - not to mention that there were not any sides
The service was average, the meal was subpar, and the servers do not make you aware when you are ordering something that cost 3x as much as anything else on the menu
I went here for lunch with a friend, ordered (2) soups, (2) sodas, and (2) pasta lunch entrees and the bill came out to $80!!! How does lunch cost that much? I wouldn't have mind if the food was exceptionally delicious but it was far from it
The pasta was undercooked and the sauce tasted bitter just like the lobster bisque soup! I would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone
Yummy skewers and mouth watering appetizers, simular to Village Yokocho except this place has a full sushi bar as well
The crab croquette and the chicken skins won my heart over
must try! in my opinion if i had to compare Tatany's 52 and Village Yokocho Id vote for TATANY's 52! because the food seems to be more carefully prepared and tastier as well
Hope this helps!
nice little place but the wait is long during prime time evenings
have patience
the wait is worth a try
the grilled aromas fill your senses teasing your appetite
but throws you off track when you have the urge for sushi
when you finally sit, you have to sift thru the extensive menu so suggest previewing before you sit
many appeteasers! the sushi is very good
but fair warning - so many to choose, so many sound so good
when ordering wantonly, your bill will show it! The SUM IT: a must try but do go early

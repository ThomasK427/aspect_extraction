The manager sent us a complimentary glass of wine for the steak not being cooked like he wanted
Very nice, so the service has either improved greatly, or it was just a fluke
I have been here maybe 5 or 6 times and each time I had great service and good food
Well, judge for yourself, but the fish is worth checking our regardless of everything else
I took my family to the theater and decided to come to Cascina on a friend's recommenation
We were very happy with the sevice and the food
The kids had the pizza and ate it up
I had a piece and it was very delicious
My pasta, the linguine was very good
My husband had the chicken and he really loved it
We had a glass of wine also very good
I had a coupon for 10% off from the playbill, which was gladly excepted, so the experience was great and very affordable
I highly recommend it
We will be back
I'm Chechoslovakian, but my grandmother was Italian, so genetically I'm predisposed to loving Italian food
I've been to Italy many times, so I further appreciate the authenticity of the food in Cascina
I read someone likes the fish, I agree, the striped bass is truely exceptional
I love the Tuscan fish soup, which is so authentic I almost feel I'm back in Italy! The Tuscan fish soup is a special, so they only have it once in a while
They should make it part of the regular menu
Their pizza is another favorite of mine
I have tried almost everything on the menu, except the steak, and have never been disappointed
I live close by, so that may make me a little biased, but I love this place
The ambience is great and romantic
Try it, you won't be disappointed
Hi,  I had the best striped bass at Cascina
I'm taking cooking classes at the Culinary Institut and I can appreciate immaculately cooked fish
To add to fish cooked to perfection, the presentation was equally great
The wine was very good
The waiter was quite knowledgeble, especially about the wines
The homemade strawberry trart was amazing
The restaurant eminates warmth, central brick oven sets the tone, the red walls help
Cozy ambience matched with terrific and beautifully prepaired food
Try the fish!  Sincerely, Val
Attracted by the best of rating, I took my girlfriend here for a late dinner on Sat night, before going out
We arrived around 9
The restaurant wasn't crowded, we got a nice romantic table on a balcony
The food was really good
The brick-oven pizza was out-of-this-world! We both couldn't get enough of it
My girlfriend had the chicken and raved about it
We ordered a bottle of wine
The wine was very good
The wait staff was very good
The dinner was perfect
My girlfriend was thrilled and it was very moderatly priced
I highly recommend it for a late night romantic dinner
I work and live in the area
I drop by to Cascina most often for lunch with co-workers for great pizza
Last week we had dinner there for my wife's birthday
They did a great job, as always
I had the steak this time, it was really good
My wife had one of the specials, a Tuscan fish soup, which was delicious
Everyone was raving about the food
We had a great time
Not only is the food and wine great, but the prices are very reasonable
It's a really great find
I highly recommend it
My grandparents are from Italy, and this place reminds me of my grandma's cooking and the summer house we had there, when I was a kid
There is a big picture on the wall, that looks exactly like the view I remember
I found out it's the picture of their vineyard in Italy
I take my kids here to share with them a nice atmosphere and the heratige
It's a lot closer that Little Italy, but the food is just as good, and the homelike feeling is here
Their pizza is so good, your kids will love it
It is made in the big brick oven in the middle of the restaurant
The waiters and the manager is great
They have my son help them with the pizza
If you have kids, this is a nice place in the neighborhood
I took my wife there for dinner on my sister's recommendation
We went around 8pm, it great
The place is very well decorated, very warm and cozy
My wife really enjoyed the decor
The food was delicious
She had their birck oven pizza, which was amazing, I had a piece
I went for the steak and did not regret it
It was cook just right and very flavorful
They have a very nice wine selection, some wines come from their own vineyard in Italy
We had a nice bottle recommended by the waiter
Service was friendly and attentive, without being overbaring
The manager came around asked us if everything was fine
Just a really nice atmosphere and teriffic food and wine
My sister was right!
What a wonderful find
A great, cozy restaurant with a feel of a vineyard
They have their own vineyard in Italy, where they import wines from
The very friendly manager explained to us the pictures of that vineyard
The waiters were so nice you felt the homelike atmosphere
The food was equally great
I had a wonderful fetteccine, my husband opted for the linguine and loved it
The wine is divine and you can not beat the atmosphere
My girfriends and I walk passed this place all the time and finally we decided to give it a try
I had their pizza and absolutely loved it
My friends all adored their food
The service was polite and prompt, not overbaring, which was perfect for us
We were sitting in the back of the restaurant on the balcony, which gave us privacy and a great view of the place
At a recomendation of the waiter, we got a bottle of wine, from their own vineyard in Italy
The wine was divine, as was the whole experience
To add to a perfect evenning we shared a homemade tiramisu, the best we ever had - that is a uninimas vote! I usually don't bother to write reviews, eventhough I eat out all the time, but this place really deserves applaus
My girlfriends and I will definately be back
I went here because a friend gave me a $25 gift certificate for the place - turns out that only was able to cover about a quarter of my bill
The waitstaff were nice enough, but they forgot to bring things, took forever bringing the RIGHT things, and the steak was too dry
A group of four ate at Cascina

I've eaten at Maison on several occassions and it's usually been for brunch, tonight I actually went for dinner and unfortunately will probably keep visitations limited to brunch only
Have to agree with the review written before me, it was spot on in every respect
I ordered the trout dish and was served a plain looking piece of fish sprinkled with brightly colored chopped seasonal vegetables, average in presentation and bland in taste
Not to discredit Maison completely the Brunch is okay, not exceptional but reasonable and fairly tasty, location is great! If they change the chef and put some effort into the menu, service and evrything else this restaurant could be exceptional, instead it's just plain
My suggestion: Eat Somewhere Else!
I'm sad to report that we also had poor service here while visiting New York City
It appears to be a charming french outdoor bistro, and the food wasn't bad, but the waiters were clearly tired of dealing with tourists, and didn't handle us with care
Lunch on Sundays is supposed to be a lesuirely, pleasurable thing, not something that makes you boil with anger
Maison has the MOST TERRIBLE SERVICE I have ever experienced in any NYC restaurant
It's Merely a Tourist trap that real new yorkers should stay away from
Where do I begin? -4 waiters bustling around though no table was actually being helped -25 minutes to take our order -15 minutes to get the drinks we order -another 20 minutes to get our food -NO apology from the waiter In between our lunch, a man burst out shouting in anger at the lousy service (he asked for ketchup 20 minutes ago and never got it)
Two words: STAY AWAY, or you'll leave feeling cheated and angry
Unfortunate that a restaurant with such a great location abundant outdoor space is plagued with such atrocious service
Went for Sunday brunch in the summer we as well as the tables around us were getting up on our own to get water
Were told that we couldn't get coffee b/c they had run out of cups
Hostess continued to ask us if everything was okay, and then did nothing when we gave her specific actions (how about some water or coffee served in paper cups)
Was the first time I actually left NO tip
Really a shame because the food wasn't 1/2 bad, but the service was the absolute worst I've ever seen
The Scene A comfortable, yet upscale, shrine to the quintessential American snack, the dimly lit, tan- and red-toned dining room serves local businesspeople and tourists who require more than yellow arches for atmosphere
The Food Burgers of all types are the extent of the menu
You can't go wrong with the Rare Classic, a juicy, flavorful beef patty on toasted brioche, or dressier versions, like the pesto-mozzarella burger or the Mexican, topped with spicy black-bean spread, guacamole and chipotle-chili ketchup
Low-carbers can even enjoy a bun-less Salisbury steak with mushroom gravy
There's also a crab-and-shrimp burger and a portobello burger, topped with cremini mushrooms
Experiment with sides: Replace traditional french fries with a basket of "frickles" (deep-fried pickles)
Bottom line:  1) Burgers are mediocre at best
2) Drinks are overpriced
3) Service is slow
4) Everything is overpriced
I have been eating at Rare for a while, and I can't believe that people are writing negative things about the service and the management
I guess people need something to complain about! EVERY time I am there we are treated very well and the food is consistently great! If you're in the mood for a turket burger or a chicken burger, the ones at RARE are the tastiest and most moist I have eaten!
wow
a great rooftop for cocktails with views of the city and then a fabulous burger joint down below
The veggie burger is great as well as the Kobe beach
The sampler of french fries should not be missed either!
Came here for lunch, ordered the Kobe Wellington, medium
When I cut it open, it was blood red, stringy, and basically rare
Asked for it to be cooked a little more so I wasn't eating raw meat
After 10 minutes, a new patty came out, and alas, it was EVEN BLOODIER THAN THE FIRST TIME
The manager comes over and tells me, It's the lighting
You're sitting under an orange light
I was in disbelief
He was patronizing and unapologetic
I didn't want to ruin my lunch break, so I simply asked if they could cook it once more
By the time my burger came out for the 3rd time (everyone was done eating), it was hard, dry and past well-done
Apparently at RARE, they don't know how to cook burgers medium
I have been to this restaurant many times - was excited to have dinner there w/a pal of mine who I hadn't seen for a while
Sat at 6:30pm - ordered a full dinner - drinks, appetizers, entree, dessert coffee (over $100+)
We were rudely pushed out once the clock passed 8pm
Was shocked as I have dined in 100's of NY restaurants/have never been treated so poorly
I complained twice
Their response it's a busy night - you can sit at the bar
None of the people seated near us could believe it either
It's not as though we were lingering -we had just finished coffee and I was polishing off a glass of wine
The night was ruined
The owner is a complete moron
I will never go there again
I am still in disbelief
It's a real shame
i cannot comprehend why some believe this establishment should be considered in the upper-echelon of NYC burger joints
the french fries were good, but the burger was marginal, thus the title of my review
made the mistake of passing by this place and actually stopping in for food
The people were nice but the place is too expensive for what you get
I used to be a regular at Rare, best burgers in the city!!! Sad that the food and service have taken such a turn for the worse
I had a horrible time there over the weekend
The food we ordered was just wrong on so many levels - nothing was cooked correctly
Service was just so bad, I might as well have been at a fast food joint
What happened?
Went to try their burgers after reading Zagat review and was blown away! Went and had a feast
All my friends ordered different burgers and we had to try each other's because they all looked so good
The bison burger was delicious as was the mexican burger
The Ahi Tuna burger was also great
You can only describe their HUGE basket of fries with 3 different dipping sauces as AMAZING
One of the owners, I think his name was Ross, was really nice and the service was great
If you like burgers you have to go to this place!
The place does not live up to its billing and needs new management
This was a very disappointing experience
The burgers were burnt and the drinks were over priced
The whole place is a tourist trap; Citysearch should not give this place such a high score
I was very disappointed after my first trip here, so I tried it again and was even more disappointed the second time around
The burger was overcooked on the outside but not in the inside
It had a burned taste
The fries are decent
And any burger fan should be insulted to be charged for pickles, even if they are from the lower east side
Yet another Manhattan media creation
wow this was the worst
went there for dinner over the weekend and was treated rudely right away by what I think was a manager who was doing anything but managing
service was downright awful, the menu items were not prepared properly, and when we asked to speak to someone about it we were basically ignored by the waitress who did not even ask if we wanted more to drink during our meal if you can call it that
we will not be back nor will any of our friends
The burger was great even though it didn't come with fries
For the price they should include some fries
Our waitress seemed very stuck up, she needed to be a little more friendly and less pretencious
Atmosphere was good but it took a while for our meals to come
First experience was during the lunch rush
The wait for a table was short, but the wait for food was way too long for the typical hour lunch break
The place was packed (we got the last open table) and the main dining area was so loud we couldn't hear the server tell us the specials and couldn't hear each other without screaming
Once the crowd left it was much better
We ordered burgers and a salad (mediocre) and the best thing was the fries
I definately won't bother going there again
Was very happy with the entire experiance
From walking in the door, being promptly seated, very friendly staff, who went out of they're way to serve

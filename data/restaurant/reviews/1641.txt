My group felt ignored during certain times of the evening
The restaurant is attractively decorated but totally lacks an atmosphere partly because of the extra bright lighting
I like to have a cool, fun, or romantic atmosphere when I'm paying these kinds of prices
I have spotted a couple of celebrities eating close by though
I would at most only recommend this place for a business dinner rather than a good time with friends or a significant other
Gotham Grill is widely considered a top-flight restaurant in NYC, and it is for a few reasons
Namely, the space is beautiful, although the tables are set very close to each other and the waitstaff was very attentive
However, we did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated
I also had high expectations for the food, which weren't quite met
While the tuna tartare appetizer was excellent, the ny steak entree was nothing special
Also, the waiter wrongly described a wine I had inquired about causing the sommelier to have to make a trip to the table to offer an alternate recommendation
However, that bottle of wine was comped
Also, the wine list though extensive, featured too many obscure vintages and in particular not enough Napa wines
Due to time constraints, we were unable to sample dessert
The prices were in line with restaurants of comparable quality
Just got back from a super weekend in NYC
Gotham Bar and Grill was one of the highlights of our visit
The first course was absolutely the BEST
The entree was good but not outstanding
Dessert was very perfect
Service was outstanding both in the dining room and at the bar
Definitely will go back again
This is a restaurant not a train station run by the Swiss, plan to make a reservation and be prepared to be flexible (you may have to wait a few minutes for your table when you arrive
)
Food: The rack of lamb was rich and saturated with flavor
The appetizer (pasta of the day) was very tasty, and the Atlantic halibut had a sense of individual style, but was a bit bland
Overall, the food was good
The Gotham Chocolate Cake was superb, a highly recommend for chocoholics
Ambience: The tables offer little intimacy, unless you are seated toward the back of the restaurant
We were seated next to a very loud group of 8, doing business
The Maitre d' asked our neighbors to tone it down four times
And, following dinner, she asked if we would like to relocate for dessert
Wonderful service and amazing food make this place a must try
If you are looking for something romantic, look into alternatives like Bouley or Gramercy Tavern (both excellent choices)
The service appears to be snotty, which is really unnecessary
The entree was good, not outstanding and the desert was great
In general its a nice place but it certainly not in the outstanding class
It's a beautiful place, been there several times with other couples and they never disappoint
Everything on the menu is terrific and now since there's no smoking at the bar anymore every seat is a good one
I want to know who they think they are
We had a reservation but they tell us we have to wait for our table anyway
We wait at the bar for 20 minutes
Even the bartender was snotty
Then we finally ask if we will ever be seated
They give us the option of either sitting in the corner of the bar or waiting another 30 minutes!  I've been there before, and there food isn't worth waiting for
If I want to be treated that poorly I'll just go to a Jean George restaurant
It's like with all money making machine resaturants
Gotham attracts that cramped upper-middle class republican crowd that starts being loud after one bottle of wine
You'll get Fidji water out of plastic bottles served to excellent food
Neither attractive nor interesting people
The table next to us was 3 women in their 40's with a hunky escort
Scary
Very upscale restaurant w/ no dress code
Presentation is excellent and so is the bar
I was seated promptly
The apps were good
Fennel soup was da nuts, Terrine rocked, risotto was bland
Entrees were outstanding Rabbit the Squab cooked to perfection
The Gotham Grill definately lived up to reviews I had read
Very upscale New York
The lamb chops were superb
The goat cheese ravioli was exquisite
Food presentation, ambiance, and service were top drawer
A Must Dine
My favourite restaurant is no more
My daughter took me for dinner last night
The tuna tartare was chunky and toatally bland
The Sweetbreads were burnt, and overcooked
The squab was good but not outstanding as was the seafood salad
My pumpkin mousse tasted as if it had been around for a few days
The service was very pleasant if not observant
This used to be a vow what incredible food place
Now it is what a pretty presentation
At these prices there are many other places that serve better food
It was the night before thanksgiving and my mother's birthday
My sister was flying in to surprise Mom
The staff was gracious enough to keep her arrival a secret by letting us wait at the bar and holding our table for us until she and our father arrived 45 minutes late (delayed flight)
The food was outstanding -- I inhaled the venison chop that was (barely) cooked to perfection and the bite I stole of my husband's duck was equally wonderful
Even though we started dinner almost an hour late, no one rushed us and dinner was exquisite
Every now and then I like to enjoy a lovely fine restaurant and I decided to try Gotham
The service was great! The Captain was attentive polite, unlike most NYC restaurant service employees
The service was wonderful from the minute I walked through the door
I wish I was able to dine there a little longer than I did
The food was tasty, creative and well seasoned
Yes
Gotham is pricey but this is NYC and the food and service was worth the visit
Gotham is quite expensive, but the service and food are flawless
There are no vegetarian items on the menu, but when I requested that the chef make something meat-free for me, he came through with a dish just as delicious and pretty as those my friends were eating
My wonderful boyfriend took me to the Gotham Bar and Grill for my 40th birthday and I was the most wonderful experience! The atmosphere is incredible and the food
selection, presentation, and taste are incredible
It was the perfect ending to a perfect day
I will, someday soon, to treat myself to another wonderful experience there
Very nicely decorated
Very spacious feel
Excellent food with professional but friendly service
The nice looking men with suits doesn't hurt either
This is a pricey place to dine in the evening, but the prix fixe lunch offers superb value
A nice twist is their lunchtime wine menu (all at $20
02) for tasting wines, half bottles, and full bottles
I arrived in shorts/t-shirt after a morning sightseeing, and changed on arrival (my idea not theirs)

Desserts were ridiculously good
I have no idea why they print the menu in Italian only, but the entire experience was top-notch
Though the food was good, (Love the sardines and the papardelle!) I was not impressed with the service - slow
Restaurant automatically charges an 18% gratuity for six or more people
Therefore, I felt that there was little incentive for waiters to be helpful
Clean, comfortable and understated elegance meshes well with an unpretentious, warm friendly atmosphere
Oh yeah
the food! I expected excellent food and Peasant FAR exceeded my expectations! From the delicious, rustic bread to the finishing chamomile tea, Peasant is impeccable
If you're like me and find that paying just a little extra for premium quality food, wonderful ambiance and excellent service is well worth it, than I'm sure your experience at Peasant will be at least as pleasurable as mine
I can't wait to get back again!
Wow, talk about a fantastic ambiance able to mingle higly romantic sophistication with a seductive coziness
Actually, I went with a group of friends taking up a few tables and I was still able to converse with all and feel like I was at a very personal dinner party
Despite this, the place was packe and there was a pleasant background buzz
The german waitress had a sweet accent, but was the only anachronistic thing in the place
Her mediocrity left me wanting more in such a place of exalt
I had the venison and the delicious mozerella to start off
The food was so phenomenal the entire table of 9 was exchanging bites, I had the riquissimo gnocchi, and steak that was equally scrumptious
Overall, the place is wonderful and the owners are fantastic
GO GO GO! (that is if you can afford it)
Saturday night was cold and rainy, and peasant was the perfect antidote
It is nice and dark/candlelit, and the large pumpkins and other fall-y decor, along with the opern kitchen/brick over, made you feel you were eating at someone's country home
I love that they bring you fresh ricotta with the bread to start, rather than just the typical olive oil
The bar is comfortable; the cosmo's are tart and delicious
I had quail stuffed with figs and walnuts on a bed of polenta with chanterelles, and it was so rich and flavorful I cant stop thinking about when I can go back and try everything else on the menu! A great choice for any cold fall or winter night
The atmosphere is warm and cozy yet sophisticated
Olives served at the bar are wonderful
The chef is truly confident as salt service is not included in the table setting
Thought I was entering food heaven until I stepped from the restroom to find a puddle of water seeping from the glass sink in the women's room towards my table
I sailed across the wet, slick concrete floor landing on my elbow; however, the busboy came to my assistance
When the entree arrived, the beautifully grilled orata was not salted and sat upon mounds of thyme
The broccoli rape was tasteless and bitter
I was truly looking forward to a pleasant dining experience at Peasant but now realize why Tyler Florence was in the house that evening
Peasant was in need of a food and service 911
Peasant is not a large restaurant but it seems just the right size for the neighborhood
First thing I noticed was the open kitchen and the brick oven
Start with a pizza appetizer and continue with a fish dish
Chef picks up fish from the Fulton fish market daily so the selection may change from day to day
Good but limited wine selection
Get an Italian dictionary because the menu is in all Italian
You can even take a short walk over to Mulberry Street for some desert afterwards
I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant
The service was a 10plus the waitress was patient and attentive, and the food and ambiance was excellent
When they didn't have the bottle of wine in stock that we asked for they gave us a much more expensive bottle at the same price
I highly recommend the rare lamb served over creamy Parmesan polenta, the gnocchi in a creamy mushroom sauce and the Mango desert was exquisite
this is one of my fave places in my neighborhood
okay, so sometimes their hours of operation are a little wacky, but they make up for it with their fine food and wine
i've read many accusatory reviews here about rudeness at Peasant, but i've never run into that
in fact, the service has always been exceptional
food, ambience, service
wonderful
delicioso!
Peasant is good restaurant with a nice atmosphere, consistent food and service
Their wine list is excellent and their food and service are consistent
The prices are a bit high and the portions on the small side
Great first date restaurant (casual yet sophisticated)
I'm in love! Not with a beautiful italian woman (although that would be nice) but with a beautiful italian restaurant, Peasant
I had the best seafood pasta I've had since staying on the Amalfi coast, the black squid ink pasta with cuttlefish
I'm still craving it! Too bad I live 60 miles away or I would be there every day! Everything at Peasant was fantastico although I have to warn you that the desserts are tremendous! Order only one for the table and split it!
I have been hearing good things about Peasant for about a year now and for some reason never made it until the other night
I'm so sorry I waited so long
The food is amazing and although it takes awhile to order ( the menu is in italian only) it is worth the wait
My old favorite restaurant is Il Buco but I have to admit Peasant has bumped it to second place!
Service and food is not good
I would never go back
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food, as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable
The wine list has something for everybody and is loaded with great half bottles perfect for pretheatre! The best of all we could get a table at the last minute!
This place is by far the best restaurant in New York
The food is amazing, the view is fantastic, and the price is just what you should pay for a place as nice as this one
I'd recommend the chicken with the cookies and creme dessert
wonderful!!
Excellent Service for our pre-show group of three
Food was outstanding with a marvelous presentation
Our 3rd was late but we still had plenty of time to enjoy the fantastic desserts and get to the show on time
Prix Fixe at $43 for most everything on the menu, which is reasonable for this experience in NYC
Tables NOT crowded together
Enjoyable pre-theater dinner
Presentation was very good as well as service
Food was excellent
Wine list was limited
The Scene Frank Sinatra's mythos hangs over Baldoria like 50-year-old cigar smoke, and what unfolds here at dinnertime will have your attention riveted not on the food, but on the rare group of characters--actors, politicians, regular guys who look like "Sopranos" cast members--with whom you share the space
Owner Frank Pellegrino Jr
is the star of the show, and he glides through the dining rooms in a charcoal-gray, four-button suit, regularly crooning verses of "The Way You Look Tonight
"   The Food The soul of the food is simple dishes like fagioli escarola (escarole and bean soup), affetati misti (an antipasta course of prosciutto, bresola, sopresata and other meats) and linguine allo scoglio (clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops in a light tomato sauce)
Presentations are as unadorned and straightforward as you'll find--steaks, for example, arrive as unaccompanied charred slabs of beef, while risottos are spooned out tableside
Don't waste your time
Some people like to think this restuarant is THE place in New York City as they pat themselves on the back
The regulars that go with thier Gucci loafers need a reality check
The ceaser salad wasnt bad though
Although the restaurant wasn't crowded, it took 30 minutes after our appetizers were cleared for the entrees to arrive
Our waiter disappeared for long stretches, and it was very hard to get the attention of anyone else
A 3 course-meal took 2 1/2 hours, including 20 - 30 minutes waiting to get the check after dessert
The food was ok, nothing special
Pasta was overpriced for what it was
The seats in the booth were held together with red duct tape
This is not a hip and urban modern space
It is place you'd find the RatPack
Frankie took care of us at the upstairs bar and directed us to some very fresh oysters and I nice glass of wine before dinner
Walter, our professional waiter, had no problem delivering whatever my friends thought would make them happy
A nice wine list rounded out a great dining experience
The entertainment was great

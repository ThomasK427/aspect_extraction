And to top it all off, the bathroom was dirty
Oceana was very disappointing
Please spend your money elsewhere
Oceana is amazing! My wife had the tuna tartar with horsradish to begin
I had the spanish shrimp which are sauteed out of the shell and served with a cawliflower puree and tangerine! Awesome flavor
The main courses were even better
My wife had the loup de mer (sea bass) with a crouton on it, basmati rice with coconut and a tamarind sauce which gave a slight sweetness to the dish
I had cod for the first time in years, I'm used to cod being bland but here it was served with creamed wheat and mushrooms with an amazing texture adding sprinkle of speck ham chips
Desserts were out of this world I had pistachio semifreddo which consists mostly of pistachio ice cream, the best dessert I've ever had
My wife had the creme brulee also the best ever
Service was just the way it should be: seemless,  Very impressed
I was concerned when Rick Moonen left but this brilliant new chef has put this restaurant on a whole new level
We have opted for the tasting menu twice now and I still am in disbelief as to the talent of this young, Bronx born and raised genius of the kitchen
Oceana comes at a cost but when you add up the food and impecable service you walk out with a smile
The poster who gave it a 1 because they were supposedly not happy with him wearing jeans should most kindly eat at his local diners
Not just as far as seafood is concerned
Everything on the menu is top notch
While the $170 wine pairing is a bit pricey
it's worth every cent
This literally is, the best restaurant in all of Manhattan
The food was delicious and the prices out of this world
The wait staff was too attentive taking my bread plate and appetizer plate away before I had finished
The staff seems to hover just behind you and it made me nervous
There's nothing bad in this restaurant
Appetizers, Entre, desserts-ALL SO GOOD!! Worth going over and over again
New and exciting changes at Oceana
Was delighted to see a full change in menu
Food was incredible, service was perhaps the best experience ever had in a restaurant! Wine list lenghty and fairly priced
desserts are always fantastic here
A must visit!
Enjoyed meals there during the previous chefs' tenures, so I was curious when I arrived for dinner last week
Food and service have not declined at all
This is a first class restaurant
Service is professional, without being stuffy
The food is extremely well executed, if not unique anymore (though I always find the American caviar exciting)
Ambience is comfortable without being pretentious
Only quibbles are so-so wine service, and while Prix-fixe is reasonable at $68, extra charges for additional dishes/tastings can be high
This past Wednesday my wife and I had dinner at Oceana and it had to be the best meal of our life
The Hamachi sashimi was ethereal and the lobster pumpkin ravioli was sensuous
The service was attentive and as it good as it gets anywhere in New York
The new chef has taken Oceana to new heights
Four stars all the way
Overall my experience was hit miss
Some courses/items were amazing; others were not impressive
The service was lacking
We poured most of our own wine
I will think twice before returning
I went to Oceana on Thursday, November 14 and to my surprise they had a new chef
The previous chef and menu were excellent and I did not mind paying $200 and upward for a great meal and wine
However, this new chef, menu and wait staff is disappointing at best
I spent $280 for dinner for two and the waiter acted as if we weren't there
The food, for lack of better word, sucked
Take my advice there are better seafood places in New York (i
e
Aquagrill, Le Bernadine, Grand Central Oyster Bar, and City Crab) to name a few
If you are a dinner who, however, does not mind spending a lot of money in exchange for inferior tasting food and service then you should go to Oceana
Just my 2 cents, which coincidently is more than what anyone, should spend at Oceana
My father and I went to Oceana on Saturday, Nov 9, and must have stayed for 3 or 4 hours savoring our wonderful time there
Each dish contained flavor after flavor, each so unique - a treat for the taste buds
I would go again and again
Such attention to detail and wonderful service
It's a cozy seafood restaurant offers sushi quality fish
The three course dinner includes a high end dessert menu
The dining space is lovely, but the powder room could be upgraded
Oceana, was a great experience from beginning to end
Started off with perfectly mixed martinis while we waited for our party
Service was imbeccable, Maitre'd was attentive, friendly and in general perfect
One in our party doesn't eat seafood, not only did they bring out a lobster bisque without the lobster they specifically brought out a chicken dish for her that was not even on the menu
Keep in mind this is a strictly seafood place
Any high end place that is willing to go above and beyond have got a client for life
Thanks for everything!
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both agree
definitely one of the best seafood places that I've been to
The jumbo lump crab cake was amazing as was the seabass
If you've got a sweet tooth, go for the creme brulee, simply one of the best in town
Granted, it is a little steep, but the service was impecable, the decor was tasteful AND we closed the place out
Well done! I will definitely be back for more
Oh, btw, if the price is not right, go upstairs for the cafe
This is the second time I've eaten here for lunch and it was great both times
Service is impeccable, the decor is soothing (its not as nautical as others make it sound) and the food is perfect
Favorites: crab cakes, ravioli, chilled seafood, tuna
All of its good
Definitely get dessert - delicious, creative, and beautiful (without being too precious)
An unmatchable dining experince for seafood lovers
I liked that the waiter suggested an excellent wine by the glass that was not overpriced, service was excellent truly the best desert I have ever tasted! Worth every penny then some!
Oceana always has an attentive staff that remembers its repeats clients
The food is amazing and the setting is serene
As if dining on a magnificent ocean liner
The seafood spread with the rolls sets the tone
One of my favorites, especially pre-theatre
I'm amazed
Nobody's ever there
Food is meh not really tastey and oily
Dinner for 2, instead of sitting us at a normal table, I got a curve booth when NOBODY was there
So random
Decent price
The food is nothing spectacular, but the prices are fair
Great Thai decor and a cozy atmosphere for an intimate date
Serive is great! Good value
The food was so-so

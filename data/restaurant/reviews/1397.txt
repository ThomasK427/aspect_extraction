So many of us have already found a home here and like Futura, we're here to stay! From having an appetizer, a glass of wine and reading a magazine to sitting by a table to work on my grades, to meeting other fellow teachers for a book club to partying with the owners all my experiences at Futura have always been extremely postive!
What a pleasure and a great surprise! I was apartment hunting in Park Slope, my friend and I needed a place to relax and take in the day
Not knowing much about PS, we decided on FUTURA - for the decour and the menu
I thought moving out of the Manhattan to Brooklyn would be a horrid transition - no way, at Futura I found a friendly and nice staff, a great menu, ambience was amazing, the music not too loud and pleasant; I cannot wait to move to Brooklyn and go to Futura more often
I AM SOLD!
we ate at futura after reading the many positive reviews and were not disappointed
the wait staff is very attentive, the food and drinks are great and you are not being rushed through the meal
i had the gnocci, a seafood appetizer and a glass of sangria, all of which were delightful
good place for a date or a small group of friends
The atmosphere was warm and enchanting, and the staff could not have been more courteous and the service prompt
Still, it was casual, relaxed, and we had an incredible meal! I had the minestrone soup special -- best I've ever tasted -- and the striped bass for an entree was perfectly cooked and seasoned with peanuts and black olives -- unexpected and delicious! My girl had the empanadas and the linguine with clams -- the empanadas were freshly made and perfect, and the linguine al dente! Best dinner out in the slope in a long, long time
Don't forget to try a ZYR martini, a new Russian vodka they're carrying that I'd never heard of before, but made a perfect cocktail
Hope this place stays for another ten years at least!! We can't wait to go back for brunch!
My friends I wondered upon this place while walking through park slope 4 weeks ago, since then we've been back every week
The ambiance is perfect for both a dinner with friends or a date, the food is AMAZING and the waitstaff is perfectly charming
Go there just once, the great food very reasonable prices will keep you coming back
I promise
After reading an article about Futura in TimeOut New York, my girlfirend and i became very curious about the about what Futura had to offer
To our surprise, the food was magnificent
The meat was cooked perfectly and the service was incredible
We will definitely return with our friends
We would highly recommend this spot to everyone
I'm glad we made reservations at this place, it was wonderful
The food was delicious, and the setting was great too
A nice place to visit, I will be coming back again for sure
Would you ever go to eat in a place where the owner and the staff write their own reviews because anybody else does?
I was walking around in Park Slope with my girlfriend yesterday when I saw one place that caught my attention
I saw through the window ,candles and a beautiful bar, I sat on a very cozy couch located near the windows in the front , there was a perfect view of the rain outside and classic jazz as a soundtrack
I had wine, delicious duck and a tasty coffee
I strongly recommend this place if you are looking for a corner to read your book , internet or to just relax listening to a good taste of music and delicious food and drinks
A few nights ago, my date and I were given the pleasure of dining at Futura
I enjoyed a delicious Black Angus Burger, which was cooked perfectly along with fries and a salad
My date mentioned, repeatedly, that the Blue Corn Crepas were Incredible The employees were very charming and the service was superior
The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing
Very nice place, excellent food but you'll pay (too much) for it
It was the best burger I have ever had but I paid 14
00 for a burger and fries and, well, that's just ridiculous
Go for drinks and apps and save your cash
What a find, This place is sexy and the food is authentic and delicious
We started with the empanadas and they were just perfect, Then we had the steak that was done to perfection and served with chimichurri
My date was very impressed by my choice and so was I
This place will become a regular haunt of mine
my boyfriend and i went recently for my friend's birthday party and had a great time!the place is noisy and fun -- not for a quiet dinner, but perfect for parties
it has a very sexy vibe -- brazilian music, cute waiters, etc
i thought the staff was very friendly, and service was good, but the best aspect is the food
my boyfriend had the shortribs which he said were the best he's had, and i had a variety of ceviches which i thought were amazing
we never felt rushed to pay the check and we were there for 3 hours (maybe because we were drinking a lot)
also wine list is great
we would definitely go back
While I regret not ordering anything requiring a tortilla from the Tortilla Performer on Stage, I was distracted by suffering at the handsof the service
While I observed my server having his own drink, it took him 10 more minutes to return to the table to inform me they were out of Tequila
And that's just the drink order
No joke
Unless you live close by, no reason to go
Food is so-so
service still rough around the edges
a B+ restaurant
What a wonderful dining experience
We tried many of the appetizers and were impressed by them all
especially the lobster soup and the calamari
The chef even came over to make sure everything was to our liking
The entrees were even better
I highly recommend the pork loin and the steak
The restaurant itself is really beautiful and the staff is friendly and attentive
It is hip and modern without trying to hard and the food was outstanding
We've been back twice already!
But I made a reservation here for 10, two weeks in advance, to celebrate my birthday
They didn't seat us for 3 hours! We were left at the bar, and the only complementary item they gave us was a bottle of champagne
We didn't realize it would be so long, they kept telling us 20 more minutes - how could one think they could seat us in 20 minutes, but end up seating us 3 hours later? By the time we were finally seated, I don't even remember the food, or the ambience
But it could not be worth making my friends cancel their after dinner plans, and providing me with a less than memorable birthday! Certainly not worth trekking to the area!
This is surely my favorite new restaurant!!! The food is amazingly wonderful!!!!!!!!
What a wonderful restaurant! Even if the decor and the staff and the bar weren't warm and welcoming and hip and charming and fun-We'd go for the food! There wasn't a clunker in any of the entrees and appetizers that 6 of us ordered and shared
The attention to detail whether it's decor or service or menu made us feel fortunate to be part of the Camino Sur dining experience
I found Camino Sur on a rewardsnetwork
com directory (dining for FF miles) at the behest of friends who wanted to eat near Penn Station
We all were thrilled with this newcomer! The ambience, service, and above all else, the FOOD are great
My personal recommendation is the melt-in-your-mouth spare rib
My friends and I look forward to returning
Camino Sur is located on what used to be a theater with some of its features still present in the restaurant
A small stage has been preserved where a beautiful woman makes empanadas to the rhythm of Latin beats
Their flavors are an excellent combination of (mainly) Colombian and other South American cuisines
The atmosphere is cozy and trendy; flavorful and strong caipirinas will get you started into a fun evening
The staff is extremely friendly
Whatever happened to the reaonably priced restaurants where you felt like you were taken care of, not pick-pocketed? Mai serves very good food at reasonable prices in a cozy little space, for not much more than you'd pay at an overlit diner
The monkfish appetizer is quite delicious, and I've loved the curries and noodles
One of the meat dishes (ribs maybe?) was a little spare and dry, but that was just one night soon after they opened
Back when it was BYOB--they serve beer and wine now
Two strikes and you're out - that's my motto for this mediterranean den of sub par service
I tolerated the extended delay to receive my dinner the first time I dined at Olea - and when the food arrived they had messed up the order - but the food was pretty good and I was in no rush - so I forgave them
But on a recent Sunday brunch excursion, I was greeted by a uniformly unfriendly staff - starting with the hostess and extending to foul faced wait staff
We were seated at nearly 3pm - well after the sunday brunch rush - and another unacceptable delay was in store for us
At 3:30pm after repeated inquiries about the food they offered to buy our drinks without offering any explanation
When 4pm ticked by, the novice hostess came to tell us that they could not tell us when the food would be ready
Clearly you jest you're thinking! But I kid you not - the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time
Perhaps they need a crystal ball because this establishment should not call itself a restaurant if they are unable to produce the meals they advertise
This is obviously a result of poor management - surly, incompetent staff cannot run a place to the ground without the manager's approval
No mediterranean warmth, no mediterranean food - clearly a NO from me
I'm enamoured of this Ft
Greene spot, in ambience, price quality/selection
It's far better than most of the other Ft

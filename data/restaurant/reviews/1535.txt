Its rare in Manhattan to find a resturant that you look forward to going back to with out breaking your wallet
I have been to Cafe Boun Gusto Due 3 times in the past two years
Every time I go back, my guest/s love it! The chicken dishes are the best on this side of town! People are nice
We were seated as soon as we walked in
When the check came it was a pleasure becuase our meal was that good! I highly suggest have a nice romantic dinner here or a great lunch
ENJOY!
I first went to a Cafe Buon Gusto in the mid-90s on the upper east side
The food was good and reasonable and the atmosphere was simple, yet elegant
Since it has chained itself, I have been to the branch in BKLYN heights which maintained the formula
The Chelsea branch must be the worst of the lot! It is obviously a neighborhood joint, which is not a fault unto itself, however, the service was horrible, the food was medicore and the bar, playing Billy Idol was loud and tacky! Olive Garden has more atmosphere!
Have the mussels in green sauce with the house bread and you'll never want for anything again
Great Ceaser salad made at your table and veal chops that rival the best steakhouse
It was so good that I married the waitress on the Brooklyn Bridge in May of 2004
This small restaurant near the chelsea area serves some pretty unique dishes not found in other italian restaurants, as they supposedly have added some portugese influence to their food
Their ambiance is rustic, but formal and it's very likely that you will be served by the owner of the restaurant instead of some surly waiter
This is one of those restaurants with the perfect marinara sauce for their pasta, just go for the chicken/calamari pasta, which you will enjoy
NYKT is a great place to go with family and friends
Its not cheap but i think there is a good value for high quality grub
The staff immediately greeted us at the door
one thing i love about this place
the service is impeccable
attentive, quick, and efficient
these people make you feel like a King/Queen
(by the service, i mean) open 24 hrs a day
how wonderful! right in the middle of Koreatown/32nd street, it's a great location
2 floors from where you can watch the rest of Koreatown and a view of crazed shoppers in the garment district
The menu is pretty good, however the prices are very high
it's over $45 to just grill food at your table- i'm more used to $27-$30 and their other dishes are highly priced- but it's well worth it for me
I love their old-fashioned characoal grilling
food is always fresh, always tasty, and always a hit
try the Pa Jun (Scallion Seafood pancake)
We had dinner at this Korean town few times for it's conveniently located next MSG
This one is very similar to other Korean restaurants, no frill with everything within my expectations
My children enjoy Korean BBQ very much hence we go often; especially my son believes he's the chef, :))
My family and I were big fans of the Gom Tang House until yesterday! Bulgogi was not as good as I had hoped AND the service was really terrible
It was my friends' first time going to a Korean place and I felt completely ignored by the waitstaff
It was my birthday and although they came out with of a bottle of bub, I felt embarrassed about the lack of service
The kalbi was pretty good but it did not come with white rice! Also, sitting by the bbq was way too hot

I don't know what the problem was last night but judging from the recent reviews of the other readers, my own experience doesn't seem to be a fluke
I would recommend other places before going to this one!
This place is the one that started the KOREA STREET and as the original Manhattan Korean Restaurant, NYKT really set the bar high for everyone to follow
As such, this place has excellent food, service and, as one would expect at a Korean restaurant, banchan (side dishes)
Every time I come back to the City, I make sure to pay homage to this Manhattan landmark
The food actually got better - probably to keep up with all the competition
I've been a customer of the Kom Tang Soot Bul House for several years
The service and people are always wonderful
Remember to leave your business card, and they'll send you a Gold Card that gives you discount for parking and a discount on your future dining
A Great Place, Great Food, Great Service!!!   ps
If you have Kids, it is a great treat in the city
The main advantage is that the food is cooked over a real wood fire
Also, if you have over 5 people, ask for a private room, it is a unique way to have lunch or dinner with a team
Worst tofu stew in the world
Tofu was all smashed up
Too much squid
Plus, there was a good half inch to the top of the clay pot, it wasn't even filled!  Ban Chan was ok, slightly better than your taste bud deficient grandma might make
Mondoo was ok, but this will make you chubby if you eat too much of it
Went with a bunch of old friends there for dinner
The service was excellent, the food was good and plentiful
The meat was rightly seasoned, and you can't beat the charcoal grill
The restaurant is a bit old and run down but that made it even more fun
Really, it's places likes these in NYC that you find the best deals and good eats
We stayed there for almost 4 hours just eating and chatting, they gave us complementary food at the end
It was awesome
NY Kom Tang is the best place in K town
The other places are always crowded and the service sucks
Not in this place
I was seated right away and the BBQ was delicious
The meat melts in your mouth
In addition, we had a very pretty waitress
I would recommeded to others
Lastly, if you like soup then try the kom tang
This restauratn serves the best Korean BBQ
Marination is prime
Meat quality is excellent
Other Korean BBQ places   The side dishes that come with the BBQ is disappointing compared to some other Korean BBQ places on 32nd st
(e
g
Kum Kang San, Dae Dong Myun Ok)
The waitstaff though overworked was wonderful
Overall: bang for the bucks for Korean BBQ
What this restaurant lacks in atmosphere and decor, they make up in freshness of their fish
They seem to be getting the word out because every time I go in, it is more and more crowded
In my opinion, this is the best sushi in midtown
I recommend the spicy salmon crunch with avocado roll - it is to die for!  You cannot go wrong with their three roll $9 lunch special
Plus they deliver farther than most and the takeout is just as good!
The Scene Featuring a roaring two-story waterfall with a white baby grand piano on top and an eat-in cave below, as well as big-screen TVs, a sushi bar and an occasional bamboo flutist, Kum Gang San overloads your senses before you sit down
Your table will be as loaded as its surroundings, since even the well-priced lunch specials, like the tasty bi bim bap, come with soup and several tiny dishes of banchan--a complimentary feast of assorted Korean appetizers
The Food Mini-barbecues in the center of each table allow hands-on diners to grill their own meals to perfection
Try a bottle of soju, potent and sweet Korean rice wine, with the finely marinated seafood combination, a mix of lobster, squid, shrimp, scallops and clams
Or grill up some bul go ki, rich and flavorful thinly sliced rib eye steak that shouldn't be missed
As a Korean American, this is by far my favourite Korean restaurant in the city
I was so excited to know they have a location in Manhattan
The service may seem rude to Americans - but it's just a different custom
The service is fast, efficient, and on point
The food is always consistent
The vegetable mandoo (fried) is a great appetizer, as well as the pajun pancake
Of course, it's known for the Korean BBQ but there are so many other delicious dishes to try (ie
gop dol bimabap; tofu jigae, etc
) Great place to get a quick and filling meal

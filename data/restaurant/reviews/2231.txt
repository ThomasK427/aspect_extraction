And when not gorged on the buns, there is much to rave about on the regular menu
As a Chinese, I am ashamed to ever have eaten at Joe's Shanghai
If you've ever had REAL soup dumplings, you'll know that they are NOT oily and greasy and fat laden like the ones at Joe's
Instead, they are supposed to have a translucent almost paper-thin skin (not lumpy thick dough like Joe's), savory watery broth (not pools of oil like Joe's), and succulent flavor (not salt and sugared up for the American clientele)
No wonder you see so many unassuming white people here! Joes' dumplings are the equivalent of chicken McNuggets--no real Chinese would be caught ever liking these
This place never disappoints
As I cab it to Pell st
, for the best soup dumplings in town, my mouth waters
It is a must that I have one of ea
kind (crab soup dumplings and pork soup dumplings) or I crave them for the rest of the day
As you bite into the dumpling the hot soup bursts orgasmicly in your mouth
The flavor is indescribeable and anyone who tries is a fool
Other goodies are the shrimp noodle soup and crispy fried duckling
The service is short and inattentive, but who goes to chinatown for either one?
Too crowded
same food in every Shanghai restaurant in Chinatown
The dumplings were cold and the waiters were rude
Very dissapointed
Small, crowded, but excellent food! It was worth the wait
Try the pork buns
In my view, the most important aspect to a good chinese restaurant is still the food
Although this is not the most attractive restaurant in terms of ambience, decor and service, it is by no means a shady restaurant
This respectable restaurant has some of the greatest Chinese dishes in the western hemisphere
The steamed dragon buns are second to NONE!!!!!   If you are looking to wine and dine that someone special in a chinese restaurant, this is probably not the place
Chin Chin's and Mr
K's are better choices
However, if you are looking to enjoy real authentic great chinese cuisine, this place definitely compares favorably to those expensive traps
Joe's is quite an experience
Just look at all those people waiting outside to feat in an unadorned space of cramped shared tables? Why? Because the food is fantastic
Stick to Chinatown or Flushing locations and avoid Midtown
Real ShangHainese dishes! The best soup dumplings
They also provide a wide variety of authentic appetizers
When it comes to Chinese food there is no comparison
Joe's Shanghai has the best dumplings I have ever tasted
It doesn't hurt that it's located right in the heart of Chinatown
This place is a must
If you want authenticity, go to Joe's Shanghai
This is a typical family-style restaurant where you share tables, the noise is astounding and the food comes piping hot and is absolutely delicious
This is the closest thing to a home-cooked meal I have found
Shun Lee Palace and other, more expensive, restaurants have nothing on Joe's
In fact, they tend to add more MSG and the atmostphere tends to be more stilted
It's worth the wait!
The Chinatown location is a must go to! Packed tables at all hours but definitely worth the wait! The Sesame Chicken is to die for! Just go!
We haven't eaten here, only had the takeout, but it's the best most reliable Chinese food in our neighborhood
The Best Soup Dumplings in the city
My other favorites are vegetables with bean curd and fried rice cakes with pork
Gotta try all of them!!!
The staff were very helpful in taking the time to recommend dishes, and explain the elements of lankan cuisine
I recommend the hoppers, and the excellent wattalapan dessert! Devilled potatoes were rather hot!!
Being a Sri Lankan, I came to this restaurant expecting good things
ANd I made the mistake of bringing my mother
awful and overpriced
please don't think this is a representative sample of good sri lankan cooking
i would suggest a wonderful little restaurant instead that no one really knows of --Lucky Sevena---it's up 6 flights of stairs with awful decor, but the owner doesn't have a lot of capital as of yet, but he definitely invests in the food
get off at 34th st
and wander around --across from the big skyscraper there--forgot the name---restaurant is on top of a nail salon
food at luck sevena is under $12 too! DON'T waste your money on taprobane
As a New Yorker, we're trained to like pizza; all sorts of different pizza
IThis pizza is more the traditional European style with a very thin crispy crust and fresh mozzarella as opposed to the shredded American kind
One pie is good for 2 people if you're hungry, if not, then 3 people will devour the 6 thin slices quickly
Its quite expensive at $16+ per pie, but its certainly different from other places and I often regret getting pizza anywhere else
If you're expecting a thick fullfilling slice, then this place is not for you, this is more of a gourmet pizza
The rest of the food on the menu is good, but not as notable as the pizza
Classy Joint!!! Thin crispy crust, not to saucy, they use kalamata or Italian olives other fresh authentic ingredients
Wouldn't go back to NY without indulging in Angelo's pizza
Don't miss out -
I have eaten at the restaurant before; it's fine - as good as Patsy's, but pricier
Unfortunately, the management is not service-oriented
I had called the day before I planned to place a big order to make sure they could deliver it, and they assured me they could
The next morning when I placed the order, they said they could not deliver because I was two blocks (northbound) out of there range
The manager wasn't even apologetic! I was left in a lurch, and they couldn't even extend the courtesy of walking two extra blocks when one of their employees had told me they would! For this reason, I will not be going to Angelo's anymore
This place gives Patsy's a run for their money
The staff is so much friendlier and the pizza is the best
This place also has a full bar, unlike most of the pizza places in NYC
Truly one of New York's hidden treasures
Ever since i've discoverd the place
I have not been back to patsy's
Consistently delicious
The coal fired, thin crust pizza served at Angelo's is about as close to perfect as humanly possible
The crust is wonderfully crisp and tasty, the sauce is zesty but not overspiced, and the cheese and toppings are as fresh and mouth-watering as any I've had
I recommend trying the simple Margherita pizza to savor unadorned New York style pizza at its finest
To start off the waitress was very friendly and helpful
The bread we got before we recieved our food was awesome! I highly recommend a thincrust pizza with proscuitto, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and onions
the ingredients are so fresh!!
We visited New York and stayed at the Parker Meridien hotel
Fortunately, Angelo's pizza was directly across the street
For thin crust, coal oven pizza Angelo's is great
We ate at Lombardi's during our stay too and Angelo's was as good or better than that
We were able to be sat right away, and were immediately greeted
They brought us bread while we waited
The food was definitely excellent
The best pizza I have ever had! Just a little warning, unles you have a huge appetite, share
The portions were huge
The food was great, we had a salad and a small cheese pizza
They brought us rolls before the meal which were good, and the coal oven pizza was some of the best thin crust I've ever had
It was a bit expensive though, but it was quick and the food made up for it
Great for pre-theater
This pizza is fabulous - right up there with John's, Patsy's and the greats
Fabulous thin crust
Fresh Fresh ingredients

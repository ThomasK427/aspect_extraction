The food is fantastic, the service is very attentive to detail, the decor is hip and trendy, yet it is not stuffy in the least
The owner came by to personally introduce himself and later made a recomendation for the wine we had with dinner
We had the lobster salad, follwed by the ravioli and finished with some prime rib, all cooked to perfection and served in a timely fashion
PERFECT and no wait!!!
What a dissappointment!! The service was some of the worst I have ever experienced
The food was good, not great, and for the prices they charge it should be better, much better
The room and ambience are dreary and dark
The wine list is mediocre
It is clear the chef has talent, but this is not the platform to demonstrate her skills
After my second visit, nothing has changed
I arrived in the uncomfortable time between lunch and dinner and was welcomed immediately
The wood-burning stove and the baroque mirrors make this a sophisticated place but there's no pretension or attitude
The food was similar--fresh, creative, but also hearty
I especially like the fresh cheeses they use
Make sure you try the baby gnocci and the salmon--and the rich tiramisu
This is Northern Italian fare, so the place is free of red sauces that can drown flavors
Especially recommended for people dining on their own or between hours
Their dinner Restaurant Week menu was the best of the five places I've sampled
Enjoy!
Excellent food and service
Decor is simple because they focus on making great italian food
I highly recommend trying arezzo
Food was excellent, as was wait staff
Ambiance was good, but overall a very pleasureable dining experience
On the recommendation of a friend, I checked out Arezzo with my wife
I'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly, courteous and efficient
While the food at Arezzo was very good, the service was absolutely abhorrent
We waited 1/2 hour between our first and what should have been our second course, only to have the waiters skip the second course and bring us our main entree
When we mentioned this oversight to our waitress, she mumbled an excuse about the kitchen being busy but then apologized and said she'd make it up to us at dessert
Imagine our surprise when we received the check and found that we were fully charged for our dessert! Although the food was good, it was a pretty disappointing experience overall
What a great little place
The food is out of this world and although the decor is kind of plain, it has a really relaxing and comfortable feel to it
I went with a group of 6 and everyone liked everything they ordered
Harrison Ford was there the night we went
Really, the food was not impressive
I didn't have a bad experience, I just didn't think the food was all that good
I will not return again
Upon walking to the restaurant I knew I had made a good choice
Hostess was very pleasant and the ambience was fantastic! Food was great
I recommend the Pea Flavored Cavatelli
One of my new favorites!
Absolutely without a doubt amazing food
Margherita is a genius! Expensive but well worth it once in a while for that sensational cavatelli with ragu dish
I have been to Arezzo many times and just LOVE it! It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in New York
The staff is so nice and polite bartender Noel is excellent at taking care of her customers, too
Chef Margherita is one of the most talented on the planet
The food tastes excellent and it is beautifully presented
Everything on the menu is worth trying at least once, from the calamari/zucchini appetizer, to the homemade cavatelli, to the rib eye steak (like butter!) to the warm hazelnut cake
Go and ENJOY!
I guess I ordered the wrong thing because I wasn't impressed
I altered the main course -- the gnocchi
I asked for red sauce instead of the cheese sauce
The red sauce was horrible
They were very accomodating though
I then got the butternut squash ravioli which were good
I got the warm chocolate cake for a dessert and that wasn't good
I will give it another shot because I've heard so many good things about this place -- but not for a while
This is one of the best meals I have had in the city
I hhave been there on a date and with a group of people and thte place works well for both
The Salads are wonderful and the pizza that comes out of the briick over are excellent
The entree pastas are huge and the Steak is better then most steak houses
Don't miss this one
Arezzo is probably my favorite restaurant in NYC! The food is amazing
very creative
The atmosphere is great for almost any occasion! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great Italian restaurant
arezzo has fantastic food!! this is a restaurant that really wants the food to be the star rather than anything else
the wait staff is educated and very helpful
have eaten here many a times and there are always new things on the menu, so much so that it's almost hard to make a decision
the foccacina rabiola (appetizer, like a pizza with rabiola cheese and truffle essence) is to die for and i can't find it anywhere else! i have to say that arezzo isn't the place to go to if you want to have a quite conversation, so be forewarned
this restaurant is not cheap but it is worth every dime you spend
it is very lively, truley gourmet italian fare
Bravo to the chef!!!
Those of you who are sick of the standard Italian fare will be blown away by the food at Arezzo
Everything, from the appetizers to the desserts was excellent and the service was very friendly
We've been there a few times and each time, the chef has come out of the kitchen to chat with dinners - a great touch
My wife and I have been called restaurant snobs and we have nothing but great things to say about Arezzo
If you're simply tired of standard Italian fare and are looking for simple yet exquisite Tuscan cuisine, please do yourself a favor and go to Arezzo
Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection; not only is the service impeccable and friendly, but the wine list is also varied and interesting and won't necessrily force you to work overtime
The secondi will not subject you to extreme heartburn either, to say the least
l The Osso bucco I had was by far the best I've had in nearly a year, which is saying much in a city where restaurants serves it frequently but rarely well
OK, so it's expensive, but worth every penny
I promise you!! Oh, and
my wife and I loved it, in case you hadn't realized
We walked up at 7:30 and took the last table
My general rule is not to take visitors from Tuscany out for Italian food (especially if they are over 60 years), but, I gave this place a shot
Nonni and loved it! Wine, breads and oil, salads, main courses, espresso and desserts were excellent (everyone had some of everything - veal chop, Piedmont ravioli, risotto, and fish of the day - all perfect)
A great place to bring a date or friends
I can't wait to revisit
Prices were definitely acceptable - not too high
The Scene Euzkadi exudes the sort of cozy, bohemian charm of a small neighborhood bistro one might happen upon in Paris
The spare, woody space features closely spaced tables, brick walls and high ceiling fans
Service is warm and attentive
The Food The kind of rich, rootsy cooking on display at Euzkadi makes for ideal winter-mood food
Dishes are graced by pungent, big-boned ingredients like garlic, cheese, olives, sweet peppers, capers and tomatoes
The Basque region's proximity to the ocean makes seafood a natural; dishes like bacon-wrapped trout with tomatoes and a crispy bacalao (salt cod) cake are both good bets
Other highlights include a gutsy roasted chicken with olive mashed potatoes and sliced sausage with mustard and lentils
Tapas were the reason why I initially came and will be the reason why I'll be back again as they were delicious and inexpensive
This place is a quaint, neighborhood friendly place that is small in size, but huge in character
Interiorwise its dark and not that well decorated and the bathrooms are not appealling
The food was not portion friendly, but the prices were decent for what you were getting

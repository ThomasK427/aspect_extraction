It amazes me that this place has such high ratings
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
The service was slow


it took almost 20 minutes each time we ordered drinks, even for a glass of wine
The food was sub-par with prices that rival the top eateries in New York
We ordered an avocado salad as one of our appetizers and it was served in a tea cup size bowl
In addition, an order of Naan could only feasibly serve one person
If you're looking for good food and great ambience, go somewhere else
Was able to get a 9:15 reservation, day of (on a Friday) as the hostess on the phone was very helpful
We had a few drinks at the bar downstairs which were excellent (and I really loved the stemless wine glasses) and we were then promptly seated upstairs at a great table by the window
The 3 course price fixe was a good deal considering the quality of food and service (relative to NYC)
Crabcakes, Yellowfin tuna hamachi, shrimp sea scallops, and the beef
all excellent
The waiter recommended a fantastic bottle of reisling as well
Overall a great NYC culinary experience
I have always been to Bread Bar and finally tried Tabla after much hesitation
It was worth it! The food is definitely fusion and creative
Potato/Apple tikki was mindblowing! Sea bass was good - one too many mushrooms in that dish as well as one of the vegetarians dishes
Yet all dishes were very favorful
taste of India in a subtle but not too subtle way! The Brioche Pear bread pudding was awesome - and I don't even like pears! Kulfi was good as others mentioned
Service was awesome
did not see any kids but really - so what if there are a few kids around
the food was great and so was the service and ambiance
If you want to spend a Sunday evening at a restaurant with little children running around and crying at their table - this is the place
I would expect to go to a restaurant of this supposed caliber and not have to deal with such an issue
Not to mention the service was horrible and the food - mediocre at best
Honestly have never experienced such dissappointment at a restaurant
I'm getting a bit tired of 'fusion' food, but this was a nice surprise
The bar's signature cocktails are great (the bloody mary works really well as a prequel to the food)
The food was very nice
There were places where the sauces were overpowering, but overall it was very well thought out and thoroughly enjoyable
I highly recommend the dessert specials
I was served a pear and huckleberry tart with caramel that was great
Paired with the accompanying glass of Muscat, it was fantastic
Tabla has one of the most creative menus in the city, packed with daring flavor combinations and top-notch ingredients
It's true that this is not authentic Indian, but does New York really need another curry place?   My first course, a moist crab cake garnished with tamarind chutney and avocado paste, was staggeringly flavorful
After extensive deliberation, I finally decided on an entree of suckling pig, shaped into a sort of square pork pie with a smoky crust of skin on top
It was served on a bed of lotus root and kimchi, the bitterness of which offset the sweet pork in a sublime balancing act
For dessert, I devoured a custardy sour cherry clafouti topped with a scoop of silky lemon verbena sorbet
Tabla is worth the $80 tab; I would recommend skipping the downstairs Bread Bar and instead going for the whole shebang upstairs
Your palate will thank you
Unlike the previous entry, I went during Restaurant Week and had a great experience
We went early (6:30) and it wasn't as packed yet and we had complete attention from the waiter
They didn't try to rush us out of there either
The food was great and very flavorful and the bread and dips in between the courses were a nice treat too
I think it was a great deal for restaurant week
The restaurant is neatly designed inside and smells great right when you walk in
Went during restaurant week so granted it was busy
The food was good, not great
The service was pathetic
I had to ask the waiter a couple of times to clear our empty glasses
The waiter confused our order and they were not attentive
I have never written a restaurant review before but felt compelled after my experience
This spot is Hot
Great food, Great Fun, Great Drinks and a Design Atmosphere
The design is cool and trendy with ethnic accents
The food is incredibly tasty, well presented and the Indian fusion makes it some of the most exciting food that will ever hit your taste buds!  You MUST try a Tablatini or 2 or 3!!! Great Pinapple/lemongrass infused martini, that hits the spot everytime
Tabla is great for friends and fun, great for business and also great for a romantic date
There is little if nothing wrong with this place
Well done!
ive heard so much about tabla for a while
i had no idea until we finally made it there for dinner, on our last nyc visit, that the place is owned by the gramercy tavern people
which is one of our favorite restaurants
the one thing i didnt realize, until we sat down, is the upstairs is a set menu
downstairs is the casual ala cart menu
still, it was well worth the price
the food is wonderful
and the kumquat mojits, im ready to fly back to new york just for those and for the baked lamb somosa!
Table is a great restaurant
That said, it be the number 1 Indian Restaurant is a bit misleading
The cuisine at Tabla can at best be classified as fusion New American with a touch of traditional Indian spices/flavor
I went into Tabla with big expectations after having dined at Eleven Madison
The food was a bit disappointing and it had way too much cilantro
I am a big fan of Danny Meyer, but this is certainly not his best
Stick to Gramercy and the like
Fantastic service
Everyone from the hostess to the coat check attendant to the waitress displayed professionalism and care
Food was far above my expectations given the fact that it was a busy lunch day during Restaurant Week
Go already!
Tabla gets it right, and the service and ambience were perfect, however, I expected the food to be slightly more adventurous
Overall, this is a great place for a date or a romantic dinner
Tabla is a special occasion restaurant for adventuresome people looking to try something off the beaten path
In other words, conserative types craving simpler things like grilled chicken or salmon probably would not appreciate Tabla's distinctive and unusual menu
I found the food to be as delicious and unique as the colorful decor, with a staff as friendly as they are knowledgeable
Highly recommended for anyone wanting try something new, different, and deliciously unordinary
This was by far the best meal I have ever had
We went for our anniversary and had such a romantic and delicious dinner
We both got the vegetarian tasting
Not on the menu, but they will gladly prepare you a special, just-for-you, tasting if you request it
It was delicious and so special because we were the only ones in the restaurant who got to have it
My husband loved it, even though he's a real meat eater at heart
The service was excellent and overall, one of the best dining experiences I have ever had
You must try it!
my momcame to visit me from oregon and we had seen tabla on the food network on rachel rays show
we decidedto try it and were SO glad we did! we sat outside and the food was great
the vegtables were bought fresh from the grenwhich village market and the service was wonderful
it was nice to sit outside and see the park and all the taxi's for my moms first time in the city
i highly recomend it for lunch or a light dinner

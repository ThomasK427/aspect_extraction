It was a very disappointing night, one that was meant to be special
I will never go there again or recommend it to anyone
I would like to share a great experience I had recently at SCG
My firends and I went there for the first time and what a blast we had
The atmosphere was great
We had a few drinks at the bar; we were sat promptly at our table, ther server was polite and courteous and the main reason for my review is the food; it was incredible
We cant wait to go back for a romantic evening and as a group later
I strongly recommend this restaurant
As a restaurant it is pretty good
The prices are okay but the quality is pretty good
As a bar, dont' bother
Older, unattractive men trying to win over yourng beautiful women with their fancy cars and cash
How you doin'? must be the most common pharse here on Wednesday's
The food here is ok
Not NYC seafood, but decent NJ seafood
I did enjoy the bar, but there are way too many wanna be John Gotti disciples there on Jazz night
So, if you're into the greasy, muscular crowd, check it out
Oh, their service needs help
The food is all home made on site
and is excellent
Its a great place to go for families and with your partner
I wouldnt recommend it for a first date
only because it doesn't have a romantic feel
Service is okay
but overall I go there quite often and time and time again
the food is outstanding
Familyn dining can be found here in a no nonsense traditional diner restaurant that is more than meets the eye, or initial expectations
Family owned and operated for more than thirty years, the people here are local loyal patrons who have been coming here for two and three generations
Reportedly a fixture in the town, the populace treet it as a central meeting place for impromptu get togethers and the occasional celebration
The hospitality is quite accomadating, without being intruding or phony in its sincerity
All you have do is ask, and this place will try to help or you can dine here in annominity without intrusion
Supposedly this has already been discovered by local celebrities in that reside or frequent the area
Fast service, quality and consistent food are the hallmarks of this place
Jerusalem Pizza is a kosher pizza restaurant in the heart of teaneck
The pizza toppings are off the beaten track but very tasty
I enjoy their eggplant pizza
They also have falafel and isreali salads
Very tasty
In Short A pink and blue color scheme, white tile floors and hacienda-like arched windows combine for a subtle Southwestern motif at this fast-food chain
Founded in Southern California in 1962 by Glen Bell (who invented the pre-fab hard taco shell), this casual order-at-the-counter Mexican restaurant features classics like tacos, nachos, quesadillas and burritos
In recent years, menu offerings have expanded to include specialty items like gorditas, chalupas and cinnamon twists
Taco Bell is my favorite fast-food place!! where else can you spend $5 bucks and have a great Mexican style meal?? plus they have free-Pepsi refills!! it's awesome!!
The staff is incredibly rude at this location
I go to other Ranch 1 locations, and never have a problem, but this one is terrible! Also, their bathroom is always 'out of service'
They do not know the meaning of customer service
I am surprised more people don't know about this place! It's one of the few good places to eat in this neighborhood
The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious! The decor was the best part
very modern and cool-looking
We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience!
We've eaten there 3 times and always had a fantastic meal
Good service and great value
Contrary to the horrid response given by the other member, I didn't find O'Reilly's pub to be that bad at all
Granted I did go in there because my last name is O'Reilly, the food was pretty good, the service was acceptable and it was an enjoyable time
The only bad thing I have to say was that it was average on all levels, which is really not that bad of a thing to say
I attempted to have a nice dinner here, only to be completely shocked and disgusted by the rude and hostile waitress
I could only stand this woman for five minutes, after which I walked right out of this place and will never return again
For a place that takes the effort to place tablecloths and silverware on their tables, they should really re-think who they're hiring as their waitstaff
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
Years ago, I used to go to TGIF and have a good meal and time
About a month ago, my wife and I went to this one; what a disappointment!!!!! Extremely overpriced for below average food
No wonder why they do not post their menu anywhere, only after you are ready to order!!!! I will never go there again
We went to TGI's as it was across the street from our hotel
The food was appalling
Baked potato was stone cold, the service was very unfriendly, the restaurant was very noisy, and it was very expensive for what it was
Only go here if your starving and can;t be bothered to cross the street to go to the Tick Tock Diner
When did TGI Friday's become hell? I'll tell you
Over the past year
'Twas a beautiful wintery day in the heart of Manhattan whence we stumbled upon what we once knew to be good food at reasonable prices
We were seated, apparently in the screaming children's section, and much to our discontent found the menu to be both stunted and extremely overpriced
If I'm going to pay $50 for lunch for two people, I could just go across the street to Tir Na Nog
Anyway, back to the point
We finally got our order in and two different waittresses tried to give me french onion soup when I ordered a salad
When we finally got the right food, the breadstick was soggy and right out of the fridge and the sandwich and breading on the shrimp were soggy as well
Still reading? Still considering eating there? Good luck sucker
Imagine yourself in the center of Manhattan, the cultural and culinary center of America
You have hundreds of varieties of cuisine at all price ranges within walking distance
Given these facts, why would anyone honestly wait 30 minutes to sit in pre-packaged atmosphere, eat average (but overpriced) food, and be bombarded with opportunities to buy the same souvenirs they offer at the TGI Friday's across the country? Those who eat there are most likely victims of marketing
This resturant is very beautiful
I went her with a couple of friends the people were great the food and the survice was even better
I would recommend this resturant to all my friends because its just that good
oh yea the prices were just great
The menu is huge and the food is always what you would expect
Can't go wrong with TGI Friday's
Decent food at decent prices, which is hard to find in midtown
Service is good, sometimes too good--they get a little overzealous with the drink refills, but that's certainly better than the opposite
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried starbucks coffee before it became well-known and had thought great
Too bad I didn' think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabolous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and servive does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never dissapoint you

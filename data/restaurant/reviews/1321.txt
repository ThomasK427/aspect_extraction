After asking 4 different people for the Check, I finally gave up, and went to the manager to get it myself
Maybe they just haven't got their act together yet, but it will be a long time before I give them another chance
Been there 3x already in 2 weeks! Friendly service
Amazing space! Colorful, multi-tiered terrace with 2 lovely cabanas, huge brick high-ceiling dining space inside decked with a full bar trimmed with rotating monthly art exhibits lends itself to a Raiders of the Lost Ark look
There is also a cool lounge space beside the dining room that's good just for chillin' listening to live jazz or as the evening progresses rockin' as the DJ's spins
Appetizers are wonderful, esp
the hummus, crabcakes, lentil patties, grilled calamari shrimp
The Turkish pizza is all dough leaves nothing to be desired the avocado salad is really guacamole
The winner is Kadayifi Alabalik, a deboned whole sea trout wrapped in fresh shredded wheat served with tomato basil sauce greens
It was so tasty, fresh rich! The lamb dishes are succulent!
My Moon spent all their money on an architect/interior designer and forgot about the chef
I got the $15 shish kabob - 4 tough miniature lamb bites and turkish pilaf (My Moon Turkish Pilaf Recipe: Uncle Ben's Boil-in-a-Bag Rice)
It feels bad to be cheated, please don't eat here and help these people go out of business soon
A great little restaurant with a variety of uncommon recipes and well priced ,too
I found a special red sparkling wine(Gragnano) by the glass( i think from southern italy) absolutely fantastic in its summer bubbliness
that italian cookie platter was also wery fresh and unusual(a cookie made out of polenta was superb)
You don't have to go far if you live in UWS to really experience a great meal
the service was ok, a server did not know what he was doing but he was super kind so we were fine
the food we order was not better than what you can cook at home
first we order sea food appetizer, we order two of those but somehow they were different
taste, amount and kind of seafood
then the paste came in two rounds
first mine and my friend and second my wife and my other friend
beside the food the place is super noise, you can barely talk to the person next to you
Overall it is a good italian restaurant to go for only a drink at the bar
It is surprising that everytime I walk by the place is full
i do not understand
that tells me that people do no tknow about food as much as they say
It is with glee that i welcome this nice restaurant to the neighborood
Finally the so maligned (culinary wise) UWS is getting is fair share of good restaurants
Regional is as authentic Italian as it comes
The regional recipes are very tasty and moderately priced
On my second visit i tried the Salumi and the Cheeses and was so delicious
Good value for wine as well
Maybe service could be a little crispier, but the staff is very accomodating and willing to please
Worth a visit
Seldom in New York can one find a restaurant that is reasonably priced, beautifully decorated in a nice space, that actually serves good and interesting food
Regional is the new gem of the Upper West Side
Even though it's Italian, it's a very non-traditional menu, inventive menu
And to top it all that, I don't believe there's an dish on the menu that's over $20 (if there is, it's not by much and rare)
The desserts are wonderful
Get the cheese plate as an appetizer if it's available
Made on the spot, it has an assortment of cheeses with some apple puree dip, some kind of yoghurt, and pieces of a delectably sweet bread that partners perfectly with the cheese
The UWS restaurant is great
We arrived for a quiet dinner and had appetizers at the bar
The cheese and meat platter was amazing and made right in front of us
The meals were great and the atmosphere wonderful
The staff needs to relax a bit and enjoy themselves! We love it and will return often!
If all Italian restaurants were as good as this one , i'll probably trade my stove! I have been here a few times and never had a boring meal!Food always fresh, service very civilized
The recipes a bit atypical, but delicious(my favorite, whole wheat spaghetti in duck ragu')
Deserve a try
Finally a good , inexpensive, innovative and chic, but down to earth, italian restaurant
Real Italian
No Brooklyn accented recipes
Had the Fritto Misto,an assortment of fish and seafood( fried to perfection) followed by the special of the night Swordfish rollups, JUST LIKE SICILY
With a glass of crispy Vermentino the bill was under $30
How can you go wrong? One regret
should have tried the Apulian Lemon Ricotta Fritters, but my waste line
This new restaurant is truly an UWS gem! We are so pleased to have it in our neighborhood
The food is amazing! All of it, not just the great pastas, but the entrees are all great! We took a few friends from downtown and they just couldn't say enough of how wonderful the food was! The food is all fresh
We love trying a new dish everytime we go
This should not be missed
Any, the prices are also amazing!
Just back from dinner at this new restaurant for my first time,and i am shocked! you live in Nyc for many years and kind of get used to be taken for a ride when it comes to eating out
hyped up, mediocre restaurants, anashamedly overpriced
well, this is not the case! I found the menu very varied and different from most pasta joints where tomato reigns supreme
Had a mouthwatering sardinian Stuffed Squid and a Catfish fiumarola from Rome( think was capers and anchovies sauce)
What's this? Mario Batali tv show?A nice bottle of Pigato wine Liguria and Zuccotto, a gelato like dessert from Florence
What i most liked is that the place is comfortable and airy, modern in decor
Service was frendly and discreet
And then the prices
Not an entree over 17 dollars and good portions, too
Too good to be real
Good Luck to You,Regional
I will be back
We are very pleased with the addition of Regional to our neighborhood
We really like the food and the ambiance
It is a perfect excuse for not cooking at home
The pastas are very nice and so are the italian wines and the cheese or meat platters
The place is very busy since it opened in the spring of 2005
The atmosphere is casual and the staff is very helpful and friendly
While the menu seemed interesting and the design very nice, the food was earthshatteringly subpar
Ingredient quality bordered on comic (most vegitables came from cans, the Carpacio was likely 3 days old and inedible)
Service ranged from inattentive to annoying
What wasnt ruined by the ingredients and the service was ruined by the chef
Dont go
Ever
this restaurant is not worth at all!! the setting is really nice but the quantity of food is ridiculous
if you order a salad, you'll get two slices of tomato with some mozzarella
and it's not even good!!! don't go there!!!
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
There are so many restaurants in NYC where you can get better food service at a much better value
I don't mind paying $20+ for a plate, but the portion size was unbelievably small! My wife I ordered from the entree menu, but the portions were smaller than a child's appetizer
We left feeling so hungry, that we immediately went to another restaurant for a second meal
The service was less than spectacular (two waiters fought in front of us over which one got our table) and the bread put out as an appetizer was sub-par
The food was decent, not inedible, but also not redemptive
The price was what I expected to spend, but the sample-size servings left me incredulous
Don't waste your time, you'll have to eat again afterwards
this place is very cute but the service is bad
we ordered a bottle of wine from the bar while we waited for our table, when our table was ready we were sat and then waited 15 min for our server to ask us for a drink ,and when i asked for my wine she gave an attitude

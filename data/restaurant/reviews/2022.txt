I have been a devotee of the Magnolia Bakery Cupcakes since the bakery opened, long before Se* and the City made them more well known or was even on TV
In the beginning there were only cupcakes with Chocolate or Vanilla frosting
Later when the colored frostings were added I gave them a try and I found them too sugary and I agree with the person who said those frostings have a granular quality
If you stick with the classic chocolate or vanilla frostings you will not be disappointed, those icings are buttery creamy and delicious - they are the ones that keep me coming back and waiting on line when necessary
The ice box cake is also great, very fresh whipped cream and chocolate wafers - yum!
I've lived near Magnolia Bakery for nearly 10 years and I'm not entirely sure why people wait in line for the cupcakes
As far as cupcakes go there is nothing special about Magnolia's
Maybe it's the pretty pastel colors
I have picked up a few from time to time
usually when I've fogotten how poor my last experience
and I have consistently found the cupcakes to be terrible
The cake is dry and fairly tasteless
even though they seem to churn out a new batch ever 30 minutes or so
The frosting is far to dense and sweet
A good buttercream should not be gritty and Magnolia's is always gritty
A bit like eating sweetened sand suspended in butter
I really can't recommend these at all
I'm sure you could bake up a fresh batch of homemade cupcakes in the time it takes you to wait on that ridiculously long line
Okay, I have been to Magnolia Bakery several times in the hopes that it will live up to all the hype it gets, but I am always disappointed
The cupcakes look adorable, and I love the different colored frostings they use, but I think their cupcakes are really dry and the frosting is too sugary
I definitely can make better cupcakes at home!
I don't know what's up with the negative reviews here
I've been going to Magnolia for years now and have successfully converted everyone I've taken, from my parents to my wife to my second-grade students
The buttercream frosting is something like a magical potion of yumminess
The hipster staff are secretly taste wizards and flavor sorcerors, mixing and concocting their wonderful dessert spells all day and night
You may have to wait in line, and you may have to wait with some annoying people, but it will all be worthwhile after you take that first taste
Oh, man
I just made myself hungry
I gotta go
Was very disappointed last time I went
Cupcake was dry, but frosting was ok
not worth the lines and the crammed space
much prefer Buttercup bakery on the upper west side 72nd street
First and foremost the staff at Magnolia's are flat out rude and inconsiderate
I like Magnolia bakery but let's face it, there ARE other places to get great cupcakes as well as other bakery items
I have been going to Magnolia's for years and have seen a steady decline in quality and service which is typical of a place (and a small one at that) that gets popular thanks to a television show like Sex in the City
I did like that fact that they stagger how many people they allow into the store which is good
They didn't used to do this
Overall, I recommend to friends and family to not wait in line because the staff is unbearable when it's busy
It's better to go when there isn't anyone around, much better service and I wouldn't doubt, much better quality baked goods
the lines at this place are ridiculous, and depending on what you want, it's not worth the wait
i'm puzzled as to why many rave about the cupcakes -- my friends and i find them to be bland, dry, and crumbly
the ice box pie, on the other hand, is sublime
and the banana pudding with nilla wafers is pretty tasty too
so, choose wisely
magnolia cupcakes are amazing
i don't think they are the best, but they are very very good
chocolate cupcakes with vanilla frosting is the way too go
the frosting can be a bit sweet
banana bread pudding here is absolutely superb
coconut cake is also very good here
red velvet - did not care for it
carrot cake - very good
Wow! When you hold your first Magnolia Cupcake your mouth begins to water
We have now ordered over 200 cupcakes for parties and have never been disappointed
This is the best bakery in town
I owned a bakery in the south and have not tasted anything since, that came close to our recipes
If you are uptown, downtown, across town, around town and are in the mood for a little dessert I would run to Magnolia
Even the video Chronicles of Narnia that was featured on SNL did not do it justice
You must eat one to realize all of the things in life that you missed out on and will now take advantage
Treat yourself well, and eat a real cupcake
After hearing so much about the cupcakes, when finally tried them, I was a little disappointed
You can buy the Magnolia cookbook and they taste the same (or even a little better) than the expensive ones from the bakery
However, I also tried the carrot cake, and it was the greatest carrot cake I have ever eaten in my life
It was a little expensive, but it was a very generous slice
And it was delicious
The people that work there were very friendly and amusing, and there was no wait (but I also went at 6 on a wednesday and it was rainy)
But I still think about that carrot cake
I was pretty disappointed by the cupcakes
They're ok, but I've had better by the Cheesecake factory or the boxed kind my friend makes
However, their banana pudding was sooooo scrumptious
It's a cute little dive that is a cool experience
Go and sit at the nearby square and just chomp away
But seriously, the cupcakes are just ok and i'm a sweets addict
Yes, there is a long long line on the weekends, but go midweek and definitely try the coconut cake
They give you very generous slices
Cupcakes are always fresh so eat them at the park nearby
First time they were too sweet, but after a while you get addicted to them and it is always a true bakery experience to go their and grab a box
In NYC, waiting an estimated 20 minutes standing outside only to purchase an overcharged, overly sweet cupcake is insanely ridiculous
Thinking in the back of our heads, the Sex and the City stars relished in the orgasmic flavor so it must be good, right? Not necessary
HERE's the 411
the first time I had a cupcake from Magnolia, i was disappointed, the frosting was overly sweet and yes, absolutely disguisting, not worth 10 cents, let alone $1
75, however,i gave it a second chance, and they must have tweaked the recipe, because the frosting was toned down to edible and the cupcakes were incredibly fantastic
the cookies red velvet cake is worth every bite
So my advice, for all of you magnolia haters, just like i was, give it a second try now and if it's still horrible, buy your own box of Pillsbury for 1
75 and enjoy a batch
Waited in line for 20-30 minutes and was granted access by a very amusing, friendly 'bakery bouncer
' He lets approx
6-8 people in at a time for the initial scramble for access to the cupcakes but everyone settled in and got what they wanted
Selection is constantly rotating, but when we got there all varieties were plentiful
Maximum is a dozen cupcakes per person and theyre AMAZING! For me, the icing is what makes them
Sure its sugary and sweet, but were not exactly talking about a hot dog here! The cake was not dry and tasteless, I found it to be moist and the vanilla cupcake I had was delicious, the chocolate is a little more crumbly
Cashiers were very friendly - even traded jokes with me
Servers behind the counter were eager to help, overall my 2nd trip and my sisters 1st was a great one!
Most of these people are completely right
Line was long, service mostly rude, cupcake selection very small
AND the reason for coming - the actual cupcake - it was dry and tasteless and the icing was cloyingly sweet
Kitchenette is better
And that place across from Essex Market
And 2 or 3 places in Chelsea Market

Not your ussual rushed pre-theater experience
And Icompletely agree with the previous reviewer, the tiramisu is sinfully good
My friend took me here on a Friday night
We had a whole bunch, it was 8 of us
We had a blast
The food was fantastic
I had the meat tortellini with prosciutto and peas in a delicious creamy sauce
My freinds had the pizza with 4 cheeses, it was fabulous
Everyone was happy with the food
The service was fast and attentive
We ordered bottles of wine, very good at the waiter's suggestion
Finally, the ambience was so nice
The decor is breathtakingly beautiful downstrais in the garden, where we were sitting
We had a great time
We already made reservation for another dinner here in a couple of weeks, we are going to the theater
Oh, I almost forgot, the tiramisu, my God, you have to try it
Amazing!
From the moment I tasted the open lobster ravioli I was hooked!! It was soooo tasty! Haven't found better ravioli anywhere else in NYC
You have to give it a try ! Don't let the theater district stigma fool you, the food is far better than many pricey establishments downtown or uptown
The canalini with tuna is so delectable! Chicken with porcini mushrooms is an explosion of flavor, many great pasta dishes too
I have tried many things from the menu and have never been disappointed, everything is always delicious ! Try the homemade taramisu
And it won't put a dent in your wallet
I actually met my friend from highschool recently in a lounge around midtown
He invated me here with my wife for dinner before theater
My wife and I go to the theater a lot, so we are sceptical about the pre-theater dinner
Ussually, it's not that good and they rush you out
We most often eat downtown, hop on a train and go to the show
My friend insisted on comming here and he was absolutelly right
Dopo Teatro is a beautiful space, especially downstrais
Spacious with a great, fast service
We had a bottle of great wine
My wife great ravioli with veal
I had great ossobuco
Amazing
The service was spectacular, they didn't rush us, the wine recommendation was right what we were looking for, and we walked 2 blocks to the theater! It was enough to change our pre theater routine; we will be back for sure!
I work in the area and love this place
I have dinner here quite often
Their pizza is great
I love the linguine with clams, pine nuts, garlic and tomatoes
They have great homemade tiramisu! Great for lunch too, if you can find the time to get away
Make reservation, they tend to get busy
I highly recommend it
I have come to Dopo for many years now
My wife and I love the place
Recently we ventured out to the theater and had dinner there
They have had consistently good food and service over the years, but the specials have gotten more unique and delicious
I had roasted pork shoulder with Tuscan herbs
Home made roast, that's nice in a restaurant
My wife had ricotta and spinich gnocchi in butterand sage sauce, again not your usual
She liked it very much, but said it was a little heavy, but highly recommends it, if you like butter and sage
The service was excellent as always
Mario, the manager is very cordual
It's a great place in that location
We recommend it
I bring most of my business lunch clients here
The food is always good
The service is always proffesional and attentive
The specials are great and interesting
The have nice space, so it makes nice atmosphere for conducting business
They have great salads and great pizzas
My husband took me here for our aniversary dinner
It is a beautiful space, high ceillings, elegant and yet vivacious decor - very inviting
The food was delicious
I had gnocchi with seafood
My husband had veal, which was excellent
They have a great wine collection, they even had a bottle from the year my husband and I got married, more than 20yrs ago
It was truely an enchanting evenning
The restaurant staff made it flawless
Thank you
My boyfriend took me to this charming restaurant
The secret garden was so romantic
We were seated on a little balcony, he arranged everything
The wine was delicious
The food was great as well
I had the striped bass in garlic sauce, it was really good
The fish was tender and tasty served with vegetables
very light to leave room for desert
They have home made deserts
What a wonderful night
It's nice when a place this romantic and beautiful also has great food and good service
I highly recommend it
I know this restaurant for many years
I remember when it was much smaller, just the dining room ustrais
That was when my daughter was a todler, we used to bring her here
Now she is 16 years old and loves the theater
I bring her to the city often, and whenever we come to see a play we go eat to Dopo
That's our little tradition
She adors their Dopo Teatro Pizza with prociutto and trufil oil
I usually go for the veal
The pastas are great too
I highly recommend the food and the way they treat you, very nice
I work in the area and I love going to lunch there
They are friendly, the service is fast and the food is delicious
My favorites are the open lobster ravioli, gnocchis and the pizzas
All their pasta is freshly made on the premesis
The also have a brick over, where the pizzas come out of
With the fast and friendly service and terrific food, it's a great lunch place
We just held a copmpany luncheon there and everyone was happy
I took my mom here before going to see a play on Broadway
Right away, when you walk in the ambience of this restaurant puts you in a better mood; it's realy pretty and calm

Jackson Hole)  But, if you want a unique burger experience check out Island Burgers and Shakes
Taste in burgers, of course, is very subjective
But for me, IBS didn't do it
I agree with the writers below who said the burgers are too dry
Additionally, they lack flavor
I think the reason for both of these failings is that they use too-lean meat; fat adds moisture and flavor
Also, heed the warning of another writer: Don't order your burger with sourdough or rye bread--they fall apart
Certainly there is a huge variety of toppings
I would go back to IBS to try the chicken sandwich, but the burger, in my mind, is sub-par
totally overrated! the burgers were dry and not cooked as we ordered
ok, they have variety, but it would be nice to have a good burger to start with
The burgers here are good by a home-cooking standard, but they are hardly restaurant quality
But, the food comes in good-sized portions, the wait staff is nice and you can't beat the price with a stick
The price makes this place worth the trip
Tip: they do tend to overcook, so adjust your order accordingly
I ordered medium and got well, which is what I wanted
Meet a friend there for lunch
Order my burger medium
Waiter stated that it would be pink in the middle
I said fine
Burger came well done
Expected a better tasting burger
It was decent, a bit on the dry side
I liked the eclectic pastel decor
Place could pass as a sushi restaurant
No fries, just baked potatoes
A cheap-eat for NYC but for a $7
50 burger you get what you pay for
The worse burger I have ever tried
The burger was small and dry
Burger King or McDonalds have far much better burgers
I'm not a native New Yorker, coming to these shores from the UK and Island Burgers and Shakes always makes NY for me
Simply the best burgers anywhere on earth, with anything you like on them at a dirt cheap price - and the yummy milkshakes are more dessert than drink
Go, go now, I urge you!!
This little hole-in-the wall you might miss if you blink walking past it! One line of small tables along a very narrow establishment, probably only 10-12 tables in all
Waitstaff attentive
LOTS of burgers to choose from
It was made just as ordered, but was a bit dry
But tasted great! Not large in diameter, but so high could hard get my mouth around it! Don't order a burger on rye
the bread is too dry and will fall apart
The shakes are nothing special
Not as thick as the ones we have in Wisconsin
My son did like the Black and White shake though
This place has one of the best burgers I've ever eaten! One word of warning: the sourdough can be a little tricky to eat, so I've been substituting a basic onion roll
Take your friends, even if they're not a fan of red meat -- all of the choices can be made with a breast of chicken instead
But not better than Jackson Hole
IBS is a real nice little place where you can get some interesting toppings
The burgers are dry and not cooked as ordered
The Chicken sandwiches are almost better than the burgers
The space is small, but cozy
This is another place which has earned a cult like following which I cannot comprehend
The shakes are good, but an afterthought
IBS beats the hell out of the ridiculously rated Bistro Burger, but not having fries is a hassle(not a cute quirk)
This place makes me feel like I am in San Francisco
I can count on mayo, catsup, lettuce and avocado with my burger and the vanilla milkshakes are the stuff of cravings
It is a comfortable place to eat alone
the staff is attentive and the crowd youngish
A little bit of Santa Cruz in Hells Kitchen
Great burgers and HUUUGE salads
No they don't have fries
and thats ok!
Was happy with this little hole-in-the-wall
Food was good, can't beat the prices
Lots of choices
Milkshakes are thick and yummy
Has an early 1960's surfer/beach movie flavor
Perfect for going out with some friends
This is heaven
The only criticism of Island Burger too many choices
All the choices can make for a long evening
Trying to decide, which scrumptious burger to eat can be a exhausting, but fear not all your energyy is restored with one bite of these magnificant meat patties
Whether its the Cowboy or Hippo or Saratoga you will be treated to a taste of heaven
staying away from Island Burger??? I wouldn't think of it!
The food here was good for the money
Compared to places like Jackson Hole where the burgers have no flavor or imagination, this place does better
The service is a different story
Don't expect prompt service or even friendly service
At times I had to look at my own hands to see if I was invisible
I also found it interesting to take the mustard bottle off my table to replace it with an empty bottle 10 minutes later
The food is good,service and decor bad
I would advise if you live in the city to just get it delivered or take it out
Can't believe I missed this place
Went last night, based on your reviews--this is the best!
Burger is just the right size, done right and juicy
Best would be the wide choices of toppings, sides and bread type
But the place is rather small, they deliver though
It's really just a mediocre burger
Infact, it was very undercooked and I had to send it back for a few more minutes on the grill
The decor is lame and service not so hot
And the we-don't-serve-french-fries thing is a whole lot of nothing
This is how burgers should be done
Fat, juicy, and delicious
Great variety of toppings
The regular bun is supermarket variety so go for ciabatta or sourdough
Good milkshakes
Kitschy 50's surfer-theme decor
I've heard the churasco's (grilled chicken breast sandwich) are good but I inevitably choose beef everytime
EXCELLENT and SIMPLE menu, the only con is that it's BYOF - Bring your own fries

We've always wanted to go here
Reservations a must at dinner (we had lunch there and made them that day)
Wonderful service from young man named Micah
Lunch began with great bread and olive oil
I don't like beets but enjoyed their's
Waiter suggested a very nice wine to a companion who is a wine nut -- but not extensively versed on Italian wines -- that we all were impressed by
The food was splendid
This meal made up for a bad experience we had all just had at the clearly over-praised restaurant THE TASTING ROOM
Thank-you LUPA for ending our friends visit to New York on a high note!
They call this the poor man's Babbo
well, I'm fine with being poor then
Very reasonably priced top notch Italian basically sums this place up
The spaghettini with spicy cauliflower ragu I still dream about
The house made lamb sausage was flat out the best sausage I have ever eaten anywhere anytime
Great food
Our first trip to Lupa was great
However, we had a reseravation several weeks in advance and still got seated in the front room
Was very noisy
Other than that- the food was wonderful and the service was great
Our favorite meal in NYC during a one week stay
We will be back for sure
One of my favorite restaurants in the city but the wait is always a killer
I've had really good meals there and not so good at times, but overall good
After watching Mario Batali's cooking shows on TV, I was intrigued by his restaurants
The buccatini pasta dish was fantastic as was the pork shins which actually tasted like roses
The saltimboca was just too salty
My friend and I went once, got 2 appetizers, one pasta dish and two main entrees and a little wine, $75 with tax and tip
We were a party of 4, but one of our party was running late
Was told they would not seat us until party was complete
Told them we would order wine and appetizers, but still wouldn't let us sit - it was a party of 3 or they would give our table away
We sat down
We were rushed and I mean RUSHED
The plates were pulled away before we finished each course
IF I WANT FAST FOOD, I'LL EAT AT MCDONALD'S
The Maitre'd actually talked about us to customers who were arriving
We were treated horribly
The maitre'd actually told us that he was there to make money
I WOULD NEVER GO BACK AND I WILL MAKE IT A POINT NOT RECOMMEND ANOTHER BATALI RESTAURANT
SORRY - THERE'S TOO MANY GOOD RESTAURANTS IN NYC TO BOTHER WITH THE ATTITUDE
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
this is where i go to eat real italian food
whenever i have guests from out of town, i bring them here for saturday lunch
at nights it gets pretty busy
lunch is your best bet if you don't have reservations
their gnocchi is fantastic
great italian wines
not a cheap restaurant, but worth every dollar
a great place for dates and a couple of good friends
casual and comfortable
I think Lupa is one of the best restaurants in the city! The food is consistantly wonderful
Avoid the wait, and make a reservation! The staff is always kind and helpful, the vegetable starters are always good (but best in summer!) and the pastas are what I crave when I want pasta
Every time I go, I know it is going to be a great experience!
The food at Lupa is definitely delicious! But, everything was way salty
In fact, the women at a table that was too close to us (hint hint) sent their entrees back, because of how salty they were
Authentic Northern Italian fare though!
The experience is great and a value for the authetic Italian food and celeb chef Mario Batalli is involved! The room is cozier but noisier the further you go into the restaurant
The service is great and the waiters give nice wine/ food recommendations that will not break the bank
Had a great $30 bottle of red and it was complementary and smooth
Had the fried pork shin, which is a-m-a-z-i-n-g, not for the faint of heart but so yummy especially if you like meats covered with sweetness, in this case honey and roses
mmm
The food was excellent at a recent brunch
The salmon was superb
BUT
a request for an accomodation to serve dressing on the side or even the salad without dressing due to a dietary restriction resulted in a REFUSAL
The chef it seems, is so impressed with his own needs to be a prima-dona that he will not budge to dietary restrictions -- or has so terrorized the staff that they won't even ask
I rarely encounter this intransigence even in the finest restaurants in NY, Paris or London
Be aware that the dining room is drafty and cold on a recent day and the bathrooms are apparently unheated with drafty windows
So, a warm sweater and scarf would have helped the moderate uncomfort
And two women companions said that the bathroom was nearly unbearable
This was my time dining at a Mario Batali restaurant and it did not disappoint at all
Some of the absolute best, most innovative Italian food in the city
Especially enjoyed the cauliflower pasta
Prices were relatively reasonable for the wonderful experience, exceptional service, and ambiance
I can't wait to go again
A very long wait and frustrating without a reservation
However, once seated all was forgiven
The food and service was outstanding
Simple fair with fantastic flavors
After hearing many rave reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Lupa last night
I really didn't mind waiting the hour for the table
In anticipation of astounding food, we ordered appitizers, first plates, second plates, and even sides
We were VERY disappointed
The food was OK
It wasn't terrible, but I didn't like it either
It certainly wasn't anything to rave about
I know from now I'll spread the word that Lupa is not a place to go for excellent cuisine
This little, cozy restaurant opened my eyes to the hidden flavors of Italian cuisine
Although I've had lots of Italian food, eaten in a lot of Italian restaurants, and travelled to Italy several times, the flavors that came though in this food were so vivid I couldn't believe it
It's the best Italian I've ever had
It was a very busy night but we slipped in, were seated immedaitely, waited on fast and efficiently by a waitress who knew all about the food
Unfortunately, we were asked to hurry up so the next party could sit down which sort of lessened the experience
The food is great but the portions are VERY SMALL you can hardly see them in your plate! we all left hungry
WE ARRIVED AT 6:30PM AND WERE SEATED PROMPTLY, WITHOUT A RESERVATION
(ON A WEDNESDAY)
THE WAITER WAS CLUELESS
SEATING WAS TIGHT IN THE BACK ROOM
I HAD A PASTA SPECIAL FOR APPETIZER WHICH WAS HARDY
DISSAPOINTED WITH THE VEAL SALTIMBOCA
IT WAS A LITTLE SALTY, FLATTENED TOGETHER, DRY AND BROILED A LITTLE TOO LONG
NOT TERRIBLE OVERALL FOR A WEEK NIGHT DATE

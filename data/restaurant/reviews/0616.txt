The pizzas are averae and paper thin, so you'll need to order at least two of them if you don't want to walk away hungry
Advice: if you want good pizza, go to Patsy's
Sorry Mario
Love your show, love Po and Lupa
but Otto was a crushing disappointment
We went in at an off-time and waited for only 20 minutes
[Note to reader: only go at an off-time and it will offset your disappointment later
] Then we got sat at a table with others
If I want to dine with others, I'd go out with more friends
Then the pizza
I tried the four cheese and it was ok
But whoever dressed it only got cheese on half the slices
(!) And it cost $14 - for a pizza I could have folded in half twice and still been more hungry than had I eaten a slice at Ray's
Bottom line, it's not bad pizza
It's just not very good pizza
ALl of the reviews I have read on Otto are so terribly critical
This is NYC guys! Where can you go to a great restaurant owned by a fabulous chef and see him at the counter assisting? Where can you have a fun atmosphere, great pizza, and a waitstaff that cares about how you are enjoying your meal
I have been to Otto twice since it opened
I thought the pizza was wonderful, the waitstaff extremely friendly and the wait was a little long, but what do you expect
get there early and stop complaining!  Otto is fabulous for what it is - a gourmet pizzeria
I am a tough critic and I am Italian
I loved it
Cheers to Mario
Another great success!
My friend took me there for my birthday; objectively speaking, it was avg
food for fancy prices; menu consisted of one page; antipasto, and pizza; that was pretty much it; the other 3 pages was to my surprize the wine list
It was alright to try, but I wont be going back
We were there at 7:00 and did not leave till 12:30
We waited for almost 2 hours for a seat then had to sit at a community table, the pizza was not worth the waite or any waite for that matter
I expected much more from mario batali
His other places are much better
The only good thing about this place is the bar
I have never, ever been to a restaurant in NYC where I was rushed some much by the waitstaff even told to 'bite me' by our waitperson
It happened at Otto on a Saturday early evening dinner I had with my sister and her b-friend who came in from nj, expecting a great experience
I was appalled at the level of arrogance of our waitperson, I would have expected better from a Mario restaurant
This type of service pretty much ruined a good meal/time for our group
I still cannot believe the lack of professionalism displayed towards our group
Thank god the food was good, (not great), but good
I will go back, and hopefully managment will have cleaned out the riff-raff from the waitstaff
After reading many reviews, I was excited to try Otto
We walked right in on a Sunday night and did not have to wait
Our waitress was pushy, arrogant and ignorant
The caprese salad was great
Best mozzerella I have ever had
The gelato was great too (hazelnut!) On the other hand I have never had SUCH BAD PIZZA in my life
It is an insult to pizza
The tomato sauce taked like a mix of tomato paste and canned tomato sauce (the metal can kind)
I would only return for drinks and dessert
I love the NY restaurant scene, the critics and pundits love to build someone up and then knowck them down
Mario Battali's Otto doesn't promise to be Alain Ducasse so give it a break
The pizza is very good and comparable to pizza found in common Trattorias throughout Italy
Sure it isn't like eating in Milano but then again NY water doens't emanate from the Po Valley
Therefore the pizza will never be perfect
I like to go there on weekend afternoons for a late lunch and recommend it to everyone
Don't believe the (negative) hype
went twice since it is in the neighborhood, both times very ok
the wait is looong and when my table was called after two hours (and 3 glasses of wine), i cheered like i had won the lottery, as did others, patting our backs as we walked by
ordered a few apps
(so salty) and two pizzas
my friend sent back his pizza because it was truly not right, ordered another and they charged us for both! anyway, if you are dying to try it
go after a day of shopping
stop in for lunch
but DO NOT MISORDER or YOU WILL BE CHARGED
This place is way over-rated
There is much better pizza in the city than at Otto
I can't believe people would actually wait 2 hours to eat here
loved the caprese salad and had great service- a new favorite
Being a huge fan of Mario Batali's cooking and loving pizza, I was excited to learn that the much awaited Otto Enoteca had opened its doors to the public
Too bad it sucked! Although we had a three hour wait to be seated, we hung out at the bar, enjoyed some cocktails and had some good munchies
The bar is cool and the service was decent
When we finally made it to our table, we ordered some appetizers which were fine
When my napoletan pizza finally came out, I was shocked, dumbfounded
Could this really be pizza? It tasted like pita bread, slapped with prego tomato sauce and four anchovies thrown ontop
It was practically inedible
I thought I was coming here for a truly authentic italian pizza experience- was I at the right restaurant? I can depend on better pizza at even Domino's
Has Mario even tasted the pizza?
pizza on the grill is an insult to Italy and they have the most ignorant waitstaff i ever seen
So I'm usually a huge fan of Batali's - Lupa, Babbo, Esca
even his Food Network shows
but this time I was very disappointed
It isn't that the food or the service is bad in any way it is just that we (I) have come to expect so much more from Batali
and this time he didn't live up to it
Boring starters
the pizza is honestly tastier at a few pizza corner stores! Didn't taste bad just not great! Great selection of wines but I would have expected a few more cheaper affordable wines by the glass!
I was really excited about this restaurant
We went opening weekend and got a table without waiting because we showed up around 5:30
The menu was completely baffling
I started asking questions but soon realized that I would need the waitress to translate and explain the entire menu
I gave up and went with her recommendations
The appetizers were great and I was psyched that the pizza was going to blow me away
It didn't
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything I couldn't get better somewhere else
Bland, unfilling, and cold
Go to Don Giovanni instead
Or any of Mario's other restaurants
Went there for the first time last night
Waited for an hour, but it was well worth it
Amazing atmosphere
The wine selection was great and everyone loved the pizza
I know I'll be back!!!!!!!!!

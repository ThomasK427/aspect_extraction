My companion and I were very full at the end of the meal
Some may say of course we were at that price, but I've eaten MUCH more expensive dinners that offered MUCH less food
*cough* *wd~50* *cough*  Besides everything else, the food at Blue Hill is superb
And that's the only important thing in my book
We had a great table and accommodating waiter
Everything was good but nothing really grabs you, servings on the slightly small side and muted flavors
Cool room tho
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing! The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
Beautiful experience
I went a couple weeks ago with a dinner group
We each tried something different
The appetizers were good, I was told the crab salad was very refreshing
For an entree, their grass fed lamb almost melts in your mouth
As dessert I would highly recommend the steamed cheesecake
I'm not crazy about cheesecake but this was, hands-down, the best cheesecake I have ever had
It was topped with berries that weren't too sweet and weren't very tart
If you're a cheese fan, the cheese plate is also very good
As a group of five, we were treated very well by the bartender, Sean, and our waitress was also very attentive
The atmosphere is better for small groups (less than 5) or a romantic evening
Portions are miniature at this very pretty restaurant
Ambiance is nice, but don't come hungry
Pizza place down the street will fill you up afterwards
This restaurant took our group by surprise
Each of us eats out many times during the week with weekends left for recreating the best of in our own kitchens
Tonight we found out why Joan Hamburg and Arthur Schwartz have mentioned this wonderful restaurant
Much of the food comes directly from their farm near Tarrytown (supplemented of course by the Greenmarket)
The ingredients could stand alone, but the chef prepares them with such thoughtfulness and novelty that a memorable meal results
The waitstaff is charming and attentive, while the interiors are handsome and calm
We will definitely return to Blue Hill with many more clients to help the slight financial sting of adoring this restaurant
In reality, the whole experience is well worth the price, fact is so many higher priced restaurants deliver only 1/4 the satisfaction of what Blue Hill does on an average
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening
At 6:30, we were the third party there
ordered the tasting menu
2
5 hours and 9 dishes later (three desserts!) we were stuffed and happy
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full
But I'd go back
The food is superb here and the service is wonderful
I have always had wonderful meals here and it always pleases and impresses everyone
This is a true gem and I am thrilled that I live close by!
My wife I went here after getting a recommendation from a friend
We were both very pleased with our meals and the service was excellent
We'd recommend it to others
The service was great and the food very well prepared although, many of the food combinations were not interesting to me (look over the menu online before you go)
My main problem was the portions were minuscule
It was an expensive night and I was still hungry after dinner
The entree consisted of 3 small strips of hanger steak on a bed of romaine w/ a few fingerling potatoes
The horseradish broth it sat in was terrific but I wanted more
Prior to dinner I had a scotch, they only have 3 to choose from and the one they recommended was $18? The wine was great and they kept bringing us bread, these were the two best things about the meal
It was an older crowd at 40 years old I felt very young that night
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress
Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis
Bravo, Blue Hill!
I brought my vegetarian girlfriend here to celebrate our 1-year together
I called in advance to ensure that they could accomodate vegetarians
This helped, as our gracious server knew ahead of time that my girlfriend's needs pointed out that while the menu appeared to have no vegetarian entrees, the chef would prepare a meal for her, no problem
We both ordered the $65 5-course tasting menu, and the chef designed a tasting menu of several vegetarian dishes that pleased my girlfriend
Our food was tasty, and some of the dishes had interesting pairings, such as butternut squash cheesecake with cumin and passion fruit gelee with coffee and coconut froth
The combo of our nice server, delectable food ambiance left me dazzled
I highly recommend Blue Hill- it's on par with Gramercy Tavern Craft for best American Creative food- would go back in a heartbeat
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend
The decor is very simple but comfortable
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth
I loved it and would go again
I had dinner recently at Blue Hill and was totally impressed with the whole experience
The restaurant is nicely laid out, nothing ground-breaking, just an elegant space
But the food! The portions were fairly small, standard pricy-restaurant size dishes
However, each meal was delicious, very fresh with well balanced flavors and textures
We had the dessert tasting menu, which was quite a gastronomic experience! Avocado with lime sorbet, topped with some sort of salted caramel chip
Who eats avocado for dessert?! To sum up: The food was beautifully prepared and delicious, the service was attentive and gracious, and the overall experience was delightful
Very romantic
Wait staff is unobtrusive, generous, and careful to make the experience a good one
Food is very good, but the menu doesn't change as often as it should, given the creativity
Highly recommend it for first or second dates
We were served much too quickly
We had to return both entrees
One (the cod) was undercooked and the other (rib steak special) was overcooked (delivered medium when ordered rare)
The appetizers were tasty but not exceptional
First time we ordered Chivas scotch in a restaurant with a full bar and they did not have Chivas
All in all, disappointing
to see the incredibly small portions on my plate
I paid too much and got too little -- which is not acceptable in this economy
I got the $26 (or was it $28) hangar steak, and it weighed perhaps 6-8 oz
I will admit that the steak was very well prepared
I thought the mushroom appetizer was lovely
The wine list is on the pricey side
Overall, I don't know what all the fuss is about -- you can get food that is as well (if not better) prepared at numerous places in the neighborhood, and at most places you will actually walk out with a full stomach
We just ate at this restaurant last night and loved it
Our meals - fall mushrooms and the cod; crab lasagna and the lamb - were creative and delicious
The service couldn't have been better; our waitress was friendly and informed, and her timing was perfect
The atmosphere was cozy and intimate
Highly recommend Blue Hill for a quiet evening with good company!

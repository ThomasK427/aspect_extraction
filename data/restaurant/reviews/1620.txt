This neighborhood favorite had gone largely unnoticed outside the neighborhood
Maybe that's a good thing for us locals
4 stars for food--not in relation to a high end restaurant, of course, but for being consistently YUMMY
Versatile and reliable--there should be something on the menu to satisfy anybody
Easy on the wallet

In Short Dok Suni means "strong woman" in Korean, which is fitting since this lady has lasted more than a decade
Old Korean newspapers decorate the walls, while thumping music and Asian-inspired cocktails please the stylishly edgy crowd
The menu is broad, with appetizers like sticky rice cakes in spicy red pepper and garlic sauce, and entrees ranging from light potato noodles with vegetables in sesame sauce to hearty white bean stew with miso, tofu, zucchini and mushroom
The food in this restaurant tastes good but they do not give you as much as you would get in Koreatown
My favorites are the tofu in the mixed appetizer that they give and the kalbi and bulgogi dishes
Service is pretty efficient
All in all a good place to eat especially on a weekday evening when it is not too crowded
Dok Suni is a slightly funky Korean restaurant that's a little different in that they play with traditional dishes, in a good way, and the service is pretty good
I wouldn't say it is authentic but still very enjoyable on the whole
Everything I've had is delicious- they just know how to get all the spices right at this place- I especially ejoy the Bulgogi, Kimchi Pancake and Tender chicken
They also serve a side of pickled vegetables and tofu with each meal-out of this world! A fun place to experience with friends, the complimentary shot of cinnamon tea at the end of the meal is a nice touch
Went in December '05 with a friend
Pros: Location and Price
Cons: Food average
Service ok
Ambience nothing special, just regular neighborhood place
Overall: Dok Suni has received great reviews elsewhere, but honestly, don't waste your time
I know Korean food and if that's what you want to eat, just go to Korea Town, for crying out loud!
The food here is good; however, it could be a bit more spicier
I took my Korean mother here because it was recommended by a friend
My mother complained through the whole meal because she said the food looked like leftovers and scraps
It's trendy, sure, but you'd be better off going to a Koreatown place if you really want good Korean food
Went here last night on a recommendation from my fiancee's boss
We were not disappointed
The service was great once we ordered, and the food was fabulous
We had: sticky ricve appetizer, it was nice and spicy, exactly what i wanted; spring roll; jalapeno chicken; and dok suni gui, which had slices of garlic in it which suited my taste perfectly
Would definitely recommend, We will be back!
Jalapeno chicken is beyond delicious
I am a regular at DoK Suni and recommend this place if you love Korean food
A bit busy some nights, but worth the wait
Decor does not compliment the food
Stephanie, our waitress, RULES! We love this place
The food is inventive and delicious
The wine
great values
The atmosphere is sexy and romantic - a great place to take outtatowners to show them a REAL New York experience - it's small, hip and GOOD
We love this place
Don't tell your friends! ;)
I just love this place
The people that work there are friendly, the food is awesome and the orange saketini's, well lets just say they are very good
If you are trying this place for the first time and like your food spicy - try the sticky rice appetizer
Delicious! Oh and the place is a little small and usually gets crowded by 7:30pm so go early if you want to be seated right away
I went here on a date during the week and waited for a mere ten minutes
The staff was very friendly and the service was quick
The place is small, so I can see why people would have to wait for a long time on busy nights
It gets crowded even on slower nights! The bulgogi and bebimbop are yummy! I am not familiar with Korean food but the waitresses were patient and helpful with the menu, asking me what kind of food I liked and stuff like that
Check out the drink list! I think some of the bad reviews scared me away before, but some people just need to be a little nicer when they eat out
I had a great experience here and this is my new favorite date night spot!
If you are new to Korean, this is where you should start
Perfectly and adventurously spiced, though a bit overpriced ($16 for bulgoki-a teriyaki-like beef dish), Dok Suni does it right
Skip appetizers and go right for the WonBok Kimchee soup, and one of the main entrees, which is often enough to share
The biggest drawbacks are long waits and music that is NOT conducive to digestion
Want to try Korean food but too timid to venture onto Korea Way (32nd Street)? Dok Suni's menu will give you a general but good idea of what to expect at a typical restaurant
Even though entrees are neatly described in plain english, the staff will be happy to answer any questions you may have
Dining with company familiar with the cuisine can help to explain things like bonchon (small pre meal dishes), but it's not absolutely necessary
For you hardcore Korean food lovers, the taste is slightly Americanized, so be warned and leave your complaints at the door
Unlike many places in NY, the hostess tells you the longest possible wait time
I've been there 5+ times and never waited as long as what she's said it could be
Don't know why others are writing bad reviews of a place they went to years ago either
Food is good, if Americanized Korean
Some may be right there is better stuff in Flushing, but that would involve going to Flushing
Great taste and great value here
Dok Suni, it's great if you want average Korean food in the chic East village setting
The food doesn't match w/ either Korean towns in queens or the west 30's
P
S
the recipies in the Dok Suni cook cookbook doesn't work out and rarely tastes like the restaurants
moreover, the ingredient lists are incomplete
Despite the long wait, the food is delicious and well worth the wait
Drinks are really good too
I've been to Dok Suni's numerous times over the years and my experience has been consistently good
The Wait Never more than 20 minutes, you can wait at the bar (friendly bartenders, decent drinks)  Dcor - The tables are close together, but that's hardly a unique situation in a NYC restaurant most of the diners make a point of keeping their voices low
Its softly lit without being dark (You can see your food clearly!) Its a small restaurant and I wouldnt recommend a party larger than four people
Food Ive had Korean friends point out that the food is a bit Americanized, but I still enjoy it
I enjoy all the seafood selections (the monkfish and the spinach/clam soup are excellent)
Im told that their beef selections are also good
Dok Suni's is consistently delicious
If you must compare it to other Korean restaurants, it certainly kicks ass over the Korean places I've tried in midtown
But I'm not hung up on authenticity per se
I appreciate GOOD food, cozy ambience and friendly wait staff, all of which Dok Suni's has plenty of
I do wish it were a little less expensive
But I still eat there once a week on average, and I'm never disappointed with the food or service
Please ignore many of the other reviewers that have posted for Dok Suni's (they're probably from uptown)

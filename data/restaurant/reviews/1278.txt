The food was great, and I really liked the way they described the menu, and the family style kind of dining
I definately reccommend this place, and go now before you have to wait months for a reservation
After making reservations almost a month in advance, I was very disappointed to be seated in a secluded area for dinner next to the sushi bar and KITCHEN!!!!!!! - it was too far from the ambience of the entire restaurant - and the place was not even full from the time we arrived until we left
It's a beautiful place - let everyone enjoy it
Everything here is pretty good, some things are excellent
The rare miss--as some noted, chow fun can be overly soft and/or greasy
Spare ribs are okay but nothing special
Almost everythign else we've had has been really good and all is really cheap
The setting is nothing special, nor is the service but if you want some Asian small plates in a bar-type setting, go for it
Chino's has become my new regular Lunch spot after trying their awesome pork sandwhich and calamari salad
I've also had their Chow fun's which despite being a bit oily, are so delicious
The Lunch box deal where you can pick two for $10 including rice and an ice tea is one of the best luches in the area
Service was quick and friendly, and the decor is cozy and interesting
I have to give Chinos props for a great decor (cozy, interesting), good service, and an inventive menu
but I have to say my friend and I were highly disappointed with the food we ordered
Spareribs were good, but the Chow Fun was anything but, along with the Kim Chee fried rice
It seems like if you stay away from noodle/rice dishes, you should be safe
The chow fun was served in some sort of red broth, which made it soupy and the noodles soggy
On top of that it was particularly bland -- same for kim chee fried rice
I love Chino's! It's my favorite kind of place--small, intimate, cool well-thought out decor, really great food--but with no snotty attitude
Instead, attentive friendly service which creates such a warm vibe to the place
The roast pork bao bun is so fantastic, served with a hot mustard that balances the sweet pork without overwhelming it
Crackling calamari salad--fried calamari tossed with frisee greens--really yummy
A side of sticky rice and a ginger iced tea--all for 9
95 at lunch
A real bargain for such amazing food
Each bite a delight!
One Saturday night my boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to dine in the neighborhood
We discovered Chino's and it was a perfect start to a great night
The food was delicious
The service was great
My boyfriend had one of their sangria's which was unique and tasty
Overall we had a fantastic experience, all for a very reasonable price! We will definitely return!!
Last night, my sister decides to treat me for a belated birthday dinner, that I suggested this place
On the menu board posted outside - they got Passion Fruit Creme Brule
That's good enough for me as we settled in the cozy and dark wood interior filled with mod Asian touches
Most of the items fell below $10
We had the crispy tofu and seared tuna rolls for appies, divine yum! Entrees consisted of Roasted Spareribs (falls off the bone goodness!) and a bowl of Chow Fun with Shrimp (I detected Kimchee on the sauce - super spicy hot!)
Spicy Lobster Fried Rice was not spicy - just scrumptious
And to die for Creme Brule saved my burning tastebuds
All in all, a pleasant place with affordable prices and a moody ambiance as well
The Asian Tapas theme sounded good to me, but I didn't expect it to be so good that I would return the next three nights in a row! I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly, the service prompt, and the prices fair
At this time I wouldn't be able to choose my favorite dish because every time I try something new, it becomes my new favorite! The mood inside is quite calming (especially when sipping one of their Asian tea choices with dessert)
A true compliment to authentic Asian cuisine
This is my first review ( I was compelled to write it!)
The Lady Friend and I went here on a Friday night in mid-April
As expected, it was crowded but their system of suggesting to go the Dead Poet next door works well
They take your number and call you when a table opens up
As for the restaurant itself, the L(B)F and I had a good time there
The food was good, the decor was simple and the lighting was muted enough that my scars didn't show but bright enough that I could see that the L(B)F chewed with her mouth closed
It's definitely a good date place as it has great atmosphere without appearing that you're trying too hard
Land used to be a tiny gem of a place with assertively spiced Thai food and a long wait
The staff would take your cell phone and direct you next door to the Dead Poet, which is a tiny gem of a bar
Unfortunately, success seems to have gone to its head
Not only is the food not as consistent as it used to be (the spring rolls, for example, were soggy and rather bland on my last visit), the wait has become entirely unreasonable
45 minute waits regularly drag on much, much longer, and the staff seems to be entirely incapable of managing the crowds
With other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood which are also inexpensive and delicious, there's no need to put up with attitude and rudeness
Great Place, Great Service, Excellent Prices
I could not believe that this place was right around the corner! So good, great for lunch
Highly recommend it!
Title says it all really
This tiny gem can't be faulted
Their $7 lunch special would still be good value at twice the price
I can't believe I found Thai food as good as in Thailand just one block from my apartment
good decoration good taste good food I went there with my boyfriend last night
It was good memory
Don't think it is the best Thai food I have ever tasted but def the best on the UWS
Staff is excellent and so is food and the prices are perfect
It was lots of fun when it was BYOB but now they have their liquor license - oh well! The only thing that has gone a little downhill with this place since they opened is the takeout - not same quality as it used to be and not as good when you eat there
Thai food is SUPPOSED to be HOT! The food alone was enough to make this place hot, but the outstanding service and value will probably force them to move to larger accomodations
Every dish was quite special, drinks, appitizers, entrees and desserts
There was not a single thing out of place
LAND IS DELICIOUS AND INEXPENSIVE
THEY HAVE SOME OF THE BEST THAI FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN
THE HOSTESSES ARE FRIENDLY AND CALL YOU ON YOUR CELL PHONE WHEN YOUR TABLE IS READY
DEFINATELY EAT THERE
The other reviewers AREN'T related to the new owners or on hallucinogenics
Food here IS top-notch while amazingly, the prices are bargain-basement
Delivery 'S so fast you'll swear the order takers are clairvoyant, and both eat-in and delivery are recommended (we've observed that the tiny digs get a bit overextended at peak times, especially since it was still BYOB when we ate there in mid-April, so take-out's a good option)
Fantastic Thai tea excellent chicken wraps, tho' all we've sampled was good
This by far is one of the best Thai restaurants that I have ever been to
I have never tasted such amazing curry dishes not even in Thailand
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a cool ambient place to eat with amazing Thai food
Found this place just walking by
The great smell (of rice) inside the restaurant made us wait for a table
We were very pleased
The food was great
The prices are excellent
You can leave your number with the host and he will call you when it's your turn
we were waiting there for 20 minutes and he really called people on his list one by one
We really liked the food (and the salad)
Excellent prices
main dishes below 10$
Portions were great too
Drinks (some pear cocktail) were excellent even though on the expensive sida at 9-10$
Will definitely go there again
Just like my dream my dream comes true to finally found a very good Thai restaurant on the upper west side
When I first walked by I told myself that I've got to come for dinner there one night without any expectation other than the excitment of having thai restaurant in the neigborhood
After dining there with my friends I have got to give Land an A plus because of everything there are more than what I expected
All the dishes are authentic thai

nice place,romantic
It was my boyfriend's birthday and had heard great things about Daniel
All of them were true, the three course meal for $85 was great for the electic selection
Wine selection was amazing
Service was Unbelievable
They overheard us talk about his birthday and brought out a dessert with a candle in addition to the 2 we had ordered
Truly sublime food, wonderful service and superb attention
Ask for a booth
I was visiting New York and used the citysearch to find a good restaurant
I was very impressed with Daniels and it was the highlight of the weekend
The service was simply awsome and the food not only tasted good but was elegant in presentation
Had a wonderful meal here recently
It's been a few years and I am still very impressed by the taste and innovativeness of the cusine
Service was very attentive
Who else is better in New York? Well, I have yet to try Alain Ducasse
Ah, someday
The most exquisite and sumptuous preparation of French dish which I have ever experienced
Not to mention the fact that the service is awesome and the hosts and hostesses are very courteous
Such an experience dining in this very elite restaurant
Garlic bread is perfect
My wife and I recently celebrated our 20th anniversary with a weekend in NY and dinner at Daniel
We couldn't have chosen a finer restaurant
The restaurant is romantically decorated in red, the staff was professional, friendly and attentive to our every whim
The food was magnificent as each mouthful was better than the last
Highly recommended
Dinner for two, champagne and tip was approximately $400
00
This restaurant is not only gorgeous, the food is magnificent
Every aspect of our dining experience was superb
Top-flight cuisine, amazing wine list, wonderful service from a helpful and courteous staff
And, for the money, an excellent value
We will definitely be returning
expectations were high so there were a few disappointments (i
e
mistake on the check, overly salty morels stuffed with foie gras) but overall, Daniel's dishes are revelations in taste
Service is dramatic and romantic but you really feel that they want you to spend more than you're willing
My vote for best French restaurant
Terrific food in a fabulous setting
The service is first rate
You get what you pay for in this French jewel
Recently, I went to Daniel and was extremely disappointed
I was surprised because the last time I had been there it had been amazing, but it was a long time back when the restaurant was still located in the Surrey Hotel
This time, I ordered the tasting menu and the only two dishes I enjoyed were the squab and the sorbet
For $120 (without wine) it was a major rip off
Daniel is quite simply, the transcendent French haute cuisine dining experience in NYC
Go, and bring your platinum card!
If your part of the family your in BUT otherwise:  --forget complimentary appetizer --dropped a spoon down the back of my wife's dress---no apology --food forgetful --seats on top of each other
A must go for a once in a lifetime treat!!! It's absolutely magnificent for impeccable service, lush decor and most importantly, the most exquisite food that one has ever eaten
It is pricey, yes, but it's definitely worth it because, like I said, it's a once in a lifetime treat!
This place is the best in the city
I have never eaten anything as great as this was
If you can get a corner table you can see the entire room while eating in elegance
The staff was so friendly and attentive
It is really expensive, but you have to come here
This is the best of the best overall french experience I've ever had in NYC
Decor, Service best of all, Food - all great!!! Everyone on staff was in perfect form and attitude
Then again, if a party of 6 were to spend ~$1800 plus 2 bottles of wonderful vintage reds
I'd expect everything to be as perfect as can be for that kind of $$$
Empty tables waiting for the rich and famous while we were kept waiting over an hour beyond our reservation time (and we even showed up early)
Worst of all, the Maitre d' did not care
If the money you spend is meant to be for the overall experience, then Daniel is a waste
There are plenty of excellent restaurants that treat you with respect in the city - don't bother with Daniel
Daniel is the best French restaurant in New York
The food tasted exquisite, the presentation was outstanding, and the service was excellent
It truly made a wonderful and memorable dining experience
Last year I took my girlfriend to Daniel for her birthday
Major disappointment
The main course was oversalted, the waiter was perfunctory, and it took 45 minutes! for the cheese course to arrive
When we kept asking about the hold-up, the headwaiter finally came by and said that there was only one cheese cart in use that evening and it would be awhile
The best measure of food is its memorability
i don't remember a thing from that evening except how poor the experience was
Never again
I'd been wanting to dine here for the longest time
While the dishes were certainly well executed, I was not impressed with the lack of flavors
(Apparently I quot;missed the pointquot;, as others have told me that Daniel is about bringing out and celebrating the NATURAL flavors of food, and not overpowering them)
But for $125 p/p (no drinks), I prefer less bland food, and more FLAVOR
I will say however that the desserts were AWESOME
Atmosphere, while elegant, was way too formal for my liking
All in all, I was glad to have gone, but wouldn't return
To give you a sense of my taste quot;levelquot;, I'd prefer Gigino, Gascogne, Isla, Calle Ocho or Bouley
Not an inexpensive restaurant, that's for sure ! But everything is just perfect, from the hosts, to the bar, to the tables, to the decor
The food is equally superb and tasty ! I was just disappointed with the wait
When you spend $170
00 per person, you don't want to sit at the bar for 40 minutes and wait for the table ! Specially if you have reservations ! Other than that - JUST PERFECT ! Became my favorite place in NYC
Worth the visit
And the price !
I was truly lucky to get to enjoy an amazing meal here in the winter of 2002 and the food was stunning, the room sumptuous and very comfortable
Service rises snottiness and pretension to be truly unique---engaging and expert
Don't miss the cheese course here
My wife and I both had the tasting menu here--something like 7 or 8 courses, each one nothing less than sensational
The staff was incredibly attentive, but not intrusively so
The decor is French pseudo-classical--lots of pillars and hanging vines--and the crowd is an enjoyably odd mix of rich old folks, moneyed young business types and past-it rock stars
Best meal I've ever had, even if it did take me days to process
This is MY FAVORITE PLACE in the city! By far! Yes, its eurotrashy and loud
But that's what makes it fun!!! On wed and sundays they close the curtains and have people dancing on the table! My favorite thing though is THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!! So yummy! The artichokes with almonds and cheese, yum! The gnocchi with truffle oil, yum! The waiters are young and hot
and are very flirtatious and dance with the patrons! The food is great! The atmosphere is fun!
I have heard so much about this place
Besides the art work and trendy euro music, the experience sucked
Horrible service, below average cuisine, asked to leave the table before finishing our wine, and forced to have our port at the bar
When I pay $130 for two, I want to enjoy my time

Can accommodate large parties
Lovely brunch
Wonderful shepherd's pie
Fionas is a great UES pub that serves a mean burger
Just dined there with a party of seven from age 2 to 92 - all had a great time
The food is very good, the owner is very nice, the waitstaff is great, the place is clean, everyone is friendly
it's a great place to hang out, and it especially shines when you want to watch a sporting event, domestic or foreign
I needed to plan a last minute surprise party for a Sunday night meal for 18 people
After phoning around 7 places, Galil was the only kosher place who agreed to book the back room for us without charging us a fortune for a set menu
They were so helpful in setting everything up
The night was a hit
The staff were friendly, the food came quickly and was very tasty and the privacy of the back room made for a terrific night for our surprise
I even had a centerpiece delivered there in the early afternoon and they called to let me know it arrived and then had it set out on the table for display
The gentleman I worked with was Mayor - He is the manager there
I would definitely do another dinner there with a large party
They made things so easy!
This place serves up delicious Moroccan food and is one of the best kosher restaurants I've been to in Manhattan
The Jerusalem Mix (combo of chicken, beef and livers) is excellent but the lamb tagine was what stirred my enthusiasm for this place
It's a bit pricey but worth the experience
We have eaten here a bunch of times and have always enjoyed our meals
Maz Mezcal is very good mexican food for a reasonable price
The food is not overly inventive but you can not go wrong here, especially with their seafood
The shrimp with rice was delicous and was such a large serving that I took the rest home because it was so good
The margaritas are average and the service is ok but this is a great place to eat outside during the summer
After hearing this was a fun neighborhood restaurant, I was eager to check it out
My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night
I ordered the sea bass
Our food arrived and the fish was cold with congealed butter sauce forming a Jelly pool around the gelid fish
I took a bite and it was totally disgusting! I explained to our waiter the situation and he returned a few minutes later with the same dejected plate of fish (microwaved)
To make matters worse, the old lady owner accosted my table demanding to know why I returned the fish
I explained the circumstance and she spat How dare you insult our food, Um, excuse me
I was the one served the damaged plate of food! There are too many beautiful restaurants in nyc to waste time at this place! They treat their customers as crappy as their food!
My only major complaint is that every time I visit this restuarant, it is a challenge to get a refill on my beverage
They take my glass without offering a refill, and then I have to flag someone down and ask several times before my drink finally arrives
I have been to this restaurant 8 or 9 times in the last few months, and this is a constant problem
true mexican fare at a restaurant where customers are appreciated
alway`s had a great time
Please
we brought a 7 year old and a 2
5 year old and the owner/waiters bent over backwards! Sombraros for everyone a whole library of childrens books and best of all fast and efficient service
This restaurant is a find for parents aunts grandparents etc
and the food is great as well
I only go there in the summer when I can sit outside
The food is good, but not very exciting or creative
The outside seating and good drinks are what draw me there
We've been going to Maz Mezcal for years; it's a solid, reliable Mexican with good food, service and value
It's not your typical Tex/Mex place
It's a level above that with some different and very good dishes that are variations on your standard Tex/Mex fare
The chorizo appetizer is great as are the Flautas Combinadas and seafood dishes
And, the Margaritas are some of the best and most potent in town
A good, solid Mexican for when you're in the mood to spice it up!
Been eating at Maz for about 5 years now
and don't know of better mexican on the upper east
food is always quality and the service is always attentive
and the margaritas pack a punch
The arroz con pollo is exceptional as is the rest of the menu
I don't understand the complaints about pricing? Good food ain't cheap, cheap food ain't good
don't we already know that?
WHEN I CAME HOME FROM MY ITALIAN HOLIDAY, WHERE I HAD SOME OF THE BEST FOOD IN THE WORLD, VESPA WAS MY ITALY AWAY FROM ITALY!!! THEY SERVE FRESH AND INOVATIVE DISHES, BUT WITH A FEEL OF HOME COOKING, JUST LIKE IT SHOULD BE!! THE STAFF IS FRIENDLY AND ATTENTIVE AND THE RESTAURANT IS VERY INVITING!! IT'S MY FAVORITE RECOMMENDATION, ESPECIALLY ON A BEAUTIFUL EVENING, YOU CAN SIT IN THE GARDEN !!! GRACIE VESPA FOR GIVING ME A LITTLE OF ITALY IN NEW YORK!!!
manager really knows his stuff at this heighborhood favorite boit'
food is always consistant and the staff always friendly well air conditioned restaurant
My wife is high matainance and these guys really do well with it
I love the fun eclectic wine list
good job
I went to Vespa on Friday Night (after researching on citysearch), on an important date for our 1 year anniversary
As promised by the gentelman at the door a wonderful and amazing table in their beautiful garden was delivered
I can't say enough about the garden, not to mention how attentitive and professional the staff was, which complimented the food as well
Unbeleivable squash blossoms, and pork chop with salad
Great music good food, good wine, the best of the upper east side by far, if not NYC! We Will Be BACK!
The outdoor dining area at Vespa is to die for
Its romantic and cozy, and yet brimming with a vibrant and fun crowd
Most places are either romantic but dull or crowded and loud
Vespa is a perfect blend
I love it
And the food is fabulous
For my appetizer I ordered their pan roasted clams
They were delicious - tangy with that right touch of spice
My entre was an old favorite - their Cavatelli - I am still unable to cheat on it and get something new
Its very heavy and you will feel stuffed after the meal, but its one of those things that are bad for you but you just cant say no! I highly recommend a bottle of their 'Barbera d'Asti'
The first sip will wake you up
It's rich, flavorful, and not easy to forget
Great meal! Will keep going back for more!
Have been here a few times
The ingredients are super fresh, the menu is inventive and the outdoor garden is a piece of Italian heaven
Plus there is good music and a gorgeous bartender
GOOOOOOOAAAAAAAL
Any outdoor dining space in New York is a gift, but the garden at Vespa is truly an oasis
Along with the experienced staff the intoxicating food and extensive wine list make this culinary experience near-religious
Went with my wife on Sat nite 5/20/06 at 8
Made a res
that morning
Don't try this if you're arriving after 8 because it gets packed
Garden seating on a nice night is the way to go, nothing wrong with inside though
Food was very good
I wouldn't say superb
We ordered two appetizers, the mozz
with beefsteak tomato and seared scallops
Scallops were perfect
Mozz/tomato was ok
Needs nicer mozzarella cheese and sliced for us instead of being served in 3 balls

Everything was great from beginning to end
I enjoyed it enough, it's a nice looking place
I agree with the last person that the service was a little too eager to please, and they kept asking us if we were finished with our main courses
And filled the sparkling water glasses with ice water
Overall a pleasant experience, but for that kind of money I would rather have dinner downtown, since nothing on the menu was that interesting
A beautiful setting, passable food, but amateur service
When we made the reservation they played the game of moving the time by 15 minutes
but the restaurant was almost empty for most of the meal
Servers tried to clear the appetisers while we were still eating
Water glasses filled by reaching across the table crudely and interrupting conversation
Wine came after the food, although ordered at the same time
Friendly and well intentioned but continual bungles
Poor value for the price
So fun! I've been to Django 5 times now--twice for drinks, once for lunch and twice for drinks
Such a great looking place, with service, and food to match
The monkfish is awesome, as is the steak au poivre
If you just want snacks the cheese plate is great--and the french fries are fab! So crispy! The molten chocolate cake is also totally worth it
It's the perfect place to go with work people, parents (v
spacious) or to hang out with friends--total find
Definitely worth the trip cross-town and great for meeting friends after work! I loved the food with good-sized portions (great steak, escargot and the chicken was very tasty NOT boring) and the service was fabulous
The waiter was able to offer great advice from the menu, which is always a plus for me
The decor is beautiful with a lot of attention to detail
The large space makes it comfortable for a large party as well as a romantic or friendly dinner for 2
I was disappointed with the food
it wasn't worth the price
There is definitely a French accent to the place
The decor and ambience was great
It is a nice place for large groups
It's a nice place to go to after work or if you have a big party but if you're looking for gourmet food, this isn't the place to go
The restaurant is totally beautiful! Love the space, great for big group lunches or dinner
Waitress didn't know anything about the menu, but other than that I would recommend
Mussels were great, burger was cooked to perfection, fries were good (but unexpected since the waitress told me it didn't come w/ fries), dessert was ok
I would go there again!
django's adds great new spice and pazzaz to the midtown area with its sparkling tassles hanging in the window to its sleek bathrooms and bar scene! the food is simply exquisite in taste and presentation
the service went above and beyond by having several people check and make sure all was well with our dining experience
definitely one to revisit and recommend!!!
I love their mussels
It was so delicious
The sea scallop is a must-try as well
I didn't get a chance to try their entrees, but the appetizers left a good note in my mouth
For lunch or dinner, Django has been a great addition to the city's restaurants
Service is fine, atmosphere pleasant and food great
Good selections (for dinner) and tastey eats
If you like escargots, you'll love them here
I haven't had a chance to dine here yet but highly recommend it for drinks
The place is very attractive, has a good (not mundane) selection of wines by the glass, and compared to the midtown hotel bars they don't sting you too much on coctails
Exceptional bar staff as well! And this place hasn't really been discovered yet so you are likely to find a seat at the bar, or you can even sit at one of the downstairs tables for drinks
I live a block away, so I was pleased to have a shabu shabu place nearby
This place is not worth the convenience
I don't believe that the seafood and meat here is the freshest; nothing seemed spoiled but there was that look and smell of slightly older meat
The vegetables all seemed of fine quality
What spoiled it for me is the atmoshphere - it's just too bright and the layout feels like a jr
high school cafeteria
Hot pot/Shabu means getting a plate of raw veggies your choice of meat/fish/seafood and cooking it in your own pot of boiling broth, then eating it w/ a sauce you've mixed yourself from the sauce bar
Great portions, decent selection great value
I also like that it's not in the center of chinatown
They are clean and the waitstaff is friendly
This place is not good for groups of 6+ unless it's during non-peak hours
They do not take reservations
The serving is of good size and the service is very good
Although the ambience of like most typical chinese restaurants, it's bright and clean
The iced green tea is yummy here
It's very fun with you go with a group of friends and of course, everyone has his own pot
I would recommend this place if you're looking for a hot pot or shabu restaurant
Price is also very reasonable
This place is great
While I didn't enjoy it at all to begin with, my girlfriend kept dragging me back and now I love it
A definite acquired taste
But if you go in with an open mind and a recommendation on what to order, it can be a really fun meal
The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh
It is a great chinatown experience and a great deal on a dinner for two
I've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago
Set in an old bank, the high ceilings are an atypical setting for a chinese restaurant
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA, but few out here
For those unfamiliar with shabu, it's like sukiyaki, except you cook it yourself
very fun and fresh
The person below obviously does not know much about asian cuisine
If you really wanted a Chinese restaurant that serves dishes type food, why would you come to a place specializing in hot pot or what the Japanese call Shabu Shabu? I guess the person did not do much research
Don't pan the place just because you were looking for something that this place never advertised to be
Hot pot is very common in Asia, and is enjoyed by groups
The different dipping sauces ensure that everyone gets something they like
And, it's a fun experience to cook on your table!
The cleanest restaurant I've seen in Chinatown
You have your own hot pot, dish of various Asian vegetables and you can pick any meat or seafood for less than $10
Its healthy and I love going there with a group of friends to hang out and eat
happy shabu shabu is great for groups
i have only had lunch there but i cannot wait to try it for dinner
the waitstaff is friendly and attentive
the food is fresh
the place has high blue ceilings which makes you feel like you are outside chilling with your friends on a lazy afternoon
i highly reccomend this place
The Scene Despite the pastel-colored murals and bamboo wall-hangings, diners still feel like they're in a Marriott as opposed to the Big Island
But that doesn't deter the tourists and Financial Center workforce, who come for fruity drink specials and out of fondness for one of the 35 other Roy's world-wide
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy
The Food Dishes denoted as "Roy's Classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs
"Roy's Canoe," an appetizer sampler, is a must for groups: it includes buttery crab cakes, Szechuan-spiced pork ribs, and delicate shrimp potstickers, along with unfortunately chewy coconut-battered shrimp (a non-asterisk dish that the waitstaff is happy to substitute out)
The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets
I cannot stress the magnificence of this place once you find it
It's perfect if you have people you want to impress, a certain someone you want to spend quality time with, or friends you just want to hang with
The ambience and serving are welcoming

(at any price range)
I've been to Kittichai twice now with the most recent visit on May 20
For Thai fusion, the food is tasty but for the high price and small portion of the entre, it's definitely not worth the hype
The restaurant is trendy and great for people-watching but overall, it's not value and expect to spend $75+/person for Asian food
One final comment
I was very annoyed with the hostess on my most recent visit
My friend checked in her coat and on our way out, she gave the hostess the ticket
She held onto the ticket in her hand while taking reservations on the phone and while greeting incoming traffic
After 5 minutes of watching her, we got annoyed, took the ticket from her hand and gave it to the hostess #2 standing beside her
No apology and hostess #1 just kept talking on the phone
Very,very unprofessional
The food was mostly good - some dishes were very spicey
Small portions
The rice did not even fill half the bowl it was served in, thats cheap! The only benefit is that you don't overeat and have space for dessert
The decor is cool
except for cheap formica tables instead of real wood - come on! The service-the main server was attentive yet we got the check before we had finished dessert or the wine
He did say take your time but still
! I had called the day before to order the chocolate dessert as a surprise B'day cake for someone in our party
The cake never came but teh check did - When I finally commented to the hostess - all I got was a dumb look and so sorry! Was very disappointed with service
Despite what some reviews state, We were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation (party of 2)
That's not bad for a trendy, upscale NYC restaurant
I made reservations on Open Table and confirmed via telephone the day of
The service was excellent, the cocktails are fabulous, and all the staff is very friendly (not to mention good looking)
The four of us went to Kittichai 4/12 to celebrate friends Bday
To be honest, after reading all the comments about the bad service, I was hesitant to book it but made the reservation anyway
We had a very good experience: prompt seating, attentive service (may be they read all the negative feedback and did something about it), nice ambiance and a fun menu
After visiting Thailand in February I can assure you that food at the restaurant not traditional but rather modern/creative Thai; it was beautifully presented and tasted great
I would recommend to make reservations through OpenTable, since when you call the restaurant they make you wait forever
The only thing Kittichai has to offer is a pretty pond in the middle of the restaurant
The service was incredibly slow and the manager was VERY rude to my friends
The food is good, but nothing to write home about
Kittichai was a disappointment and did not live up to its undeserved hype
This place is terrible
I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they enjoy receiving bad service
I went there with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and were seated at a table for four
The host came by and told us that they made a mistake and would have to seat us at a two-person table
10 minutes later two people were seated at the same table we were kicked out of
They were not celebrities and worse yet, there were plenty of empty four-person tables around us
When we questioned the host about re-seating us, he responded rudely and continued about his business
The food was also unimpressive
Everything was too salty
We were so disgusted with the food and the attitude that we left before dessert
Don't go there!
Went here on a date
so cute
I loved it
Food was so very good, it was nice and dark, lychee drinks were awesome
decor was so cool
Great Place, can't wait to go back
Now thats Hot
I went to Kittichai this past saturday
We placed our food and wine order, the waiter came a few minutes later to tell me they were out of the prawns, since we had ordered white , I picked the codfish, which was very good
Towards the end of dinner, they set one table next to us, I wals impressed with the late seating and all
For my surprise, the waiter brought one of the guys the prawns
When I asked why he got the prawns and I didn't I was informed that he had been complaining about the wait for his table, so they could not mess up twice
We were offered desert for the incident
, which we were not in the mood for
but isn't feeling special one of the biggest things on dining out??????????
I went here last night with a few friends and was seated immediately
The decor is really pretty - especially the pond with the floating orchids in the center of the room
The food was good, esp
the chilean sea bass and chocolate short ribs
yum!  The only complaint i have is that we waited almost half an hour for our dessert and waiting to get our coats took a while
Previous reviewers are right about the wait, a 9:30 reservation seated at 10:15
The service is disorganised, no one gave us a menu for 15 mins once we were seated, but after that it went smoothly enough but no where near the stella performance of many half as pretensious restaurants
However the food is mainly fantastic and the prices not so over the top that you don't feel you've got value for money
Just try and get a table away from all the shreiking wannabes
I took some friends from out of town
The service is VERY poor, when I mentioned it to the waiter, he replied that he was very busy and was getting slammed
The food portions are TINY
I would not recommend to anyone, and will not be back there
Went there Sunday nite and restaurant was very busy
We were promptly seated
But It took 15 minutes for the server to greet us
The Dining Room is visually stunning and well designed with ample space btw the tables
Menu prices are very affordable
Unfortunately I am allergic to fish and the Chef uses fish sauce in every dish but 2 and was inflexable about not using it
My friends did enjoy thier meals
The waitress was friendly but did not know the menu and had to run to the kitchen after each question
We were seated 40 minutes after our 9:30pm reservation
For waiting, the host comped our drinks which was nice
The crowd was alright, we requested to be moved because the party next to us were very, very loud
The food was decent
I would recomment the pineapple fried rice for a side
Had some star sightings
Naomi Campbell was eating near us and ran into Usher in the restroom
CONS: The service is horrible!! The place is way too dark
Both of us had to go put the menu to the candle to read it! Our waiter never came back to check on us, refill our water, tell us the specials, and etc
it seems like maybe the customer to waiter(ess) ratio is pretty bad
Plus I was not seated promptly with reservations
PROS: The place is very pretty although on the dark side
The food is fantastic especially the crispy fish
Go for the food
Expect that wait staff to ignore you!
I still dream of the Sea Bass! The food is excellent! Everything was exceptional
The decor is beautiful
I can't wait to come back!
Went here for dinner tonight and loved the dimly lit room with center pond scattered with floating candles and colorful Orchids strung above
The food was good, my friends Bass (on the menu) was mouthwatering and probably the best of all our dishes, appetizer and tapas were a little on the salty side but otherwise good
Unfortunately my duck was served barely warm and not hot but was tasty

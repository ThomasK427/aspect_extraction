I stuck w Tapas and got the shrimp/garlic butter, escargot, cured ham, and churrasco -- all were a solid 8/10
My buddy got the sardines and is STILL raving about them 3 days later
I would certainly recommend going -- especially if you've got a group or b-day party
Great service from the waitstaff and maitre'd as well
Went to Flor De Sol with my dearest friend but only that was enjoyable
We arrived on a Friday and after sangria and tapas were given our check although we had not asked for it
Put off by this (we wanted entrees) we asked for the menus again
5 minutes later a waiter approached we have a slight problem - we have a table to 8 coming need these seats, would you move to a table on the stage? Followed by we need the table by 9:30
No one helped us move to the new table (which by the way was a small table and a small wooden chair
Never did a table of 8 come in
The area was then filled up with 4 tables of 2
Service was rude
Poor showing
Turned off
_________________________________________________________________
Flor de Sol is a lot of fun, from the romantic yet raucous atmosphere to the incredibly talented live flamenco musicians
The food is tasty--not great-- but there are many choices from tapas to entrees, including vegetables, meat, and fish
I especially recommend the sauteed spicy mushrooms, chorizo, calamari and octopus
Definitely try the tres leches for dessert
Our waiter was a bit confused, and plates did not necessarily come out together or in the right order
But they make excellent house sangria (choice of red or white), and charge reasonable prices for a good time in such a trendy neigborhood
I visited Fleur De Sol because a lot of my colleagues rave about it
I took my boyfriend there for his birthday for a nice lunch
I loved the decor but, the food was not much to rave about and kind of disappointing for Manhattan
The service was not attentive at all
I would go there for the atmosphere but, not for the food
It's very average
Wow I was amazed how lovely this place was
I was only here for drinks, that were excellent I must say, The martinis are amazing
The service was excellent
I love this place and would definitly go back next time for dinner
I read all the reviews and was a little worried, but I had a recommendation from a few trusted friends and am so glad I listened to them
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the experience could not have been more wonderful
The food was great
The services was laid-back, but I like that
They let us sit and enjoy ourselves and not be rushed
Even when the place filled up, they told us to take our time
Drinks were great and the food is amazing
The neighborhood is great and the band was perfectly suited for the atmosphere
My experience was wonderful and I would definitely send people there
We had a wonderful experience here! The drinks were wonderful, the food delicious, and we had a great time with the bartenders and servers
DON'T go there hungry for lunch or dinner! Some dishes way too tiny
My usual i'm too full friend was starving
Space is romantic but service is a bit lazy and aloof at times
Great location though would recommend for drinks
the food was so-so and the service was terrible
our waiter was never to be found, as he was also the bar tender
he gave us our bill before we even finsished and said I hope you dont mind, but I closed out your check for you
I will NEVER go back there
I love this place
The Sangria
the food
I do not have one complaint
They have one of the best Paella's I have ever had and the tapas for 2 is highly recommended
The place is very romantic but beware it does get a bit loud
I took 2 friends from out of town here because I'd been twice before and had great experiences
This past Saturday was a different story however
We had a 9:00 reservation and were finally seated at 10:15 after asking about our table twice
Then the service was extremely slow
The waiter was very friendly and the sangria and food were great
I don't even think I would have minded waiting at the bar for over an hour if it weren't so crowded and if they had little tapas for the hungry people forced to wait!
I and my friends enjoyed the atmosphere and the food, both very much
Everything we ordered was great and the place has both a great look and feel to it
Myself and my entire party had a thoroughly enjoyable experience
The only slight negative point, would be the music was a bit loud, which made it a bit too difficult to converse throughout the evening
Combined with the crowd noise it was a little loud
My suggestion to management would be to tone down the level of music slightly, but other than that it was a great time
if you love tapas and you don't mind a rude and inattentive staff of employees, then flor de sol is the place for you
it's such a shame because i've been here several times hoping i'll enjoy the experience a little more, but every time i'm disappointed by the service
the food is definitely good and the atmosphere is lively, but it certainly doesn't seem to be worth the amount of attitude that greets you at the door
One of the best Spanish restaurants in the city
Ambiance, Sangaria and Tapas combine into a fabulous experience
Order anything
There is nothing that is not perfectly delicious
It's like walking into a restaurant in Spain
I have been here a couple of times and I would recommend this place to anyone
If you plan on having dinner and would like to try the tapas, the Tapas Mixta is the way to go
They give you a little bit of everything and the portions are big for tapas
It's perfect for 2-4 people
I love their Sangria
so that is a must
They must have 1/2 dozen different flavors but I always stick to the classic
If you love Spanish food
give this place a try!
Great food and great sangria
they offer a variety of flavors
i totally recommend the passion fruit and the tropical sangria
great for groups
prompt service and fun atmosphere! totally recommend this place!!!
great tapas
Nice flamenco shows on tuesday nights
Friendly staff
what a let down, all the tapas tasted like precooked, the paella was watery, but worst of all, the clumsy service
I thought i was gonna enjoy an european/spanish evenning, but Flor de Sol is another latin joint trying to cash in the wonderful Spanish heritage
Great place to take out a date
Had some very good wine! and the best 3 leches dessert I've ever had
My boyfriend and I went here on New Years Eve and had a great meal! The food was delicious (and I am a very picky eater) and the atmosphere was very romantic! This is a great pick!
This was a great dining experience overall, with great food and a wonderful atmosphere
I planned a little dinner party here for about 6 friends
There weren't that many patrons on the night we went so our server was very attentive

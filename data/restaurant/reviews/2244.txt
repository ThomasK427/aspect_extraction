I love the fact that I don't have to deal with the onterage of in expereinced theater folk flooding to carmines or a similar place
BRAVO!
I was drawn to this place because I heard that there was a large selection of drinks and that it had a nice atmosphere
Whoever told me this had a COMPLETELY different experience
Maybe it had something to do with us not being white or part of the Hell's Kitchen scene
Whatever the excuse was, the staff was rude and barely even paid attention
We weren't even offered a dinner menu and the waitress didn't even notice that we wanted drinks until after I ordered them from the bar myself
After finally getting our drinks, I had high hopes of enjoying the night until I tasted the drinks
If we wanted to drink Dimetapp, Vicks 44 and Nyquil, I would have spent a third of the money at RiteAid
At least there, the cashiers smile and acknowledge my presence
I would NEVER return to Vintage let alone recommend it!
I've been here twice and had a similar experience with the owner/manager, a gruff tough guy who acts like he is working in a Hell's Angel's clubhouse instead of a lousy martini bar
I gave the place another try only to encounter the most obnoxious bartender ever
I have never given 0% before
I went here recently with a group of my friends on a Wednesday night
The service we recieved from the waitstaff was less than friendly, they seemed to think that they were doing us a favor by serving our drinks
My fiancee approached the manager on our way out to tell him of our displeasure with his staff, he looked at her and said I don't need your business and then cursed at her
I will never go there again, and urge other to keep on walking
I've been coming here for years and I love it! And judging from all the familiar faces I see, I'm not the only one who's made this their regular stop
It's a relaxed, fun place
The staff is sassy and young and give good service, even when the place is packed, which it can get on the weekends
The food is good to excellent, and the drink menu extensive--they say around 150 martinis and around 50 bottled beers
I had dinner there the other day with 3 friends
I had a steak which was very good
My two friends had a Ceasear Salad with chicken and my other friend had Penne Vodka
The meals were very good
I was surprised at the selection of the beers that they had
I had a Chimay Blue, and my two friends had Martinis
It was a cool place
We will be back
I recommend this place
Althought they are quite expensive all the Martinis here are worththe price
Bar staff is excellent and always make you feel welcome
I haven't tried a lot of their menu however their appitizers are tasty and fairly priced
True, the decor left something to be desired for someone looking for a really nice pre-theater dinner place, but I disagree with the other reviewers -- the food was flavorful to a point where others might find fault but I thought gutsy and refreshing (pepper-crusted steak); the people and place unpretentious; the service very attentive and friendly
A large salad, two delectable entrees and a bottle of wine came out to a reasonable $70
A bar with a fine dinner menu and cool people working there
This was not one of my favorite places to eat
It was loud and the wait staff was unfriendly
The food was so-so and was a little pricey
Seeing that Vintage isn't far from us, we've gone back a few times hoping that the previous time was just bad luck
After our last visit, where we left after being ignored at our table for 10 minutes, I have to say this place has serious problems with service
The food, when it finally comes, is ok, and there is a huge drink menu, but the drinks are very expensive
I don't mind paying $10-$12 for a fancy cocktail in a place that spends some money on decor and offers good service
At Vintage, it's just a slap in the face
I don't recommend dining here
It might be ok to sit at the bar and get some nibbles, if you don't mind paying a bit more than you should
You can do a lot better on 9th than going to this place
DO NOT GO HERE! The previous reviews were probably posted by the owner
This place became the first restaurant that I tipped 0 (as in zero) dollars
The wait staff was rude, my noodles were raw, the tables were wobbily, and it was VERY loud
But worst of all, the owner/manager was the rudest person in the whole place
I thought I would do him a favor and inform him of my displeasure, but he decided to throw his own tantrum
During our pleasant conversation, my waitress spilled drinks on him! In short, STAY AWAY! I joined this board specifically for this review
The Scene A happy-hour Pamplona
When the quittin' bell rings along 6th Avenue, junior execs spill out of glass towers and herd to the bar of this raucous and masculine steakhouse
The assorted dining rooms have an urban hunting-lodge motif, adorned with mounted bronzed buffaloes, lions, bears and the like
Around 8pm, there is such a din that you'll need a megaphone to converse
The Food Huge steaks, well aged and cooked to a turn, rival those of the city's more famous meateries
The T-bone is exceptionally tender and flavorful, as are the broiled veal chop, plump lamb chops and roast prime ribs
The star of the menu, though, is the magnificent crab cake, a thick, loosely bound puck of sweet lump crab with very little breading, all charred and wonderfully salt-flecked on the outside--it's costly, but worth every nickel
The standard steakhouse desserts are fine
I have a huge bias writing this review, this has been my fav resturaunt for years now
Nothing comes close, every element of it is just perfect
i realize it is costly, and I am not wealthy by anyones standards, but its worth the big bucks; even if it costs more one day ill save up to go
I just cant say enough great things about this place
My husband picked Ben Benson's for our last trip to NYC and it did not disappoint
We were seated promptly, service was good and not over the top, and the steaks and sides were outstanding
I liked the decor as well
I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly
Caesar salad was also awesome, as was the bread they serve
I would go there again and again and again
Excellent! The French Onion Soup was delicious, as well as the Goat Cheese Salad
Prime Rib, garlic, spinach and peppers was fabulous
The Portabella sandwhich and Grilled Rib Eye are also delicious choices at this fine establishment
With dessert at Ben's, you can't go wrong
Try the Chocolate Exquisite!
I only eat the Roast Prime Rib, not the Prime Rib Steak
The former is cooked as part of a larger piece of meat and then carved off while the latter is individually cooked
It makes a *HUGE* and crucial difference
I don't go much for the steaks as I like mine pan-seared and then oven-cooked while most steakhouses broil their's
However, the Creamed Herbed Wild Mushrooms and Creamed Spinach are my favorite sides and the Lump Crabmeat Casserole and Salmon Tartare my favorite appetizers
The only bad thing I can say is that George the Maitre d' treats people, even regulars, shabbily
I've heard a lot about this classic steakhouse but had never been
A buddy and I went for lunch one day and Benson's did not disappoint
The steaks were delicious and perfectly cooked
We shared a couple of sides(creamed spinach and hash brown potatoes) and they were both delicious
The waitstaff was very friendly and knowledgable
Even though we didn't have room for dessert we split a piece of cake
This place is the REAL DEAL!
I ate here at the age of 18 with my brother and four of our friends
The service was great so if some say it isn't its because they must have had no respect for the server
The food was even better true its a bit price but well worth it
I consider the atmosphere to be fun for the lack of a better word
My wife and I love steaks and we were looking forward to a great new york steak experience
This was, by far, the WORST experience we have ever had
A few reasons: 1
My wife had to send her steak back *TWICE*
2
The staff was pushy 3

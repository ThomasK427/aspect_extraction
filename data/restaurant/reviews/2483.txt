Even their cabernet is delicious
I highly recommend this unpretentious restaurant
My wife and I were visiting from Texas and were referred to this restaurant by our hotel concierge
We had a great experience
Part of this was due to sitting outside on a perfect summer night, but the food was delicious and the service good
We had to wait a short time in the bar, and the bartender gave good wine recommendations and even let us taste a couple of choices before we ordered
The waiter did a good job on a crowded evening
The staff was friendly and helpful, not always a given in NYC
The total bill wasn't cheap, but was fair for an excellent overall experience
We will come again
This is a wonderful restaraunt
We were seated immediately despite it being very busy
We had the sushi appetizer special which was just delicious and perfect for two
We both had the Wasabi crusted tuna which was magnificent and a generous portion
Our waitress was very attentive and made for a really wonderful evening
We would absolutely go there again and recommend it to friends
Our bill was very reasonable
I went with a group of 5 early on a Sat night with reservations so it wasn't that crowded when we got there
Service, ambiance and food were all great
The things that makes this place stand out for me is that in addition to having the fancy fish dishes they also have everything available simply grilled which is what I like
Everybody I was with had fish and everyone loved their meal
Try the chocolate fondue for dessert - excellent! Place is somewhat noisy but I'd go back
The service here is often rushed, inattentive disorganized
We waited quite awhile for drinks, olive oil, bread (each presented in a seperate trip) and then the kitchen sent out our entrees way before we were finished with our oysters, so they were sent back to sit around in the kitchen
They sent our food out again, but the table was not bussed of our oyster tray, so again, it had to be returned
Waited waited for more wine
The bill was presented to us featuring two items we had not received (one we had ordered but was later told was 86'd) and the other had been a glass of wine the waiter said was extra on his tray--meaning he forgot who ordered it and would we like try it, complimentary of course
I do not take friends here because the service is uncomfortable and embarrassing
I've been to Ocean a lot of times and the food is always great! They also have a great lounge area where you can relax and eat, it's full menu service
A great UWS restaurant!
this is one of my favorite restarant even though i live in east villege, i go all the way to columbus avenue only because of this restaurant
it's the best raw bar!!!! it is absolutely fabulous and the manager is nice too
We were kept waiting more than an hour past our reservation time
After we got seated, the service was good, but the food, surprisingly, was not! My french toast was cold and gummy
My friends' dishes also did not look good
There are places with much better food at better prices
My friend and I went in without a reservation one evening and despite being crowded, we were seated promptly
The waiter and staff was attentive and had terrific suggestions
The grilled tuna was terrific and the bill fair for such a great establishment
I usually go to Ocean Grill's sister restaurant, Atlantic Grill, on 3rd Avenue, simply because it is more convenient for me, but recently visited Ocean Grill for a Sunday morning brunch
I can't personally speak about this restaurant's later dining experience, but for brunch, it was excellent
My lobster salad was delicious
I will definitely go many more times
I cannot count the number of times I've eaten at Ocean Grill, that's how often I go
I love it, plain and simple
The tuna with wontons is by far one of the best dishes in the city, the raw bar fantastic and the sushi chef specials are a great way to start
I love it because it's local (much closer for me than Blue Water, which is also on my Fav list) and a great experience all around
Service is always great, down to earth, the place just feels like home
I've been here about three or four times, once just for drinks
For me, the raw bar and specialty cocktails are the highlights, and if you sit in the bar area around sunset, it's a nice view of the museum
My favorite fish entree is salmon with pumpkin ravioli, though my boyfriend swears by the tuna, or the steak
It's a nice, if not amazing alternative for those of us who can't afford Oceana
Ocean Grill has always been my favourite Seafood Restaurant in NYC
Great Oysters, well executed entrees and Sushi
A must try is their Carb Buster Maki Roll, and out of all their entrees i love the Chilean Sea Bass and the Halibut
I've been tempted by the great location for outdoor dining more than once, but the food has always been terrible and the service even worse
I went recently for brunch and will never go back - my glass of wine was vinegary and obviously old, my food gummy and disgusting, and the service totally ditzy
The waitress seemed totally confused, and then to top it off she dropped a steak knife on my mother! We laughed it off but I was horrified
Ocean brings to the West Side what many restaurants have tried but failed to do - a fresh and diverse menu, excellent presentation, pristine service and an elegant and spacious atmosphere
I dine here 3-4 times a month, and in my experience the service and quality of the food has been consistantly good
A definate recommendation to those who enjoy seafood and a quality dining experience
While my girlfriend and I have visited all of Steve Hanson's eateries, we always come home to Ocean Grill - his most personal and friendly spot
Erin the manager greeted us like family (as always), and we had a fabulous server in Steve, who guided us to some great special appetizers before we shared the soft shell crab
We had a blast, but then again, we always do!
Of all the B-R Restuarants this one was the WORST! Not only did we wait a half hour past our reservation time for a table, but our waiter got pissy when we didn't order alcohol
He then proceeded to leave us hanging while he focused on larger parties ordering bottles of wine
One of the attendees I was with had a food allergy that was made aware of ahead of time and they still proceeded to bring foods containing the allergy-filled ingredients
When asked for a manager, somone else took care of the problem (who was fabulous)
Also, neither our waiter or busboy ever came back to ask if we wanted more to drink or even refill our WATER glasses
I had to go to the table off to the side and get the water myself!  The food, though when made properly, was good
This fantastic edition from the B-R Guest series of NYC restaurants (Blue Water Grill, Park Avalon, etc
) is completely worth the cost, which will definitely set you back plenty
The atmosphere shines with celebrities, twinkles with romantic lighting, and is surrounded with mouth-watering aromas of delicious food
Although this is not the place for those light in the wallet, it is worth the cost of saving up for a special occassion or just an everyday meal
We waited an extra long time just so we could get a nice table only to be sat at a very cramped table (at 9:30 on a wednesday
not that crowded)
Then our food took about an hour only to have it be the wrong order
The food was BAD- and i have eaten here before and liked it
I sat and ate my dinner while my boyfriend waited for them to correct his order
By the time i was finished, his food showed up
They did try to save the night with free champagne, but i guess they end up doing that a lot
They should have given us a discount instead of the champagne
I have been to this restaurant about 3 times and I am absolutely in love with it! If you love seafood and great ambience, then this is a must! The waiters are very attentive to your every need and the music is varied including some upbeat rythms
As an appetizer I definitely recommend the crabcakes they are so scrumptious! This has got to be my new favorite restaurant! The prices are about 25-40 for an entree, not too bad, although a bit pricey when you add in the appetizers/salads, drinks and desserts, but it is well worth it!
My husband and I love this restaurant and visit at least once a week
The food is awesome
excellent raw bar
the best shrimp dumplings and crab cakes
We prefer the cozy bar area and usually order a full meal and eat it right at the bar or at one of the cozy little tables
The staff is extremely courteous
and now that we're regulars they go out of their way for us
Beth at the bar is the #1 bartender in the world!
We had to wait 1 1/2 hrs
for our table, as opposed to the hour they said, then we were seated in the very back by the kitchen and the lighting was horrible, there were big round windows where you could see into the kitchen, the fake lighting from the kitchen was gleaming onto our table, clashing with the mood lighting in the dining area
The worse part was the food
We ordered two medium steaks, one was perfectly cooked but the other completely brown, no pink to be seen
Both tasted a little dry
We also had lobster, a little rubbery and seemed a bit shy of the 1 1/2 lbs
it promised
Place was okay, the food was definitely not worth the money, however the appetizers were good, we had the jumbo shrimp and oysters

It's very rude and a real bummer when you've gotten yourself all primed for their food
Living in the Heights I'm not sure there's any other Indian restaurant here
It was a nice surprise that this place has decent food
I've only tried the lamb kurma and samosas, but the menu is really extensive
There is certainly worse Indian food to be had, and the price is reasonable
Plus they have a large delivery range
The salmon curry was a surprise, very good
Samosas are great and travel well for take-out
It's not listed,but they'll do a side of spinach curry
best take out in neighborhood
Always good their take-out
Am happy to have Indian food in the neighborhood
Try the lamb curry and the samosas!
I've been all over the city and had pizza from just about every best place, but this is the only one that keeps me coming back
The big slices are always fresh and baked just right
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried starbucks coffee before it became well-known and had thought great
Too bad I didn' think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabolous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and servive does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never dissapoint you
The restaurant part of Beema Grill does not seem sure if it wants to be a sports bar or if it's trying to be something more
The menu has standard burgers other pub food, plus a few fancier pasta and fish items - none of the food knocked our socks off, but it wasn't awful either
The PRICE and SERVICE were great, so that definitely helped
A very professional place
I met up with some co-workers/business associates for some drinks and dinner
The bar was not so corwded that we could not talk to each other in a comfortable voice
The Bartenders were great fun with a sense of humor
Dinner was delicous and service was great!
In the vast wasteland of diners, delis, and sports bars in this area, Tupelo Grill is a hiddent jewel
The food is creative and delicious; the service is excellent; and the ambience is quiet and peaceful
You would hardly believe that you are right across the street from the Garden and Penn Station
I highly recommend to anyone
Fine for a Pre-game meal if you don't mind overpriced pseudo-cuisine, but I wouldn't venture too far from the steaks
Service is fine, ambience is lacking and a little heavy on the testosterone
That said, can't beat the proximity to the Garden, its a great size/set-up for a large party, and not a bad place for an after-work beer if you're into that BridgeTunnel Penn Station crowd
Whether its a pre-Knick game dinner, or a business lunch, Tupelo is the place to go if you like Service and good food
If you want to truly feel special, ask to have Elizabeth as your waitperson
She lights up the floor and makes everyone feel like they are the only customer in the restaurant
The bar scene is good too and if you like eating outside in the summer, there are plenty of outdoor tables
Finally, a truly excellent restaurant at Madison Square Garden, Tupelo blew us away from the moment we walked in, the manager was professional yet completely charming, a great bar scene and a menu to die for, as you can tell I loved it! highly recommend the crab cakes, sea bass skewers and Tupelo lemonade
The pizza here has been perfected and is the best slice that I have had in Manhattan
The sauce, the dough and the cheese are always fresh, but don't expect a place to sit and eat
There are five stools to eat at while the cook stands next to you
We've tried most of the bagels on the Upper East Side and these are the best
Properly crispy on the outside without being too crispy and chewy on the inside
Always fresh
I've lived in this neighborhood for yrs
and we all love this bakery
The products are perfectly baked and it's real buttercream folks
The prices are very reasonable and the service is extremely courteous and upbeat--and no pastry nazis! This is old-fashioned craftsmanship at its best
And this is the way our European ancestors did it
Keep up the great work
Old world bakery, that has alot of history and charm
OK, it is very unassuming, and the ownership doesn't seem too interested in keeping all those shelves full, but that's because it is your neighborhood bakery, not some tourist destination changing with time to keep up with popularity
The customers and neighborhood know how good it is! Northern European Immigrants built these types of places, and nobody should ever forget about them
Cookies, coffee cakes, brownies, and butttercream are all served with a big hello and smile from someone who probably got there at 6am, wearing sweatpants, and couldn't seem to be happier
Reminds us of home!
Delicious home made ice cream and wonderful friendly service
I love this place!
The food is quite good, and reasonably priced
What really impressed me is that over the weekend I left something there and when I called on Monday, they had it waiting for me
That really impressed me and made me so happy
Of course it's something that everyone should do, but in NYC I rarely expect it
So for this alone, they have my loyalty
And the food is good!
Great falafel
Pretty much everything there is really good
And not too expensive
Good quick lunch or dinner
Amazing for a quick but filling meal when you're on the move or you want to get some food in your system before a night of drinking
Gyro and Falafel sanwiches are your best bet, but everything is great
The escargot was tender and sweet, the wine terrific, the cod and martinis, the atmosphere, service, lovely
No complaints whatsoever!
I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about - maybe they were rude to the staff! This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Manhattan - the Steak au Poivre is out of this world - better than any steak house in NY
The service is excellent
The waiters are extremely attentive and the food is absolutely fantastic
I am a very picky eater, and most people's recommendations to me are lowsy
Take it from me, you WON'T be disappointed
The waiter at Bistro du Nord was extremely rude to us when we visited the restaurant on Sunday afternoon
Also, I witnessed that the waiter was yelling at the customers! I could not believe that the cozy-looking restaurant had the WORST service among all restaurants in Manhattan
If you want to be treated nicely in a restaurant, I would recommend NEVER visiting Bistro du Nord
I had my worst experience for a brunch
Me and my fiancee had been waiting for 20 minutes in the entrance, and we a table eventually became free, the waiter did let sit a couple of people who had just got in, even after my fiancee argued with him and the couple that this was totally unfair
So if you want to eat in a place where customers are not respected, and the food is just average
I am from France and I feel that this place is a shame for my country
Olives along with the bread are complimentary
The bread was rock hard, but the olive assortment is nice
The salads were pretty good, but the main courses (salmon, skate, chicken) were pretty mediocre, although the portions were good
The berry dessert was pretty good
We would not go here again based on the food quality to price ratio
I had the most exquisite three hour long meal
Every dish was wonderful

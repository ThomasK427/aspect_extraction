Go there and get the ripper!!!
Simply put, one of the best places to grab a slice in Jersey
Located on Rt
3 in Clifton, NJ, Paulie's offers a thin, crispy, perfectly balanced pie
Timing is everything though, their re-heated slices just arent the same as a fresh one
Go around lunchtime, or very late at night (Paulie's seems to get busy from 12-2 AM )
There are just 5 or 6 stools in front of a counter, no place to sit
I don't even know if they serve anything but pizza, but they've been around forever and everyone raves about it
A must-try if you're in the area
In Short Boomerangs, Aussie flags, kangaroo portraits and faux aboriginal art honor the homeland's wilderness, but Outback delivers a polished version of rusticity with varnished blond-wood booths with matching wainscoting and casually uniformed waitstaff
Besides more than a half-dozen cuts of steak, diners can pick from large-portioned entrees like ribs, chops and shrimp or chicken "on the barbie
" The Bloomin' Onion, a large onion dipped in batter and deep-fried, is an appetizer with a following
It is a great spot to go to before the croud comes rushing in! I am a vegetarian but eat fish and had a delicious tuna steack that was so tender it melted in my mouth! Their veggies dishes are also very tasty and fresh
They have a large variety of wines from different countries and best of all the restaurant is completely none smoking! The only set back is that the restaurant gets really crouded and loud
It's best to come early or to make a reservation
We went to the one on 3rd and 56th and it was so great
Such great food but for something other than the rip off price
pretty good wine and beer selection
service is good
i was very pleased to find one in the city!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The food was nothing special, the service was rather slow for a weeknight
The table setting was very cheap looking, seemed like a brown paper bag was placed on the tables
I didn't recieve any additional napkins nor a lobster bib when eating my meal, thought it was very messy considering I had asked the waiter for some extra napkins
People have rumored that this place has the best steak on the west side of the Hudson, but I would beg to differ
For a supposed upscale restaurant, the food was average, the ambience was bland and the service was horrible
I went to impress my girlfriend's family for a nice evening out, but I ended up regretting ever going to RPT
If they don't change the staff at this restaurant, I would have to say it's on the downswing towards gourmet history
You can risk it if you want, but don't believe the hype
If you are looking for an upscale dining experience, skip this restaurant, spend the $6 toll to goover the bridge and head into Manhattan
This is a restaurant that charges upscale prices and provides you with unwarranted attitude and bad decor
Though we had reservations for 8:30, we were not seated on time
When we were finally seated, the menus were just left in a pile on the table
The waiter was extremely rude to us, telling one member of my party, Don't order what she's ordering! No wine list
When I asked for wine, the waiter said No
I suppose he was trying to be cool or funny
I don't appreciate that during a meal anywhere
Water glasses not refilled
I was sorry to have wasted an evening at this establishment
I still can't believe how rude the staff was
The absolute best porter house steak I ever had
Would go back every week
A restaurant that has been in existence for quite some time should have the mind to hire a competent and polite staff
They were nothing but RUDE
There was one female waitress in particular that absolutely had the WORST attitude I have ever witnessed
She was disrespectful to elder PAYING patrons
As the table was cleared, they spilled sauce all over my guest's clothes, managing to stain both the dress and shawl
It took almost an hour to get us the bill
No apologies, no accomodations
Every patron had to go to their server to pay the check in order to leave the establishment
The female server did nothing but walk around complaining about how miserable she was and that she didn't want to be there
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! You will only walk away with a greased stomach and extremely poor service, if you can call it service
They tired to serve us T-bone steak with a separate piece of fillet mignon on the side as a porterhouse steak fot two
When I complained about this to the manager, she curtly replied that I was wrong
She further stated that all restaurants do this and should be pleased that they included the extra piece of fillet mignon
This was the second and final time that they will pawn off a t-bone cut as a porterhouse at my expense as we will never return to this restaurant
WOW
I've been to some great steakhouses, but the River Palm is my favorite
Not only are their steaks top-shelf, but their lobster tails are second to none
Order the surf turf, and get the best of both worlds! They have a good wine list, gret mixed drinks, and outstanding dessert (the tiramisu is my fav)
Their staff is also very professional
Nice ambience as well, especially after the new rennovation which boasts a greatly expanded bar area
A MUST for anyone in the area
I've been to all 3 RPT locations
Although I prefer Mahwah (less crowded than Edgewater, cozier than Fairlawn) the food is consistently excellent with with a broad menu, and professional wait staff
The wait is usually minimal with reservation at Mahwah
I have not had better steak in NYC!
Good luck finding a better porterhouse for 2; Luger's is maybe 1% better, but RPT's cottage fires are unique and NO ONE can touch them
Great Filet
Wine list is very good (Sparks is better) with some good values
Occasional wine specials include magnums of Silver Oak
Overall, no one in NYC can touch RPT, including Old Homestead
Try RPT in Fair Lawn, less crowded
I had taken my San Francisco guest to Peter Luger's this summer at their request to try what they heard was great things of the steaks and the abusive waiters
the food was mediocre and the staff was pleasant
We then went to the River Palm and the steaks were outstanding the service was great, better atmosphere etc
why make the trip to Brooklyn when everything you need is in your own back yard
The RPT is a really nice little steakhouse if you don't want to hoof it into the city
Its easier to get a table and the meats are very good
Not quite as good as the countries best, but better than some stalwarts in NYC
I've been around the country and have tried some of the best (Harris', Lugers, Hereford House, etc
), RPT is a B-level place which is well worth the time and money
Enjoy it
Filet was somewhat of a disappointment--not much flavor and on the tough side
Prime Rib was cold and very fatty--Drinks were good though--Very expensive--I've had much better for less
This is always my first pick for any special occasion
Yes, the steaks are phenomenal, but that's just the beginning
From the clams casino through the house salad with blue cheese (on the side, please) to the outrageous sorbets and ending with the sinful mudpie, THIS restaurant is # 1
The food is everything; the waiters are great, but they essentially don't honor reservations (wait with reservations of 30 - 45 minutes are typical)
The food is as good as the service
I recommend it to friends all the time
Great service, steaks as good as any steakhouse in New York
Fish entrees are also outstanding! Sometimes you need to wait for your reservation as they tend to run late, but once you eat, you did not even remember that you waited
Been going to River Palm Terrace for years
Don't believe it when you hear the best steakhouses are in NY
There's three River Palm's in NJ, all of which arguably tops any steak place in NY [Keen's (NYC) and Flames (Westchester) are very close runners up]
Steaks are dry-aged (surely a choice of the discriminating chef)
The porterhouse for two is the best cut in the house
I always eat it by myself
Per dollar, you get more for your money at River Palm
River Palm is surely a distinguished restaurant, with Edgewater being my favorite location

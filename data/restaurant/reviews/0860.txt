I was seated near Frenchie (think American Idol) the current star of Rent and someone who seemed like her manager!! The staff manns the scene very well
My friend and I noticed how quickly and carefully they accommodated two large business groups at once! The owner (in stilettos!) emerged from the kitchen carrying orders! Very nice indeed
The atmosphere is comparable to Northern Italy marrying a stylish New York lounge
I definitely recommend this experience to anyone from or visiting New York
Now this is a restaurant that takes pride in its service
my friend and I recently picked up and dined at Andavi and found their prices to be reasonable, their servings hearty and their approach refreshing; the owner herself circulated the room introducing herself and asked customers if their meals were prepared properly! I guess we're returning to how small businesses really should be run! Andavi will definitely see my return
We were serviced with a smile and weren't rushed up when done
The food was really good, and the place, was p a c k e d with flawless people
The owner of the restaurant was going around introducing herself and asking
Recently I visited Andavi while on a business lunch with clients from out of town
The food by far was the best Italian I have had to date in the West Village
I had the Garlic Shrimp to start- absolutely devine
My entree was the Penette Vodka and it was just as wonderful
To top it all off- the portions were the largest I have seen to date!!! The service was wonderful- very accomodating and very family like
My server was very impressive by his knowledge of wines and details on the munu
Andavi will be around for quite some time, and I surly will return as often as possible
The Scene The neighborhood's barflies and gourmands converge upon this airy, timbered room, where wide retractable windows open onto a bustling corner
Think Metropolitan Home meets Tuscan farmhouse: The blocky wood tables and a sleek bar welcome everyone from brunello-sipping business sophisticates to casual groups on the cheap
The down-to-earth owners--a triumvirate of Otto, Lupa and 'ino alums--are generous with wine tastes, pours and pairings
The Food The pan-Italian menu forgoes the appetizer-entree format in favor of fairly priced small plates, which quickly add up
It's hard to resist another order of those deep-fried herb-laced "suppli" rice balls, egg toast with whiffs of truffle or polpette meatballs in tomato-citrus sauce
Artisanal cheese plates, interesting affettati (sliced meats like culatello and prosciutto) and well-crafted sandwiches--spicy chicken tramezzini on squishy bread; slow-cooked porchetta with fresh horseradish--invite sharing
Everything is a la carte, so round out the meal with refreshing grilled fennel-asparagus salad
we easily snagged a great outdoor table on a hot muggy night around 6
i recommend sitting outdoors because the tables are adequately spaced apart, unlike the ones indoors
the service is quite good -- the servers are attentive and friendly, but we found the food to be just average
overall, the dishes are over-peppered and we could barely taste the other flavors in the polenta/bean dish and fennel salad
in addition, the meatballs had an odd canned/processed taste to them
in the end, the only dish i really enjoyed was the shrimp wrapped in crunchy pancetta
the wine list offers a nice variety
I went here with friends this past weekend for a late lunch and it was incredible
I'd wanted to go here for several months and am sad it took this long
We ordered a flight of three cheese (all of which came at the waiter's recommendation and all of which were amazing) and two moderately priced bottles of wine--a riesling and a rose--both of which were excellent choices
The atmosphere was casual yet hip and despite a drunk party taking pictures of themselves and wooing loudly, the overall ambience was quite nice
An experience truly worth the wait
First time, we got there early sat right away
Second time, got there near 7, waited 45 minutes only to be told to wait 30 more minutes
Ethan, the host, was quick to pick up our next wine order
Wine bar is small
But the wine list goes for miles in the other direction
Must try the truffled egg toast w/ bottarga-your mouth never had such a delightful experience
You can hardly go wrong with most of the menu
Fontina, onion, rugola, tomatopesto panino is great, calamari salad w/beans so tasty and a very exciting selection of cheeses - try the 2 latte robiola! Service so knowledgable and pleasant the entire time, even though it's packed almost every minute
Can't read the menu? Ask your server
Chad did a fantastic job explaining every section
Can get a bit spendy, worth every penny
decor - rustic
I loved the downstairs! food - CHEESE! I love the cheese the egg in a hole!
service - fine
My experience here was incredible
The food was outstanding (try the shrimp dish - yum) and the service was even better
We celebrated 2 girls birthday's that night, and there were 10 of us all together
They sat us immediatly and catered to everyone
I can't wait to go again!
My only beef was the popularity of the restaurant that forced us to wait for a seat
Even that wasn't too bad since the service was so good
The staff catered to us in a way that we felt we were being taken care of during the wait
Speaking of beef, the Wagyu (Japanese beef) panini was amazing! A generous portion of sliced, marblized beef that hardly needed any chewing
The beet salad had a touch of tangy and sweet; orange, roasted hazelnuts, shaved cheeze with a perfect pinch of mint! The chicken salad was very well seasoned, flavorful every bite
A homemade riccota cheesecake was shared to top off the dining experience
I mustn't forget- the coffee was excellent (no shabby Mr
Coffee machine used here)
My only regret was that I didn't come with more people so that I could taste more dishes
I had been looking forward to going to 'inoteca for awhile
The service was fine and the ambiance was particularly Roman (in the basement, and in a good way)
But the food? There is nothing more insulting than overpriced, bad Italian food
We sampled from pretty much every part of the menu and were left disappointed on all counts
The salad (arugola) was average
The tramezzini, dry as a bone
The speck was the fattiest speck I have ever encountered
Two of the cheeses on the cheese plate were dried out
The final insult was the frittatti di capri
What
was
that? It was the least flavorful thing I have ever tasted
$100 later, all I could think about was how else I could have spent $100
My friend and I stopped in there on a Thursday night after attending a party down the street
It was crowded, but we had a glass of wine and didn't wait long before a table opened up
Because it was late, we just shared a few small plates - the food was excellent and it was perfect for a late night bite
We had no problem with the service either
This place is great for hanging out with friends, sharing good food and good wine, either before going out or after
We both said we'd definitely go back
We arrived without a reservation Friday evening (3 people)
We were told the wait would be 30 - 45 minutes
That was totally acceptable and we found some great seats at the bar
We were celebrating and decided to splurge on wine and some apps
We noticed a couple tables settling up and waited patiently
When the time approached about a one hour wait, I asked the hostess about our seating status
She said she was waiting for a four top to open up and we could be seated
Next thing we knew a party that walked in way after us was seated at the table and again told to wait
We appraoched the server about overlooking us and she just looked at her clipboard and shrugged her shoulders
No attempt at all to try to take care of us or accomodate
Very poor hostess
we left frustrated by the experience
Great food, great service, good wine, but please translate the Italian stuff on the menu for us non-polyglots
Grazie
I was pleasantaly surprised by my whole experience at Inoteca
I was intimidated by the menu - which is entirely in Italian, and the wine list - which strictly lists Italian wines, but my waiter - Nathan - was quick to help
The service was some of the best I've ever had, and the food was authentic and delicious
The atmosphere is happening, yet not tooo hipster

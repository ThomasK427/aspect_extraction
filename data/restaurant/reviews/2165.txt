satisfied? not in the least
Fantastic steakhouse
Have never been dissapointed
Want a great steak in THE quintessential NY steakhouse? This is the place
Some might consider it expensive--fact is that it is but on par with the other NY steakhouses
Palm may serve other foods, but the only thing you should order here is steak or lobster
Having eaten at the major steak houses, Palm is still my favorite
Not cheap, not for models, not for delicate cuisine
This is hearty steak and lobster, perfect every time
Save up and give it a go
I came here for the food! Awesome clams oregenata, a porterhouse of 28 oz
that hit the spot, very god, not the best, but up there
Dessert berry tart, sweet and perfect
Also my family had the filet, a 5lb lobster and sides of spinach, aspargus, potaoes
Ambiance is old, and not my style, but its an institution in NY, Im not gonna change it
A little corporate but, hey like I said I went there for the food
I had heard how great this restaurant was
Food was mediocre and very overpriced
I would definately not recommend this restaurant
We visit Palm once a month
It is consistently superior to ANY steakhouse in NY and we've been to many
Ruth's Chris pales in comparison
The app's are great- chopped salad, calamari, french fried onions (my favorite)
The filets are big enough to share, and are always moist and juicy- not greasy at all! For sides, the best is the creamy mash potatoes and spinach! If you can handle it, try the desserts too- they are wonderful
The food is unforgettable and you will be anxious to return!!
If you like steak, lobster, salad and old fashioned drinks, point yourself toward The Palm in one of its three incantations
Bring $150 for two people and talk to the waiter -- no menus needed
Name your steak, size up a lobster and enjoy everything they bring to you
Lots of people will say there are better and/or cheaper places for this kind of food, and they might be right, but I've never had a bad meal at any of the three Palms
For me, they offer great food at not-cheap prices that reminds me why sometimes living to eat is better than eating to live
I went there during the Jan
2003 Restaurant Week
Despite it being a revered institution, lame-o food! The salad consisted of romaine from a bag, vinagrette and a few tomato slices
The entree -- a decent filet mignon, soupy mashed potatoes, and, believe it or not, frozen mixed veggies! (You know it -- corn, peas, carrots and the occasional green bean)
Cheesecake was ordinary -- where was the crust on this thing? And the setting -- dingy, caricature-laden, uncharming
The waiters are not even fun grumpy
Just plain grumpy
Boo!!! Go spend your money somewhere else!!!
Came here on a Thursday night around 7:30 and got right in w/ four people
Service is always top notch and the ambiance is fun - portraits and faces all over the wallpaper with charming articles and nick nacks
Food - mostly steak and fish - is decent, but the portions are obscene - filet mignon and salmon were HUGE, but they don't come with any side dishes - you have to order and pay extra for them which is inconvenient and expensive
If they downsized the meat and added sides w/ the meal, it would be much more enjoyable and practical
Desserts are rich and delicious, and the smaller portion here is appreciated
This is the kind of place you take your old school male clients who want to impress you w/ how much meat they can eat
Not exactly my speed
People being taken for a ride for poorly cooked and no longer tasty food
Very over-rated
Service poor, also
At Palm, we enjoyed the best steak on earth
Perfect service, perfect food, a perfect restaurant
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

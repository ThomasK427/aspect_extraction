Had an omelette and waffle
omelette was standard, nothing special
Waffle was a little rubbery
Definitely not the Belgian beauty I was expecting
The outdoor seating is nice, though
This place is great for brunch
Good food, good coffee, and really friendly servers
Overall a very positive experience
The place was so dark, I needed the table candle to read the menu and could not properly see what I was eating
I recently ate dinner here, and was bitterly disappointed with the cooking
The steamed mussels were satisfactory, even if overflavored, and there were 2 unopened (i
e
dead upon cooking) clams in the portion
The Beef Stew consisted of huge chunks of beef instead of the expected bite sized morsels and was overcooked; its strong flavor made it almost inedible
The Tart Tatin was the sorriest excuse for this traditional dessert I have ever been served
Instead of thin slices of apple on a short paste dough, it was just a slice of open faced apple pie made with large chunks of unsweetened sour apples; without the vanilla ice cream, it would have been inedible
They might get away serving this to Americans, but I won't be back
I'd heard a lot about Belgian cuisine being some of the best in the world
I've been to Belgium and have never been disappointed
Petite Abeille lived up to the Belgian standards
I've had dinner there as well as brunch on the weekends and I have to say the food is consistently GREAT!! The eggs benedict with salmon are my favorite start to the weekend at Saturday brunch
It's a must!!  I love the grilled lobster on Thursdays and a new favorite of mine if the seafood waterzooi (i'm not sure of the spelling), but it's a delicious seafood stew with salmon, shrimp, lobster, mussels and halibut with julienned vegetables in a creamy both
So delicous!!!
I had dinner with my sister and brother Saturday night
Our waitress was so pleasant and helpful! The bus boys were attentive- we had everything we needed without having to ask! Plus, our waitress suggested the mussels with curry apples
She said that it was hands-down the best mussels and it really was!!! Plus the fries are really good, too!! Oh
the burger looked really good but I have yet to try it as I can't stop thinking about the mussels
:)
We dined on the day their a/c was down
No attempt to compensate for that nor was staff apologetic
While waiting for the rest of my party, we asked for chips which they serve at the bar
We were rudely told by the waiter that chips are only available at the bar
We couldn't believe what we heard given that on a 95 degree day with their a/c down, we were refused such a simple request
After my husband complained to the hostess in the front, we were given the chips
This type of service set the tone for the rest of the night as the waiter was curt and borderline rude
The quality of the food was good, especially the fried calamari and mussels
Overall, I would consider returning and giving the restaurant another shot
Hopefully the service we received is not indicative of all their wait staff
Petite Abeile is a quaint, cosy Belgian restaurant with the greatest food you could ask for
The lobster is AMAZING
You get a pound and a half lobster with a small salad and fries
The thing that makes the lobster so good is the fact that it is grilled and the original dipping sauces you get
Even the fries are good! Pair that with great beer and it'll leave you hungry for more
The brunch here is quite good as well
Everytime I leave, I always dream of coming back for more
It gets busy so I would definately make reservations
Being an unpaid intern in the city, most of my restaurant decisions are determined by the $-$$$ rating
I was very excited to find a $ rated french place that came with such high recommendations
Unfortunatly upon arriving my party realized it was not going to be a cheap dinner--maybe inexpensive for french, but certainly not a $
In addition, our service was terrible, we waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to bring out bottle of wine (we decided to spurge realized we weren't leaving the restaurant with very much money in our pockets), nor was he friendly or attentive--and his section wasn't even full
all waiters have their bad nights, but the only good thing about the service was saving a few extra dollars by not tipping a standard 20% due to negligent service
The food here, as well as the beer, was fantastic
The mussels, we had the tomato based broth, and the burger, we had with blue cheese (though it was strongly flavored) was delicious
Fries were very good, and of course, I always enjoy a carafe of water placed on the table for my ever thristyness
I would certainly return and get the mussels, in fact I look forward it
Is not 'that' well priced, to rate it with a $ but is a good place to eat with some nice cosy environ and good service
Feels like home, nice vibes around, good beers and tasty omelets
especially the salmon one
yam! Like this place but i wouldn't recommend the lobster either mussels nite cause simply does not worth it
Tasteless and pretty pricy for what u get
Go there for the authentic Belgian goodies
This place was recommended to me by my Belgian friend who is a moules frites connoisseur
I loved this place- the beer is great, the mussels are fantastic, and the fries and mayonnaise are yummy! I don't remember saying anything during dinner because I was so busy stuffing my face with moules frites! Service is great and the ambience is very homy
Only drawback is that it's a cash-only place
I am a huge fan of waffles so whenever i get a craving, I stop here for waffles
They are amazing! My favorite waffles I have tried so far and I love their sauce
I also suggest their mussels and beer! A perfect stop for a Sunday brunch
This is the best spot for breakfast and great food for what you are paying
Everything is good here
i think they should teach ALL other restaurants their blanching method because it makes all the difference in the world
YUUUMMY!
The Scene The Grey Dog's Coffee has the charm of a Martha's Vineyard country home, with dried flowers, wicker baskets and an old mailbox decorating the room
Locals whittle away afternoons at chipped-paint tables speckled with ubiquitous gray paw-prints
Tasteful dog-related artwork hangs from the walls, and the friendly people behind the counter have the bemused bearing of a group of college hippies
The Food In addition to its deep selection of strong, rich coffee drinks, the Grey Dog Cafe offers a full range of breakfast, lunch and dinner items
The well-made sandwiches are especially popular, with choices like Black Forest ham with warm Brie and Dijon mustard, and hummus, tomato and roasted red pepper on toast
Beer and wine are also available
Room temperature toast, according to the cranky snob owner, is the way they serve it
He actually said that! We do the best we can, he said
So when we asked for warm toast , they put some very nice cold toasted bread through the toaster again and we got slightly charred but warm toast
It makes sense the toast is cold, because it took them 15 minutes to make two eggs over medium (broke the yolks,overcooked the eggs) with four other people in the cafe
Luckily it was all set off by cold plates and dried-up home fries
Nice ingredients, horrible delivery
Best thing in there is the small dogs with their owners
I live in LA and always make sure to visit Grey Dogs when I'm in NY
It is cozy and has great food for great rpices
The employees are quick, but careful
They are also polite and helpful
Seating is tight, but hey, it's NY! Beware of the occasional egghead trying to cut in line or save a table out of order
The pea soup is wonderful as is the olive bread
Just moved here from Northern California
Grey Dog is just what the doctor ordered
Self serve on the easy stuff
But they deliver your order to the table
You get your own tools and napkins, water, etc
The music is great
They have it going on
It is truly amazing how wonderful this coffee shop is! The coffee and the service is wonderful
I have to admit, they have the best muffins I have ever had - HONEST!!! Everytime I go there, there is a short line, but the waitstaff moves the line very quickly without leaving you feel like cattle (how do they do that??)
My fav AM purchase is a coffee and muffin, and believe it or not it costs 1/2 (I mean 1/2!) the price of the same from Starbucks

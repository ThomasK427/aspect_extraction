Try Fillet Mignon Teriyaki, Sauce is so wonderful and Try Crazy Dragon Roll
You'll be surprised
We came over from Wales to New York and fancing some sushi cam across Raku
The food was great and more than ample in portion and the service helpful, informative and friendly
I would highly recommend anyone to seek out this restaurant
Delicious food yet at affordable price
I personally recommend those who like Japanese cuisine
Because its kindly sushi chief and his co-worker, it makes me want to have my dinner there all the time
HIGHLY recommended !!!
Being a regular at Raku I on 47th bwy, Ray told me about his sister spot near where I live
Nice little place thought the decor is not as authentic looking
Sve needs some improving - they made a few mistakes on our bill also
The food/sushi tho is excellent
Who would of thought of surf turf?? Lobster filet mignon was a great choice as well as Chilean sea bass! But the sushi is just as good as Raku I but more generous (I guess the rent is cheaper up here)
So lunch at Raku I and dinners at Raku II
Helps me my wife on days we don't cook!!
This place is awesome! My husband and I finally went here after living in the neighborhood for many years and I am so glad we did
Their pizza is the best I have ever had
and living in Manhattan, I've had plenty of good pizza
The pasta dish we had was also wonderful but the pizza is a MUST try
it is out of this world! Just a warning though
they do add a lot of garlic to their food but I think that's part of what makes it so great
The owner and her son are so sweet and attentive
This is definitely one of our fave regular places to eat
And at the prices they charge
you can't go wrong!
This was the best pesto I have had since I returned from Italy
It is incredibly cheap and the food is delicious
I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fresh homemade food at great prices
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years
The restaurant is cute but not upscale
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes
I would highly recommend it
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY
I hate this
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC
Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here
However, it's not worth a special trip
It's just O
K
pizza
So sorry I can't rate this better
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing
When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen
The service was superb, they treat you like family
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food? We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh
We would return to this place again!
Nina is one of those places that you keep going back
Despite their limited menu, their food is consistently good, and different
Their pizza dough must be made differently becuase it's just right
Not too soft, not too chewy, not too greasy
I like the pasta more, esp the prosuitto one
Slightly oily, but I don't feel stuffed afterwards
They have this one hot tea thing, which you drink from a round container
It's very good and refreshing
Good Argentina beer and wine selection
Very reasonable priced
This is truly a good addition to the pass-86th UES locale
i go there from time to time and the pizza never change, constantly good, service is ok
the place is small but well decorated, wish to know the history behind the picture on the wall!
Very nice, cozy and romantic restaurant
A relative newcomer that dares to offer something different than the usual grub in the Upper East Side
Ate there twice
First time I had the pie with prosciutto (sp?) and the second time I had the pie with pepperoni
Pepperoni was my favorite
Sauce is delicate, tangy and very fresh
Dough is soft and just the right consistency and thickness
The cheese is a very interesting blend which really adds a lot of flavor and zest
Oh, I also had the empanadas as an appetizer which really got me in the mood for the pizza! Nice place to bring a date to
Service was prompt and friendly
This is definitely a nice turn from the ordinary and a very welcome addition to the neighborhood
Nina's opened five or six months ago, and is a an amazing addition to the UES
The food is so good--everything from the spinach salad to the potato croquettes, stuffed mushrooms, pizza and pasta
the service is really wonderful too, great value and cozy and romantic
their wine by the glass is great too
i have been there twice and it's already one of my favorite restaurants
This little and charming place really is serving great food and it's very affordable
the argentinian owner and his family are very warm people and i had a great time there!
The Scene Oceo's small, sleek front bar gives way to a crisply set, orange-hued, mirror-lined dining room, where a colorful theater district crowd leans back into high-backed wicker chairs
The windowless space feels like a hotel restaurant, with busy music and bright lighting, but the helpful manager and his competent crew go out of their way to make everyone comfortable
The Food When Lespinasse closed, its upper management teamed up to bring us this: a French-inspired international menu with the occasional southern twist
The appetizers are as eclectic and assured, as you'd expect: Sherried sultanas and mustard seeds offset a generous portion of seared foie gras; barely cooked lobster swim in gorgeous truffle-vanilla "shabu-shabu" broth; and sweet shrimp complement bright green spring pea soup
Main dishes, like pork loin with cumin-sauced ribs and full-flavored chicken four-ways, are upscaled comforts
Just beware of overcomplicated fish: Sharp horseradish can spoil an otherwise stunning sea bass
Cream-filled beignets dipped in lavender-laced chocolate are destination-worthy
The girl at the door got an attitude

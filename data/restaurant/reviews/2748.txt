Food is authentic and consistent, staff is very friendly and courteous for both dine in and take out
I call the friendly take-out counter at least once a week, which also means that I haven't purchased tupperware in years! They are efficient and helpful, and I've always received my complete order within 20 minutes
After 3 years as a customer, they even gave me a roll-up calendar for the New Year! The food is always fresh, flavorful, and hot
I enjoy eating in the restaurant as well because it is so clean
I recommend the cold sesame noodles, the sesame dumpling appetizer, General Tso's Chicken, shrimp low mein, and the chicken and broccoli with brown sauce
They are also very conscious of waste and never give you extra sauces unless you ask for them
We were seated promptly, were given water quickly, but weren't handed menus-we had to grab them ourselves
Our waitress brought him a regular coke instead of a diet coke, and the salsa had OIL floating at the top
I ordered Cheese Enchiladas, he ordered Chile Rellenos
She brought us our food, and his order was wrong, so she took it back
Once she returned with the correct order, his re-fried beans were extremely dry (they looked microwaved to me), and his chile rellenos were 'disgusting'
Also, their rice bears a striking similarity to Lipton's 'Fiesta Sides Spanish Rice'
I'm sure they came from a package
We had to ask numerous times for the check, which was brought to us by a different waitress
We should have known that 'Tex Mex' sign meant we were in for a gross treat
But there is no excuse for the lackluster service
Although the food here is delicious, it's often nuked in the microwave
Go for the quesadillas, which are always made fresh, or the sizzling platters
BUT the thing to get here are their margaritas, they are among the best in NY
Not too strong, not too weak, just perfect and delicious
The atmosphere is extremely festive and fun, too
This is the kind of place that is timeless
comfortable, no pressure
Homey
The food is really delicious in a totally unaffected way
It will still be greating people as family long after the places to see and be seen are long gone
there is a new chef and he is brilliant
all these other reviews are close to four years old
a lot has changed at that little place
it is time you gave their dinner specials a shot
fresh interesting ingredients, seasonal and platted with care
check this place out
I like to come here for a cozy Sunday brunch
The staff is friendly, and the food is comforting
Pancakes are really good! Try the chicken apple sausage
The wait can be a little long
Don't let them seat you in the little narrow passage way near the bathroom
It sucks eating there
Com here for large, fresh portions of creative American food in a cozy, family-friendly setting
The waitstaff here is very attentive and friendly too
Funky crayon doodles by customers adorn the walls and ceiling
The service is definitely sub-par
We were told we'd get seated in 5-10 minutes
EVERY 20 minutes we asked!! Mind you, it was only a party of 3
We were seated 45 minutes later
It's certainly not good business to string the customers with the old five more minutes routine
I will only blame it on the wait staff that probably changes every month
The benedicts were creative, I must say
The pancakes are mighty tasty
Tried their cheesburger too on a different occasion
Not bad
It's good to go there every once in a while, but it's definitely not a favorite
I've had a few good meals here, but they are few and far betwen
At my last brunch, I was told that a side order of sausage is, in fact, only one piece of sausage, and my omelette, which was supposed to be spinach and muchroom, also had ham in it
I sent it back, and we NEVER GOT A REPLACEMENT! I kid you not
I'm never going back
food used to be pretty decent, but SERVICE has ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT
the food quality has also deteriorated as of late
service ranges from super-friendly to offensively rude, depending on the server/host and the nt
watch out for the host (maybe the owner?) on sat
nts
: he is really nice if you have no complaints, but if you criticize (and sound the slightest bit indignant) over things like having people mistakenly seated before you or being ignored by the waitstaff, he can get really mean and horrible--i've seen people leave b/c of him, and him not apologize even once
he must have trained our last (new) waitress cuz she couldn't seem to apologize for getting our order wrong and disappearing constantly
i guess if you keep your mouth shut and it's not saturday, it's an ok place to eat
I enjoyed the salmon, but only after my order was taken wrong and the rest of my party had finished eating
Did I mention that they charge for every glass of Iced Tea
Oh, they also charged my credit card twice
I've never eaten any meal other than brunch here, but I've had no complaints
Any time their pancake of the day incorporates peaches, I strongly advise that you order it - they're amazing
The chicken-apple sausage is also wonderful, and omelettes are great too
Service is always friendly and competent, and any place that lets you draw on the tables with crayons is OK with me
In Short With black-and-white checkered tile, cherry-red counter stools and retro booth seating, this family-friendly nouveau diner is as homey as it is fun
Comfort standbys--including bacon-wrapped meat loaf and barbecued ribs, and upscaled interpretations--like tuna club made with wasabi mayo, share space with brunch favorites (Belgian waffles, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and wrecked eggs, or tofu)
Everything gets washed down with a bottomless cuppa joe
THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY MIGHT DO TO YOUR FOOD IF YOU GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!!! A few nights ago after eating at Dizzy's I forgot that I was carrying a bag and left it on the back of my seat
The next day I called to see if they had it and if I could pick it up
The guy gave me a very hard time on the phone about it (I couldn't pick it up that day because I had to go to a funeral) he said they were too swamped to deal with returning my bag
So sunday I go to pick it up, the woman behind the register hands me the bag, it's zipper has been ripped wide open (so it will never close again) and someone has poured the stinkyest mopwater I have ever smelled all over it, the bag and it's contents are completey ruined
So basically this petty and sadistic guy that I spoke with on the phone took out his frustrations with life out on my bag
THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY MIGHT DO TO YOUR FOOD IF YOU GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!!!
Where to start? Food-Cold
Service-Non-existent
Management-Cell phone oriented
For better food, service and price, drop $
25 in a gumball machine and enjoy!!!
The raspberry/marscapone-stuffed pancakes are so divine it's actually worth putting up with the rude and incompetent service
I'm sorry, but don't you think it's offensive to name a dish on your menu China Girl? Why is this acceptable even though no one in their right mind in this day and age would call a dish Black Boy? After complaining to the owner, who said he would change the menu, it still hasn't changed
They should be embarrassed of themselves
I just stumbled across this spot (I live in the area) and completely disagree with the last two reviews
This place has GREAT breakfasts (chocolate stuffed french toast is to die for) and the sandwiches are delicious
Yes, it's a little pricey, but definitely well worth it
Recently rent to Dizzy's for the 2nd time
Both times the food was excellent, but you also have to give them a reason to shine
I got the lumberjack-esque dish so everything was good but pretty standard, my beau was smart and got a Reuben and it was stellar - the best we've ever had! Very good fries too
Banana pancakes were amazing
not too sweet, but extremely flavorful
Huervos rancheros are also excellent
A very solid and fun place with a retro vibe!
Went to Dizzy's for brunch based on good reviews read on this site, and was very disappointed
The brunch entrees were shockingly overpriced, even for the area, and especially given the food quality

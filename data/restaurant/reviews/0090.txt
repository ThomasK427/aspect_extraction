We left stuffed
Truly a great experience - We'll be returning shortly
I had an excellent night there
Nothing bad to say, I could write on and on about the good things but I hate typing so I'll just say it was f'n awesome
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to
Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff
The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food
All I can say is WOW! The food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience! It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques
The ceiling is amazing! I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous
Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables
My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters
Our waiter was ever so helpful as he stood back and watched my sister and I physically move our table
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out
My entire family was horrified
Absolutely fantastic meal
The waiter showed us a little much of his personality, but, at the end of the day, every single thing we asked for was delivered
and then some
The food was fantastic
Definitely one of the top restaurants in the city
No questions about it
It's pricey, but you get what you pay for
Went last Tuesday evening for my birthday with my wife and son


While the food was top-notch (very tasty pasta with sausage and risotto appetizers) along with braised ribs and veal entrees that were outstanding (my wife had the salmon which she said was the best she's ever had!), the place was very stuffy
The service was almost stealth-like (things came and went but the waitstaff, including the head waiter, had zippo personality!) So, the food was worth the visit (the desserts were outstanding too especially the chocolate cannollicini!) but, overall, the meal was too efficient and workman-like to make it a memorable experience
Top notch from the entire night
Excellent service, better food elegant ambience
I will recommend this place to everyone I know
One suggestion is to make a larger waiting room, it became a little tight
You definately do not want to miss Scalini
We were seated promptly, and the owner/chef came by to see how everything was
All of our dishes were exquisite and the service was impeccable
The atmosphere was low key but with great architecture and lighting
Definately come for a date or just a grat meal
superb food, superb service the owner chef walks around gets you extra things you want
had to wait 25 minutes for table
they paid for first round of drink which was nice
do not rush you
Great menu,great food great decor(old Bouley space),shabby service
The food was good but our waiters were pushy,rude and dumb
The specials were recited to us twice by two different waiter,who described two totally different preparations
There were five of us who were willing to drop some cash,but it felt like they just wanted us to hurry up and leave
Maybe it was an off night
I would go back for the food
better than good, but not exceptionally good
menu is innovative and tasty
everything ordered was really good, but nothing was great
excellent service, great atmosphere
It was great to be supporting our city as well as eating at one of the top italian restaurants in the city! It was our first time there and everything was excellent down to the chef personally coming out and greeting us and thanking us for coming down to tribeca from the East 60's! There were so many magical sweet touches that theres no other way to walk out of this place, except to feel like you were in a dreamland of true culinary experience!
i went to eat in this restaurant recommended by friends because i'm french and it was before BOULEY rESTAURANT THE AMBIANCE LET ME THINK ABOUT FRENCH AUBERGE  VERY OLD FURNITURE SOFT LIGHTS AND MUSIC TOO THE HUGE DINING ROOM INVITES YOU TO HAVE A GOOD MEAL AND WHEN YOU TASTE THIS MEAL YOU ARE AMAZED BY THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD AND HOW TASTY ARE THE SAUCES
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO  NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
My husband and I loved 26 Seats! The prices on the menu are rare to see in NYC--very reasonable
The mussles appetizer was delicious along with my peppercorn steak
The food wes served steaming hot and the service was excellent
We will be back soon!
Where to start
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday, and as soon as we got in, it struck me that there certainly was no more appropriate name for this restaurant than 26 Seats
We were seated as soon as we entered, she took our order 5 minutes later, the food was delicious
but the Riesling could've been better, but that hardly ruined my duck with some amazing sauce, and the sweet potatoes
yum
It was $100 tax+tip  You're packed in like sardines, but its so worth it
We even started friendly conversations with the tables to our left and right
It was a first date on the left, and two unmarried elderlies discussing politics on the right
Mixed crowd
I ate at 26 seats this weekend and had an amazing experience
The service is a perfect balance; it is 100% attentive yet non-intrusive
Our waitress had a French accent and her caring and knowledgeable attitude she discplayed with each table led us to beleive she was the owner
Later, we overheard that she merely works there a few nights a week
The food is outstanding and the prices are a steal
With tax and tip, we only spent $72
We had the mussels and the 26 salad
For entrees we had the chicken the duck
Both were tender and the flavors were tastey
The portions were overly generous for both the apps and entrees without sacrificing the quality
Our water glasses were always full and our beers were ice cold
The environment is cozy
We are definitely going back soon
I highly recommend it, but make a reservation
This has to be one of my most favorite dining experiences in NYC and I've been dining out for years
This place is definitely very romantic, with outstanding food and pretty good service
What truly sets this restaurant apart is it's diminuitive size which should not be confused with it's over the top food
Dinner for two came out to $100 including tax+tip
We had: *Soup, forget what kind but it was great *Appetizer-Snails in garlic sauce, which was so good, we confused the snails for mushrooms *Entrees - We had the duck confit lamb shank
I tried both and definitley thought the duck was amazing, I'm not generally not a big fan of lamb shank but thought they did a good job here
*Dessert - Great chocolate mousse  *A bottle of white wine; only $24
Make sure you make reservations as there are only 26 seats here
Went there for new year's eve
They had a prix fixe menu with the most amazing cooked quail appetizer, then lobster bisque, followed by a divine choice of entree, and then the chocolate mousse dessert
Served personally by the owner
Very friendly and relaxed - not at all stuffy
This is hands down my new fave in NYC
After eating there for the first time two weeks ago, I commented to the person I was with that this tasted like home cooking
and sure enough I was right
The chef/Owner ,Bernard, is from the same town that I grew up in
Poitier,France
Now i knew i had found true home cooking

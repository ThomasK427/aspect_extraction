Sushi-lovers in any borough including LI and Westchester should make the trip for the best tasting, best-valued sushi I have ever eaten
Enjoy some extra elbow room at the Carmine St
locale
don't forget to make a reservation
So it is a bit expensive
so what
When I feel the need to indulge myself with sushi I always go here
The rolls are spicy and excellent, sushimi is delicious and the service is pretty fast for such a packed place
The only word of caution is that it gets extremely crowded on Fri-Sat nights and to get a table usually takes a while
It's been 3 months since my visit, and I am still craving sushi from this restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious, altho I have no idea what I ate
We had dinner in the 'garden', so the wait wasn't long at all; for August the weather was perfect
That said, my dining companion probably will not return; our waitress was very attentive to me (because I ordered the deluxe special, literally) but royally snubbed my best friend the whole night
They have a minimum purchase requirement -per person- but my dish alone should've covered both of us in cost
The waitress waited until I went to the bathroom to ask my friend to order more food
She'd have been nicer if she'd realized who was paying the bill! My best friend was pretty peeved for the rest of dinner
Great selection for all - vegetarians included
Both the sushi and regularg menu items are delicious!
every other uber-expensive sushi joint in town
portions and quality are unparalleled
Yama has gone downhill since they've become a little chain
The fish selection is limited, the quality varies from day to day, and usually mediocre to good, never great
Service is ok
Most of the sushi chefs are Chinese
You wouldn't spend good money and have a Chinese chef making your Italian food, why would you settle for them making your sushi?
I took my girlfriend to Yama for a special occasion, expecting whale-sized melt in your mouth sushi
What we got instead was sardine sized disappointment
Don't get me wrong, the sushi was fine
But it was certainly not any better (at twice the price) than the 50 restaurants within a block of our apartment
If you're looking for standard sushi at high prices, Yama's your place
If you're looking for huge pieces of fresh sushi, though, don't waste your time
You get large quantities however the fish is very bland
Texture and taste not impressive
the sushi is good
but not the best
the atmosphere may need improvement
Clearly this restaurant serves the freshest sushi in the city
Once you eat here, you will hestitate before going to any other
The size alone of the sushi is astounding
The salads, appetizers are excellent
The waiters are helpful, friendly
You begin to resent other sushi spots after eating here because the food is outstanding
This restaurant transcends its genre with heaping helpings of melt in your mouth love, I mean fish
Still, I can't help but wince a little when the tab comes to 170 dollars for a table of four, without drinks
I have been to Yama 20 or more times, and what i started to realize after hours of waiting outside in the cold is
its so not worth the wait
More than one time Ive had fish that was slimy and off tasting
In addition the tables are SOOO close, that I it crossed my mind more than once to reach my chopstick over to my neighbor and swipe a piece
!!! If you want way better sushi, at a more reasonble price, and half the wait, go to Taste of Tokyo on 13th btw 5th and 6th
You will not regret it

The Yama in the Village was nowhere near the experiences I've had with the one downtown
I wouldn't recommend it
Yama downtown is still pretty good, though they've become so popular its like an assembly line
They rush you in and out the door as quickly as possible since the restaurant is so small
Everything is extra, even ginger
For value and price, go to Monster Sushi
You won't be disappointed, though it doesn't have much of an atmosphere
The sushi is everything everybody says it is
there are huge pieces of fish and its incredibly fresh
But after you try the great sushi, try their tempora green tea ice cream
Its a really good and unique dessert
Yama has incredible sushi! The pieces and rolls are always fresh and tasty! I am a very particular and picky person and this place rocks!
If you love Sushi, you can't miss this place
I adore Yama's greatest sushi several times a month!
The pieces of fish are huge, fresh and fabulous
However, the ambiance is not much better than being on the subway at rush hour
Go for the food, return for the food
You'll wait for it as long as you'll wait on the platform for an open spot on the train
Very good food, but very pricey menu, long waits when crowded, and not alot of elbow space during busy hours
Overall this is my favorite Japanese eatery, but I try to go during offpeek hours
oh, what a dish!  But I've had better than Yama
Yama focuses more on size than quality, which is variable
And the rice could be better
My Japanese business friends with expense accounts all go to Sushi Sei
Who would know better than them?
The portions were way too big for sushi and the rice was awful
The rice is important in sushi--and not that difficult!
Good sushi - not great
Service was excellent, recommend the spicy tuna
OH, YEAH, good eats! This is the freshest sushi I've ever tasted
Plus, you could always take a date and impress them on how WIDE you could open up as you attempt to stuff in the whole pieces
Obscene!
Wonderfull restaurant in a cellar in Downtown New York
You have the stay outside a long time because it is always full
But if you arrive they tell you what time to come back so it is not that bad
It is the best sushi in New York and maybe af the whole east coast
it is just wonderfull
I don't want to start preaching, but sushi is all about the balance between rice and fish and Yama is the distortion of everything holy about sushi
Plus, they don't even serve fresh fish like Tomoe which is another breach in and of itself
This was the freshest sushi I've had in New York
Between Tomoe and Yama, Yama is hands down superior (and more affordable)
The sushi deluxe and four rolls were more than enough food for two
The Carmine street location, while not as historically significant as the one off Irving Place, gets the nod because it takes reservations
i'm surprised so many people love yama
i went to the one on irving place, and i agree- the fish is HUGE, but it's not very good
sure, it probably beats eating spicy tuna rolls from your nearby grocery store, but that's about it
if you're going to wait (possibly for a LONG while) for a table and dish out the $, do it right
go to one of the real 'best sushi' joints in nyc: sushi yasuda, jewel bako, karuma zushi, sushisay-- anywhere but yama
honestly, it's big fish, no taste
This is by far the best Yama of the bunch, especially since they take reservations

The quality of them were good and satisfactory
Nothing crazy inventive or seductive
If you want something that's satisfying, good, and want to be able to relax and concentrate on your company and talk, this is a good place
this is a great little place if you live in the area and just want to sit and relax and not spend too much
if its nice out - sit outside - they do a good job at blocking out the street
the food is good - nothing crazy but i enjoyed everything i had - long menu too - lots of options
service is really good but understanding the foreign waitstaff can be hard - i think it adds to the feel of the place though
they dont rush you at all which is also nice - its casual and quiet so you can actually have a conversation here
i had a very nice time here and im sure i will return since im new to the neighborhood
We went to this restaurant having found it in a Hotel guide offering a free bottle of wine if you dined there - and it was actually decent (Value $28)
The food was good, promptly served and hot, with portions sizes good
Staff were pleasant although sometime difficult to understand!!!!  The chocolate desert cake is well worth a try
The food was immaculate, at a reasonable price
Atmosphere was comfortable, with enough peace for conversation
The portions were just right, and if you're a small eater, you might even be able to doggie bag some of it home
The wine list is slightly pricey though
But overall, I would definitely be back there again
What a treat to have a reasonably priced restaurant in the theater district that serves superb food in wonderful surroundings
The service was fast and attentive and one could race to a performance or relax over a long meal (I've done both!) The atmosphere is cheery and cosy and great music just adds to cordiality
My only worry about writing this review is that it may make the place so popular that I can't get a reservation
Wow I was really pleasantly surpriced by this gem
It's what a trattoria is supposed to be
No attitude, no pretense,just real honest food at very affordable prices
To make it even better Maria Pia the owner/hostess makes everthing shine with her beauty graciousness
Thanks
The menu was extensive, the food was tastefully prepared and fresh
and served promptly with a smile
something you don't get in Manhattan very often
Location for the theater district was perfect and our dessert ( An Italian version of Apple Pie with blueberries strawberries with vanilla ice cream) was outrageous
What made all of this so special was with wine, appetizers, dinner and dessert for two, and tip, our cost was $60
Being a super-critical New Yorker (is there any other kind?) this is a good choice for good food, good service at excellent prices for a relaxing meal before a show
or any time
Only complaint was that they started the Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennet music as we were leaving
or maybe we didn't hear while we were eating

In Short One of three Meskerem restaurants in the city, this location features more modest decor than its uptown peers
A few steep steps descend into a dark basement space whose embellishment is limited to a mirror that runs along one wall
The menu, fortunately, matches the other locations, covering the basics of Ethiopian cooking, and includes sambosas, kifto (chopped beef often served raw), tibs (lamb sauteed with rosemary), and, of course, injera, the spongy bread that doubles as a utensil
This location (there's another on 47th) is more cramped, but has fairly quick service because of the limited space and the NYU locale
The food is pretty standard Ethiopian, and this is an affordable place to start for the uninitiated
I've always had good service here, and my friends and I try to visit every few months
This place is a small hole in the wall basement which you'd miss if you weren't lookin for it
Unfortunately, that's the least of it's problems
The food is uninspiring, the menu is meager, and the decor is nonexistent
Not worth the trip
I love the food at this place and used to go fairly regularly
However
the last few times I have been there, I have been really frustrated by strange new requirements that raise my bill
Two times I have been in a party of three and was told that 3 people cannot split the vegetarian sampler - we needed to order 2 samplers
When the food came out, there was no more food than there would have been in a single sampler - certainly enough for 3 people - but we were charged twice as much
In a party of 4, I was told that we had to buy a larger bottle of wine since there were 4 of us drinking
I'm trying a different place next time I want Ethiopian food
If you want to try something new and exotic, go here
My friends and I from Long Island never had Ethiopian cuisine and it was a very interesting experiance!   There is a sink in the back, so wash your hands because they are your eating utensils!  I Highly rccommend the Sambosa appetizer
Can be with beef or lentils (I'm a vegetarian
I had a lot of choices here)
Not so spicey
Food was spicey and eaten with the traditonal bread that is sour
Three of us ate each an entree and shared one appetizer for 51 $  The room is small, quiet, not crowded, and dimly lit with candles and green and red string lights on the walls
I enjoyed it but it's not for everyone though
Try not to kill yourself walking down the stairs into this restaurant
And I hope you're a party of 2 or 4, any other denomination and the hostess is completely baffled
Nonetheless, we ordered the Lentil Sambosa to start, the sauce they give you is excellent
We then ordered Gomen Besaega, Doro Wat, and Special Tibs
My problems really began here - the chicken dish was literally two tiny drumsticks and a hard boiled egg in sauce for $12
95
The beef was overcooked
The lamb was tough as leather
The servers - although very beautiful! - were not very attentive or helpful
The worst of it was when it became busy and our server dropped the check without asking us if there was anything else we'd like, then proceeded to ask us twice if we were almost done because there are people waiting for your table
What a disappointment
Meskerem is a tidy little eatery that I visit for lunch every once in a while
I have religiously ordered the doro wot, although I'll push myself to sample some of their other fare the next time I drop by
Their doro wot is certainly worth your while, with its sweet purees and airy mounds of injera stacked one on top of the other
Although it's intimate, I'm not sure how condusive to romance it is
Give it a shot anyway
Excellent, though slightly standoffish, service
The food here is excellent, and I get my fix regularly
Each dish is flavorful and distinctive, which is something I can't say for other Ethiopian placed I've tried
It's also a great value -- the $13
50 combo is perfect for two! The appetizers (mostly salad-like) aren't too exciting, but they serve to balance out the hot and spicy richness of the entrees
The ambiance is fine, nothing special, though the fireplace is a great touch in the winter
A dark, cozy basement restaurant in the heat of the Village
The food here is amazing
The prices are more than fair
Come hungry, ready to literally dig in (no utensils, you eat with your hands)
They offer serveral bottles of wine between $20-$25
Perfect place for a some great food and great conversation
anytime you can fill your tummy with $3
00 you know you're in good shape
Mike's has the greatest hot dogs and their cheese fries will keep you coming back!!
I love Mosto
I hestitated writing this review because I am afraid too many people will discover it as my friends have
The food is fresh, wonderfully prepared with a home cooking feeling
The staff is incredibly friendly, and the price absolutely cannot be beat
Try the Pappardelle, you won't be dissappointed!
I love the food at Mosto
If I lived closer I'd get rid of my kitchen and eat here every night
They have a decent wine selection the food is fresh and very tasty
The staff is friendly and attentive

I wont rant that it was the worst steak ever, but I wont be making reservations a month in advance and treking to brooklyn for steak anymore
Steak was delicious and cooked perfectly to order - doesn't even need the famous sauce
The menu is limited to simple but hearty and delicious food
Most of all, you go to Peter Luger's for the experience: an old school atmosphere, no nonsense waiters, and loud bustling dining room
No a** kissing here and I loved it
Don't forget desserts - Bavarian crepe cake is light as a feather
I've been to most of the steakhouses in NYC and Luger is the best steakhouse hands down
I think people go to Peter Luger having these grandiose, unrealistic expectations (as did I) and are disappointed when it fails to meet them
Yes, it is an institution
But it's still just a restaurant
And objectively, they have the BEST steaks, ambiance or no ambiance
I always have a fabulous meal every time I go
Be sure to leave room for schlag!
I don't understand how anyone wouldn't like this place
even my 2 year old had a nice time
The steak is out of this world and the sauce is to die for
Save room for the sundae
I live in Manhattan and it was worth the trip to Brooklyn
Can't wait to go back !
If you want to be coddled and reassured of your place in society, this is not the joint for you, for it is in fact, price not withstanding, a joint
But, if you want the best meal a steakhouse in NYC has to offer, welcome home
To our surprise, we were seated right away and our waiter, while gruff, was nice enough and very attentive
They turned tables over quickly, but if you wanted to lounge around, you were more than welcome
Got the regular: tomato onions w/ Lugers Sauce, and the bacon to start, Steak for 3 with German Potatoes n' creamed spinach as sides
All were beyond world class
The steak's only comparable competition was del Frisco's
For dessert, the Sundae was great
I preferred the ambiance here to any other steakhouse I've been to: Everythings a throwback, from the wooden tables to the steins and photos on the wall, and it felt more homey than any other steakhouse Ive been to
Luger's is the best, and a superior alternative to the Manhattan aristocracy of Steakhouses
We went to this place, because of the reputation and because a normally-reliable friend said it was the best steak in the U
S
It was the most expensive lunch I've ever bought, at about $125 per person, including wine
For that you get nothing that you couldn't get at Morton's, except a scary wait-staff
In fact the canadian bacon and the wine were the only good things about an otherwise regrettable experience
We went here for a late lunch a few months ago and were completely disappointed
Everyone we knew that ate meat raved about this place for years so we finally decided to give it a try
We got the tomato and onion salad, the bacon, a side of spinach and the steak for two
While everything else was amazing to say the least (I've never seen tomatos that big!), the steak was rather tasteless and dull
I know it's a taboo to use the steaksauce on the steak but I had to just to enjoy it
Even though we were pretty full, we ended with the sundae which was also top notch
It's sad that everything about this place was great (even the service and decor) except for the steak
I'd have to recommend Dylan Prime, Ruth's even the newly opened Craftsteak over Peter Luger's
It really is all about the food here
The steak is unbelievable, but a little know fact is thier hamburgers and lobster are amazing as well
I know it seems like a sin to order lobster in a steakhouse, but it really is excellent
I know everyone complains about the service and the atmosphere, but you have to remember this is not an upscale city resturant where they are going to hold your hand and kiss your behind based on how much your dropping for a bottle of wine! This is an old fashioned steakhouse, with true authentic nyc steak and the atmosphere to go with it! They would not have survived 100 years if they served horrible food
Everyone, local and tourist alike must visit this resturant at least once to experience what this city was once all about
Wow, what a HUGE disappointment
The quality of meat was horrible, the steak was way undercooked, the waiter was indifferent to our requests/presence, and they only take cash or debit? My faith in the local New York'r is shot if they really think this is top notch
It's my last day here, and I tried Spark's, Shula's, and Peter Luger's
After going to the first two, I'd rank Peter Luger's right next to Denny's for steak
They spoon the FAT GREASE over your steak when they bring it to the table
I am not joking
The only thing i did like is that it was very casual
I didn't have to get all prettied up, being from Seattle where we rarely have to get all fancy, that was nice
But the price tag was high, and the food was comparable to a Las Vegas buffet for flavor and quality
Ive been to Peter Lugars 6 times now
The last 2 times were truly unmemorable
The steak was OK, and the service as usual scked, but thats to be expected
Get ready for the tourist who have old reviews of this being the best steakhouse in America
All they are trying to do is turn the table over as fast as they possibly can, however they do it with less than a semblance of tact

We went there with clients and rang up a good $2K + bill and were basically rushed off the table once the last empty coffee cup hit the saucer
Ok if you have nothing better to do and some cashola to burn, but not what it used to be by any stretch of the imagination
Any one who has ever eaten at enough steakhouses to be able to acquire a taste to compare prime aged steaks would definatly consider Peter Lugers to be the best
Here is how its done
Start off with a vodka martini up or your drink of choice and pull up a spot at the bar
When you are seated order a few beers, a few strips of bacon, one and a half to two times rare steak for each person, some creamed spinich, and potatoes
Enjoy the greatest feast of your life
Then order any dessert with an Irish coffee and don't feel shy about asking for more schlag
If you eat too much steak and are too full to eat dessert, go for a fine single malt scotch
I went there with my mother who was visiting from overseas
Our side dishes came after the meat, while table next to us was served before us, even though they came later
The waiters are beyond rude
Their steak is tasty but I'd rather find another steak house in the land of restaurants than be treated like dirt and pay lot's of $$$$ on top of everything!  And no, I am not a cry baby for wanting a decent service
Order your steak medium rare, anything else would be a crime
It comes nicely charred on the outside, pink/red on the inside
The flavor is fantastic
These are clearly high quality, well-marbled, dry-aged porterhouses
For three people, we ordered steak for three, 3 sides, drinks, dessert, and coffee, and our bill was $183
I don't know why people complain about the service - our waiter brought our drinks and food out promptly
He wasn't very talkative, but hey, we weren't looking for a new best friend
The steaks were great! Don't order the creamed spinach, it's pretty bad
Don't expect great service, the waiters are too cocky; Too full of themselves
I went with a group of 4
We ordered a steak for 3, which was more than enough, plus several sides
Steak came very rare, although we ordered it medium
We kept it because 2 of our group liked it that way -- but I couldn't eat much of it
Service was annoyingly rude -- never even a hint of a smile from our waiter
He did do the service part well enough -- brought the food, etc
but he needed a major attitude ajustment
I will not go back
Last night was my 3rd time dinning at Peter Luger (Brooklyn) and I've been to the one in Great Neck once
Now it's time for me to give my unbias opinion
Sorry but I have to say that this restaurant is definitely overrated
I called three weeks in advance to get a table for a Wednesday night
The steak was bland and overly burned on the outside
The German baked potatoes was so burned that we could hardly bite into it
I gave this restaurant 3 chances and none of them was up to my expectation
I would rather go to Outback instead

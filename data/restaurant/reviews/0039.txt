Also, the dumpling are to die for
Some people complain about service, but I really liked the waiter who took my order, and th hostes is very Chinese in nature
When I go to east Chinese, I don't want people with English accents, but pure Chinese
The place is always crowded and when that happens, service goes down the drain
Food is ok

(Oriental Grill) has been a local favorite for its tasty Pan-Asian fare and low-key ambience
What the sparse space lacks in decor it makes up for in atmosphere
Votive candles and closely packed tables create a romantic, special-occasion feel, although affordable prices make it an every-night option
The Food The kitchen doesn't hold back when it comes to portions or flavors
The generous pupa platter--a sampling of four of the starters--includes steamed shrimp dumplings, crackling calamari salad, duck spring rolls and Thai beef salad
If chicken is a true test of a chef's abilities, then O

's juicy version with five-spice and plum barbecue sauce passes with flying colors
The Szechuan beef with sake soy glaze comes with taro root chips, a Chinese spin on steak frites
Although you may be tempted by the flambeed truffled banana wontons, the Chinese five-spice chocolate souffle is a worthier expenditure of dessert calories
our group of eight came here on friday night for dinner
we had a 9pm reservation and we were seated right away
the place had open doors and windows and a very relaxed, candle-lit type of atmosphere
the staff were pleasant and easy-going and took time to explain the specials to us as well as answer any questions we might have had
we all ordered water, and received no snootiness which often accompanies orders with no bar tab
i started out with 2 orders of dumplings pork apple and shrimp chive ($6
50 each)
the pork apple ones were more novel and the better of the two thin pan-fried crispy dumplings stuffed with a small meatball of minced meat and finely chopped apple
it came with a sweet soy sauce for dipping
the shrimp ones were also good - petite steamed
after such a strong start, i was disappointed with my main course
i opted for their famous five-spiced roast chicken ($13)
i expected it to be juicy and flavourful instead it was pretty dry
to be fair, it was more moist than most white meat that ive had, but it was still quite bland
it would be better if it had come drowned in some five-spiced gravy
it came with some scallion pancakes which werent thin fried like what im accustomed to, but rather dense and potato-ey
judging from my plate and my friends plates, portions were very large
i didnt really hear praise for the main courses, but no one had any major complaints either
two of my friends got the grilled halibut (one of their daily specials) and they both thought that it was too dry i guess that was the theme with the meat
i was really full from eating my chicken so i opted out of dessert
some of my friends split the five-spiced chocolate cake with some exotic flavoured ice creams, and they said it was good
overall, i had a good experience, but would probably not come again
I thought this place was totally overrated
Everything we had was good or ok
but definitely nothing great
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me
especially considering the prices
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get
I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups
The food is wonderful (especially the goat cheese and spinach dumplings!!!), the service friendly and on it, and the atmosphere is perfect for chit chatting and having fun
And all of that won't break your bank! I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself

was horrible! I went for a birthday party and we were charged a group rate which amounted to about $30 for a HORRIBLE plate of greasy noodles and lousy vegetables
This place is a bunch of HYPE! To be fair, I'm a vegetarian, but the place is a dump
I've had better food for much cheaper than this
I didn't even finish my meal because the horrible taste wasn't worth all those greasy calories
Who knew fried noodles could taste so bad! How is that possible? What a nighmare! Horrible location
Bad food
Overpriced group rates
This place stinks
My girlfiends and I ate at O

again last night
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident
The crackling calamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23
95 is most places, but it is $16 here
Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good
OG is a great, cozy east village hideaway
And if you love some sweetly smothered duck, man, you just can't go wrong here!
This place is a true gem for the East Village
I have yet to find better food within a 20 block radius of this place
By far the most amazing appetizers I have ever had, and if you get lucky and go when seared tuna is the special of the night, you will not be disappointed
The service is more than attentive, and they also have a $10 corking fee so you can bring your own wine
I highly recommend this place
This is one of my favorite low-key restaurants in Manhattan
I just went there for my birthday and loved it
It was my 3rd time and I'll be back soon
OG provides excellent Asian influenced fish and noodle cuisine with unbelievable deserts
Not too expensive compared to other restaurants of this caliber
Tasty,yummy, delicious is how i decribe the meal i had
The flavours were amazing and the food was fresh, nice atmosphere, great service and EXCELLENT value
You never know what you'll find in this city's culinary landscape
And you never know where? 55th St
doesn't seem like a foodee destination, but here it is - the most authentic Japanese udon house I've found
The choices of noodles, flavors, vegetables and meats is overwhelming at first, but you'll get used to it
The waiters are happy to make interesting recommendations to novices
On each table there's a variety of sauces and spices, which you're encouraged to add to your dish; by the end of the meal you mind up with something completely different in your bowl from you started, but it will still be so satisfying
It looked like the Japanese version of the menu had items that weren't on the English menu, but I am sure if you ask everything will be explained
this is a wonderful noodlehouse, possibly some of the best udon i've had on the eastcoast and its also one of my favorites in the continental US
Sushi is always very good
Since they are a noodle house they specialize in udon and other noodles
this is highly recomended to all noodle and sushi lovers
I went here for lunch and ordered the sushi combo
It came with a (small) salad, large bowl of udon, and 6 pieces of sushi plus wrapped rice (not sure what that was called

Try getting one of the 'silent' Martians to talk to you while you're there
Overall, a fun experience, just don't expect filet mignon
My friends and I go to Mars when we want to drink cheap after work
You can't go wrong with half-priced drinks and appetizers
The only thing that bothers me about Mars are the creepy costumed aliens
My husband took me there for my birthday and we thought the place was unique! I am very particular about food and service (having much experience in the business) was outstanding
The characters were great for children and adults! The service was a little slow b/c they were very busy, but they were friendly and the food was ready in no time
We would, and have recommended Mars to many people who have also enjoyed their experience there
This place is disgusting
We went there b/c someone suggested it would be good for our kids
We waited over an hour and were eventually seated at folding tables with vinyl table cloths and folding chairs
The food seemed microwaved and I never want to know what goes on in the kitchen
Restaurant was not clean
Some of our kids were scared by the aliens walking around
Service was bad at times
Not a good value either
Stay away, get pizza and grilled cheese for the kids somewhere else!
Visited with a group - made us wait outside in the cold rain over 30 minutes
One of our party was disabled and needed to use the elevator
It was locked and we were told it would take awhile to find the key
Food was so-so, service slow, very hard to find way around - easy to get lost finding rest room
NOT a fun experience - although the resident alien was a nice touch
Definitely WONT be going back
First of all, this place is hard to find at night
It actually sits under street level and the only thing that signifies that it is there is 4 small gray colored space ships on poles
We literally looked for this place for an hour
When we finally found it, there was a HUGE line outside
We stood in line for atleast 45 minutes and when we finally got to the front of the line we went through this small little ride to get inside
If you're claustrophobic, I don't recommend the ride
The inside is decorated nice but the service is horrible and the prices are rediculous
We sat down at a table and waited atleast 30 minutes and NOBODY waited on us so we got up and left
Needless to say, we'll never go back to that place
Mars 2112 is absolutely miserable
The service is terrible, the food even worse and the prices extremely unworthy
I'm afraid if they turned the lights on everyone including the alien waiters would be scared away
who knows what was living in the carpets
This place is a hoax; it charges a ridiculous amount of money for practically anything you order, given the poor quality of the FB's
Please believe the previous submissions about poor food quality and other disappointments, and not the 10's which have obviously been submitted by 'Mars 2112' friendly people!!
Aside from the ride into the dining area, this attemp at a theme restaurant was a huge disappointment for both of my kids (age 9 13) and my wife and I (kids at heart)
The food was marginal, at best, the table service was a challange and the Spaceman character was annoying
With all the out of work actors in the City you would think they could have found some one better in tune with what he was supposed to be projecting
A Martian Henny Youngman doesn't score with the kids
Just happened on this place
Cute idea, pretty neat dining area
Food mediocre
If you have kids - take them to Disneyworld
The whole concept of Mars 2112 is great
It was fun to go on the ride, except for the scared child behind me
The decorating was well done which helped provide the atmosphere
The food was OK, but not out of this world and the prices were high
They were playing top 40 music the day I went which just didn't work with the whole theme, but they had the trippy sci-fi music playing in the bathroom, so it was almost right
Overall, it was a fun place to go - at least try it once
This place is worth a visit for it's unique atmosphere
Kids would love it especially, but don't come here if you're hungry
The food is horrible and overpriced
OK, so sometimes there's a line to get in
And the food and drinks are terrible and way overpriced
But you don't come here for that
You come here because it's so kitsch
There's a rocket ship theme park ride before you go in
The decor looks like, well, Mars
A giant projection screen plays old sci-fi movies
And the DJ mixes up classic sc-fi soundtracks with techno and ambient
Oh yeah, and some of the staff are dressed as aliens
Fun fun fun
In Short Deep-red banquettes, dim lighting, and pulsating DJ dance music give this bustling bistro a familiarity and comfort level that attracts both downtown Manhattanites and outer-boroughers on their big night out
The menu features familiar bistro cuisine, like steak frites, arugula salad, and various soups
I just spent two weeks in France experiencing the real-deal bistro and I was craving this dining experience since returning to NY
I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered Bar 6 and was so successfully whisked back to Paris that I felt compelled to write a review: the bustling waiters, warm yellow light, and whimsical writing on the mirrors, is straight from Montmartre
The authentic bistro fare (fresh nicoise salads, steak au poivre, moules-frites [mussels fries] and even my favorite late afternoon snack, the croque-monsieur!) with some Morrocan contributions makes for a diverse menu that should please any diner--
I came across this restaurant by chance, and I was nicely surprised
The atmosphere was really nice and relaxed, the food good and the service was ok
I recommend this casual and romantic place for a quiet evening and some cheese and wine!
I have never had a problem with the service here
Waitstaff is competent
I have been here approximately six times
The food is excellent and it is a value that is hard to find in Manhattan
The sandwiches and burgers are excellent
So is the humus
Try the cheese and cold cut platter, about about $10 it's a steal
Fun and noisy local restaurant
The food ranges from okay to delicious and the service varies from great to poor
But it's the atmosphere that makes me return to Bar 6
The crowd is very downtown casual and it's fun to watch the locals
I go here after work a lot and its a nice place to just sit and grab some wine at the bar
Also, have gone with large groups as well and have been seated promptly
Wait staff kinda makes you hunt for them if you need something
Reasonably priced
I think the management needs to do a better job of remembering who they have carded before
like about 7 times
An old school experience that is a must try
I echo the other reviews here regarding the attentive service, comforting feel, and wonderful food
Gianni's a great host
We have been going to Gianni's for a few years - along with so many other Italian restaurants in NYC
Gianni's is consistently terrific
The food is as good - I think better - than any other upscale Italain spot in Manhattan
The owner treats you well, you are never rushed and, he will make anything for you that you can think of
Although the restaurant has been around for some time, there is a reason for that
If you want great Italian food in a relaxing upscale setting you will find no better
A true new york italian restaurant experience

In the end several peoples coats were stolen from their tables
The manager said this wasnt the first time so it seems like this is a recurring problem
Take it for what its worth -- if you decide to go dancing there be careful
I've been going to GyG's for 10 years, it's better than ever
Although the food is only so-so, and the service can be iffy, I still always know I'm going to have a great time when I'm heading there
Bartender's Joey and Evan are two of the best in the world, they always hook it up and look out for you
Thanks for keepin it real for all these years!!!!
This place has only average Mexican food, but it's not the reason to come here anyway
The pretty and fun atmosphere and decor inside the place is the reason, and the trendy and bustling, yet not obnoxious or loud space within
Bit pricey due to location
Good for groups and after work
I am pretty sure no one needs a good review in order to visit GyG's! This is THE place and it has been for years!!! Mexican decor and food
All kinds of drinks
and all this for an inexpensive buck! Well maybe not THAT cheap
But its all worth it! They play all kinds of music; you name it they play it! Live music is usually hispanic bands
Great for groups, or just a few friends or just you and your significant other
This place is an absolute must!!!
This place is hot! Thursday thru Friday nights its packed for live salsa and great djs
The bar is huge and the bartenders and servers are so friendly and always in a great mood
When I walked in I felt so full of energy maybe cause the place is so cool
On top of all that they don't charge a cover
What a great place! Great food and some of the best live Salsa I've heard in the city
Bring your dancing shoes because this place rocks and rolls after dinner hours
A must visit, I'm thinking of making it a frequent stop
This is the place to be! Great food, awsome Margaritas, wondeful bar scene, and the best live salsa merengue bands on Thursday-Sunday nights
I am now a regular
I'm not sure which restaurant the vituperative reviewer before me was at
This place is conveniently located and has exactly the kind of food you'd think it would--Americanized Mexican, not terrifically different from a Chili's
That's not meant as an insult
The place delivers just what it promises: a decent though not adventurous meal close to the trains, lower B'way shopping, and a couple of theaters
This isn't a place you go for a transcendant culinary experience and it doesn't claim to be
I found the staff reasonably attentive, and they brought snacks quickly for my two-year-old (very important!)
I don't know why anyone would rate the food and service above a three
Most likely they are rating the nightlife and the music, which can be fun
The service is horribly slow and inattentive and the food is mediocre at best
And they overcharge you for this lousy treatment! It took me and my buddy 15 minutes to get a drink at the damn bar, and it wasn't even busy
Waiters at this place, if you are reading this, refill the damn water, ask people if they need anything at least a few times (not zero) during the course of the meal, get the orders right, and don't come back ten minutes after we made our order to confirm what we ordered because you forgot to write it down
The bright carnival lights and crappy club music that blared throughout the restaurant probably didn't help
G and G is definitely worth going to
Make sure you get there early (before 10) if you want to eat because you don't want to miss the action
A good mix of people (not a typical spanish restaurant)
Average service, decent food Mexican Cuisine
Long bar
great tequila's live acts who tend to rock the house with great latin music
Show your date you have a little Latin Lover in you
The Scene Opened in 1897 at 53 Spring St
, just down the street from its present location, Lombardi's is easily one of the city's oldest eateries
Now, since taking over the space next door, the restaurant has almost doubled its former size
And while the original half--with its well-worn booths and open kitchen--easily out-charms the new dining room, the famously long wait has been cut in half, and thanks to the addition of a bar, it's almost a pleasure
The Food The reason to come here is obvious: beautiful, smoky crusted pizza with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella
The genius of this pizza starts with the crust, which is black and crispy on the underside (with pleasant, slightly bitter overtones), but gives way to a wonderfully soft, yeasty interior
Signature toppings like double-cut pepperoni and homemade meatballs, along with the restaurant's famous clam pie, keep locals and tourists alike coming back
I just wanted to tell you that is was the best pizza I have ever eaten
The restraunt was beautiful inside
The service was also great
I just wanted to commend you on your excellent food and service
Keep up the great work
Fortuanately, Dad married and Itallian lady, so homemade pizza was as normal as fresh anchovies
Throw in home made sausage made with wine, squid, snales with a fancy name and you got the picture
We ate alot of Sicilian type pies also, so the thin crust at Lombardi's was OK, blackened a bit on the bottom
I'm used to golf ball sized meatballs so these were OK, a bit salty, not quite enough cheese inside, but that's OK too
Making pies is an individual thing, like an artist at work, so the beauty is in the beholder
and every pie maker is unique, and to me wonderful
I really enjoyed the warm atmosphere, it's definitely a great night out
The atmosphere is casual and but sophisticated
There is alot of history at this place, but it's super hip! It's a really lively place and a great romantic atmosphere as well
The original pizza is awesome! It is sooo good, my mouth is watering! I've never had a pizza quite like this before
the service is quick and friendly and the Italian soda is really good too! You have to try this place out! Especially if you like Pizza
but if you've never had any this is a good place to try it out too!
I found this restaurant on Citysearch
What a fabulous place
My fiance and I ordered a small with sausage and mushrooms
The pizza had a very thin crust (which I prefer), that was slightly blackened in parts on the bottom, giving it a really wonderful flavor
The sausage was sliced and flavorful, not at all greasy
The mushrooms came in generous slices
The cheese, instead of mixed throughout the pizza, was in fresh warm gooey blobs, complimented by shredded basil
I easily could have had more but the small suited two people just fine
Two small warnings: cash only, and no free refills
With the quality of this pizza, it's worth it
Living in Finland (Europe), is not the easiest things to do
In my work I visit NYC a couple of times a year and most of the time I spend in Jersey City
Still, there is nothing that can beat Lombardis Pizza, it is even worth driving there with a town car
The best pizza I ever tried and the wild mushrooms together with their own tomato suace made many of my days
I highly recomend this place, great food and most important THE great personal service! I will soon be back, even if my name is Pontus J
Back!  ONE OF THE I HAVE TO GOW THERE WHEN I VISIT NYC!!!!
The spot is bustling, the pizza doughy and crispy in all of the right places
The drinks are ice cold and even the table wine is good
It's a cute, fun date spot that won't break your bank account
There is no question this place is a NYC landmark worth visiting time and again
First trip to New York---Had to try Lombardis we got a large pizza with olives mushrooms and pepperoni
It was the best pizza we had ever eaten and at a great price
We will be back next time we go the city only downside is they only accept cash no credit cards
My dad saw your restaurant on FoodTV and when I told him I was going to NYC, he said make sure to try Lombardi's Pizza so I got on the site and remembered that I too saw it on TV
I cannot rave enough about this pizza, it is fresh, the crust is so awesome and flavorful
The sauce tastes like what italian pizza sauce should
And then the cheese, fresh and delicious
I cannot wait to go back and I also have been craving it ever since
I am so very glad that I took the time to find it and will never forget my experience
I know that next time I travel to NYC, I will not only eat there but I will take it back to my room for breakfast
Thanks, Lombardis

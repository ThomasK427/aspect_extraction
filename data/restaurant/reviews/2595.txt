We went to Firebird on a company function (pre-theater)and we were excited to try it
Upon arrival we were impressed by the decor and character of the beatiful building
Drinks were great, but service was slow and food very disappointing
Had we been able to choose from the regular menu, it may have been better, but overall the food was pretty bad and service mediocre
I think Firebird has fell victim to its own success and is need of some revamping
I have only been to Firebird once and would definitely go back but only for a special occasion
The place is absolutely gorgeous with all of the Russian antiques and the service was great
The food was very good (not spectacular) but slightly overpriced for what you are given
I guess it is a RR place so the prices are to be expected but all in all, it was a very enjoyable experience
It was a bit too quiet for my taste but that is just me
You MUST try a flute of the honey vodka
Words just cannot describe
Ambience great-harp player added a nice touch
Ran out of 2 desserts, but iced honey vodka in crystal flutes a nice touch
We had the tasting with the wine pairing and the first five courses were very good, especially the blini (pancakes with creme fraiche and caviar)
The wine selections were very well matched to the dishes but I thought that the last two courses, lamb with a salty sauce and dessert, were quite mediocre
This place is a solid special occasion choice
The food was decent
The ambience was interesting
The service was mediocre
The price was ridiculous
Entrees are normally in the mid 30's, appetizers are normally in the mid teens
I felt the entrees were in the $20 quality and the appetizers were in the $7 quality
This Restaurant Row place is for tourist
I will not go back there because it is so overvalued
You can't beat the $39 three course prix-fixe (available from 5:30 to close)
The space is gorgeous and quiet
And it's pretty versatile
I'd as easily take my parents as I would a date
FireBird is the hidden of the restaurant district
There are no words to describe the feeling you get as you walk into the restaurant
had dinner there last night, max the waiter was great
nice to know there are still young people out there who are so professional
Caviar service was great as was the duck
Will be back soon
I was really disappointed with the food
Having lived in Russia for 14 years, I have never seen blini as small and cold as they were served at this restaurant
I even asked the waiter if blini were coming later when he pointed to my plate
I have to say, that service was really nice, although all of the waiters looked like they were in mourning
Everything was very odd, and definitely very far from russian
The decor and service were generally outstanding
The creative and upscale presentation of typically-blander Russian food was enjoyable
Perhaps a bit pricier than the food really deserved when you really look at it, but not surprising given its location
Great recommendation for pre-theater dinner
Missing the Russian Tea Room, I was recommended, by some friends, to come, and it was a very nice surprise to find an excellent cuisine and great service
food, service,atmosphere delightful
friendly knowledgeable waitstaff, take a date and enjoy!
For a special night out, this is the spot! We were treated royally
Don't skip the caviar
It's not necessary to order the beluga
The experience is the treat and as a main course, the halibut was superb
Everything was
Love the decadent upstairs bar and the over the top furnishings throughout!
Our experience at the FireBird is something that we will treasure for a long time
When we first arrived, we were pleasantly greeted as if we were regular guests
The dcor in the restaurant is amazing
Its Grande, and at the same time very cozy
Our waiter was more than helpful
He gave us detailed information on the different vodkas, caviars and everything on the menu
The service was splendid, the European way
The food was suburb, nicely plated and hot
A very nice gesture came with dessert, because it was my birthday (the waiter must have overheard it), so on the dessert plate was written Happy Birthday in chocolate
This was a very nice touch
Also the pastry chef deserves a place in history, it was sublime
And we ended our meal with their home-made (yummy) honey vodka
Thank you FireBird

Very pleasant meal
Went for lunch, and got the lunch special of a soup (Corn chowder, very good), an entree (several to choose from) and a dessert
All excellent, and a great bargain
Perhaps the best combination of quality food and service for the price of all the restaurants we visited during our stay
We walked in for lunch, but I would imagine evening would have been tougher
I took my wife to dinner the other night at the Firebird, it was Great
I really felt like i was in house and not a restautant, the whole place just makes you feel welcomed
The food and service were great, not to fast and not to stuffy

Undoubtedly, one of the prettiest places in the city! But, beyond the look is a restaurant that is OK at best and comes up short
The dishes we had, a Broscht Special, Chicken Kiev and Steak were all pretty run-of-the-mill
And, the prices??? Way too high for what the meal was


All of this shouldn't be too surprising because, after all, this is a Theatre District spot and typical of most of them


close by the theatres, marginal food and a little too pricey for what they offer
Claudio's is the tastiest slice! And the service is homey and open late
I have never experienced worse service in New York
I had to ask three times for water and they never refilled my water or coffee
The waiter just slapped my food down and then never returned until he slapped my check down
While I was trying to get my money together, the cashier started taking it out of my hand
The food was terrible
How difficult is it to screw up a waffle? The waffle was lukewarm, the butter was hard as a rock and impossible to spread, and the maple syrup was cold
The coffee tasted funky
The phone had an incredibly loud ring and rang off the hook
It was awful; I left ten cents for tip
We went in March'03 on Sunday - the food was just so-so, but we had to beg for a glass of water (and never got it anyway), but the worst part - the forks and knives were totally dirty (you could see someone's scrambled eggs on them)
The next set was just a little bit cleaner
So - we ate with our hands instead (thanks God it was hamburger and fries)

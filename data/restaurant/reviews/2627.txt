The food here is always ready for you, especially if you are in a hurry
The drinks keep you smiling and you can't get enough
Good food quick service
The price is very reasonable as well
I tried Virgil's once, and now I go every time I visit NYC
The food is always hot and fresh, and the service is fabulous
My advice is to go with another person, the two of you can share the same plate and still have some to take home
I cannot visit NYC without a trip to Virgil's for the best pulled pork sandwich in the Northeast! Do not miss it! Match it with an ice-cold Rolling Rock, and you're in pig heaven!! Yum!
This was the first BBQ restaurant I've ever been to so I don't have much to comapre it to
The food was great, the service fast and friendly and the atmoshere upbeat and fun
My wife and I go to this place once a year (past 3 years) after going to a show
On 12/17/02 @ 5:00 pm, I ordered a bottle of soda, the waiter brought me a glass with no ice! The po pig out was served warm to cold
The ribs were very dry and salty
However, the french fries with brown gravy and apple pie was very good
My quess is that they don't like it if you share the meal with two people
(They give you a lot of food)
On our next visit to NYC, we will go to Dallas BBQ around the corner
When I was living in NYC, my friends and I liked nothing more than dining at Virgils
At peak dining hours you'll spend sometime waiting for a table in the crowded bar area, but once seated, the service is always friendly and prompt
For the price you pay, Virgils offers an outstanding value
They pile on the meat and don't skimp on your side dishes
A great place to go with a group, it's fun to share their wonderul starter dishes like Hush Puppies, BBQ Wings or BBQ Nachos
Entrees are huge, hot and delicious (And there are plenty of things for non-meat or non-BBQ lovers to sample)
If you manage to save room for dessert, you won't be dissapointed either
The menu is complimented by a huge beer selection and a full bar
Your dinner is always topped off with a nice hot towel and a very full stomach
First experience was take out, probably the wrong move
You could tell the food had probably been tasty, unfortunately it arrived cold and soggy
I guess if you are going to try it, go to the joint in person
This is a cool place, food is real good, service is decent (good at times)
Tables are alittle small and close together so not much privacy but good if you like to listen in on other peoples conversations like my wife does
:) The smoked stuff is great and very good side orders from down south, cheese grits and hush puppies, etc are very good too
Being in the heart of Time Square this place is expensive!!!!!! Alot of tourists too, if that kinda thing bothers you
I haven't been to any of the other top BBQ places in nyc, but that's fine with me
This place is really good!  Every time i've been to Virgil's, it's been at an off hour either in the afternoon or late evening -- so i've never had difficulty getting a table
I'd imagine it's a lot more difficult during lunch/dinner hours
Although none of the menu prices are expensive considering the quantity and quality, i'd say that the best value can probably be had in getting one of their sandwiches -- i
e
the ham or pulled pork
You'll get at least a half a pound (probably more) of their amazing bbq'd meats for about 9 bucks
Definitely highly recommended
Love this place great beer and BBQ what else can you ask for? The Pig Out is a must but its HUGE!!! and the Hushpuppies are better than i had in Tennesee
There were so many items that looked good on the menu that we each ordered something different in order to share all of the excellent BBQ
Very New York experience with a down home flare
Lot's of seating for small and large groups
Terrific location
A must for anyone visiting NY
I WENT TO VIRGIL'S ON NOV
6,2002 AND FOUND THE PLACE AMAZING
CONTRARY TO OTHERS THE SERVICE WAS GREAT, THE FOOD EXCELLENT, THE CHILLI IS LIKE EATING STEW!!!  VIRGIL'S PIG OUT FOR $22
00 WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY, THE BRISKET WAS SO TENDER IT FELL APART, AND THE BEER LIST IS OUTRAGEOUS!!!  DINNER FOR FOUR WITH 4 BEERS,2 SODAS WAS $94
00-WELL WOTRTH THE VISIT!!!!
Virgil's came very highly recommended to me from a family member that frequents Virgil's at least 2 x a month
So I figured why not try it
I was in Times Square on my way to a party at Club Babalu's and I figured stopping at Virgil's to eat first would make sense
I ordered the Beef Brisket and my friend ordered the ribs and the chicken combo ( I wound up eating some of her chicken)
The food was great
My side orders cheese grits and collard greens were unbelievable
You have to try the drinks; the Junebug and the Cremesicle
Virgil's is a must sit, stop and eat spot
The service was excellent, the restaurant is clean and has a trendy southern decor
This was one of the best eating experiences I have ever had at a restaurant
You've gotta go the soul food here is authentic!
The service was terrible
You can get better food from the deli buffet
Virgils Wings are an amazing start - they will make you long form more and stay in your mind for a very long time
The dry rub ribs are know by my friend and me as spiritual ribs  Definately get the hush puppies to start - just plain awesome!
Lunch was reasonably priced (for NYC), friendly atmosphere, good food, and close to the theater district
One of our favorites in mid-town Manhattan for reasonably priced good food
Always crowded which tells you a lot
Virgils has great food, but uses less than capable people to handle deliveries
Do not use these guys for delivering food to customers
it's painful and scary
will the food ever get there
and is it the right amount? Who needs that? They could not even suggest the correct amount of Ribs and Chicken for any given size party
If you are near the place and want to eat there, fine
don't have food delivered
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO GO AND EAT WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS AFTER WORK FOR A FEW DRINKS OR IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CHEAP PLACE TO GO AND EAT BEFORE OR AFTER A MOVIE WHILE ON A DATE ON OF NEW TORKS BEST KEPT SECRETS IT PUTS THE REST TO SHAME
This has to be one of the best BAR-B-QUE's in the city
The staff was curteous and friendly
The service was prompt
The food was very good
They have a variety of hot sauces to try
but fair warning
the SCORNED WOMAN is not for the faint of heart
A little pricey but don't let that deter you
I can't wait to go back
This is simply put, the best barbeque in the city
The food is fantastic, the waiters are friendly, they have a great beer and wine selection, and they can accomodate a large group
The ribs are phenomenal
But don't skip the amazing appetizers (hush puppies and biscuits and gravy are MUSTS!), and save room for dessert!
BBQ wings to die for! Richest, thickest, tastiest Bleu Cheese I've ever had
Lively atmosphere smack in Broadway! Catch a show and stop by Virgil's
It's the best BBQ I've had! Great place for family, friends, fun!
We had a very disappointing visit to Virgil's
The last time we visited, 2 years ago, we swore we would never return
Being in a forgiving mood, we did and lived to regret it
Our waiter was too busy trying to sweet talk a table of young women to provide adequate service to a table of middle-agers
It took 20 minutes before he approached the table- despite our expectant looks- and another 20 before the drinks were delivered
After the food was tossed onto the table, we didn't see him again

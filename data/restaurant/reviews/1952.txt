He loves Benitos and so do I
However, my alliegance is shifting- sounds like a good old fashioned movie
Benito's to me is classic
The food is great and the service is too
If you look like a tourist and act like a tourist, you will be treated like a tourist
If you are from around the way, it shows
And this is how you get treated with RESPECT at Benito's
My dad and I will agree on this, Benito's or Paesano's, you are not going to go wrong
Wong Kee, the best chinese food in New York for the price, is closing on Friday, March 21, 2003
Unbelievable roast pork wonton soup
ridiculously cheap prices, and the friendliest staff
I have been going there for 22 years of my life, and my parents before that
A legend that we all will be sad to see go
Make sure you check it out
This restaurant is clean, they provide great service, the prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly
And most importantly of all, the foot is great
I reccomend this restaurant to anyone
I especially reccomend the sizzling platters, and the roast pork fried rice
the seating is minimual in this place, but the finger food is good
especially the salads and the sweets
the rasberry brownies are fresh and big
the ice coffee's here are really good as well
annoyance place a part when there are too many people crowiding around the checkout line and they dont know how to form a line
this happens all the time
the staff is cold at first, but once they see your face a couple of times, they warm up and sometimes will actually remember what you want without asking and offer you a bag for your takeout
that's when you know you have won them over
cute guys
Went there on a Saturday night
My friends and I (a mixed racial group including Indians) were very impressed with the food and decor
The prices are not too bad either
However, watch out for the very pushy head-waiter
What is better on a cold NYC Monday night than some spicy and delicious indian food
This is COMFORT FOOD! I have seen that some people have said the service is bad, but the food is great
I have only ordered in from seamlessweb so I can only say the food is amazing (my favorite is samosa appitizer) I am sitting here waiting for my food to arrive
l It comes promptly and in good shape
I would recommend this food for anyone, even if you have never tried indian food before
As a vegetarian I am very pleased with the selection too!
Alright Guys
Finally a place to sit and eat and miss home sweet home
Salaam Bombay is a great place to eat Indian food
The service is good and the food is awesome
Good quality and fabolous eating place
The spicy lovely food will really remind you of your home and u'll certainly like it
The lunch buffet i had here was good and i liked it
It's a nice romantic place and the ambience is certainly good too
Overall recommended for eating out good Indian stuff
Oh yes it's not expensive too
just few 14 bucks for a nice lunch buffet
Enjoy eating
love Newyork
I've eaten at this restaurant 3 or 4 times now and I must say that the service ruins the experience every time
The food is excellent, as other reviewers have stated, but it's hard to enjoy it when the staff is so consistently rude and brusque
I brought a few friends there last week, and now I will never go back
The server rolled his eyes when we ordered only an entree per person (with no appetizers), spoke curtly to us, and ignored our requests for more water etc
-- it was extremely embarrassing
Overall, I would not recommend this place
I absolutely love Salaam Bombay
As other reviewers have stated, my Indian friend loves it, too!  My first visit was over 5 years ago -- and my last visit was for my birthday last month
All invitees were hesitant due to the price -- but they were easily entranced with the place upon first bite!  It's true, I found the service a bit off -- but I wasn't appalled by it
I'm so used to having such attentive service, that when they reluctant to be so, I found it to be more amusing than anything else
I think each one of my 12 invitees will be revisiting this delectable dining establishment in the future
While the food is excellent, the service is appalling
Even for New York, the staff is extremely curt and rude
It's a shame, because the food really is marvelous, but in the end you're better off going to a less hostile place
Absolutely great everytime
Vikas Khanna has been consistently good at work
Extremely friendly atmosphere
Just do not skip this place on the first impression
The food will make you ignore everything
Worth visiting Tribeca just to eat here
Definitely a good place to eat, if you do not mind the attitude of the serving staff and the premium price
Given a choice, I would pick Baluchi (two blocks down)
One of the best meals of my life! I have never had Indian before this and it was wonderful! Don't go by your first impression, after sitting down for a few mintues the Indian culture was sensational, with lovely sounds from the sitar player
The service was magnificent; the waiter picked out something he thought i'd like and the food was amazing! For dessert he brought complimentary ice cream which was made of rose petals, in a bowl made of ice, with rose petals frozen into the bowl! Try it! You can't get much better than this! I have absolutely no complaints!
Romantic setting, good food, pleasant service
One of the best places to take your date in downtown
Not to mention the value
You get a great night out for about for what you would expect to pay say at Fridays or Applebees
I've eaten here many times and I've never been disappointed
I have several Indian friends who entertain here as well, and we're always torn between here and Namaskaar, in Soho
There is one BIG problem they have
if you order take-out they always forget something, and it usually takes forever to deliver
I eat here about twice a month and the food is always excellent
They have a great sitar player on weekend nights too!
SB has very good indian food
Anything off the tandoori grill is perfectly done
The chicken tikka masala is incredible
I also like dal and mateer paneer
Skip the aloo gobi (super greasy)
Go for the buffet
That way you can avoid the horrid service
You better spend a certain amount of money or the waitstaff will ignore you
I've eaten at SB well over a 10 times
Trust me
To sum it all up
these restauranteurs are looking to serve to only a particular genre of people (those with money) and certainly gave the impression that they don't need or want my business! Don't waste your time or hard earned money here
We eat Indian food in various parts of Manhattan and this is surely the downtown favorite
It's never filled, so we know we'll get in and we can depend on high-quality food
Tandoori dishes are excellent, breads are outstanding, sauces are nicely done and service is attentive
I particularly enjoy the buffet lunch here

This Vietnamese newcomer, and only Vietnamese restaurant in the area, dishes out delicacies (from the entrees to Bill Yosses celebrated desserts)
No wonder both the New York Times and New Yorker magazine give it top ratings
The ambience is pleasing even though it can get cramped during peak times
I'm sorry, but the prices at Boi are outrageous for this type of cuisine
You would literally pay 1/3 of the price for the same quality (or even better) of food served in NY's notorious Chinatown
Pho will set you back $12 when indeed you can find the same bigger portion of soup for $4
The more expensive entrees were priced $19 and up
Save your money and go to C-town or Bao Noodles instead
Boi will never see a repeat customer with these prices
Also, the service was slow and erratic, perhaps b/c they just opened
However, the ambience was pleasing
This new place has a nice decor, but it is a little cramped
The service was good as they gave me a complimentary drink, but was a little unsure of the dishes
I don't think they had anyone there who was vietnamese
The shrimp rolls for appetizer was bland
The crepes with shrimp and sausage was ok, but you had to eat it witha fork
Tapioca dessert was very bland, however the flan was good
Theoir specialty drink with some type of vietnamese fruit was good
Prices too high
The Scene Those not buzzing after the walk through the glowing Mandarin Oriental Hotel lobby will feel the magic once inside the restaurant, where wall-to-wall windows show off a magnificent view of city lights and Central Park
Dressed in subtle earth tones and soft fabrics, the dining room is sophisticated, luxurious and bi-level, ensuring almost all tables a view
Service is impeccable--particularly the approachable, knowledgeable sommelier, Annie Turso
The Food Begin with seared scallops served atop smooth, buttery celeriac puree and surrounded by truffle consomme, or the layered foie gras and venison terrine--a clever pairing that tames the richness of the foie
The shining star among entrees is the Kobe-style filet of beef in a silken, oxtail sauce, but the suckling pig with pig cheek confit is also good
End the meal with the excellent chocolate fondant served with a fascinating fromage blanc sorbet; the deconstructed parfait is unsatisfying
The waiter spent a long time telling us about the menu (and more about his own life history in the process
talk about big ego!) We eat out a lot at great restaurants and I can safely tell you the food was very, very average
The prawn appetizer was too spicy and looked like a $5 parwn curry at an Indian restuarant
Avoid the seabass---way too salty even for a salt fiend like me
My friend's lamb was too well done
we returned it
By the time it got back, everyone else had finished their food
The desserts were interesting to look at but tasted ordinary
The view is great so it is a nice place to take someone you want to impress but don't go for the food
I just had dinner at Asiate tonight and am so disgusted I am staying up to write this review
First, it's fixed price only at $75 -- which is not a problem as long as this elegant restaurant with a very attentively-trained staff could actual EXECUTE its food prep and plating sufficiently
Both my seared foie gras appetizer and 5-spiced duck entree were COLD -- and the entree (duck) was sloppy in its plating! And if that wasn't bad enough, I was charged $41 to 2 glasses of wine with my meal
In total including tax and tip the bill was a disappointing $145 (and that's just for 1 person)
I won't soon be forgetting my dining experience here
We came for my father's 50th Birthday and our party of 6 ended up with a total bill (tip included) of nearly $750
Needless to say, at ~ $125 per person, it's not a place you go every day, but rather only on a special occasions
The view is perfect for a romantic evening with your partner or an upscale family affiar
The pre-fix menu with wine pairing (highly recommended) is a slow and exciting way to make the evening pass as the waiters dance around you and bring each exciting new dish
Everything that entered my mouth was nothing short of astonishing
Reservations are hard to aquire, so book far in advance, and be prepaired for a memorable evening
Made reservations for two and were seated promptly upon arrival
The space is impressive with its glass wine display, and floor to ceiling vista
The presentation was clever, and the food tasty however the service that accompanied it was so slow it made us feel neglected
The sommelier on the other hand was quite knowledgeable asking each of us what we had chosen for entrees before recommending an appropriate wine
Chances of returning are slim unless paying with a corporate card
I just returned from dinner at Asiate
Have I had better meals? Of course
But this was outstanding
I read the reviews of others here, who seem to have ordered from the menu, rather than trying the tasting menu
Wow
The winter tasting menu with wine pairings is amazing
We enjoyed a leisurely 2
5 hour meal -- impeccable service, polite, not a an ounce of pretention, only professionalism
The second course of the tasting menu
wow! It alone was worth the price
The only not so tasty element - the slightly dry pressed duck, in the third course
Excellent job, reasonably priced for a menu of this type, with excellent service -- not at all what I read here
Yeah, the view was nice, the food equal to it
how dare they call this tourist trap a french japanese restaurant? everything takes like it was mocrowaved in an airplane and served up by crass, rude, nasty, and snobby waiters who don't seem to speak any western language at all -- what a truly vile waste of money -- yes, there is a nice view but you can get the same view at vastly cheaper prices on almost any tourist trip of manhattan -- who needs this pretentious, awful, snobby, ghastly place to bilk you our of your well-earned dollars -- this place should be strictly boycotted until it hires some polite staff, from the maitre d' on down, and hires a chef who is better than the ptomaine city specials they are currently sevring up -- to be missed on all accounts --
This is a great place to go when you want to be somewhere really nice with excellent service and a fabulous view
The only problem is that the food was good rather than spectacular, which is what I'd like to expect from a place this 'nice
' It might just be that we ordered the weakest contender, rack of lamb
It seems like the chef is creative, but not enough to pull the food from good to wow
Last ones to arrive and leave restaurant
Appetizers great, and we had reisling under $100 recommended by the waiter
Chic atmosphere
View was unclear due to rain
Would not recommend Asiate if you expect to stimulate taste buds
Main courses we had (beef, lobster sukiyaki, black seabass, striped seabass) tasted too much like homestyle authentic Chinese food except for the sukiyaki
The black seabass is served steamed with ginger flavoring; it's tasty but you can find this at chinese seafood restaurants
If you don't mind eating authentic asian food in a modern setting, then Asiate is fine
At the end of the night, our waiter brought an extra dessert (passion fruit brulee) for the group
DON'T GET PASSION FRUIT DESERT, IT'S LIKE EATING LOTION, but YOU MUST GET CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE
BOTH DESERTS WERE COMPLIMENTARY
I think it was because we had four ppl and took his recommendation for the wine
go here if you're looking for a beautiful setting and 5 star service
But if you are looking for food that melts in your mouth
this place isn't that
For $75 pre-fixe, I would've expected dessert to be included, a little something to clean the palette and some pettifores
it was a nice experience, but i would recommend drinks in the lounge
you get the same beautiful views, but a large selection of wines
I went here on my two year anniversary with my boyfriend
The views are amazing, the decor is exquisite, The service is impeccable
However, the food is average and very pricey
You are paying for the view, the ambience and the service
It was a great experience but I probably won't return
This place is great for a romantic evening or a business lunch
It has a wonderful view since it is on a really high level about 90ty something
The service is wonderful
I went with 6 other friends
It's was a good experience but I don't think it's really for large groups
The food was really good but very pricey and the portions were small
But this is an upscale restaurant so that would be pretty much given
I had friends visiting for a birthday we chose Asiate for brunch
Everything was phenomenal

We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it
So rude
Yes, the service is really that bad
The wanna be model wait staff are not exactly shining stars at what they do so if you go there, you'll have to deal
But staff aside, it's a great place for an afternoon drink
Went on a sunny Sunday and although the DJ was playing music way too loud for a normal conversation, you can scoot in w/ your party and shout
Felt like I was in Capri for a minute w/ the open doors and Euro feel
Recommend having a buzz on if you check this place out so as not be annoyed by the waitstaff
I went to meet friends for happy hour the other day and the service was soooo horrible and blatantly rude that we left - the first time I have ever left a place because of the service - and it was not just me - there were at least 5-7 of us all standing around this small bar trying to get a drink for 30 minutes or more - the bartender would look at me (or others) and we would say what we wanted- and then for fun - he wouldnt make it - it was almost comical - except that was soo blatantly rude
By far the worst restaurant/bar in the city that I have been too - and Ive been to lots of bars and restaurants in the city
This place isn't all bad: the music is good and the locaiton is fun
The service/management leaves much to be desired, however
They have the attitude that you are lucky to be served by them
Last time I was there, a very high-strung man kicked us off of our table since he said we'd been there too long--meanwhile two out of three of us weren't finished yet
We probably would have happily paid and left had he been congenial about it, but he was oddly-confrontational from the outset
Bottom line: If you want to pay absurd prices for horrible service and mediocre (over-salted) food, this is where you should go
Good place for a late emergency bite
Not a bad place to stop by for a quick bite at 2AM, when all other restaurants in Soho are already closed
I loved dining at Cafe Noir
Although the service is lacking, everything else was so great that it didn't really bother me
I went with two friends and we ordered a bunch of Tapas, all of which were amazing
The shrimp cigar, avocado hummus, beet salad and spanish quesadilla were all amazing
The atmosphere is great as well and it feels like you are dinig in Spain
The whole experience was a lot of fun and I will definitely be going back
I've eaten here on several occasions
The service , food and staff is great
It's great to bring a first date or a group of friends
The atmosphere is lively with great music in the background
Highly recommend it!
Went to this place as a fallout from Naked Lunch's long line
and thought maybe I could find a good time across the street
Very, very wrong
Our party was assaulted by the manager after a discrepancy with the bill
He hooted and hollered -- and told every staff person at the bar, not to serve us
He then preceded to give us the evil eye until we were so uncomfortable we were forced to leave
Very unprofessional
I'll never return
Cafe Noir has a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends, having a party, and having a great time! Drinks are great, especially sangria
Food is also quite good, gotta try the pizza appetizer
Very good happy hour/fall back place
The steak with fries is great, and I love dipping bread on olive oil w/ balsamic vinegar
lots of sexy elements
Some people here are rather arrogant but it perfectly captures the neighborhood's spirit
Hard to get a table
great atmosphere
The paella isn't impressive but do try their tapas degustation platter
Tried to find a place with good food, prices fit for a grad student, and fun! While those places are few are far between, Cafe Noir has something for everyone, and all at deliciously reasonable prices
Everything we ordered was yummy, and we all left there satified
Good for groups, and fun!
Took some friends for lunch and we all agree that it's been a long time since we've been this impressed with a restaraunt
The food is great, the portions are healthy, the price is right, the staff is friendly and I especially like the hassle free helping of three baskets of delicious bread accompanied by a superb garlic oil for dipping
Hey all you silly billies out there! Ok, can i just tell you something? Cafe Noir is definately not the most shi shi place in New York, but nestled near the Holland Tunnel is a surprise gem! At first, I seriously thought my boyfriend was taking me to some cheap spanish/morrocan bungalow and get served chicken and potatoes, Pooooooh
Horr-rri-ble! Well, the service was awesome
I asked for the waitress' recommendation (as always) and she recommended the glass of water with ice over the plain glass of water
That was soooo helpful! Well, once again I was unable to finish the paella and ended up taking it home ( I filled up on delicious fried brie and duck)- Meow Meow
Hehe, I've just been looking for new, cute places to go to
I will definately go again sometime I say! Bye silly billies!!! No! yoouuuu Shush!
Unique atmosphere and pretty good food
Great for a romantic dinner or with a group of close friends!
The best sangria I've ever had, hands down
Also, excellent food
tender grilled calamari, shrimp with spinach in puff pastry, delicious fried brie
A little pricey, but worth it! Somewhat crowded, loud and smoky, though
The Scene Casual, loud and generally approachable, this chain brewery is a safe bet for groups and out-of-towners
Colorful paintings and exposed brick give the space a homey charm; ample private party space is a boone for company get togethers and birthday celebrations
The Draw The menu offers the usual pub assortment of nachos, quesadillas, burgers, ribs and pasta dishes
Most are fine if not particularly dazzling
The rotating list of beers is the real draw
At any given time there are five house beers to choose from, including a lager, a red ale and an oatmeal stout, as well as two or three seasonal brews
Waited forever for service and barely got a grunt, no smile, from him
We sat in a small booth near the bathrooms (just in case he wants to know that I'm talking about HIM!)
He brought the bill and dropped it on our table while he was facing another table
No thank you
Nothing
Should have left the same thing for his tip
Food was mediocre for the cost
It is convenient but so are some other chain restaurants
I've ended up here a few times because its location is easy to remember and to get to, but every time I go I remember that I didn't really like it the previous time
The food is kind of eh, not much of a selection and the service was really slow last week
There was almost no one there on a Friday night which should have been a clue
This was the worst dining experience I've ever had
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around)
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check
My turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw
Horrible food and Horrible service
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY
ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center)
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city
This place is worth going even if only for their beer
The seasonal beers are fabulous!! Try the pumpkin ale in the fall
it's my favorite
For about ten bucks, you can get a really big, juicy burger with all the fixings with an ample amount of fries
The pumpkin ale is worth trying too
A cheap, guilty pleasure
Yes its a chain, but the service has been good on every visit, great sandwiches and salads most surprising are the excellent deserts
The Union Sq location is probably the most comfortable and most filled with locals, but Chophouse in Times Sq is a nicer dinner setting
Not bad at all

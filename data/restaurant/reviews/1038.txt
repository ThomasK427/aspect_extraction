Thank you Casa for making my night a memorable one:)
I went to this restaurant with 5 people
Let me just begin by saying that the theme of the night was We ran out of that
For the main course there was no meat dishes to choose from because they ran out of filet mignon and lamb chops
They ran out of crab
And they ran out of coffee! Coffee! Now I'm a tolerant person, but by this time I was so dissappointed and the waiter could see it on my face, so he sent over the manager
She then explained the arduous process of making coffee and suggested tea
How insulting
She then sent over the owner, and his only recourse was to give us a free bottle of sparkling wine
What a joke!
I definitely recommend Casa North
Food was excellent and plentiful, Drinks were strong, Service was prompt and attentive, Ambience was exciting and different
We were seated as soon as we arrived for our reservation
The belly-dancer was great!! And the hukkah is a must-have!!!! Although the visit was very expensive it was well worth it!!! Great for a Birthday get-together!
NY has lots of places w/ bad/spotty service but I've never been more appalled
Waited forever for table (w/ a res
); got 5 course prix fixe meal for table (courses 12 are bread soup); waited forever b/t apps
entrees
Asked many times told food would be right out, finally were told that there was a situation in the kitchen
We cancelled our meals--food arrived 2 seconds after
We asked for the check as we ate (never had course 5) then the mgr
came over had the audacity to tell us that we were unreasonable wanting to just pay leave! Told us that we should expect a 5 course meal to take 90 mins
--we had been there for almost 3 hrs
--then comped us all of $5/person said we should call him directly next time for our reservation! Next time? We'll never go back there
went with my boyfriend, got the tent for two
food was great (there is ALOT of it), belly dancer was fun
I don't recommmend the prawns, but the red snapper was fab
didn't care for the dessert (some kind of cake), but I was so stuffed by then I didn't mind
I went there for a special occasion and reserved a tent for two
I thought the food, service and ambience was excellent
It was extremely romantic!
We went here for a friend's girlfriend's birthday
The friend happens to be Egyptian
He loves this place and now I do as well
I had the shrimp and we triend many of the appetizers
Everything was wonderful including the my favorite course
the bellydancer
Super romantic
Service was so helpful and kind
I certainly will return
Love this restaurant! The food was amazing, the service attentive and helpful (they were very careful about my food allergies), and the atmosphere is beautiful
Looking forward to going back
If you DON'T want to eat, visit this restaurant
I arrived excited for a romantic dinner in a tent
My reservation was for 8:30pm
By nine, I still hadn't been seated and the host didn't seem to care one bit
For some reason, the host kept studing his reservation book, but to no avail
He didn't update me on when I would get a table and several other people who didn't have reservations were taken ahead of me!
The Scene Poodle skirts and Mary Janes would be perfectly appropriate in this lovely little shop, where the brick walls are painted a soft yellow, the wallpaper looks like grandma's and everything from the antique ovens to the bottle-green pie dishes is retro bakeshop done just right
Friendly counter help furthers the small-town impression
The Food It's the baking equivalent of shabby-chic: Polka-dots of pink and turquoise frosting turn an otherwise plain yellow cake into something more charming; desserts come in old-fashioned flavors like chocolate cherry
What saves the place from being too cutesy is the fact that everything tastes so good: Icebox cake--made with layers of whipped cream and chocolate wafers--is surprisingly light, and the chilled peanut butter cake topped with chunks of peanut butter cup is just dreamy
As for the cupcakes? The vanilla version with colorful vanilla icing is excellent; the chocolate cake is a bit dry
I keep wanting to give Billy's another chance
After all, I live in the neighborhood, a quick 2 min walk, and it sure is a cute place, but I have finally promised myself never to go back
The cupcakes and cookies and their various cakes and pies are all fine and have satisfied my sweet tooth in the past, but I continue to have bad experiences there with rude staff
I kept thinking my experiences were isolated incidents, but it's simply become routine to be treated shabbily there by clerks behind the counter
Just one recent example: It's not worth it to buy a $25 key lime pie from Billy's, only to have the counterperson cop an attitude because you politely ask if he can give you one of the ones in the refrigerator rather than the display case, because you are going to be travelling for one hour with the thing in July heat
Bottom line is customer service is nonexistent at this overly-hyped establishment
AND
two other options in the immediate neighborhood wins HANDS DOWN for truly awesome sweets and treats, so it's a no-brainer
Try the exceptional Three Tarts at 9th and 20th, or La Bergamote across the street from 3 Tarts
Bye bye Billy
The place is adorable and the peanut butter pie is great, but the cupcakes are disappointing
I tried them twice to be sure of it
The cupcake icing is wonderful, but the actual cake is very dry
Magnolia or Buttercup are much better
If you're already in Chelsea, you might stop by, but its not worth the trip
The red velvet cupcake here is subpar
The frosting is way too buttery and doesnt resemble the traditional cheesecake frosting that is an integral part of a great red velvet cake
The other treats are fine and the bakery itself is adorbale if you can get a seat at one of the two tables
average cupcakes
there are much better to be had in manhattan alone
overall taste is good but flavors are unremarkable, possibly even absent
cake texture is somehow moist but inappropriately crumbly/chalk like -- it falls apart like a good biscuit should when you bite into it
frosting is not much different from that you can buy out of a can
biggest con: the service -- or lack of
they frost c-cakes right there in front of you
when asked for one w/o sprinkles was told they COULD NOT DO IT
whatever
I LOVE THESE CUPCAKES! I will make the trip at 11pm all the way from the UES down the Chelsea so I can satisfy my craving
Cute environment, nice staff who always has a smile on their face, the smell of this place is AMAZING
My recommendation would be more tables so I can eat there for once but the space is tight so they work with what they have
Way better than some of the other well known places in the city
My husband and I had our wedding catered by Billy's
They made a tower of 120 cupcakes and a two-layer cake for us
We ordered half chocolate half vanilla cupcakes and had white butter cream icing on each
It was delicious!! Although I wish they had a delivery service (we needed to pick up the cupcake tower, cupcakes, and return the tower after the wedding), their customer service was excellent and more than made up for that
When we ran into a snag with the restaurant, Billy's was more than accommodating
I suggest this bakery for parties and cupcake craving satisfaction!!
I've been going to Bill'ys with my wife and daughter since day one
We have always been more than satisfied with the lovely atmosphere, darling service and the delectable desserts! I couldn't wish for a better spot in our neighborhood
I reccomend the classic chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream
Also favorites of my family are german chocolate cake, all cookies and the delicious babana cream pie
to die for! This is dessert here people not rocket science
I went back again just to be sure, and although this is a cute place, the cupcakes and cakes are extremely dry and tasteless under the icing
The icing is delicious, but someone should be informed that you need to have good, moist, delicious cake underneath it
Be sure to grab a utensil on your way out, as eating such dry cake is virtually impossible without one
Big dissapointment and really amazed at the press this bakery receives
Magnolia is MUCH better than this copycat bakery

I highly recommend! Along with the unlimited mimosas, I was quite pleased
Atmosphere is nice, and all of  the waiters there were super-nice and friendly too
They did not make me feel self-conscious in the least to be eating there alone! I also loved the great soul music they were playing
I found myself swaying along while eating my breakfast
All in all a great experience all around
Looking forward to returning for dinner with friends next time!
I took my parents to brunch at Essex and everything was wonderful, including the service
The crowd was a true New York mix of hipsters, elderly locals and orchard street tourists that made everyone feel welcome
The bloody marys were strong and plentiful
Everything was good to excellent, especially the onion rolls, the salmon eggs benedict and the blueberry pancakes
And the hot Australian waitress with with the tattooed stomach charmed the pants off my parents!!!
Went to Essex for Saturday Brunch and loved it so much I went back on Sunday
The quality of food and Drink are unmatched for the money
For $12 I got an amazing eggs benedict with three eggs on three English Muffins, Home Fries and, for real, all the bloody maries I could drink
Service was lightning fast and, though the room was packed on Sunday our waitress moved us to the bar where we continued our unlimited bloody maries till closing
I've already made reservations for next Sunday
Went to Essex with a group of 14 for a Birthday dinner and I will be back again
The portions were huge and our waiter was totally cool with setting up a menu of samples and shares
The tuna sushi spring roll alone was worth coming back for
The chipotle pork was not to be missed
The best was that we weren't rushed out after our meal, even though it was a packed Friday night, so we partied until 3 in the morning to a great DJ
The Scene If all the chefs and waitstaff sat down, they'd fill every seat in this classy family-run Japanese stronghold
The customers here aren't messing around: they didn't come this far east for nothing, and most contemplate their food quietly
The three seats at the sushi bar afford the most contact with the solicitous staff
The Food Despite a menu that seems larger than the restaurant, great care goes into the preparation of every dish
The sushi offerings are limited in number, but manage to result in near-infinite permutations of rolls, with the "Fantastic Ama Ebi Roll" topping the charts (crabmeat salad, avocado, flying fish roe, and sweet shrimp)
Gyoza (dumplings) have wonderfully delicate skins, Usuzukuri (thinly sliced fluke with ponzu sauce) offers refreshing acidity, and the restaurant's riff on tuna tartare is emboldened by crunchy bits of puffed rice
This place has excellent sushi
I've been going for months, and I cannot get enough of the food
Head Chef and owner Yoshio can be found at the sushi bar serving up some of his fantastic creations
And I don't think I've ever seen another Japanese restaurant with oysters, and they have em at a great price too
Trust me, go to Yoshi
This is a great place for sushi, especially for people on dates or for people wanting to eat alone at the sushi bar
The food is very good (not the best in town, but still very good)
While the service is only average, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable
I like this non-pretensious so much I go there almost every day
They have lots of tasty foods and waiters are very friendly
If you are looking for a place nice and casual, this restaurant is the best
This is a typical no frills sushi place with awesome oysters and clam soup! The service is very freindly and the quality of rolls is top notch-perfect for a first date! Or casual night!
The raw oysters were really good
The sukiyaki is excellent
The price is very resonable
If you like malaysian food, you'll like Protons! They've got a tasty selection of Malaysian Cuisine at a very affordable price
They also have great bubble drinks for $2!! Great place for a group of 4-8
I'm not sure if it would be a great date place, tho
But that's your call! Enjoy!!
Doesn't look like much, but definitely the best Szechuan food I've found in NYC
Every dish I've tried (I'm partial to spicy chicken dishes) was delicious
A bit oily, but that's par for the course with these types of places
I challenge anyone to beat the quality of this chiense food at this price
I got quick takeout here one evening before hopping on the NYC Chinatown to Boston Chinatown bus
I ordered the pork and scallion dumplings (which were amazing) and the cold sichuan noodles (SPICY!!)
Next time, I think I'll just get the regular cold noodles
I was very impressed with the quality of the food; I will definitely make a point of going here again
If only they had a location here in Boston!
This is the finest Szechuan restaurant in NYC or anywhere (so far as I can tell)
The food packs a wollop and will surprise you and delight you over and over again
So far as the negative review I do not doubt her experience
Everytime I have gone the restaurant was not crowded at all but the Chinese of Chinatown are not renowned for their service and if the staff were overwhelmed I can imagine all Hell breaking loose
Perhaps go earlier on Friday or Saturday nights, but I imagine it is a rare problem because it is not often crowded
If you love Spicy chinese food, this restaurant is for you
I have tried many dishes, and most of them are extremely delicious
Their fish soup, though not spicy, is rich yet delicate
Their DanDan noodle, wonton in hot sauce, hot and spicy beef
are flawless
Highly recommended
The Scene Every night's a bar mitzvah at this Lower East Side landmark eatery
With tacky kitsch as the decor's dominant motif and the obligatory grousing waiters hustling out brick-sized steaks and icy vodka to gussied-up regulars and tourists, an evening at Sammy's is both dinner and street theater
Call ahead to reserve a table, and to find out about the daily Roumanian specials
Knowing what you are getting into helps add to the curiosity
but overall I was happy with the steak, potatoe pancakes and frozen vodka! Our server was amazing
It reminds be of a Jewish Mangia e Bevi
Overall I thought it was fun! The vodka however adds up so lay low on the frozen bottle
Go with an open mind, although I could not eat the liver with fat oil! Yuck
Fun for a celebration
This is also a great place to take your Jewish grandmother
Listen to schmaltzy songs, eat loads of good, artery clogging, Ashkenazi food, and be prepared to drink vodka like a Russian at a wedding
A NYC classic! Like Asti, this is a place that should not be missed (Asti has closed)
This is one of the worst restaurants in New York
It's dirty, unappetizing and unbelievably overpriced
The service is obnoxious (an imitation of the brusque waiters at Luger's - the major difference being that this place doesn't serve edible food), the cuts of meat are as bad as they get, and the atmosphere (which is this restaurant's only redeeming quality) doesn't begin to make up for it
OK I understand its a novelty restaurant and for uptowners it must be cute to come to the LES and slum it for the night
But I say why bother? It has all the ambiance of an unrenovated 20 y/o cheap diner (it scares me to think what the kitchen must look like) and a grouchy staff to match
The menu's are barely readable from what must be one of the oldest copying machines in existance stapled to a manila folder
And thats about as fancy as it gets
The food was good - but who wants to pay $30 for a veal chop with no sides? They claim to have entertainment 7 nights a week but we had none
I give this an overwhelming 2 thumbs way the down
We go here once a year - as a tradition for 8 years now, and have brought a lot of people for whom this place also became as a second home, because that's how you feel when you're there!
I have eaten here several times and it is very consistent
A very enjoyable and nostalgic place
You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy the food, but it sure helps to understand what Sammy's is all about
I have found that the non-jews just don't get it
Are there better steak places? Absolutely, but this place is not just about the steaks
You have to consider the whole package
Overall, Sammy's food is definitely well above average
The chopped liver is to die for
But the best part is arguing about whose Bubbi did it better :-) BTW, make sure you ask for Perry!!!
We were at sammy's roumanian november 2002
It was a great experience
I sked for the wine list and was told they only had two wines, one white and one red

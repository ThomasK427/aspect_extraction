You can ask anyone on the street where to get ice cream and they'll have 11 words for you- Serendipity
Oh and be sure to get the frozen hot chocolate
Frozen hot chocolate
Where else but Serendipity? Exactly
This is one of the best places to eat at in NY
The frozen hot choclate is to die for and the choclate cake is also great
It is such a cute place that you don't mind waiting
We just moved to CA from NY and this is one of the places we miss the most
You know this will be one of our first stops when we return to NY in October
My experience was VERY DISAPPOINTING! Horrible service
After waiting an hour and a half to be seated, we finally sat down for some ice cream
But that is not when the waiting stopped
Once seated, we waited over 15 minutes to even be greeted by a waiter, not even receiving utensils or water
When the waiter finally came to our table, after having to be flagged down, he spoke such broken english that we could not get any information from him
While waiting, we watched the party across from us send a plate back twice because it was prepared wrong
Once the ice cream came, it was mediocre compared to the hype
I can go get a better sweat treat, for better prices, better service, and no wait somewhere else
I am never going back, and DO NOT RECOMMEND this place
Its all hype, and does not deliver
I have been going to Serendipty 3 for years now and it still hasn't lost any appeal to me
Every time I bring a new friend they fall in love with it too
The food is great, the waitstaff is so friendly, the decorations are always fun (especially during the holidays) and NO ONE will ever top their desserts
Go hungry cause trust me you will get more than your fill
Me and my friends go here all the time, we love it
I recommend this place and the wait is worth it
Good place to take visiting relatives
Obviously the frozen hot chocolate is amazing, but the rest of the food is tasty, but overpriced
A must after spending too much money at Bloomingdales
after reading the review and seeing the movie about 5 million times we decided we had to visit serendipity
anywayz the wait was about an hour but overall it was well worth it the frozen hot chocolate was chocolicious and the broadway sunday tickled my taste buds my only suggustion is the dessert is a the size of a three course meal in it self so go with an empty stomach the service and atmosphere was alright but the quality of the food made up for everything on a scale of 1-10 serendipity gets a 29
Definately the place to go for ice cream
I can't comment on the rest of the menu because all I got was desert
The wait is long and it's usually very crowded
I would suggest putting your name down, eating someplace else, then coming back for desert, depending on how long the wait
The portions are huge! Perfect for sharing with someone
The Frozen Hot Chocolate is a must as is the Sunday with Hot Fudge
Frozen hot chocolate
Divine
Chili is fabulous as well
Long wait for tables, but worth it in the end!
My husband and I visited Serendipity 3 for the first time this past weekend
We were in NYC celebrating our 11th Anniversary
I was a little skeptical after reading the mixed reviews on this site, but we still took a chance
Our desserts were fantastic
The frozen hot chocolate was good; but, the Forbidden Broadway Sundae was out of this world
We were told it was an hour wait and ended waiting 45 minutes
The host was very pleasant and our waiter went out of his way to be nice
An enjoyable evening!!!
I've been going there since high school and I'm now 56
It still has the same charm
I love bringing new friends here
Even native NYers who visit the first time love it
Yuck! overpriced desserts
I've had much better ice cream and the frozen hot chocolate tasted like an iced blend of ensure or some other chocolate flavored nutrition drink
Try lalo for real desserts, nobody needs a $15 sundae
Made a reservation for Sat night, was seated within in 5 minutes
Waiter was friendly helpful- food was good, desserts were better!
I could not believe my eyes when I saw the price of their deserts
The portions were pretty big I guess, but still
YIKES!! I still have yet to try their frozen hot chocolate everyone raves about, but I've tried like three or four of their other deserts and they are all only decent
Nothing to take your breath away or anything
Most likely have to wait an hour
but the frozen hot chocolates are sooo worth it on a hot summer afternoon
The inside is really fantastic as well
The price is on the pricey side though
so eat somewhere else and just go straight for the dessert
Yummy is the only word I can think of to describe their famous frozen hot chocolates! The food is hit and miss
My entree was not too shabby while my friend's was just plain unpalatable
The food is somewhat expensive
A friend and I went to Serendipity because we had heard so much about it
Our waiter was actually pretty nice, but then, we are really nice
But the host was kind of a jerk
However, I agree with the one person that said the customers were obnoxious
It was like snobby's day out
We overheard lots of conversations from people sitted around us
It was too yuppie and snobby and people trying to be trendy
Its funny how people trying to be classy end up just acting snobby
anyways, we only had the frozen hot chocolates, which i thought were pretty good
This place drove me insane! The wait was too long
The host too snotty for his own good
I waited for an hour- got there at 12 midnight, got a table at 1
I was famished by then
They stopped serving dinner at 12 midnight! Of course, I didn't want to leave anymore since I waited for an hour to get that table!  Dessert was ok
Nothing extremely special! Servers were polite
But this place is definitely over-rated!
The staff that works at Serendipity need a real reality check
They are the rudest and most pretentious people I have ever been around and they treat their customers as if they are scum
After yelling at my girlfriend for sitting on a side stool, while we waited the hour and half it takes to get an ice cream cone, I decided enough was enough
This waiter also decided that moving our names down on the list would teach us a lesson
This place sucks and the people who work there should realize that they serve ice cream at a place that is the size of my closet and they make $5
00 an hour, it's not exactly the Four Seasons! This review is no exaggeration
Just Fabulous! OK, so it doesn't have a kids menu (they claim the misinformation on this site is not their doing) We stayed anyway, in spite of the hour wait to get in (there's great window shopping on the block) AND GLAD WE DID! There were many (huge) portion choices for us all
The food was very good
The staff was charming and efficient which was remarkable for such a busy place
But I can't understand the impatience of some self appointed elitist customer types
This place is so busy
Our waiter was on top of everything even though he had another large table running him ragged
The staff should be commended for THEIR patience! Well be back!
I've never actually had dinner here, because I wanted to make sure I would have enough room for the stupendous frozen hot chocolate
One is big enough for at least 2 people, so bring a date and share

I'm not exaggerating when I say that the entire staff was impatient and rude
We left and ended up sitting on the steps of church around the corner
To make the experience of the bakery a total dissapointment, the cookies were stale to boot!
Cannoli Schamoli
Try the Lulu! Puff pastry filled with almond cream topped with chocolate
The coffee is exquisite!
Pastries are good but not near as good as some Brooklyn pastry shops
The best cannoli's, pastry selections cakes come from Brooklyn
This is a great place for a nice cheese cake, coffee, or cookies
If your on a diet - stay clear
Irresistible! The cannoilis are the best I've ever had
A very dangerous place
The best canolies in NYC they fill them when you order them
Discovered this on a food tour of Greenwich Village
This is the place the guys on the apprentice on NBC got thier lemonade cups from
The desserts are delicious and adds to the character of NYC
Must visit this place if go to NYC
It is surrounded by many other neighborhood shops serving delicious food
BEST cannolis EVERYDAY!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Good gelato too
I have to say, I have had quite a few cannolis in my time
And I have yet to find one that even comes close to the cannoli's I've had in Sicily
But, I have to say, the cannoli's at Rocco's are the best I have had since then
THE BEST!!!
I've eaten black and white cookies all over the world and by far Rocco's has the BEST! The pastries are delicious but if you had to choose one thing, it's the Black-n-Whites that brings me back year after year
Although the pasteries look and taste great, the service could be a lot better
We were very rudely helped by one of the workers and after we decided to take our stuff to go, we were told to leave
Perhaps it was a miscommunication because we were'nt decided on what we wanted, but the place wasn't busy and I think we're entitled to take a few minutes to decide
Well we wont be going back!
I'd heard great things about Veniero's, after going to Rocco's, I was less than impressed
Rocco's has a great selection, good quality, and friendly service - and, unlike Veniero's, they don't fill your cannoli until you order them
Another plus - it's across the street from John's Pizzeria
What could be a better night out than Manhattan's best pizza, followed up with creamy cannolis from Rocco's?
Everytime we go into the city we make a point of visiting Rocco's to stock up on NYC's best italian pastries
I went in to get some miniature eclairs and asked for a baker's dozen
The girl said it'd be about $7
50
I ended up getting 14 miniature eclairs and one slice of turtle cheesecake for $7
50
Not bad at all! Both were great! I had actually asked the girl to give me a slice of her favorite cheesecake, and she beamed a smile at me
I asked which was her favorite and she said, Turtle, of course
I understand why -- it was wonderful!
A small, French patisserie that is easily overlooked due to the low key appearance
Claude is the main character of the place patissier behind the counter
Croissants and cakes are carefully handmade with a quality that is rarely found and probably unmatched in NYC
Once hooked you won't be able to resist
Don't tell anyone
I'm from Italy and this place reminds me of the patisseries back in Europe
I couldn't find anywhere else in the city croissants, brioches and napoleons this fresh and sublime
The apple tart is simply superior to anything I have ever tasted
This place smells always of freshly baked pastries
Claude might seem grumpy at first impression, but he is actually nice and hands you his croissant with a charming voila and merci
A true neighborhood treasure
Homemade every day by Claude and his small staff, every delicious thiing is made from the finest ingredients and family recipes passed down from his father! No kidding, folks
What we like to call Happiness Cake is actually an espresso mousse that fills everyone with sublime joy; you have to try it to believe me
Grab the brioche while you can, it goes fast
The pear tart and apple tartin are simply Parisian and always excellent, as is everythiing I have ever had in the 13 years I have been going there
He goes home for the month of August (true Frenchman) so worship his chubby little hands when you can
Take my word for it, you'll never go to the crummy places on Bleeker again
Few places compare
The Scene Entering this neighborhood treasure is like stepping back in time to a favorite college-era bakery, where pretty women in bandanas worked behind the counter to make enough money to ride off with Jerry and company during the summer
The vibe is hard to resist, and there's a single small table for anyone who wants to linger
The Food These desserts have a cultish following, and it's easy to understand why--nothing on the menu administers anything less than a spectacular dose of sugar
Addictive red velvet cupcakes come slathered in an icing that's as pure an expression of sugar, vanilla and butter as you're going to find
Or try a slice of the decadent "cherries jubilee," a moist mini cheesecake or the legendary banana pudding
Cakes are also excellent, particularly the gorgeous German chocolate cake rich with coconut, caramel and pecans
Personally I think the people writing these reviews either went on a bad day, or are all being typical NY and bashing a good thing
The cupcakes are delicious
The buttercream frosting is so good, and the cake on any cupcake is moist and fluffy
How could you have possibly gotten a stale, blah cupcake, when you have to wait on line for 20 minutes, and people are purchasing them like no one will ever make cupcakes again
Every cupcake is fresh when you buy it
I have never had a bad experience
I have lived in the city for 25 years and been to Magnolia many many times
They have great desserts, and great bevs
The staff is comprised of 20 something, most likely NYU students who have always been super friendly and patient with the crowd lining up around the corner
People are constantly in the shop and I have never gotten bad treatment
You've got to be a real bah humbug to give this place a bad review
Boo on you all!
What is all the fuss about?!? I've been there twice; once on a S** and the City tour, and I was very disappointed
Thought I'd give them another chance on my own during another visit to NYC; again, dry and crumbly
Yuck
I can make better cupcakes from a Betty Crocker box!!!
I'm from Texas and we visited NYC for 2 weeks staying at the Habitue on Horatio St
in the Village
The Magnolia Bakery was on our must do list so with much anticipation we went there, stood in line in this little hot shop for a cupcake that was spectacularly average
Yep
We're glad we stopped in but I don't think we'll ever have to go there again
We did find a chocolate/pastry shop somewhere further down between 4th and 8th in the Houston St
whereabouts that had a much better cupcake (and a larger space)
After seeing the infamous S*ex and the City episode, I HAD to try Magnolia
so I did, and the cupcakes were nice
The chocolate frosting is better than the vanilla which tastes mostly like powdered sugar (which I assume they use as a base), and the cakes themselves have a nice flavor, although they are a little dry
It's a good place to at least try, as they are true old-fashioned cupcakes, but I do prefer Crumbs, which are more moist and have more exciting flavors
The cupcakes were dry, nowhere close to smooth at all
Red velvet cake, smooth and just yum
Go when there are no lines, it's just plain annoying to be there and waiting just for a cupcake
I say try the other things they offer, but pass on the cupcakes
Oh
frosting wise
could be a bit too sweet
All depends on your sweet tooth

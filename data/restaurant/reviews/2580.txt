The server got all our substitutions exactly right, which was great
Companions risked the steak tartare appetizer and loved it
I had soft-shell crabs; one was not as fresh as it should have been
Plate looked great, but was lukewarm
Large Portions
Sauteed spinach was made with chopped garlic from a jar--really bugged me--inexcuseable
Companion had the roast chicken--way over-cooked
Of course we had no time to send it back
Meal ended on a great note with large portion of excellent vanilla ice cream
I would go back
I would recommend it to others, with a warning not to have high expectations with respect to the food
Nothing too great , but it was a nice meal
Surprisingly though we were the only two patrons in this huge restaurant
I went there one Monday night for dinner with a friend and the restaurant is huge, but it was empty and dark that night
My friend had the salmon with bearnaise sauce and enjoyed it
I stuck with lighter fare, having the gravlax and endive salad
Neither of which I would recommend
The gravlax was extremely salty so I had to eat the entire breadbasket to make it palatable
The endive salad was all endive with very little apples, walnuts and blue cheese
The saving graces were the service and dessert :) I had the blueberry tart with coffee which was perfect
I've dined here thrice and visited the bar on many occasions after performances on Broadway
The food was quite good on every visit
The table service is definitely lacking, however, all is more than made up for by Jose, the manager in residence
By the third visit, he and the staff greeted me warmly by name and with handshakes at every arrival
He always made room for me and my guests (even when crowded) and took the time to introduce himself to them and make sure we were well taken care of, even including the ocassional complimentary cocktail
HE is the reason to come to 123
He adds class and charm and an old-world elegance and attention to detail that is next-to-imposiible to find outside of MUCH more expensive and snooty establishments
Bravo Jose!
I love Cafe Un Deux Trois
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I worked there for a few years long ago, but I still never tire of going back to see familiar faces, and I still crave the following things: steak au poivre, gravlax, the leg of lamb with beans, the mustard sauce they use on the chicken at lunch, chicken kiev, the pot roast (but they hardly ever have it), cassoulet and the tarte tatin a la mode
The atmosphere is wonderful and you never know which star you'll see in the evenings
Broadway actors flock to this place
I've been here for romantic meals and before theater dinners with friends
It always fits the bill and can be leisurely or quick
The food is good, the service is just right, and the atmosphere is always wonderful
We have been dining here for many years before theater
It is always dependable though not spectacular
I love the brasserie atmosphere - very Parisian
The brunches are particularly good and reasonably priced at $19
50 including a cocktail
The gravlax is great and so are the omelettes
I also like the steak frittes
I always look forward to coming here and always enjoy my experience
Went for lunch and the food is sub-par, diner quality at best
The bistro atmosphere is nice but noisy
The service was ok- not overly attentative and no check backs
I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone- there are too many interesting places in the theater district and the prices weren't low enough to make up for the rest all though it was fairly inexpensive
What a treat!  A friend recommended that we go here for a pre-theater, weekday dinner
We arrived at 6:00 were promptly attended to by our competent pleasant waitress, who also had a great sense of humor
Prices are decent (for NYC), the food is delicious our waitress had us fed out the door in time to see our show - all without rushing us
If the conduct of a staff truly reflects the management, then the people who run this caf truly know how to run a restaurant manage their staff properly
In a city that seems to be have bad deals, bad food, rip-offs incompetant wait staffs lurking near every GOOD establishment, we were thrilled to have found this gem
By the way, the chocolate mousse is to DIE for!
This place has the best escargot a girl can find
Tourists
Locals
I must warn you
stay away from this horrible restaurant
New York is not like this! The place was completely empty when I entered
The food was ridiculously overpriced
12 dollars for a bacon cheeseburger
19 dollars for a t-bone with eggs
I was told that there was a 4 dollar share food charge
A 6 dollar minimum
My service was bad
My waiter was rude
The food was not good
The gratuity was added in automatically
Smart move, geniuses! I certainly would not have given you a tip
People of the internet: go somewhere else to consume food!!! Anywhere! These people don't even deserve to have customers!!!!!!!!!!
Horridly rude service--avoid this place at all costs
My boyfriend and I stopped and I wasn't hungry
We ordered coffee, and then he ordered a bacon cheeseburger (for $12, ridiculous even for New York) The waiter then announced he was going to charge us a $4 sharing charge
When I said I wasn't eating, he told me that if he saw me take any food from my boyfriend's plate, he would charge us! He was so rude, we cancelled our order and asked for the check-- which he then said would be $6 since they had a per person minimum
Then when we paid the bill, the tip had already been added--a maneuver that I found sneaky and underhanded
The last time I checked, tip wasn't obligatory, and in this case, the waiter certainly didn't deserve it
I will never return to this place, nor would I ever recommend it
Mom and I went in here to grab a bite while waiting to check in for hotel
Waiters were pretty snobby but we were seated quickly and got drinks quickly
After us another couple was seated, I'm not sure what the waiter said to them but the man told him that they are from here and didn't need to be treated that way
HMM?? Anyway, we ordered Chicken soup w/ Matzoh Ball and an eggsalad sandwich
For dessert we had a piece of cheesecake w/ strawberries
Everything was to our liking
Look at your bill when you receive it, on ours 15% gratuity had already been added
I would go to other deli's first if I had a choice, but would also return here if nothing else was around
for breakfast unless you want a snotty look!! Rude and abrupt throughout the service
Over priced, mediocre, at best, food
Will never return
Best place for a quick pre/post theather meal
Great cornedbeef and pastrami
Great cheese cake and coffee
Hey, your one block from times square
A bargain in this area
Big menu filled with NY deli delights
How about some tounge and eggs, kinishes, matza ball soup
Been there twice to make this review
Will go again
Great service!
I took a group of 9 teenagers for dinner after a day of museums - the service was excellent and the food delicious - but to top it off, the check certainly wasn't over the top ($125 for 11 (2 adults too)!! The restaurant is very convenient to Times Square and the Theater district - I'm returning with another group in 3 weeks
Would be great for couples too

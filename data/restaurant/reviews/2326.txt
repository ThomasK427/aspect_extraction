Entrees were well prepared, also- I particularly recommend the lobster creole al diablo
The only entree I tried I did not enjoy was the veal in almond sauce
The sauce was too sweet; it reminded me of duck sauce
Didn' t have dessert
I say go with a large group, don't expect 5-Star cuisine, and you'll have a good time
Every other Indian restuarant I've eaten at in NYC has had better food
I've eaten there twice--the second time purposely not ordering what I had ordered the first time
The chicken was all dark meat--the curry was not spicy at all and the paan was burned
I had the chicken liver as an apetizer and it was nothing like the chicken liver I've had at several other Indian restaurants
Everything I ordered was a disappointment
The entrees are reasonably priced and plentiful - one appetizer and one entree per person will leave you more than full (adding to this, the unlimited rice you can mix with the sauces)
And of course, who can leave out the bread?
This is one of my all time favorite chinese restaurants
Whether taking out or eating in, the food is freshly made and very good
Such a wonderful array of dishes in a relaxed, intimate atmosphere
The prices are great for the amount of food you receive, and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, always checking up on you
The owner himself one time came to our table to clear our dishes when our waiter didn't show (a rare occurance, but it was late at night)
Great place for lunch, dinner, or takeout
What a nice restaurant - Chinese or otherwise
Good food - not too greasy and a nice variety of homestyle and gourmet dishes
A must try for dim-sum brunch as well
We need more like this
Evergreen is a great restaurant which I recommend to everyone
The menu is largely Cantonese which in itself is not so unusual
What IS unusual is the voluminous wine list
Not only is the wine list large, it shows great variety and very LOW markups
I love wine but virtually never order it in NYC restaurants because of the extortionate markups (300-400% above retail prices)
Here the markups are very fair and you will often find difficult to find wines on the list
Moreover, the owner who clearly loves wine will be happy to help you out with suggestions on food and wine pairings in a very friendly and non-threatening way
I highly recommned this restaurant
the service was excellent and the food was even better
This is the best dim sum in NYC less the grime and stench of eating in Chinatown
Kudos to Henry who maintains the accessability and quality of his Sunday dim-sum!
Caffe Med has been our local haunt for years -- the place to go for a casual lunch, a romantic dinner, delicious dessert, or their special summer sangria
Our staple dishes include the gorgonzola salad, focaccia sandwich and lasagna of the day, served EVERYday
We're not such fans of italian, but the lasagna is the best, especially with the homemade bechamel sauce
The ambience is very manhattan: a casual cafe, dimly candle lit, music ranging from budda bar to madonna, short row of tables that serves as the patio
The small space filled with 2 seater tables can get pretty stuffy with smokers on their crowded nights, don't worry, they stay open late for stragglers
The laid back atmosphere is wonderful; the service is so accomodating you have to practially chase after your waitress to finally request for the check! Relax, order one of the freshly shipped desserts from Italy!
I was here on Saturday afternoon for lunch
We had a table for 4
We were seated promplty
Service overall was very good
The sandwiches were nice
Pasta dish was okay
Desserts are very attractive
It did get crowded soon after we arrived and it was kind of hard to hear our table conversation, but still manageable
Prices are kind of expensive for lunch
$6
50 for dessert? That's nyc
This is simply the BEST Thai on the UES! Great food and a lot of fun
Bring a date or come with friends, you will not be disappointed
Tasty, tropical cocktails and outdoor seating too! Delectable desserts (Napolean Creme Brulee) for $5!!! Just go and enjoy it already!
This is the best Thai in the neiborhood for sure!!! The service, the decor and especially the food, YUMMY
Don't miss out on the tom ka gai it is the best I've ever had
The pad thai and all the other noodle dishes are fantastic
Curries - fantastic! I am getting hungry thinking about it! I've never had a bad experience here! An upper east side gem!
The waiter's are adorable, the food original and tasty, the atmosphere is beautiful
I've never had a bad experience here
This is my favorite thai restaurant
The service is excellent and the food is delicious
The Thai steak is moist, tender, and great with the chili sauce
This should have made the survey for NYC's best Thai restaurants
The decor is gorgeous (especially upstairs), the service is impeccable, and the food is wonderful--very balanced sweet/spicy/light--not at all the heavy-handed curry you've come to expect
All the Thai favorites are represented and beautifully turned out
This spot is definately a gem
We sat outside and the manager gave us a complimentary biscuit with honey as well as 2 glasses of wine
The thai salad was great and the Triangle spring rolls were light but were fantastic
The Pad thai noodles were light but a texture that I've never had before
For dessert we ate a coconut icecream which was smooth and not overbearing
Get the price fix
The waitstaff is attentive and extremely polite
this place is hellish you really have to want thai food because this place takes 45-50 mins for delivery but on occassion it takes up to 2HRS or your order Was NO order HELLISH! foods ok though
This is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to
The decor is great and the food is very good and always consistent
The wait staff is always friendly and prompt
I recommend the pre-fix for the best value
The thai-iced tea is fabulous
From the interior to a bill folder - everything has a class at this restaurant
The quality of ingredients is extra-ordinary
Wait staff was notable also
Excellent
This place is incredible! Family-owned and operated, Brunelli's has recipes that stay true to real Italian cuisine
Try the broccoli rabe, you won't be disappointed!
You will truly find one of the best dining experiences at Brunelli
The staff is accomodating and the owner always greets you at the door
The portions, well there damn near impossible to finish
If you have an appetizer, main course and dessert, you will need someone to roll you out
It's a great place for a great meal, at a great price
Don't miss this one
You'll regret it
I love that this one hasn't been discovered by the pack of trend bunnies who flock to restaurants like Il Mulino
The food here, every single item, is absolutely delicious
Well made, generous portions, and they taste FABULOUS
The wait staff is competent and kind and the ambience is perfect - comfortable but not too quiet or too loud, just perfect
Value/cost of meals is totally appropriate, not too pricey
I love this place!!!!!! I cross town to eat there as often as I can
Russ Brunelli makes you feel at home in his restaurant
This place is amazing and a best kept secret in the city
The Italian food is authentic and the portions are huge

Tiny Thai has its own character and style
It is a small Thai restaurant but very charming
We went to dine there last night
We were surprising to see a lot of sexy people in this tiny spot
Food was nice presentation
A nice touch!!!
i think that they advertise themselves as not just another thai on 9th, but i didnt find their restaurant particularly special even though the food was good
the dcor (bright plastic colors) are more chic than the average thai restaurant, but it also strongly resembled places like peep or nooch
we ordered the seafood pad thai ($12
95) the crispy red snapper (daily special, $16)
the pad thai was good mildly spicy, sweet, sour and loaded with seafood
the snapper arrived artfully curved around the vegetables
it was fried on the outside, but the inner white meat was steamed tender
we got thai iced teas with our meal, and that proved to be the only low point of the meal
the tea was overly loaded with condensed milk, so it was overpoweringly sweet at first, but it was followed with a slightly sour aftertaste
Admittedly, This place is the most impressive Thai restaurant in NYC
We love its simple chic design, good music, interesting food, fine service, and inexpensive menu
I feel like eating at home with a modern design atmospher and its very tasty food
I ate at Tiny tonight for the first time with a friend
The place is really cute--red booths, cute lights, dishes with polka dots
The food was all fresh, good, and had some choices that were a little bit off the normal Thai path
If you want a change from your normal mom and pop places, try Tiny!
Cool ambiance and the sounds of acid jazz music
The menu is small but well priced and the wait staff is wonderful
This place is fantastic! I discovered it after reading the great reviews on citysearch and it truly is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
The staff is super courteous and friendly in a genuine way
And, the food is truly amazing - the appetizes I love are the Korean pear salad and the pear pork delight
And for entrees, I always go for the ribeye kalbi or the stonepot bimbimbop (sp?), the marinades are out of this world! For drinks, definitely try their fruit infused soju, it's very light and crisp and actually tastes like mango, strawberry etc
I've brought family members from out of town here and everyone has always been very enthusiastic about their meal
Part of me wants this place to remain undiscovered, so that it continues to be easy to get a table, but New Yorkers should know about this place!
The other night I stumbled upon this restaurant walking down 9th St
between 3rd and 4th Ave
It was closed but I read their menu that was posted on the wall
To my surprise there were a lot of things that I wanted to try so I decided to come back the next day
Upon arriving I was greeted by girls in hanboks (traditional Korean clothing) and seated promptly
I was dumbfounded by the space, I mean, this place was very well constructed and well decorated
I felt like I was in Korea even if it was just a second
The ambiance felt Soho but it is in the EV so the price is moderate but definately not expensive
I ordered golden prawns as an appetizer and stone bowl bibimbop with multi grain rice
As a child I hated multi grain rice but for some reason when the option was given to me I went for it
To my surprise it was literally the best bibimbop I have ever eaten
It even beats K town
The beans and peas in the rice gave the dish an extra kick which I was not used to
I didnt know what to expect from golden prawns
to be honest, as a Korean-American I had no idea what they were
When it arrived, it was a beautifully presented in a European fashion
The bed of radish was the sweet and sour radish side dish that Koreans eat so since they only serve kimchi it was a good pick
The prawns were also delicious
The service is quick
The music is some kinda Korean traditional sanjo/ambient feel
And the servers uniforms, flowers, and decor really encapsulate you to another place
Somehow stumbling down this quiet street I discovered the best kept secret in the east village
I say this because the tourist spillovers from the craziness at Astor Place probably never walk in this direction because it is a half block north of the uptown 6 train so
east villagers check it out
They have an interesting infused soju list with some very cool stuff worth checking out
I have to go back just to drink maybe
Everyone should try Makgully
Its unfiltered Korean rice wine which is similar to milky Japanese sake - but here when you buy a bottle you drink it out of a pot and a bowl with this gourd like spoon as a ladel
Its little details like that give this restaurant this character of authenticity
Its tucked away on a quiet street very close to Astor Pl
Since I visited this restaurant a week ago by my friend's strong recommendation, I revisited to taste more dishes
Unlike typical Korean food, attention is paid to the combination of taste and texture
I highly recommend Kimchi Jun, Tofu Jun, Kuchulpan, bear with grilled pork as appetizer
As a main dish, my favorite is red snapper with mushroom
Try multi-grain rice than plain white rice
It tastes healthy and delicious
I just hope that soon sophisticated and multi-cultural East Villagers will discover this small hidden jewel
This place was phenomenal--from the food to the service to the ambience
But really the best was the food--it was cook and very flavorful
Would definitely come again
i wouldn't claim sura serves authentic korean dishes although a little twist on tradition never hurts anyone
i can't say enough about the food here - hands down the best korean i have had anywhere with beautiful decor to boot
i always scour citysearch for recommended dishes so here are mine: start with pork and pear appetizer (of asian pear and pork), have eel and cream cheese on top of multigrain rice (but do share it's big portion) and you must try beef with gingseng in stone pot
everything was delicious
service impeccable and so friendly
If you've never had Korean food or if you eat it regularly, you MUST dine at Sura's
I myself am new to Korean food and found my experience there superb, from the food to atmosphere and service
The food is beautifully presented and is equally mouthwatering
The atmosphere is simply elegant, with welcoming service
This is now among my favorite dining places
The service and food were excellent
It's a Mom Pop with style
They care about thier food and explain anything you need to know
I work near Sura and their lunch is affordable and great quality
The lunch boxes are awesome with soup and nice sides
Stews are excellent in cold weather
I always feel healthy after eating the food there
It is a great cozy ambiance with excellent friendly service
Great Korean restaurant outside K-town! Definitely not your typical overly bustling, loud and jam-packed Korean restaurant
Sura is a great mix of sophisticated ambiance with classicly refined Korean cuisine
The menu is a spin off of traditional dishes with a creative twist--try the pumpkin noodles and the pork is also fantastic
When I went it wasn't as crowded as it probably should be, but it'll hopefully pick up as word of mouth spreads
I took a visit to Sura (the king's meal) yesterday because there was an article about the restaurant on City section of the New York Times
It was an awesome experience!~ The ambiance is cozy and relaxing, the service was attentive, and the food was just fabulous!~ The famous chef from Hangawi once more proved his talent in haute modern Korean Cuisine
Must try the Pear and Pork, Seafood Pajon, Stone Bibimbob, and the BBQs
I went to Sura with a friend
I just loved the place!!! The food was just so good
I ordered soju cocktail first it was soooo yummy!! it tasted little bit like martini but more freshing and fruity
I was hesitant to try something so new and different but it was just amazing!! My entree was very good, pumpkin porridge was sooo delicious and I had korean pear salad, seared salmon,, it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
very cozy place and staffs are reallly friendly with great service

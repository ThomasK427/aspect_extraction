The atmosphere was not so great, but I think it was worth it
Pretty good food
I've had a lot of Ethiopian (it's big in DC and a few other places I've lived), and this ranks something like a 7 on a 1-10 scale
So on that front, no complaints
HOWEVER, both times I've been there, our waitresses were absolutely terrible--slow, snappish and generally unpleasant
Yes, I know it's college-town and I can certainly understand a bad day
but at least don't be actively mean to your customers when they haven't been mean to you first
I dunno
maybe the restaurant works waitresses too hard? Or just isn't hiring nice ones?
one of the more overloooked, yet fascinating, ethnic cuisines, has the worthy representative in meskerem, the best in nyc (and possibly east coast)
whether you're in the mood for veggie or meats, you've got something to savor here
beef cubes and lentil stews are personal favorites of mine
the only, very slight, minor negativity is the occasional slow service, but that's some very small price to pay for this delicious treat
The best Ethiopian restaurant I have found in New York
I think it has some of the tastiest food I have found in New York
Try the Ethiopian beers when you go
The best Ethiopian Food in town !! A great experience for someone who has not tried eating with their hands !!
I live on the block and I think that Meskerem is absolutely delicious
It's a staple in our weekly diets, and it's perfect for vegetarians
It's such a good bang for your buck - especially the vegetarian combo
Great for everyone!
This is a wonderful place to find really great Ethiopian food
The food is so flavorful, juicy and melts in your mouth
Even for those who have eaten a large variety of foods with a large variety of tastes, the food here will still surprise and amaze you
While the place looks rather small and undecorated, I will definitely go back just for the food
A great find, truly amazing food
In When Harry Met Sally
Billy Chrystal made a funny joke about Ethiopian restaurants; This is great, we'll order two enpty plates and leave
Throw that idea out of the window, I was impressed
Very tasty dishes (except the flat bread they serve, it was awful)
Spicy, flavorful and very filling
The wait staff were friendly and made you feel welcome
We went to the one on MacDougal St, it literally looks like someone's basement
Not much atmosphere and yes, no forks or knives! Try it
Good Ethiopian food - one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in this city
The service is sometimes a little bit inattentive or forgetful, but very friendly
This place is so relaxed and has such consistently yummy food at really great prices
The Scene Rounding the corner and catching site of the Market Diner is like entering another dimension
Not only is it a vision in crenellated aluminum, but the Hell's Kitchen classic actually has a parking lot
"Jetsons"-inspired dcor includes gold-flecked formica tables, faux-snakeskin booths, turquoise-and-chrome striped lunch counter, and orange plastic lamps
The Food Market Diner goes a step above the standard diner formula with an enormous, varied menu
The Greek specialties, in particular, are delicious
They also happen to make a damned fine milkshake
I had the Mexican Benedict and it was delicious
The service overall was pretty good
We went on a Saturday afternoon, and there was enough room in the place
The chef had made a mistake on my friend's order, but they quick took it away and replaced it just as fast
Under a new chef, WBC has migrated towards a more Mediterranean menu while keeping it's terrific staples (thanks for the special tuna tartare!) A lovely place for brunch as well, it's a good regular hang-out for dinner with good food, a comprehensive wine list and pleasant staff
The pasta dishes are consistently good as is the fish and try their soups - seasonal, fresh and delicious
The West Bank Grill exceeded expectations
From the Host to the Waitress, everyone was very accommodating and friendly
We arrived early and sat at the cool yet understated bar
The host asked us if we would like a seat near the window or a booth
The food was great, the beat salad was superb
The presentation was elegant yet not fussy
My only complaint was not having enough options for entrees, but the dessert made up for it
I would defiantly recommend this, especially before a show, its a nice escape from the cheesiness of the Theater District
The sea bass special wasn't memorable -- salty and bland
the service was snobby, hostile and basically rude
For an overpriced restaurant, their silly, inflexible, one entree or two appetizer minimum was absurd
the wine was overpriced, but decent
you can do much better
I have been about seven times, the last after a concert at Carnegie Hall
All of the menu items are fantastic - especially the chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus, as well as the rice pudding - to die for
When I was there last, I saw Daniel Stern and Christopher Reeve
I highly recommend the prix fixe
There are many choices available for a great price
I love it
The only drawback is the need for reservations around the typical pre-theatre times
We arrived earlier than the rest of our party and the staff were unphased by the later additions
The food was wonderful and the restaurant though noisey and crowded still gave us enough privacy to hear each other and feel we were the only table Dan had
The rissota was perfect, and my teenage daughter and her friend loved the attention afforded them
A nice place to meet other theater goers before or after the show
Great bar also
simply the greatest
We love everything about it
Steve who owns it is a great guy
We've reaten there 10 times and have never seen a celebrity
Greta wine list which is affordable
Recently moved to Hell's Kitchen area and was pleased to find such a wonderful neighborhood restaurant
Food is delicious, staff is incredibly friendly and courteous, and the prices are right
Yeah baby yeah
We loved the atmosphere and the appetizers, steak, fish and drinks were so great
The staf was freindlya nd knowledgeable
We were happy to find this restaurant since we love to hit the show and it's right in the theater district
Nice Sunday brunch, a little pricey, however, well worth it
We ate here on July 9th, 2006
The food was top shelf, jumbo shrimp, scallops, a tremendous selection and incredible cuisine, too much to list
Fresh, abundant, items cooked and carved to order, attentive service, the best we ever had
The drinks (5) brought the price to $191
00 for two people with tax and tip included
It was my honey's b-day so money was not an issue
Very expensive and does not compare to it's counterparts
They allow coats to be draped over chairs to drag on the floor (I checked mine)
The dress code is not enforced
Cargo pants, tank tops and t-shirts were all seen on guests
I made a reservation for 4 at a window WELL in advance and did not get a window
The veal and the NY Strip were full of fat
The filet mignon and the seafood pasta were good
This is clearly a tourist attraction or for those who don't know what their money can buy

Our waiter was very attentive, and the food arrived quickly enough
My only complaint would be the not-so-pretty view of 2nd Ave or 34th st, and how cramped the inside of the restaurant is with the big square chairs
I think a big group might have a tough time, but for 4 or fewer people, I would definitely recommend Cinema Cafe
The prices are reasonable, too!
My friend and I ordered two salads and a free-ranged chicken for dinner last night, first of all they messed up our order of two diet cokes which took forever to come and the place wasn't even busy! How hard is it to pour two glasses of diet cokes from the soda gun??? secondly we didn't have a designated waiter to come take our orders so after waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager saw us looking around for someone to take our orders so she took them herself without writing anything down
then soon after some server came out from the back kitchen with a plate of chicken fingers and layed it on our table, we told him we didn't order that so he went to talk to the manager about it
Then the same guy( who knows if he's our waiter) that seated us came by to double check our order so we repeated to him again that we ordered two salad and one chicken, he then double checked with the manager who then admitted that she messed up our oder
10 mins later, we were still waiting with our diet cokes with nothing to eat! I noticed the two girls that came after us already got their salads and were almost done eating! AND I noticed that every table's got a bread basket that we were never offered! so almost 40 minutes after we entered the restaurant the food finally came, the portions were small and nobody offered pepper or refills of sodas! Nobody came to check on us! The fastest thing they did was bringing our check so please if u wanna enjoy a decent meal without the stress don't go to cinema!! i live 2 blocks away from there and it's the worst service I've gotten in a while in my neighborhood! Nobody gives a dam there!
I've eaten here once, and tried to twice
The first time, the food was decent for lunch, but remember mediocre service
The second time, we actually got up and left since the nonchalant waitress was nothing more than annoying and clearly uninterested
The place has a cool setup and its a trendy idea, but the trendy attitude has to go
The leather chairs are inviting as is the dark-ish room accented by movie posters and BW movies playing in the background
The food however, needs help
My husband ordered the Pizza Margerite and it was totally bland and soggy
I ordered the salad Nicoise with salmon and the dressing was tasteless, although the salmon was done perfectly
Perhaps their other dishes offer more culinary adventures than disasters
WHAT A FANTASTIC JOB THEY DID IN TRANSFORMING THIS GREAT DINER TO AN UPSCALE CAFE- LOUNGE
GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT AMBIANCE, GREAT PRICES AND RARE SILENT FILMS
Good regular food -- Diner-ish but with some refinement and a kitschy movie-inspired theme/decor (hence the title of the restaurant)
Nice place for a group of four or a bunch
Service is good, and in the nicer weather the doors/windows open giving the place a nice, comfy flavor
Cinema is a convenient neighborhood diner and the food is pretty good too
However, the service and the waitstaff is the worst! You have to ask for a glass of water, wait 25 minutes for your coffee -- it often comes well after your meal has been served, and no one ever offers to refill
Your waiter/waitress never returns to check on you
It's even a struggle to find someone to bring you your check! We return because of the convenience of it all, but they really need to work on their service, especially considering EJ's is only 3 blocks away, and their service is awesome
It's also a little expensive for what it is -- a bowl of granola (that they pour out of a cereal box) is 8
95!
This was my favorite pub on the upper east side with great chicken wings and burgers and a great staff but unfortunately it has changed hands and is now a stuffy upscale wannabe Irish pub
Bring back the Mug Shot please
Great little spot for wings, burgers, nachos etc
if you tolerate the madman behind the counter
3 visits in a row he's yelling at customers and co workers in the store while screaming into the phone, blaming customers for not knowing how to order, even throwing a stack of menus at the delivery guys
The Buffalo chicken sandwich is also really good
The staff at this restaurant are so friendly the make you feel right at home
The food is great two
Prices are very reasonable
Nice atmosphere, very friendly service and great food
Great for large groups
This restaurant,while always crowded, seems to handle the crowds very well and the food is outstanding! The friendly receptionist and owner make for a family atmosphere and the service was great
PETALUMA IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS WHERE WE ALWAYS SURROUNDED WITH WARM ATMOSPHERE,PROFESSIONAL AND FRIENDLY PERSONNEL,AND YET THEIR FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE
EITHER BIG PARTY CELEBRATIONS OR SIMPLE DINNER FOR TWO MADE US AND OUR FRIENDS ALWAYS VERY HAPPY
WE HIGHLY RECOMMENDPETALUMA TO LOVERS OF ITALIAN CUISINE
I celebrated my birthday dinner here with my family
We were all very happy with the food, service and ambiance
Just about the entire staff sang happy birthday
Overall, I would recommend this fine Italian restaurant to anyone
I have never had a bad meal here
It is not the best, but it is above average and the prices are reasonable
Plus, it's fairly big so you can always get a table without having to wait forever
I continue to go back every few months and I'm never disappointed
Had the pasta with cream sauce and smoked salmon
Very bland and overpriced
Just an average restaurant at best
In Short Situated on the ground floor of a high-rise building on an unassuming Upper East Side corner, this Dallas BBQ--one of several in Manhattan--is a labyrinth of several mirrored dining rooms and an enclosed sundeck, all decorated with canopied ceilings and Texas kitsch
The food is barbecued ribs, rotisserie chicken, steak, shrimp and combos thereof
Side orders of beef chili, corn on the cob, baked beans, cornbread and so forth round out the meal
I have had bbq all over the u
s
Dallas BBq is terrible
I went there twice
The food was barely decent, the ribs were not cooked right, the sauce tastes like catsup
the service was just average if that, both times our servers looked like they didnt want to be there
i had to pull them over on both visits to ask for more water, napkins, things they should be stopping by to check on
Truly dissapointed, enough to write this review
Don't waste your time
I'm telling you, it just wasnt up to snuff
Besides that, the one on 1265 Third was funky, dirty carpeting, looked like it is in need of a serious cleaning
The emp's unifirms looked terrible and no name tags on anyone!! I resorted to calling our guy hey the whole time
I will never go back
Truly a dissapointing experience
Dallas BBQs is an amazing place to eat, it has great food and great prices, small seats, but if my 211 lb
butt can get into them, so can you
The service is always A #1
Check it out
Trust me, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain
The texas sized drinks are huge-mous
I ordered a burger with french fries
when I saw it, I knew I would be full to the point of disgust
I didn't notice that my fork wasn't clean until the waiter told me
o
o The food wasn't bad
I have to agree with the previous reviewer
The food isn't horrible, but it isn't even close to good
It is very greasy
The drinks are big, but they aren't overwhelmingly tasty
There are so many other places to go, why bother wasting your time
Dallas is nothing more than a glorified BBQ version of Mc Donalds
It's obviously a factory restaurant
If you are looking for greasy fast food then eat here
It's not horrible tasting but its not that good either
Yes the drinks are big
but they are filled with bad liquor
My advice
Skip the dinner
have a couple of the Texas sized drinks and be on your merry way to your land of partying bliss
when your living in a city that could charge $20 for a half chicken its nice to see you can still get a whole chicken for $12
The honey chicken is my fav
and the drinks are as big as your head for half the price of say a friday's or someplace that has come to be known for those huge drinks
I had an excellent lunch at this resturant

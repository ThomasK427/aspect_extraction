Good size portions
If you don't want to sit at the grill table, there is seating in the dining hall
There is a small section for the sushi bar as well
The bar is well stocked and they are always willing to put the game on for you
I went there for dinner, after which decided to have my bday party there
food is great, prices are descent, service is good, music is great
They also have a 3 course lunch special all week for $5
After my birthday party banquet, I've gone there many times with my friends and family
I definitely recommend it
If not for dinner, then definitely to try the $5 lunch menu
I couldn't believe this place
The food was stacked on tables, the vodka kept flowing, the music kept playing, and I had a great time
This restaurant is stuck in the past
Food is average, music is old and too loud
Its like a bad old movie
There are plenty of good Russian restaurants in the area
Do not waist your time on this one
I come here all the time
The food is awesome
Very cheesy wanna be romantic decor and entertainment, but have some vodka and you want to come right out onto the dance floor and dance the night away to a mix of really bad russian and american disco music
I love Russian food and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn is the place to be for fine Russian food
Primorski has it all! Great food, excellent service, beautiful girls and exciting music entertainment
I love eating, drinking and dancing
This is why I love Primorski, it has it all
I highly recommend Primorski for a real authentic Russian treat!
This place is such a find! Happened to stumble upon it during my first trip to Brighton Beach
Wasn't sure it was open at first, as it was nearly empty on a Thursday evening
But soon the live band (two Russian relics, one on keyboard/synthesizer the other on guitar) started playing - everything from polka-type tunes to 80s/90s pop (Wham!, Clapton, Sade)
They were a scream! Just when I thought it couldn't get any more kitschy, the mirrorball started spinning, the rainbow disco lights started flashing, and the dry ice cast a dreamy fog over the dance floor!
As for the food, it was delicious
Added bonus: Large portions
(Be sure to check out the picture portion of the menu!!) The Ukrainian borscht was second only to my dearly departed grandmothers

Everyone owes it to themselves to experience this place at least once!!
I really like this place
This is how I picture eating in Russia would be
Sure the service isn't the best but the food is tasty and the prices are great
The mixed salad platter and the Beef strogonoff are fabulous
I always bring my friends to this restauraunt when visiting Brighton Beach
There are many times when I have groups coming and visiting the city
Without fail, I always bring them to the Primorski for a Russian lunch
Their lunch menu is only $5! For the little that you pay, you get a huge taste of Russian cuisine, including the best borscht in town! If you travel to this restaraunt please be sure to order the Georgian Bread
You'll want to take it home with you!   If you'll excuse me, I need to run
I have a group of 17 that I'm meeting at the Primorski for lunch
Waited for 20 minutes and no one comes to serve
(waitress smokes near youv but never comes) Rude attitude when taking order
DON'T TRY IT!!
The 'people watching' and table location (on boardwalk) made up for the rude service
The wait staff (at my table, anyway) were impatient, curt and unattentive
We ordered a dessert that was described on the menu as Hot Apple Strudel with Ice Cream
The Strudel arrived cold
I politely brought this to her attention and she was very resistant saying that is the way it was supposed to beand that it was hot when she brought it
Please! Growling at us when we asked for water is one thing, but to just lie and make NO effort to satisfy, or apologize at these moderately high prices ($12
00 for the strudel) is unacceptable
They did replace the Strudel with the same strudel that was obviously microwaved for a minute (just warm) and dropped back on the same plate with the same melting ice cream
Don't expect treatment equal to the prices
Tatiana has the most extensive menu of any restaurant I've visited
There are easily over 100 entrees
The food is very good and well presented
The grilled sea bass was delicious, as was the Greek salad
The staff is not extremely attentive and could be a bit more courteous, but the food and the pleasant ocean breeze will keep me coming back
Great food, cant get any better, so much fun
Music was great
The ONLY bad thing about this restuarant is it's small dnace floor
Other wise this is definetly among the top 5 restaurants NY has to offer
The food is unbeatable!!!!!! The music is great!!! the place has an awesome decore, with fish swiming below certain tables
This Restaurant, i have to tell you has the best entertainment, the show and the costumes are breath taking!!!!!! IT REALLY IS! I have gone to many Russian Restaurant but Tatiana has out beaten all of them
There food is finger licking good
You want to lick the plate how delicious it is
The music kept me dancing all night
They even have a huge seat selection out doors right on the boardwalk w/ a great view
This restaurant is the#1 restaurant of all times
I only go to Tatiana !!!
This place is a relic
Out of al the diners in brklyn if I ahve a choice I always choose this one
Nothing special or complicated here just awesoe diner food served up in a chill laid back space
Doesnt hurt that if you wnat a late night mela this is teh only place youll find that actually ahs an afterhours party of sorts already in progress
El Greco is not a pretentious establishment
It is a diner that does not claim to be anything but
the food is simple, but very good, and the portions are huge especially given the low prices
The cups of tea and coffee are bottomless
The 95% attractive female staff is courteous and friendly
The bathrooms leave a bit to be desired, but are acceptable
the best diner you can go to is on 1821 emmons
the hosteses and the bartenders are goregous!The food and the atmospherreis great
It is the store and the restaurant in one
I think the food is the same in both
I was there several years ago it use to be much better
There was a show and a band
Now its only average food and service
Very Boring
I don't know if this title is talking about the resturant or the place right next door to it
If its the store next door then this place is sort of all the stuff they had left over from the actual restaurant named 'Odessa'
Its okay, if your in a hurry, but if you want russian food you should go to the restaurant instead
Its alot better than some of the other stores on brighten though, its not overcrowded, and you don't have to squeeze yourself to get inside
For the ratings I am going to rate the resturant, not the store
The place insisted on theri pre fix and thats a rip off!! The food is not all that and they are quick to push you out
This is a wonderful mix of food from Turkey and the Caucasus
The atmosphere is phenomenal, the service is courteous and the food is delicious
As with many such restaurants, you are allowed to bring your own wine and there is no corking fee

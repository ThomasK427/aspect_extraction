I lived in the neighborhood of Piccolo Angolo for several years, eaten there numerous times, and I've watched the place go downhill for a while
The food is average family style italian, the tables are too close together, and the last two times I went the service was lousy
The manager pressured us into ordering things we didn't really want, like nast stuffed clams, which tasted awful, and then proceded to hang around our table all night annoying us with his inane chatter
I'd definitely steer clear of this place and go elswhere for my Italian dinners
I am fairly new to NYC and have tried all types of restaurants
The only one I keep returning to, is Piccolo
The prices are low, the food is great
It is that simple
I am surprised by the neg
comments about the size and service? The service is authentic, friendly, no frills
Yes, they are busy
That is a good sign, no? As for the size? HELLLLO, this is NYC - if you want large and luxurious, other aspects will suffer, like the PRICES, food quality, etc
I love the ambience and have brought MANY friends there all with glowing reviews
Authentic and Fabulous NYC at it's best!
Absolutely best food in the city
I would not review this place for a long time because I didn't want the secret to get out more than it has already, but the ratings have not done it justice
By far one of my favorite NYC restaurants! I have been there numerous times and everytime I leave soo happy
The food is great, the wine is wonderful, and the atmosphere is classic
Such personality! A little crowded but it just adds to its' charm
The lobster caneloni is to die for! You must have a reservation
This is one of the most charming, inexpensive, delicious restaurants in the city
It's the quintessential romantic neighborhood italian joint with free flowing wine and an eccentric owner
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city!
The food sucks, the ambience sucks even more, and the service sucks the most
Standard uncreative American Italian food one can find anywhere else
Tables are so closed together that waiters can't even get around
Very noisy so everyone is shouting
Owner(I assume he is, else he would have been fired already) was arrogant and impatient
Unpleasant experience overall
My favorite Italian restaurant in the city
The lobster canneloni, wild mushroom ravioli, and baked oysters and clams are all heavenly
The owner Renato is lovely, if eccentric
The homemade red wine is the nectar of the gods
But you absolutely must make reservations; apparently some folks have had problems, but they've never lost my reservation
Also try their family-style dinner for a big group--it's an incredible value
But you have to call ahead to arrange it
I see a lot of complaints about slow service, and here's why
The only person you'll see on the floor is the CEO, Chef, and Waiter at this small West Village Restaurant
What he lacks in speed he makes up in tasty food, and charisma
The caipirinha, a famous brazilian drink renown for getting you drunk with just 2 shots is also served here, but it's not the way it should be, it's weak and nearly sugarless
This is a very small 4 tables or so restaurant with a very modest enviornment, so if you're with business partners for lunch or dinner, Plataforma Restaurant or Brazil Grill are the better choices, but if you got a lot of time with some buddies of yours, then this one may be for you
Had gone once in Sept, had a great time although it took 30 min to get a glass of water refilled
After making a high recommendation, went again on a Friday night in Oct with a 8 people
Sat promptly, everyone except one decided to do the $55 pre fixe
As we're all eating, enjoying, the rude owner comes out and scolds a girl at the table for eating a yuca chip, saying the food plates were only for the pre fixe patrons
Fine whatever, but the guy comes back to embarass her 2 more times as she's sitting there not eating at all
Guy was a real jerk, we live on that street and will never go back
One of my boyfriend's colleagues is Brazilian - this is her home away from home
Wonderful food, very reasonable, and a welcoming atmosphere: the feel is of being a guest in someone's living room
Service is slow, yes, but remember that that's pretty authentic, too
Especially recommended are the feijoada - a black been, pork, and sausage stew that's one of Brazil's national dishes - and the luxuriant camaraos na moranga, shrimp cooked with tomatoes a sort of cream cheese in a pumpkin
Went with a large party and ordered the pre-fix for 27
50
Found out you can't order individually
For 27
50 in the West Village, I deserve to choose what I eat, not have family style
Its also a rip off considering you can order 3 courses a la carte for $25
Dinner started at 8pm; the last appetizer arrived 2 1/2 hours later
No one ever asked if we needed anything
Cheese ball and Fish Croquette tasted out of a school cafeteria
Their signature beef entree was tough, dry, and over peppered
Lastly, only 1 unisex bathroom for entire restaurant for which there was usually a line
Go elsewhere
My girlfriend and I visited Delicia last night
The limey tartness of a caiparinha; fresh pan de quejo; simple beans and rice, yucca and the swordfish stew; and amiable service made this a fun night out on West 11th
The books in the bathroom, by the way, made for an interesting yet homey touch
I really enjoy almost everything about Delicias, except the length of time you have to wait sometimes
The food is great and really reasonable
You just have to remember not to be in a rush to eat, relax
Then when you are done eating, don't be in a rush to leave
The check may take a while to get to you
Sometimes it's good to slow down
The food was really good
Moqueca de Peixe is super nice, it comes with swordfish, and so gentle
Fill your thirst with the passion fruit caipirinhas and have fun
The wait people are very friendly brasilians
I loved this place
This place is a must for anyone who knows real Brasilian food!
Everything is just like home at Delicia
Great hearty food (The swordfish stew is a must!) and the sweetest service you could ever ask for
And their cute too
No one in the world can fit into jeans like Brazillian women
twice i ordered lunch for a number of people and it showed up two hours late
when i called the second time i was told my food was not coming and was hung up on
the food arrived two hours late and the delivery boy fought with me saying that i had to pay for it
extremely bad customer service
i will NEVER order from here again and i will suggest to as many people as possible to avoid this resturant
Usually go here before heading into the Tiger to drown my sorrows
The gyro platter is a win, especially without onions
The gyro sandwich is also decent
Just wish the staff would recognize me
I've eaten there dozens of times
I have been eating here for years and can tell you that the food is consistently above par
This is the best food for the best price in New York City in the world of Chinese dining
When you get to know the owners, they are warm and friendly and cater to your every whim and need
Additionally, if you order up the food is always delivered on time, hot and steamy
Love this place
The food is quite tasty and represents good value, but this is often overshadowed by the noticably unfriendly service
This is the place to eat!!! look in the city where a hot dog on the street is $2 to eat a GREAT MEAL for $25 (FOR TWO!!!!) is AMAZING!!!! The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
THE BEST FOOD -- Always FRESH -- GREAT SUSHI

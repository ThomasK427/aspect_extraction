If you want Latin food don't waste your money here, go to Jackson Heights and pay half the price
Went to Cabana for lunch on a Sunday afternoon although I was disappointed the lunch special wasn't applied
I order the Jerk Chicken full price off the menu
Very good but not spicy enough
Great for the average gringo but this Korean likes spice! Nevertheless, its one of my fave restaurant in Forest Hills to eat
Recommended
Normally, when I go out to a restaurant I just get my main course or an appetizer - depending on my mood
However, as soon as we walked into Cabana I was already salivating over the menu
The food is amazing from the appetizers - the Tostones are great to the main dish to the dessert to the coffee
This is definately a restaurant that I recommend to people and that is always a suggestion on where to eat on any given night
I had a great experience
Everything from their special Sangria to their appetizers and entre were full of flavor, fresh and fun
I would highly reccommend it if you're in the mood for food with a lot of flavor
I've brought my friends here for a few drinks
There's music but not too loud so that you can have a conversation without straining your voice
Its dark with lit candles which gives it good ambience
The staff seems ok
With a recent name change and no advertising, I was suprised to find Network Cafe hidden on a side street, across from the Irish Cottage in Forest Hills
I've visited often for a few years to enjoy their delicious food and elegant atmosphere
The downstairs lounge area is worth a peek, too
The pretty waitstaff is always pleasant, but service is inconsistent at best
If you're not in a hurry, get thee to Network Cafe
One of the last remaining non meat head bars in the area
You feel like youre in a local bar in Manhattan, or better yet, Ireland
The service is friendly, the food is good, and the crowd is mellow
A good juke box too
The drinks are reasonablly priced and they pour the Guinness well
The bartenders are all Irish and friendly
Good place for stopping by after dinner or a movie
Good place with a good mixed crowd
Very liad back cool crowd
Thursday is especially good with the live music
The only problem is they don't buy back enough - you're lucky if you get one on every fourth, and if you're served by more than one bartender, it's even worse
I've been here a few times
This place had great dim sum, but I didn't think there was a lot of selection
There were only about 2-3 carts
Parking is great
It can get crowded on Sundays, but I think you can get seated faster here than other places
You don't need to go to Chinatown for great dim sum, and you don't need to compete with the hordes in Flushing either; Golden Pond in Forest Hills has consistently great food! All my favorite dim sum, especially the flaky pastry that contains either curry chicken or roast pork
And the main entrees are also great
Don't drive because parking's impossible; take the F train to 75th Ave you're half a block away
Because we were too tired to go from our hotel over into Manhattan, we took the concierge's advice to check out the Austin St area
There are lots of restaurants there -- and I was really happy that we settled on this one
It is not a very stylish place, but we had some of the best Chinese food we ever had
Their Peking duck is delicious! They prepare it as little rolls at your table
The service is friendly and attentive
(And, oddly, they serve pretty good sangria, too
) Two thumbs up!
Been here several times
Not very fancy, but the food here is very good, especially for a restaurant outside of a Chinese area
You must try the staple dish, the peking duck
The duck is crispy and juicy and has a lot of flavor
The seafood here is also very fresh
Oh, and the noodle dishes are excellent cause they are made on site
The wait staff was very polite and attentive
The only thing that I was unhappy about was that one time, the restaurant received a delivery of supplies and the rolled it in through the dining area into the back kitchen, with the deliverymen shouting loud things to each other in chinese
This happened while many diners were enjoying their meal and it was rudes
But otherwise, if you are looking for some good authentic Chinese food in Queens, definitely give this place a try
We've been going here for years and have never been disappointed
From the appetizers to the spectacular and always improving wine list, to the delicious entrees
And you must try the strawberry zabaglione dessert! Sylvana (the owner) is like the italian mother you always wanted
Good for a couple, family, or a group
Alberto Restaurant is a GREAT restaurant---Fabulous Food, Intimate Setting Superb Service! Go during the week for a relaxed meal or if going on the weekend, make sure you make a reservation--the place is always jammed
They have a great wine list too---Wine Spectator awards for the last five years
Alberto's is my favorite restaurant in Queens!!!!!!!!!
The ambience and food quality makes Alberto my absolute favorite restaurant
The only negative is that the decor, brick walls, makes the place a bit noisy, otherwise super
The only negative is the place is a bit noisy
Otherwise its a real gem
NOTHING TO SAY, EXCEPT BEST FOOD AND SERVICE AROUND IN A LONG TIME
Do not eat here
The staff is rude and the food is mediocre
The food is never prepared as requested
The only good thing is the ribs
I visted Santa Fe Steakhouse for the first time last week and I was immediately impressed with everything
I ordered a prime rib and it was cooked to perfection and very flavorful
The atmoshpere in the restaurant is very cheerful and the staff seemed eager to please the guests
I would highly recommend this restaurant
Santa Fe is a great neighborhood restaurant and well worth traveling to as well
The staff is always helpful and friendly and the food is always outstanding
Keep up the good work Santa Fe!
I went to Santa Fe with a group of about 13 people and thought it was ok
The nachos were very very good, but the onion bloom felt too greasy and the calamari was soggy
I ordered the filet mignon medium rare
I thought it was a little on the thin side, and way too rare
I noticed that they labeled several of the steaks we ordered wrong, and two steaks that were supposed to be the medium were way off
One was medium well and the other was well done
This is disappointing, since I am a huuuge steak fan
I'd still go back and give it another try
but I feel that for the $$ we paid it wasn't worth it
Whoever wrote the previous reviews must of been the owners or partners of this horrible place
I'd rather go to outback steakhouse and that place sucks too
High rating of 9
0?! why? cause its sponsored
Time to get honest citysearch
this place sucks
The food and the service at santafe is excelent
The servers do their best to accommodate the wishes of every customers that walk into its doors
I have seen some of these servers put up with a lot of difficult cilents and I was very impressed by the way they handled the situation
I'm thrilled with the quality of the food and the service! The ribs superb, the steak, the chicken wings, the french fries, the hamburger

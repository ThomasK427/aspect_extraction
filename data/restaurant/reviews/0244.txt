Great food and a great mojito
Cannot wait to get a chance to go back
Very good tapas and sangria
Best of all the wait staff is not only very nice, but nice to look at! Highly recommended for a quiet date
What a nice place! And what a huuuge garden! I've been there a couple of times, but every time is even better than before
The food was great, we got some Tapas ( the Cigalas and ham Croquetas are amazing), and the Lamb chops was just to die for, same thing for the apple stuffed Pork
The wine selection is pretty good, and the night just lovely
They also have Sangria
A perfect place to be outdoor and have lots of fun
I'll be back soon , definiteli
I do recommend this place for everybody that enjoys good food, fun and satisfaction!
I found 1492 to be a real find in the lower east side
In the summer, they have outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant, which is romantic (even though it's separated from a basketball court by a wire fence, it's still charming)
The tapas there are very, very cheap by Manhattan standards ($5-$8), and tasty! They are great to eat with the bread they serve (which comes with a very garlicky butter spread)
Entrees are large and considerably more expensive ($18 and up)
If you prefer variety, you can definitely make a dinner out of the tapas and bread
Definitely try the almond and dates wrapped in bacon, the garlic shrimp, and the cold platter with various meats and cheese
One downside here: waiters aren't so great, and have quite an attitude
But imagine--without alcohol, dinner for two can easily be under $30! In Manhattan!
I went here on a Saturday night with a group of friends and will definitely not be going back! The service was terrible - we had to ask for the check 10 times before they brought it and we spent about 2 1/2 - 3 hours waiting for the food
When the food arrived, all we could taste was garlic - this is not a true representation of what Tapas should be like
While waiting for our reservation at one of the hot spots on Clinton st
we went for a drink in 1492
We decided to order some appetizers at the bar
They were so great that when we went for dinner at swanky Suba we were dissapointed and upset that we ever left 1492
Since then we've been back for a great meal and I'm planning a dinner for 10 in their lovely outdoor patio
It's kind on the wallet and you could visit the Freakatorium across the street
Granted, the food here did not blow me away, but it was very solid
We tried a broad range of the tapas and the quality varied from good to very good
The food reminded me of Spain: not very complicated, but satisfying
I would recommend this place if you're looking for a very relaxing ambience, decent food, and extremely fair prices
I just had my second visit this weekend and again left very satisfied
The food is right on and creative
If you love garlic, you will not be disappointed
The place also has a great ambiance and a good crowd
The staff is very accomodating as well
Only knock is that the shrimp scampi was a little overcooked
I wanted to love this place
the sexy lighting and interior, the attractive staff, the hot location
but 1492 didn't deliver
The food was salty, paltry and overpriced
Our plate of manchego and jamon looked and tasted like Kraft cheese and Hormel sausage
The only winner was the deep fried dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with garlic
but with only 5 pieces for the racion serving, we were left wanting more
Skip the food and go for the sangria
Love the food and excellent service
Location is nice, good place to spend an evening with wine and good Italian food
Recommend to go during warm season and seat outside
I've been there twice and the service was excellent, the food was incredible
Love this place
and wife comes from a sicilian household, so we typically skip italian places all over the city b/c they almost never compare to mom
but this one is a keeper, and we love that it is almost never packed
we get great food, great service, reasonable $ etc
a local winner
You have to love this place--knowledgeable, accomodating wait staff (most of the time, anyway) coupled with great food and a reasonable, eclectic wine list
The standard menu is great, and the specials are the ultimate wildcard--don't make your mind up before hearing them
To the Manhattan crowd that comes over and is 'so surprised' to experience such a great find outside of Manhattan, this here Astoria country bumpkin would be happy to share his favorite neighborhood restaurant with you
Going to Astoria for Italian food seems counter-intuitive, and I found out last week that it really is a bad idea
The ambiance would have been lovely but for Kenny G being blasted into the dining room, but the food was just NOT good
The tomato sauce is absolutely tasteless - to me, it didn't even taste like tomato, let alone garlic or herbs! Every piece of seafood, from the soggy fried calamari to the seafood stew to the lobster special, was overcooked
Salad ingredients, like rubbery fresh mozzerella and too-tart balsamic, were not high quality
The grilled sausage was soaked in liquor to hide the fact that the sausages were lower quality than your average Brown 'n Serve
The wine list is excellent, but the food is AWFUL
Though the prices aren't high, they're not low either, and you can get MUCH more bang for your buck elsewhere
On the last Monday of the month for over two years wine food lovers gather for an all-inclusive Wine Dinner
This Family run place has showcased wine from around the world and the wine expert that co ordinates these dinners (Elmer Contreras A
S
A
) rocks with his pairings
Guests have included Shirley Alpert from House Of Burgundy Bill Whiting from Banfi,Jeremy Ensey the Becco wine director and more
but it's not wine snobby it is just a fun night with 6 or 7 courses backed by 6 or so matched wines
No need to know about wine just need to know how to have fun
Wineturtle loves this place
The last Monday in every month is Wine Dinner night, Wineturtle has been to many of them and always has fun, and learns a couple of somethings each time
The brothers who run this place step up to the plate each time with food and wine pairings that are great
Props to Elmer Contreras, ASA member and guiding light for these dinners
They are not at all Wine Geeky but aim at the average casual drinkerand are a great VALUE
You get 5 or 6 courses matched with 5 or 6 wines
Inexpessive way to broaden your palate
Everything was very nice
The pasta with eggplant and mozz was delicious; the calamari was lightly fried and not chewy at all
One thing I can't recommend is the stuffed clams -- too SALTY!! I'll definately go back
We were one out of two couples in the restaurant
Once they took our wine order, it took 45 minutes for it to arrive, even though the waiter was talking to a patron next to us
We asked them three times for him to bring our wine
We were not in a rush but 45 minutes is ridiculous!!! We were told they were too busy
There were only 4 people in the place!! The food was good but the horrendous service ruined it
I have never complained about a restaurant before, we are not fussy people but this was horrible
When it came time to pay, they not only came over, but hounded us for it! I have never witnessed a restaurant with ruder, more incompetent staff
We complained throughout the meal and afterwards, were given no apologies, nor any reason
I DO NOT recommend this place
Definitely worth crossing over the 59th street bridge
Great food, romantic setting and exceptional service
Most importantly when it came to paying the bill, we had gotten way more than what we paid for
But, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance unless you want to wait a half hour for a table
Then again, waiting in their wine bar isn't so bad either
i used to like this restaurant
my friends used to like this restaurant
when 2 people at the same table order filet mignon medium rare and one is undercooked and the other is over cooked there is a problem
one time there is fresh bread brought to the table another time you have to ask for it and then get stale, hard cubes of foccacia

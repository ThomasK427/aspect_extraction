When searching for restaurants I always look for a price range so
(Appitizers are about $8 and Entrees $16-23)
But trust me, it is worth the money! I would recommend it to all who wish to really treat themselves or a loved one to a special occasion
Thank you Danny my baby @--/----
I have been there for casual dinners and for special events and the restaurant (and bar) have risen to the occassion time and time again
I especially love the mussels and fries special on monday night: for $15 bucks you get mussels, fries and a beer
Plus, the ambiance can't be beat
I think the crowd, ambience, and food are great
The only thing that falls short is the wine list
Expensive for what is by the glass
They need to work on their burgundy section
Until then, I'll have a Stella
A good restaurant that we will visit again, no doubt
The food is good and authentic, the service is friendly although a little unprofessional
The wine was great and the last good surprise was the check, very reasonable
the price fix brunch is one of the best on the uppereast side
a must try!
I'd like to think that my brunch was an isolated incident, but just in case it is not, DON'T GET THE STEAK AND EGGS
My frites were great, but the steak was awful
Ambience is nice, but simple
Service was good, just a tad slow
What's the point in putting out the lunch menu if you aren't serving lunch? There are too many French restaurants in the city for me to go back to Jacques
I HAVE BEEN GOING TO JACQUES FOR YEARS
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR DELICIOUS CREPES
BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED AT FIRST TO FIND THAT THEY HAD RENOVATED AND CHANGED THEIR MENU
WHY MESS WITH PERFECTION
THE PLACE HAS ONLY GOTTEN BETTER OVER THE YEARS
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PLACES IN THE CITY FOR SAT OR SUN BRUNCH
THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS AND REASONABLY PRICED
THE SERVICE CAN BE A LITTLE SLOW AT TIMES, BUT THEY NEVER RUSH YOU AND ALLOW YOU TO ENJOY YOUR MEAL!  A GREAT LITTLE FIND ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE!
The Scene At the Manhattan outpost of a Coney Island-based legend, an outdoor patio leads to a long, dim room with chalkboard specials against a side wall and baby strollers littered among the tables
Regardless of the noise created by the pitter-patter of tiny feet, service is attentive, friendly and meticulous
The Food Some say this is New York's best pizza, and indeed the sauce is light, the cheese fresh, the crust salted and rightly charred
But the 16-inch pies can also come vaguely soggy and not entirely hot, and the famously delectable white pie can be bland and dry
Similarly, staples like veal parmagiana are a little tough and rigatoni alla vodka could use less boiling and more chewiness, although the sauce is tasty and creamy
On the other hand, the chopped salad is chock-full of fresh, delicious ingredients
nothing special
pizza was really good, but nothing to write home about
I've dined at Totonno's three times now and still can't muster up the enthusiasm to rave about this place
The pizza is good, but for $20-something a pie, one must wonder if it's worth it
My boyfriend is a fan of their veal parm and their salads are okay (adding the salami / cheese combo is a must!)
Don't expect friendly or attentive service
OR an ambience that is anything more than tacky
Also, be wary of what time of the day you go; around dinnertime, the restaurant becomes a jungle of diners and hustling waitresses
Yes, sometimes the service is better than others, and the place can be noisy, but this pizza is great
If you find the crust soggy, get the Margherita, I have never had red sauce pizza that good
The white tends to get soggy and is overly garlicky
Salads are also good - Caesar and Arugula with gorgonzola
The pizza is good, that's true, but not worth raving about, and it is wildly overpriced
The house wine was terrible, salads are decent, other italian food is average
Very unfriendly service, extremely noisy dining room
I've been there a few times for the pizza, but I eventually decided it's not worth the hassle
I cannot say that this is the best pizza in NYC; I will leave that title to Lombardi's
This is the best pizza on the UES though
I have been to Totonno's dozens of times and have never had soggy, lukewarm, or bad pizza which some reviewers experienced
The title says it all
Whenever an out of towner asks for good NY pizza, this is what they get and it never disappoints
If you like dry pizza with a side of burn come here
It was honestly the worst place I've been
my roomies hated it as well
Even Famous Ray's is better
Stay away!
Totonno's is known for it's pizza and the 2nd ave joint didn't perform up to par! the pizza needs to be less soggier and a lot hotter
it came out lukewarm
In matters of minutes, the pizza, especially the white pie, became cold and the cheese went dry
The original one is still the reigning champ of Totonno in Brooklyn
2nd ave needs to adopt better techniques in making the pizza like bringing it out blazing hot and more crust to prevent sogginess
~disappointed~
for pizza its pretty good, but for sit down pie its just ok, afterwards I was contently full
went with party of four, underwhelmed because the other couple talked it up and planned it out two weeks in adance
pizza: ok, outside crust was excellent, not hot enough
service: if you are out of the way and can't make eye contact you'll never see water, refills, parasean, or anything else-but they are friendly and helpful  summary: its just pizza
if you are hungry for pizza and you happen to be on the block, knock yourself out
I traveled 50 blocks and waited two weeks, so you can understand my mild opinion
I did eat five slices and stuffed my face, followed by a walk up the block to Stone Cold Creamery  for an awesome desert
I was very content
I suppose the pizza is better than your average storefront slice joint, but a restaurant's pizza has to be pretty spectacular to be a destination spot and this place is barely worth crossing the street for
I haven't been to the original Coney Island location, but the Manhattan location is a joke
It's tasteless
Don't waste your time
Go to Patsy's on 117th and 1st or Johnny's in Mt
Vernon, NY
There are several pizza places which are resting on their laurels - Lombardi's, Grimaldi's and John's among them
But Totonno's has really lost it altogether
Of the classic places - places 60+ years old, only Patsy's and Sally's in New Haven, have really kept up the tradition
But to be fair, I still have to trek out the Coney Island
I went to this restaurant with my husband, a friend and my 7 month old baby
The owner of the restaurant told us we had to move our seat
I explained that we were seated there by someone on her staff
She did not care, and basically told us to leave
She kicked us out of the restaurant because we had a baby (who did not make a peep during this incident)
She was a very mean person and should not be allowed to run a business
If you don't already know this, it is of critical importance that you learn it quickly: the famous Totono's that everyone raves about is in CONEY ISLAND, BROOKLYN
This Manhattan location isn't even associated with that one! All they've licensed is the name! And if you eat a pizza from both places, it will take you a millisecond to realize the difference! While this Manhattan location serves better-than-average pizza, it doesn't come close to the Coney Island location
It's good -- really good
And it tries to be like the other Totonno's
I'm not sure if it's the oven, the ingredients, or simply the guy making the pizza, but if someone tells you to go to Totonno's, get yourself on a Brooklyn bound train and get yourself to Coney Island -- soon!
Excellent, friendly service
Great bartenders
Clientelle from every age group

But what would have been a pleasant experience was spoiled by the attitude and actions of the wait staff and the management
They did not seem to be interested in having us return as customers and when we questioned an item on the bill it was met with a shrug of the shoulders and an attitude of If you don't like it, don't come back
We won't
I was very keen to try this place after reading all the great reviews but have to confess I was rather disappointed
Yes, the food is decent enough and reasonably priced (although the Panini doesn't even compare to the well-known panini cafe close-by
), but the service was very slow too
It started off OK, but we waited around 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches and about 20 minutes for the check
And we were the only people in there at this point
The staff seemed more interested in entertaining themselves than serving customers
we walked in and were surprised it was a restaurant, it looked more like a cafe than anything
i ordered the lasagna (was 12
95) and it was amazing!! i was pleasantly surprised
it's a pretty casual place overall
Its the best kept secret in the Village
From the friendly ambiance, to the delicous and exquisite dining, to the dinningware that you can take home, Noi is the best kept secret in the village
Not only is the owner and the staff friendly and eager to please, but everything is made fresh and to your liking

Tell all your friends abt Noi
And don't forget to ask what Noi means if you don't already know!
Great restaurant, and even greater food! The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place! Save room for the desserts! ;-)
the food is phenomenal, the staff is efficient and eager-to-please, the decor is colorful and charming, yet allows the bistro to retain a romantic ambiance
the only problem is they don't have a liquor license yet, so BYOB
this place is one of the best kept secrets in the villiage
In Short Jacques Torres made a name for himself at Le Cirque, creating whimsical chocolate stoves and other ornate creations
He left to open this retail space and chocolate factory, where he sells truffles in flavors like lemon-milk chocolate and "wicked," made with a touch of ancho and chipotle chilis
Visitors shouldn't overlook the croissants, which go mighty well with the stellar, thick "wicked" hot chocolate
I think I'm the only person who hates the hot chocolate here - so thick, it's like a meal in itself
I go for the unique truffle selection
My favorite is the love bug - white chocolate with a key lime center, and also the Chai tea
They have about 30 different ones to choose from, in white, dark, milk chocolate, and new flavors are introduced often
Other yummy treats include chocolate-covered cheerios
And across the street is a wonderful French bakery not to be missed called Almondine
I have probably tried most if not all the hot chocolate places in the city and this is my favorite
It's rich and delicious!
I went looking for vanilla creme chocolates
or coconut cream which were both a no go---they have a non-traditional selection of chocolates, which can be great for non-traditional chocolate lovers
but if you are looking for your favs, this is not the place to go
on the brigth side I did have one of the best chocolate crossaints I have ever tasted
went in with some friends, had a great time

the place was slamming busy, but the staff seemed to have it pretty much under control
The desserts were a little odd, but fun, not your run of the mill fare
i'll be back
It's pricey, but wonderful
Chocolates the size of a silver dollar, and the thickness of three for nearly a dollar apiece, but so, so good
Worth the occasional indulgence
The person behind the counter was also very helpful in describing some of the weirder creations to us in advance
This place has the best chocolate I have ever tasted! I have bought these chocolates for family and friends and they love them
They sell boxes of assorted chocolates you choose
My favorite is one called wicked
They also have the wicked hot chocolate that is the best! The crossiants are great, chocolate dipped fruits nuts, cornflake--they do it all
I tell all my friends about this place becuase it's definitely worth the trip
Its on Water Street behind Grimaldis in Bklyn, so you can you there for L/D and Jacque Torres for dessert!
Jacques Torres is the grand master of all things chocolate, and a trip to this little gem of a store will have all chocoholics rejoicing
Another bonus, he makes the best croissants outside of Paris
The Scene A far cry from the neon-lit formica and kung pao portraiture of cheap Chinese takeout, Penang's outer-borough sister Nyonya is tastefully decorated in exposed brick and shady bamboo
Despite the laid-back decor, the atmosphere's no-nonsense in this always-busy corner boite, where the staff, brisk though never brusque, trade off orders and call each other across the room to ensure that the line out the front never gets too long
The Food Nyonya's menu deftly combines the flavors of China, India and Thailand
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour
Tofu dishes spiced with pork, dried fish and shrimp are particular standouts here, like the spectacularly presented sizzling Nyonya tofu and the double-sauced nyonya lobak
One caveat: Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh
This place basically has the same menu as Penang but everything is cheaper, including the atmosphere
It is worth it for the great taro bowl with seafood and the peanut pancake desserts
Atmosphere isn't as good, but the food is worth it
After reading the Zagat survey, we were very excited to try Nyonya
I have worked in restaurants my whole life and Im very forgiving
My husbands jumbo coconut prawn were terribly greasy and sickenly sweet, so we asked if he could send it back
After sending several different servers to our table, everyone shook their head and said no
They took the shrimp, we still had to pay for the entire dinner, and we left unhappy and hungry
Nobody cared about anything except getting their cash
Dont go!!
The Scene A veritable upscale food court at the doorstep of Bloomingdale's, this space is a dead ringer for a sidewalk cafe in Strasbourg--until you wander upstairs to the sushi bar
Downstairs is for salad-munching shoppers and tourists; the serious eaters can be found above
The Food The menu offers mostly workmanlike fare
Stick to the braised dishes, such as short ribs and Flemish carbonade
On the sushi front, there's always more in the bar's arsenal than the menu reveals
Of the rolls, spicy tuna is gorgeous, but yellowtail with pickled jalapeno is just a reminder that the latter ingredient is better saved for nachos
The occasional self-conscious attempt to turn Japanese, as in smoked salmon with flying fish roe, typically fails
So judging from the other reviews here, I'm not sure if I had a fluke good experience or something, but in any case, I had a really nice lunch with a friend here the other day
Our server was mildly oblivious, but the bussers were really good about keeping our waters refilled
We didn't get bread though
I'm pretty sure that was a mess-up, but it's ok
I had the mixed greens salad with salmon, and both were fresh and tasty
It's just a nice break-from-shopping lunch spot that isn't too expensive and has a cute french twist
But I would recommend it for lunch if you're in the area
I register just to share this review
It is the first time that I am unable to finish my meal
I ordered a risotto that was made with Uncle Ben's white rice, canned mushrooms, and frozen spinach
Just unedible!! My husband was not certain whether his dish was breaded or not despite an unidentifiable layer of something
My friend finished his salad before his dressing arrived after asking for it 3 times in vain
Lastly, if you still plan to waste your money in this place, drink lots of water in your house since it is highly unlikely your glass will ever be refilled
We found The B360 walking along 60th one evening
It smelled great from the street so we got a small table by the window
Service was good( a little hovering but better than being ignored)
The food was only ordinary
The salad special was boring and had way too much oil on the greens and the croque monsieur was soggy(challah does NOT make good CM bread)
The onion soup was the best part of the meal
Not bad but there is definitely better in NYC
i visited this restaurant a while ago but my second experience has convinced me to frequent the place

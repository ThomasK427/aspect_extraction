Best meal for the price I have ever had in NYC
We had 8 adults and a three year old for a mothers day lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon
I am always disappointed with the service when I am with a large group like this, but this time I was totally impressed with the staffs ability to not only be attentive but also have a smile on while the avoided my 3 year old nephew as he bounced around
We had the group special! So much food, I am stuffed now just thinking about it
Salad, pasta tri tasting, Steak, Chicken, Swordfish, Potatos etc
ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!!!!!  $30 a person
AMAZING
We visited Becco last month
Ok, it's 4:30 PM and we're all waiting outside when the door finally opens
We get escorted through one dining where all the waiters and waitresses are being prepped about the nights menu
Myself along with every other patron were forced to wait in an overcrowded bar while employees carry chairs and such over our heads to prepare for dinner in the next room, shoulder to shoulder we stood there like cattle waiting to be fed
Finally we get seated and our underdressed servers commence running around banging and bumping into us as we sit there waiting to be waited upon
I ordered the all you can eat Pasta , These guys are pros at figuring out what you like and making sure you don't get anymore
service sucks!  I have to admit the bathrooms are very nice and clean
Had dinner 4/14 Friday night @ BECCO and was very pleased with the food and service
Ordered the Pasta special and the waiter came around filling and refilling my plate with three different pasta dishes all night long
The atmosphere was pleasant and casually comfortable
I left 15 lbs heavier!
I work in midtown and Becco became our place go to when we wanted to get away from the office and blow it out on the corporate card
The meat lasagne is definatly a choice to go with as is the 3 pasta all you can eat option
I do believe the wine menu is fixed at $20 per bottle, so how can you go wrong with that? The service is great especially sinse they always put up with our antics which usually went on for a few hours and the waiters were always quick to refill our wine glasses
Yes, some of the other patrons might have been put off, but then again others enjoyed our enthusiasm and our wit
We always had a great time and showed up back at the office with our stomachs full and our booze levels above legal driving limits
we had dinner at becco on a friday night, and were seated in the left bar area, which while pretty crowded, had a manageable noise level
the service was attentive and friendly
we ordered the $22 prix fixe which offers choice of caesar salad or grilled vegetables and seafood sampler, and then all-you-can-eat pasta (3 offerings)
the pastas were quite good -- 2 of the 3 were homemade/fresh -- and a decent value
the caesar, however, was ordinary and boring, and the seafood appetizers were mediocre (octopus was fishy and the swordfish bland)
if i were to go again, i'd probably just order off the main menu
nothing to write home about
We just visited Becco restaurant for the second time as I enjoy Lidia's cooking show on TV so much
However, both times we went to the restaurant we had such problems with the seating (with reservations) that it put a damper on our experience
The first time my husband was seated at the top of the stairs practically in front of the bathroom door
The second time we went to Becco, we were brought through the kitchen to our table! This time we were placed at a tiny table right next to the kitchen in the pathway of every waiter/waitress and patron
We were also disappointed in the menu as the only pasta offered were the all you can eat choices of spaghetti and lasagne, not very creative choices
Overall, two very disappointing experiences at a restaurant where I expected to be thoroughly satisfied
A co-worker recommended this place, I had my heart set on it, but my bf forgot to make reservations on the busiest day of the week theatre Wed! I was soooo upset, We went to restuarant row at about 4:30 no reservations and got a sit immediatly! I was so excited, Great pasta made fresh daily, 3 kinds are brought to you unlimited w/ a starter salad
Pasta changes every day- for only $22 bucks that is your best bet! Great wine selections!! I couldn't choose!!! Must do if your in the theatre area! Restrooms are very clean too
I spotted this ristorante while walking through Restaurant Row and became immediately interested since the dinner room was packed
(It's usually a safer bet that the food is good if the restaurant has a full house)
Despite the large 8:30 crowd, we were seated immediately in the charming, quiet back room (recommended)
The menu offers a price fix that includes antipasta or cesear salad, and all-you-can pasta, but I opted for Joe's veal chop, a superb, tender, grilled cut of calf
My friend was also delighted with her selection of the organic chicken
For dessert, we tried the sampler that included small portions of sorbert, chocolate mousse, cheesecake, bread pudding, and custard
All were delicious, but the cheesecake stood out of the group as the best
Overall, I recommend this restaurant, but the service could have been more attentive and polite
I was so excited to try Lidia's restaurant - only to find the trio of pastas overcooked and underinspired
The orrechiette dish was so bitter it was inedible
The 4 cheese pasta was cooked to within an inch of its life
The papardelle was decent but dull - chopped tomatoes seemed the only ingredient
I won't go back
I went to Becco on 10/4/05 with my co-workers
It was a party of 7 and we had a GREAT time
EVERYTHING we ate was absolutely delicious! Since we were a fairly large party, we were recommended the family-style type menu, which included a Ceasar salad, fresh vegetables, unlimited portion of pasta and then steak, chicken and fish (swordfish) as the main entrees
Then for dessert, which was also included in this deal, we had an assortment of all the desserts that are offered
Everything we had was absolutely great
I have been to Becco several times and I have not been disappointed yet
This is definitely a great choice for dinner
The one item I will comment about is the noise
It is usually very loud and sometimes it is a little difficult to hear the waiter, but we just asked him to repeat and we were fine
We had a fantastic meal at Becco's last night
Overall, the dining experience was relaxing and perfect
The antipasto is good, the pastas are fantastic, and the dessert cheese platter is gigantic
The wine was even good considering how inexpensive it is
The service was seemless
Went with spouse and child- here is the scoop: Waiter was attentive and friendly Food was fine- Pastas were good but stuffed pepper portion could have been larger
Wine was good and inexpensive
Chocolate cake good
No childrens menu but were able to accomodate
Great food, but boy can the head waiter be rude! A minor problem over a substitution and the head waiter is accusing us of all manner of things
We had to walk out before any courses were served
Unbelievable
It's cozy, with a feeling like eating at grandma's house, where everything is warm and the company you keep is half the fun! A price fix pasta special allows for a whirlwind of all you can eat pasta
The wine list is priced at the same reasonable price for every bottle of wine
so that you are selecting a WINE that you like rather than a PRICE you want
Entrees are less expensive than most lesser quality restaurants and the restaurant is swarming with service at just the right moment, with people who love a good time as much as you do
Accomodations are available for those who are heading off to the theatre, as well
So book in advance, enjoy the meal, and the show
And after the show, head back for a nightcap and choose from their extensive list which includes a dozen varieties of grappa! ****
We had a lovel meal before the theatre here
We did have to wait for our table despite having a reservation but the food was excellent and the wait staff attentive
I would definatley go there again and being in the theatre district they were sensitive to our time constraints
I haven't had the pasta, but the appetizers, salads, and entrees (especially the steak and lamb) are extraordinary
The steak is marinated in a secret concoction of mushrooms and spices and it's one of the best I've ever had
I enjoy having a seat at the bar (where you can order from the full menu) and letting the excellent sommelliers recommend wines with each course
The $25 list of bottles is superb, and everyone there is friendly and professional
If it was a tad less pricey, I'd eat there every week
I've eaten here at least 3 times, and have even thrown a party in their garden room! The pastas are delicious and do not miss the dessert sampler
I have been dissapointed with the lemon chicken, thoughm as it was very dry
Overall, the service is friendly but I would recommend avoiding the 'pre theater' sitting if you would like to relax and really taste the food
The table anti pasto is great!
I go to the theatre often and with so many restaurants in NYC I like to try a different one each time, however, my companion wanted to eat at Becco again
You can't beat the value of the Pre Fixe and the Under $25 wine list is great! The pasta is always hot and fresh and NEVER soggy
My friend is a vegetarian and one of the pastas featured last time had meat in it so what did the staff do? They brought her a primavera! The staff is most accomadating and always friendly knowledgeable
They get you in and out without missing the curtain or feeling rushed in any way
Brava Lidia, etal
ENCORE!
And we thought the food was great
We had kids and seniors at the table
They serve family style so it was more than enough for all

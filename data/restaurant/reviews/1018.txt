We had to find him for desert, more drinks and our check
Also, they were out of half the items on the menu
Sorry to read some of you having such a bad time at Bivio
It certainly pays to make a reservation! The place is slammed, but the vibe is friendly and hospitable
Once seated the food was simple, great
loved selecting the plate of prosciutto and marinated fennel and cheese
Pasta was wonderful
we had ravioli with sea bass
I am a neighbor and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the crowd
Definitely a neighborhood place I will go to again and again
They are consistent
We (4) seated ate 7pm and half the specials are gone
who ate them all? The staff? Waiting for our check (8:30pm) and the manager/maitre'd asked us to wait at the bar
Unheard of!!! I am wrong
I read it in another review (2/6/04)
It will soon inplode
and for good reason(s)
Say good bye
My friend and I dropped in on a Wednesday night without a reservation and we were told that they could seat us in about an hour and to have a seat and wait at the bar
After over an hour the hostess came over and told us she would not be able to seat us afterall
Why did they take our name in the first place? Plus the bartender was totally overwhelmed and rude
After we were told we couldn't be seated, it took 20 more minutes to close our bar tab
HORRIBLE
DO NOT GO TO BIVIO
i really enjoyed this place
The vibe is great
Downtown and alive
The food is simple but in that way was really delicious
we started with bruschetta made with baby tomatoes and perfect olive oil
then spinach/cheese ravioli
it was all excellent
It was just me and my boyfriend, and bivio was perfect
it felt fun but still somewhat romantic
the large round tables by the bar looked fun for a bigger group
the waiter was attentive
the wine was very good
the bill was totally reasonable
i would definitely go back again, this would be a regular place for me
I had a dinner party with 14 guests at Bivio this past weekend and it was fantastic
They have a prix fixe menu that made ordering totally effortless
the food and wine were simply wonderful and really well priced
the ambiance is lively and fun
the service was outstanding
i was really impressed, we had such a great time
this is great place just for 2, or for a large group
intimate and delicious!
from start to finish, this is by far the worst restaurant experience i've had in years
the host didn't acknowledge us for sometime and then he simply pointed to our table
we order martinis but they've run out of ketel one
who runs out of ketel one? and yes there is a blackboard full of specials, unbelievably, they were out of EVERY special and every fish dish (and the presentation was awful)
finally, onto dessert, wherebv the waiter told us he would have to scrape the bottom to give us any ice cream
i knew as soon as we sat down that we should cut our losses and get outta there
oh well
My friend recommended BIVIO to me, so I called and tried to make a reservation, but the night was booked
The maitre'd recommended me trying to walk in
So I walked into the restaruant without any reservation, we were told that we could sit around the bar area, so we wait for 20 mins to get the bar area seats
The food is so delicious, and restaurant has greate vibe, bartender is friendly
I had a wonderful time
I will definately yo go back with a group of people next time
It is worthed to wait for
Food was very good, at reasonable prices, although desserts were a bit disappointing
Wine is fairly priced
Despite the good food/price, it wasn't a great experience
Our waiter appeared at our table twice all night
Fortunately another waiter noticed that we were not getting much service, and did most of the work for our absent waiter
It is also bit crowded and a lot loud
Bivio was a wonderful surprise
The food was very good, at reasonable prices
The pasta was cooked to perfection, wonderfully flavored, etc
etc
I highly recommend this restaurant!
Last night at Bivio, I experienced a level of rudeness beyond any other dining experience I have ever had
We were waiting for the waiter to collect the check, WITH the credit cards sticking out, when the manager/maitre'd approached
He asked us if we could GET UP AND SIT AT THE BAR, because he needed the table
Who does that? We arrived on time for our reservation and by no means were dragging the evening out
Even if we were, this is an unbelievable request
I don't care if this place was giving away free meals, I would never give them the satisfaction of returning business again
From the owners of Bottino comes Bivio
Danny Emmerman does it right again - a new restaraunt in the West Village
Very similar in style and substance as Bottino, Bivio comes across as a real neighborhood restaraunt
Food is good, ambiance is wonderful
Same crowd as Bottino although it definitely has more of a local feel
Can get crowded and they do need to iron out a few kinks, but it is definitely worth a visit
Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had! It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick! Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch! Highly Highly Highly recommended!
I finally got a chance to experience the quality of good food,no great food that everyone should try,after getting off at Fort Hamilton exit everyday of my life always saying i am going to try that pizzeria with the adorable kid in on the sign i am astonished at the superb and taste of just about everything i have tried so far that's #1 Pizza,chicken cutlet parm and my favorite chicken Marsala no one can seem to get it correctly but this place seemed to perfect its kinda surreal highly,highly,highly recomennded
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I've found little toninos
I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher
Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it
Worth making the trip down to Kensington for
really!
Tonino's took over from the adorable but empty Brooklyn Egg Cream Co
countertop corner joint and, at first, we were sad
But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual)
Obviously run by folks who know a pie
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv
The Scene  After entering through a rather ordinary front door, turn the corner to descend a down a flight of stairs into a subterranean space that is--literally--cavernous
Once adjusted to the dim lighting, you'll behold imported rocks that cover every inch of the walls, stalactites, fossil imprints, a gurgling fountain and, naturally, a DJ setup
After a couple glasses of wine, you might think you've stumbled into the underground city from the "Matrix" movies

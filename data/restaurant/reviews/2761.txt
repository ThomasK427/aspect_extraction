Their servers have all been there for a long time and work to take great care of you
Can't get any better than that rotisserie chicken
Worth a trip from NYC to have great peruvian food in this cute atmosphere
This restaurant has a different ambiance than most places in park slope
The service was 4 star quality and the food was outstanding
Every time I go to Tonio's the food is delicious and Tony and his staff are always friendly and accommodating
I grew up in Park Slope and have seen the rise of more pretensious, less food and service oriented establishments
Tonio's is always great
and the large window looking over the garden helps to create an intimate experience
I will continue to come here
My g/f and I walked in one night, the owner greeted us at the door and took our coats, sat us in the back room (non-smoking at the time)
The wait staff (all latin at an italian restaurant) was very nice and attentive, multiple to our table
The food was good and the prices were reasonable
We've been back
Dress nice/casual and enjoy
My date and I were both taken back by the lack of the friendly attitude from the owner of the restaurant
The prices could be a bit more reasonable if they wouldn't charge $10 for a small cappucino and a 'out-of-the freezer' teramisu!
The boiled 1/2 chicken with rice and beans is among the best Spanish food prepared in the city
I have tried other delicious items on the menus but always go back for the fresh and simply prepared comfort of the chicken, rice and beans--very filling while light and tasty
If you are feeling adventurous try the octopus salad, it is amazing also
WE ONLY WENT THERE ONCE
THE ZUCCHINE FLOWERS WERE EXCELLENT
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO FOR BRUNCH
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOOD
THE SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD, NOT GREAT, BUT I HATE WHEN THEY STAND OVER YOU AND THEY GAVE US AMPLE TIME TO ENJOY OUR MEAL WITHOUT BOTHERING US
OVERALL, I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK
Though a little pricey for take out, I was very happy with my order from 12th Street
The food took approximately 20 minutes to be prepared
We had the tuna steak sandwich, the crab cake appetizer and the endive/arugula salad
The tuna was delicious, as were the accompanying homemade potato chips
The crab cake was equally satisfying
As for the salad, it was fresh and good, but nothing too special
I'm looking forward to sitting down there soon, as the interior was very attractive
No need to be down on the 12th street
Just because the bar is so-so is no reason to get down on a very good restaurant
Get the mussels
They are very good
You'll have to get extra bread to sop up the sauce
The tuna steak sandwich is also very good
We've always had great servers and a great time
A very good place for a quiet dinner with someone you like
We visited the 12th Street Grill during Dine-In Brooklyn week
Even the 19
55 prix fixe menu was appetizing
However, that is the end of the positives
It took an hour for our first course to arrive and the server blamed it on the kitchen
She probably forgot we were sitting there as she was extremely busy socializing with her coworkers
The meal itself was not very good, either
The swordfish was slimy and tasteless, the artichoke was bland and the strawberries had nearly gone bad
We expected during Dine-In Brooklyn food would be of lower quality than on an ordinary night, but they surpassed even our lowest expectations
Lastly, our server's shift must have ended and she failed to notify us that she was leaving
We were passed on to an equally incompetent server who forgot my husband's dessert
Overall, a very bad experience
I hate the bar half of this establishment
I live across the street from it
12th Street attracts the most obnoxious frat trash
The staff certainly don't have much of a good neighbor policy in keeping the noise down or keeping drunk patrons from pissing on neighboring buildings
Even better, they've started having live music until about 1 a
m
every Tuesday! (The band is positioned in front of the windows, in a space roughly the size of a living room
)
This place has gone straight down hill
I went on a Tuesday night and have never had such poor service or been treated so badly in a place where I am spending my hard-earned money
I used to love this place but unless there are some serious changes I can't see myself ever returning
Unless you enjoy paying for watered down, over-priced for Brooklyn swill served by openly apathetic and/or abusive, psycho-Nazi bartenders in a dive environment full of obvious losers then you should take your business elsewhere
There are far too many great places in Brooklyn to bother with this rathole
Simply put - IT SUCKS !!! First and last visit !
For basically a bar, this place has great food -- the homemade potato chips are awesome! And the ambience is very cool, stop by on a Saturday afternoon and you can play some old school games while having a beer
I've been going here since they opened
One of the best brunches in town
I must admit, I'm a bit bored with the menu because I've been there so many times
Nice, varied, consistant menu and service
Reasonably priced and reasonable wine list
The only thing bad is that it's so consistant!! Sometimes you have to wait, but at least they are friendly! Top 10 Park Slope
Don't listen to anyone who says it's bland or snobby (ha!), MAYBE I wouln't travel across the river for it, but it is certainly worth checking out!
Nothing too splashy, but good food, and consistant quality
The seafood is fresh, and if all else fails, the burgers are great
good small bar with good friendly bartenders with excellent music taste, some days a nice Virginan works
Great food, made in the restaurant next door is brought over, so you get a nice small bar with great food
Sometimes the sports bar thing starts to takeover, but with more artsy people movin in, that will change
Its ok for a local joint but the food is very boring seems to be churned out without innovation
Been twice in the last couple of weeks felt let down, it looks like it should be better the service is pretty good
Maybe it's because I'm lazy (I live on the same block) but I can't get enough of this place
The food is amazing, we usually get great service, and the prices (especially the amazing Sunday brunch) are very reasonable
I have yet to find a better restaurant in Brooklyn
bland food, discourteous staff, somehow this restaurant is truly park slope
first and last time patron
The space is definitely a step up from the overcrowded, overtchotchked digs on Seventh Avenue, and the staff's more than accommodating to students and others hanging out for hours on the strength of a single cuppa, which give is a nice vibe
But the coffee's unspectacular -- generally tastes like the beans are stale -- and the nuked food less than inspiring
I'm a huge fan of their vanilla hazelnut coffee, and my boyfriend loves their cappucino
Their yogurt breads are very good, but I wasn't impressed with their sandwiches
The employees are very friendly and remember the regulars, but some of the clientele are highly annoying and make me feel sorry the employees have to deal with them! I wish Windsor Terrace had an indie coffee place, but CT Muffin will do
:)
Great service and great vanilla chai
However, to go containers of make it yourself powdered chai pricey!!! 12
50 for 12 ounce can
Nice guys work there and the coffee's good and it's not quite Starbucks (but it wishes it were)
Still, I'd prefer a real neighborhood joint to snag that great location
Great for after the dog park caffeine
God-awful bagels

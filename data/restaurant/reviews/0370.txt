A fifteen minute walk from my Times Square hotel got me out of the crowds and away from the tourist prices
I had the Pad Key Mao (spelling from menu) and a Thai Iced Tea
Yummy! Level of spice was just right
Not too much seating, so you might want to get there early or late for dinner
Don't miss it if you're walking North on 9th Ave
It's on the southwest corner, but not the corner store, just further west
Cash only
make sure you've got enough! My wife and I ate for $21 including tip
I have to agree with all of the others -- I just came across this place yesterday, even though I have lived in the neighborhood for years and I am so so happy
This is the best thai food I have had in in the city
I am very picky and I actually called a bunch of my friends today to tell them how good it was
The bonus is that it is cheap and the staff is very friendly
My friend lives around the corner from this place and went here often and I can now see why! The place itself is ok - nothing fancy
But the food is SO good and inexpensive
It's incredible that you can find a place like this in NYC
This is somewhere to go for cheap good food, not a date or with anyone that you're really trying to impress
Some of the reviews for Pam make it sound as if the atmosphere weren't that nice
The ambiance isn't luxurious, but it is quite pleasant, and the service is warm and courteous
And, of course, the food is delicious
We are so lucky to live so close to such a great Thai place


never eaten there but their take-out service is SO quick!! I highly recommend
With so much competition from other Thai restaurants in the area, Pam certainly holds its own
May not be the best but definitely up there
Food is mouthwatering delicious
Definitely not Americanized in any way
Service is friendly although the decor is your typical hole-in-the-wall look
Try the anchovies fried rice
actually pretty good
The anchovies are not the pungent Italian kind which some people do not like (I actually love them!)
If you are looking for a simple place to relax and have good home style Thai food, try going to Pam's
I've visited there on several occasions, usual for dinner and the place has always been packed with nice customers
What I am not crazy about is the Tom-Yam-Goong (Thai hot and sour soup)
Tom-yam (expecially home style Tom-Yam) is typically spicey and very herbally, aromatic, full of kaffir leaves and smell of sour lemongrass
Pam's version is rather dull
But try the Duck curry and Crispy Pork with Chinese broccoli
Both very affordable and very tasty
A cheap and no-frills place for Thai food
Simply the best Thai food I've ever had in the city
the duck was a little tough, but everything else I've eaten has been fab-- and cheapity cheap! Not to mention the fact that it's BYOB
No ambience, but who cares???
The Scene Seasonal ales and tasty classic microbrews are poured at the spit-shined bars of this midtown tourist magnet
Since the average wait for a table equals one beer--if not two, without reservations--there's plenty of time to sample the pale, smooth Harvest Wheat with a slice of lemon or the tawny Red Rooster with a frothy head
Table service is speedy, but doesn't encourage lingering
The Food The menu, like much of the crowd, hails from America's heartland
For apps, try the cheeses paired with house beers, the blue-cheese nachos or creamy spinach dip
Burgers are served tall and deliciously gooey with bacon, Swiss and good fries, but steaks and pastas fall short of satisfying
Heartland's heart lies in its brews, and the time-honored pub-grub that goes with them
The Buffalo steak is only $17
95 which is pretty good considering its decent size
Side dishes don't come with the entrees, except for potato, but don't order one unless you're with a giant group
We got creamed spinach which was extremely light and fresh, but the portion could have fed 6-8 people
My girlfriend and I had visited the restaurant in the Empire State Building
The beer was great and service was excellent
The food was good and came immediately after we ordered it, but the portions weren't all that large
My favorite beer was the Indian River Light
very tasty
the stout was also excellent
If you are looking for a sit down place to have your beer and a couple of appetizers -- Heartland is the place
My personal favorite is the mini burgers and a pint of their seasonal beer (do not order the calamari)
My guest had the meatloaf and enjoyed himself
So if you are looking to avoid the lines at Olive Garden and a bar style environment pick Heartland
The restaurant on 14 Street has more of an after work atmosphere it is always crowded at the bar
So if you are looking to rub elbows with suits, the 14th Street location is your place
I love Heartland Brewery
It is very nice looking, not particularly fancy, but a classic steakhouse look
The booths are spacious and comfortable
I've never had to wait for a table and I've never had a bad dining experience there
Nothing on the menu is very pricey, especially for the city
The buffalo chicken spring rolls are fantastic, so is the fried calamari
Great pre-theater menu
Every waiter/waitress I've had there has been on the ball
There is a variety of beers and you can get a sampler of 5 of them if you can't make up your mind
If you're looking to go out somewhere that won't empty your wallet and will fill you up, this is a great restaurant
I recently dined at the Heartland Brewery in Times Square and encountered something I thought I never would with a restaurant in NYC
People who care!! First let me say, the food was great
I had the Ribeye steak which was just terrific
This place is known for their beer and it was also great
But what stood out the most was what happened at the end of the meal
My wife wanted to go out for Jazz and I did not know where to go
A gentleman offered his help
He turned out to be the General Manager Carl Clements (as noted on his card)
He was EXTREMELY helpful and guided us to a great Jazz club
He actually took the time seaching for the exact club she wanted to go to
I would definately recommend this place
Great food, servcie and great management!!
I would NEVER eat at this place again
Positively my worst dining experience in New York
As if the rubbery chicken (perfect for a teething puppy) and dried out bacon wasn't enough, the service was awful
It took us 20 minutes to get the ice water we asked for and then another 10 for the straw and then another 5 for the lemon wedges
My first and last experience at Heartland Brewery
After going to the top of the Empire State Building, I went next door to the Heartland Brewery (350 5th Ave
at 34th Street)
I was very suprised to see there was really no wait
We were seated within 5 minutes
Our waiter did not show up till 15 minutes later
He wasn't very helpful with the menu and took forever to get drinks and food
I ordered the lemon pepper half chicken with mashed potatoes
It was very good and I was extremely happy that is what I picked

The place is tiny but comfortable
Service is great
Highly recommended
My wife and I stumbled upon Florencia 13 purely by accident
Little did we know that it would end up being our home away from home in NYC
I grew up and have lived in the Los Angeles area for 35 years
Take it from me, a true Southern California native, the food at Florencia 13 is the real deal, real Southern California style Mexican food
The margaritas are the best that I've ever had, make sure that you order it flaming
The thing that I most enjoy about this restaraunt is the cool vibe and the hospitality given to us by the owners
I highly recommend Florencia 13, the food is great, the margaritas are the best, and the cool vibe, So Cal style, and the hospitality is the best
Make sure you stop by here and don't forget, order your margarita flaming ;)
As a Southern California native I was really taken aback by the LACK OF GOOD Mexican food restaurants in NYC
until I came upon FLORENCIA 13 by chance one day on my first visit to the city
Let me just say that after a week in NYC I was starting to feel a bit home sick for the Los Angeles area and FLORENCIA 13 was like a little piece of home away from home
The food REALLY IS Southern California style Mexican food and it's to die for
The ambiance is cozy and relaxed, the owners are friendly and made us feel right at home
You have to try the margaritas as they are the best I've ever tasted just about anywhere! If you haven't been here yet
SHAME ON YOU! DROP WHAT YOU'R DOING AND GO NOW! ;-)
If you are looking for authentic SoCal Mexican cuisine than you must try Florencia 13
Run, don't walk
I'm serious
The food is that good! I've been living in the city for about 4 years now and this is the first time I have ever found a place that mirrored the quality of the incredible Mexican restaurants in Southern California
I had the Fish Tacos and the only way to describe them was WOW
Thank you Ralph, Rena, and family for bringing this amazing restaurant to the west village
I'll be back again and again and again!
Real East and South L

mexican food has finally made it's way to NYC
It must have been old home night during our visit on a Friday evening in April, but a good majority of the restaurant patrons were visiting from or L
A
transplants
This was a real sign that Florencia 13 was truly an authitic west coast mexican joint
Who else would know better? The food was outstanding in full L
A
effect and the margaritas are huge, served in a pint glasses and were very tasty
Owners Ralph, Rena and thier kids were gracious hosts and make the dining experience complete
Some may complain about the prices, but get real everything in New York is expensive
Have you ever bought an avocado there? I found the prices to be reasonalbe considering the quality and hope that they consider opening a store on the west coast sometime in the future
Another So Cal now New Yorker who thinks this is the best Mex around
Good food, Great Margaritas and the service is so far above par for Soho/Village
Always a good scene and a friendly vibe like no other
Can you tell I like this place
Been there many a time and will continue to drink the East LA Margarita
Feliz Cinco de Mayo
I must say Florencia 13 makes the best burritos i've ever had
I recomend the East LA Burrito wet with tomatillo and the fish tacos are my new addiction
I am in constant search of good tequilla and tasty margaritas
I was in last Friday and Chalkie made me the best margarita I'd ever had east of the Mississippi
I met Ralph and Rena,the couple that own my new favorite Mexican joint and they are the nicest people in NYC
I plan on coming back for dates and when my mom(from Texas) is in town
Keep up the good work and don't forget I'm down for a tasty Flaming Florencia Margarita next time I'm in
Being from Claremont I was happy to find food that tastes like home
The fish tacos are excellent but I would avoid the Flautas as they are usually too burnt or greasy
I recomend sitting at the bar to eat, as it can take forever to get a seat and I've had both waitresses mix up my drink orders
The margaritas are going to cost you, but are very tasty if you happen to catch the right bartender ( Leonard and the girl with the tattoos seem to know what they're doing)
The family that runs Florencia is nice and I usally have a great time
I just wish the prices were like back home
I've dined in some very fine places, and this was not one of them
I don't know where all of these other reviewers came from - maybe from S
Cali? I am not familiar with Mexican food there, so perhaps it is authentic, but I am familiar with Mexican food from Mexico and this was nothing like it
The ingredients, especially the cheese, were sinfully low-grade and generic
The plates looked unappetizing and were incredibly scant for the price
On the up-side - the ambiance and service were nice and the margaritas were definitely good - but you'll pay for it - and most margaritas are good if you use top-shelf tequila
1 appetizer + 2 a la carte entres + 2 drinks = $53 (and I didn't leave full)
As if it wasn't enough that New York City is a great city, it has been blessed with Florencia 13
Coming from Los Angeles, California, I attended NYU and stayed in Greenwhich village this past summer (05)
While there, one night I decided to take a walk
While doing so, to my amazment from afar I saw the face of a pachuco dislpayed on a red banner
I entered the establishment and I was welcomed by Lenard
I have to say that Lenard and his family are amazing people, and all those who work there as well
Now, my GOD!!! The food, was to die for
I felt as if I was back in East Los specifically
The tacos, the burritos, and the gucamole, just amazing
The drinks are great too
When you are there, ask for the Lenard Special (mixed drink), mention George from UCLA recommended it
My fellow Chicanos found their way to NYC! This is the first restrant in NYC that serves great food like they do back in East L
A
The food is absolutely authentic and fresh, furthermore the drinks are delicious and one of a kind
The owners are genuine people who make you feel at home and always bring a smile to your face
THANK YOU for finally bringing the closest thing to my mothers dishes to the city!
Good mojitos but nothing too crazy
It was good but I've had better
Prices were average, food was good but the place is super small
SUPER small
b
I live half a block from this place and happened to stagger in there by chance on a random saturday night
WOW
the food is incredible
Extremely fresh ingredients, great tasting, totally amazing mexican
Great place to eat if you're on a budget
And best of all, they're open late!
It was like being home! The food and service was above and beyond anything I had ever experienced
You must visit this place if your ever in New York, don't pass it! Don't pass up the Flaming Margarita!
Finally! Really authentic Mexican food in New York City
it has taken awhile for me to find a place in New York with Mexican food that actually tastes the way that it should and this restaurant goes above and beyond that
The al Pastor tacos are to die for and their margaritas are phenomenal! Florencia 13 has quickly become my favorite local restaurant and the place I make all of my friends go to
for a bite, for a drink, for a meal, for whatever
This place is an amazing find
I stopped by after work for snack and drink
I am do plan on coming back, it was one of the best burritos I've had outside of texas

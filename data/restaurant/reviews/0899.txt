Then we were seated at this somewhat isolated table and were thankful because every other table seemed cramped
Oh, but that didn't last long
We were asked to move ourselves (with our drinks and chips) to a another table because the one we were at was reserved
At this point we were totally disgusted and cramped
The tables are so close together you have no choice but to strike up a conversation with the strangers next to you
We complained to the manager and he offered to move us (nope, no discount)
We order the special (seafood stuffed red snapper) and aseafood rice dish, which were nothing special
I would never send anyone to this place
I agree with the other poster who wrote about the service: the waiter challenged every single dish we ordered with a special (I've never had a more money hungry waiter) and after waiting 20 minutes for the check we had to call the manager over; who was unapologetic
Food was ok; but overpriced and the drinks and deserts are severely overpriced; $10 for 1 scoop of sorbet
Sorry Mama; never again!!
My friend and I went here for dinner the other week and had a great time! Yea the mariachi band at first was a tad annoying, but after a few margaritas, I thought I was in Mexico in no time! I was very pleased with my food and so was my friend, I'd go back definitely! Service was prompt also!
Two good friends and I just enjoyed a very enjoyable meal at Mama Mexico
We are all food aficionados and were pleasantly surprised with the great service, the great food, and the best guacamole we've ever tasted
Even more exciting, was the fact they made the guacamole fresh to order right at the table
The sangria was also very pleasant and the decor was quite festive
Not only was the waiter rude and inattentive, the clearer spilled food on both myself and my girlfriend
I was with a group of 4 and we decided to split 2 fajita orders between the 4 of us
They only brought out 6 tortillas, 1 of which was taken away because they cleared the table too quickly, and then charged us $2
50 for 3 more tortillas
THEN they wanted to charge us $5 for salsa because we had gone through 3 of their SHALLOW bowls
All in all the worst experience I've had at a restaurant
Don't believe the ratings
I went to Mama Mexico for a friend's surprise birthday party, and although the atmosphere was festive, I can say that the food was below average at best
Mama Mexico is crowded; a mariachi band ensures that the noise level is always high to almost intolerable, and the lights that change color every few minutes became more than a slight nuisance
The hostess would not seat us until our entire party was there (only two people were missing out of the 15 of us!)
The service was above average; our waitress was kind and helpful
My chimichangas were both dry and not very tasty; my boyfriend's seafood dish was relatively average
Other than the guacamole, I would say there's not much reason to go back
I'm not sure there is tequila in the margaritas here
What I was served was a terribly sweet icey artificially fruit flavored frozen something
It was terrible
We sat at the bar and after 4 other parties arrived, the staff brought out chips and salsa - serving us last
Terrible drinks, terrible food
What a disappointment! I had heard that this place was great, but the service was atrocious
Although there were tons of open tables, the waiter wanted to seat us right on top of the only other party there
Then, we discovered that not ordering guacamole for your table is tantamount to asking the wait staff to roll their eyes at you and then ignore you during your entire meal (I had to eventually go to the front of the restaurant to ask for our check)
And the food didn't make up for the bad service
Boring, sub-par, and overpriced
We'll never go back!
Well
Well
Went for my 21st bday dinner with four of my friends
Loved it
Best mexican food you can get on the east coast
Real south western style
Little crowded
Great in the summer
Make guacomole at your table to your specifications
THE BEST
I highly recommend this place
LOVE this place, sooooo good
Yummy food, entertaining atmosphere
It is tight quarters but where in NYC isn't
It is def
worth it
I took my family and they made us laugh and gave us free Pinapple infused shots of tequila at the end of the meal
And the tableside prepared guacamole was pure heaven!!!!!!!! I want to go back immediately!
If you want good food, fresh guacamole at a reasonable price, this is the place to go
This is not a 'date spot' because the seating can be cramped and the tables are too small, but, it is definitely a great place to go and meet friends
I had the filet mignon fajita and it was fabulous
The meat was perfectly prepared and went great with the tequila martini I had
Yum yum!
Move over MAYA
MAMA MEXICO is the best Mexican restaurant now
You can pick any thing on the menu and not go wrong
Food is tasty, portions are good, and the staff is great
Trust me you will not be dissappointed
The place is very nice, great decor but if you want real mexican food, then this is not the place for you
Overly priced entrees, not the best taste
Went once and will definitely not go again
You'll find better places in NYC, so skip this one
I recently went to Mama Mexico for a birthday and had an awful time
Their menu is incredibly overpriced and their service is fair
Besides the price, here are some other annoyances: bleaching the floors during the dinner and automatically charging you 20% gratuity on your credit card without your knowledge
Buyer beware
Taco Bell serves better food
Four of us stopped in for a few drinks before reservations at another establishment
We sat at the bar and had some of the best service
There were a great many tequilas to choose from, and they were very willing to make me a margarita the way I like it
They also had a pineapple infused tequila, it was amazing! We'll definitely go back and try some dinner if their bar staff is any indication of the whole
If you do not expect much from your dining experience, but enjoy - or do not mind - paying a hefty tab for what ever is placed in front of you, please go to Mama Mexico
This IS Tex-Mex, and would not be worth compliment at half the price
If you order Margaritas get it frozen; In the event there is little or low grade alcohol, at least you will get 'brain freeze
' I do not mind paying for quality
I ordered the $17
00 enchiladas (3 w/rice,beans)not concerned about the price, but for god-sakes make some effort
There is better
Alot better!
Took a long time to get seated even with reservations
Not the best date place since it is very loud and table are super close together
But the food was delicious and the service excellent
Great place to go for a b-day or other group occasion
Wonderful fresh and innovative mexican food
Order teh guacamole and watch them prepare it table side
Brightly lit and lots of fun, it is good place after work, with friends
I've bemoaned for years the lack of good mexican food in New York - not TexMex, but good solid, authentic Mexican fare
Then I was introduced to Mama Mexico and fell in love! I've been to both the 49th street location (stylish, great for a date) and the Broadway one (more family style, homey) and, while the atmosphere is noticeably different, the service and the food is identical
Fresh guacamole made right at your table, to your specifications; excellent sangria, fantastic food! You will not be disappointed, or go home hungry - and please don't skip dessert! I don't what I enjoyed more - the dulce de kahlua, the banana burritos, or the creme brulee!
What a night, great food and margaritas on the rear patio surrounded by lots of plants, flowers and twinking lights

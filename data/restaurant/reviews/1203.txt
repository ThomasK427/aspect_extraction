I've had brunch here two weeks in a row and both times it's been great
1st time I had the eggs benedict eggs
The poached eggs were done perfect, the sauce was great and the cibatta toast it was served on was delicious
Second time I had Crabcakes benedict, again everything was done right
The white bread toast was crispy, but not hard and explodes in your mouth with texture and flavor
The crabcakes were some of the best I've had
They had a wonderful sweet crab flavor and no annoying shells like many crabcakes
Keep it up!
We went there last night to celebrate my husband's birthday
The food, service and ambiance (except they MUST change that dreadful music) was great
The food was delicious
And the staff was so sweet, especially when our younger daughter knocked over a glass of red wine! She was so embarrassed but the staff was so sweet, they brought her cookies later
The food is really good, we shared the rib eye and it was done perfectly!! Wonderfully spiced with some rosemary
Highly recommended and a great addition to the Park Slope restaurant scene!
Had a good time last night at Stone Park
I heard good things and decided to try it with my parents
Place was nice, warm, and inviting
Everyone was friendly
Only complaint was that the food took awhile to arrive but they made up for it by comping us with appetizers of fried oysters (delicious) and foie gras (sweeter than I like but excellent nonetheless)
All four entrees were excellent
My scallops were buttery, the short rib special was moist and delicious, the rib eye steak was suprisingly great, and the newport steak sandwich was tender and tasty
Prices were reasonable and dessert clinched the deal
good work
I'll be back
This place is amazing! The food was absolutely delicious
We had paella valenciana (highly recommended) and the fish special which was a trout stuffed with seafood
The fish was so tender, flaky and delicate and the portions all around were very hearty
To top it off, the service was impeccable! Very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable
Add to all of this simple yet aesthetically pleasing decor wonderful atmosphere, and you have a wonderful restaurant that's definitely worth the trip out to Brooklyn Heights
This was one of the best Spanish resturants I've gone to, definetly the best in Brooklyn
The food was awesome and with fairly large portions
Glad I found this place in such a great area with lots of fun bars nearby
Didn't want to go in, but my boyfriend wanted to try it out
Having never had spanish food before I was pleasantly surprised
The flavors, the wonderful servers, the fun! My boyfriend said the food authentic and after our night at La Manch we tried several other spanish restaurants in NYC
No other spanish restaurant compares
This is the way a restaurant should be run
Great friendly service, they treat you like part of the family
The food is outstanding, try the altar boys! It is a great place to hang out at, even for a drink or two
I will eat here as much as I can
First rate service and food, sans pretention
Highly recommend this to any homesick Spaniards, or fans of this cuisine; I expect this will become a routine stop on my dining out agenda
in 1605 miguel de cervantes write don quijote 400 hundreds years later 2 young couple create LA MANCHA RESTAURANT , a special place with a delicius food from spain ,very good service romantic and close to manhattan
NEVER EAT IN A PLACE LIKE MY HOME THE SERVICE IS IN FRONT OF YOUR TABLE,ALWAYS HAVE A WAITER,ASKING IF I NEED ANYTHING,NEVER MISSED WATER,WINE OR SODA,THE FOOD WAS 110 % DELICIUS,THEY TAKE THE TIME FOR MAKE ME COMFORTABLE LIKE IN MY OWN HOME,THE PRICE FOR THAT DINER WAS NORMAL NO HIDING PRICE,EVERITHING WAS EXCELENT MY REVIEW IS 1 TO 10 ,,10 FOR SERVICE, QUALITY OF FOOD AND FRIENDSHIP THANK YOU FOR A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT
I checked this place out during the blizzard, and was thrilled to discover the $12 early bird price fixe (until 6:30 PM) -- appetizer, entree, dessert, and soda
The food was solid, especially for the price, though the regular prices weren't as big a bargain, and it's not as good as Joya overall
Walking down Bleecker with a couple of friends and happened upon Caffe Del Mare
The outdoor seating was inviting so we took a chance
and glad we did
Great place to sit, drink and people watch
The service was courteous and our food was served in a timely manner
We also shared a couple of desserts which were excellent
cool place!
Couldn't find a place for dinner in West Village, my friends and I spotted this lovely place serving Italian at the corner of MacDougal and Bleeker
The waiter was somewhat friendly
For drinks, I asked for a glass of Sangria, but it wasn't available as the Sangria only serve in Pitcher so I ended up getting a regular cocktail
For food, I ordered Ossobuco, which turned out to be horrible
The meat was extremely tough and was undercooked (I eat rare for steak and still think it is undercooked)
I asked the waiter to re-cook the veal, but the toughness of the meat didn't change
I personally can't see anyone eating that dish (and went as far as thinking that the chef must have made a mistake cooking it)
I ended up wasting $24 on the most expensive dish on the menu
In addition, three homeless people came up and ask for money during my dinner
Honestly, one of the worst experience ever
Went here after walking up down Bleecker trying to decide where to go
We settled on Caffe del Mare because it looked warm and inviting
The staff was friendly and attentive
The food was served hot and fresh and the desserts were delicious
We did very well here considering we hadn't planned on going
The tuna was cooked correctly; rare
It's difficult to make extremely rare tuna dry (i
e
sushi is not dry)
This tuna was so dry and tasteless, it was like eating alien flesh from another planet
The vegetables were dry shriveled brocolli
The $9 glass of wine which the waitress called good was like grape juice with alcohol and no sugar
My girlfriend felt bad for the poor salmon that had to die and not be eaten
It's difficult to make smoked salmon as fishy as this, but like the alien tuna, the chefs managed to do the impossibly bad
It was slimy and smelly
The pasta sauce was bland, which was a relief in that somehow the salmon didn't transfer it's taste to the sauce
Their beer selection didn't include Italian beers (Corona bottle, $6
50)   The calamari frita tasted like it was bought frozen at the grocery store and baked
My friends and I were walking along Bleecker Street and randomly chose Cafe Del Mar for brunch
It was such a beautiful day that we sat at one of their outdoor tables
This was a great choice because it was a perfect place to watch the foot traffic along this historic stretch of road in Greenwich Village
As far as the brunch food, it was served fast, fresh and with a smile
We also had a drink with our meal and it was very tasty
We'll be back to try lunch or dinner
Ok, so NYC isn't recommended for its service but this was bad
After waiting nearly 40 minutes for bacon and eggs we were greeted with one plate of bacon - cold
Then about 10 minutes later the eggs came - luke warm
Then we had to ask for butter for the toast
It was a shambles from start to finish
Even when all of the ingrediants arrived it was poor
It was a shame as it looked very nice from the outside but the experience was not good, maybe its ok as a bar but avoid eating there
the food was excellent at paclo restaurant the value was amazinq i had the stew vegetable/legumes and my wife had the soup/bouillon the ambience was very good television good carribean music the service was average considered the place was very very busy
If you love Cuban jazz, this place is pretty good
$22 for BIG Sangria pitchers and amazing mojitos
Sometimes people get up and dance, overall a pretty fun spot, although the crowd does tend to be over 30
The food is decent but it's not the main draw
Their food overall is good although they say they're a steakhouse and they sell a couple of steaks

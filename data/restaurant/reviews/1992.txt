This is a seafood joint
I think I might not have been clear enough about that to friends I've directed here
DO NOT order your normal chinese dishes
DO order salt and pepper squid, razor clams, any whole fish (steamed with ginger and soy), crabs, snails in black bean sauce
These are among the best in the city
The hunan beef or whatever is not
Good food, good fun for a group
Shrimp broccoli w mayonnaise was great definitely not the usual fare
Some of our veg dishes were delicious as well, but of course there was also the ubiquitous overly-sweet brown sauces that seem to smother everything Chinese, as well as the obvious presence of MSG in every dish
And, I can't help but feel that non-Asians are taken for a ride in the restaurants of Chinatown
And a FAST ride at that
Our food arrived so rapidly our service was so harried that I got the feeling that we were being rushed in out
And at $25
00 a person, I'd prefer to take my time
The food there is very fresh and they have a varieties of different types of seafood
Good place for seafood lover
I love steam prawn with garlic, deep fried tofu, broccoli and scallop
Check it out!
It's fresh, as fresh is
If you want live fish, razor clams, big plates of prawns, and just outstaning sances, you are at the right place
In Short This cozy corner bar and restaurant--with its five tiny tables--is perched just above Canal but is far enough south and west to be pushing the SoHo designation
Despite an unlikely location, it has its charms, namely an unlikely location and the pursuant low-key feel this tends to bring
The crowd these days is somewhat less over-the-top, but that's probably a good thing if you're looking to enjoy a quiet drink at their wooden bar
Stopped by for brunch
What a dump, with service with super ATTITUDE and totally unmemorable food
Watered down Bloody Mary, with bacon and French Toast of the earlier prepared, re-heated variety
Totally forgettable
Pass this one by big time
Despite being off the beaten track, Cody's is worth a visit
A very casual, friendly, neighborhood feel to the bar, the kind of place where the bartenders remember you and what you drink after just one visit
Nothing too out of the ordinary on the menu, but standard grill food of high quality and good portions
However, you don't even really need the menu, because the daily specials are always tempting and delicious
With five TVs, it's a good place to watch sports
Combined with an substantial brunch menu, Cody's is a perfect spot for Sunday football viewing
(It has more than 5 tables, though!)
PJ's offers great italian food in a relaxed setting
Be sure to try Phil's ravioli
the burgers are the centerpiece here
it would be even better if they did away w/the pita pockets or made them just optional
however, the patties are good quality and thick and juicy
in fact, the burgers here are one of the very top in town
the nachos are average at best
i've been here several times and always get the same waiter, who is very nice
A great place to go into any time of year, but when you can walk in during the dead of winter, order a hot spiced cider and that knockwurst sandwich plate, it's like walking into heaven
I just hope heaven has as good of a beer selection
and that bleu cheese / pear / walnut salad
Damn, I'm hungry
Paoluuci was good
My fiance and I dined there this friday night and I can say that the food was good, a lil over priced
I ordered the chicken picatta and all the dinner entrees only come with potato croquettes and I wanted penne pasta and they charged $7
00 for about 20 pieces of pasta under my chicken
the place is a little dim
But I can only say the food is good
I dined here last night with 11 people
The waiter was slightly rude and not very helpful
I got the linguine with olive oil and garlic which was delicious
However, the restaurant was dark and I didn't like the ambience of it
Also, the music they were playing was terrible
All in all, I would probably come back to this restaurant
I've eaten a lot of good italian food and this was some of the best I've experienced
Our waiter was excellent and the ambiance is perfect
I've eaten at Paoluccis twice and had a phenominal experience both times
Our group was 8 people with small children and we were treated like royality
Do not miss this gem of a restaurant
Fresh, fresh, fresh
No hype
No bull
Just good old fashioned Italian food
And good service
And you don't have to pay a fortune for it
Great value; great taste
One of my favorites
If you are in Little Italy, this is the ONLY place to eat
Excellent food and friendly service - I highly recommend the Veal Danny and the ricotta cheesecake!
it wasnt too crowded, so i was like hmm i dont know
maybe it isnt very good
i ordered the cheese ravioli, and it was soo good!!! the service was good too!
In Short The bar at this L-shaped cafe, with its tin ceilings, exposed-brick walls and flickering candlelight, thrives late into the evening
Art on the walls (featuring local artists) changes periodically--but everyone comes for the burgers
Whether topped with avocado and jalapenos or simply plain, the ground-sirloin patty arrives char-grilled on an oversized bun
Offerings from the busy brunch shift include home-baked croissants and Brie-broccoli stuffed omelettes
I read a previous review of this restaurant and I was furious
I've been going to the Cupping Room for years and always thought the stuff was pretty fresh
When I read the other review and it said it wasn't, I went down for lunch to ask
Well, I'm not sure where that other guy was eating, but when I asked, they walked me over to the open kitchen and I watched the cook making omelettes from scratch
I also found out that everything is homemade: the croissants, the desserts, even the sandwich bread! I wish people would stop hating their own lives and blaming it on someone else
I mean, don't you realize this kind of thing hurts people?
the omletes and who knows what else is premade and reheated to serve, the salads are over-priced and sandy
basically you leave frustrated from paying too much money for poor quality food
In my opinion, the management needs an overhaul
The restaurant was out of everything that I tried to order
I finally settled on a turkey sandwich, (after being told that they were out of the steak, and the pasta of the day) but 15 minutes later the waitress gave me the news that they were also out of turkey!! My friend had the same bad luck when she tried to order a beer
The manager did not seem to care that we were two customers sitting at a table, begging to be fed anything, Anything! He was rude and aloof, an unfortunate reminder of what Soho has become
Skip this place and head to Bubby's where the food and service are better and you pay the same or less
My friends like the food, but it's ok
Service leaves much to be desired
Went for brunch on Sun
3/26/06
Hostess most unhelpful and insensitive
We were complete 6 including 2 kids in tow, which she knew, and proceeds to seat party of 7 who show up 15 minutes after we did, right in front of us ! ! ! Question her about it, to no avail and proceed to get moved to bottom of her wait list

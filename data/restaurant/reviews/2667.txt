It's great, what else can I say! Not only are the pies great, but the food is something else too!
This Egger's has more seating but still has alot of charm
I really like this one better
Staff were helpful, just need to sell more chocolates
This is the prototypical pizza parlor
Love the pizza; great spinach rolls too! I agree that the only down side is that they don't deliver
There is a fancy table-service restaurant on one side of the place, which I've never eaten at, but to me this place is all about good take-out
Great pizzas, calzones and zeppoles as good as those you can get at any Italian fairs! Only major drawback is that they do not deliver!
I have been going to the burrito bar to dinner and just out for drinks for a while
The staff is great
The food is good whether you are going for dinner or just for a couple of drinks and a small appetizer
The maui wowie is the greatest drink ever
You can't beat a $10 pitcher of an awesome drink
the burrito bar has been one of my favorite places for years now
the upstairs dining area is festive and fun
the bar downstairs has a comfortable feel
the food, margaritas, sangria, and staff are great
i've thrown parties there because it's such a fun place, with great food and libations
they also have live music, which adds to the party atmosphere
try it
i think you'll love it !!!!  -gg
Honestly, I do not enjoy the Staten Island bar scene usually
But, The Burrito Bar is really fun
The staff are great, really friendly
This Maui Waui drink everyone mentions actually is awesome, it's served in a pitcher and tastes awesome
Oh, and they have the best Guacamole I've ever had
No lie
I really like the burrito bar
there is a bar/lounge area on the first floor where you'll find a few t
v
's which usually have on a sports gameit is decorated with 60's and 70's themed pictures and knick-knacks there are a few tables to have drinks or snacks
(try the Queso Fundido and fire) Upstairs there is a dining room which is decorated with brightly colored mexican theme
there are candles everywhere etc
the service is excellent and the food is delicious!(try the Citrus Chicken and the Carne Asada)
This place is soooo cool! it
is very different from any other place on S
I
And for that reason alone it is worth a visit
Once you try it , you'll be hooked!  The food is great! Inexpensive and delicious! Service was attentive and the atmosphere was FUNKY and mellow
be ready for something different! Be sure to try the Maui Wowie cocktail
the fire jalepeno app
and the Soft taco plato!
Food is quite tasty, not the best I've had but it's not bad
Service is okay
I've been there several times and the quality of the food and service is quite consistent
Try the Thai ice tea with milk, it's good
Inexpensive too
In Short A low-key, friendly environment attracts plenty of families to this reliable chain
Kids in the big booths--often clutching free balloons and crayons--usually outnumber adults sitting at the bar
The menu offers filling American fare with no surprises, from mozzarella sticks and nachos to rollups and burgers
Entrees include steaks, fajitas and main dish salads
The calorie-conscious can select from a list of Weight Watchers-inspired dishes like mesquite chicken salad and grilled tilapia with mango salsa
I hate this place
Being a vegetarian, there are few appetizing options
But what can you expect with such a low-standard chain?
Best on Staten Island? Hell no
Denino's and Brother's Pizza are #1
As a warning, DO NOT go there after 4pm
The quality of the food and the service diminshes by 75%
I wish I heated up frozen pizza instead tonight
A rice ball to them is white rice made into a ball and deep fried
and that's it
Cold as well
Mozzeralla sticks would have been good, if they listened to me the 5 times I asked for sauce for them and the riceball
I asked if they had a sausage slice
Yes we do she said
I come home to a plain slice with sliced sausage bouncing around in the box
cold as well
Fresh mozzerella slice too
not even heated and stale
I'm just one who hates waiting for 20 min, not putting my stuff in the oven until the last 3 minutes, and get less than par food
I've been going to Bario's for years
I've had several parties there and I've neever had a bad experience
The young ladies there are attentive and easy on the eyes ;-)
Highly recommend this place for the pizza and dinner dishes
NO ONE does a better chicken francese on the island
The wraps, the pasta, the pizza, all top notch
Never had a bad meal in here
I also do takeout and delivery from them all the time
Bario's has the best pizza on all of Staten Island
The espresso and cappuccino is also very good
Bario's has in my opinion the best pizza in Staten Island
I order from them ALL THE TIME
One of their best pasta dishes is the Barracho - penne noodles with spicy sausage and shrimp in a cream sauce - Y U M M Y ! ! ! ! !  :-)
You'd think the way the first reviewer bragged about it, he'd never eaten out before - maybe this deserves a 10 to him, but not to me
It's pretty good pizza, that's about it
And how about losing the insulting take on how Americans of Italian decent speak - it's idiotic
I have been here on several ocassions to see if I came on a bad night
Beginning sushi lovers may be impressed with their selection
However, I have been eating sushi more than 30 years beginning in NY (none around in the boros at that time); this place is not for the more experienced sushi lover
More rice than fish, lower quality fish and higher prices for what you get will now surely keep me away
Definitely not a 10
A very pedestrian Japanese place
I've been eating sushi for more than 25 years, and this is only ok
The type of place for those who have no idea what high quality fish and presentation is
I visited twice and won't be going back
This is the best sushi I've had anywhere, and I eat plenty of sushi
The Yi's roll is amazing, served with a special sauce, it's a must have
Although in Staten Island, it is worth the trip to venture out for superfresh seafood and creative cuisine
I started voyaging to the sushi den about 2 years ago

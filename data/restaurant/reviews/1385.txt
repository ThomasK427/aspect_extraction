We found both at Country! I have been a fan of their sister restaurant, Town, for many years and was looking forward to trying the new place
It really exceeded my expectations! The food was amazing especially the ribs and the roasted artichokes (a side dish) and the staff was great! Dont forget to ask for their sommelier! He made great recommendations
I cant wait to go again!
i am so delighted to have this new, lovely restaurant in our neighborhood! my husband and i have eaten there at least once a week since the place opened
everything is soo delicious - the cafe menu has a great selection of casual comfort foods but each dish maintains an element of sophistication
the exquisite space decor reminds me of a modern chic paris brasserie
also - don't miss the champagne bar upstairs
a true gem!!!
I could not believe how special the staff made me feel
We went there for my b-day and I was treated like a princess though I dont think they would have acted any different towards us if it were not
The food is great to
This is the first restaurant I have been to in NYC that I can truly say it is worth every penny! I must say, skip the cheese plate it was not that good and trade it for another glass of champagne!!
Best of all possible worlds: Brand new modern blended with old fashioned romance
A great bar tender willing to recommend and to get creative
The ambiance is why New York is the coolest
We just spent a long weekend at the hotel and the champagne bar was a fantastic serendipitous add-on
And I'm in love with Sara
My friend and I happened to be walking home from dinner near Madison Square Park and happened upon Country
We went inside and were amazed at the space
we found our way to the champagne bar and sat for 2 hours drinking the most delicious champagne cocktails and eating these delectable warm cheese puffs
The small bar was so cozy yet allowed us to look down upon the whole restaurant
What a find! I can't wait to go back!
BE FOREWARNED! The service here is so bad it is comical! Space is great so I have hopes that they will get a clue and figure out how to run a restaurant
What a incredible space
The high ceillings, and the old world meets modern feel is the perfect place to bring a date
The selection on the tasting board was great
I'll be going back soon
Went to Country on Saturday evening and we were blown away by the beautiful decor in the restaurant and the amazingly chic and European-like Champagne bar and lounge on the second floor
The menu was unbeliveable
every single thing our group ordered was shared and savored
Especialled enjoyed the well priced and selected wines by the glass
We absolutely loved it!
So pleased to have this restaurant in the neighborhood
Finally, somewhere to eat that puts out great food in a grown-up yet cozy ambience
What a wonderful place! It is really luxurious and comfortable and one of those places you could hang out all night
I have been twice (to eat), sat in a booth for dinner and at a cafe table for breakfast, both experiences were really great! The food is such that you can keep coming back, and you can tell this place is designed and built to last! Loved it, great for dates, too
I recommend the Niagara drink or the Sweet Marie :)
Somehow the place is casual yet the details give an air of distinct sophistication
The clubhouse feel of the first floor cafe is very welcoming and I felt at home the entire meal
Make sure to try the pressed chicken
and the peanut butte royale for dessert
I can't wait to see what Zakarian does with the upstairs dining room
I took a peak at it and I felt like I had been transported to a grand eatery in Paris
this place is special and fantastic, the food is original and fairly priced and the place is just dripping with romance, while only open two weeks , it is showing early signs of brilliance, the combo of psaltis and Zakarian is a knockout
The space is pretty but it smelled like stale cigarette smoke
The menu was limited (and bizarre: soft boiled eggs?) and the service was horrendous
If the staff learns to serve in a timely fashion, perhaps it will become more tolerable
The neighborhood sorely needs a place like Cafe at Country
This place has only been open for 6 months
They may be going through their initial adjustment phase, but for that, the waiters/bartenders were so friendly
I was waiting for some friends and a 60 min reservation for tia pol next door
The restaurant didn't mind me sitting on their doorstep to the extent that the bartender invited me in for a drink
Had a drink while on my phone the entire time (most restaurants would give me dirty looks for that but the people here gave me zero attitude)
Bartender made me the BEST ginger martini
I admit I didn't eat the food but the woman next to me swore hers was delicious
Definitely would go back
We wanted to goto Tia Pol, but long wait so we tried this spot
The restaurant had only 2 tables filled (out of 20 avail) with 2 couples at 6:30pm on a Saturday evening
We walked up to the Maitre'd expecting open arms
Unfortunately, for 5 minutes, he kept staring into his reservation book thumbing his fingers up and down the pages with a confused, strained look on his face
I asked what the problem was and he told me that he has reservations coming in and wasn't sure if he could seat us
Now, I expressed my surprise and then the bartender and manager chimed in with a simpleton's remark sir, with restaurants at this time, reservations start coming in
Craziness - EMPTY restaurant and they turn down business
I wish the owners/chefs were there to witness this
We quickly walked out - awful service and terrible attitudes
First time going there, the service leaves much to be improved
The food is good but not overwhelming, with Korean food you would expect bolder flavors
It's a great concept but too middle of the road
Is it a victim of appealing to the masses?? May go back but will definitely give it a little time to find itself
$150 per person and went home unsatisfied
the place is really small and sort of in the middle of no where
not worth what they charge
This place is OVERRATED! Food is decent but portions so small that after 5 appetizers, 2 sides and three entrees, the three of us left still hungry! One hot pork starter literally tasted like bland dish water
The waiter was also THE WORST and poorly educated
He had no idea WHY the menu said ertain dishes recommended a side dish and no clue what the origins were for the oysters which were clearly thought out since there were three different kinds
Anyway, if a side dish is recommended with a menu item, they should simply come together
The table was cramped and the restaurant so loud we couldn't wait to leave
Also, why would any self-respecting Korean-inspired restaurant carry Shochu, which is a JAPANESE KNOCK-OFF of the Koreans' beloved Soju and NOT carry Soju at all except mixed in one cocktail?
Eat out all the time but, worst dining experience in NY
Waiter was completely clueless about the menu
For example, when we asked why certain appetizers recommended side orders, he responded, uh, um
we just recommend a side order
Didn't know where the oysters came from, clueless on the wine list
Were served a 'soup' that literally, truthfully tasted like hot water
Sushi came out late (isn't that Japanese?)
Speaking of which, can't figure out why there are like 20 bottles of sake (Japanese) and no Korean drinks? I've had Korean and NOTHING about this place tasted Korean
Other tables were complaining about slow service, no menus given to them
terrible! BTW, tiny portions - after five appetizers, three entrees and two sides for three people, still left hungry
Only positive was that, though cramped (three of us on a tiny table), ambience was nice
On Tuesday me and my girlfriend had a terrific dinner at Dorahn! It was kind of difficult to actually find this restaurant first (very minimal design concrete storefront) - but at the end of our search we were very impressend
Food was excellent (highlights were mushroom bibibop, scallops, rib eye and yuzu dessert) and innovative
Portions are generally small but reasonably priced
Wine list is short but all bottles are very well chosen (our waiter recommended an excellent red Burgundy which paired well with our food)
Well
overall experience was great so we'll be back soon :-)
D'Or Ahn is an amazing new restaurant
I dined there twice already and always had a great time
The food is out of this world and the service is always there for you
Give it a try
It's a bit pricey but worth it

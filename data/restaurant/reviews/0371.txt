The other person with me ordered a hamburger, which they rated as average
Overall, the atmosphere is average, the service poor, and with food, the chicken is the best
My friends and I have girl's night once a month and this is one of our favorite places to go
We get treated very well and before we sit down to our steaks and fried green tomatoes that we love there - we have a few beers at the bar
The bar scene at the Chop House is great, it's a little more upscale then the other Heartlands which is fun since we are all dressed up when we come from work
We always have a great time there and we love the atmosphere - it really is a beautiful restaurant
The steaks are overpriced and are not that great
Filet magnon was overburnt on the outside as there was no taste to the crust
The beverage menu does not have a list of non-alcoholic beverages as it leaves customers guessing
It is not truly a steak house to USDA prime standards
It's not really all worth the money for a $30 filet mignon
We were trying the food for the first time in the hopes of having a large party here
But we were quite disappointed in the food
The Ginger Chicken Wontons were SOOOOO salty my tonge felt shrivelled
The onion rings were also salted so much you could see the granules
I recognize that they are hoping you will buy more beer, but this was ridiculous
The steak was mediocre, and for 20+ dollars, it didn't even come with a side dish
The creamed spinach was the only worthwhile part of the meal
We didn't even bother trying the rather bland looking desserts
The fact that our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes didn't impress us, either
The place was nice and the food was really good, but out waiter wasn't so hot
We saw other waiters with personality laughing and joking with their tables
We felt a little left out
I guess that shows how important a good waiter is
Granted, we are not used to big city prices, so maybe this is a city average
The lunches cost what dinner does here in Vermont
And the portions were reasonable, but a lunch for four ( 2 adults, 2 kids - no appetizers or beers) cost us $70 after the tip
It was the kid's menu that I did want to comment on
For $10 you get a limited kid's menu
This is steeper than other spots
Those with children may want to look elsewhere
However, the staff is exceptional! That alone made this a plus for our visit
We went to the Chophouse for dinner on a Friday night with three other couples and we were sat right away (without a reservation!) which was great because we had tickets to Urinetown the Musical right across the street
Our waiter seemed to really care about getting us to the show on time, and made some good reccomendations on the menu for doing it
The beers were great, our appetizers came right out, and we even had time for dessert
They had a definite buzz at the bar, but the place is so big that we felt like we had our own private room in the back
One thing to look out for, they do add a tip to the bill if you're more than six people, but at least the waiter told us
Bottle of Red Bottle of White Heartland got me in the mood tonight
My husband and I went to the Chop House on Valentines day, it was our first visit to a Heartland Restaurant
We found the soft lit room, and brick work very warm and inviting
Our server Michael was prompt, and courteous, and took the time to introduce the menu great beers to us
We enjoyed Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail which was very fresh, and the Lobster Bisque was very Creamy and warmed my bones
The Black angus was grilled to perfection, and my husbands Lobster Crab Ravioli was abbondanza !!! Try the Bannana crunch for dessert
Great place, a bit noisy by the bar
This upper west pub house has good burgers, sandwhiches and beers
guys-you might object to their burgers because they're served on english muffins, but they have good flavor
Although their fries need to be cooked more, they are still good
I recommend their sweet potato
I can always count on the Chop House when in Midtown
It can sometimes be crowded and noisy but that's why I love eating and drinking in NYC
I never make it out of there without having the buffalo chicken spring rolls and a home made black cherry soda
Already planning a Jan visit for their delicious barley wine (only once a year
) I can't believe someone complained about having gratuity added when dining out in a group
bummed about the service but things happen sometimes
Don't not check it out based on that review
WHILE THE FOOD WAS OK
JUST NEEDED SOME HEATING; THE BEER WAS WATERY!  SERVICE WAS FINE
If you want a table for two expect to be seated about 3 inches away from the next party with leaning waiters and a noisy bar
The food is ok but overpriced, there are plenty of other good restaurant s in the area, try Blue Water Grill
We got the buffalo spring rolls for an appetizer, which was excellent! We also ordered the crab cakes in lobster sauce
They were small, but filling and delicious
The service was OK
We sat at the bar, and the bartender was not very friendly at all
This was our first stop in NYC and we thought this was how the service was going to be
I'm glad to say we were wrong! We spent around $50
00 on a few beers, a couple of appetizers and tip
very pricey!
Don't get me wrong, the food was good
However, I was dissatisfied with the selection of food and found it to be a little pricey for the amount of food you received
The Scene The Times Square location of this Manhattan mini-chain looks rather mundane from the outside, but once inside reveals itself to be a large, bi-level room lit with a golden glow
In typical sushi restaurant style, natural blond wood is everywhere--although the bamboo poles are deployed a little too liberally
Service is good-humored and knowledgeable
The Food Though not for sushi aficionados, the food here is surprisingly good, and better than at some other Haru branches
Shrimp tempura is fluffy, crispy and light, and chopsticks slice easily through tender miso black cod
Sushi and sashimi portions are pert and reliably fresh, although you won't find any exotic delicacies here
If you're feeling hungry, try the juicy, lightly wok-seared tuna entree, which piles up the slices
Live orange clam is not to be missed--served up in a generous-sized shell, it has the fresh brininess of oysters
Hadn't realized that Haru was a NYC restaurant too (I'd only been to the one in Philly), but found this one in Times Square on a recent visit
The manager was the cutest thing ever and so sweet, and the fairy lights and bamboo branches (or whatever they were) were a great touch
Tried a bunch of appetizers (lobster mango ceviche + symphony were fantastic) and some sake
Different vibe than Philly but every bit as good
Highly recommended
The basic sushi items and rolls are average
There's nothing wrong with them, but there's nothing special, either -- considering that, they're grossly overpriced
Most of the non-sushi items I've had are pretty good, though
That, plus the very nice ambience and the good bar make it a good place to stop by with friends or a date for a dinner or drink when you want Japanese food in a nice atmosphere
For these reasons, you'll want to pass on this place as a take-out option, though
Its best attributes are the ambience and location, which don't translate to the office or home even though the bill does
I've had better Japanese food at a mall food court
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience
However, after being seated literally on top of the next table (couldn't even fit between the two tables, I'm small) and then having to scream to my husband because of the high noise level, it quickly lost its appeal
After seeing the high prices I thought the food would be great and the sushi was very good
But the meals were terrible
I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got Garlic Shrimp
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful
The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt, we got seated right away and the server was very friendly
I wouldn't ever go back
Way too much money for such a terrible meal
My friend and I were wandering through Times Square at night and we didn't want to eat at Olive Garden or another American food joint
So we tried Haru- and were very pleased

Becco was worth every cent
Kid Freindly: YES Romantic: NO A zoo
My wife and I had the pasta salad Prix fix
Not bad - but the place was packed tighter than a sardine can with screaming kids all over the place
We couldn't wait to leave
If you're into carbo loading before a marathon this place is for you
Anybody else - go elsewhere
The $20 wine list was a nice aspect of the experience
Very large portions
Great service
This is the best pre theatre dinner there is
Pretty dining rooms- busling with people going to shows
Very fun atomosphere
Great prices- price fix pasta meal was great and reasonable wine selection
Great service too!
My fiance and dined there on Saturday 5/3/03
We arrived about 5:30 without a reservation
Within a 1/2 hour we were seated
Great food for the price
If you do the prix fix it's $21
We ordered from the menu
The steak was great, as well as the special that evening, stuffed boned suckling pig
The only negative I can say is that their pasta as well as their risotto were a little too al dente for me
I don't know if they always cook them that al dente or if it was just the chefs that night
Oh
and 100 wines under $20!
Once we sat, a box of homemade bread was placed on the table with a nice orange table dip
We all ordered priced fixed which was three delicious pastas coming after a fresh vegetable plate and cesare salad
I saw a steak at the table next to us I WISH i had ordered, but the desserts were great
I will definitly go back
My guests and I were stunned by the stuffed shells we had at Becco the other night
We asked our server what was in it, and he said it was ORANGE ZEST! I've never heard of that before! We also had Rigatoni with Broccoli and Garlic (mmmmm
) and a Fetucini with a meat sauce
A dessert sampler was shared for the table and consisted of bread pudding, homemade ice cream, a chocolate mousse to die for and fresh berries that were so good they should be illegal
I highly reccomend Becco
The staff was fantastic, and be sure to say hello to the tall guy who sells the wine
His choices for our party were outstanding
Brought my parents there for my dad's 60th birthday!! Food and Sevice was great
Fantastic
The pasta all you can eat three different kinds is an awesome idea
and they're delicious
This has been my second time there and I will soon visit again because everything on the menu looks good
Service was great and the ambience was homey
The wine guy made great selections and we will soon b back
Food was ok
It was packed the night we went
Took forever to get our soda refills (too much ice, too little coke!!)
We tried the prixe fixe but pasta being pasta, you can only eat so much
We didn't have enough time to try the dessert sampler, which sounded nice
fun staff, food is ok, great prix fix $20 win list
I took my boyfriend there for his birthday (we went to Felidia for my birthday)
Rife, our waiter was AWESOME! His recommendations were right on the money
The aps, the dinner, the wine, the desert! Absolutly Fabulous
Close quarters allow for friendly conversation between tables
Yes they have pre-fix pasta, but the other items on the menu are not that expensive and yummy too! HIGHLY recommended! Def
will go back again!
Becco was the perfect way to start my birthday celebrations in the City! Four of us ordered of the pre fix menu and enjoyed sharing the fabulous treats with each other
For dessert, the sampler tray had a simple candle in it in honor of my birthday, but there was no obnoxious or embarrassing singing
The food was great! The decor was simply elegant
A fantastic experience!
Fantastic wine selections
The $20 wine list had some surprising standouts
We had a large table so we were able to experiment and the staff was very helpful with recomendations
I had the pasta dinner and wasn't very impressed with the quality
It was good, but i had been expecting better
The seafood appetizer was a little fishy also
Service was great
The staff was friendly and attentive
Overall I recommend this restaurant, especially for larger groups who can take advantage and appreciate the large selection and varient of wine
We dined here on the first night of our first visit to NYC
This was a perfect start to our trip
the prix fixe menu was great - and the pasta was phenomenal! Definitely recommend it
A friend and I dined at Becco pre-theatre during the busy holiday season
The place was packed, but we didn't feel rushed
The atmosphere was warm and friendly
The food was superb; our delicious pumpkin soup was served piping hot from a pot the server brought to the table
The Caesar salad (which comes with every entree) was heaped upon our plates from a huge platter
The entrees were so large, I took my leftover portion home and had lunch for two the next day! Each item on the dessert sampler plate was to die for
The only negative thing I can say is that we were unaware of the specials because our server did not inform us
Otherwise, a lovely experience
My husband, two teenagers, and I just enjoyed a pre-theatre dinner at Becco and the meal was absolutely delightful
I ordered the Prix Fixe Pasta while my husband and children ordered from the menu - we were all happy with our choices
The meal was well-paced, the wine list terrific for the price and the wait staff was helpful and pleasant
On a busy night we were taken care of
We watch Lydia on T
V
all the time and actuallt saw her son Joe at the place Becco last weekend
Waiters and Waitresses were wonderferfull and dinner was amazing
I had an osobucco and George had the whoile fish they call Pesce Interno
Ceaser Salad was as good as it gets and I can't wait to go back again
Hope Lydia is there to sign my book!!!
Make sure to make a reservation for this restaurant, because many people know how good it is and you'll wait
The food was excellent and the service was just as good
Have an empty stomach when you go because the portions are big
Prices are reasonable, worth every penny
In between shows on Saturday, we thought we'd try to sneak into Becco
Reservations were unsuccessful, but we showed up anyway and were assisted by the doorman who helped us with the menu and took our order! When we sat, our dinner was delivered promplty (Like FAST) and we had plenty of time to make The Goat, which by the way I also recommend highly (Great Show!)
Look forward to going back with more time and really diving in to the menu and the wine list
Lidia always makes her pasta smile :)  I Did after eating at Becco
Perfect Spinach Ravioli and a tender homemade linguni with Tomato and Basil

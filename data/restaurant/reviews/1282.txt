in Park Slope-FINALLY! Lots of the menu items and other foods for sale are homemade
I have had a couple of the sandwiches and salads on the menu--all of the ingredients are super fresh and high quality, plus it's a handy place to pick-up top o' the line cheeses and meats and other snacks for entertaining
Even though it's mainly for takeout, there are a few tables and the place has a cozy, cheerful feel to it
The sandwiches are sublime and the atmosphere is bright and lively
I love getting one of their daily dinner specials to take home and enjoy after work
My favorite things on the menu are the cuban mojo, slow roasted beef (order it hot!!!!) , french herb roasted chicken and meatloaf dinners and scrumptious
I can't wait for the backyard to open just in time for the nice weather
My date and I were first time walk-ins on a recent night and were seated at the corner table at the window
This is a charming, unassuming, low-key room
As others may have said, seating is close and the noise level is high
We sat for some time before I asked a busboy if we could order drinks
We sat some more
I noticed a number of the waiters casually chatting at the back of the room
We waited some more
Finally someone arrived and took our drink order, which took some more time to arrive
After that a waiter arrived with menus and told us about the specials
It was a long time to wait, although it gave my date and I a chance to talk
A lot
We each had the beet salad, I had the filet mignon and she had the red snapper
The food was all very good (but uninspired)and the waiter did seem to become a bit more attentive as the evening wore on
We finished with tiramisu (not bad) and cappucinos
The bill came to $104
If I was in the area again, in a pinch, and had a lot of free time I would certainly go back
I went there on sunday night with bunch of my friend to celerbrate my friend's birthdsay
let me tell you we had a fantastic time
The food was great and the service was wonderful
I didn't like how my monk fish came out but the waiter didn't say another word he was gladly changed to other dish very fast so I could eat with my frineds
all my friends are Italian and they think It was very good food as well
you know how picky they are about food and wine
I would love to go there again
very soon
you should too
I liked the food and would want to eat it again
Unfortunately, I'll never go back on a weekend
The space is cramped and simply not pleasant to sit in
I like to have some element of relaxation when I dine, and this place was just not comfortable
Then there's the incredible volume of noise, which probably has more to do with the small, box-shaped dining room packed with people than the crowd who happened to be there on that particular night
I don't mind a nosier room if I'm with a group and am comfortable, but this place is too small and compacted to be good for groups
I'd go back on a night when nobody was there
Food is good
Portions aren't big, however
What A Major Diappointment!!! I understand noise level in most NY restaurants can be loud - but this was unbearable
It seems they cater to large theatre groups (in a relatively small space)
If you are unfortunate to be there on a night when they do, your dining experience is up for grabs in terms of noise, service and food preparation
Their swordfish in shallot sauce tasted like burnt onions in a beef consome base
Bad news, if you are avoiding beef
They seem seduced by their new success - giving up quality dining for packing them in
If you are couple or a foursome, forget it - unless you love shouting and receiveing service as it comes your way
You'll have far more peace of mind if you grab a sandwich and munch it outside the theatre
Shame on this restauranteur for subjecting his customers to this dining experience
I ate here last night, and must say that the food was incredible
Each course that was brought out was better than the one before! The value also can not be beat-- the most expensive entree is $20, and that's a good sized steak (which my boyfriend had and raved about)
Desserts were out of this world, as was the white asparagus appetizer
I'll definitely be back, with all of my friends!!
We've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed
Fish is done to perfection and the pastas are incredible
The staff has always been friendly and professional
You can't beat the value for your money either!
i was very disappointed about this little place that my friends reccomended many times
Very crowded yes,slow service yes, and cold food,were a superb combo for just leave and don't come back ever again
beside the fact that the waiter is picking his NOSE in the dining room while approccing tables that's really bad ! no, thanks, no more !
Appetizers were good (shrimp and portobello mushroom)
Steak medium is Steak WELL DONE--food took long enough to not send back
Grilled Chicken was good
Deserts: Chocolate cake good, DO NOT HAVE THE APPLE PIE--terrible
Coffee old and burnt tasting
Service was adequate--but never asked how entrees were
THEY DO NOT ACCEPT MC/VISA--Manager was extremely rude-saw him yell at waitress and was flip about the Visa issue
Not recommended
The best Italian food in Hell's Kitchen! Especially for this price! A very welcome addition to a neighborhood that is filled with mediocre Italian restaurants
Service is not always great, but overall, tje waiters are so nice and personal, you forgive them
However, be warned that space is very tight and noise level can rise quite high
Still, I've been back there many times and like the ambiente - the food has always been molto bene
So cheap
my husband and i had a wonderful experience
One of the best in NYC and not just for the price
Food is outstanding and the prices are so, so reasonable
If you do a play you must make reservations for Roberto Passon afterwards
Try the Grouper, it's simply great! No exceptions
Fabulous neighborhood restaurant
Outstanding food and menu selection
Service is great and personable
An excellent value for a neighborhood that tends to have overpriced or touristy restaurants
We have been there a few times now - salads, pastas, and fish dishes are great!!! I esspecially love the proscuitto and white asparagus appetizer
I cannot complain about desserts either, very tasty!
I've been a regular since they opened a few months ago and I have always had an excellent experience
Food is a good value overall, there are numerous interesting dishes on the menu that you don't see on typical menus
For example appetizers include white asparagus with egg + prosciutto, octopus, and chicken livers with pears
I'm also a fan of the pastas, entrees, and desserts and would describe them all, but am limited to 150 words
Biggest negative by far is the layout of the restaurant
It seems they have tried to squeeze the maximum number of tables into the restaurant
From the outside this place looks like its rundown and small but in the inside it has hard-wood floors a large bar area and small tables
I didn't find the food to be to die for
It was ok
I wished it would've had more seasonings or at least better appealing
We ate in fast food restaurant containers and plastic utensils
Not appealing
I live in Manhattan, but regularly make the trek out to South Slope for some AMAZING BBQ at Bar BQ
As if the to-die-for BBQ isn't enough of a reward for coming to brooklyn, I walk out the door for practically pennies, even after a few drinks
An absolutely incredible find that is now one of my favorite spots in the city

Maybe I'm really out of touch with reality, but I think $11 for a gin/tonic is absolutely obscene! If it were a large glass or if I could have TASTED the gin, that's a different story
Having just returned from Bourbon Street, I thought I had experienced the steepest drink prices in the US, but this is worse than N'awlins, where at least the expensive drinks cover wonderful live music
So, get drinks elsewhere, have a nice dinner here, and stop by the package store on the way home where you can get a bottle of Bombay Sapphire for the cost of 2 drinks here
The service here is the worst I've ever encountered in my life! - And I've been in NYC for 15 years
Although we had a reservation, our B-day party was seated about 45 minutes late
Our waiter was snobby and outright rude; he said getting us drinks after we paid our bill would be 'too much of a hassle for him'
Some members of our party were not let in - even after arguing with the doormen, who were rude as well; one threatened me, while the other wanted to pocket an extra $10 for our friends to be allowed in, who were guests for our dinner reservation
I highly recommend staying away from this place
Although we made reservations, we were seated 20 minutes later
The food was good but unfortunately the service was horrible
First of all the waiter rushed us to order since he said the kitchen would be close, but an hour later they brought food to another group
I guess that was his attempt to turn over tables quickly
Another thing, the waiter gave us the wrong check and it took him awhile to straighten it out
They really need to work on their customer service
Had my Bday party there on Saturday and it was fantastic! My group of 15 had a dinner first (the food was excellent, partcularly the lamb!), and than we stayed for cocktails (inventor of those Rose and Elderflower martinis is a genius!)
The music was great and crowd very hip and cool
Now all my friends want to have their parties there
Would strongly recommend it, not just for atmosphere and crowd, but also food and those amazing cocktails
However, if you decide to have your party there, make sure to give your guestlist to the management - otherwise your friends who come late may not be able to get in
Pretty good food, small portions- amazing ambiance and special cocktail list
I would definitely go back, but probably to lounge with friends, rather than dinner
Service! Service! Service! Isnt that what Restaurants are all about Well this place lacks it big time
They are RUDE, OBNOXIOUS and the Doormen act like its the GHETTO
Don't even stand in line if you are not on the guestlist and if you are, plan to stand in line for at least 1/2
We had table reservations and still had to wait 45 mins to be seated
Lacks class
There are better places out there
Spend your money someplace else
This restaurant is really pretty
The food was good, small portions
Our waiter was not that helpful, looked kind of annoyed when we were asking him for suggestions
He spilled half my martini and did not even apologize
The after-dinner lounge was excellent
Great music
I would definately go back but I'll try a different waiter this time
Granted, there isn't much of a choice when it comes to appetizers, entrees or dessert - our waitress was really friendly and gave excellent advice on the delicacies of the restaurant
It was romantic, with prompt service and excellent music
My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed this place and look forward to going back for enjoying the lounge it's party aura
I have been there twice for dinner, and will definitely be going back again soon
Liked everything about it
the decor, the ambiance, the drinks, the food -- the lamb was absolutely delicious
The atmospere in the place is great
Love the lighting and format a lot! Great place for drinks late at night and a great place to bring a date
Only had a couple of apps and they were filling and tasty but I get the impression this is more of fun place to hang out for the bar scene
I highly recommend it!
What can I say about Taj
First impressions are said to be key
Well this place delivers in this department
The decor, style, and feel of Taj are great; I was very excited about it from the moment I walked in
Unfortunately it is all downhill from there
The service is cold and unfriendly, which I have come to expect from places like this, but what I can't tolerate is being rushed
The food was good, nothing that will win any accolades, but rather pricey for the quality
As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree
Overall I would skip dinner and hit this place for its bar/lounge atmosphere
the decor is nice enough, but the attitude of the staff sucks
despite calling ahead and being told we'd have no problem, my group was kept waiting in the rain for ages and then made to buy ridiculously overpriced bottles at a table rather than (almost as overpriced) drinks at the bar
i'm never going back!
Fusion restaurants confuse me
Either its done extremely well and very innovative or its down right robbery
This place was robbery! Service was good up until the point the staff wanted to seat 8, 8!!!! of us at a small round table not much larger than a studio sized coffee table
This guy who looked like the mgr actually tried to point out empty space between us
I guess he figuredwhen the the food came, we turn our backs to each other to create elbow room so we can feed ourselves
Portions were justlarge enough, for a 2 year old and it was nothing special
(Dusting some curry powder on chicken and adding spinach on the side doesn't make it Indian fusion!) Cool decor though, but not much of a dance floor
Pretty popular now, but it will eventually fall by the wayside as people start to recognize its cons
This place rocks! The food and cocktails are amazing
The service is excellent and some really beautiful staff
Came on a Wednesday night with a large group of friends for a birthday
had so much fun
great place to take a date too! Loved this place, would go back again
I was pleasantly surprising going to this restaurant on my first visit to New York City
The atmosphere is great, and the lounge is full of beautiful people
The chicken is wonderful and the service is above average
The only down side is that it is kind of pricey but I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are looking to impress on a first date
There are many in places in the City that you fit the mold of 1) great ambience 2) so-so or worse food and 3) snooty service
Fortunately, Taj is NOT one of these places
We went to Taj on a Tuesday night, at the same time a private event was going on for a magazine
I figured we had run into our worst nightmare
As it turned out, the food was very good, with the snapper, the lobster, and the lamb chops all excellent choices, as well as the scallop and shrimp appetizers (you really need to order one of each/person to get enough food)
Even more surprising was the warm and friendly service, from the hostess to the wait and busing staff! Yes, the portions are a bit small and it is not cheap, but Taj offers you a great venue for a fun and satisfying evening
I took my boyfriend there for a birthday dinner as a surprise and he loved it! The food was great (bombay fries, lobster, tenderloin) and the drinks were very original - favorite bar drinks with the restaurant's personal touch
The service was friendly
Our seat was so comfortable (a couch with lots of pillows) that we almost fell asleep
The ambience was both romantic and posh at the same time
This is a beautiful place with great ambiance
The staff is very friendly and the service is great
The food is a bit pricey, but if you pick the right things its worth it
The scallops appetizer is AMAZING, but the duck I had for an entree was just ok
The music got a bit loud around 9pm, but otherwise, the dim lighting and decor gave it a very sexy feel
I loved this place and would recommend it for anyone who loves good food and a great time with friends
Great directly after work
Went on a monday at about 6 empty but was filling in as I left at 9
Gret comfortable atmosphere, quiet ambient music until the DJ got there then it got a little too loud
Good food for the price, on a date expect to spend no less then $100
Service was a little pushy, especially since there was no one in there
This place can be great or terrible, it depends what you are looking for
The music is loud, especialy if they are doing a 'show'
You can't even talk when they are doing a show
The food is EXCELLENT! I was with a group of 6, and every entree and app was great - the dessert was OK
Drinks are way over priced at $10 for a stoly-o and cran, and the menu is a pricey too

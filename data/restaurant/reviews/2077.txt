The food is great, the price is right and most importantly the service is fantastic and friendly- never rushed, never harried- always like going to see a good friend
A place you can kick back and relax, have dinner, snacks or just a few drinks
Love it - the bartender's great, the crowd is easy-going, the food is good and reasonably priced, and they let you draw on the table with crayons
Who could ask for more??? Well, more space at the bar would be nice, but then it wouldn't be as much fun
Appetizers or hearty dinner fare, Tavern on Jane's got the perfect drink accompaniment
Fantastic (and substantial!) spring rolls, calamari, salads, burgers, fish-and-chips
you name it
Congenial surroundings and mellow vibe make it a great afternoon hideout or afterwork hangout
I've never been to the actual restaurant, but this small take-out shop makes me want to try it
The sandwich I had was excellent, the servers friendly, but the price was a bit much
This is a typical New York diner, and the service was quick and polite
From the enormous menu, we opted for the 3-course dinner specials - chicken soup or clam chowder, although small portions, came with loads of rolls, crackers etc
Big fresh mixed salad followed with choice of homemade dressings, then main course - my boiled beef dinner had huge slices of beautiful meat with vegetable potatoes, my wife's bbq combo was great
With beer coke, total bill only $24
00!!!!!!
What has a menu longer than my nose, and is more satisfying? The Waverly! 24 hours, breakfast all day, anything you could possibly desire in diner food, great staff and decent prices
When you are done with Babbo 1/2 block away, and you have no money, but still need a Belgian waffle, come on down to the diner that will comfort your needs
This place has great milkshakes and yummy eggs and nice staff
Sometimes it is too filling
I like the presentation of the eggs
I like the booths
It's open all the time, which is good
and only $3
15!!! this place is a great breakfast place
the prices are great, the space is very neat - a real diner
the service, at the counter was the way to go - otherwise the line gets to long to wait for a table - the place is small
i still can't get over how inexpensive and good the cheesecake was
i've paid a lot more for cheesecake that didn't come close to this one
This is a typical diner
However, their homefries were terrible, very greasy and bland
Also, the gg sandwhich was not as good as the fried eggs in a pan
All in all, it was OK - certaintly not worth a return trip with all the other places to have brunch in NYC
This has got to be one of the most reliable 24/7 diners out there
The food's not bad either
Like someone else said, don't go for the fancy dishes, stick to the basics which is what they do best
The place is open round the clock and gets crowded even at 3 AM, mostly folks unwinding from the bar and club scene ducking in for some coffee and bites
Service is prompt and businesslike, has to be with the kind of crowd this place packs in on the weekends
I love this place! The food is great, the waitstaff very friendly (Omar knows me and my boyfriend by name and what drinks we want without even asking anymore), and it's open 24-7
Great place for people watching at any hour of the day
The Waverly Melt (burger on toasted bread with cheese, fried onions, onion rings, and french fries) is my favorite
For a fast tuna melt, cup of chicken soup or eggs (fried are served in fry pan), it works though you may have to wait for a table
But it's simply a coffee shop, nothing more and not necessarily among the best
The burger is decent, but let's not steer people to think this is more than it is
This place is great for diner food and breakfast
The grilled pattie melt rules
The fries are tasty
And the service is quick
Obviously this place isn't for a romantic night out, but it's great for yummy food at good prices
This place can get a little cramped
After a long night of drinking,  this place is a nice oasis
This place has yet to catch on, but it always seems on the verge
I hope it doesn't happen
Why? Because I know at any hour, of any day, in whatever condition I'm in, my friends and I can get amazing food and great coffee in a great atmosphere where we can sit, smoke, and relax
One of the few places in town that lets you smoke, it's much appreciated
The decor is hilarious (headshots of people who were obviously never famous
check out The Champ) and the waitstaff is always kind
You're never rushed, and they'll know whether to joke with you or leave you alone
The Waverly Melt is the best patty melt in the city, but skip the appetizers (the onion rings are woeful)
Other than that, stay away from the fancier fare (no place cooks good calamari at 330am) and enjoy the rest
I always come here for when I want breakfast for lunch
Their omelet specials that come with home fries and toast are one of my favorites
Add a dollar or so more and you can get a whole variety of other items to go with your meal
The french toast, sandwiches and soups are great too
Large portions and inexpensive
Cozy small place where you occasionally feel a surprisingly relaxing rumble of the subway underneath your seat
Cafe Espagnol offers New Yorkers tasty seafood at very reasonable prices while filling you up with tastey sangria
If you're looking for non-seafood, go somewhere else, because you'll be dissapointed to order it from Cafe Espagnol
My girlfriend and I made the mistake on our first visit and we paid for it with a horrid dining experience
Our second time around, we did it right by sharing some clams and mussels as appetizers, followed by a shot of Petrone and their Lobster Special
We were glad that we took the regulars' advice on our second visit
We'll DEFINATELY be back again
Went on a Wednesday night
It was lively, but not uncomfortably loud or crowded
The service was very friendly and attentive
We enjoyed calamari as an appetizer (cooked perfectly-nice and tender, with a nice light batter and spicy sauce)
For entrees, my friend had the surf and turf and I had the shrimp with garlic sauce
The steak was perfect-nice and tender and the lobster delicious as well
The shrimp entree is a generous portion, the garlic sauce has a nice spicy bite to it
For dessert, we shared a sampling of the dessert items on the menu
All were delicious, the tiramisu was a standout
Throughout the meal we enjoyed delicious margaritas and daiquiris
We were also treated to a serenade by two guitarists/singers who took requests
The restaurant has a cozy, relaxed atmosphere
Great for either a romantic dinner or a fun night out with a big group
Highly recommend this restaurant if you like great food and excellent service
The atmosphere is peaceful and cozy
Wonderful Sangria!!!!!
for $12
95 you get a salad, a 1
25 lb lobster and a choice of side dishes
The steamed lobster was very tasty
The gazpacho and sangria are also outstanding, and a phenomenal value
Service is amoungst the most attentive I've ever seen (the waiter stpped my girlfriend from pooring herself more sangria so he could pour it) and they even put on your lobster bibs for you
The owners of this restaurant also own the Cafe Espanol on Bleeker and the Salon de Tapas on Sullivan, and you can't go wrong at any of their locations
this place has a $9
95 lobster special every night of the week, and also a steak special for about $12
95
my friend and i had the lobster and it's amazing
it comes with salad and a vegetable on the side so you can't beat the price
we also had the sangria

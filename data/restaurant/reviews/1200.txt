oh, and they ONLY TAKE CASH!!!!
food was tasty, prices are reasonable
Plus all you can drink mimosa's for brunch! If you can, sit in the back
large space with skylights
I think this restaurant is just what the slope needs, there are Italian restaurants in the neighborhood but this one has really soulful, affordable food
The atmosphere is warm and inviting, not too swank and not too laid back -it's just right, I feel comfortable going with friends or taking my family and kids
Be adventurous, you won't be disappointed -the pastas are exceptional
I understand the chef makes his own wild boar sausage, it's a winner
Other reasons for choosing Scottadito? Ample and affordable wine list, friendly service, PARKING!
After the sudden downfall of an old standby up the street, KHII was a welcome addition
A couple of friends stopped by here when the place was first opened and they raved about the quality of the meat, the vegetables and the breads
One of them took me here last night and we were both very disappointed
Gone were the quality ingredients
We were presented with the same greasy mess that is served in many late night kebab places in the city
The super harsh lighting only made the experience more miserable
Hospitable, Clean, Food that is created to perfection
!!! I feel like I am in a warm italian dining room
Home !!!! That is where I eat when I eat at La Masseria
Think Tuscan Villa with a splash of the spice of Southern Italy
I am a devoted La Masseria patron
Even when it is busy (pre theater) the food comes out perfectly
So good I wanted to keep it my secret
My husband is Italian and is very critical when it comes to food
La Masseria is now his favorite restauant in all of New York
I could describe the food, but words would not do it justice, you have to taste it for yourself
The most gigantic ,and delicious steak i had i the city
My boyfriend and I,spend so much time searching for the perfect meat dish
The atmosphere is really nice,and the friendly service helps to soften the high check at the end of the meal
well,it's new york baby nothing come's for free! I toke the bottle empty Barbera Martanetti because was so delicious,and i can't find it anywhere retails ! Next visit will be experiencing more delishhh
wonderful, warm italian country atmosphere
loved the food - especially the fried zucchini - yum! also make sure to try the stuffed mozzerella as an appetizer - our table devoured the dish
service is very friendly (ask for Pepi) - also great wine by the glass at the bar
You are lucky if you happen to stumble upon this fabulous French patisserie-bakery-cafe in DUMBO, Brooklyn
My French boyfriend agrees that the French Baguettes are the best outside of France, and the pastries are great (especially the Creme Brulee Cake and Chocolate Eclairs)
The French owner and chef can always be seen baking in the back kitchen making his pastries, and is always willing to come out for a friendly chat
At lunch time a daily changing selection of sandwiches served on fresh baguettes come out (Chicken Pesto, Pate, and super good Tuna are a few of the choices) as well as soup du jours and German pretzel breads
Its only a matter of time before this one-year old DUMBO treasure becomes a favorite throughout Brooklyn
The Scene There is no visible pretense inside this homey dining room with a relaxed staff and simple decor
Yet the well-dressed professional crowd knows looks can be deceiving; behind the benign appearance is a kitchen turning out mini-masterpieces from a seasonal American menu
The Food Each bite bursts with flavor--thanks in part to the use of organic meat, wild fish and local produce
For starters, try a sinfully rich plate of scallops in a rutabaga-thyme puree with Parmesan broth or the giggly braised pork belly atop caramelized apples
Though not as flavorful, the lobster salad atop fennel still bursts with zing
An order of the most tender braised short ribs around will make you the table's instant hero
Equally elegant is the striped bass with vegetables in a curried cream sauce, made divine by the addition of plump mussels
The sweet-tart grapefruit brulee counters with a cooling note
I find many of the preceding reviews improbable at best
(makes you wonder if they aren't written by competing restaurants) This is one of the best, if not THE best, meals I've had in my life
My wife and I have dined all over the country and abroad, we love food, and we definitely appreciate high quality ingredients
Applewood is a restaurant with integrity (slow food supporters) making use of local, organic ingredients and doing an amazing job
The flavors are fabulous, fresh and beautifully balanced, the service is attentive, without being overbearing and the atmosphere is cozy and comforting
I can't imagine going anywhere else for the price!
I was concerned about all the other reviews here, but given they have only reviewed this one restaurant I usually discount them as they aren't very accurate
I had dinner last night which consisted of an appetizer of the braised veal cheeks and the duo of rabbit, braised and confit
Both dishes were amazing
Perfectly seasoned and prepared
From what I have seen applewood only serves the best organic and locally farmed ingredients
The prices tend to be somewhat higher, but you are paying for first class ingredients
I would say go judge for yourself, you won't be dissapointed
The food is sub-par
It's like someone scrounged through their own crappy vegetable garden and threw whatever they could find on a plate with no seasonings
It's bland and will not wow anyone who has ever eaten out
The service is Ok, but they must have drank the coolade, as they believe that they are serving good food! I would not waste this place on a Tuesday night, let alone a special event
Went to Applewood for our anniversary dinner
Great dinner, until the waiter decided to choose our dessert for us without our consent
We were looking forward to specific desserts which were in season
The waiter's decision put a damper on our special day
We walked in without reservations and waited for quite awhile
Once we were seated, our waiter had to be prompted to bring us bread even though he came to the table 3x and knew we stood waiting for a table for nearly forty minutes
He never even mentioned that bread would be brought
Then when our meals arrived, my risotto was not cooked thoroughly and still quite raw in the center, a starchy chewiness, not al dente
My husband's entree, pork chop over red wine braised lentils, was subpar
even terrible might be appropriate b/c the lentils were so saltly, no human being would be able to stomach it, AND I like salt far more than the average person
They were outrageously salty and everyone at the table of five agreed, they were inedible
The atmosphere was nice and charming but the food was not good but rather memorably bad
Overpriced, small portions, loud, cheap furniture, way-too-small tables, poor value, etc, etc, etc
This place does not live up to the hype
Go to Stone Park, Al di La, 12th Street BG, or even Olive Vine for better food and value
This place is pretentious in the worst way possible
It's pretending to be both casual and refined but can't figure out which one it wants to be
we've been a few times - loved it the 1st and have been more and more disappointed each visit
i think we're done
it's friendly, but the service is not so good - the bread girl kept passing us to the point we thought it was a joke
the food is good, but nothing has sides - a few heads of baby cauliflower, a couple of roasted hazelnuts
and my fish was undercooked
for the hype and the price - it should be better
chestnut on smith st has similar style with much better food
I wanted to check out the restaurant once I read New York Magazine
I live in the negihberhood, so my girlfriend and I went for dinner
we made no reservations and opted to dine at the bar
the ambience is spot on
it's really warm and cozy
the bar was perfectly comfortable
our bartender was quick and on point
he made some great recommendations
their cheese platter was out of this world
I then opted for the venison
it was cooked to perfection
you might find the combination of the two a bit too much in one seating
we will definately be back

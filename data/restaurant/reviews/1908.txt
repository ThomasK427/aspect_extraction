It's also close to the 6 and the N/R/W trains, a big plus for me
It never disappoints! I go to Spring St
anytime I want great food at a reasonable price
It's a nice casual restaurant where you can enjoy your meal without being rushed! This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in New York!
Terrible food
The only thing my entire party could taste is garlic
I had a caesar salad that was dripping in disgusting garlic dressing or some sort
You really can't beat Spring Natural for great, organic food at a reasonable price
And their bread basket is really excellent
It often gets mistaken for a vegetarian restaurant, which it's not
although I don't think there is any beef on the menu (but there is plenty of fish and chicken)
Great service and a great enviornment
I keep having dinner here because their location, food, and service are all too good for the reasonable price
I can bring my vegetarian friends while I satisfy my craving for fish
The food was very good and the service was excellent
The price was also very reasonable
Go for the appetizers!!
I've only been here two times, but both times my food was really good and the place wasn't too crowded or noisy
The bread basket alone is delicious, and they have many choices of organic food whether you're vegetarian or not
I was happy to find bluefish here, which I don't see often, and the simple rice, vegetable, and seaweed platter was very satisfying
The prices are reasonable, the waitstaff is nice, and I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone
I was shocked that a restaurant in a select location could serve such atrocious food
Don't be fooled by the busy front window
Once inside, you will find that the busy restaurant front is exactly that - a front for the empty interior
Wine drinkers beware: After making selections, we learned that despite the wine list, the restaurant was out of the basic Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay
Hungry patrons beware: Your child-sized portion won't arrive for an hour, and when it does, don't expect hot food
My order arrived as an obviously recently thawed and overcooked chicken breast, instant mashed potatoes (they were out of risotto but we weren't informed), and spinach (also the frozen variety)
Our neighboring table guests ate 1/3 of their steak before asking the waiter to take it away
I expected a decent meal, but everything from the yeasty unfresh bread to the service was poor
Came for lunch with my sister to grab a quick bite while shopping
Took forever to order, and the waitstaff was completely inattentive
We finally got our watered down sodas with a few pathetic slices of bread
When our food finally came, my cheeseburger was lukewarm, and the cheese had obviously been slapped on at the last minute - almost plastic tasting
My fries (more like the few crumbs) were cold
Her $7 cup of soup was room temperature
As others have observed, there weren't many other customers there, but yet everything managed to be mediocre at best
You would be better off at one of the restaurants on West Broadway
I've eaten at many restaurants in NYC - most of them relatively inexpensive (unlike this one) - and I could never say that I had a BAD meal
until now
On a Monday night at dinner time there was only one other table full besides ours, and the waitstaff was rather annoying mostly because they were bored
I ordered an appetizer salad and when the plate came out, it was not what I ordered, but the waiter tried to pass it off as the same salad, hoping that I wouldn't notice
Turns out they had none of the ingredients for the salad that was on the menu, nor did they have the ingredients for the second salad I ordered instead
I ended up paying $10
50 for a plate of lettuce
I am amazed that this place can afford the monthly rent in Soho with no patrons!
I had the same experience as one of the other reviewers
My friend and I went here for brunch/lunch at about 1pm on a Saturday
The restaurant was fairly empty, and there were enough servers, but we felt completely neglected
Nobody ever came to ask how everything was, or to refill our drinks
At the end of our meal, we had to flag down one of the zombies, er, I mean waiters, for our check
Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, but we still had a below average experience
Went to the Manhattan Bistro for a late lunch
The place was only about 1/5th filled, but we sat at the table for 15 minutes before anyone bothered to give us water
After we got the water, it was another 10 minutes before bread
and finally the waiter taking our order
I ordered a chicken burger (the lunch special of the day) - but lo and behold, when the food comes out (30-40 minutes later, I might add) - there's no chicken burger on my plate
there's a bacon cheeseburger
Didn't have time to get another sandwich made, so I ate it anyways
It was pretty mediocre
worth maybe half of what I paid for it
Don't go here
try Spring Natural down the street for similar fare, with much better service
Prompt service at this quiet soho location
Food was good, quiet ambience would attract some but if you're looking for a loud, happening place, look elsewhere
I agree with whoever called it dead bistro, the staff has no idea, food is at best average
I went here with some friends for a drink and a quick bite and everything was just what I was looking for
highly recommended
French to the core, from the sometimes-snarky service to the always-delicious bistro fare
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene Opened in the mid-'70s, this Prince Street bistro was immediately packed with the city's most fashionable faces; somehow, it's managed to retain its popularity
The minute bar upstairs is impassable on a Friday night, and all three dining rooms require reserving ahead
Servers often appear to be stretched a bit thin
The Food For the price and the Soho location, it would be hard to find the French classics done better
Seafood fares especially well, particularly seared scallops in a buttery soy-madeira sauce, and wild bass in a lovely tarragon-scented broth with fresh peas and mushrooms
Frisee salad topped with cambozola cheese and studded with bacon, partnered with the house pt, is an ideal warm-weather meal
And for those who can't resist, the peppercorn-crusted steak frites does not disappoint, and the frites hold up their end of the bargain as well
This has nothing to do with a bistro
pompous and over the top
I especially did not like the service and being seated in the middle of the way
too expensive for what it delivers
lost it s authenticity a long time ago
As late-night diners, we were treated poorly
Both appetizers arrived cold/luke-warm, which we had to send back, only to have the waiter tell us that one was supposed to be cold
French fries were cold and tasted like they were made 5 hours ago
Main course was okay but nothing to rave about and certainly should not have cost $30
We walked out the door with only a drink in each of us and the bill was still over $100
Don't go here
There are so many other worthy places to spend your money
A friend of mine recommended the place and i have to agree
The food is fantastic
we had a great dinner The service is very good
I will recommend it and be sure i will come back !!
Excellent food, good wine list at decent prices, extremely well accompained caviar, magnificent steak au poivre, i was a little disappointed though by the escargots not being served with shell, service not bad, i was actually expecting worse from other previews, however it turned out quite amicable
- Trendy set, quite a nice place to dine out
I had a magnificent and enjoyable dinner with friends and definitely will go back
-
on a sunday nite ard 8pm, everything on their menu is practically out
ambience is fine
but rating is way way over rated
disappointed since i read raving reviews
the duck dish was good

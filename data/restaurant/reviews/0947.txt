My boyfriend had a perfect steak dish, very reasonably priced at 19
00
The petatou appetizer was very nice, but the escargots were very disappointing
Maybe I'm just spoiled by L'Entrecote in Manhattan
They had no flavor minus a very pungent, bitter after taste
The wine was well-recommended, although the waiter did initially try to steer us toward something three times as expensive
For dessert, I'll forgive the lukewarm creme brulee given the late hour
Hopefully they're more careful about the temperature at a more reasonable time of night
Were the food in any way extraordinary, it might excuse the rude greeting by the owner, the remakably bad service, the interminable wait, the lukewarm arrival of the food
Such as it is, Belleville consists of a meal born of high expectations sadly unmet
This restaurant has a great feel to it
The food is always served quickly and is amazingly delicious
The service is good, but not great
I dined at Belleville and my meal was distrupted by the manager yelling at the wait staff in the middle of the dining room
It was far from a pleasurable experience
On Saturday, my wife and I had nothing in the refrigerator and the sotres were closed due to the blizzard
We decided to try Belleville, which is located near where we live here in The Slope
When we entered, we were greeted by a Vietnamese man who spoke fluent French to my wife, who is also Vietnamese
We were immediately seated and enjoyed a dinner in which the preparation of the food was only surpassed by the attention delivered to us by the wait staff
We recommend Belleville without qualification
And we are returning there before the next snow storm
I am a regular here, but
Not only did we wait almost an hour for a table for 4 (even though we made a reservation), we were literally kicked out by the matredi
He gave us a stupid excuse later, and try to apologize but too late
We were there to celebrate a birthday and even when the waitress brought me the chocolate torte, she just put it out there with the candle and didn't say anything, not even realizing that just as she turned around the candle went off
It was the worst time I have ever have there
I love the food, LOVE those french fries, the steak,
It also seems that they have change the whole staff, I was there last saturday, and I couldn't find any of the familiar faces and friends I made there
They have a cold new matredi and new wait staff
Just went last weekend for a birthday brunch with 20 friends
The staff was friendly, attentive and did not stress one bit
Very accomodating and very delicious
Highly recommended
the grilled yellow fin tuna and roasted chicken were amazing
top it off with their warm chocolate tort with coffee ice cream!!! to die for!! best of all, reasonable prices
The bar at the top of the Bentley Hotel at 62nd and York is a welcome addition to the Sutton Place neighborhood
Although the hotel seems to attract mostly visitors from outside the tri-state area, the penthouse bar gives local visitors a spacious hangout to view the city from almost all angles while having enough elbow room to relax and throw back a few cold brews
The bar staff are friendly and engaging and set the mood with background beats from the Dead and Santana and current RB
I live across the street and can't resist popping in on a weekly basis to indulge in their awesome appetizers, including some of the best hot wings in the city
It's worth a visit whether you live in the neighborhood or are just looking for a new place to entertain friends and enjoy the bridge and city views
Great views of 59th Street Bridge East River! Cool outdoor space on three sides of the building
Good appetizers bar food
It's a great place to grab drinks on a warm night rather than fighting the crowds at other outdoor bars
The Scene The East Village isn't yet accustomed to restaurants this serious: Handsomely and discreetly designed, with deep-gray walls, white tablecloths and fine wine glasses, it's a bit precocious on Avenue A, even given the casual vibe
Though dinner prices are moderate, there's a reserve wine list, a polished, upscale feel--and most diners at least seem monied
The Food The rich, muscular Italian dishes are profoundly satisfying
Fresh fettuccine tossed in a luxurious, tender meat ragu is hearty yet delicately flavored; pappardelle with mushrooms and tomatoes tastes very fresh, with perfect texture
A starter of bresaola with black truffles aims to please and succeeds; likewise beautifully soft and succulent fried baby artichokes
The kitchen's sure hand gives whole baked branzino a buttery smoothness
Desserts, including tiramisu and chocolate mousse cake, conclude the meal on a high note
I have been to Cantinella at least a dozen times now and felt compelled to write a review
The owner Ramone is by far the best host I have ever had at a Restaurant
If you speak with him once he will remember you forever
He recently close the restaurant so my girlfriend could throw my surprise 30th birthday there
The food is amazing and reasonable for the quality
The cheescake is a amazing
You will not regret eating there
Tell Ramone Chris sent you
Was there this past weekend 6/25/05
Wonderful place
Perfect for a date or soemthing more casual
Service was outstanding
Ramone (owner) was very hospitable and chatted with the guests
That's always nice
Food was great
I recommend the shrimp fra diavlo
will be back many more times
oh music was very cool too
Felt like I was at a chic dinner party in Italy!
After several trips to Cantinella, I can assure you that your food will be GREAT (if a little pricey) and the service will be impeccable
Menu items tend to be a better value than specials ( just as tasty)
Waiters offer great wine recommendations and don't just try to get you to buy an expensive bottle
For dessert try the Italian Cheesecake, it will have you running back for more
Don't get me wrong, it's nice not fighting my way into a crowded restaurant to get seated
But when my party dined on Sunday night, we were the only people there
The food excellent, prices good, and service is wonderful
This place is a hidden gem
despite the unbelievably delicious and authentic italian food in the east village, cantinella has always been able to hold its own and in my opinion food-wise its tied for first with perbaco
But in the ambience department it has always been my favorite because they bucked the downtown trend of tableclothless tables and offered crisp white table linens
So i was pretty dismayed yesterday when i went and the tables were bare!!! Fortunately the food was still as good if not better so i still left satisfied
i If the proprieters read this review, a humble request from a big fan of your restaurant- stop tryin to be like those downtown hipsters and give us back the tablecloths
Dont change a thing with the food and service
I had a long time w/o going 2 CANTINELLA
I was SURPRISE 2 SEE IT'S NEW FACE-LIFT
IT LOOKED GREAT B/4; BUT NOW, IT looks even BETTER
(old world)
DA place still feels HOMEY while they PLAY DA HOTTEST SEDUCTIVE MUSIC
GREAT RELAXED MOOD
DA FOOD as I remember; HAS ALWAYS BEEN YUMMY, BUT I WAS SO IMPRESSED when our WAITER RAN-OFF 2 BUY ME MINT FOR MY MOJITO
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCE ANY SERVICE LIKE THAT B/4
HOW
SWEEEET! TOTALLY MADE MY NITE
Cantinella is a great find
I have been eating here since it opened (I loved the chef at the restaurant they came from)
The food has never disappointed me and the service gives you that feling of eating in someones private home
Ask for Ramon and he will take care of you
Went for Valentine's day and didn't know what to expect
From the moment we walked in, it all came together nicely
Lighting and music were just right
Service was consistent and on the ball

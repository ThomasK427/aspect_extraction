My steak was delicious and cooked as i ordered it and my date gave the thumbs up to her fish
The people there were friendly and efficient
Most importantly, we were able to get a table without a reservation and still make Aida ( a great play imho)
This is a very nice looking and comfortable place
However our waiter told us that the cappuccino machine was broken
Meanwhile another waitress had tables that asked for cappuccinos 10 minutes after we asked for ours - and they got them! My companion went to the bathroom and overheard the waiter singing near the back of the place The cappuccino machine is broken, It's broken
as some sort of joke
We asked to speak with a manager but no one ever showed up
In a nutshell this place is unmanaged - the staff's agenda is all that seems to matter
With so many places that hire professional help in this city
Who needs this?
went for dinner last week
Good crowd, nice ambiance
Good looking place all around
Me and my friend split the crab cakes and the lollipop prawns - both were scrumptious
The waitress was prompt most of the time and was knowledgable about what was good on the menu
Dinner was a chicken dish that was great but the portion was small
My friend got the steak which was over cooked a little
But both were loaded with great flavor
The happy hour crowd at the bar was mostly just out of worker blowing off steam
Only drawback was the chef who continuously tried to get our phone numbers
Maybe that's why the steak was well? All in all we'd fully reccommend this place for good food and drinks in a great setting in a neighborhood that has not much going on
My girlfriends and I sampled several of the small plates and found everything to be enjoyable
The staff was friendly and warm
There was a party on the lower level, but that didn't disturb our dining experience
I would recommend this restaurant; a new gem for the city
Had dinner with my wife there recently
The crab cakes are a great starter, and my wife's salmon was delicious, as was my steak
I highly recommend it
The Scene White-brick walls, cool cement floors, communal wood-plank tables stained dark chocolate and a crimson ceiling that fades in the dim candlelight--this is one of those rooms that makes everyone look and feel more attractive than they did before they walked in
Sit at the bar and chat with the efficient and attitude-free bartenders, or snatch the four-stooled bar along the front window
The Draw Melissa O'Donnell--whose restaurant Salt marries subtle romance and lush food--has done it again, this time with an impressive menu of affordable snacks to pair with wine or cocktails
Don't miss the dates wrapped in bacon, baked until they taste like salty, crisp candy; the satisfying chicken liver pt or the beef Wellington with mushrooms and balsamic-vinegar sauce
The best cocktail is an intriguing hibiscus tea martini, which substitutes bourbon for gin and has just a tinge of sweet vermouth
Salt bar is really geared more towards drinks and light foods, and it's a great trendy scene and very lively
But they really shouldn't put their entrees in bowls if the light levels are going to stay so low, as the food just looks like a dark glob of mush
I couldn't even eat my chicken because I couldn't see how to cut it, and it is completely unappetizing to have a bowl full of dark stuff that you can't see sitting in front of you
I took the food home, and once I could see it, it tased pretty good
The appetizers are great, esp the dates in bacon (and they are on a plate and spaced out enough so that you can actually make out the form of the food in the low light!)
The Scene Yujin is as cleanly designed and chic as the frosted bottles of Voss water it serves
From the quietly impeccable service to the low buzz of the martini aficionados at the bar, the mood is modern Zen
Just be sure to look up and marvel at the artful ceiling, made of an amalgamation of hundreds of chopsticks
The Food There's no need to slump into a well-known comfort zone of teriyaki and udon
Start with short ribs braised into succulent perfection, or buttery soft shell crabs
A good bet among entrees is the salty miso-marinated salmon, balanced by greenmarket-fresh broccoli rabe
Sushi combinations are fresh, if a bit predictable
Cap off the night with an intensely aromatic cup of lychee tea, tangy lime sorbet or the warm matcha-tea creme brulee
Very beautifully done for a reasonably priced restaurant I was really excited to try this place
The decor is modern, simplistic and beautiful
The service is excellent and attentive
However, the food I'm sorry to report is average
All the items ordered were good but not excellent
I would definately try this place but I would probably be more inclined to go back because I thought it was pretty
A great plus is the dessert
I had fried cheesecake with ice cream on the side
A spin on fried ice cream but equally yummy so maybe this can be a dessert spot
when i first walked by i thought it was a movie set but upon finding out they served food as well, i had to stop in
the ambience and decor is top notch and on par with the great sushi restaurants in ny
its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for
food is eclectic and beautiful
sadly, the service was horrible
Fortunately we were in good spirts so it was all laughable, but I had to actually go get menus to birng to out table myself as we had asked the waiter 3x to no avai
Food was good, but your lucky if you even get it
I went to Yujin last tuesday with couple of my friends for dinner and we all LOVE the restaurant now
I had Tuna Tartar which was the best I've ever had in the city
Chef's Sashimi was also fantastic with fresh fish
My friends recommend Rock Shrimp Dumplings, heavenly roll (it's humongous!!!) and Tuna Steak
Also, you should try their drinks
they have usual offerings of Saketini and all but our favorite drink was blueberry cosmo!! with the dessert of green tea cake with apricot compote, the blueberry cosmo was just heavenly
they also have other cool drinks like coconut lemonade and fantastic apple martini
Overall, we had a great time at the place and we recommend it
P
S
One of my friend told me that last few times she's been, she's spotted Meryl Streep, John Lezgumo and other famous people
Exciting!
Couple girlfriends and I went on a Friday night and it was unusually quiet
I like the ambience which is very fusion style
Food and service are alright
While it wasn't a particular impressive meal since we went with high expectations, it is a decent Japanese restaurant
The ambiance I think is a bit over-rated, but nice
The wait staff was a little stuffy
But I'm not there to eat the staff or the decor
The food is delicious, nice presentation, very fresh
Worth giving it a shot
Recommend for a date
Yujin is without a doubt the best Japanese restaurant I've ever eaten at
And unlike most Japanese restaurants, desserts are actually top-notch
Try the chocolate cake
I've eaten there twice now
The first time, I just had the sushi, which was incredible
The second time, I also ordered a tuna steak, which was very good too
If you don't like raw fish, try the beef steak
My wife ordered it and I thought it was fantastic
The service was very prompt and courteous
Overall, a great experience
my friend had her birthday dinner at Yujin last sat, and I must say after one dinner, Yujin has become our favorite restaurant in the city
The food was amazing; the soft shell crab is to die for
sushi and sashimi tasted soo good and FRESH!!! (and light!!!) oh and the banana/chocolate cake
yum!  we first thought that the cake would be bit unusual after sushi but it was heavenly
The waiting staff were all so friendly and they really knew the menu to heart; they knew everything about all the wines in the menu and the ingridients used in each dish

The tables are a bit close together, but the food is great
What a great evening
From the wine and food recomendations to the superb food, they know how to take care of you
I take my clients and my friends
Dont leave without trying any of the pastas
I was here several months ago, just after the restaurant opened
It was fabulous
I just went last week, and I'm sorry to say they are losing it drastically
The food is still great, other than that -- what a nightmare
We had to wait 45 minutes, WITH a reservation and it was only a weeknight
The wine list is more extensive and expensive and more bland
The sommelier was annoying and extremely unhelpful
The appetizer took forever to get there and then are entrees came before we had finished them
I think the Chef here has a great thing going and knows his food
I think they need to get their act back together and showcase this a little better
I'm spending way too much money to be annoyed
I won't go back, and would highly caution my friends about the place as well
What a wonderful restaurant with a unique menu
Unfortunately the waitress was horrific, and the sommelier doesn't have a clue about Italian wines
That shouldn't be the case when you're spending a few hundred dollars for meal
I prefer dining on the second floor (as opposed to the ground level)
The space is larger and the atmosphere is more relaxed
It's a bit unoriginal to order the squab, but it is a very fine dish
Fiamma is now my favorite spot in NYC
I have been four times over the past year and each and every time I walk out of there I can't believe how good my meal was
The pastas are exceptional, the fish very flavorful as is the meat and desserts are a special treat
The wine list is wonderful, but pricey
While this is an expensive dining experience, it is always memorable, which can't often be said about other NY restaurants of the same $$ league
Fiamma is well worth it!
Fiamma continues to set the bar extremely high for Italian restaurants in the US
The decor straddles intimate and formal such that its a setting that will work very well for a romantic dinner or business engagement
The service is knowledgeable and attentive
The wine selection is exceptionally deep, though a bit pricey
FIAMMA IS ALL ABOUT THE FOOD
There is no Italian restaurant in NY that can compete with Michael White's cuisine
His pastas are exceptional and extremely fresh - try the various raviolis and the Stracci
The fish is very fresh and delicately prepared, and the Veal Chop is flavorful but not too large and overwhelming
The flavors are the key and they are diverse, subtle, and memorable
Importantly, Chef White does not make the mistake that so many Italian restaurants in the US do by over complicating the cuisine
Great Italian cuisine is simple, yet flavorful
Bravo!
My parents and I dined here last week and had a lovely time
Our server was available and attentive, the sommelier was helpful and engaging, and the food was excellent! The atmosphere was chic: dining rooms on 3 stories with red, black, and candlelight motif
It is a restaurant for a special occasion
we had a wonderful time, and would love to go back!
I was impressed with how well we were attended to at the restaurant
The food was good, but nothing spectacular
Loved the atmosphere and the extensive wine list
Come here to wow yourself
There is hip bar to drink at to coll you down
The atmosphere is the best I've seen
It has hip, chasian look, even though its italian
I had a great grilled octopus for appetizer, and we all shared some pasta, and I had te Cod for Dinner
Very light
They have a good dessert menu, however it is lacking, chocolate my favorite
I would defiantely recommend
The only thing Italian about this restaurant is the name fiamma or flame
The wine list is large but ridiculously overpriced, and just because truffles are an Italian delicacy, it doesn't mean you should be putting them on every dish
There are a few good Italian restaurants in this city but this is not one of them
However, if you are BT please go
Fiamma's pasta with lobster and shrimp is excellent as is the Swordfish dish
Never have I had swordfish as good as this, probably the tastiest thus far
I do not care for the bass or the pasta with shaved truffles
Great atmosphere and great neighborhood you can go to the Thompson hotel for drinks prior and when it gets warmer on the rooftop bar
The room on the 3rd floor is the absolut perfect spot for a private party do hip and great service
It serves decent italian food, has great service, and spots a clean, comtemporary decor
but it feels generic -- lacking in character and passion
My dining experience here was pleasant enough but this is not a restaurant I would feel compel to come back for another visit
It never drew me in from the moment I stepped into the foyer
Found it to be the ideal way to cap off an alternative day
Saw an independent film (Morvern Callar), finished off an independent book (Only in America by John Soltez)
met a couple friends here and capped off the alternative day
What a change from the expected -- first off, the Fiamma makes for a nice alternative cocktail, and the Garganelli plate reminded me of nothing I'd had before
Earthy, not too garlicky
Even the shrimp departed from the standard scampiness you're all too used to encounter
At the risk of sounding expected, I'll say save room for dessert, again a departure from the standard Tirami towers
A different take on the cuisine that costs a little more, but worth it if you want something fresh
This sleek Italian has superb pasta,fish service
Great selection of Italian wines
First of all, the signature drink, the Fiamma, is awesome
Secondly, the Garganelli with shaved black truffles is one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had
Lastly, from the first call with the reservationist to our waiter, the service is outstanding
I highly suggest Fiamma!
The food was just average
I ordered the pasta dish with shrimp and lobster
The shimp had an awful Iodine taste
You would think at those prices that you would get fresh seafood
My boyfriend has the braised short ribs which were tasteless
I definitely would NOT recommend this place
Since prices in NYC are usually so high, it's a rare treat to actually get what you pay for when dining
However, Fiamma delivers
The place is bustling but dark and intimate at the same time, like a low buzz throughout the room
Our appetizer of 1/2 portioned pasta with lobster was delicious
Although we didn't notice, the host apologized for the entree taking too long
To make up for it, he gave us a plate of fresh parmesan and asiago with golden raisins and bread which was delicious
Our main courses were both amazing (braised beef and striped bass) and the desert was also delicious and gratis
The courtesy of the staff impressed us and the food wowed us
Great place
As someone wrote earlier, the Fiamma cocktail is really good
I had the ox-tail ravioli to begin

I was at spice grill last nite for downtown pre fixe dinner
enjoyed the dinner very much
I ordered the chicken Tikka masala and the bengali fish curry the best I have eaten so far
I donot agree with the previous rating
I think the service was excellent and the staff was very friendly, they helped me to pick the dishes
I m glad we had our dinner @ spice grill
will deffinately go again and I highly recomend
Amazing! I just love the food
It's superb!! Really pretty setting
OVER MAX
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion
try the potato stuff kanish best one
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good
Dessert is a joke
dont bother
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect
they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine
You must try the shrimp appetizers
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
The best Indian food I have eaten,by far
The shrimp toast is mind blowing never eaten something like this diah in any Indian restaurant
Ambiance is very classy and romantic with high cielings and antique lamps
service is wonderfull
best place for good food and perfect evening with some one especial
will eat there again and again
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there
Spice Grill is the space formerly occupied by Tiffin, which went bust due to financial fall-out from 9/11
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled
Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices
Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs
Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown)
Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops
Drove in all the way from Long Island
The decor is OK but the food is absolutely awesome
Do not go here if you are cheap or expect to spend less than $150 for dinner for two
The homemade Grapa tasted like gasoline but I guess some people like that
Otherwise, one of the best Italian restaurants around
You have to try it to believe it
The decor, food, attention, wine, and presentation makes this restaurant a MUST
I've been to Nobu, Le Bernardin, Jean Georges, Daniel, Spice Market and a hundred other restaurants in NYC
This restaurant is the best
High end
Sophisticated
Wonderful food - they will peel your lobster for you so you don't have to lift a finger
World Class wine
And the waiters are the best I have ever seen
They will either do 'flawlessly senior and invisible' or 'movie-star charismatic entertainment, Tony Soprano style', whatever you want
It really should be Zagat No 1
The only negative reviews about this restaurant are from cheap people
If you want cheap food dont go here
But, if you wish to dine nicely, you will be forever hooked with this place
Best in city
Fantastic atmosphere, delicious Northern Italian cuisine, and the homemade grappa is perfecto
Wait staff make for a memorable experience (you've got to hear them sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY!)
All in all a wonderful -- albeit pricey -- experience
And the pannetones at Christmastime add the perfect final touch
WARNING -- it can get to be a bit noisy, especially with the vaulted ceiling
Food excellent but very expensive
The most disturbing part is how they try to hide the prices and try to take advantage of you
They first present the menu verbally hoping that you will not request menus and then provide a menu on request with prices penciled in
When its time for dessert, they don't provide dessert menus and once again present it verbally
On the bill, dessert prices came on the bill as only a total lump sum
I needed to ask them to break it down
The desserts were very good and the price equally impressive
A Strawberry flambe for 2 is $36
Tirami Su is $10 each
Regular coffee is approximately $4
By far THE best Itlaian food in Manhatten
It's a special restaurant and the perfect date place
It's also great with family and friends
They serve you app's before you even order so beware and pace yourself
Love the Sea bass with a light caper and tomate sauce! Very nice bar and the most beautiful decor
Very dim and sexy! Can't wait to go back
If you enjoy fine dining and good Italian food and want to impress a girl, bring her here
I looked in Zagat for something in Tribeca and boldly took a stab at this place
I must say I was pleasantly surprised
The extemely friendly staff waited on us hand and foot (they don't even give you a menu they read it to you)
The portabello mushroom apatizer was amazing, the pasta dishes were quite delectable and I strongly recommend the banna flambe desert (cooked right at your table)
Overall it was a great time and the food wasn't the best italian I've had, but it's good enough to keep coming back
For 2 people with drinks, appatizer, entree and desert it was $350
00 (Includes Tip)
Vistied with a party of six on a Sat night
Place is lovely to look at, nice bar, high ceilings
We sat down and immediately waiters danced around us with niblets of cheese, zucchini and other so-so goodies, which was a nice touch
However the rest of the evening was marred by inconsistent dishes and one obnoxious waiter
When grilled meats are pepared tableside the place fills with so much smoke you need a gas mask
Again, all show
Wine list is overpriced with only a few bottles under $100
Basically this place is a wanna-be Il Mulino and falls woefully short
Go to Il Giglio one block south on Warren for a better experience
Excellent food - the rack of lamb is to die for
Absaolutly outstanding

Also, it is important to note that Ideya -- hands down -- serves the best Mojito I've ever had
Overall, the food is above average but not to die for -- you're going more for the drinks and the fun atmosphere than a 5-star Cuban dining experience
I should note I've never been on a weekend night -- we're talking about SoHo after all -- it might be crowded
I stop by one evening and at the end of the night realized that for the price of 1 Malta I could buy 21 at your local Pathmark
For the price I paid for a cup of Bustelo coffee w/milk I could buy 2 vacumed packs for 3 bucks
Only a moron with no knowledge of lower east side would pay to eat at this OVER priced corner grocery food so called spanish restaurant
Only downside was being so loud you needed to scream to be heard
There was a 20 person b-day party in the small back room
Great food, great service
Would love to go back
I went on Saturday night with a group of 7
We had reservations for 8:30 and were seated promptly
Overall, the food was delicious
But the service was extremely poor
The waiter rarely checked on our table, an appetizer was forgotten, and one of the entrees came out ice cold
To top if off, the snotty hostess told us that we needed to hurry up and leave 2 minutes after we had gotten the bill (on a hefty tab, I might add) because another group was waiting for our table
Had a very pleasant experience at Ideya
Brought a date here, had asked for a good table and they honored the request with a cozy corner table for two
All in all, the service was fantastic, very nice people, and food that was very well priced
Not ultra-gourmet, but solid tasting and not over-priced
There was a lively crowd that made the restaurant bustle with energy - all in all, an excellent experience
I went to dinner at Ideya and had a wonder time
The meal begins with wonderfully salty plantain chips, which I ate too many of
We ordered a very large (both in price and in size) pitcher of mojitos, which were delicious
By the end of the pitcher all 4 of us were feeling very good
The appetizers we good, but the skirt steak with Chimeichurra sauce, and the tuna were both delicious
It was the best skirt steak I have had in recent memory, and I do love (and frequently eat) a good steak
In conclusion, I would certainly return to Ideya, and order the skirt steak again, without hesitation
I highly recommend it
I had brunch at Ideya the other day and nearly flipped my lid at how great it was
We were able to just roll in and order and eat in no time
The Huevos Ideya was insane
It's like a Latin style eggs Benedict, only theirs has one of the best tasting hollandaise sause I have ever tasted
They even put corn bread down on the table to much on, yummmm
I just dig that place
The service was great, very cool and laid back
I'll be there next week for sure
my wife and I went on a Thursday eve and the place was filled with beautiful people and the flow of passerbys on the sidewalk outside was like a modeling show! The food was very fresh, even the salsa with chips tasted like they just prepared it
Loved the dark mojito! Service was good for a busy night
walked into ideya again after my review felt kinda guilty thought i was a bit too hard on the restaurant
sorry just didnt work out - it is a cuban /latin american place right so why do u spice the food the way gringos would like it ???????? dont make the food bland - the flavour should explode in your mouth
consistancy on the cocktails too please
With early summer in the air, my girlfriend I ducked out of work early (noon!) on a recent Fri
with the express purpose of quaffing a mohito or three having a lite bite
Had walked past Ideaya for years but hadn't stopped before
Known for best mohitos in NYC, so we bee-lined it there
Sat at the open front windows
Clean, bright airy; friendly, funny staff; cool mix of Latin tunes reggae
Tasty grilled shrimp salad; an OK roast pork Cuban sandwich; superb plantains (cooked dark gooey, like I used to get 'em in Tampa)
Was it the rounds of hand-mashed mohitos or was the staff actually getting friendlier / funnier by the minute? Prices weren't bad for the happenin' Soho locale
Have recommended Ideya to others want to go back
The food, drink, and ambiance are definitely above average but only go here if you want to be poked by the server when he wants to take your drink order (and I was paying attention!)
And then he'll forget to bring your drink every time you order one, won't pay attention to your table of 8, will give you unwarranted attitude, and never be friendly or smile
For this you get 20% gratuity automatically added to your bill!
A friend suggested this place and I went in last night for dinner
The girasol was addictive, just what I was in the mood for
We had some apps, the grouper fingers and taquitos were so good we were fighting over them
I had the lomito, which was more than I could eat after all those apps
I recommend the mojitos big time, but I would sample all of it, everything we had was so full of flavor
Chocolate tres leches cake topped it off wit a cafe con leche to get me going for the evening
stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and had an unexpectedly good meal
we tried a little bit of everything, and were pleased overall, especially with the mojitos
looking forward to going back to try their winter menu!
I choose this place for a birthday dinner not knowing what I was coming into
I made reservations a day or so prior and got seated promptly on a Fri
night
Try to come before 8pm or it'll start getting packed
The drinks are overrated! All the liquor is bottom shelf and there was no spark in the drinks
I did not try the mojitos but all the other margaritas sunsets, we're mediocre
Don't get wine if you like to drink out of regular glasses
There is too much hype about this place
Waitstaff was not much when choosing a good entree for us
But the best part of this whole place IS the food
The pork chops are delicious and the red snapper isn't dry ( I recommend)
The portions are quite small but good enough
Overall, don't expect much, just good food
A PITCHER OF MOJITOS FOR $35?!?! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!  For an appetizer I had the curry chicken w/plantain fritters I do believe it was and it was EXCELLENT! And I don't even like curry! But the balance of flavors was perfect
Will definitely go there again! I went there w/a group of 7 people and they accomodated us fine and we had good service
I came here for mojitos only
I ordered a grande and it seemed like I got a pequino
I found it strange that the barkeep went straight for the well liquor for making their signature drink
The first mojito was very tasty
This beverage is made so many different ways it seems to taste different every place I go
What confused me was that the second mojito made by the same barkeep tasted completely different
That left me unimpressed
Consistency is important for any bar
It was a nice place to relax and not crowded when I was there
The food is above average, though the portions a tad small, even for tapas; but they more than make up for it with their wonderfull mojitos
The service is friendly and reliable; great place to stop by on a hot summer day
Our party of 14 was forced to crowd around Ideya's tiny, cramped bar and wait, and wait, and wait
We were finally seated 45min late, without so much as an apology from the unconcerned host (all the more infuriating because I had been curtly warned when making the reservation that we would not be seated until everyone had arrived and that our table would only be held for 20min
) By this point everyone was hot, hungry, and grumpy
The pitchers of sangria helped put us all back into a festive mood-- until we got the check and discovered the price: $40/pitcher! The food was unremarkable: generally good, but lacking the spice and flair of more memorable cuban/latin cuisine
Also, I was expecting a varied tapas-style menu and was disappointed to find a traditional appetizer/entre arrangement far less suitable for sharing
In short, this restaurant is not worth the wait
A friend planned a birthday party there for 16
After having to here the hostess be completely bitchy during the planning process about the whole party arriving on time, etc, they forced us to wait for 1 hour before seating us with no apology or consolation - very poor planning on the part of the restaurant, but handled in a completely unprofessional manner
The food was average, but the drinks were strong AND expensive
We were forced to make the best of a situation ruined by the hostess
very good--and sweet and STRONG--mojitos! the atmosphere is lively and fun

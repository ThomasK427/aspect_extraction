Stay away from the mashed potatoes, do try the chicken parm and the pasta vodka is a must have
I have been ordering from this restaurant for many years and pizza is great as well as the dinners they serve
The price is well worth a trip or even delivery
When i feel like dining, this restaurant is very comforting and the service is great
Never had a problem with this restaurant
I have no problems with coupons when I order
We ordered delivery pizza
They wouldn't honor our coupon upon arrival even though they approved it on the phone
The cheese was gritty
The toppings were strangely bitter or sour
The pizza was so greasy that there was nothing left on the burnt crust when it arrived at our door
We threw away more than half the pizza because the smell alone was nauseating
The rest of the food may be great, but we won't be the ones to find out
:-(
Although it is not the nicest place to look at from the inside, the food is excellent!! Wonderful salads with great blue cheese, and the steaks are to die for
If you don't like salt this place isn't for you
You won't leave one bite of steak on your plate
This place was bar none one of the worst steak houses I have ever went to
There is nothing inviting about this hole in the wall
It is dark, dingy and more like a truck stop bar than a restaurant
Thats just the looks
The food is even worse
Your steaks arent grilled they are broiled, and even if you like that sort of thing there is no way you are going to like the sauce your steak comes drenched in
The only thing I can compare it to is Soy Sauce
Its just that salty
Bring a gallon of water with you
If that isnt bad enough the meat isnt even that cheap
The Filet Minion that my wife had, which was way overcooked for Med
Rare, was $20
Oh and by the way the steaks are served with French fries, what about the baked potatoes!!!
A standard, but good, salad bar and similar wine list
This place shines when your steak or prime rib arrives - excellent selection, cooked to perfection, and sized too large to eat at one sitting making it perfect for saving the remainder for lunch tomorrow
The best damn restaurant in the NY/NJ/Conn metro area
The quality, portion and price far exceed any other establishment in the area
From the Appetizers to the Main Dishes to the Infinite Wine List and Amazing Deserts (Key Lime Pie and Carrot Cake are First Rate!!), The Park Orchard is first rate!!
An outstanding menu with great variety
Although the chef avoids red meats, you won't even notice that unless you are in the market for steak for two or something of the sort
The wine list is outstanding as well
The tables can be crowded and the ambience noisy
No reservations taken and waits can be long if you arrive after 6:30 so plan to go early
This is the best Spanish restaurant I've been to so far and surpassing many in NYC
The food was genuinely perfect as well as the drinks and service
I had a New York prime steak and it was amazing
The first time I never ordered dessert because I was too satisfied
Just order a nice after dinner
Great Night for food and drink with music very good on Sunday Nights for those who like something different
The restaurant is VERY GOOD
I took my best friend there last week for her birthday
They have a piano player that was playing Christmas Carols as well as a waiting area that it very much like a comfy, well designed living room! The waitress and the ower were all very nice, helpful and attentive
The food was excellent
Everything was seasoned to perfection
I hade the BBQ chicken and shrimp combo, which was EXCELLENT
I highly recommend it
My friend had the seafood
Great!!!! The atmosphere is very laid back with low lighting, candles and mellow colors
It is also an excellent location for a date
I would definitley recommend it
I thought this place would be your prototypical diner, the food was a lot better and you definetly get your money's worth
I saw a review on here that is very old so I thought I'd put a new one
I have been coming at least once a week since shortly after they opened
And I liked it when it opened and it has just gotten better
The owner are great and one of them is always there
The food is outstanding and the beers are always spot-on
If they ever close like the last reviews says, not only will I be surprised but heartbroken
it's had to find a place that is cosistantly as good as this place
Order the full slab, and you will not regret it
A casual place to enjoy a Friday night
The food here is awesome
The prices reasonable and you won't leave here hungry
Another plus for me, and people like me, wheelchair access
Not to be crass, but people with disabilities do use bathroom facilities
We can do so here
Great family atmoshere, too
Come to the Mark Twain Diner/restaurant hungry, and leave full and satisfied
In Short This offshoot of a popular New Orleans hangout for politicians features decor of dark woods and comfortable booths, with a separate bar scene
Choice cuts of custom-aged beef arrive in sizzling butter on 500-degree plates
The menu also offers chicken, pork and seafood entrees along with Creole appetizers like shrimp remoulade
Family-style sides include gargantuan onion rings, creamed spinach and various styles of potatoes
Traditional homemade desserts like cheesecake and bread pudding conclude the meal
The service was wonderful
we got a window seat and was able to see the water which was real nice
I can't even tell you how nice, prompt and professional our server was
The food was really great, but you have to order sides or you will just get a steak on a plate! Literally
The cheapest steak was 31
00 and thats just the steak
I ordered a side of broccoli and my boyfriend ordered mashed potatoes
The portions were pretty good, but for 9 bucks a side it better have been a good size! The steak itself-i had the filet-was delicious! So tender! My boyfriend had the ny strip $40 which was big, but no where as tender
I think youR better off getting the filet for $33
Salad's were real good
That doesn't come with the steak either
Great service, great dinner
just be prepared to order everything separate
Deciding that it was time to take a break from being a vegetarian I had Ruth's Chris in mind for a night of 'sin'
I had the Petite Filet-not wanting to shock my system
The meat lacked the taste my nose had hoped for
I knew asking for the A-1 was out of the question so I dealt with it
They sat myself us in the back of the restaurant-away from the noise that I hadn't expected of the dimly lit restaurant
Argubly the best seat in the house-we did feel castaway
Great wine selection, good desert, but the friendly service would warrant another trip
Hey its better than Sizzlers!

And, btw - it's great for just your average night of dinner or dancing, as well!
the margaritas were outrageous!!!!! great music and dancing!!!! fabulous place to get crazy with your girls!!!!
my friends recommended me iguana, it wasn't disappointment at all
food and a service vas great
especially the hungarian hostess was very friendly and helpful
but most of all the drinks vere outstanding
hm
delicious frozen margaritas
and the food
the place looks really nice, especially for romantic night!!?? l think is the right place to be, to eat out
I highly recommend Iguana for excellent Mexican cuisine, a friendly fun and warm atmosphere and great service
I love the frozen margaritas, and the guacomole which was prepared at our table to our liking
My friends and I enjoyed dancing in the lower level lounge to great music after dinner
I can't speak for Iguana's bar scene or the downstairs lounge, but after my Saturday night dinner experience, I would never recommend a meal here
Iguana's gaudy decor, boring menu, high prices and harried service were clearly intended for the pre-theater crowd
As for the music, what can I say - they played Celine Dion - the music made it inescapable
While the frozen margaritas were tasty, they were so strong our table of 4 adults couldn't finish 1 pitcher
Finally, the $10 guacamole was bland and the $20 entrees were mediocre at best
I would rate my experience at Iguana one of the most disappointing meals I've had in my 7 years in New York
Seating was prompt (5pm) Not sure who waiter is
No menus after 30 minutes of waiting
I asked for a cafe con leche and got a cafe latte with cinnamon
Then was given an artificial sweetener and no sugar which to me said, you don't need sugar
I would have preferred to make that decision
When we complained to the manager about the service, he asked us what WE wanted him to do for us
I thought he should have just offered something
I told him I may be back with my husband in the future
He just gave me his card and huffed away
We're not sure what we did to offend these people
I may go back to give them another chance but it's not probable
The food was good although I thought it a little more than moderately priced
They have chicken fingers for the kids
I went with a friend and we both had an incredible time
There were so many good looking girls that we thought, why haven't we been coming here all our lives? Great drinks and reasonably priced
The music was a lot of fun
We liked the quesadillas a LOT! If you love Mexican food, look no further
mexican? mexi-freaken-can-tabulous!!!! Like the Iguana (reptile) immediately captures your attention
this fun colorful lounge/restaurant aims to please
the mojitos (especially strawberry flavored) are to be devoured! The guacamole made tableside to your pallette's desire is like a rainbow in your mouth! Don't miss the basement lounge with dark sexy decor and vivacious music to your ears! as a published nyc restaurant/culture critic, with an insatiable apetite, i give this vivacious joint an A++
NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
This is a cool spot in the Theater District instead of the usual Italian place
Very big so its great for groups
The lounge downstairs was the perfect spot to hang and have some cocktails!
The Scene Barely a day goes by without some mention in the gossip columns of what one media figure said to another over lunch at Michael's
If you're the kind of person who knows what Michael Wolff looks like, you'll enjoy the people-watching
For everyone else, the airy, light-filled room--which looks onto a private garden at the back--makes for more than pleasant scenery
The Food The Californian cuisine can be as high-flying as the price points: The seared hamachi with corn fritters, creme fraiche and salmon roe offers an enjoyable mix of textures, and giant slabs of burrata cheese melt pleasingly into yellow tomatoes and baby opal basil
There's also beef carpaccio, 28-day dry-aged prime New York steak, and panko- and nori-crusted ahi tuna rolls
We were seated promptly, had excellent service, there were 2 roses on everyone's table to take home
I had the black cod and it was so delicious
We split a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake
The wines by the glass are wonderful
I wish I had enough money to eat here all the time, not just once a year!
My hotel was across 7th Ave from this branch of Lindy's
Went in one night late after a show for a piece of cheesecake to take back to my room enjoy with a little TV
Had already had the cheesecake at Carnegie Deli, just a block away
Got helped right away, staff seemed friendly
BUT, when I got to my room settled in for my treat-YUCK! I threw it away-did not want to waste the calories
Cheesecake was not as rich creamy as Carnegie's (not as big, either, but that's a good thing!)
Cannot remember if the crust was regular or crumbs, but either way it was tasteless soggy
Okay, the place has the ambience of a transport cafe, but the steaks were big and nicely grilled, the accompaniments were decent enough, the salads fresh and the drinks were quite cheap
And the price - less than $10 for a steak dinner with all the trimmings is amazing value, especially to us Brits who expect to pay double that at home!
HORRIBLE!!!!
THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING
I would never go back and eat there again
As a New Yorker, I try to avoid the touristy parts of mid-town, but this place I would most definitely return to
We tried it after a show, W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L
When we went back it was under contruction, and we were so upset
I have yet to try it since, but guarntee anyone who goes a great meal
Try the Chef's Special seafood and apsta in a pink sauce
mmmmmm! You won't be disappointed
I Love the loudness of the Restaurant
the best place hangout with friend and family to eat at
When I first came to that Restaurant, i know that its cheap and good food
i Really Love the meso soup
I used to buy 3 cases each time I went home would survive on this with fresh cut veggies in my dorm
Now that I am working, I come home to ramen every so often
I prefer this vs
udon or soba
Low class huh?! For value can't be beat, it's as tasty as when I used to cook it up for my roommates!, a great ramen cook I was
Now I let Sapporo do my ramen cooking! And the variety is a big plus
Lousy decor, feels like a greasy spoon out of old chinatown! but hey we're paying for quick tasty eats not the paint job!
I've been eating lunch at Sapporo's for years
Their soups are delicious, hearty concoctions
Particularly satisfying on a cold winter day-- and they have a great cold summer soup during those months when the temperature rises
I've tried at least 5 different soups and never been disappointed
That said, it still pays to read the descriptions carefully, since some of the soups contain odd fishy ingredients that are tough on the average american palate
Disclaimer: I've never had anything except the soups and the gyoza, but friends who have dined with me seemed to enoy their non-soup meals, such as curry rice
This is NOT a good place to bring a date, however
The ambiance leaves much to be desired: rickety furniture, overly-speedy service, and rather ratty looking decor all contribute to the correct impression that this is a DIVE, and not a fine-dining experience
This place is as authentic as the places in St
Mark's but without the ridiculous wait
Although it's known more for a lunch place, you can get the same dinner as the restaurants down in the East Village but without waiting an hour for a table
It's ok
Try the butter soup
The wontons aren't bad
Considering the location on 47th Street, the food here is pretty good and reasonably priced
Although Japanese nationals will find the ramen and other dishes pretty bland, this is one of the better Japanese homestyle restaurants around
For under 8$ near times square, there is little to complain about
Not bad here in New York

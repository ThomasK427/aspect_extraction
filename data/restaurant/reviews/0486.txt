The calorie-conscious can select from a list of Weight Watchers-inspired dishes like mesquite chicken salad and grilled tilapia with mango salsa
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA
I was ecstatic to know that they built one in the Bronx
The most famous item on the menu is the Chicken Riblet basket
I just can't get enough of them!! No matter which location I go to, the customer is always satisfied
Applebee's on Bartow is quick and they are very friendly
I give it two thumns up
FJ Too is smaller, more quaint, but has many of the same things on the menus as the much larger, noiser Pine
Also, the service is much better here
I was invited to Joe's Place by the unofficial Mayor of the Bronx
The first thing that happened when I came in was Joe warmly welcomed me
The restaurant is sectioned - one section is for take out and fast counter dining, another section is for the bar flies, and the largest section is the dining room
The menu is huge and goes on for pages
All your favorites are here - arroz con pollo, pernil, chorizo
The chorizo in wine sauce was to die for
The roast pork, with rice and beans and fried plantains, was enough to feed a family of four
In fact, I took the remainder home with me and it did make next day's lunch for two! For dessert, try this pudding, translated Nipple of Venus
It's like a flan, but with flavored with anise
It looks like a woman's breast
Delicious!
Riverdale finally gets a grown-up restaurant! I can't count the times I;ve been here and it just gets better everytime
The bartenders are friendly and actually know how to make a propoer Cosmo not to mention a killer Green Apple Martini
Pay close attention to the nightly specials - there are some gems - one of my favorite dishes is the softshell crabs fried in a light-as-air egg batter and served simply in a lemon, butter, white wine sauce
Wine list is better than most for the neighborhoos with a great priced Moet
Def
worth not just one visit but many!
When I went on vacatins to New York I totally loved this restaurant and I would recomend it to all my friends
You will never eat a krispy kreme again
People come from all over the country to try these delicious donuts
Get there early!
I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines
I arrived late on a snuday night so there were only 5 donuts left
All they had available was orange donuts?? I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot
I was pleasently surprised at the taste
The orange wasn't overwelming but the frosting and the consistency was perfect
Give it a shot :-)
this is my neighborhood spot for when i don't want to cook, don't want to spend a lot of money, want something i know i will like and always have a good experience
the food is basic american fare, but well done and consistent
one difference -- they make fresh squeezed juice and smoothies
the staff is very nice as well
I love Paul's
Seriously, the new management is fantastic
It's an easy layed back place, with enormous windows that allows for fantastic people viewing year round
the food is marvelous, the brie with honey is DIVINE
the wine list is superb
the comfy room with window seats allows you to relax with a fantastic coffee or cocktail and eat light fare with delicious accents
a true gem in the LES
This place is a little taste of home
For people interested in a mellow hang at a European style cafe, Paul's it it
Cheese Plates, Charcuterie, Foie Gras, Croque Madame, Mozzarella Salad, and the coffee and wine! Everything taste so good
It's my favorite eatery in Manhattan
just the best croque monsieur i've ever found in manhattan
(you have to come before 7pm) however chess games are available all the time
What a great find
After brunch at Essex, my boyfriend and I were meandering around the LES when we stumbled on this place
This is the ideal LES hangout for leisurely afternoon hanging out
Not rushed, great coffee and snacks, friendly service
Feels like Europe in a very authentic, casual way
This cool, little corner eaterie is an absolute delight! Enjoy all the advantages of a contemporary french cafe without the pretentiousness
The snacks, sandwiches and pastries are fresh and are so delicious
The wait staff are surprisingly down to earth and very accomodating
Although the name of the venue is less than to be desired, this place is a definite a tresure for the lower east side
We wandered in last night after a show in the neighborhood and could not have been more pleasantly surprised
The service was absolutely above and beyond, the menu was not huge but the food yummy, the ambience friendly, warm, but very light and easy
Check it out!
Warm, cozy
yummy snacks, the best latte in town pretty people
A true find, only for friendly people
only open four days, the place was super-clean, and the owners were super-nice, on the house warm bread and olive oil and wine were definitely nice touches
i'll definitely be back soon
you should check it out
The Scene There aren't a lot of restaurants smaller than this one, but it makes the most of the space with pretty decorating touches and clever arrangement
Still, some will find romance elusive in such close quarters
A loft full of wine overlooks the dining area, reminding the young couples clientele that beverage is half the experience here
Service is deft and warm
The Food The kitchen sends out imaginative dishes with bright, clean flavors that truly highlight the quality of their seasonal ingredients
A salad of slightly wilted popped corn in meaty olive vinaigrette startles, then pleases; another, of arugula with perfect apple dice, is simple, crunchy and satisfying
A wine-hibiscus reduction tarts up rare, tender venison medallions, and juniper oil does the same for a lush venison consomme
A playful ice cream sandwich made with Rice Krispie treats ends the meal with a bang
So, I am rather new to NYC and my native NYC friend has been gracious enough to introduce me to many restaurants
which I am for ever in debt to her for
However, I was at a charity event where one could bid on various things and the item that caught my attention was a $100 gift certificate that was donated by the Tasting Room
Now, I have never been there, but the description of the place fit the bill
To make a long story short
I won the prize at a dollar value a bit more than what it was worth
but who cares
it was for charity, right?!  Now to the meat of the Tasting Room: So, my native New Yorker friend and I go Tasting Room and we are very impressed by the small/quaint atmosphere
As for the food, we had the Lettuce Salad with Feta, the White Fish and the Roasted Lamball very good and recommended
However, we also had the Porcini Mushrooms and they are worth dying for
Serious
I used to work in a restaurant and I made a point to notice how they made them
I asked my NYC friend what she thought and she responded with I will definitely eat here again
And by the way
they have a GREAT wine selection

My parents grew up in Burma, and I pretty much grew up with Burmese food too (tho I wasn't born there)
Dishes there taste exactly like my mother's cook -- remind me of my childhood when I was living at home back then
Great price, friendly staff, and if you know enough about Burmese food you can even make special requests -- they are very accommodating
I have taken almost every friend of mine there, and they all fall in love with this place -- it all started with the green tea leave salad!!
I live upstairs from this restaurant and can't stop going downstairs for dinner!
this place is great
the food is great
the staff is great
i walk in and they start preparing my food
i am addicted to their lemon chicken
also have the thousand layer bread
not a 'nite out on the town' dinner place, a nice place to have a quiet lunch in a good neighborhood
every one ive introduced to this place loves it
even the kitschy decorations are great!
This place offers unique food, attentive service, and it is very inexpensive
The spices, sauces, and combination of ingredients are delightful; there are elements of Thai, Indian, Vietnamese cuisine, and more
I shall return
The food is hot and delicious (a cross between Indian and Vietnamese) and cheap ($8 and up), the service is friendly, the atmosphere is not a scene, just simple and good
the thousand layered pancake and curried chicken are to die for!
Oh my goodness gracious, Mingala is a delight
From their vegetarian let-thoke salad (try it with lemon!!) to their basil soybean dish to the simple, soothing veggie soups
this place is fantastic
Also, the thousand layer pancake with potato curry---despite it's not having 1,000 layers, really--is super yummy
I've eaten at Mingala Burmese near Astor Place several times and the tastes have always been very good
I highly recommend the Mango Chicken and the Own-No Kow Swear (noodles with chicken in coconut broth)
They'll make it spicier if you wish
The Thousand Layer Pancake is also good
The service is friendly and quick
This is a great restaurant for a date
The atmosphere is perfect and the service is excellent
The wait staff is there when you need them and are not of the pestering type
As for the food, the flavor is rich and is healthy at the same time
You will not find this anywhere!
I decided to check out Mingala Burmese based on the great reviews it got, plus it's in my neighborhood
The food was okay, but I think it isn't as wonderful as the other reviews would suggest
My friend had the shrimp in red curry, which was spicy, colorful, packed with vegetables, and a good size
The chunks of pineapple floating in it looked like they came from a can, which detracted from the dish
I had a chicken rice noodle dish, and despite the description that it was sauteed in a light garlic sauce, I thought it was rather bland -- more like lo mein than anything spicy or special
We ordered the thousand layer bread and the layers seemed dense and greasy
I did like the shrimp dish, but I don't know if I'd seek out their cuisine again
Attentive service
Extremely delicious food
We got the food delivered at work
No one can beat the $4
95 lunch in the city
Must Try!!!!
The food here is great, and the service is fast and courteous, what more could you ask for
And to boot, the price are very good for Manhattan, about $7-8 a dish
The Scene City Crab successfully approximates the good cheer of a seaside lobster house
Go with office mates or take the family--anybody in front of whom you won't be embarrassed to wear a lobster bib
The room is bright, clean and attractive, with huge windows that open to Park Avenue South and a bustling raw bar off to the side
The Food Diners choose from a variety of oysters, crabs, chowders, and seafood standards like crab cakes, catfish and salmon
In addition, there are limited salads and meat dishes for those without a hankering for the sea's bounty
Large side dishes like corn on the cob and french fries are also available, and the wine list offers some impressive bargains
First off, let me say it was not I who paid for the dinner
However, when ordering an entre for over $32
00 one does expect more than three small shrimp, one crab cake and two broiled scallops
This was more appetizer size than anything else
As for taste, you could have blindfolded me and I could not identified the flavor of what I was eating
To say this was a total rip off is an understatement
Poor value and quality for the money
Mainly for tourists and those on unlimited expense accounts
Not for us native New Yorkers who should know better
Now I do and hope to spare others this dismal experience
Filthy Ladies room
Good service, good sorbet, bad seafood
The lump crab meat Napolean
Ridiculous - little mounds of shredded crab meat doused in mayonnaise and not much else piled onto three tomato slices
Lump crab meat should stay in lumps
It was like eating over-priced tuna fish
You'd expect City Crab to know how to prepare and serve crab
service was snobbish, slow and very patronizing
The prices were
shall I put it gently? EXORBITANT! surf and turf almost 50 bucks
a crab cake a a steak 50 bucks
a reg
2 pound lobster would have been 70 dollars
Surely not worth going
place deserves all it's bad reviews
Should have checked citysearch 1st but relied on brother to choose
1st off svc very very poor
went for brunch 12 noon sharp, seated quickly, but there on end speed of svc almost broke the sleep limits
We had 2 servers helping our party of 12, screwed up 3 orders had to re-do (frightful you never know what chef's mood is when they make mistakes)
drinks took forever then some
When food came, some dishes were already cold
This after requesting to bring them out as they are done so we can avoid this - totally ignored
They tried comping our kids with desserts (of course well received by my little devils), but this can not make up for poor svc, mediocre food (maybe burgers fries were ok) ineptitude of it's staff
AVOID THIS PLACE LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR BRUNCH!
What a mistake
Don't go here
Where do I begin? Mushy shrimp cocktail
Pre-cooked seared tuna that could have been a TV dinner
The waiter took 20 minutes to even acknowledge our presence even though the place wasn't very crowed
That should have been our warning
The table was draftly and cold
When we complained the Maitre d' wanted to debate with us rather than find a way to satisfy us
The last time I was here, I left feeling disappointed
I went back last night and once again felt disappointed
I think the prices have gone up dramatically over the years
The food is good, but definitely not worth the price

The food wasnt bad, and somewhat reasonably priced but it made us realize how important good (or at least sufficient) service is
I would not eat here again, our table had a substantial bill yet the waitress did not seem to care at all
You could go elsewhere for the same food and get better service
This pizza was awesome
Real Italian, thin crust, fresh ingredients
yum! And the prices were great
I've tried almost every italian rest in NY - and nothing can compare to No
28
The food and not to mention their pizza is unreal
I went there with some friends the other night and while we were there we met Salvatore, the pizzaiolo, who is not your typical pizzaman, he has so much character and personality, no wonder his pizza is incredible
I would reccomend this place to everyone
and while you are there try the Margharita DOC(Salvatore's speciality-not on menu) and their Zepolies!!!
The pizza at No
28 is made in a wood fired brick oven(hard to find in NYC), the crust is thin and crispy
My two favorite pizzas are the Daniele which is made with a tasty simple tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh arugula and prosciutto di parma on top sprinkled with a little parmigiano and amazing olive oil from their family's grove in Italy
My other favorite is called pizza patata featuring thinly sliced potatoes, fresh ricotta, fresh rosemary and walnuts
Everyone at the restaurant is friendly, there are always people screaming in Italian, you can watch Luigi the pizzaoilo make the pizza in front of the oven
This place is great for birthday's, a nice date or hanging with your friends
It's like going to an Italian home!
The best French food I ever had, (for an affordable budget)
Magnifique
Very highly recommended!! JUST THE BEST
What a wonderful place! One of the few French restaurants that is reasonably price and the perfect atmosphere for small groups and couples
Not only is the food delicious (the chocolate crepes, the roasted goat cheese and bacon appetizers and some of the other crepes they serve) but the French music is lovely as well
It's a very cozy place that is perfect for a relaxed evening out for tasty food
what a catch ! I thought it was impossible to find a good deal in soho but this restaurant made me change my mind ! the food is simply delicious (make sure to try the magnificent appetizers as well as the tasty main dishes but dont forget to leave a little bit of room for the crepes in dessert : you will be sure to have sweet dreams after that !), the service friendly and effective and the atmosphere cosy and romantic ! once you've tasted the food, you'll be sure to want to try every dish on the menu !
I never write restaurant reviews and i have enjoyed many Manhattan restaurants
Au Coin Du Feu is an adorable place with excellent food
The prices are extremely reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious
Definitely try the goat cheese, tomato and bacon appetizer, and the chocolate raspberry crepes for dessert
This restaurant is a great find - try it before it becomes well-known and crowded!
I went to Au Coin with five other people last Saturday night and it earned raves all around -- rare when you have six people and five different main dishes
The asparagus risotto was a standout, and I loved my chicken fricassee in cider sauce ($13 I think)
This is a place where you can taste the care and dedication in every bite
The music added atmosphere without drowning our conversation
Unlike many French bistros, Au Coin has a decent vegetarian selection, plus organic chicken
It's good to see that our vegetarian friends are not just an afterthought
This is not an expensive place, but it's about as high as you should need to go to get excellent food
Too many restaurants at this price level are just not delivering
This one does
Let's keep it in business!
We heard about this little French restaurant from friends who raved about it
Now we understand why! We could have walked right past it- the entrance is subtle- but we were so glad we didn't! The reasonably priced food was delicious, and the French chef, who serves the dishes himself, is extremely warm and friendly
Not only were the Prime New York Strip and Magret de Canard both deliciously prepared and perfectly seasoned, their presentation on the plate was extremely appetizing
The deserts of pear crepes with chocolate and red wine, as well as the caramelized apple with rum flambe, were very refined and the choice of cognac was impressive
I would strongly recommend this restaurant for its food, charming candlelight atmosphere and friendly service
I hope you'll support this recently arrived French entrepreneur!
The atmosphere is very nice, tipical French meal with very low prices Great quality food  A superb restaurant that Iwould recommend to everyone !!  Emilie Alex
What a great dining experience in that restaurant! Certainly the best diner I have had in a long time
- The French specialties are awesome: you have to try the Buckwheat Crepes and the Faux Filet Provencal, so tasty!  - The prices are the lowest in NYC for that quality of food
(delicious crepe for $7
)  - Great romantic atmosphere especialy at night with candles everywhere in the restaurant
To sum up, the best value in NYC!
This easy to miss little French restaurant on Lafayette at Spring is simply divine
The prix fixe was so reasonably priced at $28 and worth every penny spent
The food was presented with obvious care
French wine at $4 a glass is just too good to believe, and the complimentary cognac as a finale is a special touch! Do tell your friends about this lovely restaurant
Good things do, indeed, come in small packages
We WILL be back!
This is definetly a small place, you can easly miss it on Lafayette St
, the food is really great
And the price also :-) A crepe for 7$ or so it is fine
We (2) choose a dish of Fish and another one of Lamb it was really perfect, quite amazing
The Chef was nice and bring some cognac at the end of the meal
Amazingly cheap for the quality of food
Easy to miss the entrance but so difficult to forget the experience
Of course it is not the typical scene place that you can find in Soho, but the menu is great, food is really tasty (try the chevre chaud, and salted crepe, $7)
3 courses $28 menu is great, wine bottle from $18-22, $9 Cognac
A must in NYC !!!
This place will surprise you - it isn't very noticeable from outside, but once you go in, and try the appetizers (excellent chevre chaud), the crepes for dinner (around $7 only! can you believe it?) and the dessert crepes such as the emile -- banana and nutella -- you will immediately know that you have had the best french dinner in a very long time, all in a very quiet and peaceful setting
All in all, it is a very nice break from the noisy soho restaurants, for a night to enjoy your friends' company and some delicious food
The owner and the chef are doing a truly magnificent job and we hope to see more patrons there the next time around
it just opened, give it a try, you won't regret it
The complementary cognac at the end of dinner will leave you with a smile on your face :)
We loved their slogan because we just returned from South of France and definitely had the best cuisine in the world!! Coincidentally, we were told Au Coin du Feu has a location near Nice! It was no surprise that the food was authentic Provencal cuisine but we didn't expect the authentic French feel of the place probably evoked b/c of the French soulful music
Somehow the prices were below Manhattan's customary charges
We had French wine for $4 a glass
I think the bottle was $18
The sea bass had an amazing presentation and lots of flavor
The asparagus risotto was divine
The dessert crepes are to die for
My vegetarian friend had a lot of choices to pick from and thoroughly enjoyed everything
My husband likes everything everywhere already but raved about the Potato Leek soup
We love the place!!!
Great food, great service
If you're looking for nonstop attention, a 20 page wine list and a waiter who puts your napkin on your lap, this is not the place to go
You get high quality food (definitely top of the NYC pizzas), value for your money and a relaxing environment
Just what you want from a pizza place
This Totonno's restaurant is not like the Upper East Side version (which is great)
At the downtown Totonno's the food is solid, the pizza is good but expensive, and the salads are always good
However the service is atrocious
I had to go up to the bar to get a glass of water for myself the last time I was there
I had to ask several times for a check and that is after locating the waiter
The waiters do not pay any attention to the customers, instead sit at the bar and watch TV
I would consider ordering out but I will never eat there again
This is absolutely the best pizza in the city
Those fortunate to experience this pizza in the outer-boroughs are already well aware of this truth
I recommend delivery
This is what I've been waiting for
A cafe that serves true coffee

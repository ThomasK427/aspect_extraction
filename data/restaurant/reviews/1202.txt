I had heard much about Applewood and looked forward to a restauarant whose motto was to serve fresh natural local fare
In most instances they seem to do just that
However, the portions served [on normal sized plates mind you] was incredibly sparing to say the least!! I'm not asking nor do expect a heaping plate, but there should be a balance [ratio] of meat to accompanying side dishes
There was plenty of meat [venison] and cooked to perfection, but could they spare the vegetables beans!!
I have eaten at Applewood serveral times since they opened and have been impressed on each occasion
The food has always been cooked perfectly, and I have found the staff friendly and informative
Contrary to others' opinions, I find $6 for a glass of wine or $20 for a bottle more than reasonable
The wine list is well thought out and offers something for all budgets
Went to Applewood on 11/17 for dinner with some friends
Decor: The room was inviting, with a crackling fireplace, but the tables chairs look cheap, not the Vermont-esque appeal they are going for
Service: The hostess was very gracious and quite charming carrying her infant in a papoose, but the server was almost a mute, lacked any charisma, and was hard to find when needed
Food: The apps were very good - tried the mushrooms, ricotta dumplings and the lobster - all well executed although they didn't arrive at the table for 35 minutes after ordering
Of the entrees, the short ribs were very good, but the portion smallish; the venison-loin was delicious (as was it's accompanying vegetables and sauce) but it arrived well done when I requested medium; the yellowtail lacked any luster
Vino: The wine list is a little steep - stick to the the glasses
My husband and I went to Applewood for our anniversary
The service was gracious, yet comfortable, and we were truly 'taken care of' during our meal
The food showed great attention to detail, with nice touches such as homemade spreads for the bread and Indian-spiced mini-meringues with the bill
The fact that the ingredients are largely organic and locally-grown sealed the deal
Lovely!
Park Slope: You lucked out! This new joint, tucked on 11th St
right off 7th Ave
, brings wonderful (and fresh!) food, a great ambiance and an energetic staff into the neighborhood
Try Chef Shea's fish dishes -- always changing, always wonderful
(Our Snapper last night was out of this world!) Leave room for dessert -- a spiced hot chocolate is perfect for fall
An Upstate ambiance, a Park Slope vibe, Welcome to the Neighborhood
The Scene The restaurant's relaxed Brooklyn vibe softens its confident city look--knowledgeable servers make casual chit-chat with patrons at amply spaced and elegantly dressed tables
Local couples and families mingle leisurely at a dark wood bar, sipping well-poured cocktails like Manhattans and Old Fashioneds, before heading to the dining room, which overlooks the restaurant's namesake park
The Food Fresh, seasonal ingredients and the chef's attention to detail enhance the contemporary American menu
For starters, servers enthusiastically recommend the restaurant's most renowned dish--deeply flavorful marrow bones, served with candied garlic--or lightly spiced bluefish cakes, artfully plated with sweet corn relish and mellow celery root slaw
Main courses, deftly prepared, if not wildly innovative, include tender lamb shank, juicy pan-roasted Chatham cod, and buttery scallops with creamy risotto
Save room for the killer desserts, such as the decadent chocolate brioche pudding and seasonal favorites like an intensely sweet and tart strawberry-rhubarb crisp
Seriously people, they are to die for
My mother even thinks Stone Park's Biscuits are absolutely amazing, and that woman can cook! But don't get too blinded by their incredible brunch delights so you can leave room for dinner
While I don't like to brag, I have eaten more than my fair share of burgers in this town and honestly, the Stone Park Burger comes in at #1
For the longest time I thought that it was the spices they use that make their burger taste as good as it does, but then one day I actually asked and to my surprise Stone Park Cafe doesn't actually add spices to their meat, but rather it is just the high quality meat they use that creates a taste putting the Stone Park burger over the top
The brunch menu is really good
I tried a few things already and there are all good but the fried oysters and the buscuit and gravy are delicious plates! The service is also very attentive, they have little details that are difficult to find in a restaurant these days (they fold your napkin every time you leave the table
) Also if they are packed, they'll call you when they have a table for you
The waiting is less than 15 min
Stone Park Cafe is an exceptional find
The depth of the menu is surprising, with sandwiches, salads and a full range of entrees and appetizers
The food is very consistent and of a very high standard
The service is hurried, but that is about my only complaint
Finally, the value is outstanding
Fish of this quality is very hard to find at this price
I had the Striped Bass and it was sublime and my friend had a massive, juicy pork chop that sets the standard (the waitress said they brine them)
The wine list is pretty great, with some great values
After reading the review of the guy who hated everything (9
3 on a scale of 1 to wha???!!!) I have to think this guy has some kind of vendetta, for the place is not only undeserving of such scorn but one of the best restaurants in town
we stumbled upon stone park after unhappily leaving blue ribbon bakery
the host was kind enough to seat us right away
the server was friendly and knowledgable
the food was great
the short rib burger is a must have
and any restaurant that actually has a noticable management presence is a plus
The food quality is superb; the ambiance is pleasant; the prices are commensurate with the quality; but the service is subpar
For brunch, I HIGHLY recommend the biscuits and gravy -- they are unmatched
The other dishes were also delicious, but not as remakrable as the BG
The restaurant is decorated in a simple, casual, but refined style; one word: pleasant
The tables are close to one another, but that is expected in the five boroughs
Call for reservations
The walk-in seating service is awkward, as there are two entrances (neither of which appears to be the main entrance) and the hostess stand is oddly situated somewhere between both entrances
The wait service was nothing to complain about
The prices are a little high for the neighborhood, but not when you consider the quality of food served
Brunch was $11
95 or so without a mimosa/bloody mary
I am still ticked off about the $225 dollars I dropped at this arrogant, hack nightmare of a restaurant
Every dish was subpar with the exception of the short rib ap
From the lame salads to the dry, inedible chicken without any seasoning was hands down the worst food I have ever seen
My girlfriend spit out the dessert
This stuff wouldn't work in a West Virginia buffet never mind in NYC
Hey when you order Bone Marrow, you know what I like in the bones, marrow! There are at least 5 restaurants on their block better than this restaurant and Bruni gives them 2 stars? What exactly impressed him? The cheap setting, bad service, the hack food or the indifferent owner
This is not just a bad experience this is an embarrassment of a restaurant
Two stars? Say it a'int so Frank, say it a'int so
Let's see
A 50 minute wait after a promised 20 minute one, while looking at empty tables
A rude, unorganized maitre'd who did not keep a list and then got defensive and borderline aggressive when I pointed out he was seating people ahead of us
A waitress who got our order wrong, then seemed to forget that we existed
A salad that came with enough salt to choke a goat
While waiting for a table, tried to get a drink from a bartender who seemed more interested in arguing with his waiters
A terrible, awful dining experience
The only redeeming thing was the excellent bloody mary, but seeing as how it took 30 minutes for the bartender to get around to serving us, I really can't even recommend that
Stay away
Decided to try Stone Park last night after reading great reviews, went inside to where the maitre'd is
First some waiter stares at us and goes You know the front door is over there, you used the side entrance, we don't use that
Well the front door was closed and there was a table blocking it! The waiter then says, hold on, let me see how the wait is
Then he proceeds to go wait on tables rather than look for a table as he had promised
Finally, the maitre'd comes in, and looks for a table, says the wait would be 25 minutes, but at that point, we had decided to leave
And as we were leaving, You know we DO take reservations
Sorry, I'm sure the food is wonderful but when people act rudely, it's not my cup of tea
The experience was truly lovely
Good beers
Great food
The company was nice too, but is not included
I've had brunch here a few times and the food has always been excellent - french toast and hangtown fry are delicious
The seating policy is a bit confusing - often we waited 20-30 minutes while staring at several empty tables
Recently, I tried to take my family here for brunch and we were told they couldn't accommodate our party of 8, even though we saw a row of 8 empty seats
We were told that the kitchen was too small for a party that large, although they offered to seat us as 2 separate groups of 4 at the same time
I don't understand how dividing our group eased the burden on their kitchen that much, especially since there were several open tables and we would have ordered the same amount of food
Our party of 8 was welcomed across the street at Cocotte for an equally delicious brunch

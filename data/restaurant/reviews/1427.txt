Restaurant to be appreciated by people who live in the area (and have certain artistic and/or gourmet cuisine bend), or by adventurous gourmands willing to check out a new place that's had favorable NYT reviews, regardless of locale
Nabe is definitely desolate/remote
Got appetizer of crostini/toast with eggplant and type of cheese
Divine!! Then chicken pot pie
Crust was beautiful, flavor of pie awesome
Had unique underlying taste
not sure if lemon or what, but it worked! Only negative was meat wasn't perfect
Felt I had to pick through the meat a bit
For dessert got homemade chocolate pudding with fresh whipped cream
While taste was excellent, pudding had little balls in it; wondered if it was a chocolate tapioca, or if the balls meant pudding was a little overcooked/not mixed well enough
Either way still good
Service was fine for the type of place it was - quite laid-back
This place is wonderful
I've been a few times and the food is always delicious
The eggplant and butternut squash toasts melt in your mouth
The salads, esp
the winter vegetable salad, is amazing and my friends raved about their chicken pot pie and shortribs
But, what makes it so great is the atmosphere
Everyone seems warm and relaxed but the service is great
The place has real charm
If it wasn't so far out, I'd eat there all the time
But, it's easy if you're on the L line
Double thumbs up
NYT Reviewed restaurant, crosses frontier cabin with Vermont deer camp themes for a warm and inviting neighborhood spot
The food is great
Roasted eggplant toast with goat gouda, organic chicken pot pie, Lamb Stew, great salads and soups, well priced wine list
The place is funky and charming with a bohemian-art crowd
They also serve a fantastic weekend brunch!! www

Upon walking into scarlatto I knew I would be in for a great ride
The pre-theater menu offers a wonderful selection of food AND ALL FOR OUTRAGEOUSLY CHEAP PRICE!!! the Waitress was incredibly sweet
giving great service even though she was busy with so many other tables during the theater rush
she recommended the delicious seafood salad which is definetly worth a try
and the branzino was just outrageous
me and my wife were extremely satisfied with the reccomendations
our compliments to the chef!
This place is fabulous!!! We were in NY for a weekend in late February and while walking by, it caught our eye
We went there the next night and had some of the best Italian food ever!!! The panacotta with strawberries is to die for
Just so silky and smooth
Their service was very good and the ambience great
We were so happy to have found such a gem in midtown that we went back for lunch just before our flight back to SF
What a great value as well
Three course meal for lunch was $13, the prices for dinner were just as great!
You can't find food at this level in midtown for these prices
I was very pleasantly surprised
The food is good, solid gourmet italian fare and the service was excellent
The waiters were quite attentive and made good wine suggestions
My boyfriend and I went there on our anniversay
We went there to enjoy our dinner but we came out furious
First, they took over 10 minutes to bring over every drinks we ordered-water, coke, martini
Then, the food we ordered were nasty
We had chicken, which had no seasoning at all, thrown on top of salad
And fettuccini with wild mushrooms just tasted like linguini in mixture of ketchup and chilli
Mash potatoes were the best food they had
Then, they forget our glass of wine that we ordered, and charge us when we receive our check
And she accuse us of putting away the wine glass went when she herself has removed it to another table when we first ordered because only one of us ordered wine
This was the worst restaurant I've ever been to
Don't EVER go to this place
You'll regret it
I love the food here! The pre-theater pre-fix meal is the best
Had prosciutto, tomato, and mozarella to start
Veal as main course
and topped it off with tiramisu
the food here was so good
and all under $30
00
Which is even better
The only bad thing about this place is the service is kinda slow
waiter were unattentive
but the other staff were
which is as equally good
will definitely come back here
A bakery/enoteca, serving breakfast pastry, panini, cakes, cookies, coffee and wine
An eclectic mix, but I believe it works brilliantly
The espresso I had was fantastic, far better than any I have had recently in the Brooklyn/NY City area
The croissant, sublime, and much to my pleasure I discovered (from their warm, friendly staff) that they are from (one of my fav's) ceci cela
My sister ordered lunch
A beautiful panino of proscuitto, baby arugola and shaved parmesan on a devine ciabatta bread, with a georgeous glass of tempernillo on the side
We then indulged in a yummy coconut cupcake for dessert
The atmosphere was busseling, it was very busy, yet maintaining a warm, welcoming air
Seated at the copper bar we had a lovely time conversing amongst ourselves and some of the other satisfied regulars
Of which I may add we will become
This is the 4th restaurant that has moved into this building and like them all, this one is no better
I am sorry to say that the service was somewhat rude and the prices were ridiculous for the amount of food served
While I think the concept is well presented, the overall experience is not worth you money or your time
You are better off making your own sandwich then spending $6
00 for nothing
This place is with a great vibe
I love the ceviche and my pisco drink,is really authenthic peruvian cuisine
Hi went last night to kion with 4 friends, we are all designers and were recomended to check out the lighting design at kion
it was really cool, we had never seen anything like it, not in clubs and certanly not in restaurants
Aside the lights, i really recomend their ceviche tasting, you get 5 or 7 types of ceviches and all are great
we also tried the tuna tartar and the argentinean skirt steaks, all were good
my friend was vegetarian and was happy with the  vegetable stir fried
The service was good, but could be better, the bartenders were really cute and knew what they were doing, i recomend their fruit martinis
I recomend to anyone to try this place
Hi, I was at Kion on Saturday and was surprised that the place being so full, I was able to get my reserved table within 15 minutes
The environment was fantastic, my girlfriend and I were  drinking the best pisco cocktail while enjoying ceviche and sushi, which were great
The service was ok, not the best in the world, but everything else made it up for it

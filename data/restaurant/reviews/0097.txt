I was told that nothing was returned to the manager's office and rather than questioning the staff, they dismissed it off as pilfering by some other customer
It was a pretty dismal dining experience
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu
we went a while back i went with my gf i really liked the food here
the service was alright and the food was very well prepared and deff somewhere i would go back
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable
Stick to the gulab jamun
While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo
It's very spicy but not offensive
We will definitely go back
We eat here about once a year, ever hopeful that the food will rise to the level to the delightful ambiance that allows for easy table conversation, but alas, so far, it hasn't
Service is friendly and prompt
The grilled skewered lamb, nicely executed and presented, was juicy and tender, but the moderately portioned veggie dishes were disappointing: the chickpeas in spinach (chana saag) lacked character
and the stewed lentils (dal) swam in a thin sauce that apparently never was exposed to the chili peppers that are supposed to give it at least a bit of heat
(We frequent two very modest restaurants upstate in Rhinebeck and Red Hook, NY, that do a markedly better job of spicing these traditional dishes
Sapphire's cook might pay a visit
) Rice had to be ordered separately
We did not order wine
Desserts were unremarkable
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine
The staff has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in
Saturday, Nov
6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for
The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall
The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good, however
The beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table
i would recommend reservations on weekends though
skip dessert
It would be an excellent dining experience if you were a wealthy person
However, the service for the average customer is well below expections
We were not even asked once how the meal was or whether we needed anything
However the waiter was exceptionally friendly to the table next to us who had a large bill
On the other hand, the food was definitely tasty but the service did not make it worth it
This is a great restaurant
The food was exquisite and the staff was very cordial
The sommelier was top notch
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, romantic experience
It is a little pricey, but worth every dollar
This is a terrific restaurant
The food is excellent; they have a very nice wine list (and a sommelier who knows his stuff); and the staff are exceedingly pleasant
My wife and I have been to Sapphire six or seven times in the last year, and had a great dinner each time
It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood
My friend I went to have dinner enjoy some wine
To our surprise the restaurant had a sommelier
We ordered Riesling
We were not happy w/ the wine-a little fizzy lacking any alcohol bite
We explain to the sommelier why we're not happy w/ the wine
In his false hi-brow pronunciation, he says: There is nothing wrong with this wine
I will not take this off of your bill
You are 100% absolutely, positively wrong
I know my wine
We leave $10 on the table make to leave
At the door, the sommelier comes over with his manager argues with us about what he said
We refuse to participate in this surreal episode leave
If Sapphire is aiming to be an upscale Indian restaurant, it would serve its reputation to train it's waitstaff in that age old credo The customer is always right
A top spot for the Lincoln Center area, we appreciate this lovely restaurant every time we visit
Food is excellent and varied, and the service is generally very good as well
Value is much better than at many of the competing high-end Indian spots in town
I have eaten at many different Indian reastaurants and I must say that this one is by far my favorite
I origionally came here for my friends birthday and the service was amazing, the food was better and I had an even better time
Go here if you are looking for the best
If not, then hit up your local delivery but I must say, it is worth the money
The food is decent there
Waiters/ waitresses are okay
The portions aren't that big, but it's still tasty
I've come here a number of times for their dim sum
The dim sum is delicious, and they have a good amount of carts that come around often
The prices are EXCELLENT! I think it's worth coming here
The only thing is that it gets really crowded on Sundays in the afternoon; so, I recommend coming early for the dim sum
Also, parking can be a hassle, even with the valet
So, I suggest just park on the street if you get there at a busy time
for $3
50 you can't go wrong
competition must be fierce cuz used to get 3 selections over white rice, now you get 4
also, roast duck, roast pork (cha siu) or roast piglet over white rice is very good, the person was quite generous with portions
go after 8:30 not crowded they want to give you more
The SUM IT: Value is very good, food is very good, good selection
Better than ordering take out orders for twice the price you get variety!
dim sum svc is erratic, espec
if you sit in the rear rooms
greasy floors so watch your step

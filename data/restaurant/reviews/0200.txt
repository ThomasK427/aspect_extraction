We happened on Artisanal and couldn't have been happier with our find! If you're looking for a quiet, cozy place, this ain't it
If you're looking for a unique experience, try it
Holiday lunch in the city? This is the place to go! Large and loud, yes
If you want privacy and quiet, go elsewhere
This place was fun
Exceptional food and polite, informed service
Some servers seemed a little overwhelmed but, our table's conversation was never interupted and with a little patience the excellent food was right on time and perfectly prepared
The Tart Tartin was not quite up to the rest of the meal but, everything else, and I do mean everything, was a treat! You'd have to cross an ocean and drive into the contryside to have this experience anywhere else!
Having completed the NYC Eats Out exhibit at the NY Public Library I was blessed to find Artisanal which completed the awesome culinary theme! The staff welcomed me with open arms and directed me immediately to a wonderful table where I was able to survey the crowd yet not feel on display
My server was very busy but attentive and helped me through the wine and food menus with his own favorites as well as inquiring of mine
The Tuna Tartare was out of this world and a perfect light course! The soup was a Truffled Potato Leek that was redolent of the porcine favorite and comforting from first spoonful to last
THEN the highly recommended and even moreso appreciated Fondue with Truffles and Fontina! I was so glad there was noone else to share this jewel with
I added on the Dried Beef and it was HEAVEN! Highly recommended!
Being sat within twenty minutes of closing can be problematic, however I've always thought that this is where the best restaurants shine
In this case we were handed menus and stared at until we ordered, the specials being recited grudgingly only after we asked
No chance to sample any of the fromage as it was all packed up and stored away before we had a chance to order
The final insult came as we asked the waiter if we could have dessert and espresso at the bar
He said of course (he was only too happy to drop the check) and directed us across the room
When we got to the bar we were informed that it was closed
Too bad because the food was great, unfortunately the service was terrible
Good Guinness fondue pot
Great wine list (I recommend the Chandon Pinot Meunier!)
Service can be a little inattentive
I took my wife here for our anniverary recently and I must say that while the food was excellent the service was abysmal
In all my years of dining in Manhattan I have never before been made to feel that my presence was such an imposition on the staff
When I tried to get the assistance of a member of the floor staff, our waiter had apparently entered the witness protection program, he simply shrugged and wandered away
I decided later that this was because a sneer would take too much enrgy
I recently entertained some guests from out of town and had heard wonderful things about this restaurant
Their praise was definatly warranted
We had an excellent meal
The fondue was great, the meal itself was great, and we had several young children with us who enjoyed visiting the fromagerie
The staff was polite and helpful
This is an experience that I would not hesitate to repeat
And hopefully I will, quite soon!
Best Mac and Cheese in town, though not cheap
Skip reservations and sit at the bar
Great spot for a light meal of cheese, wine and salad
Mmmmm
Had a bad experience with the host, an extremely rude Frenchman
The food was overrated
Arrived around 1pm on a Saturday to have brunch with a party of five
We were seated immediately and the service was attentive albeit unfriendly
Hapily, the food was better than usual, probably because it was not crowded
We had the beignets for teh first time and they were wonderfully -- warm and hot --but too small
The various cheese sandwiches ordered were all very nice
The parmesan gnocchi was the star of the meal, though: perfectly sauced pillows of fluffy potato dough
We enjoyed out flight of 6 cheeses, but were rather disappointed that at least two of the given descriptions were quite off from what the cheeses were actually like
However, you can't beat the selection here
Oh, and we (still) love the modern bistro interior here, too
The only reason to go to this crowded New York spot is to eat the wonderful french inspired dishes and engorge yourself with it's unparallelled cheese selection
Everyother aspect of this eatery takes a sharp dive
Chef Brennan seems to have created a place that caters only to his wallet
I strongly suggest going for an early or late dinner-avoid peak hours if you wish to have a reasonably good dining experience
This is one place that really represents New York City and what dining is all about
Very classy, yet not stuffy
This is my 4th time having dinner at Artisinal and the sevice and food is consistant and gets better
The concept is unique but not complicated
The food is well prepared and well paced in seving it
Of course the cheese wins the prize
The Fondue of the day was the 100 cheese fondue! Can you imagine? I couldnt, until I tasted heaven!
Artisanal is a great date place for the well informed
A suitor invited me on a date and suggested Artisanal
Being impressed by his tasteful suggestion, I accepted his invitation
However this impression was vanquished when, in the cab, he began to make crude jokes about the restaurant's name
When we arrived, I was soothed by the ambient refuge and comforting staff
Fondue is an excellent dating instrument in that it encouraged us to bond with the ritual of feeding one another
After copious amounts of expertly recommended wine and cheese, the mood could not have been more perfect
My best advice is to not overdo it, as we did
Too much of a good thing dried out our mouths with a thirst that would rival that a twelfth round boxer
Needless to say, kissing was out of the question
The raw bar and cheese were wonderful
The entrees were so-so
A nice parisian feel
This place is great
This place is for friends, dates or any occasion
The fondue is great
If you don't go you are missing out on a great meal
Outstanding! Bravo! Nice atmosphere, great menu selections, fair pricing and one of the best wine lists I've ever seen
By the way, the food is to die for
The main reason to go to Artisinal is their excellent selection of cheese
I have tried about 20 varities, from Switzerland's nutty Hoch Ybrig to Spain's aggressive Cabreles and have never been disappointed
The service is hit and miss, and if you arrive at 5:00, they are pretty disorganised
They do have a cheese counter where you can sample and take home some of their amazing selection, so if you don't want to take a chance on the service, I recommend that
However, if you do eat in the restaurant, they have very tasty entrees and a large wine list with every choice offered by the glass!
I love cheese so much that I will probably try Artisanal again, but I was sorely disappointed on my first visit here
The fondue was good, but not worth the very expensive price tag
Maybe I should have just gotten cheese to go? The rest of the choices that we tried were mediocre at best - fingerling potatoes with cheese were nothing more than glorified potato skins
And the service - I can't imagine it being worse
Our waitress hardly spoken English - and not because she spoke French - and she spilled wine all over me and didn't try to make any amends
We were seated at a table so close to another that she had to lean over theirs to get to us
I'm used to spotty NY service, but this was just too much
I had a great birthday dinner here - we arrived early and were seated right away
We started with the white truffle fontina fondue, and the incredible 'cheese puffs'
mmm
but be careful not to get too stuffed! The main courses were tasty but not out of this world, and if you are a cheese lover then save the appetite, or just come here for a great cheese plate and wine pairings - we picked 6(out of 250) for our own cheese plate and had a blast! We did get annoyed when the fromagier (cheese man) blew us off and attended to more affluent-looking patrons, but it turned out we knew what we were picking anyway
Otherwise service was very prompt
Not the healthiest meal, verging on cheese-overload, but definitely a great treat for a special occasion
If you have 24 hours to live, consider spending it in the cheese cave at Artisanal
But why the weird attitude?On both visits, I had to beg to see the cheese list
The waiters seemed mystified

He misheard me and wrote an amount for 30%
When I told him, he left it
It is pricey and some servings might be small for a big eater, but the food is delicious, and the service is without pretention
I consider Olives to be a very good Mediterranean-influenced American restaurant
None of the dishes are authentically Italian, Turkish, or Greek, but rather a nice mix of flavors and traditions of those countries
That said, the food is delicious, beginning with the exceptional (complimentary) basket of assorted in-house breads served with olive tapenade
The vegetarian mezze platter is great for sharing, and the braised short ribs are phenomenal
The wine list is pricey, but also very high caliber
I adore the vanilla souffle for dessert
I also really enjoy the large, open space, roomy tables, and swanky decor, including many banquettes, and a few semi-private round booths toward the back
Lighting is dim enough to be romantic, but still lively
Service is rushed at times, however always curteous and knowledgeable
Try the bar, which also serves as a lounge for the W Hotel
good strong cocktails and a happening scene
Brunch on a slow Sunday
how hard is that? The food was average for brunch anywhere in NYC, and priced well above average
The atmosphere was strange, to say the least - techno music interspersed with the X-Files theme on a Sunday morning
However, the real low-point of our experience was the service
Fully staffed and relatively slow on a snowy morning, it took 20 minutes to bring out a $9 basket of (tiny) muffins, and 30 minutes to refill water and coffee - after multiple requests, and umpteen staff members walking by a table where everyone's drinks were empty for a while
To make matters even worse, after waiting another 20 minutes for the bill, it was wrong
Spend your $$ elsewhere
Entire meal was delicious
Started with the amazing fig and proscuitto flatbread, which was a meal in itself
(Next time, I will start with one of the salads and order the flatbread as my entree
) Tampanades were great
Garlic crusted roast chicken was moist and very flavorful
My friend had the scallops and she loved them
We were both too full for dessert (which rarely happens)
Service was attentive but unobtrusive
We were not rushed at all
Only drawback: we were seated directly behind the partition separating the bar area from the main dining room and the bar crowd noise was very jarring, at times
My husband and I stayed at the W Union Square recently, and we tried out Olives one night
The food was so good that, despite our wanting to explore other area restaurants, we had to go back!  They had a special ribeye that was just the best thing I've ever had
I craved more all week long, but when we went back to Olives, they had run out of ribeye
Instead, the chef made me a special creation off the menu, and wow
Again, an amazing meal
I have to say it was an expensive meal, but we'll surely be back on special occasions
What an enjoyable evening! From the wine to the dessert, everything was oustanding! The oysters were incredible, the rack of lamb was a little boring, but the best was without a doubt the banana bread! I know what you're thinking, but you would be amazed with how they spiced this dessert up! A little pricey, but worth it for a special night out
Well done!
My husband and I had dinner here this past week on Tuesday night and it was delicious
We started with cocktails, sangria and the pomegrante sour, both a result of their on-site mixologist, both stellar
We had their special fig appetizer and the asparagus tart - both were great
The food is definitely on the rich side so it's great for a real treat
For main courses we tried the butternut squash pasta dish and the scallops
Both were prepared exquisitely
The food is interesting and inventive
Our server, Matt, was amazing; he had suggestions, didn't hover over us, and always made sure we had full drinks
He even gave us a complimentary sample of pudding - since it was our first visit
We ordered the warm cookies and biscotti to go since we so stuffed
What a great evening!!
I had been wary of going to Olives for a long time because of mixed reviews I'd seen here
but I'm glad I did go eventually
The Restaurant Week lunch menu was superb and portions were more than generous
The bread basket alone was worth the price of admission
The steak was unbelievably juicy and tender
The carrot cake was a bit overwhelming (way too sweet), but the chocolate raspberry fudge was perfect
Service was attentive, respectful and competent
Well done, Mr
English
Very good, I was impressed! Ambience was excellent, and the food was good
I was a little disappointed in my entree but overall the food was very remarkable
Dessert was astonishing! Give it a shot
I enjoyed myself!
I've been there for drinks before and it's usually a mob scene, but had a business lunch there last week and really liked it
They had a restaurant week menu (but restaurant week was last month?) for $21 which included 3 courses
These are not small portions of crappy product they set aside for restaurant week
The quality was fantastic
The only person in my group who didn't like her food didn't like garlic
I thought it was great and I'll go back
Although I have not sat down in the actual restaurant, I have hung out and drank cocktails in the lobby at Olives in the W of Union Square, and can tell you that it is always a crowd pleaser
The wine is pretty good, and there is no bargain on the prices, but the fun here is in the excellent and European environment that has top-notch music and luxurious surroundings
I definitely swing by on Sundays and Mondays when there is enough space for friends to secure a couch to chill and enjoy the setting
Maybe I went in expecting too much, but I was dissapointed
The service was excellent, but the food was just OK
I felt the chef was using truffles too much just to cover up mediocre food
The desserts weren't anything special either
I don't even remember them they were so plain
i went there friday night with my boyfriend
it was very crowded, but hostess was very friendly and found a good table for us
service was great
out waitress was helpful, pleasant and never rushed us
food there was excellent
appertizers, main course, and dessert were all A+
oh, and they have good wine if you like to drink
the front part of the restaurant is bar/luonge area, so you can stop by just for drinks
My girlfriend and had a great experience here last night for dinner
We were in the mood for Mediterranean food, and we have wanted to try Olives for awhile
Our waitress was super attentive, and that always makes the experience more pleasurable
I had one heck of a dirty martini (I figured it was Olives, so I had to it)
My duck was awesome

her Vegetarian Mezze was tasty
Best part of the meal however, was probably the free bread that comes with the olive tapenade
Not cheap, but worth it every once in a while
The sommalier deserves a metal
He made our night so special!!! He helped us choose a great wine and attended to us all throughout the night
While the tables are way too close together, over all the room and ambiance is great
And they really know how you execute an elegant , thoughtful meal
Strong service
Memorable in every way,except maybe the food

When I called to point out the mistake, the guy on the phone refuses to refund my credit card
To to it off, the chicken was dried out, the fries were soggy and the rice one gelatinous clump
Will never order from there again
Pio Pio is one of the best values in the city
With huge, flavorful portions of juicy Peruvian chicken with an incredibly addictive secret-recipe green sauce, heaping platters of steaming, crispy fried seafood with a memorable cilantro-lime salsa, and sweet, tender tostones, Pio Pio offers great food in a very festive space
The reviews that mention poor decor are older -- the restaurant has been redone and now features brightly-colored paintings, artful piles of fresh fruit, a cool window-bar wine rack and gorgeous fresh florals
Sure, it's tiny and the service could be more attentive, but for a fantastic meal in a fun setting for under $12 a person, how could anyone complain? Skip the salchipapas and rice and beans -- stick with the avocado salad, jalea and lots of chicken
This unseeming little restaurant tucked away in the Upper East Side surprisingly pleases
With its succulent, tender chicken, it's crispy lime laced seafood jalea and its piquant green sauce, Pio Pio leaves its customers more than satisfied in taste without suffering from sticker shock
However, the service was unattentive and lethargic
The menu like the facade of the restaurant is deceptively understated but large portions and limited physical space makes this place best suited for parties of four to take advantage of the variety of tastes on order
Every time a friend of mine comes into town, we need to order the chicken - its one of her favorite memories of NYC! The chicken is good, the salad with avacado great - skip the fries and go for the rice and beans and plantains
At PIO PIO, you will find the best peruvian chicken ever
The staff is very polite and courteous
The price on the meals are perfect, just to imaging eating a JALEA which anyone who knows what this is will calucalte atleast $20 will be surprised to see it for $12-14
Its worth it
Even though they only emphasizes on peruvian rotisserie chicken its worth eating there
Pio Pio is an excellent value, serving copious amounts of hearty chicken and delicious plantians
The rice and beans are cooked perfectly and the service is quick and polite
While, not gourmet it is an excellent value and very high quality food in a relaxed (not shabby, just plain) environment
They deliver, too
This place is great! I don't understand the poor reviews
The plantains and chicken are wonderful
If you are looking for original ceviches and a smorgasbord of peruvian cuisine then you have come to the wrong place
Pio fails to deliver what it tries to convey; chicken and fries are as basic as mashed potato at boston market
This peruvian restaurant does not take the leap into full flavor peruvian cuisine instead, it tries to reach for the anglo-american market offering dishes such as salchipapa (french fries and franks), roasted peruvian chicken,etc
The site is also very small, leaving limited seating to those around
The potential is there unfortunately the menu isn't
We ate at Plant Hollywood following our late arrival into NYC
It was a couple of blocks from our hotel
We were very disappointed in our meal
We were seated promptly and service was OK, but our waiter seemd to be going through the motions though he stayed ontop of our needs
My meal was cold, so you knew it had been 'nuked' prior to serving
My wife said her meal was OK while our son did not finish his chicken pieces
Over 2 years ago when my daughter and I had visited this restaurant, it was very good even for the lateness of the evening
Unfortunately, this was far from the same experience
We had a New York pass that gave us each $10 off the food
We ended up paying like less then a McDonalds meal in New york for more food then we could eat, which was good quality and yummy! The restarant is something to see
Probably the best Planet Hollywood
You gotta get up at some point and look around at the movie memorabilia! The service was outstanding, super friendly and courteous and with the discount we payed such a steal of a price! If you are going to new york, get the pass and go here to eat!
You don't go to Planet Hollywood or these theme restaurants like Mars 2112, they're not going to be focused as intently on the food
You go to these places for the decor, the eye candy, the surroundings
The food is dressed up diner food at worst and tries to be classy at best
Stick to the desserts and drinks and you'll be ok  The staff are prompt and friendly, it's a kid friendly place so feel free to take the little ones
Kids (ages 9 and 14) loved the place
We had a great table near the window overlooking Times Square
Wait staff was friendly and efficient
Food was very good (not what I would have expected from a chain restaurant)
Very pleasant surprise!
After watching a great off-broadway play,(Prince and the Pauper),this place hit the spot
I went with my Aunt and we had an amazing time
Mother / Daughter night in the city included dinner here - 15 of us!
Everyone was very happy with the food, service, prices, and the memoabilia decor
Definitely a hit!
PH was the closest restaurant to our hotel, so we ended up eating dinner there our first night in NYC
I was pleasantly surprised by food (and the prices)
Lots of choices on the menu, and interesting memorabelia to examine
The chocolate shake was very good
One drawback was the noise from the TV monitors
I had a real nice time at Planet Hollywood
I ordered a dessert and it was one of the most delicious I've ever tasted! My drink was great as well
They got everyone's attn in the restaurant and everybody sang Happy B-Day to my friend
it was really fun
The waitreses are young and energetic and did a great job
I would definately go back
Sadly this is no longer an unknown secret, but it is still the best sushi on the UES
This place is everything that more famous places in the neighborhood are reputed to be, but it is much less expensive and pretentious
Great, creative sushi that, even for sushi novices, is noticeably better than what you get elsewhere
Poke has moved to a bigger and better place
This makes the entire experience much more enjoyable
Before the move the biggest con in my opinion was the size, it was just to small for the number of people who wanted to enjoy the wonderful sushi
343 E 85th Street (Bet
1st 2nd) It's just down the street!
The rolls didnt look as impressive as I expected but they tasted great
In comparison to Tenzan (UWS) Poke's rolls seem downright skimpy
but they were really well balanced
So if you like a lot of fish with your rice go someplace else
if mouthfulls of raw fish isnt your thing
got to poke
Another plus is their variety of special rolls
I had the gyoza as an appetizer and it was just average
Bottom line is: I will go to Poke again because it was really fresh fish
I just wished that they used a bit more of it
You can beat the crowd if you go early
I thought the decor was kind of cute
but thats just me
Tried Poke for the first time last Friday evening and was GREATLY disappointed
The actual pieces of sashimi were the smallest I have ever been served, and the rolls were sub-par to say the least
Now I understand it's a small place and it's BYOB so they need to turn tables over quicker than most places
but the waitress was literally at our table every 5 minutes pushing us to order
Stick with Upper E staples like Sushi Hana, MUCH better for your $$$
It's cash only, so you know what that means :)
It's not cheap, but it's not expensive, either
The upside is that the fish is fresh and you can BYOB
any kind of B, including wine, sake, hard liquor-- you name it, they'll open it
The downside is the wait, the decor, and the prices aren't as cheap as you would expect
A sushi platter ranges from $17 (for 7 peices) to $24 (for 10 peices plus a roll)
The rolls are anywher7e between $7-12, and their fish is about $3-4
50 per peice
The uni and toro is the usual $7-8 per peice

Great place to watch games and bring friends visiting from out of town
My guy friends and I went last night to just hang out and drink a few beers, and we hung out at the very crowded bar
The gorgeous blonde bartender, who's name I wish I knew, made us feel like we were her only customers and cracked jokes with us all night
The food was great, the music was good, all in all a solid time
I would go back any saturday!
I went to Brother Jimmy's on Second Ave
with a group of girlfriends from home
We're from North Carolina and we had the best time! Our server was southern and downhome nice
The ribs had a lot of flavor, I would recommend getting the combo ribs and trying them all
Plan on a lot of eating and then lots drinking at the bar afterwards
The bartenders are cute and fun to talk to- the music is also good an even mix of country and rock and some hip hop thrown in there
We were having the most fun singing along, just a fun fun night , we can't wait to go back
Ya'll should definitey check out Brother Jimmys esp
you southerns who need a quick fix of home
The food seems to have gone south for eternity
Lots of competition and I don't think they can keep up
The place is still great to watch a game, and be a frat boy again, but so are so many others! The waitresses are nice, but seem to have been there too long, and are not interested unless you are their regular and tipping big and filling their ego
They know who they want to serve and who they don't
Good luck if you choose to go, it can be hit or miss, more often miss
BBQ has gotten big in the city and they can't compete, oh, and I think they raised their prices, again!
As a native of North Carolina, I had a heck of a time findin' REAL bbq
Brother Jimmy's pulled pork bbq is the most authentic in the city
Now I don't have to travel all the way back to Carolina to get my pig fix
I recently had a large party here and I couldn't believe how accomodating everyone was! The food was to die for especially the sliced brisket and dry rub ribs!! Everyone was extremely friendly and went out of there way to make sure my friends and co-workers were satisfied
one more thing,you have to get the mac cheese! If you're in the mood for some southern hospitality, then this is the place!!!!!!!! Great place to hang with your friends
This place is a great place to meet up with friends
Good food and strong drinks! Always a good time!
I have never been to fushioned restraurants too much but this korean japanese fushioned combination was the best I have ever had
Their house roll blew me off my chair and mmm
kalbi
wow!! For all those skeptical sushi eaters
definitely try their house roll they surely have many varieties to choose from
I had a hard time choosing since they all sounded delicious
Word of advice
ask about the sake list
I ended up trying different types of sake the whole time I was there
I've been going to this place called 'Sandobe' long before the sushi became so trendy in the city
The price is so reasonable and the unique taste of this Sandobe special rolls have hooked me for years! Now they moved to the bigger place and added various exotic selection of fusionized Asian dishes and I became to love this place even more now!!!
I dont go often here but I should considering the food they serve is tasty and cheap
I especially love the korean dish's they add into there menu consider its 2 for 1 its hard not to resist with asian cuisine being so expensive in all in New York
The sushi is better than im used to in soho
The service is good and attentive since the place isnt packed like a can of sardines
Overall Its a great place to eat at if not once then regularly
I go by here often since its a pretty close walk from home but even if it wasnt I would make the trip because they make this absolutly lovely Ice cream tempura along with these tasty house rolls called Sandobe rolls they make which just shouts goodness
I also would like to reccomend there great selection of korean entrees and sidedishes which accent there resturant quite nicely
I had a great time with my friends and even got to know the staff a little
Definetly reccomended overall
I was always not very fond of sushi but ever since I started eating at sandobe (first location) Ive loved sushi ever since its touched my mouth
It takes an awful lot to get the idea of eating uncooked fish while enjoying it in your head
There new location is much nicer than there old location which actually had to make shift rooms and squeeze the staff in tight corners
Whats changed is the nice new decor while still keeping the sushi the way Ive always loved it
Staff does change frequently but its the suhi i go there for not the company
Most sushi places i've been to in the village has been too small, crowded with unfriendly staff
When my friend introduced me to sandobe I felt like I was in a sushi diner where I was able to sit and talk with my friends without having to talk loud
I sat there for what felt like hours just catching up
The house rolls were delicious and so pretty
I especially enjoyed their sandobe roll and the joanne roll
Yum~!
Since the move to First Ave
, Sandobe has continued to go downhill
They used to have high quality and excellent value, but NO LONGER
As time goes by the quality, value, and service all get worse
The new decor can't make up for the decline, and the revolving-door staff just doesn't cut it
What once was an easy-going, quirky, GREAT restaurant has become ordinary and, simply, not worth it
Save your money
Absolutely delicious
and if you eat in, you can enjoy their gorgeous presentation of food
I really enjoy this restaurant every time I go
They have the best rolls i've ever had
The service has always been friendly and reasonably prompt
They also have many kinds of sakes
And the price is very reasonable
A great place to visit!!
I ordered salmon tuna sushi with a sandobe roll
the roll was great as usual but the salmon was old the tuna did not look good at all
Been comming here for the past 2 years but i dont know if the management has changed or the manager has changed
The fish is definitely not the same as it used to be
I had been to Sandobe years ago and really liked it
The sushi is still easy on the wallet, but last night was unbelievably bad at Sandobe
Rice was mushy, pre-formed, stale, and tasted like salt water and soap
Fish was ok in terms of portions, but horrible
Snapper was tough; yellowtail was very bland
King crab was flavorless, even with the lime and scallion garnish
Spicy tuna roll was disgusting
dry tuna, overwhelming sesame (and I love sesame), and bland
The entire roll was covered in roe (really too much)
The only decent parts of the meal were the sake, the sushi bar salad (free with the meal), and the unagi
The service was poor
We were so disappointed that we wanted our money back
I haven't had sushi this bad EVER
My friend that lives in the area loves Sandobe
After so much hype, I had to try the place
I wouldn't say that prices are high because I felt that prices were reasonable
Service was great, our waiter was excellent
The decor was cool with colorful illuminated squares in the middle of each table
The food and sushi is nothing spectacular but still good
Overall, I think this is a great place for locals but, if I'm traveling crosstown I need more than just a good meal
The presentation of their nigiri sushi pieces is very unique
They give you big slabs of fish with small pieces of rice
Most of the pieces were very fresh

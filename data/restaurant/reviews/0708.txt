had takeout
shephards pie was delicious!!! so was the guac
great idea for rosebowl party! will do it again for the superbowl
OK had reservation and still waited thirty minutes for a table
What's the point of a reservation if you cannot keep the reservation? Food was salty and horrible, had the worst date ever here
Go to the fun places in the West Village not the stuffy places like this place
First of all BEST server I have ever had in my life
(kevin) pronounced KA-VAN
Best value for what you get i have ever seen in the city
My friend and I ordered like 4 Apps in the main dining area w/drinks, we were stuffed with great food enjoyed the drinks
I had the rasberry mojitos, she had the champagne sangria
You must try the grilled corn on the cob with shredded chesse, amazing 4
00! It was my first time this past Sunday, i am going back thursday
Do not miss this well kept secret
Was with a group of 6, nice seating, overall friendly service, especially considering we were late
Lobster quesadillas, braised pork platter, enchilladas were all excellent
the only comment on food might be the guacamole app could have been more plentiful, but at least it was very good
maybe i was just really hungry
Overall a very comfy environment, spectacular Sangria (red anyways), killer margharitas and nicely prepared entrees
Would defintely recommend and return!
Green Chile Corn Chowder w/chicken: hearty, subtle hint of chile, tomatoes add a little sweetness, chicken and potatoes add flavor and nutrition
Cilantro adds flavor
Chile Crusted Seared Ahi Tuna: chile adds a terrific smokiness, not heat, the tomato consomme and olive/caper relish are excellent accessories to moist, high quality tuna
Blue Crab Quesadilla: tortilla cooked perfectly, not undercooked, but not hard
Crab is easy to taste, guacamole with it has a hint of chile which adds to it
Fresh Fruit Margarita of the day: Blood Orange has just the right amount of sweetness and tequila/tartness to be refreshing and interesting
Overall quality: excellent, can't wait to go back
We had wanted to try Agave for a long time and we were not disappointed
We went on a Monday so it was not crowded
Our waitress was extremely helpful
It is hard enough trying to choose a margarita, then you have to choose your meal
We had the Gazpacho, it was nice with a little kick
My wife had the Squash Blossom Tacos and she was happy with her choice, I had the Beef Machaca Enchiladas and they were very flavorful
We were too full to try dessert
We can not wait to go back
Each time I've eaten at Agave, I've been impressed
The brunch is fantastic (and great for groups), the atmostphere welcoming and bright, and last weekend, my Angus burger, calamari margarita were DELICIOUS
I overheard many other diners there saying the same about their dishes
I find the drinks a little pricey, but worth it
The service to this place was HORRIBLE! I would totally NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone!!! DON'T GO! We had reservations for a big group but were unable to sit until everyone showed
then when we all showed (only 15 minutes later) they told us they GAVE AWAY our table! The hostess was totally not accomadating, and even though there were empty tables they still didn't seat us! Plus while waiting near the bar, we NEVER got served drinks and the bartender refused to serve us as we were at a side table which only had waitress service
which never came
The menu was very limited and PRICEY! On top of that with all the bad service- they put an automatic 20% gratuity charge on our bill! DON'T GO!
went there with a bunch of friends two night ago and had a real good time
margaritas were great (a large selection of tequilas but waiter could have been more informed on them), food was great, atmosphere was great
good job
I was highly disappointed with my food at Agave
The food did not seem fresh and was lacking in taste
Everything was bland
The guacamole tasted like it was store bought
The cactus in my quesadilla tasted canned
The bill came to almost $150 for two people which included a large pitcher of sangria which was the only good part of the meal
Overall, Agave is definitely not worth the trip or the money
I went to this restaurant with a few friends and the meal was just average
The service was a bit scattered, and the food was okay, but nothing mind blowing
For the money, I'd probably go somewhere else
There was also a big group that was very noisy, so that was a bit disruptive too
I went into Agave last night (Sunday) with 2 girlfriends and we were all extremely pleasantly surprised
From the outside it looks like yet another trendy village restaurant, but once inside it was actually really cozy and comfortable
with just enough spice
The drinks are dangerously good (although a bit over priced) and the service was friendly but not too pushy
Speaking of staff, they're all beautiful, so go for the good food and eye-candy service (especially the guy with the buzz-cut who I think was the manager)
Anyway, I'm definitely going back

Order the chili con queso and be fat but very happy
went back to agave for a second look for cinco de mayo, lot of energy, very busy
not disapponted
had the blue margarita which went down way toooooo easy with some chili and chilled
real good time
Margaritas and atmosphere were Generic and below average
Staff was very rude especially the owner, he has obviously never herd of hospitality or customer service
We felt so aggravated and uncomfortable that we had to leave and go somewhere else
I would definitely recommend staying far away from this place it is not worth ruining your night
Went to Agave on cinco de mayo
place was crowded of course
The servers were frustrated with the crowd, which is understandable but they were being rude
We were there for a birthday party with about 15 people
The owner was extremely RUDE
Was confrontational and tried to bully some of us
Not a good way to treat people buddy
I would never go back and would never recommend Agave to any of my friends
Agave provided one of the best dining experiences that I have ever had in the city
The setting is beautiful and the food is amazing
The menu is accommodating for those who like to be adventurous as well as for those who are inclined to stick to more traditional southwestern food
In addition, I recommend taste-testing the various margaritas
I never realized how much I liked southwestern cuisine until I ate at Agave
The Lobster Taco was very unique
I am glad that I tried something new
Also, I highly recommend the Blue Tarantula Margarita
I am definitely going to bring the rest of my friends back to enjoy the great food, wonderful ambiance, and pleasant service
This is such a great place
We were there last Thursday and the whole place was alive with activity, great food smells and just the feel of a happening place
The waitstaff was very cool and calm although the restaurant was nearly full
Great food, really good drinks
What can I say? Everything we had heard was true
Like most of New York City's restaurants (I find myself saying that alot), this place is way over-rated
My date and I went on a Thursday night
In short, it was way too loud (they sat us next to a stereo speaker!!!), too crowded, the drinks were too small and WAY OVERPRICED (a bad mojito in a what was about an 8 oz glass was 10 dollars), and the service was horrible (out waitress disappeared for most of the evening)
The food was actually good, if over-priced

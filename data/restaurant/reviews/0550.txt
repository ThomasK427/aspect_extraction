they recently stopped serving the molases baked beans that were awesome
what a bummer
The Scene The upholstery and Formica make it look a bit like a suburban, strip-mall restaurant, but the coal-fired brick-oven pies please the crowds regardless
Simple "marinara" is wrought with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and a yeasty crust
Elaborate toppings are available as well, like bitter broccoli, rabe-sweet sausage and garlicky shrimp
Non-pizza options include seafood pastas baked in the brick oven under a cover of pizza dough, and dishes like chicken marsala and parmigiana
Definitely get 'extra cheese'
otherwise you won't get any
and the crust was pretty soggy, probably from the vegetables
But otherwise, pretty good
Definitely a nice change from Ray's and others like it
Thinnest crust in town -- you can literally see through it as you sit there and watch them throw the dough
Now known as Bella Sera, at last the service here (both in-house and delivery) is approaching the quality of the food -- though I'm hard-pressed to think how anything could be better than a large mushroom-garlic-and-anchovy pie from this place
It'll completely ruin you for those Ray's greasebombs, sorry to say, but life's too short to eat inferior pizza
Eat here instead!
One of the few pizzerias in town, which still has a coal burning brick oven
Best pizza you can get outside of John's on Bleeker
Ask for extra cheese
the cheese is so fresh, there is not enough unless you get extra
The pizza is the best on the upper east side
One pie feeds two people, but you will eat the whole thing
The slices are thin, they use real mozzarella, but very sparsely (read:order extra cheese) but the sauce and the crust are great
The service is decent, but for a pizza place it is way above average
The food is actually pretty good here
and offers quite a lot of choices
However, the decor is below average (dark and old) and is usually pretty empty during lunch hours
Also, based on my own observation (lunched here a few times), the average age of people dine here is 45
Never have we felt more welcome in a NYC restaurant before
The owner Don greeted us at the door with a warm smile, and seated us for dinner upstairs
Not only was the Grilled Red Snapper to die for, but we also had Long Island Duck, Steak Au Poivre, and Chicken Madeira
This place has something for everyone
Every dish more tasty than the next
OH, save room for the desserts
I strongly recomend
Discover unwind in the warm, friendly atmospher that abounds in this elegant restaurant where you can relax and enjoy the freshest seafood in NYC
The crabcakes are outragesous and Daily Specials which includes a variety of pasta have been added to the already extensve menu
One can enjoy drinks and food and meet new and old friends in the cozy bar that has french doors which opens out during summers months (weather permitting)
From the moment you enter you know you're in for the best dining adventure ever
The service is outstanding, excellent menu, and great wines
Steve really puts you in the mood to enjoy your meal and his staff, and the setting allows you to relax and dine

This place is a true gem, combining superb fish with great service
Try the wonderful Crab Cakes and Halibut Greek , Plaki ,style for a real treat
Steve, the owner, transplanted his very popular Long Island restaurant to mid town a few years back, bringing a relaxed atmosphere , wonderful dishes and a very impressive Greek wine selection
Steve will happily recommend a tasty red wine to accompany your fish dish, expanding your horizons and transporting you to the Agean Sea
Great fish but if your not into seafood go elsewhere
also not a place for those that don't love garlic!
The Scene Dim lighting, rustic wood tables and endearing details, like handprinted menus held together with wooden spoons, invite intimacy at this cozy Sardinian wine bar
Small groups of friends and romantic couples find comfort in the restaurant's down-to-earth air and bustling pace
The Food It's heaven for bread, cheese and cured-meat lovers
Assorted platters offer a chance to nibble on antipasti and salami; add a fresh salad of arugula, Parmesan and shaved fennel to contrast
Don't miss crostoni topped with chicken liver pt
The tiramisu just might restore your faith in this ubiquitous dessert
I go every week to Doc and the frendly staff pairs food with specific wine to take the guesswork out of choosing the right wine with your meal
The true stars are the melts-in-your-mouth everyday specials, i tested the pasta fregola, the chicken liver pate',a traditional dish from sardinia (they told me is a sheppard's dish) with the crispy bread, tomatoes sauce, pecorino cheese and egg
is very tasty!!!! I recomend doc to everyone, is a rare pearl in new york
and the tiramisu'
??? amazing!!!!!!!! Well done Doc

continues to offer great service and a neighborhood feel
The food and wine are still among the best in the city as well, with freshness and quality at the forefront
The total package
I'm over the moon for this restaurant ! It's worth take the subway from manhattan I've loved their vibrant food for years
and now, I can sit in the sun and relish their delightfully delicious talliere
Wow !!! The sun and the moon

i've been here 3 times
the first two times were absolutely perfect
the 3rd however, the waiter forgot to put in our order for food and we ended up waiting an hour for them (b/c they were really busy)
they did comp us a dessert and glass of dessert wine however
i will go back b/c i love the atmosphere and food so much
perhaps try going on an off night when it is not so packed
Sitting on the corner of Nth 7th and Whythe, D

C Wine Bar is an exceptionally cozy little spot
The array of vino is impressive and they offer some delectable dishes
It's a tad pricy though; a decent bottle of wine and a platter of cheese and meats set us back $60 incl tip
the decor and food are actually very good
but now i have learned the importance of SERVICE! i believe our server was also the proprietor
he was the worst server ever!! he clearly makes you feel unwelcomed and that you are bothering him by being there
he forgot one entree, forgot the 2nd bottle of wine, forgot to bring bread, we had to go to the kitchen on our own for the salt, vingar and oil
charged us $40 to bring in a cupcake for our friend's birthday, but did not advise this outrageous price
DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY HERE
spend your money at another place that actually appreciates your business
perfect date spot
we were able to seat promptly
deeply enjoyed the charm of a waiter like only in Italy you can find, ready to give suggestions about wine and food  Service is casual and friendly and yet professional, the waiters are always ready to give helpful suggestions
we had the selection of special cheeses along with a carpaccio and e nice salad with figs all topped with a bargain, super nice, 50$ bottle of fine Montepuciano gently suggest by the waiter
I paid a 100 for the both of us dessert included and the I had probably on of the most smooth and intense dates of my life
The wine, the food, the atmosphere, the service
absolutely perfect
They have an amazing selection of wines by the glass and very friendly and helpful waiters/waitresses that can help guide you through the list
Also their selections of pairings of wines and cheeses are right on the mark
This restaurant is a must try for a beautiful and romantic evening
I can't keep my paws off these tiramisus! Local legend has it the owner stole the recipe from his grammy while she had her back turned, stirring up a pot of fregola back home in Sardegna
Williamsburg is lucky to have a little nook like this one holding down the fort with heaps of cheeses and meats, crispy flatbreads and damn good italian wines by the bucket, all perfectly priced and paired with just the best atmosphere

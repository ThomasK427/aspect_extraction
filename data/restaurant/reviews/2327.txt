Brunelli's does not disappoint
Great food at very reasonable prices, friendly service, and one of the very few places where you can watch Italian soccer via satellite in midtown
I have never had a bad pizza at Vinci's
They have a great crust, with a smooth and very tomato pizza sauce, basil and cracked pepper lift up through it's sweetness
I loved the Vinci's special, the Marinara, and the eggplant pizza
Great Italian food
I rarely eat sauce on pasta, but this is the sauce
We come to New York from Ohio twice a year and we always make sure we make it to Vinci's for dinner
I'm currently working on becoming a sushi connoisseur in NYC and have dined at many sushi restaurants in the past few months
I had an excellent experience at Totoya last night and highly recommend everyone to try it
I was seated immediately, the staff was extremely friendly, the sushi was fresh with innovative specialty rolls, the presentation of my sushi platter was exquisite and ornate, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting
Great prices to boot
Totoya is a must try
I'd heard Totoya was good but it was even better than I expected! The fish was fresh, innovative, and reasonably priced
The fluke appetizer with ponzu sauce was fantastic
Go - you won't regret it!
Being a sushi lover, I have visited quite a few Japanese restaurants here in NYC and this one is a great place to take a date! The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff does not rush you
The fish is very fresh and the prices are very competitive with several other large Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood
I wish they had more of a selection of traditional Japanese dishes other than the basics offered
After getting shut out of Sushi Sekki for not having a reservation, my girlfriend and I (obviously jonesing for sushi) went across the street to Totoya
Suprisingly fresh sushi is the best way to describe this place
They got some great special rolls (Spicy Dragon Roll in particular)
After the meal I was kinda of glad I got shut out of the other restaurant
Wonderful sushi! Definitely some of the largest portions I have had in the city so far
Good service and a warm atmosphere make it a great place for after work or going out on the town
One dark and lonely night, my girlfriend and I were wandering on the upper east side, looking for someplace, ANYPLACE to get a bite
We wandered into Totoya, drawn by its Toyota-looking sign and a desire to make fun of it
We were surprised by the amazing quality sushi and inventive combinations
With better decor, these selections could sell for 3-4 times as much
This place is the find of the year (and next year)
In Short China Fun specializes in huge, meal-sized bowls of soup, like Cantonese wonton and roasted duck noodle
The menu also includes roast pork, duck and chicken, barbecued honey spare ribs, sushi, a variety of dumplings and dim sum treats like scallion pancakes and roast pork buns
Big portions for small prices attract locals to the casual space for lunch and dinner, and the counter does brisk business in takeout
i called them to delivery n they hang up twice before i finished placing my order took 40 min to deliver and guy who delivered food gave me a bad face  when i gave him $3
50 tip for a $25 check(not the first time that happened) i order some sushi rolls that i had to throw it out because it was uneatable
chinese was okay
when visiting this area of the city, i always go to this restaurant
the food is terrific
i recommend the wontons in peanut sauce, the red bean bun, steamed dumplings, lo mein, fried rice, wonton soup
never disappointed!!!!
China Fun located in the residential 60s neighborhood is a change of pace from the other restaurants in the surrounding area
It almost feels as if you have entered another one of the hundreds of restaurants down in China Town
The food is pretty good but nothing exceptional
They offer both standard Chinese food as well as Sushi
Check the back pages of the menu for more healthy options
This place is always busy in the evenings
Due to their turnover, there is a lot of staff hustling around the tight seated space, but service is still somewhat slow
Try the vegetable dumplings for an appetizer!
the service was horrible at this place! our water glasses never got filled; ask for extra duck sauce and never came; removing our plates before we were done
table next to ours: i asked for green tea and you gave me black tea WE ONLY HAVE 1 KIND OF TEA! WE DON'T HAVE GREEN TEA!!! I can't blame the waitstaff because they were too few of them doing too much
hence, the bad attitudes and slow service
Food was just OK, my dish was a bit salty and my scallion pancakes were overcooked
My lunch on a Friday lunchtime was marred by continual truck traffic on 2nd avenue - - both noise and exaust
Food was so-so at best
Listen, Its not the top of the line China, but for pound for pound , it really good
Big portions of soup and main dishes help you out while the decor is pretty drab
However when you get your check, you'll be pleasantly surrised you only paid $20/pp and got such a great meal
Ipecac with rice and noodles
Just rifle through trash cans outside and I guarantee it will have more nourishment and taste
The decor is dreadful, and reminded me of a Chinatown Happy Ending Parlor, if you know what I mean
Good food and reasonable prices
China Fun is well worth a visit
I doubt that China Fun could thriive in Chinatown
But in midtown Manhattan, it is quite good for a fast lunch
The price is good, service is fast, and the dishes are sometimes too salty but sometimes flavored right
The roasted duck noodle soup is nicely done
The Scene A tony and prosperous crowd bustles through the door nightly and is greeted by the affable owner Giuliano Zuliani, who seems to know every client by name
Tables are neighborly--and it can get loud, but it's a gregarious loud, not a drumming one
The Food The menu reads like those at dozens of other northern Italian spots around town; the difference is dishes here are dead-on authentic, just the way you always hope they'll be
It might be vitello Abruzzese, perfectly cooked veal layered with rosy prosciutto, fresh peas and sage, risotto under a blizzard of white truffles or pristine roasted sea bass with a drizzle of herbed olive oil
Pastas are unfailingly good: Look for the fettucine with a stellar cast of Mediterranean shellfish in a briny, basil-laced broth, linguine with clams and mussels and orecchiette with garlicky broccoli rape
Desserts are limited but satisfying
The only drawback is that it is not a big restaurant and on a busy night it can get a little crowded at the bar and noisey
If you are not a regular, a MAN, or are not prepared tot overtip the maitre d, be preprared to be treated badly and pushed out the door fast because they need the table, so they can make room for their power diners
Overrated food and very average atmosphere, too noisy, overpriced, and cramped
There are so many better Italians on the east side
Primola is everything the upper East side wants: good Italian food, with a variety of options, service and prices to match
The food is not exceptional but it is consistantly good, making it a popular neighborhood spot
Go easy on the breadsticks, they are addicting
I was searching citysearch when i came across this restaurant
i had a wonderful time there!!! I had been searching for a great northern Italian Restaurant---there aren't that many---believe me!! Food was delicious!! It looks like I'll be a regular soon!!! Staff was very polite and sweet!!
Silver Spoon can be your home away from home, if you want
After dining there twice, all the waiters will remember you and what you ordered the last time you were there! They will make anything you'd like, and are always happy to throw in an extra muffin, fruit salad or coleslaw with your meal, (on the house)!
When invited to dine at the Lenox room by colleagues I was expecting a much more pleasant dining experience than I had received
Although the decadence of the place is very chic and the food and drinks are adequately priced I would not recommend it to anyone
The service was autrocious in fact my order came out wrong and our wine was never repoured throughout the entire dinner, which lasted 3 hours
I felt as if the servers could be a little more personable instead of so conscious of the way they stand
its as if they are in the military!
We celebrated a friend's birthday at Lenox Room, and we all had a good time
The food was good, the decor nice, and we had the nicest waiter! He was extra attentive, very friendly and super polite
He made our night there a very enjoyable one
I'd definitely go back again
The previous 2 reviews giving this restaurant a 10 rating gave me high expectations for Lenox Room, so I was fairly disappointed with my experience
The decor, while trendy and attractive, is generic and reminscent of many others such as Icon and Compass
The food was good, but nothing special - the duck was good but its sauce was a little salty, the sole was fairly mediocre, and the chicken was a little better than a cheap meal at a diner
Appetizers and desserts were so-so
all in all if someone were to invite me there again i might consider saying yes despite the horrible slow service, but otherwise I won't be back in a hurry
A perfect experience from the moment of reservation to the blissful dessert selection
This is what a New York restaurant should be
Staff is incredibly attentive and accomodating, and the fare is even better

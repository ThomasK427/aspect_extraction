Rays turns out average pizza at best
It shouldn't be in the same ranks as John's and Lento's as it is on this list
I don't like my slices heat lamped for hours and hours and then re-heated and served
Something about that disturbs me
2 Thumbs Down
I can't believe i've read good reviews for this NYC institution
Canned sauce, too much cheese, thick crust
The poorest excuse of a slice in the city
Save it for the tourists and go to Joe's
For years nothing satisfys my craving for pizza other than Rays
Lately being depressed over lots of all I do is crave Rays
I eat 2 slices and I am feeling better
Thanks to the founders of Rays Pizza
In a word Ray's pizza is quite simply the best
There are other places u can go to in this city for some pizza
Some are hip and stylish, some are fance, and some r just plain cheap but if u want old fashioned NY pizza the way it was meant to be then u go to Ray's
Some people say it's the cheese but those who know will tell u it's the water that goes into the dough that give the pizza it's thck NY taste
Either way if youre tourist lookin for that authentic NY flavor or just in the mood for a slice Ray's is the place
Typical NYC pizzaria, nothing special
Nothing wrong with it, but I'd personally go someplace else for better pizza
To a New Yorker, where you go for pizza is a reason to or not to marry someone
If your intended likes Ray's pizza, they're definitely a keeper
The slices are huge
The prices are low
The toppings list is endless
And, the pizza passes the all-important grease test: if you stick a full roll of paper towels on top of one slice, the oil will soak all the way through and STILL drip from the slice
Now THAT'S good pizza! ;)
Maybe not the best pizza in town, but a solid place for a quick slice
The countless locations around the city and a decent variety of pizzas to choose from makes Rays a good place to visit
great slices -- we go there everytime we are in town
It;s economical, and doesn't take forever! We have recommended this place to everyone we know
Pizza is okay in an area stocked with good eats
The staff always seems put upon when ordering anything not premade
The price is high for gourmet slices and looks like leftovers at all times
Stop by if you are in a hurry, otherwise walk to any of the other 20 or so pizza places in the area
They make the best tasting pizza ever! It's inexpensive and always has great service
rays pizza is great for anytime of day!!!! its delicious, always prompt and always hot!!!! oh my goodness what a wonderful treat rays pizza is and always will be!!!!
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
I am appalled by how bad and expensive this place is
I've been to many Fridays but everything was poorly handled from service to food
The prices are outrageous -- my entree of shrimp and chicken was $22 and was pre-made (which our waiter confessed)
Sadly, my bill was $62 after an appetizer, an entree, and a few drinks
The service was unruly and not attentive
In short, it was a disappointing evening confined by expensive, disgusting food -- coupled with equally bad service
Our bill was $52 for two drinks and two appetizers
We couldn't finish any of it because the appetizers were overcooked and the drinks were straight cheap liquor
Bad idea
If you're hungry and nothing else is open in the area (as we were), go hungry
I've been to many great T

I
Friday's in my time, but this is NOT one of them
The atmosphere is fun like most T

I's, but the food and service was awful
I was suprised by the quality of food since I've always enjoyed dining in other T
G
I's, but so far, I don't recommend any of the one's in New York (Manhattan)
Thankfully, the mudslide (which they were out of the first time I went) was amazing the second time (when they actually had them again
) I'm sorry, but how can you be out of mudslides on a Friday night! Very disappointing
The Scene Caricatures adorn the walls of this famous 1926 steakhouse-- labyrinthine stories of dark wood, faded paint and closely packed tables
Regulars, some of whom have been coming for decades, consist mostly of business diners and families who love the place for its atmosphere and doting waiters
The Food This location is the flagship of the international chain
It's the original and ostensibly the only one that still uses dry-aged beef
Steaks, however, can be mealy and low in flavor: rib eye slices too easily and lacks that cut's famed beefiness
The porterhouse, too, is soft and depthless
The restaurant also offers classic Italian dishes, but entrees like bland veal marsala, smothered in unsubtle sauce, fails to impress
The signature Gigi salad, made up of shrimp, bacon, tomato, and onion, is tasty enough, as are other starters, like the spicy, buttery lobster bisque
I have been to various Palms over the years at the various NYC locations as well as the Palm in Vegas
I hadn't been to the original in several years and I am glad
The medium rare fillet was overcooked/overcharred
The pink portion was not juicy and bland
Overall, a shocking disappointing
This place - like every other famous NYC steakhouse - has its gimmick
This place's gimmick is cartoon characters on the wall of 'true' regulars
This place is SMALL
You are right on top of the people next to you
The waiters are a mixed bag
Some are well experienced and have been there for years
Others are quite green and very unsure of themselves - you can almost hear their greetings and responses come from a script they have been taught
The food is on par with other steakhouses but is by no means 'the best'
The desserts are worth having
$10 valet parking on the weekend is a nice touch
I cannot believe a steakhouse of this caliber does not have a homeade steaksauce
They give you a bottle of A-1
WHAT???
I've been there many times with business functions, guests, etc
Each time, they prove to you that if you know nobody, you are nobody
You'll need your picture on the wall to get any respect from the old, snobby waiters
The food is ridiculously priced and very mediocre
And, if you or a guest only wants a 3 lb lobster, forget it, thats too small (read: too cheap) for them to serve
I've never spent $800 for a party of 6 and felt so dissatisfied, and cheated
a $60 steak better activate every tastebud in my mouth
sadly my 20+ ounce porterhouse had LITTLE taste
furthermore, not a single steak was prepared as we had ordered it
Half my steak was medium well, part medium rare, part medium
but perhaps what left the worst taste (and aftertaste) in our mouths besides the over one hour wait for our food was the hefty $600 bill for our party of 7
was i full? yes

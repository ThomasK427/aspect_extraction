It's a shame because was a great place
What happened??????
If you want bad chinese at greatly inflated prices this is the place for you
We have eaten there and ordered delivery from them many times and each time is worse than the time before
Last time, they were out of white rice, so I accepted the brown rice, but when the food arrived the rice was dry and it didn't even stick together
The spicy pork with bok choy was dry and fatty at the same time and had almost no flavor at all
The shanghai duck noodles were mushy overcooked, and under seasoned
The food was so bad that I couldn't even eat until I was full, I had to stop so I could come on citysearch to tell everyone I could about it
And best of all we paid more than $30 for the pleasure
Next time I'll go to the place on the next block
Just went to NYC for the first time this weekend, and was bar-hopping with some locals when we decided to check No
1 out
It was around 2:30, and there were plenty of people upstairs, and even more downstairs in the amazing lounge
Bartenders were friendly, and the drinks (esp
the lychee martinis) were delicious
They were $8 each, but definitely worth it
The decor was fabulous, and the mini-rooms in the wall downstairs, complete with lots of pillows, were perfect for late nights
The best part of my trip!
No
1 Chinese used to be my favorite restaurant
It featured only the freshest meats and vegetables and absolutely no MSG
Although the food at No
1 was more expensive than other Chinese restaurants, the quality of its product made the prices completely acceptable
For some sad reason, No
1 has recently changed chefs, and the food is not just of a lesser quality - it's horrible! The meats are now tough and clearly not fresh, the sauces taste cheap, and the vegetables are poorly cooked
I hope that the old No
1 chef returns; in the meantime, I'm in the market for a new Chinese restaurant in the East Village
Terrible delivery! We ordered veggie dumplings and they came with meat in it
Sauteed bok choy was like eating weeds
Very expensive for tiny portions
We asked for fried noodles with our soup and they told me that it was extra - what?!?! Four of us ordered 4 main dishes, 3 orders of dumplings, 1 order of ribs and 1 soupd and it was $90!! All this and they give us 3 TINY containers of rice, not even pints, smaller than that
Never again
This place used to be treasured for it's higher-quality spin on cheapo chinese fast food favorites, like using fresher, more flavorful ingredients
Too bad because I went there last night the food tasted just like it does at a regular chinese take out joint- too much salt and not enough fresh flavor
The menu is tired and they need to revamp it
The servers mixed up our order with the table next door and we had to switch plates
Then they brought us the wrong check!! No
1 used to be something special but unless they make some changes soon you might as well go to chinatown and get better quality for half the price (
as long as you are willing to cross Houston!)
This place was great
Hot bartender working this past friday and everyone there was friendly
Great date place and we ended up just eating at the bar
They have a downstairs but we decided to stay upstairs
Food was moderately priced and they have happy hour specials
Normally I wont eat out at a chinese restaurant but I am definitely going back here
Sweet and Sour chicken was excellent and so were the chicken lettuce wraps
Every time I stop by for one of their lemongrass martinis, I end up staying for two -- okay, three
The food is delicious (lot of vegetarian options)
This place just has a really good, friendly vibe
I love this place
I crave the food all the time
So you may have to pay a little more than the other chinese food in the neighborhood, but it's definitely worth it
The food is the best chinese I've ever tasted, and I'm sure the most healthiest
I mostly order take out at the weekends but I've dined there once and it was pretty good too
I was looking for somewhere to hold a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend
I wanted to have 40 guests and I wanted somewhere that served good food and was more of a club than a restaurant
My friend recommended the Lounge at No
1 Chinese
It's strange because not many people know there is one! It was a hugely successful evening
They have several large dining tables downstairs with sofas and cushions which makes dining enjoyable
The DJ played hip-hop/rnb/club music until 4am
All of my guests were so impressed! When making reservations ask for the Lounge by the fishtank!
It doesn't look much from the outside and I was sceptical, however totally surprised
The hostess offered us a table downstairs at the back which was totally secluded
The food was excellent
We went for drinks in the Lounge afterwards was packed full with people
There was a pretty good atmosphere, a dj was spinning and people were dancing and having a good time
it's not your average chinese restaurant!
This place is wonderful - for ambience, decor, drinks and groups! It's tough though to shell out $$$ for CHINESE FOOD when you can get it in chinatown for pennies!! I think that's where other reviewers rate this restaurant below average! However, I've been here 3 times already - with groups - and the ambience is amazing! It's cute and dark
and very conducive to having a fun, lovely night on the town! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED on my end!
With hundreds of better Chinese options in this city, there is NO reason to go here
The hot and sour soup tastes nothing like hot and sour and is so thick, it's congealed (and with squid?)
The rest of the food is mediocre at best and way overpriced for the quality
It's not even really Chinese food - more like American Chinese fast food
The service is bad as well
The waiters and host could care less about you and they seem to allow their staff to talk on their cell phones will working
Like many, I have had my share of chinese food from a variety of places in my 20 + years on this planet
This is one of my favs
The chow mein with its crispy thin noodles, all white meat chicken, fresh vegetables, and tasty sauce is delicious and filling without leaving you with that uncomfortable stuffed feeling
Before trying this dish I had ordered more traditional menu items like: chicken w/broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, and sesame chicken, and found myself being slightly dissapointed
So I recommend ordering something different than usual takeout options
The ambience and the decor are great--low lit , great mix of music (love when they play new wave), and the restaurant is decorated with imported items from China
So if you are in the area
or not and in the mood for some Depeche Mode and General Tsos--try No 1 =P
Great food, wonderful venue
Small tables, but apparantly there's a lot more space in the other room
This decor and ambiance of this place is great, food is good, not great
It took an hour after everyone was seated for them to take our order, although we had a group of 20, which is probably a lot to handle for any restaurant
The restaurant was packed with large groups, so that probably had something to do with the slow and rather hap-hazard service
I was accidentally served chicken dumplings when I had ordered veggie dumplings (which does not make a vegetarian very happy)
Two people in our group weren't served their food until a half-hour after the rest of the group (and we had all order
Portion sizes were a bit small
The best thing this restaurant had going for it was the ambiance and the fact that it had a dj
I probably won't go back though
The food was delicious
We had General Tso's chicken and a roast pork dish
both were very tasty
We also tried some steamed broccoli and an assortment of other vegetables
also very good
The duck sauce tasted homemade as well and added that little extra something

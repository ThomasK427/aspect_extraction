it would have been better if they left in the pot for a couple of extra minutes
Service was mediocre
The server was inattentive
On the good side, the restaurant has a nice ambience and the food is priced right
My biggest complaint is the lack of items that are individual-size portions
Everything is family-portion except for drinks and desserts
The irony of it is, the restaurant is situation in Middle Village/Union Square where most of the diners are college students and local businessmen
My date and I had to share the same appetizer and entree eventhough I wanted pasta and he wanted chicken
We ended up sharing the chicken with spinach and mushroom
After dinner, we wanted to split a dessert but our surly waiter said desserts are single-size portions only
I think the concept is ridiculous for a restaurant in the middle of Manhattan
It would work better in Little Italy or NJ
That said, the food was okay, not fabulous
The waiter was prompt but rude
I probably won't go back again
There are many other Italian restaurants in NYC that provide better food and service
The food is good, especially the lobster
However, the family size portions they boast about never materialized
Went recently with friends for dinner
I had the spaghetti with tomato basil
They changed the type of pasta I wanted with no problem, the food was fantastic, I was full and they gave us a drink on the house
I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!!
Fantastic food and speedy delivery
I think the person who says it has a wierd taste must have had very bad luck because I think this is the most authentic thai I've had in NYC (and I'm comparing it to food in Thailand)
If you love thai food you'll love this place
I eat at or order from East Village Thai at least once a week, and absolutely love the food
You wouldn't necessarily take a date there, but who cares when the curry is so good? I recommend the green and massaman curries (the former is spicy, the latter is sweet - both are fantastic), as well as the Tom Kha Kai soup and the Nur Num Tok beef
Order an extra rice if you're getting delivery (which comes quickly and is well-packaged) - you'll need it for all the extra flavorful sauce!
the food here is ok but Ive had much better
The Pad Thai was serviceable but had some strange flavors and the veggie rolls were a bit odd as well
I would go with Sea Thai or Pongsrit before EVThai
For such a small place, the food is great
The entire dining area is about 8x8 and consists of 3 tables
They serve the best Green Curry I have ever had in NYC
Also, their pineapple fired rice is awesome
Prices are pretty good, but for a better deal go during lunch
The only thing I have to complain about this restaurant is that they just don't give enough rice with their Dinner dishes!
If you've ever wondered what it would be like to have dinner in a Thai family's house, this is it
The food is fresh and delicious
Even the Pad Thai, which at every other restuarant I've eaten at is greasy, is healthy here! Plus, the folks behind the counter are super-friendly
The Scene For more than a decade, this romantic stucco-and-beams outpost in Greenwich Village has been cosseting loyal habitues and a sizable crop of celebrities
The two main dining rooms are equally engaging, rustic and roomy, animated with bursts of fresh flowers
The sky-lighted back room is particularly pleasant at lunch; at dinner, however, it holds larger parties and can get loud
The Food The northern Italian fare is simple but very well-executed
Lightly breaded calamari, roasted radicchio with smoked mozzarella and meaty portobello mushroom caps make for good starters
Pastas are usually right on target, with highlights like rigatoni with broccoli rabe and sausage, penne tossed with sweet peas and mushrooms and ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta
Big, lush desserts are the fashion here, whether bulbous apple cakes and pear tarts, frothy tiramisu or rich chocolate cake
During restaurant week, it is always so disappointing to be snubbed by the servers who regularly expect those with a higher tab
So I was pleasantly surprised when our food was fantastic and the service at Il Cantinori outshined the food
Our server was fantastic and always made sure we had everything we needed
He even brought us a huge dessert platter to share rather than our own desserts for my birthday and a glass of ports on the house
The hospitality was amazing and I can not wait to go again
I had heard from a friend that although yummy, Il Cantinori was much too pricey
I managed to get a reservation for Restaurant Week and had a lovely experience
I hadn't realized how romantic the restaurant is - low lights, candles, roses on the table
The service is exceptional as well
We were seated immediately and pleasantly surprised that our glasses of wine were generously poured
My boyfriend's tomato, mozz and basil was fresh and I loved my raddichio and parmesan salad
We both had the rigatoni and found the portions on the smaller side but delightful
The tiramisu was unforgettable! (Skip out on the biscotti and definitely order the tiramisu instead!) A quick glance at the regular menu wasn't too daunting - the prices seem pretty average considering the caliber of the restaurant
We definitely plan on returning to dine from the regular menu!
We were a party of six looking for a dinner place spur of the moment and a passerby on the street sent us here
Place was crowded but they managed to seat us in about 15 minutes at a nice round table close to open windows in front
Bartender was friendly and made a delicious Sidecar during our short wait
My yellowfin tuna was cooked perfectly medium rare, pasta dishes at the table were served hot and very tasty, another fish was proclaimed very good(can't remember which one) and the waiter very attentive and friendly
This was a surprise visit so we had no expectations going in, and I think that is half the game
Overall an excellent dining experience
We had a party of 11 for my husband's birthday celebration and had a wonderful experience
The service was outstanding
We never felt rushed and the staff made us feel welcome and comfortable
In fact, before we knew it we had been there for 4 1/2 hours and they never rushed us
The food was good, not the best
The atmosphere was perfect for our celebration and I would definitely recommend this place
Il Cantinori is by far one of the top Italian restaurants in NYC (and i've tried most of the well-known ones)
From the gracious staff, to the delightful atmosphere (not to mention rediculously amazing food), Il Cantinori is always a #1 choice
The food is simple, yet perfect
nothing is overdone or over the top
I recommend the sliced steak special and/or gnocci
Is it a MUST!!!!
Early dinner
we were greeted by our host who was obviously busy dealing with his empty restaurant
After he found a cure for cancer we were seated
The wait staff takes great pride in making sure the tables don't rock, adjusting them through out our dinner
Ordered chicken special which was descibed to us completely different from how it was served
We were told after inquiring, The chef decided to prepare it this way tonight
A waste of time money
They should be reminded they are selling food
get back to the basics
Lunch menu felt cliched, and very small
Only 1 special: common old salmon
Filet Mignon had a cream sauce and spinach, there was something mediocre about it
Avoid glass wines -- the cabernet was deeply frightening, even scarring
Prices much higher than competition, some entrees break $20
Il Cantinori is well past its prime
Avoid
In this neighborhood, there are many superior Italian choices (Beppe, I Trulli, Da Umberto)
I just celebrated my birthday here and could not imagine a more perfect dinner
We were doted on by the waiters all night--they brought out a dessert plate and popped open a bottle of prosecco for us, free of charge! They even gave me a rose when they came out with the bill (which was much lower than we thought it would be)
Tuscan fare was delicious and traditional, starting with pappa al pomodoro -- I would highly recommend the ravioli and the swordfish
I don't remember the last time I was at a restaurant in the city where I loved every bite, the atmosphere was nice, the service impeccable and the price not ridiculous!

Talk about not having one's act together
I called and made a reservation for 8
30
They called back to say it had to be changed to 9 PM
I said ok
They called again and said it had to be at 10 because they had accidentally created two seprate reservation lists
Huh?! Are you a professional extablishment in NYC? Becuase this standard of service is not going to work! It is not as if they are busy due to high demand
they are just too inexperienced to keep their lists straight
I asked them to cancel
never going back
I visited this restaurant this past weekend and although the atmosphere and design down to the silverware was very modern meets village, the restaurant was awfully cramped
The entrees and appetizers were completely overpriced for the quantity received compared to other high-priced restaurants
My freind requested their Lemongrass Mojito and was told that they did not have any rum in stock and they made the drink with vodka instead
I ordered the Tuna appetizer and was also told that they did not have that on hand
We asked why they were so short on items featured on the menu and they said they did not have a large storage space to stock items
Despite the downfalls of such a lack of space, the food was very fresh and the servers were very attentive and polite
Try other upscale restaurants on your list before making your way to this one
Compared to other fusion places, D'oh Ahn resulted in A for effort
Each dish was well marinated, cooked and presented
I like the overall experience, but it was not memorable
There were no wows and enlightening reactions, but it is worth a visit
We had a great time here
The food is a modern take on traditional Korean favourites
Great decor also
The staff were friendly and knowledgable
Highly recommended!
The restaurant is now called The River Room
The Earl Monroe partnership has split and the restaurant is under new management
We were celebrating my husband's birthday
The main reason I chose this place was for the view
We were seated with a window view of the GWB and the Hudson River
After tasting the Mixed Green Salad with Sage Dressing, I knew we'd be back for more
The food was simply amazing! From the salad to the duck (with no fat!) to the salmon my husband had to the scrumptious deserts, everything was perfect!!!   The service was friendly but verrrry slow and unattentive
Looking around it was just our server and not the rest of the staff was very attentive and quick
The owner came by and chatted with us for a few minutes
There was a jazz band playing live music
It turns out that Tuesday night is Salsa Night - we'll be back for that!
What a disappointment! Made a reservation weeks in advance for a Valentine's dinner with friends
Got put at a table we didn't want because one we wanted was reserved for friends of the owner
Extremely slow service
Waited 20 minutes for a drink, 45 minutes to place entree order after being seated
Ate butterless bread and ice from my non-refilled water glass and finally got a cold $35
steak
Staff was friendly but inexperienced and oogling over TV stars dining nearby
Earl is NOT present nightly but his business partners seem to be the main guys here
Place is pretty with nice view
but no chic, cosmopolitan jazzy ambiance here
Feels more like a cinder block and steel building in a State park after all
Wait about 2 yrs to give it a try, 4 real
I spent a sublime evening at this jewel of a restaurant last night
The setting is an airy pavilion in a park built out over the Hudson with a spectacular view of the George Washington Bridge
The service was friendly and attentive, and the food, from bread course to dessert, was out of this world
Bluepoint oysters on the half shell were sublimely fresh and tasty, as was my companion' salad, which he forced me to taste as the dressing was conspicuously delicious
His aged steak (expensive) and my Cajun pasta with bay scallops (cheap) were equally good dishes
Good wine list and excellent bartender round out the general splendor and all-around good vibes
One suggestion: the color-changing lights are beautiful but they change 5 times faster than they should
Slowing them down would make the place more subtly prismatic and less like a 70s disco
I dined at Earl's with friends for my birthday! The food was great, the service was very nice and Earl was very, hospitable
It was more like visiting the home of a friend rather than a restaurant
The decor is really nice, a great place for parties, wedinnings, outings with colleagues
Just a great place overall
The decor is chic and the shrimp and grits were the hit amongst my friends
Love it! Good Luck to Earl and his wonderful team
They know what service is about!   Just a note, you have to go through the gates of the park
nice lil' hideaway
Don't keep this place a secret, tell all your friends
A little bit of Miami Chic in Harlem!
Dined at Earl Monroe restaurant last night with friends
Had the aged prime steak which was devine
Later moved to the bar for and after dinner 20 yr port that was very good
Sevice was a little slow but I also understand they have only been open for two days and have not had time to work out all the kinks
Earl came in while we were eating stoping at every table as he made his way to his have dinner
I felt this was a very nice touch
Over all I would give it 3 stars
Best of luck to Earl and Marita
I am usually not to adventurous of an eater (chinese food in harlem) but when I read the review of Ginger in TimeOut, I was very intrigued
The atmosphere is great, servers are very competent and eager to please
The food was simply amazing
The ribs were the best I have ever had and my chicken dish was also great
And to top it off, who ever heard of a chinese restaurant with a good dessert selection! Great find, will definetely be a regular
Highly Recommended
After a very long workday(sunday)We asked for delivery
We waited 35 minutes and nothing
We called and this is what they said
We are busy and your's is the last delivery which will be another 30 minutes,we are keeping it in the warmer
why did they not tell us when we ordered?Besides saying the minimum order is $25 to deliver
All of that should be on the menu for delivery
We cancelled
Had a great time at this unexpected place
Service was good, our server was friendly and joked around with us
However at times seemed a little distracted
Food was nice the Coconut Chicken with Noodles was very tasty
Will be going again
The food is amazing and the place is great
It is a breath of fresh air
The service was good and friendly
For the type of food and ambiance it is a steal, my date loved it
This place has great food but they need to do something about the service
Just basic stuff like knowing the menu and remembering what drink they were getting you
I recommend because the food takes at least 45min

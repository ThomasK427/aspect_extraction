Back in the days when the humble, lovely owner was around, service was great, but haven't seen him in awhile
Now it is generally nice but at times inept
Still, for great food and a great value, this is one of the best
Try the pesto, I've never had better
Same for the focaccia
Cute atmosphere, great food, good service - I would def come back here
I also like that it's on a side street
I had one of the salads and the grilled chicken - both were great! Everyone I was with loved their dish
Four of us visited Buon Gusto one summer evening, and sat in the garden in back
We had to essentially walk through the kitchen to get there, which was a bit sketchy, but once back there it was very lovely
The food was delicious, well made, nice size quantities
The service, however, was awful
The waiter would disappear for 20 minutes at a time
We ordered wine, and he came back and substituted a different vintage without saying anything
After dinner, he brought over our check, even though those who ordered prix fixed still had dessert coming to them! When I gave my credit card to pay, he disappeared for 15 minutes, and it wasn't until I went back inside to find him that I was able to sign and leave
Overall, excellent food and bad service means consider take out or delivery
Side note: Amex is accepted
Food is amazing
Service is amazing
They need to get a better chianti on their wine list but otherwise, everything is truly amazing
Yum
I can honestly eat here every night
My boyfriend brought me to this restaurant on a Friday night and the evening was absolutely enchanting
The restaurant is tiny; the walls are lit by tiny candles and the dimness and low hum of conversation makes for a very romantic atmosphere
We waited for about 10 minutes for a table, but it was worth it! As we reveled in our cozy corner table, a waiter brought us wine and a delightful foccacia bread to nibble on
Our dinner? FANTASTIC
My boyfriend's lobster pasta was unforgettable and my chicken buon gusto was so large that I could only eat half
We were so full that we turned down dessert
However, the waitress came over with a complimentary homemade tiramisu! It goes without say that we decided to make some room in our tummies for such a treat! This caffe has already become my new neighborhood favorite
My wife and I ate here for the first time last summer on a Friday night
The tables are very close together, even for New York, and the place was packed, making for a very claustrophobic feel
The food was good, however, and we put it on our list of places to try again
We finally went back last weekend on a rainy Spring afternoon, travelling all the way from Queens
What a difference! There were still plenty of people there, including a large party, but not so many that we felt crammed in
This gave the food a chance to shine
The crab meat ravioli with shrimp sauce is highly recommended
My wife had a seafood risotto special that was also fantastic
The service was wonderful and the wine recommendation was spot-on
We would definitely go again, but maybe stick to quieter times
Absolutely one of my Favorites Places to eat in Manhattan this place is too Die for! The food is and I would recommend everything on the menu! If you are looking for a really laid back place, that the people are extremely kind and generous
I have never had better tuna, and my dinner companion had nothing but enthusiasm for her pasta special
It is a very comfortable, very reasonable, neighborhood spot
When we were there, there were 10 diners and 4 people at the bar, and it felt like having dinner with friends
I will definitely return
Poor organization (and poor treatment of dinner guests by the evil manager) ruined an otherwise lovely meal at Buon Gusto
We were practically pushed out the door so that another group could have our table, after ordering a three course meal and wine
Our waitress was pleasant but slow, and the food is simply not good enough to be treated like a nuisance
The food is just as good-with far superior service-at the Buon Gusto on Second Avenue
Off the beaten path, this restaurant is well worth the trip
Service was excellent, a good selection of breads to start, delicious pesto pastas and other entrees, and a decently priced wine selection
You feel a little like canned sardines if your chair is anywhere in the middle, but they open the store front windows in the summer and have outdoor seating
Run by real Italians, this place is a great spot for a date or dining with a small group of friends
A reservation is worth making
The food is truly amazing, with great atmosphere to boot
Buon Gusto is great choice for a refreshing meal
I had a great salas and the best grilled bass in a while
The service could be a little more attentive but was overall a great place to grab a bite
I haven't been to the restaurant yet, but I have to say their delivery is fantastic
The food arrived quickly and was hot and delicious
A little pricey for delivery food, but excellent nonetheless!
I went with a group that totaled 9 on a Sunday afternoon at around 4 pm
We were immediately seated by a very friendly staff
We were served focaccia bread with a robust olive oil for dipping
The menu was extensive, with many options to choose
The food was served quickly
Everything was freshly prepared and tasted wonderful
Not one of us made a questionable choice
The portion sizes were quite reasonable - you didn't get overwhelmed by a huge pile of food you knew you could't finish
It was a delightful, satisfying meal
I would go back in a heartbeat
every time I have been there, the food has been delicious, the service courteous and everything is prepared fresh
The fish and meat is always fresh too and the food is very tasty, unlike most italian neighborhood restaurants, which can get commercial
I had a birthday party there for my friend and everyone raved about the food and we had the enitre place to ourselves, it is so quaint and cute! never crowded, and the food is well worth the visit!
This little bistro tucked away on 77th street, can easily be overlooked by most bypassers, but its worth a trip! Sunday brunch or late dinners, the best home cooked Italian meals, fresh fish and meat and a gea wine selection is a treat to the palate! and the ambiance, is definitely cozy enough for all occasions
The little Italian girls serving the cuisine also add to the charm!
I've been here several times and the food and service are consistently good
The staff is always friendly, attentive, and doesn't mind how long I linger
I recommend the gnocchi with any of their sauces, but especially the chicken broth with peas and mushrooms, and I also recommend the file of sole
After having quick delivery for a few months, I checked this place out for lunch on a Saturday
Excellent value!! Extensive $4
95 lunch with choice of soda or soup! Portion was sufficient
Service with a smile
This place is awesome!!!
Tomashi is one of the best deals on the upper east side
The service, food and prices are the best! If you are looking for great Chinese/Japanese food and to top it off free wine come to Tomashi!
This restaurant is truly the best kept secret in NY
The food is great and the prices are lower than anywhere I have found
They deliver 40 blocks away too!!!
I've been dining here for the past 5 years and have consistently had great food, amazing service and excellent wine
I have never had a worse experience at a restaurant in NY
Staff was rude, had to wait far too long and no apologies (even with a reservation)
Would never go back
What happened to this restaurant?
Haven't been here in many, many years
this went from a favorite in the '80's to one of the worst Italian restaurants in the City! The pasta was swimming in bland, flavorless sauce, the veal was also over-sauced nothing special
The average age of the patrons was about 70, the food reflected it
The neighborhood pizza place makes a better sauce!
We sat in their provate room in the back for a 13 person party and it was very cozy
The staff prepared a price fixed menu for us and everyone loved it
The room is also their wine cellar

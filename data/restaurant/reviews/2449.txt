i've read the reviews here and other sites, and they are pretty much true
the 18% gratuity tacked onto the bill automatically almost made me walk out
the food was hot and good, but i have to be honest, your grandmother can probably cook just as well
the restaurant is small and tight
we went on an off night, so we didn't have to wait (it was a sunday and EXTREMELY cold)
the catfish strips were delicious, and even though i couldn't finish my food, i did finish that
the bread basket you can send back without touching, and the lemonade was poor
the restaurant is clean, and the service was just so-so
don't go out of your way to eat here
if you happen to be in the area, you're hungry, and here's the key
there's no wait, then eat here
I have been to the Shark Bar about a half dozen times and each experience is different
The service is ok, but I am a waitress and I know I give much better service
The food is good most of the time and you get a good portion for the money
I notice in most of the reviews that everyone keeps talking about the 18% tip and that is a customary percentage
That is not outrageous and if you are going to dine out that is what your supposed to leave and if the service was good then atleast 20%
This past weekend (11/12), my friend and I went here and we thought that they were really trying to change their image based on previous negative reviews
I was quite impressed to see that the service was pretty good
The waitress was attentive and personable (though I had to remind her she didn't tell us the day's special-she may have been new) and made sure we received our food in a timely fashion
I noticed a few people using credit cards and/or debit cards
Our drinks were pretty good
It does appear that the 18% tip is included however
Also, check your receipt just in case of any oversights
The food is great, finger licking good, but the drinks are horrible
Taste like water
Also, they don't except credit cards anymore which is so inconveinent
Other wise the place is okay
Nice place to take a date
I took my little sister here for dinner the other night and the waiter informed us, before he even greeted us, that the shark bar only accepted cash
This is the only restaurant in NYC that doesn't accept credit card
even McDonald's take credit
I don't understand how I am suppose to spend over $150 in food and drinks and then be expected to pay cash
On top of their cash only policy they automatically include an 18% tip to each bill--regardless of how good/bad the waiter is and the size of your party
The food was questionable and the waiter got loud when question about the 18% tip
I would stay away from the shark bar unless you walk around with a lot of cash that you want to waste on so/so food
This place has really become lazy
The waiter stared at me like I could read his mind
I had to guess he wanted to take my order
food- Bland sorry attempt of a soul food meal I asked for my brownie dessert to go, he returned with a very noticeably stale brownie wrapped in saran wrap! My friends and I were totally disgusted when we realized the gratuity is automatically added to every bill so his tip was set
Now we know why there is no need to be personable
We flat out told him he did not deserve such a large tip and asked to speak with his manager
She was just as bad, as soon as we started to explain why we did not agree with the gratuity charge she grabbed the check and walked away in the middle of my friend's sentence
RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!
I visited the Shark Bar this past Saturday night (11/6/04) and I will NEVER go back! I have been there previously and was very much looking forward to dinner
Unfortunately, the wait was ridiculous
We waiting for over an hour only to be told that we would have to wait at least another hour! Meanwhile, people arriving after us were being seated
It was insanely crowded and so I was being pushed the entire time
The hostess could not give me a straight forward answer and we ended up just leaving
so much for a classy dining experience! PS
As people were walking out they were complaining about the horrible service and the tables were way too close together!
I've been going to the Shark Bar since my early 20's and now that I'm about to tie the knot-I wanted to go back to the place I spent many nights at the bar, before going to the Lyons' Den Nightclub
I remember when the food was exceptional, the waiters were FINE and it wasn't so cramped
The food is at best a 6 out of 10
I had the Chicken and Rib Combo and I swear the sauce on the ribs was more ketchup than BBQ
My waiter's shirt and pants were wrinkeld-and they closed the roomiest section of the restaurant
The Shark as we used to call it was a See and Be Seen kind of place
Now its a place were unassuming folk go to hang out
Thanks for the memories
The Shark Bar was a big disappointment
I have heard good things about this place and I get there its so small
The lights are so dim that you need to hold the candle up to see what you are eating
The waiter was not attentive he gave me the wrong drink twice and the bill for three people who had appertizers, a drink and an entree was $200
00
That was not worth it and I don't think i'll ever do the Shark Bar again
I had the Blackend Chicken, Mac Cheese and Candi Yams with a Lemonade
I ate everything off the plate! The Chicken was 2 nice bonless pieces
Could have had more portion of the sides
Lemonade nothing to talk about
People Sit almost on your lap, they are so close to you
The music did not fit the scene(reggae Dancehall) for the romantic setting they portrait
Very Dim Lighting that you can barely see your food
Last but not least BE AWARE! GRATUITY was added to a PARTY of 2 for 18% and it was stated a party of 4 or More on the menu
The couple next to us was charged the same
I will not be going back here
If this is not enough information for you
See for your self
Any time I have out of town guest I take them to the Shark Bar
Their food is consistently excellent
If you go on the weekend the wait can be long and it gets crowded, but once you are seated it is a comfortable dining experience and well worth the wait
This is my favorite restaurant in NYC
A friend and I went to Shark Bar on a Wednesday night - and the service was lacking
The hostness was pleasant in sitting us
Our server rushed to tell us the specials (we had JUST sat down) When we were ready to order (she wanted appetizers and main course at the same time), they mistimed the courses
Our main course sat on the table for at least 10 mins before we were ready to touch it
Everything you'd expect in a soul-food restaurant
Even the bar is lively with men watching sports-- NBA basketball in our case
There are two dining rooms, one secluded and one not
The main courses offer more food than you can eat unless you're a sumo wrestler
Crabcake appetizer very tasty/spicy
Meatloaf looked like a Fred Flintstone Brontosaurous Steak in size
The side dishes are the most fun-- collared greens, corn-on-the-cob, and (yes!) delicious Mac n Cheese amongst others
Waiter was very friendly and helpful w the menu
Probably best on a weekend, though we were there on a Thurs and the secluded dining room was empty
Every time I visit New York City, I make it a point to eat here
the food is great and they give you large servings of everything
Be sure not to miss the macaroni cheese and candy yams which are close to moma's
My fiancee and I went this pass sunday after a show
There was a little bit of a wait and the line to reserve a table could have been managed a little better, but once we were hosted to our table I have never had a more pleasant experience
We did wait a while for our food, but once we received our entree's we knew why - both of our meals were excellent - my fiancee has to be the worlds most pickest eater, needless to say he finished every bite of his dinner
This is soul food, but it is fresh, non-greasy, with a nice clean, flavorful taste

Service is terrible
Waiters have no idea what they're serving
The pho, a staple of vietnamese food, was essentially rice noodles in an MSG broth
Basically, all the food on the menu is a half-ass'd attempt at vietnamese food, followed by a innappropriate heap of MSG to make up for the lack of any flavor
Come to think of it, a lot of the food on the menu isn't even Vietnamese at all
Unfortunately, the best Vietnamese food in the city is still at those tiny places scattered throughout, where all the waiters know and only know Vietnamese, and the menus are horribly translated
ok - 3 appetizers, 7 entrees
delivered in 10 minutes
REDICULOUSLY FAST!!!!  awesome
don't go here for impeccable service
if you want good portions of tasty food delivered promptly to your table, this place is it
for an even better bargain, go on weekdays and take advantage of their lunch specials
you won't be disappointed
I love Saigon Grill!!! Their dishes and prices make my day, especially the cheap lunch specials that can feed more than 1
Make sure to try the curry
The service is quick and food comes up in no time
The only downside is that this place is so popular that you might have to wait awhile during dinnertime
I've been to many a vietnamese restaurant but this place tops the list
I've had them deliver food to me, and have eaten there on many occassions and they have not yet disappointed me once
My gf and I always get the curry ga and the bun xao, two great dishes, but definitely not the only good ones available
Check this place out for inexpensive, delicious vietnamese food!
This place cannot be beat!! Not only is everything quick, fresh, and delicious, they go out of their way to please
On the most recent occasion, I called ahead to find out if there was a wait (it was Saturday night)
The girl who answered the phone said there might be, and when she found out I was on the way there, she gave me a seating number over the phone just to ensure that when I got there I wouldn't have to wait
How many places in this city can you say would do that
particularly since they get so much business that they really wouldn't have to be concerned about satisfying one customer if they didn't want to
I give it a definite two thumbs up, and that's just because I only have two hands
Casual restaurant that seems as if it has been remodeled (they added a sushi bar and numerous sushi chefs) and is not as dreary as one would come to expect from other posts
Good appetizers included beef satay, spare ribs
For entrees, the whole fried sea bass was good
It was not at all greasy and lightly flash fried
They did go a bit heavy on the sweet and sour sauce though
Small cherries where the eyes should be kept son entertained
Also good was Bo Luc Lac beef teriyaki in cubes that was served medium rare
The Bun Xao noodles were ok too
I must be missing something
It's inexpensive--but our food (a stirfried chicken entree and pork entree) was terrible
It was poorly made, the sauce was thickened with corn starch and not at all savory, and it was totally inauthentic
(Note: I didn't try any of the rice paper rolls or ceviche--which, from the next table, looked pretty good
)   Service is lovely, polite and on the ball, but that can't save the food
With the recent renovations the place is double the size
I go almost every week either for take out or to dine in, sometimes with large groups, and there is never much of a wait
They expanded their menu and now offer sushi
The sushi is good, but is obviously more pricey than their vietnamese dishes
The service is fast and the portions are huge
We are always shocked when we stuff our faces with food and drinks and the bill comes out to less than $20 a person
Saigon Grill rocks!
What I ordered: Shredded Green Papaya Salad, Appetizer Plater, and Chicken Pho ($15)
The food was delicious! The papaya salad was topped with wonderfully flavored grilled beef
All the meats have no nasty pieces of fat
The food is all about quality
The beef tasted similar to Korean barbecue
It went great with salad
The dressing was just a sweet vinegar and it was great! The appetizer platter was great for my first time
I got to try beef and chicken sate
The egg rolls were okay
But the sugar cane shrimp was the coolest experience
I got to bit and chew on the delicious stalk of sugar cane and eating the fried shrimp paste
The chicken pho was wonderful
It was plain and not too salty
The free tea was downright soothing and medicinal
The service is beyond attentive and courteous
Every glass of water is paid attention to
Great and inexpensive food! Large portions
(You could easily split an entree, but you wont want to!) Long lines (for good reason), but they move fast especially for couples and small groups (easier to seat)
Can't rave enough about the food
Fast, attentive service
The food is on your table minutes after ordering it
They move fast without really rushing you
Although, there is a bit of an assembly line feel because of the close quarters and speed at which food is served
Don't expect a deep or romantic conversation here (it's loud and you'll be too busy eating to talk)
Best Asian-style food I've had
(Note: Saigon Grill is not strictly Vietnamese food
Its Asian food with a Vietnamese tilt
) It is the kind of restaurant that you will go to over and over again
The food is delicious, reasonable priced, and the portions are enormous
The only drawback is that the place is so popular! A long wait is inevitable at normal dining hours, but it's worth it
Try the spring rolls, bun (noodles), seared beef, curry shrimp soup - it's all good
Great selection and variation on the menu and the prices are CHEAP
However, be prepared to rub elbows with the folks next to you
The service was surprisingly good despite the crowd
We asked for extra mint leaves and they were very accomodating
We were a party of two and were sat almost immediately
Larger groups had to wait a while
We were seated immediately
Not being familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, we found the menu descriptions very helpful
The food was served quickly, and was delicious
For two, eating until we were more than full, the bill was under $20
The bathrooms were exceptionally clean
A good value, I will be back
I met a friend here for dinner a few weeks ago
I was so pleasantly surprised by the food- it was the first time I had Vietnamese and it was great!! The service a bit rushed because it is a packed place! Everybody comes to the restaurant, young, old, students, couples, groups, it seems like a great regular spot, and the prices are great! And the servings are plentiful; Try a fruity cocktail while you are at it! I love the mai-thai
Make a reservation if you are with a big group
Great, light food that is delicious
You cannot beat the prices
Favorites are Crispy Twin Delicacies, Ga Sate, Vegetarian Spring Rolls, Bun Xao
Recent move to a bigger and more welcoming place to Amsterdam hasn't changed the fact that they're always jam-packed
I eat Saigon Grill food three times a week and I never tire of it
The food will not blow you away, but it's consistent and almost everything on the extensive menu is great
The new location offers many more seats and less waiting

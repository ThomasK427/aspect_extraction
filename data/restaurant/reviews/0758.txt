All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
I am a huge fan of espresso and i found best espresso in the city
Of all places in McDonald's!  coffee has a compact, fine-grained, long lasting crema and fine buttonhole and it tests Earthy and Woody
This place is excellent!!! Been there a few times already, both in large groups and in a quaint setting, and it caters to both exquisitely
It's very warm and pleasant inside, When it's warm, it has nice outdoor seating
It is a restaurant that most of the spots in little italy near them should strive to be
Very reasonable prices, excellent portions, all in all, an absolute score in NYC
I always recommend it to anyone in the area!!!!
My friend and I found this place and the food was amazing
The portions were great and the prices were reasonable
The restaurant is small but quaint and the smells that blow outside of the restaurant, can be smelled a couple blocks away
We loved it so much at lunch that we shopped in the Village and Soho and went back to Due Amici's for dinner
This place is average
at best
The staff is arrogant, the prices are way high for Brooklyn
and for some reason people flock to it
Don't waste your time or your money
We love this place
Our family loves this place
The food is always fresh and delicious
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district- far better than any restaurant in the area
Chef Vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real Roman
His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14)
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink
Yes, NYC is expensive, but with the state of this econmic situation, I'd figure a nice place like this would offer more for your money
This place is exorbitantly expensive and actually not worth the price
My date and I made a reservation at Bacco for Valentines day
Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were informed that the menu was Pri-fix for valentines day
no one ever told us of this when we made the reservation
Of the 3 main entrees, they ran out of the chicken, and we were allowed to order something off the main menu
We ordered the Halibut, which was undercooked
They also ran out of one of the two dessert selections from the special menu
The waitress couldnt keep track of anything
it was the worst service I have ever experienced in a NY Restaurant
The martini with fresh watermelon juice is refreshing on a summer afternoon! This is a charming break on a busy SoHo street where you can sit and watch the tourists rush by
This place was a great find and we'll definitely go back again for a wonderful meal
The prices were unusually reasonable and we had great service (especially for a Saturday night without a reservation)
The atmosphere was very European and cozy, a great spot for a romantic meal
This is a nice little restaurant on the ever-bustling Spring Street
The restaurant itself is elegant with funky light fixtures
The service was good - although they were a tiny bit too lax, still, it's better than pushy service and they were very friendly and nice
The variety of food was also very good as were the prices
However, the desserts - good as they were - were comparitively overpriced
e
g
the pasta I had for lunch was $12, but my dessert, which was a small slice of apple pie, was $10! Despite that, it is a very nice restaurant
I was quite happy with my food (although it had a bit too much salt), and everyone else with me seemed to be satisfied
While the food is not excellent, it's certainly not bad
It's the kind of restaurant that will not disappoint you and you will leave content
went here on a date, had a wonderful time
staff was very friendly and offered great suggestions
food was delicious
appetizers, entree and dessert and wine were all perfect, and its not obscenely priced either
the bathrooms downstairs are quite interesting too, reminiscent of roman bathhouses?
I looooove this place
It's right in the middle of the village, but doesn't boast village prices
It's a great date spot and cheap for take out- who could want more? My boyfriend and I have made this our regular spot since we're both addicted to the spicy chicken and coconut milk soup
Try it, it's awesome and really hot
I don't really understand the reviews citing bad service
We never had a problem- is it really a big deal to flag down a waiter when you need the check? I seriously think this place is one of the best kept secrets in Manhattan
Great ambience
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint
Never again!
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff
The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner
Everyone I bring here always loves it
The prices are good and the amtosphere is nice
However, the worse service I have ever had, inattentive, rude waiters! Food is okay for the price, however there is definitely better thai restaurants!! NOT WORTH IT!! To many great restaurants in the area to waste your time here!
What a find!!! Unbelievably inexpensive and yummy food in a soothing atmosphere
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table
We go often
The food is nothing like its menu description
The curry chicken I ordered was way too oily and bland; I hardly tasted any curry or coconut, which they said it contained
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red)
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like)
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment
Stay away from this place
All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs
The atmosphere was something off a postcard from Thailand
Bamboo hanging from the walls, a beautiful waterfall, you name it
However, the food was nothing like what I was hoping for
Salty, starchy and bland, everything Thai cuisine isn't
The satay was chewy and overly spicy and the chicken with basil and peppers was low par
The wait staff and obviously the chef were not from Thailand
I felt like I was in a truly authentic Thai restaurant but was served low grade Chinese take-out
A major disappointment
ate there 2 weeks ago and can't stop raving about this place! The food was delicious and at a very resonable price! I had a appetizer, drink and meal for under $20! Definitely try the mango shrimp! Nice intimate setting, good for dates
Tables are a little too small for groups of 4 or more
Wild Ginger's food was very good, although I found it to be a bit greasier than I like my Thai (almost like Chinese in that sense)
Ingredients, though, were fresh and portions were generous
The price tag was ridiculously low

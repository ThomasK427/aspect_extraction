You can order off the menu for a real treat, enjoy the decent wine list and reasonable prices
My husband met the owner of Da Tommaso in a local hardware store and they began to talk and he mentioned his restaurant
We thought we would give it a try and have been going to it ever since
We have recommended it to many people and no one has come away with a negative review
This is my favorite NY restaurant in the theater district
The service is great- the food is delicious- and the atmosphere is quaint
My only complaint is that the tables are a bit crowded together- where aren't they in NY??? The desserts are outstanding- especially the tiramisu and the fruit tart
If it's not on the menu, ask for the string bean and goat cheese salad- delicious
be careful when orderibg a special- they tend to be qite a bit higher priced than the entrees on the printed menu
Enjoy!
We went here late on our last night
I wish we'd found it sooner
Great food, and very friendly and attentive waiter
Only watch out for the refills on tea
While I though we were finally eating economically for once, the cost of tea was outrageous! Being from the south, I assumed (yeah, I know) that refills were free
I found that most places in NYC charge for each drink
Ouch!
I love this place
When I lived here, I used to eat here frequently, took everyone here and told everyone about it
The food is excellent, the service is great
It's not your trendy, in place but can boldly compete with any of them any day
I've never had bad service or bad food here
Bedazzling to our eyes, an entertaining venue for creative decor and people watching
The food is spectacular- splitting a pizza or two as an appetizer is a must
Desserts are creative and a great topper to a solid meal
The food and its presentation were excellent, unfortunately that was all I enjoyed
The restaurant is small
The bar area is crammed into a small space and the dinner tables are on top of each other
I thought I was going to a trendy and special upscale restaurant and what a saw as soon as I walked in was a tourist restaurant with lots of children with their parents
The lights were very bright also killing any leftover chance for atmosphere
This place can only be reccommended for pre-theatre dining or an upscale family or tourist experience
The service was also not up to par
It took 10 minutes to place our 1st drink order
I am shocked by the negative reviews
I had dinner a few days ago and it was great
Impeccable service, great food and a fun atmosphere
I would return for another special night out
The best part of our meal was the dessert
If you don't want to pay the price for dinner and are celebrating a birthday this is the perfect place to go for dessert
We went to Circo last night expecting a nice Italian meal
I had the lobster bisque and Softshell crab both of which were specials
The lobster bisque had a pasty bitter taste and the softshell crab was deep fried, served on a bunch of greens it had 0 flavor
My husband had a salad which he said was average and then pasta which was overcooked and too salty
We love to eat out but this was a big dissapointment
Even the atmosphere was not very pleasant
I am afraid that I would deffinately not recommend this restaraunt to anyone
You see, Mort and Bibby went to this here place and had an amazing time, this is a different kind of place, a place that takes down all other places, a place that allows her to enjoy the fine cuisine, delectable wine, and cushy seat cushions


boo-yah!! But seriously folks, this is one helluva a place for a fancy ass bite to eat!!!!!!
No, it's not going to knock your socks off, but I've always had a warm, pleasant experience here (both lunch and dinner), though lunch is by far the better deal
Servers and maitre'd are gracious, and the Italian food is solid and hearty
Dessert is a must
There are kinks, to be sure: avoid the over-buttery polenta unless you want to clog your arteries right there in your diamond-pattern chair amidst the circus streamers
Overall, though, it's a fine place if you push the hype out of your head before you go
Spinach ravioli was excellent but the Salmon entree was lousy
Salads were tasty but a bit uninspiring
Sorbet arrived completely melted
They didn't offer any butter or oil for the bread
Service was lousy
Waiter looked at me like I was asking him to shove a stick in his eye when I asked him for a second glass of Pinot Noir
Maitre D's were helpful and friendly
My boyfriend went here for restaurant week and was sadly dissapointed
The selections were bland and uninteresting, and the Buffalow stew was downright uneatable
It was so chewy and dry I almost choked on it
I would definitely NOT return
My wife and I went during restaurant week
I had the roast boar special, my wife had the chicken under brick
Both dishes were lacking in intesity in color and flavor
They were also both oily and heavy
A real dissapointment for the price
While the host, the service and the staff couldn't be nicer, and the room is diverting (if not looking a liitle worn around the edges for some reason, maybe its the chairs and tables), the food simply was not as good as expected or should have been
Menu is enticing and presentation is fine but, the dishes were not up to the level required from a place like this
Maybe I ordered wrong but, it seems the kitchen needs some new oomph
Me and a good friend went in August and found the atmosphere to be great as well as the food
he did'nt get alot on his entree but the pizza I had was delicious
no complaints here
Quaint, colorful decor and savory offerings make Rice and Beans a certifiable cultural experience
A little pricey for pollo, but your pallate won't be left unsatisfied
Its small but its great for takeout
very affordable
people are friendly and its a cool atmosphere
kinda small maybe about 8 tables if that
totally recommended, yummy and well-priced! excellent delivery presentation! great plantains and the phone order taker was very nice
:)
I was surprised with this little Brazilian resturant
It is so small it hardly qualifies as arestaurant-as we see it in NYC-, but the food is simply delicious and the service _done by natives-was above average for the prices they charge
Try the feijoada if you're really hungry, and if you have a chance ask to speak with the owner, she is this sweet brazilian lady who will take the time to explain to you how everything's made
Possibly the worst restaurant I've been to these past couple of months
The service was slow
The food was horrible
I paid 17 bucks for rice and bean pork/ sasuage stew
The pork flavorless
Not enough sasuage
The stewed beans were pretty flavorless too
I got an extra plate for my friend for 6 dollars
The plate came with 2 slices of orange, yellow rice n some vegetable
What a ripoff at 6 dollars
I also got some cod fish fried with onions, potatoes and egg
The cod fish was tough/chewy/cold and flavorless and cost 17 dollars

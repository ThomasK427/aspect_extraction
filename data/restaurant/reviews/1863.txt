Even he loves this place and suggests going there all the time
We're on our way tonight, too
This is a great spot for the girls that like the asian flavor and the guys that are a little more about steak and real food
Actually, those of you who are tired of Japanese should try Korean here
I don't know why there aren't more fun Korean restaurants in the city not located on 34 st
anyway, make sure to get the crab dumplings, filet mignon, tuna, bibimbop
you can't go wrong
You can definately find the same quality of food for a fraction of the price elsewhere, but the decor and ambiance of Woo Lae Oak make the experience worth it (though it is not a place I would frequently go back to)
The portions are tiny and some too sweet
But the model-esque waiters are some added eye candy
Its great for people who want to try Korean food, but can't understand the servers or the menu on 32nd St
So we've all heard the stories about Woo Lae Oak
Though some of them are true I wasn't dissappointed at all
Yes, there is a wait and the food is more expensive than Koreatown, but consider the location and quality
Also think of the perks- the waiters look like they just walked off the run way
It was a great restaurant and I will definitely be going back
Pricey, but delish! Good cocktails too
The ambience is great - perfect for a night out with the girls, but also a great place to impress your date
The manager that claimed that he was the manager was so distastefully pompous and rude to my friends and I that we walked out and decided not to eat there
I am Korean and live in the neighborhood and usually eat in Koreatown, but unfortunately we decided to eat there that night
We were so put off by the manager there, we decided to leave and never give them our business
I don't know what everyone is complaining about
It's New York City
you have to wait on Fridays Saturdays for a table everywhere else
This was a great place and it never fails to impress me
Check out the new huge Buddha head in the window
Awesome ambiance food
Though you hear scathing comments about Woo Lae Oak, try for yourself and you'll see that everyone is wrong
The food is great, the service is fast and the decor is so SoHo
Yes I was aware that getting into Woo Lae Oak on a Saturday night even with a reservation required a wait
We've been here on many occasions and are happy to wait at the bar
The food is always good and the service as well so all in all it is definitely worth the wait
I'm really picky about what I eat and really don't like 32nd St food
It's scary and half the times I don't know what I'm looking at and ultimately will be eating
Woo Lae Oak is just right for diners who are interested in enjoying Korean cuisine without all the fuss
I come here often with large groups and yes, we have had to wait a while for our table
After about 30 minutes we were getting kindof angry but in walks this celebrity couple (no need to drop names) and we were so wowwed
Go check out the chopsticks wall and you'll see what I mean
Trendy - yes
Pompous - yes
An aura of cool - yes
The best looking male waitstaff in the city - ABSOLUTELY
The quality of food is excellent (albeit somewhat expensive), but the service is marginal
Not quite authentic Korean
rather with a Soho twist
But, ladies, the men taking orders/serving food are GORGEOUS!! I'm assuming they're all aspiring actors/models
but bringing the girls here just for the eye candy is worth it
Again, the service kinda sucks
but who comes for the service with hot waiters and great food??? Highly recommended
I came here with a few buds who are visiting from out of town
They're really not adventurous with food because they're from the MidWest, so I thought barbeque
What better place is there where there's a grill right at your table?
When most people think about Woo Lae Oak they think model waiters pricey food
A few of my co-workers and I decided to see what all the fuss was about and yes, they do have beautiful waiters and the food is more expensive than what you'll find in K-town, but it is so worth it!! My perception of this place has changed so much since dining here and I will undoubtedly be returning soon
We went with a group of four this past Friday night
The service in the upstairs room was terrible
The waiter was not helpful and did not seem to know anything about Korean food
The waiters failed to bring half of the food that we ordered and never came back to bring us water or to check if the food was okay
We had to ask several times to get water
There are so many great Korean restaurants in the city; it is not worth wasting your time at this one
Don't come here if you're looking for Korean food
Yes, its decor and sleekness may lend itself to a romantic evening, but don't expect to impress your date with your knowledge of where to get good food
I don't understand the notion of Nouvelle Korean if this is it
Rather than reworking tradition, Woo Lae Oak suppresses that which makes Korean food unique
My friends picked to go here for New Years Eve dinner
After seeing the citysearch reviews I was really worried about getting a table
Well, there was no reason to worry
Not only were we immediately shown to our seat, our service was awesome
We had the BEST dinner
We ordered way too much food and still wound up only paying $50 each (including more than enough food, a drink and tip)
I think that's amazing
I would highly recommend this place, though I do worry that perhaps my experience might have been rare
Here's the problem - although the food is fantastic, both the more traditional items (bbq, Bi Bim Bop) and the more inventive ones (black cod, fried tofu in panko), and is surprisingly veggie friendly, the service, in a word, sucks
It takes forever to get anything and they are completely unresponsive to complaints
I walked out on my birthday because I was hungry and we didn't get water for 20 minutes
But, if you're not in a rush, and not ravenous and can sit and wait in a cool room, then the wait is worth it for some of the best food
It's not cheap, but I don't feel it's overpriced
The Mercer Kitchen and Lure are on the same block, and I think both are a bit more pricey
Great bar - lychee matinis are yummy
Good for dates, because you have something to do if conversation lags
If you have a big group of people do not go here
Management cannot deal with organization
We called to make a reservation for 8 and they said they had a table ready for us
When we get there they say 5 minutes and next thing we know its an hour later
All the time they are assuring us that it will only be another 5 minutes
The manager seemed flustered at our party and became aggressive and arrogant saying I dont like your friend and Id be happy if you went else were
And we ended up going else were and will not return and tell will tell others not to go here
I was there w/ a party of 8 last night for a 9pm reservation
After 45 mins of waiting in an sans air conditioned bar, we grew tired of paying for over-priced drinks
The manager did attempt to get us a table, but only at the expense of rudely asking another table to move for their desserts
Food wasnt worth the wait
I went there with a group of 9
We were hosting a group of girls from Austraila and thought it would be nice to take them to Woo Lae Oak for a late dinner
The Manager told us we would have a table in 15 minutes, so we patiently waited
1 hour later we were still not seated
The manager was nowhere to be found and the Hostess did not care that we were not seated
After something like this we would expect an appology and a free drink
That never happened
Diner food tastes just as good!
WLO is not your typical Korean BBQ joint serving traditional large portion of kalbi and bulgoki

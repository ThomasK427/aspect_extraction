The food is worth it, though
Amazing chicken cesar salad, too
Highly recommended just for the great food
Seriously, this is one of the best Greek restaurants in Astoria
It's not the kind of place you'd take a date or a group of friends for a night out, though
It's really more of a takeout joint
But when you're craving a gyro at 11pm on a Friday night, this is the place to go
The mini pizzas ain't too shabby either
ROMANOS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, CHEAP, VERY CLEAN AND THE SERVICE IS GREAT!! IT HAS THE BEST GYROS, SOUVLAKI AND PIZZA ANYWHERE IN NY
GOT TO TRY IT!!!!
It doesn't look nice and it is not a place to sit down and eat but they often have good pizza to take away
They can also deliver it
However it depends who is making your pizza, sometimes it is good sometimes bad
Seafood at one of New York's truly stunning settings
Editorial Rating: Recommended In Short Situated at the foot of the East River, this restaurant specializes in ambience
Strategically placed banquette seating allows every diner to glimpse a view of the East River, garnering the restaurant a "guaranteed-romantic" reputation
Executive Chef Brad Steelman prepares a French-inspired seafood menu featuring bluefin tuna and formal caviar service at dinner
Sirloin steak, rack of lamb, venison and crisp duck breast serve as entree options for non-seafood lovers
I almost past this great restaurant by reading the old reviews from last year
don't know about their past but I was there 7/8/2006
from the moment I drove up to the door, it was first class all the way
the 2 attendants immediately greeted us by opening the doors for my date and myself, we had an 11:00pm reservation and was there at 10:40pm, no problem
was seated right away and was moved to a table with a view before the drinks were served, food was excellent
so was dessert, but the service
outstanding
and I mean everyone, from the valet to the busboy
if you're willing to spend the $$$, then this is the only place to do it!
great great food
nice atmospher
though a little crowded for romance and they seem to pack you in
I didnt get a water view
so was a little dissapointed
but otherwise really really nice
next time I would definitely request a water view
Of course go for the view, but I was pleasantly surprised that the food and service was also on the same level
Not the most adventurous nor exquisite food, but generous portions (at least, on the 3-course prix fixe) that were faultlessly executed, complemented by a varied wine list ranging from that special bottle for a celebratory splurge to excellent choices under $50
I brought five guests from out of town, and we had a great time! Slightly overpriced for what it is, but I would happily go again
I've been to some highly-touted restaurants lately--Gramcery Tavern and Babbo among them--but none compares to the River Cafe
Beautiful setting under the bridge--especially nice at night when the lights are lit up
Flowers adorn the entrance, and a fresh bouquet is at the center of every table
The food was equally outstanding: I had the fois gras and rack of lamb, along with the Brooklyn Bridge for dessert
They threw in extras between courses like shrimp in butternut squash--delicious
About $125 pp so bring your plastic!! A+ experience overall
We didnt have reservations and valet was very nice while my husband went inside to check availability and I waited in the car
Unfortunately, valet was the only one who provided service with a smile
This place has definitely lost its charm, since I last visited it several years ago
Recently, I tried Foie Gras Terrine at the Craft and fell in love with it
The River Caf version of that appetizer was not nearly as good
The rest of the dinner was very average, too
The worst part was their electric candles
I saw guest and waiters constantly tripping over the cables
At the next table the light started flickering and the waiter actually crawled under the table to check connection
Poor lady grabbed her partners napkin for extra coverage since her skirt only went down to her knee
By invitation - I went to the River Cafe for my birthday
If you are in the mood for highly priced cuisine and scenery over size portions; then this place is perfect
Not an every week spot, but a nice place to take a date or have an informal business meeting
River Cafe has an enchanting view and extraordinary food
My fiance and I did the 6 serving sampling and enjoyed every single bite due to the unique flavor in each selection
It was more than enough food even though the portions are tiny
Additionally, the restaurant has beautiful decor throughout and our waterfront table was amazing! We were two of the youngest patrons (early 20s), but we were still treated exceptionally well
Even though we are native New Yorkers, my wife and I were dazzled by the view of the Big Apple
It was our 25th and everyone in the place went out of his/her way to ensure a thorougly enjoyable evening
Outstanding food and service
Pricey, yes, but we dined with the Statue of Liberty and the Woolworth Bldg
outside the window
It just doesn't get any better than that
This place does live up to the hype
I went for lunch during restaurant week
The food and service were first class
You must treat yourself or a significant other to this place
You won't regret it!
This restaurant is disappointing to say the least
When you leave the restaurant still hungry, you know you have a problem
Why is it on The Most Romantic Restaurants in Brooklyn list? The tables are close together and the staff is cold and unwelcoming
I would bet that the good feedbacks were there during the week or on off-times
My advice, try another place
A little pricey for a regular date but great for a special occasion
My husband and I went there for our anniversary some years ago, and still to this day the experience stays with us
We remember the light piano music, the wonderful warm ambience, the great service (so attentive yet half the time you didn't even know they were there- thats really good service) and the food
We have since referred many of our friends
We plan on going back there very soon
I took my boyrfriend out to dinner at the River Cafe to celebrate his birthday and it was such an awsome experience
The food was amazing
We had the stuffed shrimp and the steak tartar to start with, then the seabass and the lamb for the main course, and finally we had the sorbet and the chocolate cake for dessert
EVERYTHING was very very delicious
And the wine was even better! Our server was very attentive; she kept on checking on us and pouring more wine in our glasses
We were presented with a great service
Put all of that aside, the view was unbelievable
We could see all of NY city from our table
I had requested a romantic table with a nice view, and I sure got what I asked for
I couldn't have wished for a nicer experience! It was definitely worth the money!
I've never heard about the River Cafe until my girlfriend told me about her mentioned her wonderful experience there
She hadn't been there in several years so I wanted to surprise her for anniversary
The River Cafe truly exceeded my expectations from the minute the taxi drove the cobbled streets
My girlfriend, who was wearing a blindfold, bursted in sheer excitement as the taxi made its way around
We we're amazed by the great ambience that restaurant brought
We both felt the grandeur of the place and location because of our view of the New York City skyline
It was truly magical
I can't say enough about the wonderful service and breath-taking food
It was an evening that I will never forget

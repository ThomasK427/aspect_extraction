But some may like it
it's not to my taste
the service was good, and the bathrooms are nice!
The food was great
The veal cheeks just melt in your mouth, however the food doesn't make up for the poor/slow service
The waiters seemed more pre-occupied with each other than their guests
We spent almost three hours in the restaurant from the time we sat down, until we left
I went here for the first time last week with a group of friends
The atmosphere is warm with lots of class, but it is not so upscale that you feel uncomfortable
We had a 8 or 9 course dinner with a different wine with each course
The food was fabulous, the wine was exciting, the dessert was a treat for the palate
The waitstaff was attentive, but not vulture-like
It was one of the best meals I have ever had in New York
I would highly recommend this restaurant
In a town with so many great places to dine, Gramacy Tavern amazes every time you go back
Beautiful place to eat - just not amazing enough food for the price tag
Desserts were great - but the rest of the food, while beautifully presented, was just very good
From its warm and comfortable front dining room/bar (eat the roasted walnuts at the bar), to its sumptious seasonal tasting menus (which I would suggest you compliment with wine pairing selected by your server), to the restaurant's (and all of its staff's) attention to detail, I truly believe Gramercy Tavern is one of America's greatest dining experiences! Whether it be a last minute meal at the Bar, or a special occassion in the back dining room, you simply can't go wrong!
What can you say about the finest dining feast in New York City
yes it is expensive, but if you enjoy fine food and excellent service look no further
It's interesting but after eating dinner here once the only thing I remember is that the bar was nice, drinks expensive and food was only average
Service was good but we ate in the dining area instead of the more extensive/appropriate formal dining room
Bartender up front was great
He allowed me to sample a couple of wines by the glass, before I decided to try one
Really makes a difference
Dinner consisted of the tasting menu
Do Not hesitate to pay the xtra $10 for the lobster app
It's worth $25
Made the mistake of ordering the steak, not that it was bad but there are other places in NYC to get beef
We had the summer tasting menu which was wonderful
Every bite just melts in your mouth
The service was attentive
The back dining room is just classic
Taking yummy coffee cake home at the end of the meal was a nice treat! Will definitely return
Great place with great food, and great service
Food is layered with flavor and the desserts are exquisite
Excellent dining experience and the menu is always changing
Nice work
A dinner I certainly don;t mind paying for and I felt like I got my money's worth
Chocolate cake is the best in town
You can't miss it
I admit, I've become quite jaded with restaurants after eating at many of the worlds best over the past years
So I really am thrilled when I come across a restaurant that Wows me
Gramercy Tavern's food/service/value/wine list was all top notch
Highly recommended!
consistency is always a feature of this delightful restaurant experience
The food is always of the highest quality,beautifully prepared whether in the main restaurant ,or in the less expensive foreroom
The staff is very well trained,very pleasant,good humored but not overbearing
ihave never been disappointed in their offerings,and as with danny meyers other establishment,disciplined in their food preparation,and their service
Pricing is always fair;their wine list extensive with wines in every price category
After closing on our new home we stumbled on GT and decided it would be the perfect place to celebrate! It just so happened there was a photographer shooting the chef (his name escapes me) and we were treated to a complimentary entree for our inconvenience- not that it was
Service was fantastic, thought the traffic was light, but the food, my God the food was divine! My girlfriend and I are addicted to dining in NYC and would have to say Grammercy Tavern sits atop our list of favorites!
But you will not find one here
Further confused about there reputation for excellent service
The food was nothing special at all, we had the lobster and tuna tartre appetizers
For dinner it was lamb and sirloin
This place trys to hard to invent unique taste, the result was tiny portions of inadequate over spiced food
The atmosphere is very nice
Beautiful ceilings and wood surroundings
Tell the waiter to calm down, she was inattentive and initially bought the wrong appetizers
Many better options for the price
This restaurant is hands-down one of the, if not THE BEST in Manhattan
The ambiance and decor of the place is spectacular
It's obvious that much care and attention to detail was taken with the decor as well as the maintenance/cleanliness
You could eat off of any surface in this place, yet it still maintains a very WARM atomosphere
Secondly, the service is the best i've ever had - outstanding
They take hiring inherently friendly, classy people and training the staff, very seriously
Lastly - to send you over the edge and catapult you into heaven, the food is divine
Top-rate quality of ingredients, prepared to perfection
You can't go wrong here, unless you mistakenly go to different tavern
The owners obviously understand what good service truly is and how acheive it consistently
I will return here many, many times
Why do I keep seeing reviews about their great service? Either some of these folks have LOW standards or perhaps there is, indeed, ONE SERVER that isn't as inept as the one who served us! We waited 30 min
for the wench to greet us and inquire about drinks
Getting bread was a chore - the bread boy passed us over 3 times before he noticed my hand in the air, waving him over to which he replied, what do you need, ma'am?
The food was mediocre and a bit on the dry side (we both had fish)
Save your money, folks
Cucina di Pesce on 4th St
is a much better value
Beyond the fact this is simply one of the finest dining experiences to be had in the city, it is also one of the few best-of-the-best NYC restaurants that isn't a complete waste of money for vegetarians
If you ask for a vegetarian plate, you will be given several options, and they will all be prepared to the same standards of the dishes on the menu--no boring steamed vegetables or pasta dishes here! The waitstaff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and the ambience is a wonderful combiniation of luxe and relaxed
Great wine list and desserts too
Dumpling appetizer was mouth watering, no mixed drinks, the shrimp and scallop chili was fannnnnnntastic, the pad gra proao was spicy and lovely if you like hot and spicy
We will be back
My husband said the portions were great
The bathroom was clean
Everything was wonderful
In Short  People line up in droves each weekend for this infusion of country in their harried city lives
The outdoor tables overlooking bucolic Irving Place, or the wooden ones inside, are prime spots for brunch featuring all the usual suspects--omelets, pancakes, French toast--served on cast iron skillets and griddles
Patrons who opt to stay away from the morning crowds can choose from homey American entrees like chicken pot pie and shepherd's pie
This place is incorrectly named
They are not friends to anyone based on my expereince
The manager has no conception of how to treat a customer
He rudely would not seat one extra person although there was an extra seat at the table
Gave us an attitude like we were in the wrong
No signs posted or warning abuot their lame policy
Food was not good also
Many better restaurants in the area I'd rather go to
Don't waste your money there
Waited 30 mins for simple breakfast items

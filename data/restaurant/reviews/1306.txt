We liked this place so much that we went there for dinner two straight nights
The Jerk Beef and Thai Mussels were delicious
The Chilean Sea Bass and Royal Beef were perfect with wine by the glass or bottle
We had dim sum and sushi the next evening
The sake bottle was served in this charming urn of hot water and small flame to keep the sake warm
The dim sum and their fusia roll - spicy tuna, kani, lobster and avacado wrapped with soy skin were wonderful
Aside from their food, their staffs were very friendly and attentive that we've not seen anywhere else
The decor and lighting are warm and mellow, it's just the right place for couples
This place has become one of our favorite spots
I liked the fun retro-neo-post modern asian ' 2001' decor at Amber
My date and I sat at one of the casual bar tables at the front near the weeping pebble-stone wall
There's a brightly blue red light lit bar, a main dining area and a lovely back (indoor) garden room
Thumping music played throughout our stay and the general noise level was high
We had seaweed salads, shared 17 pieces of sushi sashimi, a tuna sashimi roll wrapped in cucumber, a bowl of edamame and some premium cold sake
The quality, presentation and portion size of the fish was very good
The service was terrific and I look forward to returning to try some other dishes
The bill came to $87
50
We just found this place two weeks ago and have already been there three times
There is a great variety to choose from and specialty rolls are incredible
We've also had the same waiter the last three times and he has quickly asserted himself as best of all time
Most attentive and friendly waiter in an expensive dark sushi lounge on the upper east side by far
My boyfriend and I went to Amber last night and had great drinks at the bar while waiting for our table
After we were seated we ordered some unfiltered Sake which was fabulous
Now the disappointing part
My boyfriend ordered Chicken Teriyaki and I ordered a sushi combination
His food was presented to him and mine failed to show up
15 minutes after he was served (and almost done with his meal) they told me that indeed my food was still in the queue at the sushi bar
It's uncooked food! What possibly takes that long?  With that aside it is completely unprofessional to serve one person an entree and not the other
His food should have been held and presented to us both at the same time
I cancelled my order and we high tailed it out of there never to return
I've visited this place about 10 times now, and have been a happy customer since coming here a year ago
The sushi bar, hot appetizers and pan-Asian main courses are excellent
The place has a hip vibe you'd expect to find downtown, not on the upper east side
Its a welcome change to the somewhat conservative neighborhood
For appetizers, I'd recommend the soft shell crab, spicy New Zealand mussels, calamari and anything from the sushi bar
Its all very fresh
For mains, the crispy duck, grilled Chilean sea bass, green vegetarian curry and red snapper are all wonderful choices
The wine list, imported beers and extensive sake menu should be satisfactory to most people
The only drawback can be the door staff
When it gets really busy, you may experience a little attitude, although this can be spotty
I'm a confessed sushi freak
I have been to hundreds of sushi bars, and Amber consistently has some of the freshest offerings I've ever tasted
The chefs are true artists, and they take pride in their presentation
Many sushi bars have lost the artistic appeal of their craft, but not Amber
Everything I order looks like a masterpiece, and tastes like heaven
Seating is ample and comfortable, and the atmosphere is very appealing! Even the bathrooms are gorgeous
It feels very chic, without sacrificing comfort or great service
Speaking of, the staff is very friendly and helpful
The green tea margaritas are not to be missed, either
Pricing is very reasonable, given the quality of the experience
I found this place to be an overall great restaurant, especially considering the neighborhood (many b-restaurants without much flair)
It looked more like a chic lounge than sushi spot
The decorating was great, the lighting, the music, all great and relaxing
The food too, definitely better than average! A little pricy but I thought worth it and will definitely go back
A great date spot, not far from Central Park
Make sure to check out the room in the back too
This has quickly become my favorite sushi place in the neighborhood
The atmosphere is nice, service is extremely attentive and the sushi is quite good
Some of the non-sushi entrees are a bit expensive and nothing special but if you're looking for a nice evening out for some sushi, this is a good place to go
Kudos for the service
Very good addition to the neighborhood
Walked in for an afternoon drink and snack
Very attentive service
We had ceviche and fried calamari, which are both quite good
Drinks menu is sufficient, and it's a nice place to chill in the neighborhood
Though, Asian fushion food often are not as good as authentic sushi or Chinese dishes
Worth a try
Tried Vegan for the first time and was pleasantly surprised - the food is of excellent quality, service was excellent, and a wonderful ambiance for a restaurant on the UES
A nice find on the too often standard fare trail of Upper East Side restaurants
When you're in the mood for something different yet surprisingly filling, go to Gobo
Try the seitan, it was great
Solid service, awesome food, and most of all, a relaxing environment with very friendly people!
Had my first ever vegan meal here which I enjoyed much more than I ever thought, it really exceeded my expectations
Unfortunately, the service at the door and in general were a bit poor, it wasn't a very welcoming experience
The feeling isn't helped by the kind of austere decor
If the service improved, I could be tempted to eat here at least once a week, the vegan food is that good
My girlfriends and I adore this place
It's a great place to enjoy healthy food
I had never tried making blind reservations before
I took my girlfriend to NY for her birthday for dinner and to see Phantom
The restaurant staff was wonerfully attentive , but certainly not pushy or intrusive
We had the table right inside the windows which gave us a wonderful viewof the street and all the interesting people passing by
My girlfriend had the halibut and said it was as good as she had ever had
I had the pork and really did not need a knife to cut it, it too was delicious
We had the asparagus as an appetizer which was a great way to start the meal
For dessert she had the Creme Brule and I had the double chocolate cake, both were excellent
Even the decaf cappuchino was as good as we have had in quite a while
Thgis is a restaurant that when we return to NY to visit again we will most certainly visit again!!!
One of my best girl friends and I went to Fillips a couple of nights ago and had an amazing meal together
We were looking for something authentically French and were uber excited to find Fillips
The service was first rate
The staff was down to earth, knowledgeable, and welcoming-- there's no French attitude here
The food is delicious
The portions are small compared to American standards but if you appreciate amazing flavors instead of huge portions, then you have to eat here! We sat in the outside seating area
Great place for a date or girls dinner out
I highly recommend the sea bass and anything else the sommelier/staff recommend
they know their stuff
Dinner was a rewarding experience - excellent food; wine priced at a great value; service was attentive but not intrusive; atmosphere is good for conversation
I walked in the door and was greeted by a very pleasant host

Hip decor do not make a good restaurant
The staff are prompt and courteous and the decor is edgy and modern and minimal but the food is nothing more than overpriced noodle fare which could be bought at half the price in Chinatown
Not a bad place to go if you're around Union Square and have no clue where else to go
Nothing stands out but nothing's horrendous either
THe food is good and the price is better
But be aware of its INNOVATIVE dishes (eg
Dish 20 on the menu)
What is it anyway? Appraently, the waiter knows it too - he warned me about the dish
Overall experience is great
Nice ambience and cheap food
Just don't go there on a Sat night!
Avoid this place if possible! The mediocre food is not worth the wait or the money
The atmosphere is loud, uncomfortable (with bench seating), and makes it impossible to converse with your dining companions
A bowl of spicy (rubbery) chicken soup was $9 and was not satisfying
The service was impatient and ultimately hovered over us to get us to leave
The deserts, however, were surprisingly good
This place might be good for those who never tried any asian noodle places
Nice atmosphere and hip staff
However, food is very overrated
This is type of noodle you can easily get from any asian noodle places
Therefore, it's also overpriced
You should get this type of noodle with less than 6 dollars
It's outrageous to charge $2 for a regular tea
Okay, the food was very good
I ordered a chicken noodle dish which was a bit too sublte for me
The cilantro, lemongrass and challots saved it
My friend ordered the curry duck noodle soup which was great
Our chicken skewer appetizer was also a knockout
The service was very fast even though the place was packed and the wait staff were real friendly
My bone to pick was the seating arrangements
Don't expect a table for 2
Expect to be seated with several other parties
I personally didn't appreciate having to hear everyone else's conversations while listening in on my friend and I
Would I return? Ofcourse but maybe not on a Saturday night
everything i've tried here so far is great - from the salmon broth, and also the cold spinach noodles, the grilled beef over noodles and the rice dishes - everything's good
as for the appetizers, i like the grilled eggplant or salmon sashimi salad
the grilled calamari is also great
good cocktails, too
try the frozen lichee martini
If you're looking for a place to eat tasteless noodles while you scream at your dinner companions to be heard this is the place to go
I am not sure why this place is so popular and trendy
The vegetable dumplings were good and other appetizers looked appealing
Order them when the restaurant isn't busy or move along to a restaurant that serves authentic Thai food
The food was pleasant enough
But the atmosphere is way too trendy and loud
You are seated on benches next to other trendy diners
If you don't really care about their conversation, tough
You have no other choice but to hear it as you are almost on top of them
My pad thai was good and so was the wait service
I would eat from there again but only as take out
My experience of Republic is essentialy a tourist trap serving pretty ordinary food
The beef I ordered was questionable to say the least, the cow (big assumption) must have died of old age
I couldn't cut it with a knife let alone the chop sticks that came with the meal
If you want decent cheap food try Spice or Evergreen - better priced, better food
Food wasn't anything special here and not worth the money, seems like chinatown food with a little twist
I'd rather troop over to chinatown pay a quarter of the price and get a hotter bowl of noodles
While it's definitely one of the more reasonably priced options on Union Square, and the service is pleasant and prompt, Republic's accolades basically stop there
The atmosphere is run-of-the-mill sterile trendy asian
Why does trendy so often translate into angular and cold? The calamari is chewy, and the noodles are ho hum
I've gone to this place a number of times for takeout only
The orders always come out very quickly
The vegetable dumplings are delish, as is their duck soup
Everything in the takeout bag is always perfectly packaged
I think they do a wonderful job there
I've never sat down to eat there, but it appears like it would be rather hectic and loud
I'd suggest sitting at the bar, where you can watch the kitchen
It's amazing to stand there and watch the cooks in action
Perfect if you're in the mood to grab something relatively quick after shopping in Union Square, or right before a movie
Bottom line, it's cheap
The food is not a knock-out; the selections are somewhat bland, but ingredients are fresh
Hot sauce is helpful
Large seating area
Noisy -- not intimate at all
Stop here if you don't want to blow your wallet on a real sit-down restaurant but aren't exactly craving McDonald's
This Union Square standby is where I take friends or co-workers if we want incredibly cheap eats and drinks not making a dent in the wallet
The best compliment is from my foodie friend who says for the price per entree the portions were quite substantial
Considering, he's a bottomless pit
Best hits are the grilled squid appetizers and the grilled pork rice bowl
On the liquid side, Lychee Martini and the Mojitos quenches the thirst
However, come after 8 PM, be patient enough to deal with the shoulder rubbing traffic by the door and the sometimes Diva-esque attittude from the Host or Hostess
Grab some matchbooks on the way out, they're chic looking souvenirs
Very delicious asian inflected food, incredible prices, fast service
Great bang for the buck!
One of the first restaurants I tried when I moved here, and still one of my favorites
It is usually crowded and noisy, but I prefer to say that it is lively
Great food, quick service
Delicious noodles of all types shapes and varieties
Excellent appetiziers
Don't go on a first date, since the place is always crowded and noisy
Where else can you go and have a meal and a drink for $15? Food is good, atmosphere is great (if you don't mind the cafeteria style seating)
Its always crowded, but never a wait to be seated
I don't understand why there isn't a blazing chorus of praise for this place -- don't NYU students have time to write reviews?  This is easily one of the best deals in the city, in an environment that may be a little noisy, but is roomy, sleek, and higher-end at low-end prices
I have never had a dish that didn't taste great, and for the cost, you can afford a couple of fun cocktails - try the mango majito or the Fuji apple cosmo
I definitely frequented Republic often during my first few weeks in the city, but that's just because I didn't know where else to go
The food is good enough, but a little pricey for what it is
the only things which I would look forward to there are the frozen lychee martinis, the fresh juices, and the decor
i've now given this place 3 tries and it has failed on every one
the atmosphere is annoying, loud, trendy and the food is so bland
plus, it takes an hour just to hail down a waiter
it is cheap, though

To Die For
I'm a New Yorker born and bred
I KNOW chinese food
There are fancier and more expensive places, but you will not be able to find a restaurant with fresher food or prompter delivery
I challenge you to name your favorite chinese food dish
They'll make it better than ANYBODY you know! Some of my faves from there: Spareribs, vegetable egg roll, vegetable egg-foo-young, pork potstickers, sesame chicken
I could go on forever
This place is hardly noticeable, but rest assured the food isn't
Now, Hunan Pan is hardly somewhere you would want to go if you're celebrating a special occasion, however, it is a great place if you're hungry and want quality food
I recommend the General Tsao's Shrimp! Oh yeah, the food is brought out incredibly fast
Very good Chinese food that delivers quickly for a reasonable price
They also offer Japanese although I havent tried it Good Value
OK, every nabe in NYC has a place like this, where you can get cheap, filling Chinese food at practically any hour of the day or night
But unlike most places, which could share the same menu, Hunan Pan's got its own identity, with both Chinese and Japanese options on the menu
Further, the food's a step up from the usual, too, though the classic dishes are all there
Great spot for lunch
One of the few places that actually does Chinese and Sushi--and both aren't bad
Never too greasy and veggies are fresh
Try the honey-walnut avacado roll
Service is good, too, and there's sidwalk dining
The Scene Owner/chef John Philip Greco and his wife Suzanne Marie Lonzar put together their middle names to create the French-sounding moniker for their wholly American restaurant
The space is cozy and welcoming: Large murals depict country landscapes and simple pleasures, while the smell of hearty food lets you know that some of those pleasures await you
The Food This hidden gem charms crowds with a carefully prepared, market-fresh New American menu
Servers start the meal by bringing a kettle full of steamed Prince Edward Island mussels in lightly seasoned broth
Generous dishes such as grilled spinach and artichoke heart-stuffed chicken breast with tangy citrus sauce and garlic-basil mashed potatoes offer a pleasing balance of flavors and textures
The pork chops and grilled sirloin steak are prime cuts
Comfort-food side dishes such as an extra-creamy bowl of creamed spinach are recommended
I'm an old man for crying out loud and have lived and eaten in over a hundred countries in this world and all over this country
Let me tell you that there isn't a place on this earth where I have experienced, in my not-so-humble opinion, consistently superb food and excellent service
John Greco is a genius (I should know)
One afternoon Mel Brooks was at the next table and telling John's wife how much he enjoyed the food
So I interrupted and asked, It is really fantastic, isn't it? He chimed back, And the price is right, I'll tell ya! And that is an additional perk, and comes directly from Mel and me!  So listen to me
Go to Philip Marie
Tell them I sent you
Ask for Herb, but don't believe a thing he says about me -- I'm a very nice person
And if you don't believe me, ask John Greco
Did i mention the guy is a genius? He's got a way with a spatula that's spectacula!
Last night I went on a date at Philip Marie
Can I say it was fantastic
The food was possibly the best that we have ever ate
We started with an amazing warm mozzarella salad(to die for)
We then shared the Lobster spring roll (the freshest that I have ever had)
For our entrees we had a most tender wild boar and the most melt in your mouth lamb shank
The server that we had was so professional
He knew exactly what wines to pair with each course
I highly recommend this establishment to anyone who has never been
I also must say to make a reservation because the place does fill up
My sincere compliments to the chef and staff for a wonderful evening
I just had to wright something

Went there 3 times IT JUST GOT BETTER AND BETTER
The food is five stars

you can eat, have cheap beers at happy hour and watch the show walk by
the inside window seats are beautiful too
Just when we thought there was nothing better, Philip Marie outdid itself
We love the Tuesday Clambake and weekend brunchs
We brought friends to brag about our find, only to be wowed again
The chef created specials that blew us away
We plan on attending their next wine tasting dinner in October
The last one was amazing!  We can't wait to enjoy the private room for 2 for our anniversay
Thanks to the great staff for always making us feel at home
and then some
A spectacular place! The staff is great and the food is wonderful
A must go on their special celebration days
Mardi Gras was unbelievable
There's never an issue when you're taking people into the city for a wonderful meal because you know that this restaurant always delivers with their food and service, they consistently receive high marks
They also make you feel as if you're home with good friends and this was true even on our first visit
Highly recommend
Philip Marie has a great atmosphere
It is a nice needed change from the busy streets of NYC
It's relaxed, with soothing music
very romantic
Perfect for dinners with family and friends, or the ideal restaurant for a date
Our food was delicious! Great service
What's not to love? Definitely one of my favorite places in the city! I highly recommend it for your next meal out!   A+++

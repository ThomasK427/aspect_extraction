Mr
C needs to find some reality-based, customer service oriented staff ASAP
I think since we didn't follow protocal and let the waiters order it turned into a disaster!
I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, but Mr
Chow showed me just how great it can be
We had our waiter order for us (which is the way to go if cost isn't an issue) and the food that he brought was great
The scene is a bit much some time, but the food is worth it
The bar is small and crazy, but the bartender never fails to mix a good drink
This is a good place to take a group and you may feel like you are in a scene from Indian Jones
Disappointed!!!!!The service was completely opposite in LA!!! I sat down, the waiter asked me what I would like to drink
I asked for a Shirley Temple
He looked at me like I had 2 heads
Then he asked if I would like water
It must have been 5-8 minutes before I got anything
We ordered and they forgot my rice
My girlfriend had to look for waiter to refill her glass with water (twice)! In Beverly Hills they refill your water in a matter of seconds
I decided to speak up
The matre de ignored what I said about my girlfriend having to look for a waiter to refill her glass (twice), I mentioned about my rice, he said, You should have spoken up
He took the credit card slip out of my hands and told me good night
I said, Can I have my copy? He couldn't care less
This is one of the top restaurants in the city
Food was great, service was spectacular, and the atmosphere was more than you could ask for
When here on a first date, you can not go wrong! Sit at your table and let the staff go to work, all you have to do is pick a bottle of wine and they do the rest, don't bother asking for a menu these people will take care of you, a few things that we enjoyed, soft shell crabs and chicken satay, one word of advice, bring the expense account or beware, dinner will run two bills and up for two but well worth it!
The Scene Arching palms, lazy ceiling fans, moody lighting and haunting black-and-white photos of colonial Vietnam may make you feel like putting on a white suit and riding off to the poppy plantation, or planting the seeds of revolution
It's a popular place, and at peak hours you may be dispatched to the upstairs to a caliginous tropical lounge
Throughout it all, the charming staff handles things with aplomb
The Food Over the years the cooking has lost some of its explosive zest, yet many enticing dishes remain
A signature starter, spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and mushrooms, is brittle and tasty; the "spicy" beef might not satisfy the fire-eating crowd, but it is otherwise fresh and colorful
Some of the old standbys are enticing: tender ginger-marinated duck with a tamarind dipping sauce, and grilled loin of pork paired with a terrific mango and jicama salad tinged with wasabi
For dessert, get anything with the prefix "lemon" or "lime
"
Enjoyed a nice, intimate lunch here and although it was pricey it was worth the visit
Solid vietnamese with a distinct french influence (some inconsistencies but nothing major)
Unlike earlier reviews, I had good-great service here
I would recommend the Richard Bourgeois Sancerre if you're looking for a nice, crisp white
We just started exploring our new neighborhood when we found a gem
Le Colonial
We didn't have a reservation but were greeted warmly by the maitre d' even though the restaurant was very busy
We were seated at a table which was close to the door, I asked the maitre d' if it would be possible to sit further back
He again accomodated graciously
we asked him his name (Philippe) as his manner and professionalism made us think he was the owner
Every restaurant should have someone as polite and effecient like Philippe running their dining room
We will be back often
great food but above all great service
The food was mediocre, certainly not bad, but the ambiance is worth it
Closely packed though, you'll be seated right next to your fellow diners
Really lovely dining experience
the ambiance was ok
kinda older - like 50's - i was hoping for a more authentic vietnamese place and was disappointed - other reviews are right - frenchy attitude
servers never ONCE asked how we were doing - they brought out food late and if extra additions were requested, they came out 20 min after
the food was eh
not so good
bland as it gets
id much rather go to my corner thai place than come here again (don't know any corner vietnamese place)
price was about $60 per person with 20% tip
should have only given 10%
banana desert was yummy
weird with violin softly playing downstairs and hard core techno beats coming from upstairs
After having moved away from New York it is good to be back and see that Le Colonial is still a great place to go
It was always our favorite restaurant since it's opening, so it was a surprise when we walked in on a very busy night (no reservation) and the host graciously accomodated us
He even took the time to suggest and describe some of the items on the menu
Even better was his extensive knowledge of the wine list
All I can say what a fantastic evening we spent
the food
the service and and the staff make it 4 star
Two weeks later when my husband's family came to visit
Le Colonial was the only place to go
This time we were a large party on a very busy night
and again the graciousness of the host the moment we came through the door was impressive!!!!!
My feelings are still mixed about Le Colonial
My first experience was with take-out on a weekday
My second experience changed my feelings about the establishment; on a last-minute whim I took a fashion designer and a group of editors to the restaurant
The host was INCREDIBLY rude, he had no interest in accomodating us and actually turned away from me as I tried to put my name on the list
(This is after I called before our arrival and was told I could be seated in 20 minutes)
Our party waited almost an hour before finally being seated
We ordered almost everything on the specials list and were not impressed
The food was appetizer-quality at best, nothing special
If you want to wine, dine and impress people, the rudeness and attitude at this restaurant is definitely not what you're looking for
Le Colonial is a nice chic little place with a Vietnamese theme and menu
Nice wine list
I recommend the Richard Bourgeois Sancerre
For an appetizer try the chicken raviolis, and for dinner try the beef briolle
Dinner for two with wine will probably run about $125-150
Nice atmosphere
The only thing is that if you're only two people the seating arrangements will have you practically on the laps of the other couple next to you
Upstairs is a lounge serving up drinks and food
Nice
There aren't many places in this area I'd describe as 'intimate and sexy', but this is one
Came here for a late dinner after a long day at work and took the corner table (highly recommended for the next time you're trying to seduce - don't get stuck in a middle table)
Service was perfect: attentive yet utterly unobtrusive
The roasted chicken with chili dipping sauce may not sound exciting, but it's probably the best roast chicken I've had the privilege of eating
The sticky rice was also excellent
I had low expectations of this old-timer touristy spot
But I was really surprised
The service was awesome and the food spectacular
My friend took care of the bill, so I didn't see the numbers, but it was a great experience
Try it!
Met a first date upstairs at the bar
From my limited time there, great atmosphere
I liked the palms and wicker and groovy jazz/funk background music in the bar area

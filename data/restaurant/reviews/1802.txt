The steaks were good, but nowhere near the best I've had, and they brought out our appetizers 10 min apart! I sat and waited for another person at the table to recieve her appetizer for 10 min while mine got cold, and the waiter was tottally indifferent
Steak Frites is down the street (better steak/service/value)-I suggest you try that and avoid letting Bobby Flay-your- wallet-in-half
I went during restaurant week and started with the green chili and corn chowder, which was excellent for a non-chili eater
For the entree, I had the 16 spice chicken, which was phenomenal
The wntire group enjoyed the entire meal
The only blemish was our waitress, who left us with empty drinks for quite a long time
I went for Restaurent Week 2003 had great food
16-spice chicken was excellent, as was the hominy grits
I've been there once before food was great
The negative food comments must have ordered different dish
The bill came to $146 with drinks for the $30
03 per person deal
First, the bread was OLD, HARD, and BAD
The fish I ordered was very dry and the potatoes were coated with greasy mayonaisse
Maybe if I was not paying 60 for dinner I would be okay with it, but for those prices the food should be at least decent! The portion was also on the smaller side
The chef had no creativity, I HIGHLY doubt Bobby Flay was even in NYC
The food seemed to be haphazardly plopped on
SO DISAPPOINTING
The appetizers are not special at all and pretty small
The wine list is not great
Although the hostess was nice, the waitress was horrible
Didn't see her for much of the night and she kept trying to charge us more by loading on the bottled water
The restaurant was simply terribly DISAPPOINTING!!! I won't be going back in a long time
OVERRATED! Don't believe the hype
The food wasn't great, the service was mediocre, and it was pricey
Nice combination Mr
Flay
EXCELLENT food from the appetizer all the way to dessert
Crowded tables and loud atmosphere
Went there for the 2003 Restaurant Week and was a bit disappointed
The food was fine, but certainly nothing out of the ordinary
Even for the $30 Restaurant Week price, it didn't seem like a great value
If I had paid the full price ($28 for the bland Sea Bass entree alone), I would have been rather upset
The cornbread was great, but the rolls entirely inedible
What were they thinking? Airline bread is better that that
Nice ambiance, if a bit noisy even late at night
Still, I would not go back
I am extremely annoyed by the person who answered the phone
She always starts with,'Mesa Grill, can you hold?' I called twice
First for reservation
She made me wait for 5 min
Second time, I asked for direction
Again, she asked me to hold the line
When I walked in, she was chatting with another guy and simply ignored me
I stood for a few minutes and then said,'I had a reservation!'
She finally greeted me
This happened on Tuesday 24th June 2003 whoever the receptionist was on duty should be fired
Went there for Restaurant week
Just don't order the burger! Otherwise, everything else is just okay
A very busy place that accomodates even the large tourist family
I've been to much better places during Restaurant week
Must try the watermelon dessert - has mojito sorbet with diced fruit and fruit juice
I'd buy a gallon of that sorbet!
What an amazing place
A total of 6 of us ate dinner at Mesa Grill, and every single person raved about the entire meal, from appetizer straight through to dessert
Not only was the food good, but it was creative
Kudos to the team in the kitchen
Also, very knowledgable and friendly service staff
Some suggestions
Crispy Shrimp Grilled Asparagus Taquitos - Appetizer Spice Crusted Black Angus Sirloin - Dinner Sweet Potato Tamale - Side (man was this amazing!)  Will be going back again for sure
My wife and I went to dinner at the grill expecting a culinary delight
we had a 10:00 reservation and did not get seated untill 10:45
once seated we saw our waiter twice once when he took our order and then when he came back after dinner to see if we wanted any deserts
the food was what i expected but we waited nearly an hour between our appetizer and main course at 11:30 at night when they resturant is nearly empty
Having seen his TV show I wanted to sample his fare
Disappointing
Although the presentation was colorful and interesting, the taste didn't match it
I'm beginning to think Flay just takes different vegetables, blends it, pours it over your food and calls it a sauce
The choice of sauces and chili overpowers the flavor of the entree as opposed to accentuate it
Perhaps he should focus more on his food and not his TV shows
I had family in town this past weekend and thought that Mesa Grill would be the perfect place for dinner because they love Food TV and it seemed like it would be a fun place on a Friday night
We were truly disappointed
The food was ok - definitely not worth the price
Our service was horrible - our waitress was MIA most of the night and when she was there she was trying to increase the bill in order to raise her tip
We have decided that we will no longer visit restaurants where the chefs are more interested in their new found celebrity than running a good restruant
What a great meal! Everything was great
The shrimp and goat cheese empanada was a wonderful blend of flavors and textures - highly recommend
The pork tenderloin was done to perfection - excellent quality
The desserts are amazing
We even saw Bobby Flay himself
We will definately go again and bring friends
As always reservations dont seem to do much good, waited over one hour to be sat
The bar is entertaining and the drinks are good
One helluva margarita
We sat on the balcony and it was VERY NOISY, very hard to enjoy conversation
Which was actually okay because I needed all the jaw strength I had just to cut through the sirloin
Very tough and salty, pure overkill on spices
It is very fair to say that the wine list could use a makeover
The service was overall good it was just obvious Bobby Flay was not in the building
The normally careful presentation was haphazord and the spices were overbearing in almost every dish
I had a 9pm reservation and wound up sitting down closer to 10, but the bar was entertaining enough for the almost-an-hour wait (excellent martinis)
The food was delicious; the service was a little slow, but it didn't seem TOO bad (maybe becuase of the martinis I consumed while waiting for my table)
Don't go in expecting extra-freindly, prompt service, but if you're in good company and you don't mind waiting, the food is definitely worth it
Was extremely crowded last Thursday night
Had reservations for 8:30pm but was not seated until 9:20
While there were a couple of empty tables for four they refused to seat us until a proper table for five was ready
They did attempted to appease our starving group with a complimentary appetizer and loads of bread
Though it was a rough start, the food was able to win us over a bit and put us in better moods
The spices and foods used in their dishes compliment each other yet is still distinct in flavor
Our only complaint was the poultry dish which came out dry

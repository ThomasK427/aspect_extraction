When I told the host my name, he just stared
Waitress came up to me and looked at me questioningly
I repeated the reservation name to her, the host whom I had spoken to said rudely I GOT IT
We sat down to a claustrophobic's nightmare of a table
Menu was EXTREMELY limited
Eggs any style was an option
My friend asked if she could have a style in particular, and the waiter answered, We don't DO that
He was being so unhelpful and my friend, who was almost in tears, had to ask, Well what DO you do? The host looked miserable the whole time, and was prancing around in a tizzy
Food was mediocre
Just a horrific experience
Even if the food was delicious and the menu was endless, I still would never go back
I don't really like greedy restaurants
You know the type
They shouldn't keep their patio open year-round
We shouldn't have stayed (like four other couples who left)
The waitstaff may try and convince you that the heaters are warm in winter, I assure you they are not
We tried to eat our food (the little bits that are served) quickly so as it would not get cold
I think my Dad enjoyed the hot dogs he bought on the corner after the meal more than his undercooked chicken he returned to the kitchen for more cooking, and still came back undercooked
We witnessed the waitstaff continue to try and tell people things were fine and this was business as usual and the restaurant was great--while we waited and waited for our meal
I think our cold night lasted well into two hours and we left hungry and broke
I was there 11-23-2005
Food is below average
Small portion but good presentation
The average cost for 2 people is 95 dollars included tips
If your date is not helping out with the bill, make sure to bring enough cash or have one of your credit cards handy
the food is thoughtfully prepared and brimming with flavor
the only drawback was that our waitress forgot a beverage order and when reminded failed to rush it to the table or offer her apologies
This is a beatiful little place
You have lots of choices on Cornelia street but you cant go wrong by choosing Home
We were lucky enough to have the garden seating on a beatiful evening
The wine list is good and reasonably priced
The food was interesting, delicious, and well presented
Everything was cooked and seasoned with gourmet skill
Even the salads and the soups were exceptional
We went on a Friday night at about 6pm
We did not have a reservation but were seated immediately
There is nothing about Home to rave about
The menu was not particularly interesting or varied; the service was below sub par
Although the environment is homey, I would not go back
The food was a meal I could find anywhere else in the city for a better price
Would not recommend
I left hungry
When I suggested I could eat another fish dinner, they said they would be happy to serve me another, but I would hardly do that as there were others in my party
I said this to give the staff a hint that they don't serve large enough portions
The main course too small and so was the side
The dessert was as good as the waiter said it would be
I ripped my panty hose on the bench in the garden where they seated us
I said something about it to the hostess or owner, she gave me a blank stare
I told her that I didn't expect to be reimbursed for the expensive hose, just smooth down the wood on the bench so that this doesn't happen to anyone else
She smiled blankly, she didn't care
We left the restaurant still hungry
a big no-no
Sure, it's charming and romantic with a lovely garden
But if the food is no good, the ambience doesn't matter
For $19, I would expect more than six bite-sized scallops; the asparagus was more like a garnish than an accompaniment
And if you're going to serve the trout whole, say so on the menu
Sure, they offered to fillet it, but if I had known I'd be pulling tiny bones out of my mouth the whole time, I would have ordered something else
The temperature was lukewarm, suggesting that the long wait meant our food had been sitting there a while
Overall, a pretty unpleasant dining experience
I took my parents and my girlfriend here for a casual dinner before going to the Blue Note
It definitely met our expectations
The food was excellent, traditional American dishes prepared VERY well
I've never enjoyed a porkchop so much, it was great
Definitely try the bleu cheese fondue and the onion rings with the homemade ketchup
The ambiance overall is very simple but we ate on the patio behind the restaurant which was a very nice touch
I don't think I would take someone here for a romantic dinner but it's perfect for a small group or a casual night out
My visit to Home was about three years ago, on an empty night with a small group of friends
It was fantastic; the food, service, and ambiance couldn't be beat
Based on this, I suggested we go there for a double date-type dinner last night
Bad idea! The entrees (Brook Trout, ) ranged from average to bland, although the sides and desserts were very good
The service is where the problems existed
You have to ask for everything - even water refills, and yes, the waitstaff seems put off if you aren't ordering appetizers, wine, coffee, etc
I'm going to try and forget last night
Overall, the place is too damn small and just not worth cramming yourself into
I was taken on a date to Home for dinner
I was really not impressed by this place in the least
After looking through their limited menu and finally picking things out, I was informed that they didn't have the food I wanted
It was early on a Saturday so I don't think there was any excuse
The food was overcooked and dry-  Will not return to home
I strolled into Home last week and discovered their autumn menu which was filled with great autumn produce and new specialties
I had roasted lamb with spaghetti squash and an interesting tomato goat cheese sauce, then a pear upside down cake for dessert
Superb! Our waiter was informed and helpful
The freindly prices at this place are the best kept secret in New York!
Stopped by Home after hearing about its wine list which features North Fork wine
I grew up there so was intrigued
Sat in the garden with a bottle of Jamesport Sauvignon Blanc and Blue Cheese Fondue
Wonderful
Reminds me of Paris, but without the attitude
I was very excited to get a walk-in table on a Friday evening but was soon disappointed
Our waitress was rather un-friendly, seemed annoyed that we didn't want appetizers and we waited 15 minutes before our wine arrived
The food was decent but nothing special
The tips can only be left in cash and our waitress didn't even thank us for our over-generous 20% tip
I won't rush back
Shame really, because this is a gorgeous little place
This place has a lovely outdoor backyard
The food was good for brunch but it took 20 minutes to get a MENU!! The hostess seats you and suppose to get you the menu but never comes back
Even if you ask the waiter for a menu, he'll say that the hostess will get it for you
Yes, it was busy but it was absolutely ridiculous that we couldn't get a menu for 20 minutes then waited another 20 minutes to order!!
A freind invited me for lunch at Home because he said they have the best hamburgers
He was right! Served perfectly grilled with a thick slice of white cheddar, just the rightr sized bun, homemade pickes and homemade ketchup! And the buttermilk onion rings on the side were also terrific

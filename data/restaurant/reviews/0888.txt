The ambiance is bright, floral, and warmtruly an only in New York dining experience
BYOB, and be sure to try the delectable tres leches cake before you go
This is a totally fun, quaint, different little place in the East Village that my wife I totally loved
It seats about 20 people, so we had to wait a bit
but 10mins max
It's BYOB the food couldn't be cheaper
We were stuffed for $40 (cash only btw)
There's basically one thing you should get and that's the Arepas, which are basically stuffed English muffin (yet a bit saltier) type pitas, that they stuff with 17 different fillings
I recommend the chicken avocado plain cheese one
One strike against this place is that my wife is a picky eater and they couldn't really make an Arepa to order despite saying so on the menu as most meats, etc are already premixed with the guacamole or different types of fixings
But we certainly found other things to eat
Totally fun different, highly recommend
This place is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC, and I am in the business
the food is great, atmosphere is great (though the location is too small
there is always a wait)
I have brought many friends here and everyone always loves it
I always get a reina pepiada and a de pabellon arepa
I went here based on reviews and I really enjoyed it
Its very small but (festively decorated) and got full real quick
We had the pabellon criollo which was really good
The meat was delicious and the plantains with the salty cheese was tasty
We also had the domino empanada which was so-so(I expected more flavor) but the arepas was really good mainly because of the cheese(so yummy!) To drink we had the coconut milkshake and papaya juice
The milkshake was really good; the papaya juice however tasted too much like it was from concentrate
We let the ice melt to water it down a bit
We did not even have space to try dessert, but I will definately make it a point next time
The food here is delicious! The reina pepiada, la platanera and capresa criolla stuffed arepas were ALL yummy
I had the plate of pabellon which they serve with rice and without it being in arepa which is not shown on the menu is also very good
Their drinks are also delicious and a must try is the chicha
It is a thick drink which almost taste like a cream of rice
it's delicious
The place is very very small
only 8 tables so I suggest you go early if you don't want to wait for a table
I have been to Venezula and this place is almost like you were there
This is authentic venezuelan food, it is delicious, homemade and great on price and service
Two thumbs up!!!!
Good choice for trying the most traditional food of Venezuela
The cheeses are close to the original Venezuelan ones
Good variety for the price, including empanadas and the ever loved cachapa
They make a great arepa and have cheese flown in from Miami, which is what you are there for! Get a taste of what Venezuelans can eat morning noon and night! Great take out, although they are best piping hot
(The restaurant is charmingly small, but not for those with clausterphobia)
They may seem heavy to those not used to them, but they are a great healthy meal and cheap too! You'll love them so much, you might just hop a plane down to Caracas!
The place is tiny and crowded, but the wait isn't very long cause of the type of food, fast but healthy
and once you get in it's worth it, down your 2 or 3 arepas, have a Toddy chocolate drink and some traditional Venezuelan dessert, the people are very friendly and hospitable! It's best to stop by at off hours so it won't be so full
In Short Inside this slim storefront, patrons snuggle into small tables against a brick-exposed wall, or sidle up to the gracefully curved bar, lit by chic pendant lamps
Unlike more traditional diners, breakfast--omelettes, pancakes, bacon, etc
--isn't served around the clock
The dinner menu promises creative-yet-comforting fare, such as beef brisket in a red wine and fig sauce, panko-crusted tofu over hijiki salad, and a six-spice beef burger
Desserts include New York cheesecake and an Israeli dessert called malabi
I have eaten here several times now the place never dissapoints
The staff is always personable--they're young hip with a cool aire about them
The soups are always divine and the crispy filo appetizer is phenomenal
My favorites so far? The Israeli couscous, the roasted vegetable sandwich, every soup they make (especially the tomato ginger) and the salad Nicoise
Go here to have a fun time and don't miss out on the sunday brunch!
Service was terrible
Had to ask twice for beverages ordered
Entree came with the wrong side
I thought it might just be me, but two sets of people sitting next to us had similar problems
The waitress was totally unapologetic
And please
enough with the euro-techno music played loudly at brunch
This place has lots of good options for vegetarians
It has a nice laid-back atmosphere
I've always had good service and the food is superb
I highly recommend the sandwiches and brunch
i recently had brunch at the new hill diner let me tell you it was great
the new look for hill diner is amaizing and the food is just getting better and better i had a blast of a brunch
go try it yourself!
This place has really good options for vegetarians
Not only do they put all of the veg stuff in green but there are quite a few options that are tasty at that
The panco crust tofu is dry (could use more sauce) but it is interesting
the grilled marinated tofu sand is good and so is the filo dough thing
all in all, if you are vegetarian this is a safe and promising bet! I haven't tried the bkfast but it looks good
Also, I've never had a problem with the waitstaff
The Scene As befits its Soho pedigree, the 50-seat storefront is spare and sleek, with patterned beige banquettes, ebony-trimmed white walls and black-and-white photographs of rural Greece
But the eager-to-please staff warms the place up, even if their snappy all-black uniforms can make it tricky to tell the waiters from fellow diners
The Food The kitchen likes to give Mediterranean dishes a contemporary twist: Moussaka is transformed into an airy roulade of sheer potato slices wrapped around lush sauteed eggplant
Waiters suggest eating family style, but silky, salty taramosalata (carp roe spread), fennel-punched grilled sausage topped with sweet cubes of pear compote and dreamy braised lamb are too good to share
Overall, the menu tips the balance to the sweet side, but fig lovers will be in heaven, from the sherry-fig vinaigrette drizzled over grilled summer squash to the dessert combo of wine-poached figs with pistachio-scattered fresh sheep's milk cheese
I went to Taverna on a Saturday night and while the atmosphere was cozy, I believe the food is more or less typically ok and definetely overpriced
We ordered a Greek salad (which was flavorful and large), the saganaki, and the skordalia
The saganaki was very oily because it had been deep fried but not drained well and the skordalia was completely different than what we expected--a puree of potato with a very pungent, almost spicy garlic flavor
My boyfriend ordered the lamb boureki, which came with sauteed red potatoes and onions
The boureki was soft and flavorful, as the lamb had been ground into smaller bits
I ordered the lamb souvlaki but was upset because the lamb was tough AND there was so much filling inside of the pita bread that rendered the souvlaki very heavy and slightly soggy to eat
I would probably stick to a much cheaper Greek restaurant next time for the same or better quality of food!
Excellent!! Like a few before me after reading the reviews online I wasn't sure I wanted to try Snack Taverna when my friends suggested it for a get together
Upon entering we were greeted by what seemed like the whole (very friendly) staff and promptly seated
After one piece of pita smeared with a delicious smoked eggplant dip I was hooked
The service was impecable even though the quarters are a little tight
We wanted for nothing
The lamb stifado was delicious as were the rest of our appetizers
For the main meal we shared a variety of dishes including the cod, a scallop special and roast tenderloin of pork
The rice pudding with pine nuts for dessert was phenomenal
As for the previous review
what NYC resteraunt lets you bring in your own dessert without some sort of fee?? It's a greek eatery, enjoy Greek desserts!!!
Like most reviews stated, food is great
The basics are well done and presented
Taramosalata, one of the best
No problems getting more pita
Lamb sausage, although a bit dry, tasty with the sweet pear and rosemary compote

The side dishes are large portions
Service was excelent
We stepped away to have a smoke and our food was already on the table, covered so it wouldn't get cold
You don't get that service at the outback folks
Have been to Angelo Maxie's several times because of friends that insist on going there because of it's bar scene rather than the food and service
This place is not even in the same league as NYC's top steakhouses
If you're looking for a great steak - look elsewhere
if you're just looking to hook-up this may be your place
Food, service and atmosphere were wonderful on a Saturday night
We were running late for our 7pm reservation (15 minutes) and it was not a problem getting seated right away
Baked calms were excellent and porterhouse steak for 2 was perfect for the 2 of us
Once our entire party was present, we weren't seated until 30-45 minutes after our reservation
It took two trips through the crowd around the bar to tell the host that we were on a time schedule for us to get seated
Once seated, we waited 10-20 minutes to even get water, and our glasses were still wet from the dishwasher
The waiter was incredibly rude
The food was mediocre; my filet mignon was not butterflied and was not cooked well-down throughout
It was too loud to hear the person across the table from me, at a table for four
Only the desert saved the meal, as far as I was concerned
I will NEVER go here again
I demand better service and better food from any restaurant, but especially one as highly regarded and over-priced as this place
It would also be nice to hold a conversation over dinner!
Best steakhouse in Manhattan
Better than Smith and Wollensky,Ben Benson,Sparks,Old Homestead,Mortons etc
I have eaten at all of the above and many others and AM has them beat in food and especially value
The blackend Ribeye is the best thing on the menu
Look
If your looking for the best burger stop here
When I go, I only order the burger
Lets face it
In Manhattan, being a Manhattanite you search for the best of the best
So many choices, so many places, so why waste your time on anything less than the piece de resistance of burgers
I think that Les Halles has the best Steak Au poire in town so why eat it at Angelos? But if you want the best burger you know where to go now
Went there on Friday night with 7 friends, And granted the table we got was a little cramped, but who cares when the food and service and value are this good
I love the vibe in there too, it may be a little loud for some, but if that's the case, try the midtown loc
The steaks are huge and delicious, the appetizers are top class, especially the rawbar, and the service is impeccable
The cigars are a little overpriced, but the cigar bar and convenience makes it well worth it
take your friends here!
While the restaurant may at times be loud and noisy, and filled with banker types who just want to indulge into a big juicy steak after work
This steak joint has simply got the best burgers
Its a shame that most people eat the steak at this joint instead of trying the burgers
For $12
50 one can enjoy a freshly grounded burger made from the same meat that the restaurant uses for their steak
This is a big burger, a full ten ounces and it is simply the best I have ever had
Trust me, you must try this burger, I went to DB for lunch today and the burger was enjoyable and quite different but it was not a real burger
This place serves a real burger for a great deal
THe Pre-fix lunch was well worth the price
The steak was great, and I just loved the steak sauce, not to mention the cute waiters and they are so nice! I would totally recommend to friends
The steak tastes like rubber
the lamb chops are overcooked to the max!!! and flat out, the food just sux, for this claiming such praise
i dont think so
The steak was decent (I've had better) and a bit overpriced
The fries were amazing
Atmosphere is nice
I've had lunch there in the middle of the week it was very crowded and noisy, but the tables are spaced properly so it was okay
Teresa's is a quality restaurant with some ambiance
It's greatest feature is value
My date and I had entrees, soup, and appetizers (fresh spinach pierogies) for $33 - ($40 with the tip)
This is a relief to your wallet when you're paying $100 per ticket for a broadway show
For those who think you always have to pay a lot when you're in New York, it contradicts that nicely
Everything was fresh and the spices are subtle
It feels authentic; I think it was filled with native New Yorkers, not a tourist place
Low-lit incandescent lighting with some nice art on the walls
Enjoy
A friend and I went to chow on some Polish fare, however, it turned out to be the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in New York
The waitstaff was unfriendly and down right rude
We waited 20 minutes for menus and water and when the food finally came, the meat in the stuffed cabbage was pink, cold, and not cooked
When we asked the server to take it back, she did not apoligize, but walked away in a huff
Who would ever eat here is beyond me
New York it full of great resturants
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM
This place is a good example of Polish cuisine
I ate there by myself and a few other people were dining alone also
My grandparents came from Poland and the Polish Platter was like the food my relatives make at home - only better than I remember it! It's an inexpensive, comfortable place
The Scene This comfy East Village hangout, packed with earthy urban types and tattooed students, is a destination for anyone who prefers their food green, fresh and meat-free
Waits for tables in the cheery dining room can be long, but the friendly staff are accommodating no matter how busy they are
The Food Hyper creative vegetarian and vegan cooking is the menu's main draw
The popular tofu pie, which is baked in a spelt biscuit crust and garnished with radishes, is excellent
Other strong choices include nutty and sweet walnut-lentil pate and the "dragon bowl," comprised of steamed sea vegetables, rice, beans and tofu
Side orders like seaweed, collard greens, bok choy, zucchini, green beans, yellow squash and carrots are all strong, as are sandwiches--try the baked tofu, layered with roasted vegetable and pesto, on mixed grain bread
The vegan desserts are uncompromisingly good
GREAT vegan restaurant! The most expensive item on the menu is $16 and this is for the daily specials
Most items range between $6-$10, which is EXTREMELY reasonable for NYC
This place is designed for vegans and those that appreciate vegan food and a healthy lifestyle
(So those who thought the food was bland probably were just craving something deep fried and covered in salt and oil
) The daily specials and desserts are the best thing on the menu
You will definitely find something you like here but it may take some serious hunting through the many options in the menu
The staff is extremely helpful and knowlegable in this sense
Sometimes yes, the wait is long, but it's worth it
Remember to bring cash (they dont take credit cards and for a VERY good reason) and an open mind
You'll leave happy, and with money leftover
take them to Angelica's and ask them what's missing! Their answer will invariably be, absolutely nothing
This place is an institution for a reason
namely, the freshest, tastiest, most guilt-free menu on the planet
A little pricier than most veggie restaurants, but worth it if only for the dessert menu (as a wheat-sensitive, diabetic vegan, there aren't too many places I can even LOOK at desserts, and this may be the only one where I can actually EAT what they serve me
AND ask for seconds!) Favourite post-workout protein load - the three-bean chili
Angelica's Wee Dragon Bargain dish is a big, delicious, healthy meal that I HAVE to have every so often! Service here has always been friendly
This is one of my favorite veggie restaurants in the city; I've been coming here for years
I strongly recommend the Angelica cornbread (the dense, wheatless kind) with tahini spread
Yum!
There needs to be more healty food options in the city

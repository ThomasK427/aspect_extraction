So, If you could eat the steak in a bubble, now
Oh yeah, don't forget a fat wallet, it ain't cheap
The Scene The formality and politeness begins as the gold doors sweep open and well-trained staff whisk diners to the table, drink cart trailing behind--and ends with a pastry for the next morning
In between, New York's elite stoically revel in a series of stately rooms that benefit from dark, soothing wood, gold accents and jazz-inspired paintings
The Food  Chef Tony Esnault continues the Ducasse tradition of suspending uncompromising ingredients in a delicate flavor balance
The foie gras terrine imparts a silkiness befitting fine wine, and scallops tang with caviar
It'd be hard to conjure up a more flavorful, evenly cooked rack of lamb, but creamy quinoa almost gets lost in the equation
Dishes are plated with unrelenting preciseness--lobster arrives with meticulously arranged sticks of mango, palm and squash, and in a whim of obfuscation, the medley of turbot, clams and crab disappears under shellfish foam
The kitchen shows off with desserts like the signature chocolate hedgehog
Tried Ducasse for the first time the other week
wow
Yes we blew a fortune
But I thought the food was to die for; it was traditional French with some interesting twists
The desserts were incredible
The wine list is a bit over the top but has some really interesting wines by the glass
I did not find the service pushy at all-quite the opposite
Everyone from the hostess to waiter to sommelier was very nice and super knowledgeable
Great place to impress a date, (make sure he/she is a keeper first, though)
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70
00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare
If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance
This is undoubtedly the best French restaurant in the city, if your price range is upscale
The service is impeccable, the food is excellent
I had a venison dish which combined Adirondack cuisine with French
The bread is freshly baked, Champagne flows like water
Every plate is changed with each course
You are made to feel special in this place, the staff don't miss a beat
You will be spoiled rotten once you try this one
Every other French restaurant in the city, even upscale ones will pale in comparison
Highly recommended
The only thing they can improve on is getting a better location like midtown on Madison or Fifth Avenue and getting a private entrance
Do not attend with a lerge group
We were having fun and got a bit loud with laughter and were getting looks from smaller groups
Extremely over priced but excellent service
Excellent for special occaisions where price is no limit and you have LOTS of time
Our dinner was about 4 hrs long
We went to Per Se (on Columbus circle) the following day for brunch and had an excellent time, including fun
Per Se staff was much friendlier
Oh, this was also high priced but well worth every cent
My husband took me to Alain Ducasse for my birthday this past December
We had the four course, $165 prix fixe dinner, 2 glasses of wine and a glass of champagne
While each dish was interesting, the portions, believe it or not, were too large
At most French restaurants, you have a series of tastings, these were whole meals
Second, the restaurant was full of stodgy corporate clients
Lastly, there wasn't anything memorable about each dish, other than the impeccable service
Our biggest suprise was the bill, $560
We highly recommend that on the same budget, you fly to Boston and eat the $150 prix fixe dinner at L'Espalier (more intimate French restaurant)
(that 5 course meal includes a glass of wine with each course)L'Espalier was much more memorable, Alain Ducasse made me feel robbed
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime
and there's no way out
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience
The food sublime for the most part
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence! Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent
I ate there with my 2 sisters and a friend, the bill was almost $3000, but believe me it was worth every single penny! I am French and I really felt like home!!! I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!
I had a great overall dining experience--food was delicious, service was attentive, and atmosphere felt as if I was in Paris
For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks)
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining
Everything about this restaurant was special
The service was attentive, yet discreet
The flavors robust and subtle
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
I'm saving up for my next visit
air conditioner was not working, the waiter kept promising us that they had lowered the tempeture but it was all a lied, the AC was not working at all!!!! the first and cheese courses were the best, the rest was very non creative
I just visited Alain Ducasse today for lunch and I must say I was very impressed! If you enjoy upscale French dining you'll love it here- it reminded me of my wonderful dinner at the Ritz in Paris
Yes, you should be prepared to pay a lot, but I'm wondering who exactly these people are that were so shocked by the bill and all the extra charges
The menu clearly states what is included in each meal selection
The service was excellent- attentive and friendly without being pushy
Two members of my party ordered the prix fixe lunch and enjoyed it very much (one reviewer complained that it was nonexistant- odd since each table had the prix fixe menu set on it in a little frame)
I say GO! All in all it was wonderful- I think some people just like to complain
adny is a very nice restaurant but too expensive
the food was well prepared and presented
the ravioli and maine lobster dish were memorable
the nice thing about adny is that they give some things for free, like puffs, sorbet, chocolates, candies in addition to the 3 course menu-dessert
but when the waiters roll up with their champagne and cheese carts they offer them as if they are part of dinner
when in truth they are extras
one glass of champagne cost 36 dollars
the restaurant has a stuffy interior that isn't welcoming
the staff however was very nice
3 glasses of wine with each course cost 90 bucks! the staff gave a cashmere shawl for my date who was cold then again if you are spending 700 dollars dinner for 2, the staff and food better be nice
The Scene Co-owner Jennifer Scism once helped oversee the front of the house at Chanterelle, and that restaurant's spirit of elegance is clearly a source of inspiration
The airy, minimally-adorned room features buttercream walls and wood floors
The folds of a large white curtain run along one wall
Pools of soft white light created by the flicker of small candles abound
The Food An idiosyncratic, occasionally freewheeling style of intelligent New American haute cuisine is on offer
Chef Anita Lo can make the volume of her flavors go from a delicate purr to a scabrous growl on a dime, often within the span of a single dish
An assertively-seasoned lamb tenderloin, for example, finds its foil in cooling yogurt and cucumber, while wafer-thin sheets of raw tuna juxtapose the oniony pang of pink radishes
Came in for a meal with very high expectations as I had heard so many wonderful complements
Being a foodie, I ordered the tasting menu and was wowed by the presentation -- simply gorgeous
The food however, is a different story
There was great inconsistency in the juxtaposition of flavors and I left rather disappointed
Maybe it was just an off night for them and I'd be willing to give it another try
My husband took me here for an evening out (I'd never even heard of this place before), and everything was absolutely perfect
The service was amazing, the food was incredible (I got the skate on tofu with caviar and I didn't want it to end), and the ambiance was simple and elegant

The grill turns out a thick sirloin steak full of flavor; a light and juicy trout butterflied and rubbed with herbs and a magnificently crispy skin; tender and succulent baby back ribs with a mild barbecue sauce; and a few other entree options
Non-grilled items--namely the appetizers--are less appealing: limp green salad, overly sweet gazpacho, pedestrian crostini
Desserts, though they come from elsewhere, are enjoyable and refreshing
It is tricky to find this place, but it is well worth the search
It sits in central park at 69th street not far from tavern
All the food is grilled near your table
I had the Ribs and I thought they were the best I've had since I left North Carolina
My wifes trout was the best grilled fish I've had anywhere
The cook really knows his stuff, and I ask you where else can you have a backyard barbeque with a place as nice as Central Park as your backyard? The prices are reasonable and the quality is incredible
Do your self a favor and find this place now while it is still relatively unknown
You will love it guaranteed
fresh ingredients grilled right before your eyes make for a delightful meal
beautiful surroundings

you'll forget you're in the middle of NYC
Friendly staff, relaxing atmosphere, delicious food


what more could you ask for?
Given the lovely location, the outdoor hardwood grill, and moderate prices, one might expect at least the kind of simply-prepared, but fresh and vibrant dishes that a careful, modest home cook might prepare: moist chicken with crisp brown skin, top-quality ingredients, etc
Unfortunately, the SheepMeadow Cafe does not deliver
The chicken is hideously salty and obviously cooked prior to being reheated on the grill, the salad leaves are brown around the edges and doused in poor-quality oil
Even the bread and butter are terrible
How about some loaves from Balthazar or Tom Cat, guys? Why is the butter filled with chives? If they clean up their act, this place would be lovely, but it is quite a disappointment in its present state
The Scene Exposed brick, beamed ceilings, linen napkins and tapered candles make it obvious that this is a restaurant for romance
Servers swing from being attentive to patrons to being chatty with each other and stranding tables
Despite the small dining room, diners are not rushed
The Food The Spanish menu is based on the premise that quality ingredients taste best when left to shine on their own
Simple dishes, like tender, thinly sliced octopus seasoned and drizzled with fruity olive oil and tagliatelle with sauteed wild mushrooms and fresh peas, are a study in understated richness
Keeping with the romantic theme, the satisfying house paella--a wealth of mussels, prawns and clams resting on fragrant al dente rice--is served for two
Meat lovers should opt for the nicely charred, expertly cooked steak
The cheese selection is fine, though a bit pedestrian, while the duo of desserts changes daily
Thinking my first visit must have been a fluke, I went there again the other night only to confirm my initial impression: the food at AOC is mediocre and overpriced
In that neighborhood, you could eat for twice as less and four times as good
The service and ambiance are nice, but that's little compensation for a bland and over-priced meal
A quaint little spot (I counted just 34 seats)
Sunday night was busy but the service was attentive
The eggplant appetizer, and beet salad were delectable
The duck and crepes were also delicious
A beautiful little out of the way place
My girlfriend and I had a reservation for 9:30
We were Seated at 10:50
At 9:45 we politely asked how much longer it would be and were told definitely no more than 10 minutes
TOPS
Over an HOUR later were still sitting at the bar, famished and frustrated
We were not offered bread and the host did not apologize until we asked for another update 45 minutes later
To add insult to injury, when two couples tables finally opened up, the host told us a group of four was arriving soon so they were going to combine the tables for that group rather than give one of the tables to us
It was one of the most unprofessional and unclassy moves I have even seen in a NY restaurant (and I am a born and raised Manhattanite)
when most other patrons are complimentary
Perhaps I chose the wrong place, not fully appreciating that another reviewer's remark that diners here won't be rushed could translate to my timely-arrived party having to wait 'til 9:50PM to be seated for a 9PM Saturday reservation
Patrons at the table the host designated for us sat chatting OVER COFFEE that ENTIRE TIME
While apologies were twice extended we eventually were seated elsewhere, there was no mention of a complimentary cocktail/wine -- then service wasn't particularly careful to make up for our long, cold wait at the front door
We had to ask for bread water, there was no check-in, at meal-end no inquiry was forthcoming on our desire for coffee/dessert
Also, my lamb was barely lukewarm upon arrival
Although they did ultimately comp us our first cocktails, this would've had better impact if mentioned earlier
In the delicious food, the warmth radiatiing off the exposed brick and red walls and the welcoming wait staff, our experience at A

Bedford was a brilliant escape from the frosty New York evening outside
We started with the super-dooper octopus and the duck pate and then shared a pretty damn good piece of suckling pig between the two of us, followed by a wonderful dessert wine sampler and the crepe suzette
the freshly-cooked pig is brought out in all its succulent, juicy glory and divided before you, while the crepe suzette is created at the table (with minimum fuss) so that the air is filled with the honeyed smell of cooking butter and oranges
YUM!
magnificent
The service was not doting, efficient
maitre d and waitress were french and the menu looked european, not spanish
The food was divine
Fresh, artistically presented and simply prepared
Lamb chops were succulent and well seasoned
The waiter took the time to make sure he had our orders for how we wanted the meat cooked carefully
We started with the beet salad, shrimp and eggplant -- excellent
Quality over quantity and you don't leave hungry
Don't go here if you eat at the Olive Garden or Red Lobster
We were not rushed at all, and the manager comped drinks at the bar so that we would vacate our table for a birthday girl who had to wait
He asked very very nicely
It was warm in the back of the restaurant
The manager brought over a little fan and placed it right at our table! a gem!
I went to AOC Bedford two month ago in a monday night for their special BYOW every sunday monday
I really enjoy Aoc cause it's my only way to have great food and bring my own wine
I really had a great dinner, I recomend the roasted duck cooked perfectly, the selection of cheese was unbelievable
And to finish, I loved the deserts prepared in the table side, the crepe suzette flambee is my favorite
The service was very attentive
And big surprise, AOC Bedford is BYOW all summer long
My boyfriend just picked the restuarant for this past weekend, and I was so impressed
I've been to so many restaurants in the city, but this place far surpassed a lot of my experiences
I would definitely recommend the paella
The service was excellent and very attentive and the space was intimate and cozy
Everyone else around us seemed to be very happy with the food
Dining here was possibly the worst experience I have had at a NY restaurant
The waitstaff are actually aggressive towards you and the food is expensive
You get better service from the DMV than from the waiters here
There are so many good restaurants in the West Village that there is absolutely no reason to waste your time on this one
Excellent service; excellent food
Excellent for an intimate dinner
Not great for large groups, though
The prixe fixe (5
30 - 7
00) is a an excellent bargain
What a perfect little restaurant on a perfect little street in the most exciting city in the world
Our party of 8 arrived @ 20 minutes late ( we called) to a hearty handshake from the Maitre' d and we new all would be superb
Everything from the quaint side street to the warm glow of candles reflecting off the brick walls, makes you feel as though you have found some secret locals spot in Paris

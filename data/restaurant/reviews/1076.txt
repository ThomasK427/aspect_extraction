Needless to say, I found this super annoying and unbelievably unprofessional
Leaving customer's in a lurch is not good business policy, especially since there are other great wood oven pizza joints down the corner on 5th Ave
The food is very good and service is too
If you're a party of 2 the tables are quite cramped
But bottom line it is just too expensive
If you want to try it have a pizza and a beer at the bar, with tax and tip it'll be about $25
This place is great
The appetizers are unusual for a pizza joint, the pizza's are incredibly light (if not a touch burnt from time to time) and tasty
The fact that the ingredients are of high, if not organic, very natural and local quality is a real boon
The bartender (cute bald guy) can mix a drink and knows his stuff (rare to find Cynar outside of my Nonna's house)
Yes, the waitstaff can be a little perky but I've been here serveral times and have yet to be disappointed
The price for what you get
the quality ingredients make it worth while
Those who posted bland
consider quitting smoking or salting your food to death
Subtle and flavourful are symbiotic in the culinary world
Well it started off wrong when the bartender didn't know that Maker's Mark was bourbon
When I asked her to add a bit to my very weak drink she refused
I just don't get this place
Well over $100 bucks for pizza! Granted a few cocktails were thrown in, and an app, but come on
The cauliflower app was mostly bread
The other one was so memorable I can't remember what it was
My wife's clam pie was excellent, but my anchovie pie could have been had at any one of the dozen other pizza places within walking distance
If your looking to have a great meal walk over to 5th ave and take your pick but bypass this joint
First of all, I can't believe that there are people out there that get upset when they have to cut their own pizza
I've been to Franny's several times, and have never had an issue with this fact
The crust is perfectly light and crisp, and they give you a knife
Also, when a cocktail is made correctly, it shouldn't taste like it has alcohol in it
Sadly, many people feel the need to berate their server for a stronger drink
Thirdly, and most importantly, the pizzas here are unlike anything you could ever have in walking distance
The flour in the crust is from Vermont, the sauce from San Marzanos, the cheese from Brooklyn, and the anchovies the best you could ever hope for
If you don't actually know how to recognize quality and passion for REAL cuisine, then don't poste on here
First the good, the pies are tasty
The bad- they come not sliced (they will not cut the pizza no matter how you ask), on a plate that is too small and curved and they arm you with knives that are duller than Grampa's slide show
I understand if the look they are going for includes an unsliced pie, but if requested they should slice it for me or give me some tools that are up to the challenge
I was told that the kitchen doesn't even have a cutter! I work in a kitchen and I feel certain that they have a knife or two lying around as well as a cutting board
The service is pushy
I do like the pizza's there, they are over priced, but good
I am, as you can tell, annoyed by the place
I doubt that I will return
While the individual pizzas where good (nothing special) the prices were outrageous
Dinner for me and my wife (2 pizzas, 2 glasses of wine and 1 dessert was $100 bucks!)
The servers are constantly in your face asking if you want another drink (mine was half full)
There are several other places in Brooklyn to fine comparable if not better pizza, at reasonable prices and without the hassle or attitude
My girlfriend and I agree that this is the best pizza in Brooklyn
The ingredients are of extremely high quality, the service is well informed, prompt, but not pushy
Definitely try some of the more unusual combinations on the pizza and take advantage of the special appetizers
Its different from what you may be used to, but go for it---you won't be disappointed
Do yourself a favor and order the house-cured fennel sausage
If they have the fried zucchini, get that too! Both are magnificent
The fontina and egg pizza was interesting, but I probably wouldn't order it again
Contrary to the previous poster's experience, we didn't find the waitstaff too pushy at all
In fact, they were wonderful and quite professional
At around $15 a pie (which serves one), this isn't cheap pizza, but it's high quality
The garden seating area in the back is beautiful and serene, but sadly, you can't order food there
You can only get drinks and dessert
Overall, Franny's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood
was very excited about new place in the neighborhood, but we don't need more like this
the pizza, while fresh, was completely bland and the crust was also not memorable
waitstaff is way too in your face and its pretty darn pricey
create a better, zesty sauce, calm the waiters, and it may get better
The Sugar Sanp Pea appetiser was phenomenal! The Spinach and Ricotta gnocci was literally the best gnocci I had ever eaten by a large margin
I cannot say enough about my new neighborhood favorite
Perhaps the waitstaff is a bit overzealous, but that's better than inattentive I suppose
A glass of wine for each of us (decent), shared appetizer (snow peas, excellent), individual pizzas (just ok, and really, less filling than two slices at your local slice joint, not *nearly* as good as John's or Totonno's), a shared dessert (good but rather small), and the bill
over 70 bucks! Just not worth it
I guess you need to remind yourself that you're paying for very local ingredients
Service was quite attentive, though our server over-enthusiastically detailed/footnoted more than half the items on the menu
Friendly, but a little too in-your-face
Went here on a Friday night with a couple friends
The wait (no reservations) was an hour, but we didn't mind since we got a bottle of wine, but did mine since they were understaffed and only half the tables were full
When we were seated, service was spotty and slow, but helpful when it came to recommendations
The pizzas were good (Artichoke, Mussel), which took a while as well, and was better than most in Park Slope but not worth more than a trip from the neighborhood
If the service picks up, it could be a very good restaurant
Hands down the worst pizza we've eaten in a LONG time, waited really LONG for it too, almost an hour without even an apology or a comped beer, just excuses like 'we had a large table' before yours
Too bad, because now none of our friends will be going there
There is no basil to be found in the place, so the tomato/mozzarella (if that's what you call it) is BORING
The pancetta on the fontina and onion pie is sliced so thick it's like chewing on hunks of tough fat
Two skimpy artichokes sliced in half, 'not in the style of the jewish ghetto' (they don't greasily batter dip them in Rome's ghetto) are way overpriced
Sure the ingredients are organic, kudos, but they should find a chef who know how to use them
After we left we headed striaght to another pizzeria and had a great, satisfying meal
The food here is perfectly fine, but very tiny portions for the price
The bigger sin is the service --our waiter was late with our main dishes, late with the bill, which was totaled incorrectly (twice)
Worst of all is the manager, who should have been attentive (after we had to ask her about where are order went), and should have at least comped us something for our trouble
Pizza shouldn't be such an ordeal
I've been to Franny's thrice since they last month, and I'll be back again soon
The first time I went with 5 other people
Comfortable, but it may be tight with a much larger group
They were very accomodating and would probably figure something out
We ordered 6 different pizzas and split them all
Delicious! Great wine selection, too
Very cozy atmosphere, so it was perfect when I went back with my girlfriend
If you don't like wine, try a Southampton beer (on tap!)
According to the menu, they use all-natural ingredients whenever possible
Sure tasted fresh to me
A personal pizza is just a bit much for one person, but I doubt youll complain
great for sharing
The place is always hopping, but I have not had to wait long for a table
I do hope they expand their menu or add specials, for people who frequent their place
Hate to have to echo comments about the poor service when the food was so good, but it was the case for us

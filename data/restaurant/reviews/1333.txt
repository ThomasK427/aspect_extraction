Make sure to sit inside, you get the feel of being in Mexico
The wood work is unbelievable
I was told to try this place out because of the excellent tacos
Well, I was not disappointed, to say the least
After three orders of tacos, I was asking for more! Each plate was tastier than the previous
Our last plate, which was shrimp I believe, came with a garlic mojo sauce that was out of this world
Combine this exquisite cuisine with excellent, service and the best margaritas I've had in a while, and well you have a gem of a resturant in the heart of the West Village
Bravo Mercadito!
Ooops
I won't make that mistake again
Our evening started off wonderfully at Mercadito Grove, until it started
The waiter LOUDLY specialled the table next to ours, then looked at us and said you get all that? Are you kidding? For the rest of the meal I felt like we were waited on more by the busboys than by my waiter - and at least their service was attentive
The food was less than impressive and extremely overpriced
Chez prices - Hamburger Service
My friends and I went here on a Thursday
Everything was fine (though the margarita's are super small) until we had to wait over an hour for dinner to arrive - and watch every table around us get served while we were completely ignored
Whe it finally did arrive, the food was bland and definitely not worth the price
Besides, do you really want to sit outside on 7th Ave
South?? Not exactly the most relaxing atmosphere
We were here on a Sunday afternoon (the only patrons), they ran out of Corona, the food was average and the waiters were not on top of things
There are so many great places to eat in the city - don't waste your time or money!
I joined CitySearch just to write this review - the service at this establishment is simply the pits
There were about 15 waiters/servers in the restaurant and yet they couldn't seem to get it together
Our margaritas came after 1/2 an hour - and they didn't ever ask if we wanted more - the server brought all our food to the wrong table - my dinner came after my boyfriend had finished his plate and they ran out of a certain dish at 9PM on a Friday!! The food was good (albeit, very small portions) but I would NEVER go back
STAY AWAY!!!
We had a fantastic grilled chicken appetizer, assembled as a hefty pyramid garnished with fried lotus root
That was a lovely creation (tho the mashed potatoes that bedded it were clearly from a mix) and the height--literally and figuratively--of the meal
The Japanese red snapper was quite good the night we went, but the hamachi and kanpachi were a disappointment and the spicy tuna rolls used something that tasted more like Hellman's than Japanese mayo
To be fair, we went right as they were closing on a Monday night
Attractive space and pretty nice service
They were apologetic about hurrying us to order, which annoys me--I'd rather restaurants not sit us at all), but aside from that, servers were quite nice and friendly
I'd give this place another shot just to see if I can find something as good as our appetizer somewhere else on the menu and whether they fare better on a good night of the week for sushi
I may end up staking this place out more as a great place for tapas than for sushi
The restaurant just re-opened two days ago and I'm glad they did
The quality of the sushi was excellent, just melted in your mouth
The menu offers many great dishes at reasonable prices
The staff was very helpful and courteous
The ambience and decor is very welcoming and pleasing with great background music
It's worth the visit
Not-so-big dining room, but they'd have big policy on their dishes
Lovely Sushi with their original toppings, lobster dish, tile fish dish
and mouthwatering soy panna cotta!!!   Great place for couples
My friend and I went there on 7/24 which was a Monday night
We came with our own bottle of wine and enjoyed a nice meal
We ordered the mushroom ravioly which was fantastic and sushi rolls - spicy tuna, spider roll and some other one - which were ok at best
The place itself is very cozy with great ambiance and full of very interesting people
Service was very good
My friend and I enjoyed ourselves so much that we promised that we'll come back
next time, however, we will not be ordering sushi
What a great place
Paris Match reminded us Balthazar with better food
The place is very cosy, the ambiance fantastic (very MAdison) and the service freindly
Who are they kidding? The Belgian waffles were EGGO waffles!!! They served frozen waffles, and just microwaved it! Are they kidding? Thankfully we had the sweetest waitress and she took care of everything, and we were quickly given another meal
Also, I know it was a busy brunch but it seemed like every table around me had something going wrong! Maybe the kitchen couldn't handle how busy it was
I'll try again for dinner
but NEVER FOR BRUNCH!!!
Paris Match is our favorite restaurant in New York
The menu is great and offers a lot of choice with sushi and bistro fares
The service is friendly and efficient
As for the ambience no loud music but lot of celebrities sightings
I recommend this fabulous French Bistro, for the menu, the decor, the service
really enjoy all of it!!!
Great eggs and excellent French Toast
Lay back atmosphere
and no attitude
will be back
Great food, atmosphere, location, vibe, decor, and service
The sushi is pricey, the bistro food is not
Great place to go with friends on any occassions
Saw Ivana Trump having dinner but Paris MAtch is low-key anyway which is good
The hanger steak ($18
95) is a steal, extremely well prepared, the sushis are fresh and the rolls are very creative with great sauces
Paris Match was a great choice for my date and myself as we both wanted different things that night
Atmosphere was a bit loud but other than that an enjoyable meal
Paris Match is a quintessential restaurant--great for brunch and amazing for dinner
The eggs benedict are wonderful, as well as the mini-doughnuts
I also went for dinner and had the best juicy and tasty burger I have ever had
The fries are exceptional
Great selection of beers
I live a couple blocks from Paris Match and it's the prefect addition that everyones needed
A cool spot different from the snobs la goulue, nello, le bilboquet and amaranth
Paris Match has a huge menu consisting of bistro and sushi at reasonnable prices, a fun atmosphere and very cute waitresses and bartenders
The owner also own 212 down the street which is also a cool spot
My group of 4 at the last minute turned to 5 and we were running late
Knowing that it's always hard to get a reservation in happening new places I immediately called the manager to let the staff know of my situation
He was very friendly and accommodating
As soon as we arrived, we were seated, greeted with exceptional customer service and ate an amazing dinner
All restaurants should follow their lead
Great Place  I took my girlfriend here for my birthday and we had a great time
Sushi was great and so was the service
The Paris Match Roll and Lobster Tempura are awesome
I would definetly recommend this place for a date
Price was not too bad, especially for a restaurant of this level on Madison Avenue
We ve been going to Paris Match since the opening and their food is really consistent
Great steak, chicken and fish
The sushi is the freshest around
Great desserts as well
THIS SPOT HAS GREAT SUSHI AS WELL AS GREAT ROLLS
GREAT ATMOSPHERE AND PRETTY GOOD SERVICE
Paris Match is cool especially if you like sushi

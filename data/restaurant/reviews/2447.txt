My boyfriend and I have been going for years
It's romantic and the food is great
The cumin chicken is one of my favorites
Not for those looking for a gyro off the spit
Definitely for those looking to eat some reasonably authentic greek
The lamb was wonderful, the ambiance is charming, and the service was fabulous (of course, that could be because I was a 20-something woman dining alone and they felt bad for me
) A nice casual date place or dinner with a small group of close friends
Most definitely will return
I live in the neighborhood and love this place - consistently good food, nice atmosphere reasonable prices
Have been here with lots of friends everyone has always enjoyed it
One of the few nice restaurants in the neighborhood that's not overpriced
And so close to Lincoln Center!
Forget about the other reviews
Great service and food and some of the best homemade bread I have ever had!
The Unknown Critic stopped in here and had dinner
What can I say? Its a sit-down Greek dinner, its not your rotating meat on a stick joint, and its better food than your local diner
What else did you want people? Roasted goat on a spit? Just drop in and have a nice dinner and stop your whining - just eat
The Utopia burger has to be one of the best in NYC
Huge, smothered in bacon, cheese, ham, etc
fantastic
Otherwise, the place offers standard diner fare, at a reasonable price
The Scene Two decades have made the yellowed walls with that tobacco-stained feel, red banquettes, art deco lighting, tiled and mirrored columns, and bamboo chairs feel even more authentic
A sophisticated 30-50 year-old set of celebs, homesick Euros, politicians and loyal locals bask in the blend of Manhattan glamour and Parisian bistro food
The Food Dishes that might seem pass on paper become brand-new once on the palate
Just when you thought you were tartar-ed out, fresh salmon chunks sitting on hot-chili marinated cucumbers bring a kimchee-like zing to the clean flavor of the fish
A terrific saffron aioli doesn't dare mask the freshness of crunchy, cornmeal-crusted oysters and though everyone touts the steak frites, the rosy, tender hangar steak deserves equal accolades for its unforgettably robust red wine sauce
Desserts, like the creamy mango pudding paired with fresh raspberries, affirm just why everybody loves Lux
Being a former employee of the Odeon in Tribeca, I had a free meal ticket to spend here
I took my boyfriend for a dinner, and it was great
I was not surprised to see the same Odeon layout of dinnerware, bread and butter, and the menu was somewhat similar but not such a grand dining room
We ordered the somewhat average steak tartare and proceded for entrees with the skate in muscle broth (a great choice if u love muscles) and lamb
I can't remember every detail but it was a great dinner
Wine was reasonably priced (somewhat
I remember that the Veuve Yellow Label was about $120 and I work in a well-known restaurant in Meatpacking where it is $90
) We had a great cheese plate for dessert and then went to the movies
I want to say that our service was amazing (wish I had gotten his name, but it was several fridays ago at the end of june), and we enjoyed ourselves greatly and left quickly
Great spot- fun casual bar scene- great food- great service- great atmoshpere
Get anything with the pate! Beats next door neighbor Compass by leaps and bounds
Whenever we are not sure where to eat, we always go to Cafe Lux because of their consistent food
While the service may vary, the fish, the chicken and the bistro fare is pretty good
While the onion soup is delicious, it would be nice to see the gruyere cheese oozing everywhere and bubbling over
Cafe Lux is on the pricey side, but it's a wonderful neighborhood restaurant
Crazy, frenetic pace which adds to the people watching
As for the food, it is way too rich/greasy, whether it was the calamari or grilled chicken
It is incredibly popular and hard to get in no matter what time of day/night - I think it is a testiment to it becoming an institution with a very loyal upper West Side fan base
Our favorite place we tried in NYC
The food was absolutely delicious and the service exceptional! A very neighborhoody feel!
18 years on, the Upper West Side's Cafe Luxembourg still packs 'em in every night--and not only because they're one of the few viable dining choices in the nabe
The food is consistently good (sometimes great), the pricing is decent, the service is reliable, and the scene is classy, mature and comfortably hip (no overbearing Gwen Stefani lookalikes here)
The menu sticks to bistro classics--French onion soup, frisee salad, steak frites, roasted chicken--and throws in a few homey surprises along the way; their wintertime braised oxtail entree with spaetzle is worth a trip uptown
You might even play spot the celeb; I've seen everyone from Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters to TV's Caroline Rhea happily basking in the savory food and flattering lighting
What a great place! Everyone seems to know one another
The staff made me feel a part of the place immediately
The food was exceptional
desserts very special
There's an insane scene at the suit-and-stiletto-packed bar, but if you can slide past and get a table (and bear with the occasional inadvertent jostle from the crowd) the food and the service are worth it -- as is the scene, viewed at a comfortable, non-claustrophobic distance
Imagine being IN a New Yorker cartoon
The Lady Friend had the audacity to show up looking a tad shoddy
Luckily City Grill is laidback so no one noticed or cared
(Full disclosure: I had a small hole in my pants
) We were seated immediately, and Leah came over shortly with menus and a wonderful disposition
We took our time in ordering and were not rushed
When the food did come, L(B)F shoveled down her chicken pot pie like an emaciated lumberjack
Her comment about the ccp was that it was ok
I had the lasagna which was also just ok
Though we agreed that both meals were average, I imagine that everything would be dependable in the long run as the menu has a wide variety of choices
There are better spots in the neighborhood but this is safe for someone who's looking for an unpretentious atmosphere and a lot of peas in their pie
I was pretty apprehensive about going to the City Grill after having read previous reviews traching its service
however, clearly the managment has taken these comments to heart
I was very satisfied with the food, service, and prices
Huge portions and consistently good
Can get busy on the weekends for brunch
A bar and restaurant with positive energy which is only drowned out by the staff's negative energy and poor treatment of customers
City Grill's bartenders, and even staff, forgot that they are in the service industry and are the servers
The staff needs to leave their attitude and negative imposition at home
Is it too much these days to hope to see a server with a very very little smile? I'm not even asking for minimal communication skills because this place is too far from getting it
You feel like you're there to serve them and you even get to pay them a tip to do so
What a deal
Oh yeah, and the food, it's inconsistent in quality and often overcooked
Nothing like chicken that's so dry on the ends that you have to cut it off
It's a shame that this place can't put it together
I ate at City Grill for the first time last night
Walking by, it looked a little like a cheesy tourist place, but after I went inside I was pleasantly surprised to find a cozy deep red room with roses, fall foliage, and jack o lanterns
There was seasonal food like homemade applesauce and pumpkin soup
My father and I both had excellent food and the service was good
Not too expensive, either
Once we were seated it took another 15 minutes for the waiter to appear
Once we ordered, it took at least 30 minutes to get our food, with our server no where in site
no updates on the food etc
Mind you, we ordered an appetizer for brunch
The server brought the appetizer with the entree and the entrees were cold
The food is good at a decent price but the service is horrible
granted our server was pleasant but cold food that took for ever is not good service
We're impressed that our server genuinely cared about us, especially considering the rude, demanding diners around us
The same kind of people were near us other times there
Our waiter was honest about opinions of the menu items
My Tilapia/my husband's Hawaiin Salad were excellent, even with the changes we made
Another waiter was happy to get us more water while our waiter dealt with a woman throwing a fit that her coffee was hot but not hot enough and children who threw food and screamed for more juice every minute
I'm not sure how the staff stayed in such good spirits with the irrational demands being made by customers who seem oblivious to everything going on around them and who subsequently left 0 to 10% tips
If you like quality, inexpensive food and kind waiters, eat here

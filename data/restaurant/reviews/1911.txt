The staff is continually wonderfully sweet and knowledgeable
I enjoy coming to Kin Khao for the excellent food with tastes sensations from delicate (green leaf and rice noodle wrap with a seafood dipping sauce) to sumptuous (filet of salmon with red curry)
New York is great at creating different environments and Kin Khao is one special environment that when I walk through the door, I step into a world that exists in a beautiful dream of imagination where urban sophistication meets down to earth realness
Kin Khao is not special because of the environment or the food or the staff, but because of all of these elements find a perfect balance for not just SoHo, but for the New Yorker in us all
I love going to Thailand and I have been there many times over the years, but now that I eat at Kin Khao, it takes me back to the magic of being in that great country right here in SoHo
I could tell you what is delicious - EVERYTHING
I have a favorite or two, but to discover the joy of wonderful food at this restaurant is a pleasure that I leave for every individual
Don't worry the staff is very knowledgable and helpful
The word I want to use most often is charming
Kin Khao is simply the most charming restaurant serving up the best Thai food I have ever come across outside of Thailand
I have enjoyed Thai food in the city for years, and Kin Khao has been around forever and the reason is Kin Khao sets the standard for Thai food in New York
This weekend I went there again for a nice date and the accomodating staff help select a wonderful wine to accompany the delicious fish cooked in banana leaf and the hot and sour seafood soup is the perfect summer meal
Whenever I look for someplace new to eat, I remember the pleasure of a meal consistently done well and served by people who care, so back to Kin Khao, thankfully
Thank you Kin Khao for always gauranteeing me a wonderful night out
Kin Khao is the main ingredient to make a perfect evening out
I am not used to the pleasant and professional attitude of the staff who seemed happy to be there
But the true delight at Kin Khao is the sumptuous flavor of the food
I had a wonderfully light pappaya salad and a very hearty curry dish with delicious meat
The curry had hints of sweetness and went well with the white wine I had
I don't remember the wine, but I remember thinking how well the wine list complimented the food menu
Kin Khao provides a high quality of service, food and ambiance that make me excited to come back here and eat again
How can I express how great Kin Khao is without getting into hyperbole? This place is wonderful
I had the most romantic dinner in a long time at this rustic chic, understatedly opulent restaurant that serves up some of the most delicious Thai food I have had in this country
as an appitizer I had this delicious soup of red curry and chicken, along with a papaya salad
The counter balance of the two made the whole greater than the parts
I had shrimp, while my boyfriend had the steak
Both out of this world, the wine we had to go with really finished the meal beautifully
Service, food and ambiance - all were charming, sexy and fun
Thank you Kin Khao for a wonderful night out!
There is nothing average about this SoHo classic
Kin Khao has entered the pantheon of New York City restaurants serving my wife and I some of the best cooked Thai meals we have had in our lives
Now, they have updated their menu and I have a new favorite: an ample portion of deliciously fresh salmon served with an amazing red curry sauce
I have been watching my carb in-take and at Kin Khao, it is easy, the rice comes in a separate bowl
Bssically, Kin Khao delivers consistently delicious Thai food through the ups and downs of both trendy restaurants and diets
When my boyfriend and I eat at Kin Khao we feel like we are treated like royalty
To that end, I always get the grilled and marinated steak
And my boyfriend get the fish cooked in a banana leaf
The perfect appetizer, by far the best on the menu for us is the calamari
The place has a distinct, beautiful colonial elegance
When we dine there the staff are gracious and helpful
Kin Khao is my favorite restaurant to go to whenever I want to make a special nite!
We sat in very front of the restaurant, in the window seat, and the huge plate glass window is adorned with huge old-styled curtains
The women all had dresses and the place is dimly lit, it has an understated elegance mixed with a relaxed atomosphere that can only come from a confidence in the delicious food served here at Kin Khao
The three of us ate everything under the sun and it was all amazing
I am glad we ordered the evening's special
Butter fish marinated and with shitake mushrooms
Everything is incredible, there is no other place like Kin Khao
New York being so large, it is hard to find unique stand outs, but Kin Khao provides a breath of fresh air
I only recently discovered this place, but I am told it has been around for years
I can see why Kin Khao is an institution continually, quietly, producing some of the best Thai dishes in the city
Pad thai is served up everywhere - like Thai for pizza, it is all pretty good most of the time, but whatever Kin Khao's secret, pad thai is delicious here
But then they have more specail dishes
I love to indulge in the whole fish wrapped in a bamboo leaf and steamed
The this tender, juicy, flavorful fish is some of the best in my whole life; and the presentation of the meal transcends artistry to achieve majesty
Kin Khao is a lush wonderful environment to explore delicious Thai cuisine
Years ago, I took then girlfriend on a date to Kin Khao
The place was stylish and chic
The staff was very sexy, the food incredible
It was the best experience of thai in SoHo
The other night, I had occasion to take my now wife there again
Still, Kin Khao is a sexy thai restaurant with great food and great staff
Shrimp spring rolls, beef satay, pad thai, beef curry and a bottle of wine, all as great as I first remembered
The only thing I can't remember is why it has taken me so long to come
Kin Khao is so good I vow to myself to come more often; the place can't be beat in SoHo or anywhere in Manhattan
My wife and I ate a great meal at Kin Khao
We had an appitzer platter that was more of a meal
The platter had satay - skewered and sauteed meat deliciously grilled, and a green papaya salad - light tasty and healthy, then the plate was completed with spring rolls, crispy tofu and stifky rice - all of which were flavorful and delicious
Another appetizer was fried fish cakes, with red curry dipping sause, incredible and came with a nice chili cucmber salad perfectly contrasting with the curry sauce providing a balance of hot and cool
The cocktails were 'asain themed named' but familiar, my wife had a 'thaiphoon' a concoction of gin, mint and lime complete with a distressed umbrella, I had a pomegranate martini that tastes as lush as the color
I know that going back to Kin Khao for entrees will be a great treat
I have lived in SoHo for quite a while, I have seen many restaurants come and go
Those that remain are institutions
Kin Khao is an institution
Once you eat here, you will know why
I was there again on Saturday for a date and Kin Khao overtime has masted Thai cuisine
Sumptuous curries or flavorfully lite salads - vegetarian dishes to grilled steak, every taste strikes the perfect cord to create a harmonious dining experience
Heck, for dessert on Valentine's Day our sticky rice was in the shape of a heart
Eat here and you will know why Kin Khao never stops packing in a crowd of diners looking for a great experience
Coming from out of town, I expect a nice dinner and this week I had one of the best Thai meals I have had in a while
A couple of friends joined me and we had a bunch of appetizers and ended with a great entree
I had a great fish dinner I shared with friends, but starting we shared fish cakes that came with a nicely balanced red curry, and a green papaya salad that looked to good to eat with tomatoes and peanuts and very delicious
And a beef satay with a peanut sauce, the sauce was a little sweet, but we left no food on the plate
Finally, the fish, excellent, served in banana leafs, it was like christmas and unwrapping a great present
The tamarind sauce struck the perfect balance between tangy and sweet
I always leave this place happy
Kin Khao is good
but definitely not great! Seems a bit Americanized and while every dish hits the desired flavor they add nothing more or they over or underdoe a flavor
Like the prawn salad was way too overwhelming on the sauce, while the curry dishes were just a little to bland and sparse on the seafood
The absolute best dish here is the Pad Thai- the best I have ever had
but everything else is just acceptable The ambience is nice because it is intimate, but only if you have more than two people so you get a less claustrophobic table- go down to Grand and Crosby- Thai Angel- MUCH better and less crowded!!
I love this place
I wanted to make a reservation for my date, but you need to have a group to make reservations
As usual the place was busy, but it only took a few minutes for us to be seated
I think the Thai food is some of the best in the city - they have this fish dish where the whole thing is wrapped in a banana leaf and cooked, delicious
A real pleasure is the grilled pork chops, nowhere else in the city can you get porkchops like these, great
This place is great, once your hooked you will want to eat there every week
With so many affordable and delicious Thai eateries in the city, the only reason this place attracts people is because it is trendy
Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it
The service is awful, the wait is long, the wine is terrible, the atmosphere is only mediocre, and the food is simply middle of the road
Kin Khao will not be seeing my business again

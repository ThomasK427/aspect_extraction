There are good-looking people here, but not THAT good-looking but everyone certainly has a look at me air about them
It's worth a try, but maybe just do dinner
My boyfriend and I went after our friends raved about how great Asia de Cuba was
The atmosphere was nice, a little crowded, but nice and the service was superb
Everyone was super attentive and knowledgeable about the food and the portions
The food, however, was mediocre
the whole dining experience felt like fancy Chinese take-out
The lobster crabstickers were nothing to write home about
I had a sea bass dish that was pretty good and we got the coconut sticky rice which was 4 huge portions that could have fed a group of 6 was pretty good, but again nothing special
throughout the whole meal, all I kept thinking was AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE until the bill came, which was a little more than average,to say the least
When going with a large group be very careful when you order appetizers
The waiter doubled and even tripled the portions (and the prices) so that everyone in our large group could have some of each appetizer without asking if we wanted to do that
Otherwise, the food is wonderful
Asia is over as far as the scene goes - the crowd is either older men looking to hook up or BT - not impressive
But the food here is so amazing that my friend and I can't stay away
Lobster potstickers are divine - calamari salad cannot be beat and flourless chocolate cake is dreamy
Never have a reservation and never have a problem getting in and staff has always been wonderful (with a few exceptions)
Definitely go for appetizers or dessert, but don't go here for a hot scene - esp on the weekends
This used to be good, but it seems like the A staff has left for newer restaurants and what they have left is the B staff that doesn't know what they're doing
This is the kind of restaurant where you expect to get new knives and forks between courses
Instead they'll take the dirty ones from the plate and put them back on the table for you to finish your meal with
Very cool place
The family style menu and seating is very eclectic for a higher end restaurant
The atmosphere is beautiful with people to match
You must enjoy experimental flavors and cuisine to really enjoy Asia de Cuba
Don't be affraid to have an after dinner drink at Morgan's bar in the hotel afterwards
Very plush cool setting
A must try!
Ambiance and attentive wait staff! As for food, there wasn't that Oh my God, can you believe how good this dish is moment
Asia can be seen as expensive or not
The appetizers are expensive - $20 is a little high
We had the crab croquettas and were pleased (again, not blown away
) However, $30 on an shared entree is a great value
We split the Lime and Garlic Duck
The accompanying bok choy was divine
Drinks are $11, but Asia's interpretation of the mojito may be the best I've had! Especially appreciated the added touch of the sugar cane in the drink
(The same is done with the cappuccino
) Desert can also be a little pricey (for what you're getting) $11 for pineapple cheesecake (essentially) is borderline
In the final analysis I'd definitely return
But if it wer my last meal, you'd find me at Aquagrill!
I absolutely LOVE this place more and more each time I go! The FOOD is simply amazing, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is great
I always order the Calamari Salad and the Tunapica for appetizers
I recommend both to anyone that likes seafood! And for dessert, you can't go wrong with the Coconut Invasion
Asia de Cuba is simply the best
It's worth every penny
I never write reviews but this time I feel I have to
We had a reservation for Saturday night (which was made four days before)
Showed up a little before our reservation time and we were informed that there was no reservation
I do understand that mistakes happen
The *real* problem was that the person we communicated with treated us horribly
He didn't make any attempt to remedy the situation, didn't try to find out what the problem was, didn't offer alternatives, and we had to depart
Bottom line, there are no many choices in NY, you can safely avoid this one
I know I am never going back there again
Clearly the staff needs some lessons in attitude and manners
I came here for my birthday and the food is to die for
The portions are huge
They recommend if there are only two people having a meal to choose 2 appetizers and a main course
I of course didn't believe them and also had two side dishes
I could now feed an army
You must try the mashed potatos with lobster and the coconut rice is awesome
The bay of pigs for dessert is the way to go!!!! I love this place!
After being dissapointed by several so called hip and great restaurants in this city, I keep going back to Asia de Cuba for the amazing food
I often take people from out of town to give them the NYC experience, but it is really the quality of the food that impresses everyone, especially myself
The dishes are served family style and have clean, unique tastes that are hard to find elsewhere
The desserts like the coconut cake are outstanding too
I like the fact that they let regular folks in these days now that De Niro and his crew are long gone
Highly recommended
The scene here is what NY is all about
Beautiful people eating fusion food in a trendy chic atmosphere
Most dishes are served family style so you can taste different dishes but if you come alone, why not sit at the long communal table
The waiters were helpful and friendly with ordering
This place is SO Sex and the City
I went for my birthday dinner and it was a terrific experience
I didn't mind the wait, for we had great mohitos at the bar
We were seated pretty quickly and our server was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the amount of food to order
The food was out of this world
The pan seared tuna with wasabi mashed potatos were terrific
I will definitely go back soon and frequently
I've been to Asia de Cuba twice, but only once for food and I wish I had enough money to go back for more
My friend treated me - we had a long wait so downed a couple of the best mojitos I've had
We then split some appetizers as the portions are large - the calamari salad was fantastic
Great for people watching as there are a lot of beautiful people there
The waiter suggested we (two people) order two appetizers and one entree
That was way too much food
The calamari salad was huge (but delicious)--it could be a meal unto itself
The foi gras empanadas were OK--I would try another dumpling
The drinks were great, though
I recommend the coconut dream
For dessert we had the coconut cake, which was also heavenly
The crowd was non-existent on the Wednesday we went, which had the advantage of no wait for our table (even though we called an hour early and they said they only have a reservation for 9:00 pm)
Go if you have money to burn
My sister had her fiancee's 30th b-day at the communal table and it was soooo much fun
We had great food that just coming and coming and wonderful service
And after a few champagne cocktails thing just get better
I wish they would start with dessert
The platter of sweets was so amazing I wanted to take a picture of it
You'd think trendy places like this would lose their steam, but Asia is still a favorite after all these years
BRAVO
I went on a Friday night with some girlfriends, and we had a great time
We only waited about 10 minutes for a table, the service was incredible, and the food was amazing! Save room for the coconut cake

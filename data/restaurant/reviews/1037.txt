The a la carte is a deal as you get three pieces per order
The unagi (eel) pieces were not that well prepared
Other than that, the sushi eating experience was excellent
a korean-owned sushi joint, sandobe has never really had great sushi
too much mayo in every roll and sometimes unfresh fish always ruin it for me
but at least the old location had a nice cozy vibe to it
prices were low, you got a good deal, sushi was ok; everybody wins
the move to the new location has resulted in relatively high prices (for the e
village area) for this quality of food (this isn't jewel bako or tomoe)
the space is by no means ugly but it really has just become a generic sushi place
with so many other japanese restaurants in the e
village, why even come here?
This place is my first Sushi place and will remain my favorite
I used to go to the old location and now go to the new
LOOK
this is an upgradable society
Big WHOOP they moved
The food is still FAB and I recommed it to all my family and friends
That means a lot because I am a finiky eater! :-) ENJOY!
They should've left well enough alone
My fiance and I loved the spot on 11th street and all that came with it
I've been going to Sandobe since late 2000 and usually once a week since we moved to the neigborhood in 2002
If we wanted sushi, we went to Sandobe
Didnt even bother to consider anywhere else
The setting was boring but who cared? The price was right and the the sushi was plentiful and delish
Now that they've moved into the old Bendix space, the decor is too trendy, the portions have been decimated and the price has skyrocketed
The only good thing is that they now serve wine
We're looking for a new once a week spot
Boo to the move
Hadn't been there since December, almost cried (literally) until I found out they're around the corner
Don't worry about Sandbobe phase 2, just because it no longer has that uberhip, removed dinginess it still rocks
The rolls cost a little bit more but you won't get knocked in the head by someone walking through or sitting behind you and the food's still fantastic
Adding Jeollado's menu doesn't hurt either
Go on in and enjoy, when you're done your hipster ideals won't be compromised ;)
This is really crappy
I loved the old sandobe, I would go 3 times a week to order my standard roll
I knew everyone there and they knew me and then the new place opened on first
It seems like Sandobe is trying to become a Sushi Samba and lost the east village hip feeling
It's nice inside, waiters are dressed as waiters, it's has an expanded menu
It takes credit cards, but the sushi is pretty much the same
The cost of rolls have been bumped up 2 bucks but still great value for the amount of sushi
There are no more 'full' special rolls, they are all the half (15 pieces)
Not sure how many times I will return
I feel like I've lost my little sushi joint for it to make more money and be more upscale
It is truely a sad day for sushi lovers
Sandobe devotees will be awakened by an amazing, yet relieved, surprise that the 11th St drab has moved, not only in venue but comfy, spacious ambiance
The menu now reflects its siblings with more selections and desserts w/no compromise on its amazing value
A praised, lovely new do that now perfects your sushi experience
This resturant is not worth the trip
As soon as we sat down the manager approached us handed us our menus and asked for our order
We said we'd like a little more time
Literally two minutes later he was back again he came back and asked again
We told him we wanted a little more time
We were then informed we could only stay at the table for 50 min and then we would have to leave
For a meal over $100 for two people we were outraged
The manager was rude, the drinks took 30 min to arrive (halfway through our allotted amount of time)
I would not recommend this place to anyone
The food is average the prices high and the whole experience was very upsetting
Awful
We arrived on time the restaurant was empty, but they insisted we sit at the bar
When they realized we would only order water we were allowed to sit at our table
The waiter tried to sell us cocktails ($15
) After 20 minutes waiting for wine, we had to demand menus
We ordered food another server came over tried to sell us a side dish
I thought someone would try to sell us a used car
Our apps arrive -- suddenly, no service
Ran out of bread sat for 15 minutes, at which point our waiter started clearing our half-eated mezzes
We asked for bread
Another 15 minutes
My entree came 40 minutes before my freind's
It was a 3 hour dinner, most spent staring at an empty table
This restaurant hopes you'll fill the time drinking their over-priced alcohol
MAJOR RIP OFF
I finally found the most romantic restaurant right in midtown
I no longer have to go downtown for a romantic dinner
The theme is Arabian Nights with billowy, tent-like seating
A belly dancer entertains
I had dinner there recently, and I had a wonderful time
I live around the block and Im so happy to have found this restaurant
The food was unbelievably delicious, the decor and service, everything was perfect
Such a fun place
I liked the bar area as well
Everything is so nicely decorated
If you are looking for an out of the ordinary place to eat, I suggest Casa La Femme
Dont forget to try one of their signature cocktails - mango cosmopolitan
The friendly staff has a let's put on a show enthusiasm
The room is beautiful
The location is terrific
It adds up to a dining experience that's more than the food
I just celebrated my bday at Casa with 18 of my friends
I had the best time
All my friends had fun and we ended up staying until they closed
Excellent food
I was very happy to see how they managed us at their restaurant considering the restaurant was full with other customers
Everyone was so accommodating, they made sure we were all happy and took care of us
The employees were all very friendly, vibrant and enthusiastic
They played good music and the belly dancer was very entertaining
I cant wait to go back there for a romantic dinner with just my girl friend and dine in one of the private tents
I highly recommend it for any occasion or just for a quiet romantic dinner
I even got a flower from the hostess as I was leaving

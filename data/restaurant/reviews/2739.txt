The staff moves as if they have been doing it all their lives
Peter Luger is definitely a happy tummy experience
Ladies and Gentlemen,  One doesn't go to Luger's for the ambience
Simply put, one goes to Peter Luger's for the most exquisite, mouth watering, porterhouse steak that any restaurant could possibly offer! Please don't forget to order the creamed spinach
This combo goes together like Lennon and McCartney
For desert, it's usually a toss-up between the NY cheesecake or chocolate mousse
By the way, the whipped cream, otherwise known as shlaagg is to die for
This is the best steak restaurant that I have ever been too
Besides some of the best cuts of meat in this city, the mouthwatering steak sauce, cottage fries and creamed spinach make it a complete meal worth every penny
The ambience is simple, yet elegant and be sure to finish your meal with their famous shlog
You haven't had whipped cream, until you've had theirs
If your looking for simply the finest cut and tasting beef than this may well be the best
However, if your looking for a complete dining experience this steakhouse is mediocre at best
Don't ask for a filet, they don't have it
It's steak for 1, 2, 3, or 4
Porterhouse that melts in your mouth, but I have had just as good elsewhere
I've been told by friends and acquaintances from all walks of life that this was IT for steak
Well, four years ago, I tried it for the first time
It was very good, but it did not knock my socks off
Subsequently, I've been back another two times
Each time, I've come up with the same conclusion, the meat is excellent, but only with the sauce
It'd definitely the sauce
The spinach is to die for though
The atomsphere, well, you've got to be in the mood for it
While a great piece of steak, I've had better
Let us not mince words when there is so much else to digest
This is, hands down, the best steak in New York
The meat is always done to perfection in tghose overns that came over on the boats with Columbus
The waiters are a show in themselves
For this much quality and quantity, it isn't even too pricey
One shortfall--if you're not into meat, the rest of the offerings are pretty mediocre
Absolutely the best! I have been to many steakhouses
Thank God I got the opportunity to go to Peter Luger Steak House
Bad thing is, a steak house or two that I thought was great prior to my experience at Peter Luger, just does not come up to par anymore
If you only eat steak once in a blue moon, this is the place to do it
Just order what the waiter tells you to and enjoy
And don't forget to make reservations a few weeks in advance
Truly a Classic without question in my experience the outstanding steak house in the good ole usa
This is the BEST steakhouse in the US
You cannot beat having the waiter spooning butter over your steak before you are served!! And the Luger sauce is so good I had to buy a couple of bottles to bring home
Expensive but worth your money
Tender steaks
With great atmosphere
The steak is the best, I would definitely recommend it, but the service was REALLY bad
There were people waiting to be seated and the impression we got was that they wanted us to eat really fast and go, very aggravating
Peter Luger is hands down the top steak house in the US
During the 57 years I've been on this Earth, I've been to many top-notch steak restaurants in almost every major US city
Nothing compares to a steak for 2 at Peter Luger in Brooklyn
It is tender and juicy
It has a distinct flavor that is incompareable
Peter Luger is the best place in the world for steak
the steak was by far the most flavorful I've ever tasted
Even my squeamish friend (who shuddered at the butter the waiter poured on the steak) loved it
Don't miss the creamed spinach, skip the frieeees
Obviously bz place, greeting was less than welcoming, service was adequate from less than friendly waiters, steak for 2 was anything but spectacular served with sauce that's better suited for seafood than meat
Overall, its not what it sounded like
Not worth driving to B'klyn for this
Everyone knows that Peter Luger is the best steak house
For steak lovers it's a sure thing
But the best testiment to Luger's is when a non-meat lover becomes a fan
My friend Helen doesn't eat beef because she doesn't like the taste
She went to Luger's because our friend really wanted to go with all his friends
She reluntantly took a bite and then continued to eat until she had a fair portion
She still doesn't eat meat except on the occasions we go to Peter Luger's
Went their with some friends this past weekend
Had a short wait, but it was no big deal
Waiter was great
Service was great, and the food was awesome
I have been to some of the better steakhouses around the country, and bar none this was the best
Steak was tender and cooked to perfection, no matter how anyone in the group ordered it
Creamed spinach was great, and so where the Luger german potatoes
Can't wait to go back
peter luger is a MAN'S steak house
don't listen to all those wussies that hate on it because there are no tablecloths or if there is bad service
which btw isn't bad at all
if you want to be pampered then eat somewhere else
but if you want the best porterhouse steak that money can buy, then luger's is the top choice
the steak is juicy, tender, and aged very well
the desserts are not bad either, put some of that schlag (whipped cream) on whatever dessert you are having and it is sure to make you a happy camper
the bacon appetizer is great, very tasty
don't forget to order the side of potatoes, it is one of luger's specialties
I went to Peter Luger last week with some friends from out of town and was INCREDIBLY dissapointed
From the loud, frat-boy atmosphere (and crowd), to the small, totally unsatisfying steak, it was overall an underwhelming experience
As far as the steak itself, it was, unlike some reviews would have you believe, nowhere near the best steak I've ever had
Not only is Peter Luger's not the best steakhouse in the country, it is not even the best steakhouse in New York
Go to Dylan Prime
You don't have to take the J train and you'll find a much classier atmosphere and a far superior steak
My son took me to PL as a christmas gift
It took a long time to arrange a reservation and the soonest one we could get was a 2:45 pm on a Sunday
A dinner res
would have us wait another month
Coming from The Island it was difficult to find but after a few wrong turns we got there
The neighborhood was grungy but there was a PL lot to park with an attendant
The place was under renovations, not pretty either
The restaurant itself was nothing to write home about
After a 15 min
wait at the bar we were seated at a table for four
We ordered the Porterhouse for two
By far the best steak I have ever experienced and I am 58
And the cheese cake was also the best

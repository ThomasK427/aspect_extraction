The food was not terrible but with the prices as high as they are, I should expect better
And have you ever been to a Spanish restaurant that served Itailan bread and a green salad before the meal? That's just strange
The atmosphere is diner-like
I won't be back
I've been coming here for years
This is by far the best Spanish cuisine I have ever had
With out exagerating I can literally say its comparable to some of the restaurants I have been to in Malaga
El Olivo's Mariscada (stewed shellfish) is out of this world! Their steaks are really good too
We always get the serrano ham as an appetizer
We arrived at 2pm
We ordered a salad and the traditional meal of roast lamb (menu price $12)
After we finished our salad our waitress told us that they had run out of roast lamb and pastitichio
She suggested baby lamb instead (menu price $18)
We said okay
The table behind us was very upset saying koirodevunee to kosmo they are fooling the public This is because they were seating people without saying they had run out of lamb--and at just 2 in the afternoon!!! When the bill came---not only did we not get what we originally wanted--roast lamb at $12, but now we were being charged not just $18 for baby lamb BUT $20 BECAUSE IT IS EASTER  We are outraged that this restaurant planned so poorly on such an important holiday and ran out of the traditional food and then had the nerve to fleece us too!!
The cooks in the front are very friendly and helpful
Once seated the waitress took over 10 minutes to come by and only said you ready
She could have cared less that we were eating in the restaurant, eventhough the service around us appeared much quicker
The saganaki was among the worst I have ever tasted, hard and rubbery, which we sent back
The skordalia, stuffed peppers and shrimp were fantastic, although the skordalia was served to us without anything to dip in it
It took another ten minutes to get some bread, and they don't have pita
The house wine was tasteless as well
All in all, if you are not Greek you will receive poor service, as everyone seated after us was being served before our order was even taken
I have been to plenty of Greek restaurants and this ranks among the worst
I will not return
The restaurant from the outside is not much to speak of
But you realize how popular it is within the Greek community once you walk inside


and you know a restaurant is great when people are willing to wait outside in line to get a table
The food was excellent (everything we tried), the service was very attentive, and the bill was even better
For 6 of us the bill came out to $101 including alcohol
We all left stuff and with a smile on our face
This is one of the restaurants that I have to eat at when I visit from Houston
The entrees are large enough to share and reasonably priced
I highly recommend sharing so that you'll have room for the complimentary dessert
It's easy to understand why my sister's Greek landlords recommend this place
Great variety of cooked and grilled dishes
Try the greek salad, fried zucchini, giant beans in tomato sauce and grilled octopus for starters
The grilled snapper or porgy is great
The cooked dishes vary depending on when you get there but they are generally solid
Stay away from the baby lamb chops - too small and salty for the price
You get complementary galactobouriko (custard in phyllo) for dessert which is out of this world
This diner won me over the moment I stepped inside where the place is adorned with vintage Ditmars (N Train) stop murals and photographs
Its subway theme puts a neighborhood touch to the place and I've noticed more business each time I've been back
The service was great as well, personalized and quick
The food is decent, with its Italian specialties (soups + brick oven pizza) being the most popular items on the menu
With low prices and great service, I recommend this diner to anyone who's willing to go to the last stop on the N/W line
I love the last stop
It's got above-average diner and italian fare, and it's right near the subway
But the true reason to love this place is the pasta fagioli
It is probably the best soup I've ever had
The Last Stop Cafe has very good pizza
Try the feta-spinach or eggplant toppings
Good brunch spot as well
Killer brick oven pizza
You have the choice of adding fresh, homemade mozzarella to it, as well as a large assortment of toppings
They also have great breakfasts until 4:00pm, wonderful pasta and chicken dishes, and some surprisingly good sandwiches
The baked ziti with garlic knots is out of this world! They have Boylan's root beer, coffee that's freshly ground that day, and a relaxed casual atmosphere with friendly waitresses
I go to Pizza Palace way more than anyone should
The thin crust pizzas especially are fabulous, but everything is satisfying
I love the pizza here
They make pizza the way you should with lots of sauce
Highly recommend this place
Plus the owners are the nicest guys
The pizza is divine and the italian dishes scrumptious
The prices are reasonable and service friendly
You can not get pizza like this anywhere else I have ever been
LOAF BREAD AS GOOD AS IT GETS
But look deeper into the shelfs,cookies(Wineturtle positivly BARKS when they have the BIIG soft crumb Choc
Chip cookie Soda bread Hot cross buns(should carry these all year) They bake a rack of pies daily but the early turtle gets the apple so go early
Wineturtle always buy a Hero loaf for the walk home otherwise the eating while walking gene kicks in and Miss Subways says Wheres the bread?????? Turtle hint :owner has a good Racehorse usually worth a bet
I have lived in Astoria for the past year and this bakery is the best I have ever been to!!! The Italian bread, Irish Soda bread and the cookies are out of this world
You have to try their red velvet cupcakes
They are so good!
Most of the desserts I've gotten here have been very good, but occasionally they really miss the mark
Stick to the pies, avoid the cannolis, and be willing to wait until the salesgirl gets off the phone to take your order
Some of the desserts really are great, though, and it's well priced, so I like to support them while they (hopefully) work out the kinks
The food is very good for the price
The service is also good and fast
The only problem is that sometimes they don't have everything that is in their menu
Coming from a Greek home where the quality of a meal was held to the strictest standards of freshness, quality, taste and care, Stamatis Broadway is the closest I've been able to find to satisfy the home cooking craving
The majority, if not 99%, of the clientele is Greek, so you know you are getting the real deal
Known favorites for all tastes are prepared exceptionally (souvlaki, befteki (beef patties), horiatiki salata, roast lamb and chicken); try the grilled squid, stuffed cabbage leaves and their peas and artichokes for a more traditional approach to their kitchen
And for fish lovers, choose your fresh fish from the front and ask them to grill it for you!
Excellent restaurant!! The food is very good and the people working there are very nice
I go there every week
The food in this place is amazing! Decor is fun and bright
Staff is curteous and friendly
Great for large crowds
It truly is the best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted! The flavor is amazing, the meat is always moist, never dry
And you've gotta try the sauce that comes with it!! I'm not sure how they did it, but I'm glad they did :) The prices are dirt cheap, you can actually have a full meal for around $5
The only negative thing is that the place doesn't look all that nice, so a lot of people get take-out
this place has good food
seafood is great! get the octupus
order the cheese too! unlike the usual greek restaurants i've been to
it's real greek dishes (not just greek salad, falafel, gyro, etc
if you want the usual, don't go here, these items are not even on the menu)  downside is: hummus is disappointing
i wouldn't get any meat dishes, they are dry and tough
this place is a little pricey and the portions are average in size

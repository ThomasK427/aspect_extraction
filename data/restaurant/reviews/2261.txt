The foos was great, the service was to notch and the live music really added a different flair to the night
Although Russian food is a bit heavy, it is not for the picky eater
I like the food a lot
Used to work nearby, too bad I can't go there often now
Service is very good
Lunch specials are very affordable
The place is very nicely decorated
The Scene This is Woody Allen's New York, a borscht-belt scene of wisecracking waiters, cramped convivial tables and a din just short of Times Square on a Saturday night
Head shots of movie stars are the decor, and undersized tables are tightly arranged
The Food The Carnegie is renowned for its pastrami and corned beef sandwiches, which are home-cured and deliciously briny, rich, but not fatty, and thicker than a Russian novel
Lean, tender beef brisket also should not be missed
Other favorites are the chubby cheese blintzes with sour cream, succulent baked short ribs with mashed potatoes, Nova Scotia salmon omelette and stuffed cabbage with sweet and sour sauce
The cheesecake will bring you to your knees
I came with a tour group
The leader of our tour group told us to go in groups of four so it didn't look like that big of a group
He said that the waiters were rude last time cause there was too many people
Do NOT order the roast beef sandwich
This was such a letdown that I signed up for a Citysearch account just now so I could write a review
I went here with my fiance after MoMA--we were hungry, tired from walking around the museum all afternoon, so it seemed like a fun idea
Wrong! I ordered a bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese, thinking, hey, this is NY, it will be awesome
Wrong again! The menu claimed the bagel was jumbo-sized and toasted, and it was neither--small and cold
The cream cheese was hard as a rock--whatever happened to the double whipped, light, and fluffy stuff that melts in your mouth? The salmon was ok
It was served with a huge boulder of lettuce, white onion, and tomato
What about red onion and some capers? All for $19
95
Let me tell you--Jerry's Deli in LA knows how to do a bagel with lox and cream cheese
My fiance got a Reuben
The corned beef was ok--not too greasy--but frankly, it just wasn't that impressive
Forcing people to pay $20 for four times the food you need is not a winning attribute
Furthermore, ok, this may just be a New York thing (I'm from SF), but there were no free refills on sodas
Dude, the margins on sodas are huge
If you're going to gouge people on sandwiches, spring for some refills! The bill came to $57 including tip
What?!? My fiance is telling me to let it go but that was the biggest waste of $57 we'll ever spend
By the way, it's cash only here
There were two positives from my experience: I was sitting near an autographed photo of Gene Siskel, which was both appealing and sad, thinking how his life was cut short
Also, the pickles they served in the beginning--the dull green pickles had the most unusual taste--quite good
The bright green ones just tasted like cucumber
By the way, I am not a crackpot
As long as I'm on a soapbox, I'll review Lombardi's Pizza (fabulous!)
Be on the lookout for a review of Nobu tomorrow!
The food was pretty good but the vibe is strange
It feels like a nursing home cafeteria
the prices are ridiculous
$25 for a sandwich! and it didn't even come with anything
fries were $5
And if you want to share
it's is $3 extra
This place is so stupid it's funny
i would NEVER GO BACK
I love the Carnegie Deli
Their hot pastrami sandwich is outstanding!   Having said that, it is outrageously expensive
There are so many better deals in town
The seating is crowded
Go there only to eat and nothing more
The wait staff is rude and terribly slow
And the cash only, no refills on soda, make this a bit less desirable
But if you find yourself in Times Square and hungry, check it out
Make sure to get a cheese cake to go! Yum
Made the mistake trying lunch at this place, waitress was rude right off the bat (I'm a former waitress, so I keep it simple, I'm not a fussy customer) - but from the moment I placed my order I was looking forward to leaving, the vibe is that wierd
$15
00 for a grilled cheese and fries was crazy, I should have left when I saw the price on the menu
My friend, an out of towner, couldn't believe how bad the service was! Clearly, they want you to get out ASAP - no problem, I'm never going back! Nothing special about this place, except how much they hate serving the public
And what restaurant doesn't take credit cards? Amazing
There's no talent to throwing large lumps of meat between two slices of bread and that's all they do
There was no lettuce, tomator or any of the other fixings normally found in sandwiches, just the gargantuan amount of meat
I was truly expecting much more from this famed establishment and was completely disappointed
Will never use them again
This is a fun place to take guests from out-of-town - great delicious New York-y food in mega portions along with a dose of Manhattan-diner atmosphere (crowded tables, headsho--covered walls, etc)
A bit overpriced for a local (most locals have a favorite spot to get this food for less $) but not unheard of prices for tourists and those entertaining them
The sandwiches were piled so high, our guests took pictures of them! If, like me, you can't imagine getting one of those towering creations, get a knish and some blintzes, they're awesome
The pierogis, however, are forgettable (better to get those elsewhere in the city)
In the mood for matza-ball soup, 4 of us waited in the long line to get in on a Saturday afternoon
After being seated, the waiter (who had worked there forever) threw some cutlery at us and waited to take our order
At $20 for a monster-sized sanwich and a $3 addre for sharing (ridiculous), I opted for a smaller grilled cheese sandwich which came barely melted (they took it back and re-made it) but it wasn't great
Soup was huge (for $7
00/bowl) and fries were ok
When ordering a turkey burger, the waiter asked my sister why she didn't just get a turkey sandwich
Uh, hmmm
I would NOT run back to Carnegie deli - I could have made a better sandwich myself for free
This place was great! Just had to try it the next day after I saw the line outside
I will come back again!
Ate here when I was visiting NY
Had planned on going to Katz, but never made it there at the right time
We stumbled across this place which my friend said she recognized from Letterman
We shared a beheamoth pastrami and some coleslaw
it was delicious
some tourists next to us were having what looked like a good dessert, but we were too full for it
fast service, clean, comfortable
loved this place
YES, It is TOURIST TRAP
Costomer service is horrible
I and my friends had cheesecakes and had very bad time
Minmum charge $12
50 Per Parson, Sharing fee $3
00
There is no smile and no good worker
We wanted a NY deli experience
The food was delicious and it was fun looking at the tightly displayed celeb pictures
Although it was spacious, the tiny tables were packed so close together one might feel claustrophobic
You can hardly move your chair to get in and out

Unfortunately, we were disappointed
The menu we were given was different than the one online (fewer options from each section) and the food was very mediocre
Service was friendly warm until the end when the waiter told us he couldn't change a $20 and then wouldn't let us put the meal on several cards! He finally went down the street to get change when we told him that left us with no options
The ambiance at this place was great, so it's unfortunate the food wasn't too great
May have hit it on an off night, but I probably won't give it a second chance
Seemed more like a place for their friends to hang out than a real restaurant
We have been to this restaurant twice and enjoyed it! The chesse plate is great
So is the cabbage soup (which was a special)
They had a decent selection of wine and the service was wonderful
Overall, it a nice place for a quiet dinner
Quhnia Restaurant the food is great wow! spectacular dishes like blini with caviar fantastic roast duck and the brunches are great too
The place is cozy and comforting try them out
My friend and I stumbled on this quiet spot in the East Village on a late Sunday evening
My friend started off with a light borscht and I started off with a selection of delicious artisanal cheeses
We both had the beef stroganoff for the main course
The beef stroganoff was very good and hearty
They have a large selection of vodkas and a good selection of wines
The service was warm and friendly
This place is good if you're in the mood for a quiet place to have a relaxing, hearty meal with friends
I took my working team here and the food was excellent
Excellent service too!  Enjoy!
My boyfriend and I enjoyed such a fantastic meal at Ancora this past Friday
The service was perfect and our dinner was exactly what Italian food should be
I am so happy we found this resturant downtown
Everyone I know that has eaten in Ancora loves the service and the food
The staff is friendly and service is very professional and very prompt
Even though the place is always busy, you're treated like they really appreciate your business
The food is great and rivals any of the top Italian eateries in NYC
My only complaint is the acoustics
the main dining room (downstairs) can get very noisy
This place is awesome
Great italian food - by far the best in the financial district
Amazing service, almost bizarre how good the service is
i live down there and its a bit too pricey to eat there all the time
great food though
Very attentive service and excellent food
They will make you anything you want if they have the ingrediants, and you will love it! Freshest of meats and seafood
Recommend the stuffed calamari, shrimp and crab stuffed ravioli, steaks, veal marsala, veal chop, and everything else
Comfortable atmosphere/environment with well spaced tables, excellent bar, very friendly attentive restaurant
Good for groups, or intimate settings
Highly recommend!!!
i went thre for lunch this week
if i read citysearch before i will never go there again
like throw my money to garbage
Food and service is terrible
i wait for grilled chicken over 30 min
and its over cook and not tastyyyyy
I wish I had read the reviews before I went there
Not much to say rude people, bad service,bad food
They should be closed for bussiness
My boyfriend and I walked over to grab a bite from this cute restaurant on 2nd ave 49th St
we brought our own bottle of pinot and went to town
the doner was soo amazing
tarama and humas mezze
WOW best around
the chef orhan made us this fantastic steak
BEST part was the bill 40 BUCK
sweet !!
I arrived at Sip Sak last Saturday at 8:30pm
We were seated right away, the waiter couldn't have been friendlier and attentive (he even gave me a free beer and baklava) and the food was fantastic
We were left to enjoy our beers and baklava after dinner, not at all rushed
So I'm not sure why some people had such a bad experience at Sip Sak but I'd recommend it to anyone and am looking forward to going back again very soon
I wish I had read the reviews on Citysearch before trying to order from this horrible place
I had the same experience with the rude service
First they tell me that they will deliver to my office if I order $40 worth of food
Then, after I organize lunch orders for 9 people, with an order of well over $40, they tell me that they will only deliver to me if I pay for their cab- during the lunch rush in the rain
When I said I would not pay for their cab, they refused to take my order
I will never do business with them again after that unprofessional behavior
I don't care how good the food is- this is New York City- there is ALWAYS another option
I have never written a bad review in my life
As a former waiter, I understand how the occasional forgetful server, cold dish, etc
can happen
However, this warrants an exception
The owner is unbelievably rude and obnoxious to customers
I consider myself a calm easy person, yet somehow, when trying to place an order, I had him YELLING at me
I have no clue as to why this happened
Apparently some sort of miscommunication took place, and all I know is that I was the receiving end of some appalling behavior
The owner is horrible, irrational and emotionally abusive
I walked out so I never got to try the food
Not bad of a place
It was very hot inside which was a little uncomfortable
The apps seemed to be pre made as right after we ordered they were at our table instantly
The food was pretty tastey with some nice spice to it
It's a good place to grab a quick bit to eat
Nothin out of this world but yet nothing terrible
The service was so awful to us, we didn't make it through the meal! The story, which I swear is true: my girlfriend ordered a salad with no dressing and I ordered the okra with lamb
He didn't write down the order
When it comes, not only is there barely any meat in my dish, but my girlfriend's salad has dressing! When we tell the woman who brought the meal, she says that she was listening and we didnt say no dressing (she did!)
She started arguing with us! The waiter comes over and says You changed the salad and made us throw it out! Thanks! I was so perturbed that I asked for the check
He said Dont Pay! Get Out! I asked what happened to customer service and he said Youre not a customer, youre a disease! Can you believe this? I was appalled
WILL NEVER GO BACK!
Sip Sak is a great place for reasonably priced and delicious Turkish food
The BYOB policy makes the food quite a steal
My favorite dishes are the hummus appetizer and the baked lamb eggplant
I've never had a problem with the service -- the waiters have always been nice and friendly -- but I do not like their policy for take home leftovers
Usually, doggy bags are filled in the kitchen but here they bring the container over and ask you to do it yourself!
Sip Sak is not the place to go for ambience or romance
You go for the great food at good prices (being that it is NYC prices)
Yes, it can get crowded and you'll wait for a table
Yes, the owner can get hot-blooded (though I've never had a problem)

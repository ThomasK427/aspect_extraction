There are plenty of wonderful places in the city without terrible service
My girlfriend I ate at this place for the first and last time
The restaurant was very empty (as one would expect when bad food bad service are combined
The 'fresh haas guacamole we ordered had a consistency that can only be created when it freshly made straight from the packet
Our fajitas came on a sizzling platter that had no sizzle and the rice and beans plate truly looked as though it had been out for two nights (the beans had a crustiness i avoid in all foods)
The service was unresponsive at best, and totally invisible when we tried to pay and leave
The margaritas were mediocre, but it did not make up for the muzak they played in the resturant nor the bad food and drink they served
Recently was in the Village with a buddy of 30 years, looking for a place to eat
I remembered this restaurant on MacDougal St
that I loved in the 1970's
I located it right where I had hoped it would be, ambience and menu intact!! I ordered a deelish cheezy tostada and a nice frigid beer
Walked out of the joint for like $15 w/o tip, which I gladly gave to, you guessed it, an NYU coed!!
As the title says the waitresses appear to be NYU phillies who do their jobs well and without attitude
The food is ok, the vibe is average, but, if you just want to spend $25/person (including 2 drinks), on ok Tex-Mex,this is the place for you
The prices are high, the service is lousy and the food is mediocre at best
Unfortunately, my friends like the margaritas here and every time I go I remember why I avoid it like the plague
The wait staff is slow, full of attitude and forgettful--often taking 20 minutes to bring another round of food and drinks
Pitchers of frozen strawberry margaritas run $40
Yes, $40
Grab a blender and have a better time at home
Or anywhere else
This is a place to go with a group of friends or for a quick bite before heading off to something else
The service is average as is the atmosphere
The food isn't great, but the tamale is quite nice
My favourite thing about this place is the drinks
They have plenty of interesting choices, my favourite being the Kremlin Egg Cream
The food is great especially the mole chicken but a frozn white russian or a kremlin egg cream would make you want to get your passport stamped and then defect
With 3 pages of liqour and 1 page you can't go wrong
Who could ask for more!
This was just about the most insulting mexican food I've ever had
The chicken had a fetid flavour, and the beans strangely resemble dirt ( or at least what I imagine dirt tasting like)
Our waitress though, Winnie, was really nice and cute, also very responsive when I sent back my gasoline flavoured margherita
The only rectifiable item was the stuffed jalepeno peppers, which I'm sure were shipped frozen from a remote location
The atmosphere could be considered amiable, if you possess roguish frat-boy nostalgia
Everytime I go to the city this place is a must
I try something new everytime I go and am always pleased
The waiters are so kind and go the extra mile to make your meal perfect
If you are looking for an authentic Italian meal this is the place!
My Italian-American family has been eating at Porto Bello for the entirel 20 years it's been open - we just can't get enough
Authentic, reasonably priced food and impeccable service
Don't miss an opportunity to eat here!
My favorite
I was in the city for 4 weeks and I ate there 5 times
The spinich ravioli with tomato cream sauce is amazing and the cannolis are the best I have ever had (and I have had alot)
Its abit pricy but its better than eating in Nolita
The service is impecable
Extemly good food, nice service
You can find the some unique italian meals
Romantic
I lived in New york most of my life and frequented this restaurant over the years since the 1950's
I now live in the south and while visiting NY I went to my ol standby and was disappointed
The atmosphere was the same, the food tasted good, but for what I got I think it was over priced
I had pasta with sausage and while the taste was there I had trouble locating more than two very small pieces of sausage
Pasta and greens are cheap it would need more sausage to justify the price
Although it looks a little shabby on the outside Minetta Tavern houses one of the best Italian menus in the city
The staff is very kind and the homemade ravioli is to die for
Everything on the dessert cart is amazing
I make it a point to go at least once a month
On Valentine's Day the host gave lady patrons a red rose! Just a wonderful place
I loved this place
I am origanally from Jersey and now reside in Denver
My sister Peggy and brother-in-law John took me here in December '03
They are regulars here
Everything was awesome for the time we walked in the door
The owner made me feel like we had known each other for years
The food,wine and atmosphere was wonderful
I ended the evening with a glass of Sambuca w/ a coffee bean
PERFECT
Thank you John and Peggy
Tink
Great local place
Owner, Taka, mans the bar and he's great
Food, drinks, atmosphere, history are all there
The only negative was the waiter we had wasn't very responsive
I'll still stop by there every time I'm in New York
Great food, great wine list and staff and regulars welcome you like you were a long lost friend
What more could a homesick guy working in NY from England want!
My friend surprised me by taking me here to eat
We had wonderful wines, the appetizer of mussels was excellent and the entree was magnificent
It's a very cozy and friendly place and you don't feel crowded
We spent a little money but it was well worth it
Will definately be eating at Minetta again soon!
In Short In winter, this cheery space glows with flickering candlelight and warm comfort
In summer, when they open up the charming garden in the back, it's flush with sun
The Euro-accented crowd flocks here for bistro staples, like steak frites and steak au poivre, as well as the regions seafood specialties, such as hearty bouillabaisses and bourrides
Seasonal specials change daily
Great french food in a romantic setting, good service and reasonable prices
They oysters were very fresh, as was the lemon-crusted cod (and perfectly prepared); the steak was quite good too
When I made the reservation, I asked them to bring out a tarte tatin with a candle, for my wife's birthday
Without any additional prompting or reminding, they brought it out shortly after we finished dinner
Overall, a great dining experience
The only drawback is on a nice night, when they have the windows open, there's a lot of cigarette smoke wafting back in from smokers outside
This is one of my favorite rooms, all I know is I feel totally comfortable when I walk in
It's almost like walking into my own little house in the mountains of Provence (if I had one, that is)
So let's see:  Service last night was perfect
It isn't always, but it was last night
Our waiter was personable without being ingraciating, knowledgeable, there when needed, but otherwise invisible
The food last night was great too, it almost always is
Pissaladiere was crunchy, fish soup was perfectly balanced, we had duck and chicken (what do the french do to chicken anyway?)
both savory

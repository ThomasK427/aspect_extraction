Excellent
Delectable dining, perfect service and again the most luscious italian meal I have ever had the pleasure of tasting
Food was spectacular, service was amazing, atmosphere is average but is a must visit!
Pure and simple - heaven
The only suffering you'll experience here is when you receive the bill
Reservations have to be made way in advance for this restaurant
It's not hot, it's not cool
But it's fantastic, great atmosphere, great location
And they give you more good food between the time you sit down here and the time you order than you can ever get in most places
It's a real Italian food experience that people people are willing to reserve and wait for year round
One of the best meals I have ever had
Well worth the wait
Does not appear to be well known by tourists
Those were my words when my rack of lamb arrived
It WAS a portion for one, but was large enough to serve our table of 4! Very good, but way too much and expensive for one
Most of the dishes we had were too garlicky and greasy
The gratis appetizers are wonderful, but fill one up too much to enjoy the dinner
I would recommend paring down the portions (and the prices too)
Very crowded and a long wait for our table, avoid weekends!
Hands down
it doesn't get better than Il Munlino, but good luck getting a reservation
From the moment we sat down, the waitstaff began prepping us for the meal to come, moving with the swift precision of backstage makeup artists at a runway show
The appetizers were Italian cuisine must-haves, followed by a main course equivalent of haute couture
The menu is finely tailored and pricey, but--as with high fashion--you pay for the name and reputation, which does not disappoint
The atmosphere lacks panache, but with the food at center stage you will barely notice your surroundings
Incredible traditional Italian food, the best in the city
Will not find any better in all of Manhattan, possibly the U
S
I found Il Mulino to be over-rated, and my wife, who ate there a week later, agrees
The service was good and the food was good - but not great
The dishes were generally too salty and many of the dishes were greasy
Very expensive for such a crowded place with good / not great food
And the chairs were rather uncomfortable!
Very crowed
But well worth the wait
Food is excellent
They also feed you a lot of good stuff before you order, like salami, zuchini in garlic oil, garlic bread, cheeze
You get full just by eating that
The quintessential high class italian meal
if that's what your looking for there is no better place i've been to than Il Mulino- it absolutely would be my choice for a last meal! That kind of quality doesnt come cheap however, and the quarter are kind of cramped- may explain why you have to have you calander handy when trying to get a reservation
Once you get it, and you get that first smell, meet the staff, and sink your teeth into whatevere you choose, that all drifts out of memory
In a word AWESOME! Starve all day, and pig-out on the best meal anywhere
Very expensive, but the best always is
The complimentary antipasto, is a meal in itself!
Anything you order is the freshest, whether it's pasta, veal, seafood, lamb, etc
Langoustine risotto, may be the best dish ever invented
Just try to get it anywhere else
Dover sole is sublime
Rack of lamb, ditto
Any veal dish, especially chops, melts in your mouth
Seafood pasta, fra diablo, is magnificent
Sorbets, like the food are amazing
Only complaint; bills are hand written, not computerized
Combine that with poor illumination, you have to scrutinize the totals
Waiters have been known to pad the tab accidentally on purpose
That said; if money isn't a factor, go eat the best meal you'll ever have
I had the veal carpaccio (over 10 veal entries here), while my girlfriend had a made-to-order pasta dish
Both were excellent
The waitstaff was very friendly and jovial
The only complaints (minor) was a 15 minute wait when we had a 10 PM reservation and the tables are pretty close to one another
Overall, a great experience and I definitely will go back
My boyfriend and I dined here last evening and I must say I was a bit disappointed
He ordered the rack of lamb special (an ENTIRE rack) and when I asked for an appetizer for my main dish (after we had already shared several appetizers) I was told that I HAD to order an entree
I of course shared the lamb with my boyfriend, had 2 bites of my dish, and sent it away
I didn't mind the $55 pricetag nearly as much as I minded being forced to order more food than I wanted
Next time I am in the mood for Italian, I will return to Babbo instead!
Unless you know the management, go to Babbo or Blue Hill because you will not be treated fairly or even nicely at Il Mulino
While we patiently waited to be seated, the bartender yelled at us, ran out of wine glasses, made us wait 30 mins to even get a drink
We left and went to Blue Hill who sat us immediately and had fantastic service, food, and wine
If you're after upscale Italian, I've eaten at Il Mulino before and Babbo is the best
Why go to Little Italy and pay throgh the nose for ok food? Dante's has excellent food and a great selection of wine
The desserts come from next door, their cafe, and are great
In the immediate area, where Cappucino Corner seems to make things a shade more touristy than I'd like, there are several Italian restaurants making it hard to determine where to go
Trattoria Dante stands out -- I went there this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed their homemade pasta ricotta asparagus tortelloni in cream sauce with bacon
Rich and delicious
Cold antipasto was tasty as a starter, and definitely big enough to share
The atmosphere is friendly, if a bit bright, and a few sidewalk tables are available if you like to eat al fresco and people watch
Not super cheap, not too expensive -- a nice value and fine venue
I've beeng going to Dante for years now
The restaurant is a trattoria right out of Florence
The food and staff are right off the boat
I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual night out
Try the Chicken Scarpariello
YUM!
I went here tonight for a birthday dinner, my friends had been here before and really liked it
The prices are reasonable, about $12-14 for a pasta dish
I had the tortelloni w/ asparagus in a bacon and cream sauce and it was sooo good
I even ate it slowly to make it last
There were no complaints around the table about what was ordered, although I didn't like the penne w/ pesto sauce too much
Definitely a must-try
Went there on a balmy Sat
afternoon
Had a wonderful romantic dinner
The food is excellent
The prices are amazing
The ambience and service is bar none
A++++
We went here randomly because we were seeing a show at the Minetta Lane Theater
What a discovery! Reasonably priced and delicious! The seafood risotto was especially good and the prices were so reasonable!
What a WONDERFUL dinning experience

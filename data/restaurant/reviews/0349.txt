Eat like a king, the pasta is wonderful, without hastle
Friendly wait staff attends to your every need while you sit in large leather, one-armed chairs and relax
A setting that is perfect for conversation and a wine list that will keep you busy for as long as you like
This place is multi-functional
I came for business on Tueday and had to bring my wife on Thursday
A real winner
Okay, I just went to Fiamma on Monday with some old friends and we had an incredible time
Not only were we six people, we didn't have a reservation, and we only had to wait a short time in the beautiful bar
The drinks were great, the food was nothing short of amazing, as was the service
I saw so many bad reviews about the place on CitySearch, and these people obviously don't know quality
Sounds like they're used to eating at Applebee's
Someone actually said too much truffle
Hello?!??!?! Try it
You'll love it
Chose Fiamma for an intimate birthday dinner
The dining room was pleasantly buzzing with activity
The pasta dishes were excellent! The risotto was wonderful and the garganeli was fantastic (very rich!)
The meat and fish dishes were good but not as great as the pastas
Management was very attentive
our waiter forgot a dish and we were constantly checked on afterwards and treated to a complimentary dessert for the mix up
Overall, expensive but good for a special dinner
Went here on a Weds night around 9 and the place was packed
Its warm, dim, minimal and very cool
Youre pretty much guarenteed to see 'someone' while dining there
In my visit we were seated right in the middle of 3 celebrities dining separately
The food is delicious and the plates are impressive
The waitstaff is knowledgable (ask for Jeff - hes wonderful) and the wine list extensive
Dont stay safe with ordering - some of the stranger sounding things are their better dishes
Definitely stay for dessert! I will definitely return
All I can say is: garganelli -- handmade pasta quills with San Daniele prosciutto and English peas and truffle butter
You must try it; it would be worth it to come to Fiamma just for this dish
Luckily, everything else that we had was tremendously excellent: octopus, prawns, the Branzini, and the duck
Fantastic wine list
Bring your appetite!
Great food and ambiance
If you can get past the rude hostess staff, the service at the table is quite good
Great wine selection
Went there with an associate for lunch, and it was a very good one
The bread needs help as does the spread they serve it with as it was a bit unflavorful aside from the rosemary, the apps were nicely done and the entrees and dessert were great
The Marscopone Polenta was a bit rich for me, but tasty none the less
Service was fine and not overbaring
Overall a very pleasant experience that I will gladly repeat
Do you self a favor and check it out
Like some of the other reviewers, I was also there for a birthday dinner with a table of 4
Our waiter was attentive, not overbearing
The sommellier and manager were friendly and enhanced our overall experience
We also got the happy birthday on the plate and I thouht it was a nice, subtle and classy touch
The timing, service, taste and ambience planets were aligned on this night
While it's a pricier night out, it was well worth it
I recently took a friend for his birthday
I found the service to be overbearing and intrusive
The wait staff makes it virtually impossible to have a private conversation, which is a shame because the room was relatively quiet
I excused myself from my table went downstairs to inform the hostess that I would like to suprise my dinner guest by recognizing his birthday in a very understated way
They recommended writing Happy Birthday in chocolate on his dessert plate
I agreed
However when I returned to my table the waiter immediately came over and said So I guess we are celebrating a birthday here
That would be ok at a restaurant half the price but my check was over $400
for two
This I feel makes it inexcusable
Dessert aririved with the writing and a candle UGH!
Went to Fiamma the other night and it was amazing
Fiamma provides delicious Italian food, a wonderful ambiance, impeccable service, and an overall great dining experience--all without appearing to try too hard or being pretentious
Out of a party of five people, none of them had anything negative at all to say about any part of the night
As a matter of fact, they couldn't stop raving
All agreed it was some of the best Italian food New York has to offer
Top it all off with perfect
perfect Torta dessert
And, while you obviously go for the food, it's the service that keeps you coming back
My father asked the busboy if he knew the final score of the Yankees-Red Sox game
The busboy said he didn't know, but moments later, our waitress approached us and told him the score
Enjoy
The food was good, service was very attentive, although they try a little too hard (interrupt a lot)
The place is absolutely gorgeosu, but the wine list
come on, we dine out a lot and even at Le Cirque you can find a decent bottle for under $45
This place had 90% of the wines costing 3 figures, and not because they were wonderful wines, but because they are overpriced
(Believe me, we know)
However, make sure you save room for dessert
they are heavenly
Fiamma was FABULOUS
Some of the best service in town
My waiter attended to our every need without being intrusive
The decor was sexy and elegant at the same time
The pastas were all homemade and delicious
The fish was a fresh and very tasty
All together Fiamma had it down, everything was perfect from the moment we walked in to the chocolates given to us with our bill
My boyfriend took me to Fiamma last night and it is my new favourite restaurant! Right away, we were offered drinks and I got the highly addictive Fiamma cocktail, a delicious, seductive raspberry concoction
Then after being guided through the menu by the cute and smart waiter, our meal just blew me away
Scallops, kobe skirt steak, pasta with peas and proscuitto, strip steak, to name the highlights
And dessert
and the vin santo
it was all too good for words! Everyone must try this fabulous italian hot spot!
I was refered to this hot eatery by a friend of mine
my expectations were more than met
First we were warmly greeted by the attractive and witty staff
The upstairs lounge is beautiful
take time to have a drink there first
Great food, outstanding dessert
Fiamma, flame in Italian is hot, hot, hot
The servoce at Fiamma is better than ever
They are one of the few places that takes care of you without smothering you

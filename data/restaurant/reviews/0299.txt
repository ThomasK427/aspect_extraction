one of the best sushi restaurants in NYC fresh large and tasty
This is the reason it is called monster sushi
Not only is this the best but one of the most carefully prepared and colorful presentations I have ever seen
The Park avenue roll
the inside out rolls and shumi bites of tasty shrimp with special sourses my favorite
If you get the chance don't miss this one chace the monster at three locations and get caugh
You will not regret it
Thank you Monster sushi John P Meiden
The slices were definitely big and I can't deny it's good to get large servings
But the fish itself wasn't anything special
I've had much better sushi elsewhere many times
good if you want a quick sushi lunch, but nothing worth writing home about
Great value for sushi
Very fresh fish, large portions, and interesting rolls
Ambiance is a little lacking, but for take-out, you can't do any better than monster sushi
You can't beat Monster for the price, quality and overall value
Pieces are big (hence monster) and always fresh
How many times have you been to a sushi restaurant where you got a nasty piece of fish that was chewy? I've been here about 40 times for lunch mostly, and never got a bad piece
Its also a bit cheaper than other places
This place equals to and rivals the big sushi places
The only downside is its a very functional place
That means no ambiance at all
I still recommend it for a great meal
In Short This is a big, garden-variety sushi interior with a small, semi-circular sushi bar up front and big windows facing Hudson Street
Despite the suggestion of the name, the cuts of fish at Monster are no more massive than those at a handful of other popular sushi restaurants around town
For those who aren't in the mood for fish, there's a wealth of other items (127 savory dishes in all) to try
I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times
this one is definintely my least favorite
The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud)
not worth it; visit the other ones for real monster sushi goodness
I went there with my friend last saturday
first it took us a long time to find the place
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece
My roommate and I LOVE this place
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me
Indoor was very cozy and cute
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good
While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
Staff is very accomodating
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious! Very good service and very good prices
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service
Killer Sushi!
I've been to all the monster sushi's in NY and have never been disappointed the quailty is always excellent
The staff has taken care of all my needs to make this dinning experience one of the best
My clients love when I suggest this dinner spot
An the size of the sushi is what makes this a monster deal with out the monster price
Keep up the goodwork guys
Authentic Parisian charm
Great neighborhood bistro food
Wine list outstanding
Excellent and friendly service
Music on Thursdays
I just Love this place !
The food, wine, and service were fantastic
Frere Jacques is a diamond in the rough
I have been here several times and have had a great experience each time
The last time was at the end of June for my Nana's b-day
We got a delicious bottle of wine, a great meal and a dessert sampler to die for
You have to top off your dinner with the dessert sampler
The chocolate cake is warm and out of this world
The apple tart is good and the banana bread is yummy
The owner Jacques and the waiter Bernard made my 80 year old Nana feel super special by singing Happy Birthday to her without us even asking them to
She was so happy and so were we
Merci Beaucoup
Very pleasurable evening! Went with a large group of 7 ladies before a show, and the staff was extremely obliging, even when one person was late and we had to wrap up her dinner to take to her
An authentic French, with a charming atmosphere
Prix-fixe menu was great and the starters scrumptious
The service is very friendly and professional, but the quality of the food is just not what we expected seeing the generous rate in citysearch, the appealing menu and the quite high prices
We ordered a chick and a pork entree, but ended-up with a chicken leg and a slice of gamon on our plates
It was actually quite good, but definitely over priced for what it was
We are so happy we stumbled across this beautiful little gem
Not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler
This means we can dine out with junior and not have to sacrifice our love for great food
Great wine and beer list!
Dined for first time here on Tuesday
Splendid
Food = Very good; Wine = Great ($52 for a 1989 Chateau Simand); Service = Excellent
Friendly and professional
Seemed like I was nearer the Seine than SoHo
I'll be back
The Scene Anne Rosenzweig's restaurant represents a PR company's nightmare, a place so conceptually ambiguous that even the people who work there are loath to pin it down
Wicker chairs and tribal-looking masks suggest Northern Africa, but the overall aesthetic is noncommittal enough to invite free association
The Food The food isn't any easier to categorize
The menu changes weekly depending on the whims of the kitchen, and its latest version feels as English as it does Mediterranean, as French as it does regional American
The aim appears to be toward accessible comfort foods, and earthy flavors are a constant
Not surprisingly, the results are as mixed as the menu
For every simple winner like Newport steak with pistachio salsa verde, there's an overconceived braised lamb with cinnamon, olives and cilantro or a meek salt- and pepper-crusted shrimp with citrus slices
Strong desserts finally make a stand, though--just enough to make you hope for the future
Arrived around 9:30 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was about 1/4 full
The staff was very warm and friendly and you could tell the crowd was local
Very unpretentious, laid back vibe and very welcoming
Ambiance was inviting with candlelight and eclectic minimalist decor
I ordered the cod for dinner and it was very well done - good flavor and complimentary side dishes
Waitress kept coming back and refilling our drinks and was very warm and friendly
This is a great, low key date place and we also noticed a jazz bar just down the street for an after dinner option

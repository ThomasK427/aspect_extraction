I go back more often for shabu shabu which keeps me warm in cold season
My BF wanted to try Korean for his 28th bday, so we chose this based on Citysearch reviews
After seeing a dingy sign and two bums begging for change at their door, we had some trepidation, but went in anyway
Glad we did! Great deal for all you can eat BBQ
$23 a person, grill it right there
The meat keeps coming til you feel like you will explode
Short tables tho, my knees are sore
I always check out bathrooms too, and this one was clean and actually smelled nice
Might be fun with a group, altho there are only a few tables! Would go again!
They bring the fresh fresh raw meats and vegetables right front of you
It was pretty busy cooking and eating at the same time, but I had a wonderful time here
The food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy
The place was packed on the night I was there (Thursday), but it's worth wait
For $20 you cant go wrong
The food is fresh and delicious
The relaxing and lively atmosphere make it easy to just sink into your booth, and grill away at their melt in your mouth morsels of meat
All you can eat special is only on weekdays Mon-Thursdays, wasn't very crowded on a Thursday night when I went, surprisingly
But can't hurt to make reservations if you know you want to go
This may become a weekly habit for me!
This place offers the incredible service and food
We enjoyed ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ very very much
The meats are so tasty!!! You won't find anywhereelse where offers this much volume for just $20
I'm very happy to find this place
Thank you John
Went to this place on a weekday and it wasn't packed at all, made reservations but it wasn't necessary on weekends it seems
My boyfriend and I went for the 20 bucks all you can eat and I must say the meat is very tasty, we kept eatting till our waists gained 2 extra inches! I would definatly go again
the bill came out to $108
00 but thats only because we drank $60 bucks worth of saki! otherwise the price is very reasonable! I definatly plan to check this place out again!
I and my friends had a party at Yakiniku Juju and Oh My God! What an experience we had that night
We tried All You Can Eat BBQ, and I can't believe that we ate so much meats, but the food was so tasty that we could not stop eating
The dipping sauce was really good, I kept dipping and dipping and
We probably had 4 or 5 rounds, then a smaily pretty waitress told us Are you giving up? They beat us, men! They took and gave us a free photo, at end, a wonderful tasty refreshment tea and candy was another warming attitude this place has
You have to try this place
The service and food is one of the best!
good food, good service, and a really weird interior motif, coupled with the occasional bon jovi in the background make for an interesting meal
some of the appetizers were so-so, and the seats definitely did a number on my knees (attempting to cross, smack
ouch), but still a good time
all i can say is all you can eat
woo
The food is just ok, but the service is slovenly and the setting just about as unsanitary as is possible for a Japanese joint
I really don't see what the fuss is
Yes, the all-you-can-grill is a bargain, but one can get much better BBQ in nearby Koreatown for little more, where the self-grill takes place at a well ventilated table
On the night I went to Yakiniku Juju, my plate came first wet, then streaked with grease; the waitress brought the wrong beer, smeared the grill with pork fat despite our having indicated that some in our party were on a kosher diet, and the music was recycled three times
All together, a rather unsavory experience
Dark and dinghy -- avoid this place
I've been many Korean bbq restaurants, but here I found an ultimate place offering all you can eat bbq for $20
02
Tasty marinated short ribs, sirloin, pork, chicken, and fresh vegetables are so Yammmy
The dipping sauce was so great that I couldn't help myself but asking what the ingredients are
Absoulutely this place is the best Asian style BBQ in the city
This place is tiny, but very cozy with upbeat service and solid price
I and my wife live aroud the corner and last night we tried the ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ
The meats, especailly rib was just perfect, spicy pork was so tender and yammy
We ordered 3 more plates, and we were sooooo satisfying
This tiny but cozy place is super cool
I and my friend had ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ last night, it's a deal of the century! Surprisingly it's not a buffet, but they serve a fresh meats and vegetables right after you order
No wonder it's so fresh
I definetly come back again
Hey, finally the summer is coming and it's not a bad idea trying bbq
This place serves a spicy marinated pork, chicken, and shirmp, are perfect to give may body a kick!
In Short Spare yet colorful, the room suggests not so much an Indian restaurant as a restaurant that just happens to be Indian
A small bar and a counter along the open kitchen invite solo grazing
The left side of the menu features "street food"--tasty kebabs and crunchy snacks
Main courses range over the Subcontinent, from Kashmir to Cochin
The decor is pretty and the food was average, but the service was not so hot
I was annoyed that they would not honor a gift certificate
You can find better Indian food on 28th and Lex
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know)
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring
I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb
If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance
The wait staff is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better!
Mirchi seems to be predominantly N
Indian, but it seems to do a pretty good job with the Keralan dishes
Mine, a fish curry, held a lot of depth and complexity of flavor, and ingredients were clearly fresh--great for summer
It's prices are mid-range and perhaps not the best bargain in all of Manhattan (less expensive, high quality exists in the 20's, eastside) -- but for the West Village location, it's not too poor
I also rather liked the decor: it's cute, spunky and stylin'! (An earlier reviewer maligned the puke green walls
It's more a pleasant split-pea soup color
) My only complaint was that it was so empty on a Sunday evening that the numerous hosts and hostesses had to focus all their people watching on us
The restaurant does a great job of pacing the meal--never any hurry
Overall quite a pleasant dining experience!
I hadn't been here before, but went with friends who had warned me that the food was really spicy
They were really embarassed afterwards, as there seemed to be a new menu, and the food was uninspired and bland
The portions are small in that upscale sort of way, as are the prices, but the food isn't good enough to warrant the rep
Great food  Excellent service  Complete meal is a great value for money
I mean a Tandoori lobster for just $19 and great martins
Plenty of people talk about this place, it's cheap but in reality you get what you pay for
The $5 martini's are badly made and watery, the free snacks are horribly oily and have been sitting there for hours
Probably a good place if you're already half trashed
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention
While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique
The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time
Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained
I love the b/w posters of famous Indian actors in the prime of Indian cinema
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good
Try the tandoori salmon! Wonderful! I have never had anything like it! The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta
The rice portions are gnerally small- and the vegtable of the day- you get 2 teaspoons of it! the 3 of us were there for hours- at least 3- well after we were done eating- and no one bothered us, it was great!
the drinks are great but theres better indian food to be had elsewhere

Its our Sushi home! The delivery is always perfect and they even throw in extras sometimes for fun
They are very quick and have never forgotten anything
There are a ton of sushi places in Grammercy and there is no place else like Hamachi, the service is great, the place is so clean and its so peaceful
Everyone is always smiling there!
The menu is very extensive and the sushi is super fresh
This restaurant has the largest variety of rolls and appetizers that I have ever seen
If you like Tomoe and Mizu try Hamachi
I love it
The eel melts in your mouth
i recently decided to cut out meat from my diet and imagine my relief and joy when i first came here
tastes great, tastes healthy, prices are reasonable
This place has such yummy pizzas with different healthy toppings and types of crust, including whole wheat for us Atkins people
Last night I had whole wheat crust with soy cheese, pesto, sundied tomatoes and roasted garlic
mmmm
Also, the spicy Sicilian slice is fantastic
The Scene Warm light, a bustling bar and arty photographs of Thailand make for a welcoming introduction to one of the most popular Thai restaurants in New York
The service is so gracious, you get the feeling your waiter would be mortally offended if he made a mistake
The Food Holy Basil's extensive, traditional Thai cuisine is several notches above its competitors
This is a good place to deviate from your standard pad Thai order: Try the melt-in-your-mouth steak salad, the mixed-seafood red curry with pineapple or any of the dishes containing the restaurant's namesake herb
Vegetarians will find plenty of fresh options, and everyone should finish with a bowl of fruit-infused rice pudding
Holy Basil this very Trendy for Location and the food itself, not a typical Thai food but it was very TASTY
and Yummy the Duck spring rolls is very good the BBQ squid salad is delicious and spicy
and for Entree
try the famous Duck w/ basil , the Fish is beautiful plated
The service was Excellent and friendly
I always enjoy having dinner there for past 10 years !!!  It is very Romantic Dining
I've been to Holy Basil a bunch of times and love the food and ambience
but the hostesses are NOT accommodating
The last time I had dinner there I did not have reservations so she split our party - but there was an empty table next to ours
I was livid
she didnt treat us like customers b/c we did not make reservations, but more like she was doing US a favor
but hey its nyc and customer service is not a priority here
Make reservations or they will be rude
Favourable reviews here drew me to Holy Basil
Service is impeccably polite and fast, with servers hovering unobtrusively nearby just when you need them
However:  1
It is so dark, the server offered a flashlight to read the menu (which btw does not show prices, but maybe I simply could not see them)
2
Tried two simple dishes from the vegetarian menu: Pad Thai and Mixed Vegetables, a Thai salad
The greens were lovely, but were smothered by an overly sweet and pasty peanut dressing
The Pad Thai had an acidic overtone - obviously the chef had been liberal with the limejuice
The Mixed Vegetables (mainly broccoli and string beans) came with a water-thin indifferent sauce

I am sorry to say that the food is below average, though nicely presented
Net/net, the restaurant is perfect for a clandestine rendezvous in dim candlelight
More and more lower east side restaurants are surprising me on taste and value
Holy Basil serves up traditional Thai food in a comfy, ethnic setting
The overall restaurant is not too large, you have to walk up some steps to get to its second floor setting
The food is amazing! The crispy duck is one of my favorites along with the pad thai
Duck rolls, stuffed mushrooms and various other appetizers are great to try
The shrimp croquettes I would stay away from
A decent selection of wine for an asian eatery alongside standard drinks
One of my favorite Thai places this is one to try
This place is great any time
A real diamond in the rough
Reasonably priced with excellent food
Great to go on a date or as a group and just order a ton of dishes and try it all
Took my parents there last night and they had never had Thai food before and were blown away and loved it
If you go, have a Thai Iced Tea for me!!!
This was my 1st time trying THAI food! and i love it NOW~! This is a great place for a romantic date, or out with a bunch of friends
the atmosphere is dark and cozy
Make sure your make reservations, cus they are busy on the weekends! Def, Def try the shrimp cakes for an appetizer
they are out of this world! Full of flavor, from sweet, to spicy, and all in between! I was not happy with my entree
the description in the menu was not what I got
so be sure to ask your waiter before you order
Overall very good food and service! :) would def like to try this place again
This place was so friendly and accomodating
The Food was delicious and very affordable
It's quite small but it's very intimate if you're on a romantic date!!!
I just went here last night w/ my friend
The food was really good, and the menu was extensive
The portions were more than enough
The setting was nice too
I will definitely return
Holy Basil is a GREAT place to bring a Thai-food loving date
Atmosphere is quiet, dark and romantic, with stained glass, beaded chandeliers and cozy candle-lit tables
Highly recommend Beef satay (grilled flavor, served with typical peanut sauce and cucumber salad) and pork ribs, (marinated in a fragrant and tasty garlic sauce) for Apps
For mains: crispy duck (full of spice - delish) and chicken massaman curry (the best I've ever had - more flavor and kick then most massamans)
Pad Thai was average
The service was 100% on-point - friendly and attentive, while unintrusive
The $4 Thai beers also added to our enjoyment of the meal
In summary - this Thai restaurant is a winner! I've eaten at several Thai restaurants in the city and will definitely dine at Holy Basil again in the future!
Keep your eyes peeled because if your not looking this one is easy to miss
Once found though Holy Basil is quite a delight
To keep it simple lets just say that the dcor was warm, great for a date, and the food was delicious
I have heard people complain about service but when I went there I had no problem in this category
If you like curry dishes they have a good selection, and if you dont like it really hot they have two tiers of intensity
Go and enjoy
the decor is beautiful
i love the traditional french presentation of the dishes
the service is very polite without being the least bit cold, and they do the best gai mamong (chicken w/ cashew nuts) i have ever had! granted, it's a bit noisy
but bring a group of friends, and be the ones making the noise!
Everything is generally tasty, especially the crispy duck
The decor is kind of goofy (brass and green) and looks borderline suburbia theme restaurant
They get really busy here on the weekends
Holy basil is a good Thai place
The cripsy duck is excellent as is the pork with green beans
Though the portions are served in a cyclindrical form (and look small) they are actually hearty in size
I have returned a number of times and would continue doing so
Ambience was good

I had the beef carpaccio with arugula, which was so tasty
The gnocchi with bolognese was a great choice for primi piatti
The wine was fabulous, and they brought us some shoestring zuchini (addictive) and bruchetta that was just great
The waiters were funny and friendly and I just cant wait to go back!!!
Finally a bit of Italy in the West Village the heart of New York
Antica Venezia is a place to bring your loved one(s) on a special occasion
The room, the wine list, the menu and service are all first notch
The presentation of all dishes was, in each case, a work of art
And yes their service can teach every restaurant a few things
Our glasses never got empty, yet no one hovered
Just can't say enough about this great little treasure of a restaurant
Truly elegant and peaceful Restaurant
Can't wait to go back
This is A Must, Fabulous Italian Food, Service and Price
Antica Venezia is such a treat and always consistent
Staff is trained to be very attentive and oh yeah, the food rocks!!! I had a dinner with a friend from Europe here, and her opinion was superb as she compared it to her experiences in Italy
The room is Romantic with two fireplaces and a great view very quaint, this restaurant is simply marvelous, I've never had a better experience
TRY IT! YOU'LL THANK ME
The Scene Small groups of friends and dating duos squeeze into this tiny, candlelit West Village storefront, sipping wine and chatting over the din
Servers swerve about the room, narrowly passing through two-top tables, bringing baskets of bread and hurriedly taking orders; it's a cozy spot in spite of the bustle
The Food The American bistro menu is brief, yet includes a good range--seafood, pasta, salads--of options
Start with the plump mussels, steaming in a fragrant red curry-coconut broth, or the surprisingly good, ultra-tender, chili-flecked baby back ribs
Salads, including a lemony, crunchy apple and hazelnut mix, are bountiful enough to be shared
For dinner, best is the grilled salmon over polenta and dotted with warmed cherry tomatoes, but the scallops, strewn atop lemony risotto, and the NY steak-and-fries are also quite good
For dessert, the upside-down pineapple cake is tops
we happened across this restaurant by chance
we had an 8 pm show at the cherry lane
initial service prompt/friendly
we both ordered the striped bass
the food arrived and a 1/3 of the way through my meal i realised that two-thirds of my fish was uncooked
i sent it back
minutes later my plate was returned having been microwaved
i continued eating and saw my date picking around her fish
a large portion was uncooked
she said not to worry as she done
i still notified our waiter
we declined desert, my date had coffee
the billed arrived, $28 for each entree for a total of $56 for uncooked bass, twice!!! total bill $83
you would have thought that they would have comped one if not both of our meals, offered a desert on the house, a drink
nothing, not even an apology
they should be royally ashamed
I went to Alexandra with a friend who lives in the neighborhood
My experience was much better than most of the reviews: food was very good (giant, delicious pork chop); attentive, if casual service; prompt delivery of food and wine; very nice wine selection (if a little pricey, but more under $40 are available than prior reviews would indicate); great dessert
All in all, I can't think of a better place to spend a cold February Wednesday night
They should have a big sign saying cash only though, because I had no idea until the bill came
We ordered a round at the bar, a McCellan 18 on the rocks for him, and a captian and coke for me $35
00 total
We were promptly seated at the worst table in the place
The restaurant was offering a $70
00 Price Fixed Menu which included a four course menu and champagne
We, only were given 3 full courses
Coffee not included
During the night, we ordered 3 bottles of wine, (none offered under $40
00) 1 Gin and tonic, and one cappucino
Our bill came to $480
00, which included tax and a 20% Gratuity
Our waiter was pushing us all night to take our plates, and swiped my dessert before I was finised with it
The staff wanted to get the tables cleared out so they can have an after party
they should have offered two seating times for dinner
5:00pm and 8:00pm
and offered only bar service after 10:00pm
I recently had lunch at Alexandre
A beautiful fall day, sitting outdoors I had the Cuban Sandwich
very authentic! I'm bringing friends to dinner here this weekend
There is a sembalance of distance and disfamiliarity that is prevalent in the bistros in Manhattan, none such here
The service and food were both excellent!   =
I ate here for lunch and the look and feel of the place is quite nice for the west village
I ordered the steak lunch special wrap and was disappointed for it for the amount it cost
It was 16 bucks and was about as thick as a half dollar and very oily
The presentation of the food is good but the quality and quanity for the price wasn't there
I also ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm at best
There are plenty of other better places to go to in the west village
That is EXACTLY what this lovely space, service, and food allows one to do
A true sit down, enjoy bottles of wine with your friends or loved one, drown in conversation kind of place
Do not go to rush
Why would you want to? This is Manhattan- Live and Laugh
To the others whom left reviews about the slow service, RELAX!!!!
The food at Alexandra was very good, however, the wait staff needs to be much more professional
For one, please offer the specials prior to taking our order
Also, we were only given wine by the glass options when we asked
Which, after 6 glasses added up -especially at a cash only establishment
Apparently, we now know bottles are available but we weren't given the option by our clueless waitress
The ambiance in the restaurant was nice, with one exception -that being a very loud server who talked the entire time
One of the things she discussed very loudly was how much she made in tips that night
Which made us, and the table next to us, feel uncomfortable
Again, the food was great, but we are waiting to dine again at Alexandra in hopes that the manager makes some sorely needed staff improvements
A crowded noisy space with inattentive, hurried, service posing as a quaint West Village bistro du jour
The bartender ignored us for 10 minutes before asking what we'd like to drink although we were the only people waiting for a table when we walked in
The food was very good, but the waitress amateurish and seemed hassled by the idea that service was a part of the equation of dining in a restaurant
She forgot to bring our dessert, after sitting with coffee for 15 minutes
We cancelled and she apologized but too late
I waited 2 weeks to write this in hopes of forgiving a new neighborhood place I really wanted to enjoy, but after due consideration, wouldn't ever go back
Sorry!
alexandra is a fabulous addition to the neighborhood - a cozy, friendly spot to enjoy some yummy comfort food
nice soft candle light and a pleasant buzz in the room
we've dined there twice now and both times the owner welcomed us, helped us with our coats and then as we left followed us to the door to thank us for coming
now THATS service! we'll be back again and again
A charming, small restaurant - very casual
Went for brunch where there is a wait if you come at 1
The kitchen is then reeling from that and it took us 40 minutes to get our brunch entree

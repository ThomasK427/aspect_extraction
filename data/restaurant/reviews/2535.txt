The food was all tasty and satisfying
The large salads were great
(The burgers, delivered to others, looked good)
It's a pleasant, comfortable room
The bill came to around $75 (with four drinks)
they must have a new chef! wait staff woefully inept
turkey dinner inferior to tv dinner
lobster ravioli tasted more like chicken of the sea, not at all like lobster
perhaps that's why dining room was 75% empty on saturday night
this place is terrific for a bar grill
as a non-meat non-chicken eating person the usual menus of bar grills are limited for me - not this one!!!! i do eat seafood and the choices were wonderful
very rarely can i find two or three choices on any menu - here there are about six or seven items that looked appealing
i ate the lobster salad, baked artichokes and mashed potatoes - all recommended
i cannot wait to go back and try some of the other menu items
if you are on the upper eastside - try this place!!!!
We have eaten here countless times and the place is always excellent in every way
When the weather permits, be sure to sit outside, although the interior is cozy and charming
The service is outstanding and attentive
We are addicted to the roast chicken and the caesar salad with chicken, though you can't go wrong with anything you choose
A wonderful find on the upper east side for lunch or dinner
All I can say is my husband and I eat there atleast once a week
The goat cheese salad is to die for!  Everyone is really friendly and the atmosphere is great!
Willy's is a nice way to spend a meal outside
The food is delicious, especially the salads
Service is friendly too
They do not accept credit cards here - which we found out in a pretty embarrassing way, but other than that - we LOVE Willy's for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner
The pasta with eggplant, pear salad and egg dishes all are great
It can get very crowded on a sunny Sunday morning - so try to go at a less crowded time
Good Bloody Marys, too
i've never before had such fresh guacamole! and the fajitas also were excellent
my friend and i stumbled upon this place and now are exhorting everyone to eat here
the only negative we note is being charged for extra tortillas for the fajitas-- they come with only three and three definitely are not enough!
This is a lovely, cozy, civilized place in which to escape from the chaos of the city
The prix fixe menu is reasonably priced and has a nice, varied selection
Very romantic place for an intimate dinner for two
A must for Anglophiles
Lovely romantic getaway -- this carriage house is everything that OIBL, TIBS is hyped to be but isn't
King's Carriage House is intimate romantic with solid cooking, a well-thought wine list (not overpriced -yay!) and good continental service (solicitous but not overly friendly)
The tables are close so you can hear every conversation going on around you, but if you're here with someone who enthralls you, you will notice no one else but your dinner date
While the food was very good, the setting is the bigger draw
Try to get a table in the front room of the second floor - the red walls are stunning and passion-inspiring
Second choice would be the back room on the first floor; it is a little chilly in winter but puts you instantly in Europe -- reminded us of a great little restaurant in Prague called Blue Duck
One of the most delightful jacket tie dining experiences on the Upper East side
The decor resembles a stylish English country home; the service is unobtrusive yet attentive
The food is understated perfection: beautifully presented on very hot plates, every dish we tried was a superbly balanced collection of complementary flavors
Very strongly recommended - and at current prices extremely good value
Our friends have been imploring us to try Kings' Carriage House, so we decided to celebrated our wedding anniversary there
And are we glad we did! Now we know why others call it a gem! From the moment we walked in the door to our last reluctant sip of port wine, we were transported in time and space to the old world charm of the English countryside
My starter of grilled shrimp and vegetable terrine was surpassed only by the perfectly grilled filet mignon with melted Stilton
My husband's medallions of venison were truly outstanding
We had little difficulty picking a wonderful Merlot from the extensive wine list
And the ginger brioche bread pudding was a sweetly befitting end to a marvelous meal
It was simply a wonderful meal and anniversary all the way around
The Kings' Carriage House is the crown jewel!
I adore this place, it is a hidden gem, it makes you feel as if you have traveled through time to an old english country house
This restuarant was a warm welcome on the cold rainy night that we had gone
Like dining in an upscale New England Bed and Breakfast - the floors creak and you feel as if any minute, Like a Bewtiched Episode, Benjamin Frankilin may stroll buy with a cup of mulled wine
The service was tight and the welcome was quite warm
The food was eloquently prepared - not a feast for those with huge appetites - but quite tasty nonetheless - my only suggestions would be to have a bottle of wine instead by the glass which were 12 dollars a pop
The Prix meal was perfect and a very memorable romatic evening all around
Not sure what those other reviewers were getting their panties in a knot over - they must be from out of town :)
Once upon a time, this was my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan, and possibly the world
Marino, the owner and chef, was warm and friendly and welcoming, not to mention his talents in the kitchen
Once you had been there a few times you were treated as family
Then tragedy struck
After a few months without a visit, I stopped in and was shocked by the change in food quality
The menu was the same, the servers were the same, but the food was not
I learned that Marino had sold the restaurant complete with name and menu
Sad as it is, this is now just an average Italian place in an out-of-the-way neighborhood (for this Chelsea chick, anyway
) Wahhh!
We received a coupon and after reading the reviews we tried to place our order
The owner told us we are now called little prince and that coupon is no longer valid (extremely rude) and he hung up on us
We promptly called again and said I don't know why you hung up we wanted to place an order regardless
This man was very rude and unprofessional and I would not recommend going and or ordering
I can understand changing names, owners but regardless you are never rude to the customer
Who cares if the coupon is no longer valid we simple wanted Italian food! This comes from someone whom's family owned restaurants and I think the whole thing is questionable
Yes, we were lured in by the coupon for 3-course dinner, $23
99, all the wine you can drink
Well, fabulous, but it took almost 45 minutes to get seateddespite visibly empty tables, and later arrivals being seated more quickly (they put the waiting people in different areas then forgot the order of arrival)
When we were seated, we had to catch waiters and busboys repeatedly for each and every course
And forget about the wine, we managed to get a few glasses when we could grab someone to bring them
The food was OK, the wine was OK, but the staff seemed to find us invisible
I went here for a bridal shower a few weeks ago, and I don't think anyone was impressed
The place is cute, but the service was awful
We should have had the entire restaurant, but the manager let some random lady sit up at the bar because she was a regular
The food was not that great either
The manager was extremely rude to everyone
I would not recommend this place at all
Just abismal service
Pity, since the food is not half bad
The staff was inattentive
We received our requested water at the same time as our check
Still not sure who our server was
They also charged us for Salsa and hot sauce
The food was not bad but not great or worth what we paid
I would not recommend this restaurant there is better Mexican in the neighborhood
Some friends and I ate here and had a terrible experience
We paid $7 for a teeny portion of completely mediocre chips and salsa
The white wine sangria was terrible and tasted like margarita mix
In general the food was bland, even when we requested it spicy, and not particularly fresh

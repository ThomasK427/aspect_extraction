Great fresh pastas and reasonable prices with a homestyle italian feel
Wow
Out of the restaurants sprouting on Smith St
this one stands out
The food is lovely: a delicious radiccio and mescun salad with lemon dressing, caramelized walnuts and gorganzola
The Gnocchi were light as a feather in a earthy ragu sauce with plenty of basil
My S
O
had a whole wheat pizza that converted me
Very nice, fresh, light, white wine sangria, sippped out on the airy wooden deck on a late spring evening was memorable
This is the closest to Italian pizza I have ever had! You cannnot find better pizza unless you go to Italy
Amazing!
I cant say enough
Great food
great price and beautiful family feeling
It's every bit worth the 40 minute drive for me!!!   The nutella pizza is to die for!   dont miss this one
Interesting menu; excellent preparation served in a cozy familial atmosphere; genuinely attentive, personable ITALIAN staff
Second time we travel from South Jersey to experience a taste of Itay
Well worth the trip!!!!!!! We'll be back!
What a fabulous place! This pizza is so good (Watch out Grimaldi's, there may be a new Pizza king in town)! The entrees were also delicious - and what a sweet waitstaff
Love the photos too! I am definately going to be a regular
Good call CityGuides!
This is a great place
I loved the pasta and the piazza
The service was wonderful
You must try it
There are many italian places in this area
But, the PIZZA is superb here
The wait staff, all authentic italian, is wonderful and helpful with questions you may have
The best part is definately the pizza that the old italian man is working on in the back
Worth a try!
Four of us ate here and all had an enjoyable and delicious meal
We ordered the lamb, ribeye (a bit fatty but very juicy), t-bone, and filet mignon and everyone's dish was cooked just right and very tasty
The Greek way of seasoning--olive oil and oregano--is decilious and flavorful, and a nice departure from other steakhouses
The creamed spinach was thankfully not over-the top creamy and the calamari was crispy and juicty
Waiters were very attentive
Nice winelist
Desserts were good, not amazing, but we were so stuffed and satisfied we didn't really notice
And the ambience is suprisingly nice for a steakhouse
The food is great and the staff is so friendly
the wine list is excellent and very carefully discerned
The Scene You'll have to knock to enter this hidden dining room, a luxe windowless space featuring four wall-sized murals depicting famous landmarks throughout the seasons, as well as a handful of finery-laden tables
Diners are, as a rule, a subdued lot, but the oh-so-formal servers can be cajoled into loosening up without missing a beat
The Food In stark contrast to the slabs of beef so common in the downstairs dining room, this kitchen is capable of playful, smart and quite precise cooking
Take the foie gras "club" with green apple on thin, small white bread squares: It's a refreshingly irreverent way to serve the foie, and it works
And though many menu descriptions seem almost intended to make diners skeptical--wild salmon with tangerine jus and black olives, venison with Brussels sprouts dressing and lamb loin with red curry-pea shoot emulsion--time after time these dishes shine
For anyone who enjoys good food, excellent beverages, superb service, and a refined atmosphere, 21 Club cannot be excelled
21's managment clearly refuses to compromise any of the standards and methods which have made that establishment the premier eatery for almost 100 years
Bravo 21! I only hope that you continue to set the benchmark for another century
The Scene With its wicker sidewalk tables and floor-to-ceiling French doors, Tournesol brings a Left Bank flair just this side of the East River
Inside, it's a typical, tin-ceiling floor-through bistro, with a service bar to one side and matted Art Nouveau prints on cheery yellow walls
Local workers and curious city folks fill the long banquettes, nibbling on tiny olives and charred, chewy bread
The Food If you had a Gallic grandmother, this is how she'd cook for you
Friendly French servers (who think they speak English better than they do) describe the reasonably priced menu and daily specials: Nothing's too elaborate, but most everything is fresh and satisfying
Skip the frisee salad--the lardons, egg and croutons are over-cooked--and dive into a rich, thyme-heavy duck liver-Muscat pat, offset by sweet, caramelized chutney
Wine-braised beef cheeks are comfort on a plate, as are crispy-skinned roast cod, creamy cauliflower gratin and grilled scallions
Vanilla-flecked creme brulee is outstanding
I have been going to Tournesol for years and they never disappoint
The hangar steak and garlic chicken are pretty amazing for dinner
The brunch is some of the best in the city and there is rarely a wait
which I am sure will change soon
Wonderful small french bistro that feels like home
I recently went there w/5 others
Excellent reviews across the board--of note, Appet: snails--succulent and not overwhelming, breaded goat cheese french salad--satisfying and pleasant, fresh green salad--satisfying w/a walnut oil vinegar dressing
Main: Hake fish on a bed of beans--amazing, beef cheeks--tender and delightful, hanger steak w/frites--solid
Prices are reasonable
It is great to have a place like this in LIC
Leaving Manhattan can often mean leaving behind great food and ambience steps from your door
This place rivals any bistro in the city
I would add more mirrors, but change nothing else
The quality of the food goes beyond traditional bistro fare
The fois gras with fig is fantastic
This particular night, I ordered the lamb shank special served with polenta (a much better choice than mashed potatoes)
People from the neighborhood: support this great place
Manhattanites: take the 7 train to Queens - its worth it!
I love Tournesol
I have been for dinner and brunch and am never disappointed in the food or service
Both are outstanding
I just wish the space could somehow double, because it is so crowded! My boyfriend and I decided to go there at 10 on a Saturday night, and it was pretty much full! The crowds speak volumes about this bistro
it is consistently wonderful
No one can stay away!
Authentic french bistro
Ran by very friendly people (authentic french as well!) who make you feel like home
The foie gras is a God sent, as well as the steak frites
Try the cassoulet in Wednesday!
Brunch is amazing, eggs benedict, croque monsoir, mussels-Ive been so many times I can't count and have loved everything-this place is not yet the scene of Pastis but the food is much better, all in a cozy, friendly atmosphere
I love this place!The food tastes good and is not expensive
They have a good wine list
The staff is great and professional
good foie gras, great steack frite, affordable price, a little bistro like they are in small town of france with out the NYC arrogance  Bravo Bravo
The food at Tournesol is authentic home-cooked french fare with a flare
The presentation is creative and the atmosphere couldn't be warmer
And the crme brle is the best I've had outside of Paris
Be sure to arrive before 8pm as it tends to get crowded on virtually every night of the week
I live two blocks away and have been to Edwards exactly 2 times in 5 years
The wait staff ARE NOT nice
Where the heck are you people sitting???  Both times I went with men and the bitchy waiting to be discovered waitresses and maybe gay male waiters didn't give me the time of day
The food was good, but trust me, unless you want attitude, I would walk across the street to Odeons
Edward's menu is definitely better than their neighbor's - their fries are very very good
Burger with blue cheese is excellent

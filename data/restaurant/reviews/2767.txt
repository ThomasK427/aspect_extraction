Been there twice
Once on a date and once for a private party
Both times dissapointed
I ordered the paella with chicken
The rice was dry and the chicken was so chewy it was more like gum
I was chewing so much that I decided that I had to swallow it somehow even if I didn't want to
that's how disgusting it was
Staff just shrugged
The private party was for a sweet 16 niece of mine that ended up in tears because everything went wrong
This place is a disaster, I don't know how people have rated it so well
Maybe I was just unlucky
In my experiences, the staff could care less and the food is inedible
With so many great reviews, we expected a sure thing
But, after an hour and a half of frustration - Arrived at 8:00, with a reservation, waited 30 minutes
- Two margaritas, one frozen one on the rocks
They were pre-made, laced with sour mix (first sign of a bad margarita), and weak
- Finally seated in the garden room
Tried the sangria, it was ok
- Seated for one hour, no appetizers, no water, no drink refills
- The inept service waiter brought our appetizers to the table next to us
He wandered aimlessly, asking who ordered what
- All the couples around us, who were seated after us, received their appetizers, but we were somehow forgotten
- It was now 9:30, we were starving and pissed
We just walked out, they never noticed
- Thanks for ruining our Saturday night; you just lost two would-have-been loyal customers
I dined in the Main Dining Room which is surrounded by authentic Spanish decorations
We were served guacamole which was prepared tableside
The main dish was perfection! Overall--this Bay Ridge restaurant is a classic
I attended a private party at Casa Pepe
What a wonderful time we had
The ambiance was wonderful, food excellent, service superb
If you are in Brooklyn, it is well worth the trip to Bay Ridge for this gem of a restaurant
I visited Casa Pepe last week and I couldnt be more impressed
The bar staff was very attentive and professional, and the drinks were perfect
I requested the romantic indoor garden dinning room and was seated right next to the roaring fireplace
The staff was courteous and explained the menu with detail
The appetizers were amazing, and the main course was delicious
My wife and I enjoyed our experience and we will definitely be returning in the near future
Casa Pepe is unquestionably the best restaurant in the Bay Ridge area
Food is great and for the price its even better
Service was very good
Worth a visit
Margaritas perfect, service perfect, food great, I have no complaints
Try the Paella and the Chicken francese
Casa Pepe deserves even more then a ten! Really
Its a great place we keep coming back to
Next time I'm making my reservations at Casa Pepe for New Years
My family and I went out to a terrible place and spent the whole time wishing we were at Casa Pepe
Casa Pepe has it all, the food, the service and the atmosphere
You can bet we'll visit Casa Pepe soon again!
Order a few margaritas, a few appetizers, a paella for two, and you are bound to have the perfect date! Or at least that is what my wife and I do every other saturday night at Casa Pepe
We keep coming back for the great food, friendly service, and the good time
I don't understand why this restaurant is not listed in Zagats
It has to be the best restaurant in Brooklyn
My family and I always go, its hard to get everyone to agree to try another restaurant but when we do we are always disappointed are return to our favorite the Anorme family loves CASA PEPE
Trust me! I am a lover of paellas and margaritas and nobody makes either better than this place
Their fireplace is cozy and the enclosed skylit garden room is the most romantic, even in the dead of the winter
We had a wonderful wedding party at your place
Thank you Mr
Jimmy for organizing our event with us
Love Tina Greg
we'll be back with 10,000 balloons next time!
Every time we visit Casa Pepe we dine in the skylit garden
For dinner it is always psecial to sit by the fireplace
What could be better than sipping away at margaritas and sangria in such a romantic place
order a paella valenciana for two and you're set for the night
The Scene Twenty dollars buys a feast at tightly packed and perennially busy Gia Lam II, a divey Vietnamese spot, popular with families, lunch breakers, and afterschool teens, in the heart of Sunset Park's Chinatown
A friendly staff works the room, delivering favorites like crisp, crackling spring rolls and shredded pork rolls wrapped in rice paper
Pho tai, Vietnam's great comfort food, arrives with plenty of rice noodles and thin strips of beef
The food is decent but the service is not all that impressive
Gia Lam I' s service is not much better but the food was
The peking duck was quite a pleasant surprise (esp at half price during weekdays)
Unique dishes like razor clams make this a favorite destination for my family
Unlike Chinatown Manhattan, parking is relatively easy
Dinner is definitely worthwhile
Don't let the decor deter you
While dim sum is not too pricy, but there's definitely better dim sum elsewhere
In Brooklyn, on 61st street, try out Jade Palace
And Most restaurants in Chinatown's dim sum beat out Ocean Palace by a mile
Can take upto 30 mins
for seats, usually during weekends 10am-12pm or holidays
Lots of waiters hanging around so you will have no problem ordering from the kitchen or getting a cup of milk tea or coffee
Wide range of dim sum and food
If your of non chinese ethnicity or don't know the language, your better off going with a friend who does, because theres usually different variations of dishes from the kicthen that you mite prefer
Best Dim Sum In New York
Excellent food and service
great family environment
kids love it!
it is the best dim sum restaurtant i have ever encountered
When first I visited Ocean Palace, it customers wre over 90% Chinese, and the food was authentic, not for the Anglo tourist trade
I sought no changes
As more caucasians learned of this wonderful restaurant and demanded things like Chinese noodles and rice with every dish, the restaurant attempted to comply
It is still 5* dining to me, but not as it was when first I succumbed to the delicacies of their cuisine
Unfortunately I now reised in Albany, NY, and my visits to Ocean palace are far too limited - but should anyone visit the Capital Region of New York, we have Emperors, which is much like Ocean Palace, and has suffered the same deterioration due to an attempt to please the caucasian visitors
Everything tasted very bland
The seafood did not taste all that fresh
It was probably due to the lack of business
I was there on a friday evening and there were only 1 other table
So inexcpensive that you'd wonder about the sanity of the owners, if they weren't such good cooks
Classic dim sum is served by a helpful waitstaff, who gladly identify each rich delicacy for the novice -- and there's plenty of delectable shrimp dumplings and pork buns, if you really are that unadventurous

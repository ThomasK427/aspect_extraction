The chocolate tasting plate was a nice finish
Our waiter was friendly and helpful
Looking forward to returning for another special occasion
although i went to aquagrill for the highly acclaimed food (which definitely lived up to its reputation), i was blown away by the phenomenal service
attentive, informative, professional, and friendly, the restaurant staff truly is first class
unbeknownst to the three of us, the hostess made note of the fact that i was celebrating my b-day after a member of my dinner party made a very brief reference to it as we were seated
following our delicious meal, she had a special order dessert with candles sent to the table without prompting - truly classy
as for the food, the flavors are subtle and well-orchestrated, the fish is unbelievably fresh, and the raw bar is as good as any i've seen in the city
also, the crowd, even on a wed evening, is a great (and surprisingly good-looking!) one
It's only recently that I've developed a taste for seafood at all [aside from sushi]
But Aquagrill made me feel right at home trying items that were new to me
The fruits de mer royale was tender and high quality; the cauliflower-and-peekytoe-crab soup was great too, and so was my companion's skate which I tried as well
And our waiter was a champ, taking the seafood newbs through all the different choices without blinking
The only change I'd make might be to remove a couple of tables from the floor -- at $100 a plate, I don't want to be squashed
I can't imagine how anyone larger than me would feel
But I'd still highly recommend this place for a special occasion to anyone, whether you think you like seafood, or not
I just finished my dinner at Aquagrill and have to say that it was one of the best dining experiences of my life
I read the reviews posted here on City Search before going down so I of course ordered the Cod Special which is not to be believed
Everything people said about it was true
but you would not believe just how good it tasted until you actually have it in your own mouth :) I had the lobster/avocado salad for and appetizer and that was divine as well
Service was perfect from the hostess to the bus boy, to the manager and of course our waiter Tedd
A truly pleasurable dinner that I hope to repeat again soon!
I have eaten at all the best restaraunts in the city, from Jean Georges, to Baltazhar and was so excited about hitting up Aquagrill only to have one of the priciest poor meals of my life
WHat are you people talking about- the place is stuffy, snobby, and attracts a not so exciting crowd, and the meals were absolutely BLAND- I don't know how they made a delicious sounding special of Striped Bass with all these yummy acoutremants taste so completely lifeless and unfilling-but they did!- and there signature dish of salmon crusted with falafel was equally poor- skip this, save your money and buy your own fish at the market- I promise it'll somehow come out better! They wouldnt even let us move our lcation when there were other tables open and we were next to the kitchen!
Aquagrill lives up to it's billing
Incredible selection of oysters
Excellently prepared fish
Cod wouldn't normally be my first choice, but I went with the Truffle Mushroom Cod and was delighted with it
A must try! The accompanying spinach fish is excellent
The complementary amuse-bouche and petit fours are great touches
Plus, its kind of cool to get something complements of the chef
Slow, but very polite and accommodating service
Hey, if you have more than two words to say to the person across from you, then a little wait for great food is a small price to pay
Speaking of which, Aquagrill can get a little pricey, but it's not exorbitant
Excellent wine list as well
must try the appetizer crab and scallop terrine
great seafood at reasonable prices
waiters are helpful and friendly
location is a bit odd, but it's worth the trip
The oysters were absolutely amazing
They were extremely fresh and I had fun trying a few of Aquagrill's huge variety
Our server, Jennifer, offered excellent suggestions and was quite corteous and unobtrusive throughout the night
We never felt rushed (spent over two hours there)
I had the warm octopus salad, which went very well with the Herman Weimer Riesling
It was tangy and refreshing
The truffle mushroom cod was the best fish dish I had ever tasted in my life! The texture was soft and fluffy, and it seemed to melt in my mouth
The tastes were overwhelming and delightful
My girlfriend had the sea bass with these lobster stuffed squash things (a special that night)
I thought it was a bit too buttery, but otherwise very good
The lobster things, however, were amazing
I think Aquagrill should consider adding them as a separate appetizer item to their menu
This is where my boyfriend and I end up on special occasions and when we want the best seafood in the city
The prices are surprisingly reasonable
It is romantic ,everything is fresh and delicious, and the service is white glove
Run here! ps Make reservations
For anyone who truly loves seafood, Aquagrill is a must visit destination
The selection and quality of oysters is unmatched anywhere in the city, hands down
The service was attentive and informative, even down to serving an appetizer in two portions from a single order - not something you see often in a bustling nyc restaurant
Oh, and order the mushroom truffle crusted cod, its unbelieveable
The Oysters here are so good
Come just to try them, and West Coast are sweeter right now
The truffled cod with spetzl was so good, thanks for the recommendation! Be sure to call for a reservation!
Been there twice and it was delicious each time! Definitely get the truffled cod
Great service and atmosphere too!
Truffled cod was fantastic! Oysters were good
I wish some place in the city would have descriptions of the oysters
I never know what to get or remember what I like except the Kumomoto
Service was slow at the end
It took forever to get the check and to order dessert
I loved the amuse bouche and the cookie plate at the end
Touches like that are 1st class all the way!!
Nice selection of raw oysters
Staff was very polite and attentive
My boyfriend introduced me to this place and it's wonderful! The food just melts in your mouth the wine is wonderful, and the service always there to answer questions and offer suggestions
We always recommend this to friends
The mushroom truffle crusted cod was buttery and tender
The waiters must have just dived for the oysters because they were so fresh
The service was considerate and efficient
They did everything right
Very nice place for a special dinner
Very fresh fish--we loved the warm shrimp cocktail appetizer and if you're more adventurous, the octopus salad
The cod dish entree is also very good, and anything with risotto
The simple fresh grilled fish is also something you can't go wrong with
The atmosphere is cozy, and romantic
great place for a birthday dinner or any special occasion
Definitely recommended
Best seafood I've had in NYC
Oysters were cold and fresh
Service was great
All of the courses came in a timely fashion and not too quickly
Order the scallops entree
the risotto is heavenly
Heavy on the pockets but I will definitely be back
Went here the other night with another couple after not having been there for about a year
I'd venture to say it's even better than it used to be
We were greeted by two very nice hostesses and seated promptly
Our waiter was practically perfect - knowledgable about both the specials and as well as the entire menu
Importantly, he didn't rush us
All four of our meals, we agreed, were outstanding
By far the best and freshest oyster selection I've found so far in NYC

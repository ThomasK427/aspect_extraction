The eclairs are just as good- for an extra 50 cents, you get bittersweet milk chocolate on top that perfectly complements the vanilla cream inside
A must try on a shopping excursion down broadway
YUMMY! the choux shells were crispy, the filling was not too sweet, and the vanilla was PERFECT
Somebody PLEASE open one in Houston!
You must to try it and you'll fall in love with their puff forever! The vanila cream is soooooooo delicious
not too sweet and you can even see the vanila seed! And puff is just perfect!
These little puff pastries are sooooo addictive
You would think they are heavy, but they are soo light and not too sweet
Just perfect
I highly reccomend the vainilla ones
The Scene Low, beamed ceilings, French doors that open to the sidewalk, brick walls and candle light make for a cozy scene
A mature crowd unwinds in the quiet and relaxed dining room or in the back garden
Outdoor seating in front allows customers to witness East Village foot traffic
The Food The menu features Italian favorites, most served with an ample portion of cheese
Light, lemony meat ravioli is garnished with shaved parmesan; a prosciuotto di parma sits on a salty fondue of scamorza
Even a hollowed out wheel of pecorino becomes the main attraction for the namesake dish, which translates to "cheese and pepper
" In a tableside flourish, waiters toss homemade tonnarelli inside the wheel's cavity, creating a creamy coating for the pasta
A cheesy theme also pervades the dessert menu, with offerings like olive oil gelato in a parmesan basket and mini cannolis stuffed with coffee flavored ricotta
There were 6 of us for MOthers Day
5 pastas were not al dente, they were undercooked
4 pastas were oversalted
We requested penne and tomato sauce for my 3 yr old and we asked for it with the appetizers
Instead, we received spaghetti 10 minutes after all the other pastas were received
My son could not eat the meal as the salt content was higher than anything I have ever tasted to the point that it was removed from the bill
The main courses were good
I have never been this disappointed in a restaurant
I keep going back and it keeps getting better and better
The Gnocchi melts in my mouth
Good pasta in general
Great everything
Wine, staff, desserts, coffee
Very comfortable as well
The service was professional if somewhat slow, though we didn't mind since it is such a welcoming place to have dinner
The waiter recommended a satisfying wine and we enjoyed our food immensely
Have the kitchen split as an appetizer its signature cheese and linguini pasta that is curled in a large round cheese bowl that look like a giant candle right at your table
Went here for my birthday, and the food and service were great
One of the best meal I have ever had
The food here is more than Italian peasant's food, so if you are not willing to experiment or are expecting simple, common Italian food, this may not be your place
If that does not bother you, this is definitely a place to go
The food is sensational and the entire experience was great!
This place is truly a gem
I went with my friends a couple of days ago and we had a great experience
We didn't have a reservation but we were seated right away even though the place was packed
The food was AMAZING and the atmosphere was great
The food at Cacio e pepe it's really a step above all the italian restaurants in the east village
Two thumbs up!!
I had a date on Valentine's Day at Cacio e Pepe
They had a special pre-fixe menu
The food was great and the ambience was romantic
The staff- although attentive and helpful with wine food selection- did confuse who ordered which dish
:) Still, this place is definitely worth checking out
a great place for a date!
I had dinner with a group of friends at Cacio e pepe last Friday and it was incredible
The food was great
They only use the best ingredients(ask about the pasta they use) and the presentation is pretty
The place had a great vibe that night and all of us had a great time
We will definitely go back
We waited 45 minutes for a table that was contantly just 5 minutes away, while we watched two groups of equal size (also w/o reservations) get seated at great tables! We finally were seated at a table next to the bathroom, kitchen, wait station, and bar
A server brought us a bottle from a younger year than we ordered, I asked to see the wine list again
He loudly complained about this to our waiter, the barkeep, and the owner
He had the gall to say that the wine's year makes no difference!!! At this point we left, and explained to the manager our reasons
He waived us off, while the barkeep and server lied about their rudeness
The owner was incredibly rude, unapologetic, and obviously could not have cared less about our negative experience
Do not reward his rudeness by frequenting this place
Authentic Italian in a nice environment
the servers are friendly, but can NEVER remember who ordered what
they come to the table calling out the dishes in Italian and you have to try to guess if it was what you ordered
but I would absolutely recommend it anyway
They are new and probably working out the kinks
Try the Cacio e Pepe dish or the quail with blueberries
The entrees are fantastic too
I've had the duck, the steak, and the ox tail and loved both! Great wines and desserts too and different specials each night
This place is amazing
The food is great - really creative
The prices are good and the service is friendly and knowlegeable
After going for dinner a few times, we realized they were also doing brunch - out of this world! The brunch menu is as creative as the dinner menu
The wine list is also quite extensive
My favorite Italian
Have tried the oxtail stew, veal tornedos (wrapped with procuitto), and quail and have enjoyed them all
Good portions, bold flavors, including the sides which are as good as (if not in some instances even better) than the mains
If they have the roast potatoes go for it! Ditto the garlic baby broc
Desert of green tomato strudle with basil sorbet was more interesting than savory
Gets a bit noisy when full though
Terrific new restaurant
great service coupled with nice wine list and food that makes you mouth water for more the next day
Splendiferous desserts as well
nutella will melt in your mouth
In Short Brown rice-paper lanterns, draped canvas and cheesecloth and knobby ropes dress up the joint's standard-issue tables and chairs
A large backlit bar lends a lounge-like feel to the room
The restaurant serves starters such as edamame, pork dumplings and tempura, plus sushi bar favorites nigiri, sashimi and rolls
The draw is the daily dinnertime two-hour, all-you-can-eat sushi ($19
95)
Diners can pair it with the all-you-can-drink offering of Sapporo, sake and well liquor ($25) for balance
I was a little worried the first tiem I went there a few months back with the all-you-can-eat sushi
After trying the special I was not disappointed nor rudely surprised
That being said a friend of mine had his birthday party there recently and it was a great time
Our relatively small group of six had quick and pleasant service
The non-sushi eaters had the teriyaki (chicken and beef respecitvely) dishes that looked great and tasted great according to them
The beef was a little red on the inside which was good and made it very juicy
The mixed drinks we had were strong and friend of mine was really buzzed after only three drinks!  THe tables are situated not too close to each other so there was a level of intimacy/privacy there

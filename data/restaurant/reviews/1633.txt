94th and 2nd Ave
They have a delicious sauce!
Great pizza, Better than Lombardi's
However the pasta is not as tasty as Carmines from 93rd St
I would recommend getting pizza than pasta
However, it's a fun place to dine and hang out with friends
A little pricy for the pizza
A large pizza with 3 toppings came out to 20 bucks
Tasty, served HOT out of the oven, tasty rolls, friendly service, pizza was not quite as flavorful as Lombardi's but the crust was chewier and better (not burnt)
this is clearly one of the top pizzas in NYC
I was really excited about this place because it looked affordable, and the food options sounded great, but had a very disappointing visit
Our waiter brought my food out about 20 minutes before my friend's, and I had to have my calzone reheated because it was literally cold
We barely got an apology from the waiter
I'm going to stick with Grimaldi's Pizza in Brooklyn Heights- they don't have the variety of Patsy's but at least the service and the pizza are top-notch
The waitstaff was friendly enough though
But the food was mediocre
I've been to the patsy's near 30 something street
This one just doesn;t compare
My brick oven pizza was soggy, it suppose to have a crispy crust
The pizza tasted something like something from your local pizzeria (though not bad, wasn;t expecting it) There was lots of sand in my pasta with clam sauce
Overall a bad experience
Although NYU isn't too far away from the restaurant, you don't see college students eating there
Its a family-casual yet sophistacated restaurant
I went during the daytime when it was less busy and so our waiter was very attentive
The pizza was very delicious
But i wouldn't recommend anything else
Maybe the salad
Never have I been to a place quite like this
Where else do you go and feel like you are back in the days of the Honeymooners? They play old school music and have dishes you remember back in the days when you parents took you out to eat as a child
A flood of momories come to me when I sit and eat in this place with my friends and family
Simple one of the best
On a scale of 1-5 for spiciness, this was a -1 -- bland and flavorless
and how can you mess up rice? Hillarious lighting and ecclectic side dishes make you want to love the place, but the meal on the whole was abyssmal
We go to this place often for Indian food
The prices are cheap (about $6-$8 for most entrees), the food is great, and the service is always friendly
There is the added bonus of it being a BYOB, so plan ahead if you go on a Sunday and want to have wine with your dinner as the stores won't be open to sell you any (not yet, at least)
I have been going to this place for years and there food is incredible
It's cheap and good!!! And yes, it's great to see what happens there when someone has a birthday!!!
This is the worst Indian food I have ever eaten
If you want food this cheap and are capable of dining outside of Curry Row, please go to Baluchi's
Sure, its a chain, but the food will look and taste above average
HOWEVER, if you must go to Rose of India, go with someone having a birthday or hope that someone is having one
The waitstaff turn on some version of techno music, turn down the lights to highlight the disco ball and clap quickly -- without singing
Its quite fascinating
The waiters here are fantastic
Especially Yoichiro
He makes killer drinks
The sushi is pretty cheap free, though the portions are kind of small
After ten there are two buck pints of kirin or something, that's pretty cool for the village
And the waitresses occasionally hit japanese giggly mode which totally cracks me up
Like many village places, the patio is a little ridiculous though
I had a craving for noodles, and my favorite joint was closed, so I tried Zen
I had an excellent bowl of ramen with miso broth, full of scallions and very flavorful
My only complaint is that there was only a VERY small piece of meat in a $8 bowl of soup, but I guess that's 'authentic
' I also had a spicy tuna roll, quite fresh and satisfying
ACTUALLY spicy, unlike many rolls with lackluster flavor
I will certainly go again
The 50% off sushi is an excellent treat for anybody into cheap and really good and tasty sushi
They tend to have all sorts of specails, and a lot of Japanese cus
which really speaks volumes about how good the food is
This is my favorite sushi restaurant
I must have eaten here like 50 times in the last few years
The sushi are always fresh and delicious, and most importantly, not over-priced
The people are friendly and knowledgeable
They serve standard fare, so none of those neo-sushi or monster-sushi stuff
In Short In a small setting on East 9th Street's Japanese row, diners can watch soba and udon noodles being cut and hung to dry
Noodle bowls are mixed with tempura vegetables, mountain yam, mushrooms, or spiced with curry or cold citrus dipping sauces
Fried appetizers, tuna steak and other dishes are also available, as well as an assortment of sakes, graphed on the menu according to flavor components
I went to Sobaya last night for dinner
The place is clean and waiters very courteous and attentive
The noodle portions are not bad and the soup flavorful
Definitely try the little side dishes
The uni was very fresh
The prices are also not bad at all
I've been to other noodle places that were double the price and so clean/organic tasting (more like tasteless) that I left totally unsatisfied
I enjoyed Sobaya and would return again
ive been here a bunch of times and ive always left happy
its inexpensive (soba/udon dishes range form $8-$13) and very filling
the soba noodles are fresh, and if youre lucky, you can come to see the chef make it from scratch
soba comes either hot or cold (i prefer cold) and with your choice of tempura, a variety of dipping sauces, or raw fish
they have daily soba and udon specials as well
appetizers (especially the soba sushi) are interesting and varied
afterwards, they serve you hot soba broth (its basically the water used to cook the soba supposedly, its nutritious) to finish your meal
the rice dishes, notably, the unagi-don (eel on rice) are also very good
service is attentive for a busy restaurant
desserts are mild and light
try a few of their unique ice cream flavours such as honey wasabi, yuzu (citrus), or black sesame
i love noodles and eat them about four of five times a week
this place is a great introduction to noodles for those who have not yet become addicts
it has more of a nod toward ambience than other authentic noodle joints have
but of course, what really matters is TASTE and soba-ya delivers
the noodles are hand rolled and cut
(there is NO RAMEN here: udon and soba only
) broths are savory and well balanced
no exotic toppings to scare off novices
a fine introduction to staple japanese noodle eating
I've been to Sobaya only once so I won't be overly broad in my praise but it was a good dining experience, reasonably priced (about $20 per person including tea, entree and dessert, which was $5)
The tempura and negimaki soba were delicious
You really should try the yuzu, honey wasabi and green tea ice creams
(I wasn't such a fan of the black sesame

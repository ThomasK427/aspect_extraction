this restaurant had the rudest service i've ever experienced ( i'm a native new yorker!), it's amazing people even bother going back
not only did the host forget we were on his list to be seated
but when we approached him to ask nicely how much longer the wait was, he was rude did not even apologize for being a flake
then on top of that, the ditzy waiter had an equally obnoxious attitude
he forgot our coffee which we ordered once we sat down, until we asked for it again mid-meal
he also had the audacity to act rude, as if the customer did something wrong
meanwhile we were tolerant nice the entire visit
he's lucky we even tipped him- the bus boys did more work than he did, he barely lifted a finger to even remove an empty plate from our table
Cafeteria used to be my favorite hang out spot for chicken and waffles at 3 am, the warm brownie sundae and the great cocktails
Then to my horror exactly 2 weeks after my last meal there, they stopped serving their SIGNATURE dish, chicken and waffles!!!!! AND they don't serve breakfast at night anymore
Who on earth was in the meeting where they said 'wow we're doing such great business-let's ruin it'
I refuse to come back until they bring my fave dish back
If i can't get the dishes the place is known for, what's the point of still going??
This is exactly the type of place that makes me HATE New York (and New Yorkers) these days
It's all about attitude, attitude, attitude
Oh, and looking good
Our service was HORRIBLE
They slapped our main courses down before we barely finished our starters
They brought out water for a DOG before we had to go INSIDE to get more water
The host talked to a friend for 5 minutes before greeting us
They never checked to make sure we were happy
I rarely undertip, but this visit warrented a 10% gratuity - and I'm sure the waiter just thought we were being cheap
HARDLY!! Everyone I've talked to about this place agrees about the service, but goes anyway because of the scene
How gross
Why don't you all stop being so fake and realize this place is so 80's, it's over
No place has maddened me more
then you should go to the bar at Cafeteria!  The service seems to think it's a little too cool for school, so have some patience
But the Cosmos are some of the best in the city (some argue THE best in the city)
They're expensive, but very yummy!  Food isn't so bad, but a bit overpriced
It's insanely crowded these days; so, I'd eat somewhere else and then come here for drinks
February 11: First, We were told by the Host that there would be a 30 minute wait for a table
That wait turned into an hour when he sat his friends (twice) who just walked in
He had no explanation
Second, the kitchen took forever to get our food out
30 minutes between appetizer and main course
the only two good things of this place - good ambience and great drinks
besides that its nothing amazing
the food isnt great at all
Service here can have it's up and down moments, but has gotten better over time
The food here has also improved over time
The mac and cheese is great and the spinach salad is great for lunch
Cafeteria can not be beat late at night when lately it seems the city that never sleeps has been Bloomberg'd to deep slumber
Reservations seem to be overlooked and a matter of practice not use
Located in the growing and bustling residential Chelsea neighborhood, Cafeteria is far from a cafeteria
Faux Models/Waiters hustle around the tight spaced restaurant, while the bar is crowded with waiting patrons and dates enjoying a drink
There is usually a wait, no matter what time of the day or night or wee hours of the morning
Reservations are accepted, but not for very large parties! The food is ALWAYS consistent and the prices are more than reasonable
After numerous tastes, I have yet to be disappointed
Great place for a date, meetup with friends, or a small party
Avoid Cafeteria if you cannot shout above loud music or are conferencing with a client
During the summer, the garage doors open up for streetside dining
A downstairs seating area exists, but if you're there for the ambience, don't venture basement-bound!
Chelsea is often praised for its supposed plethora of restaunts offering excellent comfort food
I have yet to find many of them, but who needs them when there's Cafeteria
The cool, minimalist decor is anything else but homely, but the food certainly is
Mac Cheese, cobb salads, a variety of sandwiches and burgers are all standard fare and are all excellent
Service is swift yet polite and the bill is generally reasonable
Best of all though is the restaurants unfailing reliability, a quality missing in many other fashionable eateries
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the friendly waitstaff
The food was prepared well and tasted very fresh - AWESOME meatloaf, hanger steak w/arugala salad, crab cakes, etc
NYC waitstaff and hosts can be such snobs - but these folks were really nice and welcoming
It got a bit loud at times, however, and the food is a bit pricey considering it is comfort food
But, it's still good eats!
It was a FUN place for lunch
Service was fine
I always try and make it there for lunch eveytime I hit NYC
Maybe it was a fluke, but I had a great experience here! The host was really friendly and apologetic about the wait but seated us promptly
Our waiter wasn't bitchy at all!  I didn't have any, but they have the most amazingly adorable drinks with plants floating in them!!
Great environment and it's 24 hours
The food is great too
This is my favorite late night place to go
Get whatever you want to eat, but remember to keep room for the extremely delectable Waffle Banana Split Sundae, the waffles are fresh made and the ice cream is amazing! It will make your visit worth while
Group of 5 for Sunday brunch
Were told the wait would be 35 minutes - actually waited over twice that (smaller groups were seated much quicker)
Steak eggs is on the menu, but they were out
I got eggs benedict - muffins needed more toasting, hollandaise was watery and flavorless, home fries were just plain potatoes (no onions, no peppers, no discernable spice)
Two in our group got hamburgers which I was told were also disappointing
Appetizer never arrived, even after multiple inquiries
I was offered a refill on my coffee, but that also never showed up
I'm surprised the editorial review compares the decor to Asia de Cuba, because I really liked that place - Cafeteria's stark white UPS brown I found unpleasant
If you're seated on the inside right next to the sidewalk, be careful of the ledge
At least the host provided some decent eye-candy
I love this place!! Excellent Food !!! Great service
Beautiful people everywhere
Alot of artist, actresses and models
Intriging atmosphere
Invite your friends to eat and lounge
Sort of makes you feel like your in Miami on Ocean Drive
Mac and cheese is TO DIE FOR, along with FRIED CHICKEN and WAFFLES ! Took my Dad there for his 50th B-day and he was feelin' it
GO THERE !!!
Late night this place is stocked with some of the cheesiest denizens of the nightclub scene: people who wear sunglasses at 2am, double park their Hummers and dress like Christina Aguilera
We were told 30 minutes, waited 60, and watched late arrivals seated before us
Host's explanation was Maybe they know somebody or something
I've eaten here for breakfast and dinner and it's always been mediocre
Bah
Never again
FOOD WAS OK,SERVICE NOT SO OK,WAITED FOR THE CHECK WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING,WAITED FOR CHANGE,WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING
BE CAREFUL,THE TIP IS INCLUDED IN THE CHECK,I CAN THINK OF MANY OTHER PLACES TO EAT BEFORE THIS ONE, BUT ITS GOOD TO HANG AND GREAT PICK UP SCENE
Trendy atmosphere, white couch backs servers dressed in black and white, in a garage
Good first date place

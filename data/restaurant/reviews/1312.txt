Their Paella is great! They're a bit pricey, but not extreme
I joined Citisearch so that I could share my experience at this dump
If you're looking for a food review, move one
After passing the place many times, I decided to bring my girlfriend
After showing up at 8 pm for an 8pm reservation, I was told that it would be about 15 minutes until my table was ready
Fine
About 30 minutes later and no movement detected, I asked the hostess again when I would be seated and she said, I swear to god, I really don't know
I asked her what happened to her 15 minute estimate and she said I don't know
I despise places that are busy, so they feel entitled to treat people as cattle and this is clearly one of those places
Do ME a favor and don't give these amateurs a dime
Thanks
It is not a Cuban Restaurant
For those that do not know what Cuban food taste like it can be o
k
for them
I am of Cuban decent and my mom's cooking puts Azucar food to shame
They have an Italian chef tryig to make Cuban food
Service is horrible
Waiters take your order and you don't get your food for at least 1 hour so you can prchase drinks
Food comes out cold instead of hot from the kitchen
The only good thing in this restaurnat is teh little band thy have playing which makes teh whole reataurant
So those amatuers that rated this so high need to recognize! This is an Argentian run restaurant not Cuban run! Nice decor poor food poor service
The food is pretty good, but the mojitos were stellar--I drank watermelon martinis like they were fruit punch all night long
There were lots of large groups in the restaurant, and all seemed to be enjoying themselves
Ask for a table downstairs if you don't want a very loud Cuban band in your ear all night
The vaca frita and empanadas were the best
Overall, a fun, festive place
I went here for my birthday and had a wonderful time
They serve the best Mango Mojito I have every tasted
The Lobster tail in the pepper sauce was very good
My friend had the seafood cassrole which he loved
The atmosphere, the decor and ambience just makes you want to go to Havanna
Highly recommended
Being Cuban, I wanted to find a Cuban place where I could feel at home and I did! I went with some of my college girlfriends for the first time tonight and it was probably the best time I've had in the city
The food was great (try the ropa vieja!) and the people were great
The music was definitely the highlight of the night though (go around 9pm)
The live music makes you want to get up and dance and everybody did! That is what I love about being Cuban
It's all about having a good time
It does get really hot since the place is so small, but it didn't matter
Everybody is there to enjoy themselves
I HIGHLY recommend going there with friends if you want to eat great food, laugh, and dance
Cuban people are the best and Azucar gets an A+ in my book!
I just had dinner here last night with a group of four
The food was okay nothing spectacular
I got the salmon with sugar cane glaze but it was more like sugar cane syrup
VERY sweet! If you get this dish i recommend asking for the glaze on the side
Its just way too sweet and it saturates the rice
The appetizers were so so
The only one we had worth mentioning is the skewers
The other 2 appetizers we ordered were forgetable
However, the chocolate cake dessert is worth getting
mmmm! Oh and the white wine sangria was also very tasty albeit a little on the weak side
And the best advice of all: if you want to have a conversation, i suggest you get there before 8:30 b/c once the band starts playing (who are excellent), it is so loud you have to SHOUT! to be heard
We went there with my colleagues for lunch
I'm relatively new to Cuban food so I liked my seafood platter although my Cuban colleague complained about her dish
In a few days I came back with my wife for dinner (no reservation needed) and ordered her the same platter as I had last time
It was different although it looked the same! Clams where replaced with fried plantains, most of fried shrimp was gone etc
Now it was just bad for the price
My ropa vieja was very average too
I think they are getting away with things like this just because of 8th avenue location and the loud cuban music they play at the bar upfront
Ok, if you are spanish I will tell you the apetizers are great but the actual main course meals are bland
Not tasty at all
The drinks are good, the service alright
Very small and crowded, been to much better places for the money
I had reservations so I was seated fast
I recommended reservations
I won't say don't go there because I believe you should always try a place a least once but the place is over rated
I had a good time there
the food was pretty good, but not the best Cuban I've had in NYC (maybe I didn't order the right dish)
I liked the fact that they served black beans with your meal
The flan was amazing, I probably could have had 4 slices
I only wish they wouldn't have seated our large party of 6 all the way in the far corner of the restaurant
We were all the way in the back, in the corner, right by the bathroom and kitchen
I felt trapped in my seat
In the summers word on the street is that they've got a guy rolling 'cubans' out front but since it's fall I guess he's back in the home land
Food here was very tastey and pretty authentic
The sangria pitchers (26) were pretty spiked but there wasn't that much fruit in the bunch of it
On the weekends make sure you make reservations and try to sit in the back as they have live music up front which will make it difficult to hear people
heard the music from outside and popped in with a friend
Didn't expect anything but the food was spectacular
They got it all right, from the rice to the beans to the fish and meat
Quality and very fair prices
Will be going back this spot whenever I'm in the neighborhood
I absolutely loved the place!! The drinks were amazing, and the food was very good as well
Went here on Saturday night before a show, my boyfriend loved it as well
It's a relatively small place and was completely packed, which is interesting considering there are a lot of restaurants that are completely empty near by
I would absolutely go here again!! I have only had cuban food twice before at Victors which I thought was good, but this place is definitely better!
Went there on Saturday night and it was quite busy and loud
The service was OK, but the food was a disappointment
Pretty bland on the whole but both our appetizer and some side dishes came out cold, not heated all the way through at all
Maybe it was just a bad night
Live in the neighborhood and just made it to Azucar last night for the first time
The food is amazing, great service from everyone who works there, they all have a smile on their face
The atmosphere is great
I will be back many times!
I just disagree with some people that go to Azucar, and expect to be treated like in a 5 stars restaurant, it is another kind, good food, drinks, and service
I had excellent communication with the waiters (very cool people)
But it's more the kind of restaurant that you go to have fun, enjoy with friends, or girlfriend, but if you don't have sense of humor, really want to have a good time, enjoy your time in there, then this one might not be the kind of restaurant for you
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND ENJOYABLE!!!!
This cuban american customer was pleasantly surprized

maryann
I had the best time there
This is a great place to eat and have fun
Go there on a Saturday night and request the singing room
There is a woman who heads up a small group of croonies
Feel free to get up and sing-a-long to old Italian favorites or Do-Wop
This is place where Do-Op was born
Little Italy in the Bronx
The food and the service are fantastic! Mangia tutti
Have been here three times
The food is always authentic and delicious! I would dare say-mouthwatering
the wait staff is attentive and friendly
If you are looking for a real italian meal its worth the trip to Bronx's Little Italy
My family and I go to the bronx all the time just to eat at Emilia's! We stumbled upon Emila's while browsing at the Feast of St
Anthony's
The first time I ate there I ordered Rigatoni alla vodka and I thought it was the best I have ever tasted
The prices are reasonable and the service was quite friendly and prompt
I give Emilia's two thumbs up!
Emilia's on Arthur Ave, I just Happened to stumble upon
I sat down for their lunch specials
i got Fried calamari, which wasn't bad
But the cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce was really good
The best part though was the best tiramisu I've ever had
Hands down
creamy rich, and not too much liquer
Only cost me $30 bucks
Hit this spot
This place has amazing wings! It's more of a Bar than a restaurant
The bar gets out of control busy due to it's proximity to Fordham University--but the Fordham kids are cool, so it's alright!
Full Moon has that certain something that the rest of the pizzerias around Belmont doesn't
It has a sense of style, a sense of purpose, and probably most importantly, they actually care about what they're doing
The pizza is great, with a crunchy and chewy crust, tasty toppings, and good value
They are masters of creativity with their pizza
Go there for a little slice of heaven
The Full Moon is New York all time best pizza
no doubt about it
Locals and visitors know all about this Arthur Avenue treasure
This is a great place to grab a slice of pizza or sit down and eat a very large meal ( all their meals are large)
VERY yummie Crispy pizza! It's isn't brick oven like the competetor up the block but it is still good
Great atmospere
After hearing so many great things about Dominicks, I was very much looking forward to eating there
Maybe it was an off-night, but I was very disappointed
We were told that the wait would be 1/2 hour on a Saturday night, which was reasonable
It took TWO HOURS for us to get a seat!! But at least the food would make up for it, right? Absolutely not
The food was very very mediocre at best
The sauce I make at home has more flavor than this! The shrimps were small and overcooked, the chicken marsala had canned mushrooms thrown on top and a sauce that was so sweet that I couldn't finish the plate (I thought marsala was supposed to be made with white wine??)
The meatballs tasted like beef meatballs with little or no seasoning
The tomato sauce was very bland
With so many alternatives in this great neighborhood, save your money and try somewhere else!
I love Dominick's and try to go once a month
Once you get a table loosen up your pants for a feast
A personal and family favorite for years, Dominick's never fails to please
The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is great (though those who dislike closeness and need privacy will hate it), and above all, the food is delicious
Try the stuffed peppers, the stuffed artichoke, and the veal marsala, among other things
Everything is served family style, there is no menu and no check (also, they only take cash)
As of recently, you can even buy jars of their homemade sauces, which make great gifts
The best tomato sauce in New York, great clams, stupendous stuffed artichoke, pasta perfectly done--This is the best Italian in the city and the only place where you can be two tables away from the governor and a movie star and only have eyes for the food
THIS IS BY FAR NEW YORKS FINEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT AND THE REASON IS THAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE BOUGHT FRESH EVERY DAY FROM THE FINEST ON ARTHUR AVENUE
BIANCARDIS MEAT STORE, RANDAZZOS FISH MARKET, BORGATIS HOME MADE PASTA ALL THE VERY BEST EVERY DAY AT DOMINICKS
I HAVE BEEN SENDING PEOPLE THERE FOR OVER 20 YRS AND THEY ALL AGREE ABSOLUTELY THE BEST AND IT IS A BARGAIN TO BOOT
If you like quiet, secluded tables hidden behind potted palms, then stay away from Dominick's
But if you are friendly and don't mind the neighbors sharing their food with you, then by all means - Dominick's is the place for you! There's no menu, no business cards, and no check at the end of the meal
Being friendly with the waiter helps, too! Be prepared to wait for a table - go to the upstairs bar and crack open a bottle of wine, or a nice bottle of Italian beer, and get to know everyone else waiting - who knows, you could be sitting with them for dinner!
For decades this clubhouse like restaurant has drawn locals the Bronx and adventurous downtown New York with it upscale red sauce platters and seafood
The last time I went the quality had taken a dive
Sauces were bland and most other dishes were just average
It's still worth trekking to the Bronx for if only for the scene
This diner (now 24 hrs on Thurs/Fri/Sat) is a great value
Standard NY diner fare with a smattering of Mexican (not Latino)
Friendly service and large portions
Consistent food quality
If you are visiting the little Italy section of the Bronx, you must stop to see the new and improved Tino's Deli
Now at a new location (2410 Arthur Avenue)they offer table seating by a beautiful travertine fire place, brick oven pizza and more
You can still find Rosa's famous eggplant parmigiana and her homemade Italian sauce
You can also find specialty EVOO's and aged balsamics specifically chosen by Giancarlo Paciullo
This place is definitly Little Italy's finest!!!
Large and doughy
Great chicken milanese
Great for the wallet
No mid-fancy pastas like alfredo (like Ray's/Famiglias) or margarita pizzas
Just old fashioned NY cheap, big parlor slices, delectable beef patties, calzones, and rolls
Pugsleys pizza is probably one of the best tasting pizza you will find within the NYC area
The food is fresh, and the ingredients are of high quality
Because of its somewhat hidden location, the pizza and all the other foods served do not get the recognition that some of the top rated restaurants receive
But believe me, once you try one these delicious slices you will not resist asking for another
If you think Joe's pizza on carmine is good, you won't think twice after trying Pugley's
pugsley's is a fordham university favorite pizza joint, located right outside the school gates
quite honestly, the place looks like it's going to crumble to the ground any minute, and is only held together by the tacky wallpaper and indecipherable home-grown wall decorations
its proximity and late hours of operation are probably the two reasons for its longevity
not to mention the proprieter Sal Pugsley, who's always High
on Love
Love is It, is the joint's motto, and it makes sense, because the pizza certainly isn't It

My GF took my there for my birthday last night, and the food and ambience of the place was really great
They had a resturant week special for $35, and the food was spectacular
The service was great, and they were very intentive
I will definatly be back
Start at the bar
The best mohitos in town
So good I have my birthday parties here
Very comfortable to get a group of people in one corner and hang out for the night
As others have pointed out: the bread is to die for
We will come in just for the bread basket alone, and a couple of drinks
(Buy the bread, get the drinks for free, ha ha
)  The dining room is surprisingly large
Service is always great
Steak is delicious
It's rare to find someone who doesn't like their dish
Enough space between tables that you don't feel crowded or that it's too loud
We're regulars, but then again we live around the corner :)
Great drink list, super friendly service
The food is great
Its a great place for a date or just to get together
I've been here a few times during the past year and am pleased every time
The food is imaginative and delicious
I'm not kidding
The pork tenderloin is a must try! The steak is equally good, especially the yuca fries it comes with
Ah yes, the mojitos are a MUST, especially the watermelon flavor
The food is well thought out and each bite should contain a little of everything on your dish for the full effect
Beautifully plated as well
Decor is of the hip, swanky variety with an atmosphere that isn't overly annoying
Try the tamale too, mmm goat cheese, corn meal and tomato sauce
Had dinner here this past weekend with some friends (5 of us in total)
The food was great and the waitress was very helpful in helping us choose from their very interesting menu
The appetizers were delicious and the entrees were superb (the mahi was a little bland, but I guess you can't win them all)
Overall, highly recommended
I have been here twice, first just for drinks, and the second time for both food and drinks
I came witih my boyfriend and we found everything to be really great - the drinks were amazing, try the sangria and mojitos! And the lobster empanadas were great! We loved it and our service was really great and remembered us the second time!
I went here 2x already and both experiences were great! Try the filet mignon or the jumbo shrimp dish
The flavors work very well with each other and will have a lasting feeling on your taste buds! You have to try out this place!
My b/f and I went during restaurante week
We had a late-ish reservation (9), but the place was hopping long past that, which made the meal fun and we didn't feel rushed at all
The waiterstaff seemed really thinly stretched, but were courteous and appologized numerous times for some rather longish waits between courses, but nothing awful
We were seated immediately
The food was very good, especially for the Restaurant Week menu price, although it seemed like the 'hits' would be the ceviche and other small dishes that weren't part of the menu
Still, good food, courteous service, and, during the two weeks in June, at least, a good value
Not sure that I would go there for the full price
Eating here was a last minute decision--and a good one! The rolls with black bean dip were unique and delicious, the food really perfectly seasoned and cooked, the atmosphere upbeat and lively, and the drinks so much fun! A real treasure on the Upper West Side
I really like Calle Ocho a lot
It's a nice oasis on the upper west side, which is all too overrun with bland brunch places
Maybe they don't have the most authentic Latin food, but I can to the far upper east side for that
;) When I'm looking for an elegant place to have an excellent meal and some very tasty and addictive cocktails with hubby or friends, this is it
I especially like the lounge area in the front
Went for Restaurant Week with 2 friends
We had a blast
We had reservations for 6:30pm, I was the first to arrive and enjoyed a refreshing Raspberry mojito at the bar
such a cool bar too, loved the seating by the window, perfect while I waited for my friends
The male host gave us a bit of a hard time because one person in the party arrived 30 mins late
That didn't rub me the right way, but the subsequent meal and service made that a minimal issue
The restaurant week menu consisted of specially made dishes for the week and between the three of us we had everything
Scrumptious! I highly recommend this place, music was great, not too loud, we easily conversed and would most certainly return
I loved the pictures of Lucy and Ricky to indicate ladies and mens restrooms
This place is great!
During my dinner experience there, every person working was fabulous
Really great experience
Keep up the great work!
On the coldest night of January,THK GOD we had reservations
When I first walked it,I thought the place was really small,but it was HUGE when you walk to the back
I had the Jamaican?Jerk Chicken
Nothing JERK about it,but the beautiful decor made up for it
The Raz Mojito is excellent (stay away from the champagne)
I felt like I was screamy most of the night since it was really loud
The bill was $215 for 4-not bad for us chaps coming from Jersey
I've been to Calle Ocho several times and it's a great has a lounge like atmostphere - downtown feel for an uptown restaurant
The appearance outside is deceptive as it doesn't look that big, but the dining room area is pretty huge with beautiful high ceilings
The food and service were both very good and they brought interesting dinner rolls that I loved that were a bit sweet
If you going to order drinks than the bill can get a bit pricey, but each time I have gone I have found it was worth it as I had a good time
I would recommend this place as a good date place
Every dollar is well spent! The ambiance/decor is inspiring and the main dining room is magnificent
Oh yeah, the food was impressive as well; I recommend the wojito!
The food is wonderful
The people are very kind and curtious and prompt with their service
The atmosphere is classy with salsa music in the background
Can be compared to Bistro Latino
I highly recommend it
Looks like a lounge in front and trendy restaurant in the inside
Server was so nice and cute too! Just had dinner tonight
I give 2 thumbs up
A little pricey but worth the price atleast
Food was tasty and the way they made the choc
cake looked even more yummy
Calle Ocho is one of my favorite places to go in that area of the city
The food is good, the crowd is hip, the drinks are killer and we almost always have a good time there
Yes, it is a little expensive and is usually loud and crowded but that is the type of place it is
You want quiet and relaxing, go somewhere else
You can't go wrong with any of the mojitos and the food is very tasty and presented beautifully
Make reservations or expect to wait
Definitely worth a try at least once
You won't be disappointed
I went to Calle Ocho the other night with some friends and it was great
As far as cocktails, I'd suggest sticking to the mojitos, they're the best in the city and they come in great flavors! The ceviches were really creative, and the entrees are massive
The service was great as well, always there when you needed anything!
I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room)

After tax/tip lunch was $24 pp
I dine at MoBay frequently at least once a week
having seen the prior reviews I thought some advice from a regular might help
The whole fish dishes are divine but on weekends they can take 45 minutes between 7 and 10 PM
If one of the diners orders fish everyone dining with him is locked into the same wait
Monday through Thursday at MoBay is heaven
For a quiet dinner I go on Monday or Sunday night or I conclude my business dinner by 9 PM any day of the week, before the music starts
I come after 10 PM on weekends and enjoy the more relaxed ambience, great bar conversation, good food and world class music
See you at MoBay Monday through Thursday
Of course if you don't mind the crowd it is very popular on Weekends and please try the ribs
This is not written to insult or offend, but more as a friendly suggestion
I have been to Mobay's several times and referred several friends and co-workers and the same comments ring true time and time again
The food is wonderful, but the service is lacking
Regardless of how tasty the meal, it becomes quite lacklaster after being forced to wait an hour or more for a jerked shrimp appetizer
The live performance could have been a nice added touch to the ambiance had it not been a blaring loud distraction throughout the meal
For such a small venue, light jazz and singing piped in lightly is all that's necessary
As much as I love to support new establishments in my Harlem neighborhood, I must say that I will not frequent MoBay's again until I feel that I can receive adequate service and an enjoyable dining environment
Food is quite average by NY standards, but the ambiance is nice and they make a nice friendly effort
Front is good for lunch (can get cold in winter), back for dinner (don't sit by the kitchen)
Overall parochial non savvy but pleasant
I've encountered early closings, closed for parties, and non-existent delivery (why even advertise delivery???) I'd recommend the BBQ dishes and cornbread, stay away from the specialty cocktails and dishes that seem inventive
But they really do seem to be nice people and mean well
I had dinner at MoBay on a Wed evening recently
My dinner partner told me that it is usually crowded on the days he goes (Thurs thru Sun)
It was nearly empty when we arrived, so we were seated promptly
Waitress was attentive
Cornbread with pineapple sauce was good
I ordered the jerk chicken and was not impressed--somewhat bland
The macaroni and cheese, while good, was ice cold
The steamed veggies were excellent
Not too soggy
The food was not terrible; just wasnt that great
Although I was not moved by my meal, my friend enjoyed his soy concoction thoroughly
I will say that what the restaurant failed to achieve with its cuisine, it more than made up with the ambience
One drawback about the music--a little too loud and the CD kept skipping
Overall an average experience, but I will probably not return for a meal
Drinks maybe
I love the environment, it gives a relaxing and at home feeling
My first time I was kind of iffy about going; but they proved me wrong
Its a great place to eat with friends or even have dinner with your romantic love
The bathroom was beautifully (I didnt want to leave)
The service can be improved though
They chit chat too much instead of serving the customers
Overall the place is a go and a keeper
I'm glad and proud to see a wonderful place as such in Harlem
Thanks!
Just had lunch there this past weekend
I was excited to try one of the new places in Harlem
I have wached theses new places move in
Along with MoBay, there's: Revival, Native, Sugar Hill Bistro etc
The service was great and helpful
But my food was definately Lackluster
Perhaps I just picked the wrong thing, but BBQ is one of the things they're known for
It was bland with a lot of sauce
The cornbread with coconut and pineapple was the best
The music was way too loud
On a Sat afternoon, most people want to chill and talk, not PARTY
I saw familys and couples tyring to connect, while the resteraunts help just talked loud over the speakers near the bar
It's great having some more choices, along with the standard Amy Ruths, Londels, Slyvias, etc, but MoBay seems to work more on it's image than it's food
Elegant! Sophisticated! Classy! Exquisite! DIVINE!Change has finally come! MoBay has brought to Harlem what no other establishment would even dream of doing
We no longer have to travel to midtown or downtown for fine dining and great food
The salmon (whether BBQ, Grilled, Pan-Blackened or Curried Coconut) is to die for! Other restaurants in Harlem and other Caribbean or Soul food restaurants are competing for the number 2 spot because MOBAY UPTOWN IS UNDENIABLY #1!
I am a regular at MoBay
You truly are provided with the best value, the best ambience and the best food, prepared to order that Manhattan has to offer in this price range and for a lot more money
You can't get better ribs in New York for any price
I am prompted to write this review due to the negative review that I just saw posted
Ladies and gentlemen do not believe it
MoBay is an extremely popular restaurant and with good reason
It's about the taste
The food is freshly prepared and if you don't want to wait, come on Monday through Thursday
Take your friends here and they will think you are a god, what else could explain your awareness of this divinely, sublime and gorgeous room serving such exquisite treats
If you want a quiet or romantic Friday or Saturday dinner come after 10:00 PM
I was part of a 6 person rehearsal dinner on a Friday evening and I hope this dinner doesn't predict how the marriage will go
The hostess who sat us was nasty as could be
We waited approximately a half hour to order drinks and it took 45 minutes to get them, when they came with our appetizers and no apology
We hadn't even finished our appetizers when our main course showed up
My salmon was dry as a bone tasting like it was just heated in the microwave
It took 20 minutes to get my second drink
When we received the bill, we asked the manager to do something about the drinks, considering how poor the service was and her reply was, Well, you got them!
They are only interested in the money they are making that night rather than makng customers or friends
SEE YOU ALL AT BAYOU!
Great Barbecue, pretty people, pretty place, cool jazz and tasty oversized martinis
Friday it's a crush to get in, better to go Monday through Thursday
The food is deliriously good and for that reason I routinely make the trip from midtown
Don't miss the St
Louis ribs or the crab cakes and the live jazz sets a sexy mood
We went there on a Sunday night
The staff was very nice, the hostess very sexy and the food tasty
Stay away from the drinks as they are overpriced but make sure you get some of the starters
All in all a good spot for Harlem although a little pricey
If you drive by too fast you might miss it, tucked away near 5th Avenue on 125th Street
The food and ambience are not to be missed
I had a great jerked whole snapper along with an appetizer platter last night at MoBay
When the food was served all conversation ceased
This food is so good it requires your full attention
The music is good and the room is fantastic
I am definitely going back soon
Don't walk run to MoBay Uptown
Great fish preparations every day
Don't miss the whole snapper run down or the curry coconut salmon

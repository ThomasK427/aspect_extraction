This well kept secret has been the cornerstone of great dumplings in Chinatown for the past decade
The restaurant features great drinks, home style dumplings (siu gaw), and their special tofu and pork dish (lai tofu)
While the atmosphere and service leaves more to be desired
It is definitely a homely and quaint restaurant
Having a grasp of the chinese language helps here, because orders are announced when they come out of the kitchen
But if you know siu gow and lai tofu, you're good to go
Bright and low on ambience, but this tiny space packs a punch
Its Chinese kitchen turns out a range of finely prepared dishes, appealing to both conservative and adventurous palates
We just had a bunch of vegetables and rice
Pretty good but nothing special to recommend it over any other place in Chinatown
Restaurant is very cold
If you are looking for an evening where you can unwind with friends, not worry about conversation or what to wear, this is the place to go
If you want good food, go somewhere else
I've been coming to this place since I was a kid, and it's always been great
I recommend El Castillo for breakfast, lunch, dinner and anything inbetween
If you like milk shakes, you have to try the Papaya shake, it's delicious
Anything on the menu is great, no duds here
Not to mention the prices are amazing, I've come here many a time and ordered tons of stuff and still I'm stunned at how low the bill is
'Castillo' is an amazing dominican restaurant on the Lower East Side
It's an unassuming restaurant, I've been passing by it for months, but I finally decided to pop in for lunch
Great service, delicious food
I haven't had Dominican food this good since I had been to the Dominican Republic
I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great authentic food at a restaurant that isn't about trends or glamour, it's just about food and service
The food is great, the service is great, the place is clean, the atmosphere is pleasant
The prices are also great
This place is good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Great Dominican meals, nice Dominican atmosphere
Very diverse group of customers
The Scene Katz's Deli is frequented by regulars who've been coming for decades, as well as tourists and neighborhood newbies; occasionally, you might catch a glimpse of a celebrity
Since its establishment in the 1890s, the deli has changed very little in appearance, retaining a grungy sheen
Grab a ticket on the way in for counter service, or seat yourself at a table to be waited on
The Food Katz's still makes about 5,000 pounds of corned beef, 2,000 pounds of salami and 12,000 hot dogs a week--the old-fashioned way, on the premises--and it shows in the massive portions the deli serves
Excellent pastrami is a big draw, as is the deli's Reuben sandwich
I've gone 2x and I can't believe how much they charge for a pastrami on rye now
It tastes great but $14 for a sandwich?! That's just too much for me
Katz's deli is a great NY experience
Is just the way it was in days gone by
Fabulous old decor the best food we had on our recent trip to NYC
Kids are welcome--the hotdogs are great! The sandwhiches are out-of-this world! The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited
A wonderful place!
My grandfather first took us here 40 years ago
Back then the only thing that mattered was corned beef on club
Today all that matters is fatty pastrami reuben and new dill pickles
Yes it's pricey for counter service, sawdust floors and deafening chatter but the pastrami makes it all worth it
The tender juicy meat dances in your mouth with every bite (the person who said it was tough must've asked for extra lean, serves you right!)
I've had equally large portions at Carnegie and Stage delis which were painfully dry
The meat cutters are not as surly as some reviewers say - gee whiz, this is New York, get over it! FYI, Katz' reuben sandwiches are traditional, which means they are NOT grilled
Corned beef is also excellent but by nature it is not as flavorful or moist
The hotdogs look great but I don't get here often enough to try different things
Only drawback is that the once freshly steamed club rolls seem to have been replaced by mediocre french rolls
In San Francisco it's Molinari's, in New York it's Katz'!
I thought I posted a review here, anyway I was there nov
05
got there at around 3 pm day before t-giving
I got my ticket and handed counter guy 3
oo and ticket
he was very nice, gave some samples, asked what I wanted, it I would like mustard, pickles
etc
I move over to the counter to order fries and a drink
Place was not busy and I found a table easy
The sandwich was decadent! the pastrami melts in your mouth! I couldn't finish it! ( a first for me) I wll be back in Nov
and it is one my lists of stops
The place isn't for scenery and atmopshere, it's for great pastami!
You have to be from NYC to properly say their slogan, Send a salami to your boy in the army! My grandfather lived across Houston in the city projects, and took me there when I was a little girl
Then, and now, you go up to the counter and getting a taste before ordering your sandwich
Formic table tops then now
Katz's is a time-warp
The delicious pastrami, corned beef, salami, tongue, etc
also remain the same
Nicely piled sandwichs on rye with spicy mustard
Chased down with Dr
Brown's Cel-Ray, or Cream soda
Heaven on a plate
While down town, hit Russ Daughters for some noshes to bring home
Yonah Shimmel's for knishes
This is what NYC is meant to be! Don't gentrify it out of existence!
I have found pastrami heaven! The sandwich is huge, the pastrami is tender, hand cut, juicy
The juices of the pastrami have a catcher in the rye bread, although you will probably give up trying to stuff the whole thing in your mouth and use a fork to spear pieces into your mouth
The pickles as a side are a great counterpoint to the pastrami, not too sour, not too crunchy
I also had the steak fries, crisp on the outside, soft like a baked potato inside
Update: March 2006
Since I wrote this review, I have been back several times, each time feeling more at home, and each time plotting how I will be able to come back again
The food is marvelous and the atmosphere is pure New York! I had the egg cream and it was great!
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat
If you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth
The pickles were great addition
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space
Katz's has been a NYC original for over 100 years
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread)
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add)
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them
Try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious
If you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been
Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli
I was glad I did

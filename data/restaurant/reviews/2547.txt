The service was beyond words
I should never have to ask to see my server, but when I asked anyone but my server for a beverage, I was quickly told I'll get your waiter
My waiter never came
I think that the wait staff also cooks the food
If that is the case it would explain alot about 1 fish 2 fish
The boast about being in business for 20yrs should be removed from the menus
I had fried chicken of which KFC runs circles around, and the fries were a knock off of poor burger king spuds
Even at the low prices for NYC standards I expect more
It seems that the restuarant takes for granted the fact that people continue to eat here because there is nothing else in the area, or affordable
I would rather save my money for a nice meal than dine here 3 times
I went to brunch with a large group after running a road race in Central Park
The service was flighty and it took two hours for me to get my food AND when I finally got the meal it was all wrong
Instead of fulfilling our individual orders, the kitchen made 5 of one thing
The restaurants blas attitude and low quality food made me cross this spot off of my UES list of eateries
Terrible
Never written a review for any restaurant before -- but felt compelle after eating here
A huge group of us called ahead for brunch
When we got there tables were not set up
We were given only one waiter for 20 people, and it honestly took over 1/2 an hour to get coffee (I actully went across the street to Dunkin Donuts!) The Brunch is almost non-existant
There are three choices - all were awful
The hash browns are a flat potato cake that looks like a deep-friend Apple Pie from Mc
Donalds
The french toast was white bread dipped in batter
Eggs were runny, cheese looked like Velveta, and the waited got several orders wrong, and forgot one! I suppose if you like cheap seafood this place might be okay, but if you're looking for brunch or good food in general, this is NOT your place
The items in the menu inside the restaurant were priced considerably higher than those posted outside
The overall quality more closely matched the prices outside
IVE BEEN TO ALOT OF SEAFOOD RESTAURANTS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS PLACE IS MY TOP 5
I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO GO
ITS ALSO A GREAT AFTERWORK SPOT
THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC AND THE SERVICE IS FAST AND FRIENDLY
The food isn't spectacular, but the prices are very good, for very fresh fish
The service is a little slow, but do we always need to be in such a hurry?? This the best hung-over brunch spot
For $10 or so you get salad, an entree and a carafe of bloody Mary's or wine
Dinner is also reasonable and they usually have good drink specials at the bar
We like to order from here when we don't feel like cooking
Do not, however, order delivery! We've ordered food to be delivered a couple times and it's always been wrong and cold! Instead, go to the bar, order a drink and order your food to go!  P
S
believe it or not their chicken is actually one of my favorite things here
I love seafood but they make the most perfectly cooked chicken it's sometimes hard to choose what to order!
If begging for water doesn't bother you, this is a great place for you
The prices seem reasonable, but you don't get much for it
We ordered rainbow trout with tossed salad
The salad was almost inedible, filled with wilted iceberg, but it took three requests to get the waitress to bring our water
When she finally did, I asked her to bring a carafe, so we would not have to continue to hunt her down
After about five minutes, I went to look for her, and she was hanging out at the bar drinking a soda with another waitress
When I asked her again, she said it would be right out
About seven minutes later, I had had enough
My husband and I got up and left
When she noticed, she couldn't believe we would actually leave! I guess I will never find out how the rainbow trout tastes
I've gone to this resturaunt several times
Delicious steamed clams,and the main dishes are out of this world
The ambiance is not too shabby, and the wait staff is always friendly
I will definately come back again again
My boyfriend and I went to One Fish Two Fish last week
For me it was the first time and I LOVED it
The food was excellent and the service was good
I am going to have my birthday dinner there because I can see it is excellent for large groups
Dont try to be too romantic with your man there, because I noticed several haters in the area
I have never eaten here, I have been alot for drinks
The workers, whether bartenders or other have all been very nice and friendly to me and my friends
A nice place to have drinks with your friends, and to meet new friends
I can't believe the good reviews that this restaurant got
It was good years ago, but now it's the pits! The free salad is a nice touch, but the free garlic bread tasted as if it had been sitting out for about 3 days
Although they do serve generous portions, I found the food to be BLAH
From the clam chowder and the steamed mussels to the lobster that my boyfriend had
the food just wasn't that good
Not to mention the waitress who screwed up my order and couldn't be found to change it
Okay, okay, she did comp
us a drink, but it didn't make up for the lousy meal
Dinner for 2 cost us around $50, there are soooo many more seafood places with good food and good service that you could spend your money on
Don't bother with this one!
I love this place
although the only thing I ever order are the steamed alaskan king crab legs
they happen to make them the best in the city
not to mention all you can eat salad and garlic bread
A very great bargain for your buck a cozy atmosphere friendly service
Generous portions at a very reasonable price
Candle lit tables in the evening
Very courteous waiters
I have always found One Fish Two Fish to be good food and good prices
The shimp and crab stuffing is a MUST
The service
well
I've had some duds BUT more often it's excellent
Helps that I frequently get the same guy who remembered me the second time he waited on me even though it had been over 9 months between visits
At La Fonda Boricua, they don't have a menu--this means that a) you should already be familiar with what you are ordering, or b) you should pay close attention when the waiter/waitress tells you the days specials, and if you ask them to repeat, they will sometimes not be to happy about it
The ambience in the restaurant is always lively and the food is usually very good, though it is sometimes a bit inconsistent
One of my friends told me about this place
So I went with a group of friends
The wait for the food was no long
But when it arrived I was surprised on how big the portions were
I had the sirloin with tostones, and the rotisserie chicken i had to taste from my friends plate
The food was wonderful
I will be coming back
The place looks so shabby, and there's no place inside to eat
But, man, is the pizza good! Best in the neighborhood (which, unfortunately, has been overrun by Dominos, Famiglia, and Rays)
He's been here forever
and the pizza is great!

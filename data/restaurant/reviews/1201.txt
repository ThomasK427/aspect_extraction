So happy we did! A random Tuesday, had our choice of tables
The lobster-lemon ravioli - fresh, full of lobster meat, broth a bit salty - I enjoyed it, the other 3 at the table didn't
Butternutsquash soup special incredible! Topped w/creme fraiche and not over-creamy itself
Loin of veal, veal breast w/foie gras - perfectly balanced and well proportioned as was the venison and the lamb dishes
Mind you - the portions aren't huge as this isn't a steakhouse
High quality meats are worth the prices and the wait
Nice atmosphere, good beverage list and very tasty desserts
Choc bread pudding really tasty w/PB icecream
The cheese plate - a nice assortment of locals with an amazing spin on 'cheesecake'
Get ready, this isn't your usual 7th Ave restaurant - it's a true dining experience! Not for vegetarians
Had a meal there last week, and although I was worried about the other reviews saying it was loud, we were there at prime time with a full room and the noise level was fine
The waitstaff was professional and although they were busy, we didn't feel neglected
Our only complaint was the kitchen was running slow and there was about 15 minutes between appetizer and main course, but it was fine, we were enjoying their bread with their amazing homemade dips
The food was seasoned perfectly, no signs of the over salting mentioned in other reviews
As far as portion size, yes they are on the smallish side compared to a TGI Fridays entree , but after having an appetizer and entree we left full
Excellent meal and their seasonal cocktails are amazing!
We were seated and ordered almost immediately
But then we waited
And waited
And waited-- without water, much less a bread basket
We finally asked someone for some coffee and waited some more
45 minutes after ordering, we flagged down our waiter
Oh it's on the way
Fifteen minutes later, it was on the grill right now
(Where was it before? Connecticut???) Fifteen minutes later we left
The host followed us out and asked why were were leaving
When we explained that we had waited for over an hour, he replied Well, it's a really busy time
And, reader: he shrugged and turned away
1) it wasn't busy AT ALL when we arrived AN HOUR BEFORE and 2) it's brunch in Park Slope
HAVE YOUR STAFF READY
I have been here twice before for dinner and thought it exceptional, but after this brunch experience, I would not go back
Have been hearing many things about Applewood (good things, not like most fo teh complaints on this board) and decided to give it a try
Went with a friend and we shared an appetizer, ordered another each and then had an entree each
There weren't many people in the restaraunt and the fire was going so it made for a nice evening
The chef even sent out a complimentery scallop with a parmesan bacon broth that was amazing
It sound strange, but it was delicious
Needless to say I left not even able to eat a dessert
I had the braised pork belly and the lamb which was beyond excellent
This excellent is highly recommended, but watch it, all of our food, plus 3 drinks apiece came out to about $125
well worth it though in my book
I attended this restauraunt with three friends to celebrate my birthday
I was drawn by the promise of organic food and cozy ambiance, however the restauraunt was so loud we were shouting at each other and the service was so snooty that I had a bad feeling before our food came out
When it did finally arrive EVERYTHING was salty from the meat to the soup to the salad
How do you make a salad salty? I have no idea, but I'm sure the people at Applewood can tell you
The point of organic food is supposed to be that it tastes better, but we couldn't taste anything over the salt
Do not waste your money on this over priced gimmick of a restaurant
My husband and I have been to Applewood twice -- the first time within a few weeks of its opening, and the last time a few weeks ago
We will not be going again
The food is good, but the portions are ridiculously small
We each ordered an appetizer and a main course, and we both left hungry
I was still very hungry as my portion was the smaller of the two -- I ordered the risotto
They must have put only half a serving cup of risotto on my plate
It is always a thrill to find a great restaurant in walking distance from my Park Slope home
Applewood is definitely my favorite New-American restaurant in the city
This restaurant is one of the few that really surprised and delighted me all through out the three courses
Some people have complained that the portions were too small but both my boyfriend and I agree, every bite delivered BIG flavors worth every cent of money we spent
And the plate sizing allowed us to enjoy the food all the way until the dessert, which is a rare occasion in this often gluttonous nation! I thought the portions were perfectly adequate
I can't wait to go back again!
I have eaten at Applewood about 5 times and the food is always pleasant
The portions are small (like everyone says) and the meat is always rare (like others have said), but I always find the dining experience to be a unique one
The cheese plate was wonderful: a camembert and blue cheese cheesecake and the chilled lobster appetizer was really great
The best thing was the Milk Chocolate Malted dessert
It was unlike anything I've ever had and so delicious!! Definitely make reservations for the weekend
My only complaint is sitting at the tables that are right on top of each other
Some of them are spaced out, but when you get stuck at one, right next to a couple arguing most of the evening, it kind of puts a damper on the experience
The food was great, but the portions were so small
The ravioli entree consisted of 2 small raviolis and some little vegetable on the side
The restaurant is overpriced
There was a long wait between courses
I remember when this was a charming place where I could hear great piano
This restaurant is nice, but I miss its former incarnation
My favorite thing about this restaurant is that it uses fresh, local, seasonal, organic produce and meats
Do try the fresco primavera cocktail madewith hangar one, lime and cilantro
It is amazingly different and refreshing
However, there is definite room for improvement in other areas
The waitstaff are friendly and knowledgeable of the wine list, and the complexity of flavors offered on the everchanging menu
However, be prepared for a 3 hour meal if you are having cocktails, appetizers, entrees, dessert and coffee
I ordered the lamb and asked for it to be medium well and received it medium rare
The duck aside from the fact that the vegetable accompaniment was only a single shallot halved, it came red and practically breathing it was so rare
Portions are sensible for some entrees but lacking side veggies for others
The warm chocolate souffle dessert is perfect with their great coffee
The food was excellent, the ambience was cozy and charming (I love the fireplace!), and the service was attentive and warm
The prices were average
You can tell the owners put some heart into the place
I would recommend making reservations
Go on an off night (during the week) so you can enjoy dinner by the fire, otherwise you may wind up eating at the bar
I have been to Applewood twice--both times the food was excellent, but I highly recommend ordering appetizers or else you will leave hungry
Dinner portions are very small and although well prepared, I think they can afford to give you a bit more for the prices they are charging
The first time I went we had excellent service, but the last time-our waitress seemed zoned out on something and was unattentive and ditzy
Creative dishes, nice staff, and a good dining experience overall
Just make sure you have a reservation--it is a small place and fills up quick!
I was taken here for my birthday after singing the praises from reading about the place in various places, and it being so close to our apartment
They did a great job with the space, the wine list was above average, the seasonal menu was stunningly good
Someone on Citysearch was complaining about not getting enough of the sides, but if you're there paying $24 an entree, you're sorely missing the point
It's about venison, pork tenderloin, etc
not rice and beans, and they get this completely right
The waitstaff were playful and polite, the music was 30 something hipster (in a good way, think Big Star), it's a perfect place to go on a cold blustery night with a date
I can't wait to see how they change the menu for spring
One disappointment, the cheese plate wasn't quite up to par
But that's it

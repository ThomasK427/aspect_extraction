This is the guy you should ask for if you want great service with absolutely ZERO ATTITUDE
Extremely sweet and very patient guiding us through a menu that was almost as hard to understand as my baby's crib assembly mannual
Food was great
Drinks were wonderful
Pricey ? Sure
But worth it once in a while
Sushi Samba is such a cool place with great food
Rolls are amazing, as is the chicken terriayki
Drinks are great too, like the mango martini
Def
pricey, but very well worth it!!!
Went to the 7th Avenue location and this was my best sushi experience ever! Once you get past the obnoxious hostess stand, it is so much fun! The music and atmosphere really add the the experience
Our waiter could not have been nicer or friendlier
Our food was so flavorful
We had two of the specials, a prawn roll and crab roll which were out of this world
We also got other rolls and sushi
The only slight negative was that the salmon was not great
The chocolate carnival dessert finished off the night perfectly!
A little drama about my reservation done two days ago but that was quickly solved
The food did not disappoint
I had a great Mosqueca with the coconut milk and lime broth lively with the bounty of the sea
The mojitos were primo as were the other fare like the fried whole snapper, soft pulled beef, one of the sushi rolls and such
Dessert was a hit and miss
I got the Brazilian coffee ice cream which was suspiciously like Haagen Dazs Coffee
The rest of my party opted for one of their crepe like creations and the plum sake sauce was an acquired taste
At $50 each, well, the vibe was young and frenetic but maybe a session at the Sushi Bar merits a second visit then opinion
The ambience of the restaurant was great, except for the group of ladies standing behind us the whole time and our seats being knocked around by people trying to get around them
Service? It was non-existent
We got all of our food before our drinks even came
Food was mediocre, I don't see what all the hubbub is about
Great Carnival Party
I almost felt like I was in Rio for a second! The crowd was great
the drinks were excellent as usual
and the food lived up to its hype! This will definitely be a spot on my social circuit!!!
I've eaten much such from the best places in Japan to the local eateries in the US
The sushi was rather poorly done
It's great that they are trying to be creative but there is no balance between their bland rice and the fish and the flavours that they add do not enhance the fish
I cannot say too much about their non-sushi plates but their sushi is a true embarassment to the Japanese sushi community
At SS7 we had the best sushi experience ever
It has a lively atmosphere and very interesting and extensive sake, wine and drink lists
The only downside was that the service was slightly spacey (although charming) and we were inappropriately pressured to leave at closing
Other details: -Sublime yellowtail and fatty tuna; -let us test a couple of sakes
Excellent dining experience this evening
The seviche and the tiraditos were tasty (although portions were a little small), and the crispy red snappy superb
Lively atmosphere, good service
I sat at the sushi counter and asked one of the sushi chefs to make me whatever they recommend
YUK!! IT WAS SO SALTY AND YUCKY!!!! Shouldn't have done that
The sushi chefs work there because they can't work elsewhere
But, to my surprise their drinks and non-Japanesey food is good
As long sushi is not ordered, I think it's okay except everything had a little too much salt for me
Is it to make us thirsty so that we drink more?
The SAMBA here is good, the exotic appetizers were great and the interior is modern and very stylish
But the SUSHI were BAD! Very expensive, overly done it tasted like anything but sushi
When something is that overcomplicated it can never turn out well
The best part about the place
the bathroom
only those are worth the trip
Talk about over doing it ! Sushi Samba suffers most dramatically from a common thread in New York eating establishments
namely, it tries WAY to hard to be hip
Although, if you want to enjoy a decent over-priced meal while feeling like your zooming along in a poor, plastic rendition of Austin Powers' jumbo-jet, then this place is for you
Definitely a great place to go
The sushi and main dinners were absolutely delicious
The drinks were also very good
I didn't have a problem with the service at all
I would definitely recommend this place
Great atmosphere
Cool, and energetic hangout place
Mediocre , dry and sometimes unpalatable sushi, even though the presentation was very creative
Nice drinks, and additions to complement the food
Cool hangout place if you can get in, and carry a conversation over the noise, but definitely not recommended for the sushi
Nice atmosphere, but good sushi? Come on
The McSushi burger was better
When arriving we were asked If we had a reservation, the place was not full at all, and I got the distinct impression that they really wish they could only serve via reservation, unfortunately it was painfully clear they did have seating
They ignored use for a minute then when realizing we were still standing there they told use we could go upstairs for seating
Upstairs they have an entirely separate hostess, as if it was a different restaurant all together, where after being asked once again if we had a reservation we were seated in a small seat, in the corner, of a practically empty room
The rest of the experience consisted of a haughty weightier, overpriced, but tasty and interesting food
Overall I didnt like them and I dont think they liked me, and I dont think Ill go back
The sushi here is remarkable
This resturant serves the finest pieces of sashimi available, and their highly creative infusion of Latin and Japanese cultures delivers rolls such as El Topo, cooked salmon on a bed of rice and topped with melted mozzarella, a drop of melted spicey cheddar cheese, and fried onion
The resturant caters to New Yorkers from all different walks of life, and the staff on 7th Avenue consists of the most beautiful women the city graciously offers
The ambience is trendy and slightly cutting-edge
This place was recommended to me since this was my first trip to NYC
Three of us went to dinner since it was our last night at NYC
Everything was awesome - service, drinks (try Sambarita Choco Loco), atmosphere, and most of all the food
I highly recommend it
I'll have to go again next time
I have to say, Sushi Samba is a good place to sit down either on a date or with a group of friends to have a good time, however, the service needs a little more polishing
The average service is just Ok, it does not correspond to the kind of place and the prices we pay
don't understand why everyone said the service was horrible
i actually had great service
food was good, but not outstanding
drinks were unreal (a little too unreal)
good place for the starstruck (Eve was at the next table)
Made reservations here in advance for a date and asked for a good table
When I got there on time they sat my date and I at a small table in the corner next to a crowded bar
Took nearly 25 minutes to get a decent table
Other than that mix up the food was excellent, particularly the salmon jalepeno roll and El Topo
This is one of the best places my friends and I have been
Our server made recommendations for our group of 6 and loved everything
The ceviche was especially fabulous

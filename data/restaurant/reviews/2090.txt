I think it is romantic because although you are in a tight space you are closer to your date and can talk to them without shouting
You should definitely make a reservation
We had to wait only a few minutes to be seated
It was totally worth the money and I would go back
Valentines Day is done right
They make you leave a deposit - in person - to get a table - so only the serious need apply
The food is excellent - the ravioli appetizer with butternut squash and sweet potato is to die for
The room (actually 2) is decorated with many balloons and it looks quite nice - but i wouldn't say romantic because tables are close and it is crowded
The prices are also jacked up for the night - nearly $60 for 2 courses and $70 for 3 courses but it is THE place to be
I was there previously and it is consistently great
This is a great date place, as evidenced by the two dates happening on either side of us
Really romantic ambiance enhanced by friendly service and great food
We had seared scallops and the goat cheese ravioli as appetizers
Both very nice dishes
For mains we had the skate and lamb
The lamb was outstanding, in a very unusual soy glaze
Limited wine list, but we found a good Italian (Vicara) on it
A good value overall, and definitely a place we'll be back to
The bar side looked quite lovely as well- a nice place for a drink
My boyfriend and I needed a romantic night out on the town and The Place was perfect
We had a great meal and the waitstaff was fantastic
I would definitely recommend this place
A very quiet, charming restaurant
My date practically melted when we got there
Not fancy at all, but classy nonetheless
Good wine list, rough around the edges decor
With wood beams, fireplaces, and intimate lighting, this place screams old New York
The food is excellent, with a variety of European dishes and the absolute best part of the mean is the divine chocolate cake
Went with my BF and the decor is nothing out of ordinary but was cozy
Service was good, I had to steak which was good but my bf had the pork lion, not so good
The duck config was yummy
Wine list not huge but some good wines there
give it a try
Average food and service
Romantic but lack of detail and grace
Not a good value
Bad bathrrom
Pay 30 more bucks for a high-end restaurant!!
Absolutely fabulous food in an incredibly cozy setting- perfect for a romantic occasion or intimate meal with good friends or family
We had the scallop, mussels and arugula salad apps- all were excellent- the scallops were the best I have had in a long time- perfectly seasoned but not overpowering
The hearty fare winter menu includes great dishes to warm up to in the cold weather- we had the pork, hanger steak and short ribs- our plates were clean- save room for dessert and do not pass up the triple chocolate cake- it is fabulous- the apple tart, all though very good, paled in comparison
They also have a very nice, manageable and affordable wine list
The place is very charming and quite romantic in one of the nicest areas of New York
The service is very good and friendly
The food is good, even if not spectacular
The price is reasonable
Just came back from The Place
The low lit candle light atmosphere impressed me
The food was great; we had home-made pasta and steak
Although the steak was a bit on the tough side, the taste defintely made up for it
Service was also great
I recommend it to any couple and non-couple
We had to try this restaurant after all the great reviews
We fully agree! The service was very good, waiters very knowledgable about wine and the menu
The atmosphere was very cozy and romantic
The tables are just a little too close together
I would request a corner table when making a reservation
The food is delicious
My husband had the pork and he said it was one of the best meals he ever had
The butternut squash risotto is also excellent
The hangar steak was okay, I have had better
Prices also very reasonable
All in all, a truly wonderful place!
This place is very nice and cozy
One of the nicer places around the area where food is soo good and the atmosphere is better
Quite romantic
Really, this place is the best dining experience in New York City

Very romantic spot
This is definitely the best dining experience in NYC
My girlfriend was completely blown away by everything
The service is great, the food is great, and the owner even came by after we ate to make sure everything was great
I recommend The Place to everyone I know
This really is THE Place
Ask in advance for a romantic table and you will get one
The entire place is perfect for a special occasion for two
The food and service are excellent and the prices are very good
I loved this place---so romantic, and absolutely everything I want in a nyc dining experience! Great food, impeccable service, and I just loved it there!
I want to be proposed to in this restaurant
The atmosphere is warm, cozy and classy, the service impeccable
The food, ah, the food
prepared with love and perfection, especially the skate entree, and wonderful flourless chocolate cake
One of New York's treasures tucked away in a tiny downstairs settings with delicious food and great wine
A perfect find if you want to impress the certain someone special
Had a wonderful dinner here and plan to return very soon!
I went to The Place last night to celebrate my anniversary
The ratings on this site were right on
Not only was the food amazing, the atmosphere very romantic and the wait staff friendly, but you feel like you are away on vacation! The low ceiling makes you feel like you are in a hidden secret in New England
I would recommed this restaurant to everyone I know and tell them the 3 chocolate cake is a must!
Good service, very cozy, friendly staff, excellent food and 10% of profits go to charity
what a great place
The Place is located on the quieter end of West 4th and has a few outdoor tables as well as a small bar area and romantic dining room
There are fireplaces and candles throughout and the walls are made to look like stone - a lovely atmosphere
There isn't a huge selection of food, but there's something on the menu for everyone to really enjoy
The selection of West African wines is a nice touch as well

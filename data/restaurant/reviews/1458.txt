The care is evident from the tender beef to the fresh sprigs of herbs adorning the plates
If anything, go for the food and see for yourself
the dinner food is the kind you can make in your kitchen, but i imagine it part of the concept
i've been checking it out for the last few months, and it seems to be getting better
go there for dinner after 8pm and the ghosts of earlier children will be silenced
the service is pretty good, especially the scruffy guy who makes you feel welcome but not in a bad way
i recommend this place for the twenty five plus crowd, especially after 8pm!!
Had dinner here on a weeknight and the service was friendly and attentive
Enjoyed the cute decor, especially the pictures of the birds
You must try the pear salad with walnuts and goat cheese
Sandwiches were good, too
We would have sat in the nice garden but it was about to rain
I would definitely dine here again
One word of advice to the Park Slope parents - when the brats start to scream bloody murder, remove them from the restaurant!
There are a lot of things about Perch to like
The space is beautifully designed, the cheese grits with ham are delicious, the welcome to neighborhood families is appreciated
BUT: the service is just awful
I've been trying them out every month or so since they opened this winter, hoping that the long waits and constant confusion at the counter were kinks that would be worked out
Not so
If you have 30 minutes to kill waiting for an egg sandwich, look no further
Loved LOVED the food
And for the Slope it's nice to finally get some great healthy food at reasonable prices
The coffee rocks and it looks great HOWEVER there seems to be tons of children there all the time
I understand families need to eat too but maybe they can try to seat families up in the front area for the most part and get some seating in the back for the rest of us? It's just difficult to relax and/or have a conversation when kids are shrieking around you
I'll be back for the food and coffee although I have to admit it won't be as often as I would have liked
tried perch for brunch today and was disappointed
the place is cute, the menu looks good and the gimick is alright, too - you place your order at the counter and then are given a number and the food is delivered
but it just doesn't work - silverwear and napkins are self serve, but no one tells you that - there is no water to be found, except at the counter, where you have to order it
food was ok, but plain and boring
the number sysytem wasn't working either -the server kept walking over to every table asking who ordered what
no coffee refills?? no homefires or sides of any kind?? you ran out of oj and grits?? - it's brunch, right? hope they work it out or they will be shortlived
Oga offers one of the most amazing food experiences in New York
It's the kind of hidden gem you want to invite your friends to so that they can then tell their own friends
I've been there 3-4 times and loved it each time - a wonderful combination of Oriental cuisine and Western ingredients, a long and extremely varied menu full of great finds, fresh ingredients and beautifully prepared dishes
In short, definitely come here for the food
Waiters are young and inexperienced, so the service is so-so (they're all very nice though, just a bit too eager)
The ambience and decor are OK, but very subdued
The food easily makes up for both of these issues, though
We tried to go to Ricki and sagagura, but they were both closed, well Ricki wasnt open yet, rude rude waitress
The food was amzing here, comparable to nobu
Everything was fresh and delicate
Lots to chose from
We had the kobe beef, sashimi of the day, foi gras dumplings, all sorts off stuff and a big bottle of sake
It came out to 170 for 2
Which i thought was reasonable
The waitress hovers too much which annoys me, but she was otherwise sweet and accomodating
We will try the rolls next time, it would probably be more filling
Otherwise, great dining experience, nice space, go!
I thought the tuna tostado was interesting but outside of that the food was just eh
The plating is pretty and the scene is clean and open
The service is also good but for me it boils down to the food and I just didn't think there was much to it
i went to Oga's with my friends before the broadway show
it's only 10 mins walks from the broadway theater district
we had spicy tuna tostado and some tapas
pretty delicious! i would definitely go back to oga's to try their unique food! a+ service!!
Overall, the food was quite creative but not very tasty
I thought the rolls were just average and the item I found most memorable was the tuna tartare-topped tostada
This place is perfect for couples and groups but it's so quiet that you have to whisper to not seem rude
Our waiter was very knowledgable of the menu, which is always good
However, another server kept hovering over our table, wanting to take our half-finished plates away
The food here is amazing and the service was great
I am definately going back
i went to check out this new place since i live in the neighborhood
They have a beautiful, romantic dining room and the bar is hip, stylish, yet elegant
The place is simple, clean and highlighted with exotic flowers
Most of all, the food is tremendous
Try avocado croquette and kobe beef cappacio! You can even design your own roll at oga's too
They have a vegetarian friendly menu and a good selection of sake as well as sake shoju based cocktails
The potion is kinda small but VERY pretty!! it will please your eyes
don't forget to have their home-made desserts
my girlfriend had a black sesame sobet and I had a homemade chocolate cake! it just came out of the oven and was Soooooo good!!

My girlfriend loved their black sesame sobet and I had crush on the HOME-MADE chocolate cake
I really just found this place out of curiosity but I'm glad I decided to check it out
Its really a great place, nice atmosphere and most importantly good food!!! They have a good mix of vegetarian, seafood, beef dishes and of course sushi
The enoki beef asparagus is pretty good for beef dishes
Its asparagus wrapped in cooked slices of beef and glazed with a nice teriaki-like sauce
The roast duck is good as well, it's made of slices of roast duck and comes with these little pankages to wrap them in, along with a pretty good sauce
The Sushi rolls are all really good but I recommend one Mr
Oga's special rolls, give his B-29 and B-52 rolls a try!
A new restaurant in my 'hood! So I was all excited decided that I would use Ginger to host an event
Well, they lost my records, kept me waiting for 6 weeks to even tell me! If someone had been upfront with me I wouldn't have been upset
There was a change in personel stuff happens
Then I get a very flat indifferent I'm sorry from the new manager who now works there
Now I have less than three months in which to plan a whole event
The food is not bad but since the management service are awful the food isn't even enough to get me in there
Ginger is badly run it's a shame
Don't bother with this restaurant
Better ones are in the same area
Seemed nice
On hold for 10 minutes, called again gave order, minimum order 25$ although they are 5th/116th and I am on lenox/114th (3 blks away) I order
after an hour I call, I get a soon enough so I wait another hour and I call again, pissed I have been waiting for 2 hours and what is going on
They look me up and say it's on it's way
I say cancel the order, I have never had such bad and indifferent service and all I get is a we were really busy today
No apology or anything, they seem perfectly content with me just cancelling
Bad way to operate a business
I get consitantly good service from the rinky-dink place in the 'hood and get it 20 min or less

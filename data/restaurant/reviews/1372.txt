The lobster was a bit better but not properly described on the menu
We did not bother to order dessert, however they brought out complimentary chef cookies which tasted like they had sat in a vat of oil for a week
The staff was very kind accommodating, which is a rare to find
Please dont waste your time or money on Thor when there are so many wonderful restaurants in this city
Even though we had reservations we had to wait 1+ hour to be seated
Service was atrocious: appetizers came out 3 minutes after we ordered, and 10 minutes before we finally tracked down the bottle of wine we had ordered, the waiter rushed us from start to finish, we had to repeatedly track down someone to pour us more wine since it wasn't at the table, etc, etc
just plain awful
So we thought the food would redeem the restaurant
wrong
bland, boring, and just not very good at all
With the options this city has at these prices I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this restaurant
However, the bar is great
great scene, great drinks
so go around the corner to The Orchard for dinner and then go to the bar after for drinks
that will make for a great night
Dining room wasn't filled, but we still were seated 25 minutes after our reservation
Then finally, when we get seated, they wedge us in the corner against a wall blocking most of the main dining space
Were we 4 women? We didn't fit the scene? Regardless, we asked to be seated in the main area of the room
The hosts returns and responds, Well, it was reserved, but they haven't arrive yet, so if you really want to move that bad
Didn't we make make a reservation too? So many restaurants in the city, need not return
Oh, and they raised their prices since they first opened
Patrons, beware
Took my wife there for Valentine's day
What a romantic place
Glad we both decked out - everybody looked like a million bucks
Service was friendly and efficient
We waited for a while for the table
More chance to drink in the ambience - I was not in a hurry
Bar drinks were excellent
Food was excellent, not cheap, but worth it
We live in the city and go out all the time
We will be back
I made reservations 2 weeks in advance
The night of my reservation, I was 20 minutes late
To my surprise they ended up not seating us in the dining room but sat us in the bar area
I was outraged! I tried to speak to them but they were rude and uncooperative
When the food arrived, I kept telling myself maybe the food will be worth the aggravation But to my dismay it was not
The waiter gave us the check and I didn't even ask for it, which I thought was rude
He came by twice to ask me if the check was ready
I finally decided I did not like to be rushed and paid and left
I am a foodie and am a Wallse lover too, but this place is not worth going back
Overall Service sucks, food bland, and not worth the money you pay
I don't know where these other reviewers ate, but you will get an great meal at Thor
The ambiance is perfect! Modern but comfortable, trendy but unpretentious
The food is very creative, try the beet and goat cheese appetizer, the lobster with beans ad bernaise and the honey glazed sardines
mva! It was nice to see Kurt, the chef, wondering around macking on the ladies
My only critique is that the service is ordinary
Food comes out too fast from the kitchen, so make sure you ave your drink order in before you order your meal
I would linger over the last couple bites, as too slow down the service
I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new things and appreciates creative, balanced food
Everything about the scene here is cool
The bar is sleek and the drinks are good
The food was great and the portions were perfect
Service was great
Overall a great experience
Can't wait to try out KG's other restaurants for some good Austrian food
Went for dinner on a saturday night and could not have had a worse experience
First, the place was so loud that i had to scream at my guest across the table
I was closer to the table next to me than I was to my guest
We placed an order for a bottle of wine and our apps
arrived well before it
After we reminded some server about it and others came to verify our selection, it finally arrived
Teeney tiny portions, lambchops were laughable in size, the bill however was huge
Never will I return
Reservation for a party of 12, the table wasn't ready and they essentially had to kick out the table next to us to get our seats
The staff was very rude and intrusive, I had my face in the busboys armpit for most of the night as he was reaching for things to set and clear, with no excuse me's
They had us as offering a coffee and would not leave until someone took it, even go so far as to try to slyly set it next several people and walk away
The waiter became very angry that we would not take it
While we were paying the waitress was harassing us over the credit card receipts before we even gave them out to everyone to sign
The automatic 20% gratuity was certainly not earned and the service was no where near what you should get for a $900 meal
I would not recommend Thor to anyone
I dine out in the city both for business and with friends and would not recommend anyone visit this restaurant for either purpose
While our waiter was very accomodating the overall management of the restaurant is terrible
We had a group of 7 and were basically seated in the kitchen, even though we made a reservation way in advance
It was a saturday night and we wanted to have a fun holiday dinner out
Thor did all they could to ruin that
The food is nothing special and not worth the rude treatment
went to check out what the fuss was, but there wasn't any
the waiter seemed bored and indifferent, not what you'd expect from a restaurant like this
food came out quickly! so cold (temp
wise), there was a huge draft from the kitchen
the portions are so SMALL the dishes that were recommended, should not have been, like the halibut wrapped in potato, the most unflaky, unmoist fish i'd ever had
the snickers bar dessert, dissappointed!  nothing unique, or creative about this place! i don't get the critics, has there taste buds just become numb???
decor is unique and bathrooms are fabulous
food is not quite as fabulous
food came fast
not much of a presentation, very small portions and not much flavor
drinks were great and had a wonderful bottle of wine- Gavi
Dessert menu looked yummy but did not feel like being anymore so we got the check
nice experience but by no means a quality restuarant
too many great places in NY to choose from to settle for hype and buzz that turns out to be mediocrity
this place is just another trendy NY restaurant
Nothing special
Decor is nice for Lower East Side
the food was terrible
My gnocchi was the soggiest i have EVER had, and I have had a lot of bad food
If the chef tasted the Gnocchi, he would have been ashamed! veal tenderloin was good, but it was only 1 x 1 x 2
5 inches, with no sides
$65 a head
not worth the money to me

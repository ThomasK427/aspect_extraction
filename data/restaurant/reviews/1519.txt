Great atmosphere and the food is worth the wait
The sangria is the best I have ever tasted!
I have eaten at this restaurant many times, and although I am a NYC restaurant snob -- this little gem in North Bergen is absolutely the best! The food, the service, and the decor would stand up to the finest restaurant in NYC
Give yourself a treat and head on over to NJ and try this place out
Finding a great neighborhood Italian restuarant is as important as a dry cleaner, ATM and florist
Palermo's has excellent pizza and tasty red sauce dishes as well
The buffet is great- I love the mushroom soup
Lots of good seafood as well
Bartender poured a great gin and tonic
Lunch crowd is mostly older individuals
Perfect place for weddings
Men must have jackets and reservations are usually required
This is a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary
We celebrated our anniversary but went on a Sunday since it is a small place we thought it would be too crowded on a Saturday
The view is very nice and the service was the best! The food was very good too
I have health problems and they helped me with the menu to make it easier for me to eat
The price's are very high,but, it was our anniversary so we didn't mind
We wouldn't come here just to go out for dinner unless we had a celebration
YEa sure they do the cool onion volcano thing but the food was too salty and it wasn't all that good either for the price we paid
But I guess most Hibatchi restaurants aren't cheap
gREAT PLACE TO SIT BACK LISTEN TO MUSIC MEET NEW PEOPLE
I would just like to say that Los Tapatios has to be the best AUTHENTIC Mexican food i have ever eaten
The owner, Mr
Godinez, is a very warm and friendly person, i go there every week at least once a week with my family, and he goes up to us and talks to us as if we were close friends
I have seen him treat his customers with great respect and in a very friendly manner
His wife is the head cook, and his two kids (son and daughter) work with him
It is a very nice family atmosphere, the service is great and the food is incredible
I just wanted to share this with everyone because they are small and a lot of mexican food lovers don't know what they are missing out on
Found this place (just a couple of blocks from home) while watching TV's Soprano's
What better food to gnash on while watching the Good Fellas of the 21st Century than Italian? The food is attainable, fast and authentic
Spices, meats, cheeses
it's all there
From pizza to sandwhiches to specialty meals, you'll get good food fast and cheap
Just the thing to insure you never miss a hit
Manga!
This is my lunch time favorite spot there food is very tasty, they have the best chicken soup I have tasted in awhile
I like how they already have the food ready and you can order from there daily menu
Yummy yum
I love this place there portions are enormous and the flavor of the food is excellent
I am so happy to be the first to leave a recomendation, its a great place to take friends and family and have a nice familystle dinner
The food at this place is absolutely amazing
The location of the restaurant is not particularly great, but for the quality of the food, the amount of food and the price it is soooo worth it
Very casual, friendly down home cooking where everything tasted as though made from scratch
Reminded me of all the little authentic Colombian places in Queens
Highly recommended if you like good food
Not for restaurant snobs! It's a family owned place -- small and you may need to practice some spanish but well worth it
We had dinner here last night and we were very impressed
Me girlfriend and I have lived in NYC for the past 7 years and love new dining experiences
The setting here is amazing and the back garden is impressive
In addition the wait staff was extremly good
The food is very tasty but you need to know that the menu is set up as a price fixe
The portions are very small but extremly flavorful
If you like to sample various dishes you will love this place
We started with Tuna Sushi which was served over lump crab and cold seasme noodles (excellent), followed by a seared jumbo scallop over black sticky rice
We went on the try 2 more dishes and I highly recommend the Lamb which is served with spicy sausage
The dessert is also excellent
Overall we loved this place
If you like high end food, and a veriety of flavors this is the place
If you like large portions and over stuffing yourself pick another place
The pricing is good and we spent $120 for the 2 of us thanks to BYOB
This place is really great
It is unique in that there are no app's just meals and they are served as 3-5 course meals
Just enough food to fall in love with each dish
Keep in mind the portions are small and the bill can get steep if you like to eat a lot
The outdoor garden, service and decor make this place truly amazing
Enjoy
This is a great find tucked away across from Rutherford station
I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food
The mussels were excellent
It's BYOB, so make sure you bring your own wine
All in all excellent value
If you are looking for a true italian food and ambience this is The place
Service very attentive and Corrado is the perfect host!!! The food is like in Italy and all my family and friends love this place
Very good prices
I have been going to Mazur's for years
the quality of their cakes/cookies hasn't changed
it's nice to know that you can rely on this
Everytime I go back home, I try to sneak in a trip over to Mazur's
never disappointing
This bakery is the greatest
Don't pass it by, you will be sorry
Simply put, the BEST Italian pastries in the Garden State
Take it from me, the Italian Food Afficionado, you won't find better in North Jersey
I've searched all the famous bakeries around for that perfect canolli napoleon, and have found it! Cookies and breads are also outstanding, but the Canollis take the prize
Even though I've moved about 20 minutes away, I'll still make the drive once in a while just for a $1
50 canolli or a napoleon
I always make sure to get there when I'm in the area
Also be sure to try the Italian ice, second only to cha-cha's in NYC!
Perfect for family, schools, and groups
Very well organize from entering to exiting the castle
At extra charge you will enjoy Alcoholic beverages and will be able to take a photo home as well
I have seen the show 5 times and its always a great experience to be in the castle and to see the show
grate horse show, and display of 12 century fighting by the knights, you have to eat with your hands!!
Okay, you want mamma's cooking? You've come to the right place
Their food is excellent
The service is very good
They ambience is not great so don't take your Big clients who you want to impress with effects
Not a romantic setting
But the big plus is the food
Tasty

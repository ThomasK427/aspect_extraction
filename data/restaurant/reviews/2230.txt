If I hadn't read about this place in citysearch I wouldn't have chosedn to stop there
It's quite a narrow establishment so it's easy to pass by it when walking on the street
But it's definitely worth a stop to enjoy a great hamburger or chicken sandwich
The portions are generous too
I had the Black Blue burger
Blackened burger with a chucky slice of blue cheese on top
delicious
All menu choices come either burger or chicken
The chicken breast that I sampled was great too
My mouth is watering just writing this
Any way you want it, any topping you can imagine (and some you've never imagined), any combination you can think of
these burgers are hands down, the best I've ever had in NYC
I've lived here 13 years and believe me, I've searched
The burgers are hand shaped, thick and juicy and usually by the time all toppings are loaded on, it is not humanly possible to fit your mouth over the sandwich but somehow I always manage
If you aren't in the mood for red meat, simply order the grilled chicken in it's place
My personal favorite? The Tijuana burger with extra ranch dressing
I'm sitting here, mouth watering just thinking of it
Don't deprive yourself of this experience
(Decor is at a minimum but retro 60's, but I go for the food!)
Unbelievable selection of burgers
Unlike any other NYC burger place
Forget Ranch One, this is the best grilled chicken sandwich in the world
And the variety of burgers are second to none
Whaterver option or toppings you choose, you are going to get the best burger you've ever eaten
My mouth waters just thinking about it! You get quality meet and a huge portion for a cheap price
The same goes for the grilled chicken sandwiches and salads
This is the best burger in town
The chicken sandwiches are great too
And the BEST shakes
I love this place
Try the Mad, Mad World Churasco
Killer
amazing burgers and the most inventive toppings for burgers you have ever seen
the salads are also great if you want to eat healthy
don't skip the dirty potato chips
yumm
My wife woke up and said I want a really good burger today
So I got on the web, did some research and decidede to try Island burger
WOW
Great burger
Anybody who gives these burgers bad marks is flat out lying
Yes you can top these things with a thousand things, but the amazing thing is that no matter what you put on these heavenly beef concoctions it does nothing but ENHANCE the flavor of the meat, not cover it up
And about the french fries, get over it, have a shake and beleive me you got enough food and calories to carry you for a while
Island Burger is the best burger we ever had at a restaurant (and I have to work really hard to get them to taste that good at home and rarely succeed)
This tiny place deservedly attracts lots of people, so expect to wait, particularly during lunch and dinner hours
The food is worth the wait, and inexpensive for quality, quantity, and presentation
Lots of choices if you're after a burger or a chicken sandwich
This diner is just okay for the price
you definately pay for the location (close to central park and carnegie hall) because you aren't paying for the quality of the food which was rather bland
the coffee was weak, and the service was slow and inattentive
on the plus side, the fruit cup was large, the choices were ample, and the fruit was all fresh
overall a below-average experience  i'll stick to the diners south of 34th street and in bklyn if this palce is representative of the rest of manhattan
Even if there's a line, it doesn't take long to be seated
The menu selection is large and the service was fast
All the food arrived hot and was good
We ate there for two lunches and one breakfast on a weekend trip
Give it a shot
The food is great
Loved the coffee
Yes, this place's soup dumplings aren't as good as the Flushing or Pell Street branches
Yes, the dumpling skin is a little too thick compared to the Flushing or Pell Street versions
However, they do a very decent Abalone with Spinach and Tofu with Crabmeat
And their waitstaff aren't as surly as the ones in Flushing or Pell Street plus you aren't forced to share a table with strangers
In general, northern cuisine tends to be spicier and greasier with flavors being aggressively dominant while southern cuisine tends more towards stir fries and steamed recipes and tastes are more subtle
We headed over to Joe's Shanghai on 56th street for the delicious soup dumplings we love
Looking over the menu, we realised that the prices were 'Manhattan prices' instead of the Chinatown/flushing prices we were used to ( the soup dumplings were at least 2 dollars more expensive)
Futhermore, when the dumplings came, instead of the usual 8 dumplings per order, it was only 6! We wouldn't have minded so much since the decor here were more fancy but the main reason we go to JS is for the soup dumplings but what a disappointment! The soup dumplings were not 'soupy' enough( no oozing of the soup into the mouth) and the 'skin' of the dumplings were thick! This isn't the Joe's we know!  Before leaving NY, we went to Joe's Shanghai in Flushing and had meal we knew to expect there
Delicious ,juicy, cheap soup dumplings!
Joe's Shanghai located in Chinatown offers a much beter value and larger serving
Food is twice as good as well
The midtown location just doesn't have the appeal or value - but the steam soup buns are still amazing and a great luncheon spot
maybe I'm picky but I gave this place many chances and to be honest nothing is good here except for the steamed pork buns with crab meat
I take it this is a place you either love or hate from all the reviews
the dumplings are good (crab meat preferred) but petshopgirl is correct, they are quite oily/greasy
but then again, almost all chinese food is oily/greasy
other dishes just ok
have gone a few times in flushing chinatown, last time got montezuma's revenge - which is the last time for me
svc
is not their theme their success belies the quality
SUM IT: If you have to try it, try it once
then you decide if you love it or hate it
but not worth the price
there are better shanghai eateries still not spoiled by success
Good Food
Great Soup Dumplings, Red Bean Cakes, Turnip Cakes, Best General Tsao's Chicken, Pan fried noodles
Good Value
Best for a group - portions are big and meant for sharing
Queens (Elmhurst) location is never crowded, which is a BIG plus over the chinatown location
I can't believe this place has been rated anything higher than the greasiest chinese restaurant in small-town America
It's a shame that they're riding on a reputation that doesn't hold anymore
What a waste of time and money
Not for anyone with standards
Joe's Shanhai is one of those restaurants you go to despite the poor service
The food makes up for it, though the quality has fallen victim to it's success
Nowadays, the only thing we order there are the dumplings and the vegetarian duck
Yes, the food was good before it got famous, but since they got well known, and opened other shops, their quality has dropped
It is overated by many ppl who don't know much about Chinese food
Have been a fan of Dim Sum for many years, but love the steamed buns here at Joe's
Nothing like them
I think they are the best that I have had so far

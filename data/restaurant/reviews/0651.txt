I've had a few events there that were fun
As a regular patron to this place for happy hour and drinks, I will NEVER go back to Link again! I should mention that this place now has new owners and I strongly recommend never going there
My friend had her card down for a tab and when she tried to sign it out, they realized they accidently gave it to another customer! What kind of mistake is that - especially since it was admittedly given to a male customer! To make matters even worse, this is the kind of customer service this place has: when my friend proceeded (rightly so) to complain about the situation, she in turn did not get an apology but she got screamed at (and was even called a name I can't mention here)
Completely unacceptable behavior!!!
Went there for drinks last night
Had a martini that came with ice cubes floating in it
Wasn't going to make a big deal about it until I saw they were charging me a $2 up fee for my drink
I asked the waitress what this was for and her responses were as follows: We put in an extra shot, We had to use ice in the drink, and It must have been the computer
If you go, make sure they're not charging for ice that night, and that the computer's under control
Last week, I went to Link with the girl I am dating after we saw a show across the street at Irving Plaza
First of all, the place is designed beautifully inside
It is a dark sexy, sleek lounge with velvet couches, candles and amazing music playing in the background
The girl who I am dating, could not stop raving about the place the whole night
Honestly, for the look and ambience of the place I would have expected this place to be 5X the cost that I actually payed and I would have payed it
They serve only top shelf liquor( but surprisingly not at top shelf prices)
We only had appetizers there, but they were out of this world
The waitstaff (all female) were absolutely stunningly beautiful
I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone
I've been at this bar a few times since it first opened up and unfortunately, this place is getting worse and worse
We went last night for my girlfriend's birthday party and it was completely dead
We had 30 people with us and that pretty much represented 75% of the people
The drinks were completely watered down
My friends had to request that the waitress bring back the drinks and make them stronger
The music was terrible
We got there around 10 and given our massive group, they still would not change the music until it was around 11:30 even given our requests
I've been here probably 6 times and this is the last time I am coming here
If you are looking to dance, do not go here
If you are looking to chill and not do anything or meet any people, than this is the place for you
My boyfriend and I chose this venue to host his birthday this year
We were hesitant since the reviews had not been the greatest and it's normally pretty quiet when we pass by
It turned out to be an excellent choice! The manager- Oren was great! There was no cover all nite, no cake serving surcharge, etc
The drinks are reasonable priced
Decor is trendy
The staff remained friendly even though they were overwhelmed by all our party goers
Some minor negatives
They seemed understaffed at the bar and the flow of the music was off
Strongly suggest making arrangements for additional bartenders with them if you've got a over 100 people
The music and the vibe was good
At times, the transition from one song to another or from one type of music to another was off
Match the beats! A professional dj is the only other thing they're lacking
Based on the high rating here, we went there for a birthday dinner during the middle of the week
We found little to justify a recommended status
The place was basically dead and virtually no music was being played to liven it up
We were given filthy wineglasses by a forgetful (and eavesdropping) waiter and served very small food portions
The food was admittedly good but you just don't get much
The bartender was cool though, and you could tell they were trying hard to do well; however, they simply didn't pull it off
A B+ for effort, a C- for result
I will not be going back
We had dinner before theatre and it took forever to get the food to the table
The server was polite and explained that it was busy so the kitchen was backed up
When the food got there all of the meat temperatures were wrong, some of the sauces were more like paste, and the dishes looked thrown together
Dirty rims and fingerprints on the plates
The flavors were mild and virtually non-existent
The high light was the fondue, that we never got because again the server said the kitchen was too busy
We barely made it to the theatre and will not dine there again
The service staff was very nice and attentive but the food experience killed it for us
You could sense that the service staff wanted to give good service but the kitchen was holding them back
The bar was cool and the bartenders were very friendly
Link is a great place to go for cocktails
Their white angel martini is fabulous and their steak is good
Calamari is tasty too
The outdoor seating area makes for good summertime dining
Lounge is cool and vibe is chill
My girlfriend and I came to Link on a Tuesday evening for drinks and dinner
The ambience in the lounge was romantic with a touch of hipness
We ordered some really great cocktails- I'm not a big fan of fruity drinks, but their Tangerini was amazing
The cocktail waitress was prompt and very friendly
We then moved to the dining room for dinner
I didn't like the lighting and the music was a little off
Still, we got the Kobe Beef and Cod for dinner and it was unbelievably good
Service was great as well
We're definitely coming back to Link, maybe on the weekend when it's more happening though!
great service
nice decor
my girlfriends went on a quiet tuesday nite
there was no need for reservations, it was relatively empty a few other tables were eating at the time
but then it was a relatively early dinner
appetizers were great
the rice rolls with kobe beef tartar was only mediocre, it was hard to taste the beef at all, and i was slightly disappointed
the crabcakes had pieces of crabshell in it, and was a lil too heavily breaded for our tastes
the main courses were very good
steaks fantastic
presentation beautiful
scallops divine
we ordered a chocolate fondue for dessert
the chocolate was watery, and cold
the accompaning fruits and cake was delish
too bad about the chocolate which should have been the main feature
all in all it was pretty good, we just wish we had tired a different dessert!! =(
Had a wonderful dinner here on a quiet Tuesday night
We had reservations, but they were not needed as the dining area was deserted
Loved the sparse decor, downtempo electronic music (Dido for one), candles and overall ambience
All of the food, from the amuses to the appetizers, the entrees and dessert were excellent
Highlights include the basil and pastry wrapped scallops, the tornado of salmon, wild mushroom ravioli, chicken sate in spicy coconut peanut sauce, lobster dumplings and triple berry cake
The wine list ranged in price from $30 to $100
Dinner for two with 2 drinks and one bottle of wine came to $170 with tax and tip and I felt this was a good value
We'll definitely be back
My girlfriends and I went to this place on a Friday night to celebrate her birthday
We had a great time the drinks were out of this world
And the staff was also great

The decor is really tasteful and well thought out
Prices won't kill you
Highly recommended!
what a makeover in that space
clean lines comfortable banquettes and great lighting! The food is not to be believed
fresh seafood, prepared as if a Greek with a world view was in the kitchen ( I hear he's a French Laundry alum) has clean well defined flavors
traditional dips are flavorful and were great to share
The warm friendly service was knowlegable and profesional but not overbearing a big help in navigating this menu! I'm coming back for lunch!
The food was average, but the service was great
We were seated promptly at lunchtime, and the server was really polite
He came by to check on us if we needed anything from time to time
Unforunately, since the food wasn't all too wonderful, I never came back here because there was nothing spectacular about the food
I know that's harsh, but I have to be honest
There are a number of places in that area that I would highly recommend going instead of this place
The eggs are always undercooked and the veggies are mushy and old
Yet, we keep coming back because it is in our building and not completely unedible
Just don't expect a culinary masterpiece
Without a doubt, this place has the worst service I have encountered in the city
I went to Bully's with three friends, and besides a 20 min wait even to get out order taken, the waitstaff got three out of four meals wrong
Even better, when they tried to fix the orders, two came back wrong again
They also tried to convince me that Canadian Bacon was turkey bacon
This place is a joke
Too many good restaurants in the city to waste your time with this place
An accidental run-in has turned into a near-weekly visit
If you're interested in good bang for your buck, Bully's is a fine spot
The burgers are delicious and gigantic (always a good combo) at about $7
50/pop ($9
50 w/ fries or chips) while I've heard positive reviews of the salads
The service isn't spectacular and neither is the ambience, but on a lunch hour, all you're looking for is a satisfied stomach
And I, certainly, am a satisfied customer
The Scene This tiny jewel of a spot is simply decorated with white walls and plate glass
Diners choose between deep banquettes or seats at the bar, which offer a front-row view of the small preparation area and a chance to watch the two chefs as they whip together the elegantly constructed desserts
The Food The precious, polished desserts--many involving interesting flavor juxtapositions--are served in multiple courses
Though selections change daily, one might enjoy a lightly sweet brown-sugar panna cotta in a bath of dry prosecco; a delicious, deeply chocolatey tart with red-wine reduction and peppercorn ice cream; and an ethereal fromage blanc cake poised amid crushed ice
A "meal" consists of an amuse-gueule--a tart yogurt sorbet floating in lavender soup, perhaps--followed by one dessert and a petits-fours plate
The dishes are manageable enough that voracious diners may crave more than one
It was small, but in a relaxing setting
It was very personal, as greetings from the waiters, and personal farewells
The portions were very small, but the desserts taste wonderful
Not too pricy, nice to go after a play or a walk in the city
I was attracted to the concept, but this dessert bar tuned out to be a big dissapointment for me
I don't mind the small size of the dishes and the price is in an okay range
Yet, the taste of the desserts was so plain and boring that it even destroyed the taste of paring champaign
I heard some customers in the restaurant say it is cute (and it is), but did not hear anyone say it is delicious
There are many good cafes and bakeries around this hyped dessert bar, which are worth your time and money
personally, i love this place
there'r complaints about the potion is too small
well, i'm full after a whole meal, but it is not enough for savouring becuz it's too good! haha
but then i think they r very smart about it becuz if their portion is big enough to the customer's satisfaction, i don't think we'll be addicted to it as much
I always think about their dessert becuz after each time, i always feel like i want more, but of cuz i don't get more unless ordering another one
yet that's what keeping me thinking about it so much
seriously, if i eat till content, i would think about it afterward, but would've craved for it as much, so they r pretty smart about that! =)  how much is a bottle of beer, or a cocktail cost in a bar? i don't think Chikalicious is that expensive, even thou i'm not rich
the only place i don't mind waiting for an hour
Absolutely the best dessert I have ever devoured
Service was great and the staff was quite knowledgable
My girlfriend loved the fromage blanc, but if you love chocolate make sure you sample the pink peppercorn ice cream
The white chocolate mousse with rhubard and rhubarb sabayon was mouth watering, better than most white chocolate
The selection is overwhelming
have a little bit of everything you will not be dissapointed
Don't forget the house cocktail
great drink and the iced coffee will leave you energized
reallllllllllly gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
ChikaLicious takes you back in time
It is a beautiful trip down memory lane to a time when we use to bake from scratch, with our hands
Remember what real butter tastes like? I was joyously reintroduced
Don't plan on coming if you're in a rush
The line is out the door
This is all about good conversation, ambiance and paying homage to freshly prepared desserts
A real treat
My wife, associate and I enjoyed dessert at ChikaLicious on Saturday night, and from welcome to good night it was an exceptional experience
We were greeted promptly and shown to a wonderfulcounter seating a place of beauty, with modern archetecture and elaborate kitchen equipment
The service was perfect and our desserts were wonderful
I had perhaps the finest fromage Blanc Island Chees cakesalad - the cream seemed to melt in my mouth
brulle
When in the area, this is an eatery not to be missed
Believe all the bad reviews you read on this website about chikalicious
The rave reviews must be from people who get high off trendy places
I understand that many trendy couture restaurants serve really tiny servings at high prices
I'm okay with that but the desserts at Chikalicious are ridiculously tiny
You would expect something so tiny to atleast give you a good punch of flavor but everything was bland and common
First I thought $12 was cheap for a tasting but after experiencing it I wouldn't pay $1
The place is a gimmick and I have no idea how this restaurant received such good reviews and raves from patrons
My guests and I were all dissapointed
This is one of the very few eating establishments that use only quality, fresh, pure ingredients in all their wonderful receipes
In a culture where too many people these days settle for fast and/or processed foods, the quality of many local bakeries/pastries has declined markedly
ChikaLicious holds true to the real tradition of high standards with everything they make
Thank you ChikaLicious!
The real joy of this place was watching the ballet of Chika and her assistant create the wonderful desserts
Everything was done with precision - it was quite a sight to sit there at the bar and watch her work
We were mesmorized! When we asked the waiter about the cheesecake, he said, It's like eating a cloud
Wonderful imagery! The amuse (peppercorn gelee!), the desert the petit fours
a fabulous stop on a Sunday afternoon! Even though we ate at a burger joint for dinner, ending our meal at Chikalicious made us feel like we ate gourmet!
I have been going to ChikaLicious for about three years now and I absolutely love it! My friend told me that it would be compatable with my diet requirements without having to eat all of those chemicals
This is truly what keeps me coming back
It is a wonderful chill spot in the afternoons
Everything about it is wonderful
Not only are they open early, but they have awesome coffee, tea, and definitely dessert! Their tables are kinda small which makes it best for two people
I recommend the Fromage Blanc Cheese Cake
i just took a recruit out for dessert to this joint
been here a few times before

Then he said it was also because the printer in the kitchen didn't print the order
Yeah right
Our food was HORRIBLE
Pasta with vodka was so bad my date asked for hotsauce to give it any kind of flavor
My chicken was so dry it was like eating a piece of rubber
The veggies were also cold
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!
I love this place, and I'm not even a sports bar fanatic
Everything is brand new, and it's a huge open space with flat screen TVs over the bars and lots of seating room
It's nice and close to Madison Square Garden, and it's got the nicest waitstaff
There is an upstairs room for private parties, and if you are lucky, you'll get the table right in the front window, so you can people watch as you suck down your brews near the bar
The bathrooms are so CLEAN!  The only down side is that there is no one there really past 9:30 PM on a Friday night
just a few guys in suits and a lonely dude nursing his beer
I guess that's good if you just want to hang out with a few of your buddies, but if you are looking to meet people it kind of sucks
Admittedly, I was pretty put off by having to wait 45 minutes in line on a Saturday afternoon at 3:00pm
By the time I finally got my food I was expecting something really good
Ugh
I got the Shackburger, cheese fries and chocolate shake
The burger tasted like a Hardee's Thickburger except half the size, the fries were Ore Ida with Cheeze Whiz on top (yuck), and the shake was pretty good on a hot day but nothing to write home about
I can't understand why everyone loves this place
It's like mass delusion
The burgers, hot dogs, fries and shakes were all very good - like a suburban drive-in
It wasn't as pricey as I've heard, either
Just be sure to go on a slow day
The staff were very slow taking orders despite the long line
We ended up waiting 50 minutes for our food
Defeintely worth it for a 10-minute wait
Not for 50
Shake Shake has by the best burger in NYC, bar none
It makes the offerings from Mellons, Corner Bistro, PJ Clarkes et al seem flavourless and pedestrian in comparison
Danny Meier has nailed it: the mixture of brisket and sirloin, smothered in cheddar and Shack Sauce, makes for a juicy and irresistable filling
This is perfectly complimented by the bun, which is soft, fluffy and a touch sweet, and the toothsome tomatoes
The french fries are also very satisfactory, as is the 'shroom burger
I can't recommend Shake Shack enough
I hate hamburgers, hot dogs, and all condiments, so I was a little bit skeptical about going to a hamburger stand, even if it is amazing
Then I saw the menu item for their cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom burger, so I ordered it and it was INCREDIBLE
I want to go back HARDCORE
My first time here and the wait time was quite long - about 40 minutes and we didn't necessarily go during peak hours (at 4:15 pm), though to be fair it was a sunny Sunday afternoon and the rest of the park was packed
The burgers (got both the regular burger and the Shack burger) were the best I've had in awhile and the strawberry milk shake alone would have almost warranted the long wait
The fries, however, were just mediocre
All in all, glad I listened to the CitySearch reviews and checked this place out
Definitely worth the trip and the wait
The place is perfectly located in one of the parks corners
Very nice seating area which I could not enjoy because of the rain
I ordered the flagship product, the shack burger
I expected it to be bigger (it was smaller than a McDonalds quarter pound)
It was delicious, great meat quality and natural taste
Then I had a taxi hot dog which did not impressed me at all being the same as the street dogs
If you dont care about the calories, I definitely recommend the chocolate milk shake with your burger
I visited Shake Shack at 16h00 so it was not crowded at all although I understand it gets full at peak hours (lunch, dinner) so be prepared to spend some time in the line if you get there at those hours
Shake Shack is the taste of NYC
Its a must visit for any tourist looking to experiment urban tastes or a local looking for a casual-fast yet delicious lunch or dinner
Shake Shack is a great burger joint for the summer
Burgers are served juicy and perfect on a potato bun
Shakes, fries and your standard diner food are all really good
There are wines offered but, the wines are subpar and beers (which would make everything perfect) if the beers were cold
Overall, a PERFECT place to grab a bite to eat in the summer/spring
Lunch is a crazy time to go but, for late night, it's great
This place cannot be hyped enough
The burger is just unlike anything else you can find in New York city
Perfect on a sunday afternoon when the weather is nice
The line was ridiculous when I went, but I took this as a reassuring testament to the power of the Shake Shack burger
Worth the wait
And get a milk shake!
The burger is over cooked and expensive for what you get
The milk shake tastes like any other you can get anywhere
Line can be daunting
If there's no line, give it try just to satisfy your curiosity but you'll probably leave less than impressed
Yea, the line gets long, but if you read any of these reviews you know what to expect
Enjoy the park, enjoy the scenery, and get ready for truly the best burger you've ever had
Make sure you get a milk shake to compliment your burger and get ready for your taste buds to explode
It lived up to all of the good reviews listed
If you're in a hurry, go have it your way somewhere else! Great food AND reasonable prices
If you like standing on line for 40 minutes for an undercooked and overpriced burger, this is the place for you! Really though, I hate the Shake Shack
Every day I watch people lined up outside the Shake Shack like it's a ride at Disney World
People will literally spend their entire lunch break waiting and for what - an average fastfood burger
They must put some mind-controlling chemical in the food because that's the only way they'd ever get me to go back again
I paid almost $12 for a burger, fries and a shake
You could get the same thing at a diner for around half the price, and the burger will be bigger too
I'll give it to them - the shakes are good
But aside from that, don't let the long lines fool you - save yourself from becoming another slave to the Sheep Shack
So when I saw a 10
0 rating on citysearch, i had to try this place- i mean, it's a burger
how good could it be? the answer: really good
being from l
a
, i dont know if i can say it beats in n out, but it comes very close
burger itself was great, the bun was good, and the lettuce was amazingly fresh
shake sauce was delicious
there is of course, always a wait, but bring some friends or a book, and it'll go buy in no time
concreation was a little too sweet for me, but that just means i probably shouldnt have ordered it in the first place
i mean, it's ice cream- what do you expect?
ive been here a few times (always on a nice day) and its always been good enough to keep me coming back despite hour-long waits
definitely bring a friend/dog/book to keep you company if you decide to come here on a sunny weekend
offerings are limited but satisfying
burgers come well-done for everyone, but theyre so well-seasoned and juicy that there should be no complaints (shack burger with their special sauce is highly recommended)
burgers here are better than the ones at burger joint because shack buns are softer and chewier, giving a better overall mouth-feel
hot dogs are less outstanding, though the chicago dog does come with an impressive list of vegetable toppings
frozen custard concoctions are large and satisfying, with daily flavour offerings
menu is helpfully priced so that every order, with tax, rounds up to half or whole dollars so theres no annoying change

The place is so beautifull, the scene was like nothing i have ever seen before
The staff there was so friendly and organized
And the music was excellent
we felt so welcomed, the party was perfect, two of my friends had thier parties there also and they loved it
They had such a great mixed crowed
There was just one thing that i was kind of upset about, I had a friend who was 27 years old but they didnt let him in because he had no ID
But I recomend everyone to try this place out , i garentee you'll love it as much as we did
My friends and I had the WORST evening
We made reservations a week in advance and weren't informed that there was a private event going on that ruined our evening
We sat next to the microphone and heard screeching all night, and when we spoke to the manager all he could say was they are leaving soon, he totally ignored our comments and showed NO CONCERN for paying CUSTOMERS
no sorry, no comps
, NOTHING
HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! EVEN WORST MANAGER
I went there with a group of my friends and had an awful experience
The hostess failed to inform us of that the restuarnt was hosting a private company party when we made the reservation
Then she sat us right in front of the podium where the DJ was conducting a raffle game for the party
So during our entire meal, we had to listen to this woman yelling in front of us, on top of that, the microphone kept making this obnoxious feedback noise every 30 sec
When we complained to the manager, he simply informed us that the DJ was almost done and that we should be used to loud restaurants by now
He never even apologized! We are never going back to that place ever again!
We organized a party at this bar and have gotten very poor service
the bar owner promise to keep separate tabs on our private party and restrict the guest to the guestlist but he totally did not do what he promised
In addition, the bartenders were not friendly and courteous at all and gave ppl attitudes when ordering drinks
The ambience here is definitely played out
The bartenders used to be hot, but now there's some dude, and girl with NO personality
I've gone twice and the music was exactly the same both times
They might as well just get a cd player and save money on dj equipment
The owner's pretty creepy too
Avoid this place
To say that the well-hyped ambiance leaves a lot to be desired is a massive understatement
I have to hand it to the photographers who took the online pictures that you see
it isn't anywhere close to those colorful, texture-enhancing photos which you see
In fact, you just feel surrounded by campy, dirt-covered walls with a contrived finish
Another quick tell-tale sign is the furniture at the bar and the seating tables
I think they picked up their chairs and bar stools from a Bob Evans fire sale somewhere in central Ohio
But at least it matches the dime-store silverware you get which comes neatly wrapped in a cheap paper napkin
The food is okay, but nothing to write home about
In a nutshell, La Caverna suffers from an identity crisis, and was a let down to say the least
I went here with about 20 friends for my birthday
The doorman wouldn't let one of my friends in because he was waearing flip flops
Really, he was wearing sandals with socks
The place was way to crowded with a real bridge and tunnel crowd-not the hipsters I expected on the lowe east side
the music was fun but there was no room to dance, and the people were very rude
I don't recommend this place at all and it was a really cheesy scene
I've found myself coming here at least once a week since I first tried it
La Caverna tends toward the quiet side, so it's great for conversation over intimate dinners, or with large groups
DJs are excellent, seating is comfortable and the drinks are creative
The staff is always super friendly
Go for it
Love the space, love the food!  I have been 5 times now, and the food is always excellent ! I reccomend the la Caverna salad, Minnestrone soup, calamari, shrimp, and steak TOO!
The editor's review is ridiculous
I have been to La Caverna about 5 times, each time with the same experience
I have brought all my friends and even my family there
It's such a special and different kind of restaurant
The ambience is like nothing else in NYC and the food is always fabulous!!!!!  The friendly service is also a plus
Whoever says this place is not AWESOME, is NUTS!!!!!!!
I've been priveleged to have The Pump in my neck of the woods for a couple of years now, and I've been patronizing them since day one
And why? Well, what can I say about a restaurant with a takeaway menu completely devoid of sugar, butter, or deep-fried anything? That menu speaks for itself, as does the food as it's going down
simply fabulous
I've been eating at The Pump for five years now and the food is aways top notch
The portions are generous
Its the one place I know I will get exactly what I want
Excellent Clean Food
My favorite thing on the menu is the Lean and Mean, grilled lemon chicken over steamed spinach topped with vegetarian chili
It powers me through the day
If you are into fitness give this place a try
I guarantee you will get hooked the first time
This food always makes me feel great
And they deliver
Not only does their food taste so good that it makes you want to cry, but it is perfectly filling and you don't feel sick after eating it because it has the perfect combination of proteins, nutrients, carbs and vitamins
I order every night at work from them and then I order three times a day from them during the summertime when I am training for my ironman
Everything from their food, to their efficient and professional staff makes me love ordering from them
And don't you just love the costumes they wear when passing out fliers!
I have never had such fresh food in my life
There is no other place like it
Their food is delicious and I always feel just perfect after I eat it
Some items take longer than others
When I am in a rush I usually get a cup of lentil soup, which is like a complete meal
The Pump restaurant is excellent
As a comic book artist, I need a lot of energy to draw all the superheroes I create
I eat at The Pump everyday for energy
Sine I'm a freelancer, I'm always around the city so I eat at all their locations, and they all provide the same great food
The food is packed with power and is so delicious! My favorite is the dynamite chicken sandwich (#42) - great food for enrgy on the go!!
In all my years eating at The Pump everything has always been fresh and delicious
I love the grilled chicken salad, the baked tofu salad, the lean and mean, the lentil soup, and the humus
The service is very friendly
I just wish they delivered to my location
I looooove The Pump! I can't live without their wonderful and FAST delivery
The staff is the hardest working, and they always have a smile
Everything I have ever eaten there has been fresh and hot (in-house and delivery)
Finally
a good-for-you restaurant that in convenient too!
the pump is the best thing to hit manhattan-where esle can you get an egg white omelette and salad for $6
00
The food is clean, healthy and delicious and doesnt make you feel guilty about your money or your waistline
I think more than the quality of the food, this restaurant needs to work on the attitude of its staff
The host and his crew were horribly rude and non courteous
We were told to wait for 20 minutes but after waiting for more than 30 minutes( during the severe heat wave i might add) and seeing other people come after us get seated i decided to inquire about the status of our order
Was only the host not polite he was just abruptly rude
he said that we have to wait another 20 minutes as the table is not ready yet
Im not sure how good the food is, but am sure its not worth waiting one hour for in the presence of an absolutely obnoxious host staff

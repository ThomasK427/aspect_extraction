The pizzeria is a throwback to the days of the small pizza parlor and is frequented by friendly regulars
Even regulars who moved out of the area years ago come back for his legendary slice
So definitely stop by this pizza jointbut don't piss off Sal by ordering anything too complicated
Here, it's all about the pizza
And if you want pineapple on your slice, bring your own
Giardino's offers great Italian food at a very reasonable price
I have been going here for years
There portions are also very generous
They are the same owners of Carravelle Russo's on the Bay in Howard Beach
Nice place for small or large parties as well
They have a couple of rooms that you can rent for bridal/baby showers,anniversaries,etc
Giardino on Northern Boulevard is a good priced, decent proportioned place to eat at
Catering to families, couples and singles, it's nothing special, but the food has never stopped me from going back
Service isn't the best, but there's almost never a wait
My husband took me here for my birthday and I was pleasantly surprised
The restaurant was cozy with a very warm feeling
Our waiter was very nice and my house glass of chardonnay was light and refreshing
My husband tried the Italian beer and it was very good
I had one of the specials which was lobster in the shell
it was a full platter of lobster w/ a delicious garlic butter sauce
My husband had the Fettucine w/ shrimp, spinach, roasted garlic and plum tomatos which was light and delicious
The fettucine tasted like it was made at the restaurant
For desert the Tiramisu was fluffy and delightful~ We had a great experience there and would love to dine there again~
Typically I do not spend my time reviewing restaurants
I am simply too lazy
However, as a long term customer and a true lover of fine cuisine, I felt I owed this restaurant a sliver of my time
After 15 years of consistant visits I have never been anything less then mystified by the magic this kitchen conjures up
I have been priviliged enough to sample the finest food this city has to offer
Il Toscano deserves a true round of applause
Fresh, original, creative, absolutely delicious - Perhaps I would chose a table at this cozy Italian corner versus an NYC top 5? I must admit, however, I am a regular!
Read some reviews that seemed ok, so decided to take my girlfriend to this place for 1 yr annivesary
We had such a poor service encounter that I felt compelled to write a review for it
First, the food is okay
I've had better Italian, but I've also had worse
The ambiance is small and cozy, which wasn't too bad for a weeknight
But the service was simply horrible
The wait staff spent all their time catering to regulars they know well
We couldn't get our waters filled even after asking
It's hard to imagine worse service
So the bottom line? Don't go unless you're already a regular
Patoug is over priced for the food that it offers
It should offer a lunch menu
The Kebobs are sometimes undercooked
As far as take-out Chinese goes, this place is great
If you live in the area you will be hard pressed to find a better take-out restaurant
The servers are all friendly, sweet and after a few visits you will develop a nice relationship with them
Anthony's Restaurant is a diamond among Italian eateries
To say that the food is excellent would be an understatement
Fresh flowers adorn every table and there is a piano player Thursday evening to Saturday evening
The well trained and informative staff make the dining room work like clockwork
Prices are comparitive to other area Restaurants, not to mention the Prix Fix and Early Bird menues
The chef/owner takes the time to talk to his cutomers to make sure all is enjoyed
I have been to this establishment numerous times, and have enjoyed it each and everytime
In Short A low-key, friendly environment attracts plenty of families to this reliable chain
Kids in the big booths--often clutching free balloons and crayons--usually outnumber adults sitting at the bar
The menu offers filling American fare with no surprises, from mozzarella sticks and nachos to rollups and burgers
Entrees include steaks, fajitas and main dish salads
The calorie-conscious can select from a list of Weight Watchers-inspired dishes like mesquite chicken salad and grilled tilapia with mango salsa
Good food, great for large crowds, good service, usually worth the wait
There's plenty of parking in the lot behind the restaurant
This place has some awesome burgers
BE sure to try their Applebee burger
You will not be sorry
After all the years the bagels are still great, but since the renovation of the store the prices did not INCH up they JUMPED!!! I didn't know cream cheese got soooo expensive
Parking is still a problem, police don't bother you double parking unless they're trying to shop there!! Buses are a pain in the ***
The places that are rated ahead of this place only have that distinction because they are in Manhattan
But this place has been the gold standard for New York bagels for as long as I can remember
HH? You must be kidding
We have to say thank you to a friend of ours for recommending the Oasis
The bagels at Oasis are simply amazing
Wether coming home late and needing a snack to satisfy the munchies or an early morning breakfast treat, this is the place to get it at
For all you everything bagel lovers out there move quickly
We have to give this place two thumbs up
!
Some Manhattan bagels are pretty good and are well known because they're in the center of the city
Bagel Oasis is an obscure bagelry in the hinterlands of Queens, yet still makes the list
Everyone who ever lived near this place remembers those perfect bagels forever, and you can usually get them while they're still warm
Dropped by Saturday morning to pick up a few 'everything' bagels
It's been a few months since I've been here, the first thing I noticed is that the counter kids don't look familiar
No biggies there since it's a temp job anyway
BUT, the bagels taste different
It's slightly bigger but not in a good way
It lost some of that nice crunch on the outside
It's still a good bagel but why mess with perfection? What's up? new owners?
Whenever I visit anyone on Long Island they beg me to being them Oasis bagels
The taste is absolutley unique
All other bagels taste like cardboard campared to these
I actually hesitate to order bagels from anywhere else
It's worth the trip
Bagel Oasis has been there forever-and as someone who can not live w/o bagels, I count them as the best I have ever had- They make all their own spreads as well-the whitefish is amazing! The bagels are crusty, sweet, chewy and since they are open all night, nothing sits around for long! On St Patrick's Day, they even make green bagels to celebrate
No crazy flavors-just good old fashioned bagels like they should be!
Well, the only pizza on that block
But hey, they've been there since 1967 while other places have come and gone
I've been going there since I was
oh
4 years old? The two brothers are still there, probably everyday
The pizza is pretty good
Nothing stellar, nothing noteworthy as far as NYC pizza places go
which makes it pretty good as far as pizza in the world goes
I'm not sure if I've ever had any of their other food, though it has always looked pretty good

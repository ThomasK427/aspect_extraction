It is a little pricey, but worth it for special occasions
I would def
recommend going there at least once!
My son just took me to One If By Land for Mother's Day and I had one of the best meals of my life there!! The Beef Wellington and the Smoked Duck are absolutely divine!!!! And the Lichido (Lychee?) Margaritas they made us were like nothing I've ever had before
A must try
After our lovely dining experience at one if by land two if by sea last saturday, my fiance and I felt obligated to post a review
The food was as excellent and the service was great too! I was also impressed by their the selection of wines offered
Overall a great romantic evening and it was worth every dollar

I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend, and everything you've heard is true - the food is excellent (most people told me that only the beef wellington was, but I think it was ALL very good), it's very romantic, and the waitstaff is very professional
The only drawback is the price
Don't be fooled by the $69 per person - you add drinks/wine and you order one or two of the extra-cost courses, and it quickly becomes a $350 dinner for two
But if your pockets are deep - go there now!!
My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate my birthday and it really exceeded my expectations
Our waiter was amazing and his recommendations were great
Perfect for a nice date
Beautiful restaurant!
From the moment we walked in the door, my co-workers and I were totally enchanted by the ambience and hospitality we were met with
We had drinks by the bar before dinner (there's a great piano player)
The bar is large, lively with two great fireplaces and friendly bartenders
Dinner was wonderful
Three courses with lots of great choices
Our server was most helpful in our wine selections
I would highly recommend this restaurant
Although a lot of people were there for romantic reasons, just as many business people were dining and it was a totally comfortable atmosphere
Soup brought before wine, each plate slapped down in front of us the second the prior was lifted
Made for an overall frustrating dining experience
Although rated most romantic, I wasn't impressed
My table faced a mirror, kind of a cheesy accessory to a supposedly classy decor
Appetizer and dessert was good, I don't recommend the gnocchi
Overall overpriced for the quality of the food, the decor and especially the poor service
Go to one of the other great NYC restaurants!

My wife and I celbrated our anniversary at OIBL on a weeknight in Oct
When we arrived, we were seated immediately and soon after greeted by our waiter
He was courteous and professional and really knew the menu
I like to ask the waiter/waitress their opinion and our waiter was very helpful
The appetizer and entree were very good (not amazing) , the desert was fantastic
Our dinner (fixed price) plus a cocktail each was $180
A good price for a high end rest
in Manhattan
Went there for a birthday and it was glorious despite the $120/person tab
We had the table for the entire evening, the service was excellent and the food unsurpassed by anything I've had in awhile
Obviously, at this price it is not a regular dining experience for most people
But was it worth the price
I thought so
After hearing wonderful things, I decided to have my birthday dinner here
First, the place was SWELTERING - my boyfriend was SWEATING
We get our menus and order drinks
The waitress comes back and takes our order
3 minutes and we get appetizers
We then get drinks when we are almost done
After apps, 5 minutes and there's our entrees! My salmon was RAW
My boyfriend's pork was the saltiest thing
We barely touched our food - the waitress came over to ask what was wrong, and we said we felt extremely rushed
They take our food and plop dessert menus down
We sat at 7:00 and this was 7:25
We don't open the menus until 8PM
I ordered the souffle
Well, when it came out (3 minutes), it had FALLEN
Are you kidding me? NEVER AGAIN
The service was terrible, we were rushed, and the food was subpar
Tables are too close together, nothing romantic about, and the food is below average
I just don't know why this is the #1 romantic place to dine
Fantastic food
Fantastic service
I highly recommend this fine establishment! *****
One if by Land, Two by Sea is not all that it is cracked up to be
Yes, I agree that is a very romantic ambiance with the piano player by the window, the fireplaces, and candlelit dinners
However, the food is very bland I was extremely dissapointed
I have been to the restaurant before was not overly impressed with the food
But, the romantic old-world ambiance brought me back
Perfect place to dine when celebrating special occasions
It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for
Great ambience, not too dark, not too bright, good music and good service
Their lamb chops and the beef wellington were excellent, and for dessert - chocolate fondant and the goat cheese mascarpone to die for
Overall, we enjoyed the place and would highly recommend it
My husband and I went there last night to celebrate our 2nd anniversary
We had 7 oclock reservation and we were seated promptly
We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu
We both had the crab-scallop cake for the appetizer which was incredible, then for our entree, I had chicken and he had the salmon
Then dessert
We sat there for a long time wondering where our dessert was
He had ordered the Chocolate fondant cake and I ordered the Creme Brulee
They finally brought it out with candles on our plates and in chocolate was written Happy Anniversary on each of our plates
Too bad we didn't bring our camera
All in all, the experience was phenomenal
The food was delicious and the service was impecible
I'd go there again
Definitely what all the hype was about
After reading the few complaints it seemed that the writers of those complaints must have been in a different establishment than the one I know
The food, ambiance and service are all top notch
The prices were comparable to other NYC restaurants and the portions were more than adequate
I guess the disgruntled writers either wanted fast food prices for lobster or just were upset because their dates didnt end up back at their aparttments like they hoped they would
This was one of the worst dinners that my fiance and I have had in Manhattan in years
The food was flavorless and tasted and looked more like a TV dinner than top rated cuisine
We were seated upstairs and could barely hear each other due to the noise level
Bread was disappointing and wine is very over priced
Don't waste your time or money
Upon arrival, you immediately notice the piano by the bar

The only saving grace was the AMAZING pizza, truly it tastes like real Italian pizza
So, I 'll try my hardest to find another place with similar tasting pizza but better customer service, but might return depending on how bad my cravings get
I have been here before years ago and went on Saturday with my fiancee
To start off, the maitre'd tried to seat another couple before us, even though they arrived about 10 minutes after us
They were nice and told us to take the table anyway
After our abrupt waiter took our order, they never brought us any bread
When the pasta was brought out, they never offered us cheese or pepper
After a good few minutes, we were able to flag down one of the busboys
The waiter never came back to see how we were doing or how the food was
Needless to say, smallest tip we have ever left
So many better Italian restaurants in the area, who know how to provide proper service
Some friends and I stumbled into what appeared to be a cute and fun place to dine
The food was okay but the service was really bad
It's one thing to ask for your drink a few times, but finally bringing the drinks with the check is just plain bad, well after you are are done eating and feeling quite angry
The waiters were also deceiving
what was insisted on being a small pizza intended for one was big enough to share, especially if you have already ordered a bunch of other things from the menu
It was very annoying of them to keep hassling us to order more from the menu
Not really a peaceful and fun dining experience
I have been basically addicted to the pizza at Tiramisu
My favorite is the one that comes with spicy pepperoni
I usually get it to go, but I ate at the restaurant quite a few times and must say that it has a nice ambience and a very good service
Check it out for yourself, and you won't be disappointed
It was Saturday night
I met my friend and his fiance
I had chiken with mushroom sauce on the top with steamed vegetable and it was great
The portion was enough
I normally eat very light and I was happy because the food was not salty at all
Tiramisu is known for its pizza
I've heard from so many people its pizza was good
My friend's fiance had pizza and she loved it
I had a slice of hers and was good
The mood is little loud and people are yelling at each other
If you want to talk with your friend or romantic mood, don't ever go there
I couldn't hear what my friends said and they were right in front of me
Service?? soso, no personality but not bad
I was pissed off by one waiter because he said we must order $15 per person or more
I think food were good
But the tiramisu is above all averages
Love the way they perfect it
I have been there 6 times
I did not have bad service like others mentioned
Food was pleasant, service was a bit on the iffy side
We live in the area and have passed by this place many times, but it never looked that special
We finally decided to give it a try and we were very pleasantly surprised how good the food is
The decor is nothing special, but they have a decent wine list and the prices are good
This is a great little place--great food and very interesting rolls
One has peanuts in it and it is divine
Great to order from
Called for delivery from these geniuses
Ordered an 18 pizza and got a 9 pizza
18 doesn't even vaguely sound like 9! I'm surprised the food arrived at all given that Stoney McPot on the other end of the line asked for my address three times (and received it each time with surprise!) Turns out that we were lucky because we could barely make it through 9 of that craptastic pie
Thick, gummy crust and acidic sauce
The cheese calzone was dry, missing the ham and filled with more sauce than ricotta
The eggplant parm
hero was essentially a tasteless tube of mush
Stay clear of this place or at least heap on the pineapple to kill the taste
Are you kidding? This is the best slice I've had in NYC! Not too greasy, delicious and flavorful sauce, perfect crispy/chewy crust
Their chicken rolls are great too -- a little on the greasy side
This is no longer the great California Pizza Oven
It's got the same awning, but it's now a generic, crappy pizza joint
Beware!
Def the best fast pizza place in town
Crisp, hot crust with an aroma of a brick oven and the somewhat unusual toppings (sundried tomatoes)
As I said
YUM
With a name like California pizza oven one would really expect more of a westward style of pizza, not here, the pizza is standard NYC fare, however the quality and flavor I found to defiantly be above average
I would recommend it to anyone that is around the area and looking for some decent slice of some take out pie
Steam pouring off the open kitchen pots by the front door, this place means business
making noodles at a thousand miles per hour, if you think they're rude, it's only because you're slowing them down
Excellent lunch specials, sweet roast pork that cures any hangover, scallion pankcakes that are actually crispy, and soup that lasts a few meals
Mee is about noodles, freshness and speed, and you get it by the ton here
my husband alberto i come here every single nite for dinner
we cannot get enough of this place! the friendly chinese waitstaff is absolutely wonderful
the service is impeccable the food is sotto cinque! what more could u want than underpriced mouthwatering chinese food???
the best chinese food in the east village
the chow fun noodles and vegetable dumplings are fantastic and fresh! the other dishes like chicken with eggplant are pretty good too
the decor is nothing to write home about
actually its pretty terrible but the cheap food is worth it
plus they have some interesting dishes that most take out/casual places don't have
The food is decently priced but their dishes are oilier than most chinese restaurants
Also, they are rude
Great place for a quick, cheap, tasty feed
Try the scallion pancakes!!
the infused vodkas is enough reason to try this place out! the mushroom ravioli was savory
We've been there a couple different nights
The Russian Peasant Beef is great comfort food on a cold night
We tried their blackberry vodka infusion
Yuck
I would only recommend the Lychee one
My wife and I got a small carafe after our wine which is a lot for two people (8-9 shots) so we were pretty much wasted when we left
The service was ok at best
Our waitress was an expressionless zombie
Overall, it's small, cozy, and has great live music on Friday and Sat
nights
Stumbled across Anyway Cafe one Sunday evening whilst walking in the lower east side
decided to go in for a drink
Not particularly busy but I liked it, live music, nice ambience, cosy place and pleasant staff
A mellow place for a quiet Sunday evening
My friends and I came there one Friday night, the place was EMPTY! There were about 10 of us and they didn't have enough plates for everyone
Then, after spending 3 hours there and ordering more than $400 of food and drinks we were KICKED OUT! They took away our food and drinks before we were done

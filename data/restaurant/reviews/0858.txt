Just a tip-their sauces seemed a bit heavy on the salt - be careful if that's not your thing
I was eating here last Friday
Excellent, tight presentation skills on behalf of their entire staff
Great atmosphere
Tables are a bit too close so we just ate outside
The grilled angus steak was scrumptious
Large portions also
Service was unbelievably on target down to the smallest detail; our waiter invited us to sample a new desert under consideration for their menu and a new line of ice wines
And yes, the chocolate fondue was superb! The place is a great find in this city price-wise as well
My boyfriend proposed to me last Saturday! I had no idea that history was about to unfold while savoring with my chocolate fondue dessert
The owner came over and toasted our engagement and gave us a bottle of bubbly on the house
The perfect romantic setting
When my group of three arrived, being seated by our hostess was clearly her highest priority amidst juggling tasks and taming a busy streak
The garden looked magnificent; love dining outdoors The waiter did right by us by pairing our order with a suitable wine
High class and high standards are surely in place
I plan on returning again and again
The restaurant was just lovely; it pleased even my fickle husband
Loved the service, music and lighting - most of all, I loved the garden - one can't help but feel sexy in this environment
This restaurant deserves the praise it has been receiving of late; the ambiance, service and food were remarkable
The menu and wine list offer excellent choices at moderate pricing
I was most impressed by receiving no non-sense service! No attitude, neither sluggish nor rushed - perfect balance
I dined at Andavi a few days ago with friends
This place is simply  amzing
The ambiance was perfect
We opted to dine in the outdoor  courtyard which is in the back of the restaurant away from Christopher street
Definitely check this place out-It is really hip and is certainly  affordable
My recommendation, lobster ravioli and the poached pear  dessert
A friend I came here for dinner
The waiters were conversational yet not overbearing
The salads were wonderful and the pastas exceptional
I highly recommend this place for a romantic evening
Andavi heads the list for going Italian in this city
I'm reading these reviews and can clearly agree that their service is the crowning glory of a well-earned reputation
I was embarrassed when I knocked my glass over
So was my date
The owner was more than happy to replace it at no cost
I just hope they remember me as the good tipper and not the klutz who spills glasses!
Nice authentic Italian experience
Good food, young vibe
Speedy service
The garden seating area was especially nice; classy, beautiful and memorable
Pastas and veal dishes are particularly good and not overdone
Service is superb and friendly
I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat
I love going to Andavi
Our experiences are always consistent
The owner circles the place asking patrons if their meals are fine
Excellent show of class for New York City
Well, I must try Andavi for lunch
I have had dinner there twice and  both times i was delighted with everything
The service was impecable,  our waiter was very attentive
Both times I opted for the priced fixed  4 course meal
I work in the city not too far from where andavi is  located so I think next time I will try their lunch specials
While we were seated considerably fast on what appeared to be a busy night, there's a very limited bar space to wait at
The level of hospitality was amazing from beginning to end, with the maitre de, staff and particularly the owner who was delightfully engaging customers throughout our entire stay! She assisted us in selecting a wine that went best with our meal
Food was excellent, vibe was good, but hats off to the service!
My friends and I had a nice time
We're a group of four, and eat out enough together to know that waiting for tables at restaurants is inevitable
So imagine our surprise when we were seated so quickly, and that's three times and going (hopefully!) Andavi has an excellent atmosphere, everyone is so nice, and you'll easily pay south of $50 for dinner for two
The food is wonderful and the Hershey kisses in the grand vase up front adds just the cutest touch!
I was more impressed with the food, service, and wine selections at Andavi than any other restaurant I've been to this past year
The vegetable primavera appetizer was amazing as was the Hazelnut Salmon
Our waiter was clearly at our beck-and-call
I will surely come back here soon
This is a great place to dine with an impressive menu
The food is excellent quality and the service stands out
The place was packed and while our food took time to be prepared, our waiter earned points for his sparkling conversation to pass time and for also knowing practically every ingredient of every special under consideration
He also assisted with choosing a wine best suited for our meal
Molto impressivo! The service and experience were most excellent
From an amateur critic's perspective, Andavi is an ideal spot to dine
The food is well prepared and they provide you with the choice of indoor seating or outdoor within this luxurious garden display
The staff is extremely attentive and they have an impressive wine list, with a selection literally spanning Europe
It's definitely a hot spot to host a date or bring clients
my parents and i went to andavi to celebrate my birthday
the food was great and the waiter (Mo) surprised us with fondue as a birthday treat (and a very yummy one at that)
the food was delicious (i got the rack of lamb with honey mustard sauce)
i would definitely go back - especially for the chocolate fondue
Andavi is probably my favorite restaurant in NYC! The atmosphere is great for almost any occasion!I'm now a regular
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great Italian restaurant
This restaurant is a step above most Village restaurants and is a great value
We went the night before Valentine's Day and everything was perfect
Our waiter was a little stressed and brought a couple things out late and as a result, he apologized graciously and gave us wine on the house to compensate for the delay
I definitely recommend the chicken with brie
I can't say enough about Andavi and its staff, specifically Ryan
first dined here during lunch w/ a friend on New Year's Day and was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the food was for the price (fresh pasta dishes served piping hot for less than $6!)
Recently, planned a surprise 30th bday dinner for the same friend on a Friday evening - all I can say is AMAZING! All of the guests raved about the food and Ryan (our server) was fantastic - he not only volunteered to pick up the bday cake from nearby Magnolia but he added to my guest of honor's surprise by presenting w/ candles and quick song! At the end of our evening, he cut and bagged up the cake so that she could take it w/ her for her night on the town! I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ENOUGH! It's a real jem of a find!!
My friends and I LOVED this place! The atmosphere is relaxed
The food is great and very reasonably priced
The service was wonderful--Mo was such a great waiter and laughed at Cliff's horrible jokes
The dessert wine was great too--we loved the ice wine! I will definitely go back again soon
Portions are generous and very filling indeed
Andavi is cute, but a bit crowded at times as your elbow can touch the person at the next table
The food at Andavi was excellent and the service was excellent
We came to the village to see a play we had lunch at Andavi
We liked the restaurant any Ryan so more we had to come back after the show to have dessert which was great also
Ryan was the best he made us laugh and he told us about places to go and see
Well we will be coming back for the food and service and the reasonably price it is a very nice place
Upon walking to the restaurant I knew I had made a good choice
Hostess was very pleasant and the ambience was fantastic! Food was great
I recommend the hazelnut, herb-crusted salmon

The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies
Unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal
The Scene There's nothing serene about this noisy scene
Horns, hides, wagon wheels and wood beams decorate the white-washed room, which is packed with Upper East Side professionals kicking off their boots after a hard day's work
Service copes well enough with the crunch, but at times they seem like they'd rather be anywhere else
The Food Though the drink-centered scene feels themey, the food is a cut above your usual cocktail canteen
Mellow goat cheese merges wonderfully with spicy poblano chile in a quesadilla; a mixed grill with chicken, shrimp, sausage, swordfish, and steak covered in a complex sweet-and-hot mole can feed a couple of hungry cowhands; and the grilled rare tuna comes with a trio of salsas (mango, papaya, and tomatillo) that stir the taste buds like a cattle prod
But what will make you really want to scream "Yee-haw!" are the sopapillas--fried apple turnovers topped with vanilla ice cream
Uncouth wait staff, negligent bartenders
Slow service
Took one hour to receive appetizers
To their credit they comped one of them but still the evening was a let-down due to non-existent service
The salsa always tastes like V8 with onion pieces
But it was all worth it for a while, because the food is tasty and fresh
But the awful service has finally caused me to blacklist this place
Going back to Rosa Mexicana
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for? Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out
Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining
We have gone at least once a week for the past year and it is consistently good
Serivce can be slow sometimes, and it can be a bit noisy on a crowded night
The frozen margaritas are excellent - the Goat Cheese Nachos are outstanding
Overall a great price performer
Definbately stop by here for some powerful Margharitas
The knock you flat
But if you just want to stop for food, its also a good choice
A large menu selection and attentive servers make sure you end up full
I've been here several times and you won't find better food for your money anywhere in the city
The duck burrito with mole sauce is out of this world and the prices are definitely affordable $12-16 for most entrees
A few of the fish dishes are a little bit more
Canyon Road, without a doubt, serves the best margaritas and chicken nachos in the City! I lived in the area a few years ago and it became a staple in my diet
Now, back in Oregon, everytime I drink a margarita, I get nostalgic for my next vacation
The food, drinks, atmosphere, and service are all reasons to try this place!
Great ambience
Good drinks, good food and the wait staff is very helpful and courteous
I highly recommend it for a romantic evening or for a good crowd to start off an evening with margaritas!
The Scene The bruising thoroughfare that is East 57th Street is the last place you'd expect to find an intimate, adorably decorated Northern Italian spot where it's actually possible to have a quiet, pleasant dinner
But plenty of stylish locals have discovered its polite charms
The Food The straightforward menu is filled with hearty preparations such as a rustic appetizer of lasagnette di melanzane, filled with layers of diced eggplant, zucchini and tomato
Main courses include a list of housemade pastas, a daily risotto special (if you're lucky, you'll arrive on wild mushroom day), plus a handful of fish and meat dishes
Be sure not to miss the fritto misto, a huge entree composed of shrimp, squid and various vegetables served in a "basket" of homemade potato chips and garnished with fresh lemon
Molto bene! This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate
A guaranteeed delight!
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora
Bad service
Our party of 3 adults and 1 infant was asked to relocate to the second floor after we were all seated
The second floor was much more spacious and so we decided to overlook the incident
Later,the same waiter carelessly shoved an extra chair from another party against the back of my chair until the 2 chairs clanked
I was mortified
Foodwise, my Tagliatelle was heavy handedly seasoned
My profiteroles were a soupy mess, I contemplated sending them back
The best thing about this place was the spaciousness of the second floor, however good restaurants aren't usually renown for their square footage
Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered
Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain
We all ate pasta entre'es, which were great
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch
Try the lasagnette appetizer
Buon appetito!
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle
A real dissapointment
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies
Priced at upper intermediate range
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked
From the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in the perfect place
Everyone who works there (the host, the bartender, the servers) is so helpful
And the food is fantastic
Favourites include: potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb
I once ordered the risotto special, which was with prosciutto and parmesan, and the prosciutto was barely noticeable, but that was the only negative aspect I've ever encountered there
decent joint, service was nice, and food came at appropraite intervals
I had the tuna tartare appeizer, was a bit oliy, but it was pretty good
The pasta with lobster was not bad, but the sauce could have used a bit more umph
Overall, a good palce for a casual date, or with your parents
The only knock is that it is easy to eavesdrop on other tables
The wait staff was very helpful and friendly
I wish I had one nice thing to say about the food, but I dont
The food is overpriced and not very good
The baked penne came out in a small bowl, burnt with barley any sauce for $18
Save your money the food certainly isnt worth it
For a fairly pricey restaurant, they have some strange quirks
A hamburger is priced at $10
75, yet they feel the need to add $
25 if you want cheese- what's the point? That doesn't even pay for the cheese!! And the buffalo calamari (soggy calamari with buffalo wings sauce) came in a very generous portion, but with only three small sticks of celery on the side

In the summer time, its cold ramen goes really well with a Japanese beer
This cheap casual restaurant offers modern deco, great food, friendly staff with affordable price
Dinner time is better
They have candles and fashinable Japanese foods with lazz music! Fantastic!
This place has great food
My boyfriend and I have been going here since it first opened (we live a block away)
The spicy miso menchanko is the best noodle soup there and is great comfort food
The appetizers like the fried oysters were very tender, light and juicy that my mouth is watering as I'm writing this
The fried soft shelled crab is delicate and tasty
The sushi is presented very artistically with different special sauces that add a great unique taste to it
The ambience is cozy and rather romantic
The best thing is that the food is not very expensive at all (even on a college student's budget)
a bowl of noodles at this place is the scrumptiously perfect answer to a cold winter's day
definitely try the spicy miso soup
it's the best i've ever had
the staff is friendly and attentive, the decor is really minimalist and stylish, and the prices are quite reasonable!
Ony offers great food
i had the pork noodle soup
it was excellent
they decorate their food very elegantly
it has cozy ambience
After passing several restaurants with waits for outdoor seating, we surprisingly stubmbled upon Le Clown while going from 3rd to 2nd Avenues
We figured we would try it, and WOW were we happy! The food was EXCELLENT (from the foie gras to the steak and mussels)
Atmosphere service were great and the value was impressive
A hidden treasure on the UES
Hopefully the word won't spread to widely
its a great neighborhood spot!
luis, the manager, will treat you well in this classic french bistro
he'll recommend the best wine with your food and tell you whatever else you want
the food is as french as you can get
we had the lamb chops, the calf liver, the lobster bisque
i think anything you order would be splendid here
An excellent bistro with quite gregarious staff! As for the food, superb! I'm planning to attend today to celebrate Bastille Day!
Le Clown is a cozy, intimate place for enjoying great authentic French food served in a friendly, cordial ambience, without French attitude My recent experience at Le Clown left me with a irresistable desire to come back to enjoy its superb food and its well prepared Martinis with mucles
Chef Bertrand and his staff turned marvelous, succulent deserts to finish the evening on a sweet memorable note
After dinner, the people at my table had the opportunity to talk with Chef Bertrand who gracefully stopped by our table inquiring about our dinning experience
Highly recommended
Excellent dining experience
I give Le Clown snaps!
Poor service?!?! I beg to differ
the wait staff at Le Clown was absolutely wonderful
My glass was never empty, and smiles were abundant
The food there is magnificent, and the setting is perfectly intimate
A great experience I highly recommend!
I feel compelled to write a review regarding my experiences at Le Clown Bistro; after I read the review posted by Hoya
After several months of dining at Le Clown, I have found this french bistro to be nothing but consistently delicious
The food is exquisite and the service is always vivacious
Le Clown offer fabulous meals at very reasonable prices; the mussel entrees are only $15
The menu is diverse, yet not overwhelming
The Creme Brule (apologies, no accents) is out of this world  This is a small, French bistro; noise is expected
This is becoming our families standby, and we are looking forward to a beautiful spring dining on Le Clown's outdoor patio
Not just your average French Bistro
I recently dined here and was extremeley pleased with the outstanding food and service
Alain and Rupert bent over backwards to make sure everything went right with our meal
The artwork in the restaurant is intriguing and compliments the decor nicely
Worth the trip uptown!! i'll be back
Le Clown restaurant provides a genuine and alluring French cullianary treat in a city filled with imposters
At Le Clown I at last have discovered a truly French French restaurant and have returned three times already in two weeks
The food is out of this world, totally amazing, wherever I go on the menu the result has been exquisite
The service is as warm and welcoming as the decor of this hidden treasure which has a remarkable and extremely pleasing display of miniture original paintings and drawings by a number of NYC artists exploring and reflecting the theme of Clowns
Overall a guaranteed superb French Bistro experience
If you want good quality bistro food at reasonable prices - then this is the place for you
More importantly (it is French after all) the wine list is excellent, with prices to suit all pockets
The staff are friendly (although I'm not sure if that's traditional) and although the service is prompt you never feel hurried
This adds to the warm atmosphere which makes Le Clown a great place to catch up with friends
or just that one special friend
I'll definitely be making a return visit
I've tasted probably every ice cream on the market, and I've been to most ice cream parlors in NYC, and this modest parlor serves some of the best you'll have
NOT pretentious ice cream, not gourmet, not trying too hard to impress, not full of wacky ingredients (tuna fish flavor, garlic
you know what I mean), just delicious, soft, creamy, fun, reasonably priced NY ice cream to grab along the way, with a large menu of flavors
The way a neighborhood ice cream joint should be
And all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice
In Short This lovely but casual spot puts its own whimsical spin on traditional tea service
Mismatched furniture and fine china make it clear that it's okay if you're not wearing your Sunday best
You'll find four tea services of various sizes, including one for kids
All include a choice of more than 110 brews, fresh sandwiches and scones with clotted cream
There's also a choice of salads
Desserts include rich chai creme brulee and mocha chocolate chip cake
the rave reviews this place gets is none other than mind-boggling
i visited alice's tea cup on 7/25/06, and the service that day was poor
the staff plops the food down in front of you, and it took two requests for the 80's rock music to be turned down
any restaurant can have its off day, but what excuse can be given for the dark and unimaginative decor? with a few painted murals, it's hardly the wonderland experience everyone raves about
the food was pretty nice, but it's on the expensive side
Alice's Tea Cup has the best scones! Any chocolate chip flavored ones are excellent
Service is excellent, and having tea with scones is a delightful experience
The only negatives are the very very long waits on weekends for brunch
The chairs could be a little more comfortable, but I think they match the charming decor
It seems a lot of men shy away from the restaurant due to its extra girlyness (the waitresses have fairy wings), but that means more food for the ladies!
wait is long on weekends, but thankfully they take your cell number so you can shop in the area while waiting for their call
my group of 4 got the jabberwocky which comes with scones, !!unlimited!! sandwiches, and assorted cakes and cookies
theres absolutely no need to get that set
the normal mad hatter is enough to overly satisfy
scones are warm and come with clotted cream preserves
the fruit scones were really good, but the maple cinnamon chocolate chip were too sweet
sandwich bread is too dry and none of them were that great
their tea encyclopedia is impressive i stopped at A for alices blend but there are hundreds to try! be prepared to sit among whiny babies and hop over strollers on your way to the bathroom
overall, an ok place for afternoon tea or brunch, and a decent value (we paid $27pp)
A perfect place where I would love to go with someone very special or just by myself to spend some quality time and enjoy the amazing Tea!
With a tea list of over 100 teas, and the most amazing scones served with jam and clotted cream, how can you go wrong? The sandwiches are merely decent, but everything else is phenomonal; including the waitresses who are the friendliest, sunny-est girls you'll ever meet
Highly recommended

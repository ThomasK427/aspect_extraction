We enjoyed the fast moving, louder, festive ambience
If you are looking for romantic, this may not be the choice
Me and a friend were originally looking for a Japanese buffet called Minado, but we were told it was closed at 10! So we ended up at CP
I cannot describe how impressed I was with the place itself (for a pig-out place its neat and classy) LOVED the band! The salad bar was AMAZING! and they have SUSHI too (hear that Minado? and they are open till midnight!!!) The meat was sublime! I had mostly lamb and fillet mignon and they were both incredible, so soft, tasty
just perfect! Please don't miss the fried bananas they they bring with your meat
they are to die for!! Caipirinhia was great, but on a tiny glass
to wrap up, I'll just say this: THIS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST CULINARY EXPERIENCES IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
And the green-red flipping game is a lot of fun ! Will DEF go back ASAP!!
We were very impressed
I stuffed myself to the gills for $80
00 (not counting before dinner drinks) and please pay attention to the following
DO NOT FILL UP ON SALAD BAR AND CHEESE BREAD!  When the meat comes it is phenomonal and you will wish that you starved yourself for a whole day like I did
The waiters are classy and pleasant and our Maitre D was exceptional
This restaurant climbs to the top of my list next to Carmine's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone is alive at this little Brazil(Brasil) Mecca
The Churrascaria Plataforma is one of the best resturants in New York City
The atmosphere alone would rate it a 10
but wait til you taste the food! and it just keeps on comming for one flat price
so dont eat all day and stuff yourself silly when you go! try the ciparinea (spelled wrong im sure) but its wonderful
TIP: do not over indulge on the salad bar
yes its exciting and you want to try everything (they even have sushi) but there so much food to be had later just take small amounts of things
the best is yet to come!
The food is really fantastic, so is the service (and the wine list - or book, I suppose - is top notch), though it can be pricey
I recommend going for a late lunch (last lunch seating is 3:30)
You'll have the place practically to yourselves (plural because you really should go with a group) and with the amount of food you get it makes an effective dinner
Another bonus to eating early is that it's much cheaper
I have done the top-shelf open bar for $100, but in hindsight wouldn't do it again
If I had to go for dinner, I'd go with the unlimited wines-by-the-glass, their selections are not your run-of-the-mill merlot and cabernet, there's about 15 choice that are all great value wines
This place has the best service I have ever seen in the city
They ensure that you are stuffed beyond belief
To do this, they give you a place holder
red means buffet, which was sushi, pastas, breads, cheeses, salads, or Green which was BRING THE MEAT
My advice, just stick with the meat
They have about 10 different kinds and my favorite was the flank steak
The staff did a great job of keeping bottles and beers flowing on the table and ensuring that as long as you had green on, you got meat stuff with meat stuffed with tacos
Only bad thing was that we waited 30 mins to be seated and they made us leave 30 min early for free beers at the bar
At that point though it didn't really matter as we were all stuff!  Great frenchy coat wearing with ties and first date atmosphere!
Compared to the real Brazilian BBQs found in Brazil, Plataforma is a complete joke
It is extremely expensive, service is poor, they will serve you the minimum unless you complain
Having said that, the meat is good, the salad buffet is ok
But don't get fooled, they will come to you like crazy during 5 minutes serving you the poor and inexpensive meat so that you feel full immediately
Unless you are Brazilian, you don't know what the real good stuff is, and they will do their best to keep it away from you!
Service from the meat cutters is fine, but otherwise is below average -- they messed up the drink orders for 2 of the 10 I was with
we asked for more bread twice and it never came
etc
The food quality is great
fantastic salad bar (great if there is a non red meat eater in the group but
not good for vegetarians since much of it has seafood, cheese or other dairy
and the meat is fantastic
, Interior is a bit cheesy
you sort of feel like you are in the dining room on Love Boat
I was eating alone, so promptly seated
The extensive salad bar was filled with delicious offerings, but beware of filling up on the cheap eats
save room for the meats
The lamb and the tenderlion are amazing
The wine list was very good, but pricey
At 50 a head plus a couple of glasses of wine, be prepared tp have an expensive night out, but well worth it for a great Churrascaria
When I first heard about this place, I knew that I had to go
As a steak lover, it sounded like my dream
However, when I showed up for my reservations, I had to wait for over an hour to get in (on a Thursday night)
The restauraunt is extremely crowded and the only time I've been in such close quarters with other diners is at a comedy club
The food as a whole is mediocre
There are some very good items, but they seem to circulate the average ones the most
Considering the price, a regular steak house is a better choice unless you're truly ready to make the most of all you can eat
The meats keep coming and coming until you can't help but loosen your belt
For first timers, pace yourself, you don't have to eat everything they offer! A carnivors dream!
My husband printed out the from your website no mention of cost ($49
95 a person) nor did they inform us of price
I ordered ice tea and asked if I can get can get more; they bought another glass but did not inform us that they don't do refills on ice tea nor was desserts not included either
My husband notice as we got the bill that the number on the table had in small red letters, drinks and desserts were not included
Most restaurant we go to asked have you been here before if not this is how it works here, etc
etc
Unfortuanately for us we treated the other couple and boy did it blow our budget!  Otherwise it was a great meal -- buffet is one of the nices selection, the meats were teriffic, turning over the disc was interesting just more communication to the new patrons
I don't know where in the city can you find such an amazing deal for pitchers of caipirinhas and such amazing prices for huge slabs of perfectly executed cooked beef! A total bargain!
If you don't know what a rodizio style churrascaria is, I'm not going to ruin the surprise (read the other reviews)
If you do, then Plataforma will make you incredbily happy
The food, service, and atmosphere hold their own with any churrascaria I've been to in Sao Paulo or Rio
Authentic food and presentation, delicious picanha, and a very generous (and unneeded) buffet make Plataforma a sure bet for the churrascaria enthusiast
This place is great
My friend I loved the salad bar
We would've been content w/ just the salad bar
The meats were excellent
Seasoned just right
The side dishes (rice, beans, polenta) were good too
The atmosphere and service were wonderful
Since, it's just across work, I'll definitely be back
It is pricey, but worth it
Everytime I come here I am never disappointed
This place is great for groups and those with healthy appetites
I absolutely love the food here--the salad bar has a wonderful variety, the meat always tastes fresh, and the side dishes are delicious
The service here is also very good
The waitstaff is always friendly and accomodating
Worth every penny!
Although I'm a meat lover I quickly realized there was no way I could possibly eat $46
95 worth of beef, chicken and fish
The salad bar is is huge as is the line waiting to get at it (expect to spend at least 15 minutes waiting in line on a busy night), the place is beyond noisy and was so crowded that it took me nearly ten minutes to work my way through the mob to get to the mens room downstairs
WHAT A ZOO! The meats were unspectacular, all pretty much tasting the same and ran the gamut from fatty and chewy to just O
K
There were no stand outs
The salad bar was impressive but again, all things considered, hardly worth the money

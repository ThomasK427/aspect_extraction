We waited about 20 minutes, but it was worth it
We ordered the tea for two and were brought out a wonderful pot of tea and a three tiered tray of delicious sandwiches, scones, and other sweets
We walked away full and satisfied
The space is extremely small and your sitting on your neighbors lap, but worth it for the food and charm
A very good place to enjoy British style tea
The food is very tastey and they carry a number of items for vegetarians
They do not accept reservations, and have a policy of rushing people out when there is a number of people waiting
However, the food and tea still make the experience worth while
English restaurants these days are well designed, and have always been clean
This place is FILTHY and it looks like the interior of a shed ! What a mess ! And when you come out the smell of welsh rarebit clings to you like, well, a bad smell
The food is nice, but then its pretty hard to screw up Myers sausages, mashed potatoes and tinned beans isn't it ? The staff are usually pretty rude and everything is way overpriced
Only come here if you are English and desperate
It's cozy and cramped and also has 'rules' that patrons are required to abide by; one of them being an $8
50 min order
Considering TS's small size and the fact that people may be tempted to sit and sip tea all day long, the rules are understandable BUT they're still a bit of a turn off - a tad bit too fascist for my liking
Still, it's not a bad place
Service was quite decent - very British - no beating about the bush with this lot; if they need the space, they'll tell you to move
Not a big fan of English food but I do love English tea and that they seem to do pretty well
Definitely worth going to once, but not the kind of place where I'd become a regular
Never knew that tea could be so fantastic until I had a cup of the blackberry tea at TS and now I'm in love! Mismatching teapots and teacups, 10 tables crowded into a tiny room, friendly funky British wait staff, and British food that actually tastes pretty good
I've been lucky enough that I haven't had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table
Very cozy and quaint place to catch up with a friend over tea and cakes, or salad and meatloaf pie
I've heard that Anna Sui is a big fan, and TS are supposedly publishing a book on the shop
Came here around 9-ish on a Monday night to grab dinner w/ a friend
There was one table (out of 9 total) available for us, but we were so close to the table next to us where the couple was making out that it was a bit awkward
Service was ok - not great, and my mushroom shepard's pie was ok
My friend's mac cheese was a little better
Chocolate cake for dessert was dry and not very rich
I've been told this place is better for brunch, but w/ cramped surroundings and lackluster food, I'll book a flight to London before I return to this British stop
Tea Sympathy is quaint, cute and dainty with a good selection of leaf teas (which you can get by the pot with infuser) and probably THE BEST macaroni and cheese in New York
This place is tiny, so be prepared to be waiting outside for available tables
Once inside, expect to be sitting extremely close to strangers
The prices are good and the wait staff are harried but friendly
If you yearn for traditional English food, and you are not claustrophobic, this is a great place
I went to Tea Sympathy for the first time yesterday
I'm an extremely fickle 15-year-old who usually hates anything and everything that isn't Italian or fast food
But I loved this resturant
Although it is small, we went around 2:30 and it wasn't that crowded
I enjoyed it and i hope you do too!
I am English
I eat here all the time because it has all that is best about an english cafe
It is small but the food is worth it
If only they would serve cheese and pickle sandwiches in the evening
Anyway, Try Everything :-)
Highly recommened
You come here for the food, but the experience may make you think twice
The cheese and pickle sandwiches and the cream teas are lovely, and will warm the heart of any homesick Brit ex-pat or Anglophile
But it's just so tiny, you're practically sitting on your neighbor's lap, and the servers can be nice, but are often overwhelmed and cranky
This tiny cafe (or caff if you're going for full-on Blighty realness) serves up British comfort food that is as close to the real thing as you're going to get in NYC
Expats will revel in beans on toast and Welsh rarebit smothered with branston pickle--all knocked back with properly prepared pots of tea or British drinks like Ribena or Irn Bru
Yes it's bland, fattening, and a carb nightmare: that's the point
Expect playful cheekiness from owner Nikki and staff
This tiny restaurant in the West Village is great place for afternoon tea, some Welsh rarebit or scones with potted cream
The salad portions are big as well as desserts
The vegetarian and regular shepherds pie are unfortunately a little on the bland side
Do read the sign on the door, they are very clear on their seating policy
Best bet? Avoid the place during rush hours and go at off-peak times, between lunch and dinner for example
It'll make your dining experience more pleasant and the wait staff less stressed out
came here with a bunch of friends on sunday night
i ordered the lobster paella ($16) the ginger chicken ($11)
both dishes were very spicy
the paella was loaded with seafood, including a long green pepper stuffed with lobster
though novel, the seafood was overcooked, so it was dry chewy
the rice was very strongly curry-flavoured
the ginger chicken was flavourful but again, very spicy! it consisted of chunks of white meat stir-fried with onions, mushrooms, and lots of ginger
they had some novel drinks on the menu i recommend the fresh-squeezed lemongrass juice (very refreshing, similar to a gingery lemonade)
the waiters were nice, but not quite attentive enough to fill our water glasses when we needed them to
theres a lot of variety on the menu, so i will probably come again to try some other stuff
Igo here frequently because it is so good, so good that we take people here who have lived in Thailand and they also say they love it
don't let the cute decor fool you -- this is the worst thai food i've ever eaten (and i eat thai food at least once a week)
i got pra-ramayana to go, and when i got it to my office, found that they had given me a container full of steamed vegetables which seemed to be chopped with andre the giant in mind
the peanut sauce came in a tiny plastic cup smaller than a shot glass
what was i supposed to do with that? the sauce lasted for about three bites of broccoli
i tried the second sauce that they gave me, but it appeared to be watered-down molasses garnished with sesame seeds
totally inedible
now the leftover veggies are smelling up my desk and it's totally gross
The reason why this place stands out in my book is because they do thai a little different than any other thai place in the city that I know of (granted I don't know them all!!!)
The food is always very fresh, good portions, nice flare overall
The ambience is just fine, the cocktail list is good, and I have had nothing but positive experiences when I've gone there
If there was one area I feel they could improve upon it would be the service
It's not terrible by any means, but it's also not that great either
On a Sat night when it picks up, be prepared to wait for your server to come around
Still, I continue to eat at Regional Thai because the food is unique
This is a local I've wanted to try for a while but was dissapointed with my first visit
The food is standard Thai fare with no high notes
Service is somewhat slower than expected for a small restaurant
The interior is confortable, but nothing exciting enough to drum up the experience
Cost is reasonable (about $35) for appetizer, two meals and a drink but I will not be back
Had dinner there and sat outdooors
Drank the mango drink, which was absolutely delicious and perfect for a warm night
The appetizers and entrees are pretty decent, but is definitely Americanized
The staff might be Latin American, but then this is New York City
While there are a number of other more authentic Thai places, the atmosphere works well with any size group and I would definitely go there again
Having travelled to Thailand several times and trying almost every Thai resraurant in New York City, this place ranks last for everything it offers
Americanised food, guest eating with sticks (Thai only use them for noodles) , spanish staff, non authentic restaurant design
how much worse can it get
Never again
This place is one of the very few Thai open during lunch, so I'm not left with much choice
Somehow the food is missing that sizzle of Thai food - the Tom Yum Po Tak was so bland and blah, I needed to add the chili sauce myself
The overall menu seems a little weak here, but as the cleanest option I have for lunch, I've gotten somehow used to it

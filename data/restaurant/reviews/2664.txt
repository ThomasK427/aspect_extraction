THE PIZZA IS AWESOME AND THE HOT WINGS ARE DELICOUS! ON THE MONEY ! THIS OUT OF TOWNER TAKES TRIPS FROM OUT OF STATE JUST FOR ONE OF THEIR SLICES ! DENINOS # 1 HANDS DOWN !
try denino's you'll be glad you did, in addition to the cold beer and outstanding pizza, you have to try thier fried calamari, best around, stop at world famous Ralph's Italian Ices across the street for dessert, go with the lemon!
The Brick oven pizza is the best I've ever had
The simple setting is very family friendly
It's almost always crowded so get there early but the pizza is well worth the wait
That's their motto and their claim to fame
The absolutely BEST pizza crust in New York City and possibly the world
Our babies teethed on that crust and so have loved Denno's almost since birth
It's barroom pizza, no yuppie goat cheese and watercress concoctions - just a premium crust topped with the standard favorites
Will DeNino's be voted NUMBER ONE? No
Staten Island's population is dwarfed by the other boroughs
We don't have enough voters to win
But in a taste-test competition, Denino'w would win hands down
I traveled 1000 miles to visit relatives on Staten Island AND stop by for a Denino's Pizza
it was worth it, very, very good pizza!
This pizzeria/bar is extremely over rated
Pizza is usually burned and laden with cheese oil
In my opinion, current Staten Island Food critics need to get off the island a little more
Simply the best pizza in and around Staten Island! IF you can get a parking space and IF you can get a table in a timely manner, you're fortunate
If not, it will be well worth the wait!
I have had Pizza everywhere and there has only been one place that can top Denino's and that's in New Haven Ct
and I forgot the name
So, that leaves Denino's
To finish off things right, go across the street and get yourself a Ralph's Homemade Italian Ice, another best In Good old Staten Island!
i have to say deninos pizza is great
i grew up eating there
the pizza is great the service is great and its always a pleasure to go there
my personal favorite is the grabage pie, garlic bread, fried calamari and a nice big picture of beer
YUMMY!!
Best pizza, best atmosphere, you just feel like family when you're at Deninos
But that's not the only reason we go at least once a week
The pizza's THAT GOOD
Denino's is a special place and the pizza is GREAT! Try the special
Simply one of the best pizza parlors around
Also, it is across the street from the famous Ralph's Ice, so after you are done with your dinner, you can get some great ices for dessert
The secret is the malt used to make the dough extra crispy
shhhhhh
add the best quality igredients you can find anywhere, an ice cold beer and a very friendly working class crowd and BAMMMMM
your in pizza heaven baby
When returning to quot;The Islandquot; my first stop from the airport is Denino's
Like Pavlov's dog my mouth is watering as my visit time gets closer
The ambiance, the aroma, the customers make Denino's thee pizza place of New York
I grew up going here and it was always a treat to go to Denino's
Their garbage and MRO (meatball, ricotta onion) pies are just yummy
Nothing too fancy around here, just a good NY slice with a splash of sterotypical Staten Island
(The couple in matching sweatsuits just add to the charm
) You can even get a glass of domestic draft for 75 cents, although the glass is on the small side
Fried calamari and buffalo wings will round out your calorie fest
And, don't forget to go across the street for dessert and the best Italian ices at Ralph's
I have always heard rave reviews of Denino's Pizzeria and I finally got around to checking it out for myself
I must say it definitely lived up to all expectations!! Nice thin crust, not too much sauce, and just the right amoung of cheese makes for a great pie!
Deninos serves excellent inexpensive thin crust pizza that is served hot and quick
The atmosphere is great for a couple and even for parties of 20+
I highly reccomend going to Deninos
Although the menu (anything other then pizza) is small, everything on it is EXCELLENT
If you are lucky enough to attend Deninos in the summer make sure you leave room for dessert, Ralph's Famous Italian Ices is right across the street!!
Had worked up an hearty appettie after catching XXX at the UA FOREST STADIUM and the kitchen was about to close at 10:30 on a Sunday nite
Despite that they seated us and took our order for a large pie with onions
What can I say
the crust was perfectly crispy and the sauce was delicious
They didn't scimp on the onions !!! Perfectly cooked with that soft texture and sweetness
The atmosphere isn't ornate but hey
the pizza is really great
They are adding more seating and have a private room in the back for parties
The bar area welcomes the locals
Denino's is definitely worth a trip to Staten Island
Make a day of it
Go to the beach on the south shore and then hit Denino's for a quick bite before or after the movies
I grew up a few miles from Deninos
I have had Pizza fron all around the country and all around the world
Nothing compares to Deninos
I go there as often as I can
Now that I live in NJ I still name Denino's as the best pizza on the planet
Still make the trip and still sing its praises
A meatball pie, a sausage pie, a pitcher of McSorley's and some friends - can life be any better? I submit that it CAN NOT!!
A Denino's Pizza, my husband and a pitcher of beer
Life can't get much sweeter than that :o)
The best kept secret in New York - rivals Lombardi's and Grimaldi's
STop by Ralph's for a great 1-2 combo
It's always a pleasure to dine at Bella Mama
The waiters are friendly and attentive; the servings are generous and prepared to perfection
The garlic knots that are offered with your meal are a signature item
Try the Veal or Chicken a la Bella Mama
the marriage of the ingredients will make your mouth water
If this is the place I last had pizza in Staten Islan, it is great
I have been there 3 times and have never been disappointed
The pizza is loaded with toppings and the crust is nice and thin
Price is well deserved for the quality of the food that you are served
Other reviewers complained of price, you get what you paid for!!!! Why go to Manhattan to sit in traffic and pay for parking when you can have a exquisite meal close to home
The best food on Staten Island with consistent new experiences for the palate
Great restaurant, but if price is a consideration - Stay away
Food is of NYC quality, as are the prices
Service average at best, the local regulars seem to dominate the staff
Other places are worth considerations
This is one of my favorite places to dine on SI (along with Aesop's Tables and Trattoria Romana) and the reason is simply good food
Carol prepares excellent, diverse dishes and the overall experience is always pleasant
The best bargain, however, is the 4 course prix fixe offered on Wednesday and Thursday night
There is no better bargain considering the quality of food received
You can spend $20 to eat at Applebees so this is truly a catch
The prices on regular nights are a bit high for SI but the food still merits the prices

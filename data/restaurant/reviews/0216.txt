Try the dates wrapped in bacon
yum
This has officially beat out La Paella (a neighboring Tapas restaurant) for the best sangria although it didn't do as well on the food
But although Paella is a better value (cheaper, better food), Sala's tapas were still very good
There's a little cute lounge downstairs and a long bar on entrance so its a good place to go to eat and to chill
And oh yeh, order the soup
its delicious
SALA has great food, a great vibe, and the DJ in the lounge (Daniel) has great taste in music
He sets the right mood everytime
Sala has a great feel to it
--Rustic yet warm
The sangria tasted very good even after I had had one two many
However,I was disappointed with the tapas selection--everything was very traditional which meant there was not much variety or creativity in the menu
The dishes were also a little heavy
Service was unremarkable
Prices are reasonable
Food was very good, although were expecting a little more
Service has a lot to be desired
Music was good, btu a touch loud but I didn't notice it after awhile
Downstairs looked OK, but small
I went to Sala with a few friends for my birthday
It was perfect
I work in the restaurant industry and I am always looking for places to eat that are fun and still appetizing
The food was wonderful
I even went with a friend who lived in Spain for a few years
He agreed the food was authentic
Our server was nice and prompt with our food
We had a great time
I definitely recommend going to Sala especially with a group of friends!
I recently went to Sala with friends for dinner and had the best time
The owner was sooooo accomidating there was a private party downstairs and let us know when it was over so we could dance downstairs
The Pallella was the best I had outside of Valencia, Spain
The make it the traditional way--dry with seafood--lots of saffron
Don't share the same excitement about the place as Monica, Robert, etc
do
Okay, but not as special as they claim
We thought we were back in Spain
The food was fantastic, and the flan was the best we'd ever tried
Our wait person, Monica was great not to mention beautiful
What a find!!!
VERY VERY reasonablly priced
Robert, the maitre'd was wonderful
Sangria was completely kick-ass and the shrimp in garlic was wonderful as was the white asparagus
THe atmosphere was cool, but the bartender could have smiled more
I would give it a whirl if you don't mind weird dishes
You definately get your money's worth, but it wasn't the best dinner i have ever had
We went for a friend's birthday, it was fun with a group of people
The sangria and the tapas were delicious, but the paella was a little bland- stick to the tapas!!!
I went there with a group of friends for my birthday last week
service was terrible, waiter was trying to take our menus before even ordering, not to mention his attitude
when the meal, which was nothing to rave about, was over and some people got up to go to the bathroom, he kicked us out
wouldn't go back if it was the last restaurant left in the city!!!
Went on a weeknight for drinks and appetizers
The sangria was really good (and did its job; the selection of tapas was somewhat limited but I tried them all --and they were great! Not only was the food tasty but the portions were large for tapas
Also, the ambience is quaint and aptly reminiscent of a restaurant in Spain
Drank a few pitchers of sangria at the bar and couldn't resist the tapas that went by
The food was tasty and the atmosphere was great!
Said to be a place good for groups- I mildly agree
It is relatively small and quaint; the decor is nice, but the lighting a little too dim, unless its for a romantic affect (we could hardly see the menus in the candlelight)
The service was attentive, and prompt
The food was fair; portions are moderate
Definately try the date covered in bacon appetizer and honey-glazed duck entree
The rest of the appetizers were good; steaks were too well-cooked; paella was decent
(in reference to the crunchy rice entry, the rice is only crunchy on the bottom, due to the way it is cooked, not because the rice was undercooked
) The sangria is robust in flavor, a definate plus
Overall
I would not necessarily recommend this place to everyone I know, but it is worth trying, just so that you can form your own opinions
The food at Sala is amazing and authentic
The last reviewer obviously hasn't been to Spain where, yes, rice is left a little undercooked
It's a regional way to cook rice, not a kitchen accident
I highly recommend the paella, the date and bacon appetizer, and the sangria! But you'll find that everything is delicious although the restaurant can get a little noisy at times
The Scene It's big, brawny, bibulous, and has a swagger that befits the popular coast-to-coast steakhouse chain
The wood-paneled bar, scrawled with caricatures of well-known habitues past and present, is aswarm at cocktail hour with both theatergoers and corporate tipplers hunkered down for the night
It can get frenzied in the dining room, although high-backed wooden booths deflect some of the roar
The Food Palm dry ages its steaks--as opposed to vacuum packing--and the result is evident
The ribeye is intensely flavored and thoroughly succulent, as is the well-charred New York strip and the monstrous porterhouse
Double-cut lamb chops are first-rate as well
Seafood, for those who are grudgingly along for the carnivorous joy ride, is fine, especially the moist and mustardy crab cakes
Starters are predictable--you could go with the better-than-average Caesar salad, fried calamari or the excellent oysters
Among the confectionery barbells offered, chocolate pecan pie is the way to go
Was there a few weeks ago with a party of six
Was very packed - probably a popular pre-theater spot
The steaks just weren't that great, especially not for the price
All of our steaks were undercooked based on
Went here with 3 friends to celebrate and had a great meal
We got drinks in the waiting area first and got heavy pours for both bourbon and martinis
At dinner I had the 16 oz
filet which, if you're hungry, is well worth the extra $3 to bump up from the 10 oz
It was brown and textured on the outside and deep purple on the inside, excellent
Spinach was a little thin but tasted incredible
Mashed potatoes were very good too
The calamari appetizer was enormous and almost went unfinished by our 4-person group
Definitely recommend for a splurge
I could write a long-winded speech about how bad the Palm is but it's not worth the keystrokes
Cream Spinach:  Disgusting
All this dish was missing was a shot of rum
The cream spinach was saturated with cinnamon
It taste like eggnog with spinach bits
Mushrooms:  Similar to the Spinach
Lots of cinnamon Horrible

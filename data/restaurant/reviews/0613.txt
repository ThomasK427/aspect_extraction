Why do that? Otto really needs to get over itself
Every time I go to Otto I can't help but feel like I want to move into their kitchen
Everything about it makes me smile - from the European train station schedule board that announces the next table to the lovely wine connoisseurs waiting to help you out (Peter's my favorite) to the exquisite food - the eggplant caponatina, the condiments that accompany the cheese plate, the funghi e taleggio pizza, the olive oil gelato (order it, you won't be sorry and you won't be able to eat Tasti D-Lite ever again) - it's all just fabulous
I'm going there tonight, a week after my last visit - it's been too long!!!
Olive Oil Gelato, sounds strange but is truly awakening
The are other more traditional flavors that are excellent as well
The pizza is crisp and flavored concisely
Everytime I go there, I leave happy
Usually the simpler the dish, the better it is
The waitstaff was helpful and friendly, taking back a drink that my date did not enjoy without a whisper of annoyance
I had a wonderful meal at Otto
We started with caprese which was one of the best I've tried
and then had the quattro formaggio pizza which was one of the best I've had in the city (probably ties with La Lantera's margherita pizza)
The wine was great, service great and the gelato was delicious
It's a little pricey, but well worth it
Spent time in northern Italy and fell in love with that style of Pizza (thin crust and fresh cheeses)
Here in NY, Otto has the best pizza I've had since then
The wines are great and the desserts/coffee are very good as well
The service is typically off (wine served after pizza arrives, wrong orders, forgetful waiters), but they are usually gracious and try to make up for it
Go early in the week to avoid the crowds, or order some fantastic wine and wait by the bar
It's well worth it
This place is simply put a terrific bargain
Take the advice of the other reviewers and make a meal out of the high quality, savory antipasti that is offered
(I agree that the pizza is amazing when fresh from the oven but isn't much to write home about once cooled)
The wine list is impressive with wines from every region in Italy and the sommeliers are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly
The gelati is a MUST
The ambience is wonderful and seating is roomy and relaxed
Is definitely money well spent
You'd think this place would be a pretentious who's-who thanks to ownership by carrot top Batali, but it's surprisingly approachable
It's great for celebrations, the reservation staff is friendly, and the table service is always knowledgeable and courteous
Servings are ample, and the wine list is most thorough, although I recommend making a meal of the appetizers and delicious antipasti - although the pizza is good, you have to scarf it since it's lackluster when not fresh from the oven
Try the hazelnut gelato - it's mindblowing
the cheese dish was probably the best part of the meal
though the portions were smaller than average, the flavor and sauces that accompany them (truffle honey, cherries and peaches in mustard sauce) were all really good
the pizza was nothing special or spectacular, though nothing to really complain about either
the gelato was very good and, unlike the cheese, the portions were huge! spent about $30 total (shared the cheese appetizer)
I must say any restaurant I have been to where Mario is part owner, is wonderful! Our server, Fernando, was excellent at describing the wines to perfection
I also like the fact that you can order superb wines by the glass without having to buy a bottle
The cheese was paired off with black cherries, apricot preserves, and honey
What an innovative creation! The pizza was fabulous as well
It is definately worth the trip here as any other Mario restaurant!
the restaurant's vibe is vibrant and group dining friendly
the best part of my meal would be the antipasti: the eggplant was divine and gobbled up quickly
as for the pizza
i advise to fill up on the antipasti, because the pizza is not too tasty
the service here is very slow
expect to wait 15 minutes for your check, and do not expect a thank you
Never have I been treated so badly at a restaurant in NYC or any place on earth
To begin, the menu not only TRIES to be pretentious and obnoxious but succeeds when complimented with the rudeness of the waiter
We asked him if one of the specialty drinks contained an ingredient that one of us is highly allergic to, he stared at us and after the third time explaining to him the matter, he agreed to check
Never did he check to see if we enjoyed our meal or thank us for coming
Instead, they tossed the check down after having to wait extensively
To say I would never go back does not begin to describe the conditions of which I would return to this trying to be chic, TOO loud, wanna-be restaurant
If I were Mario, Id check in on my staff
This place was fun and the wine list was extensive
However, the waitress never asked us how our food was, we had to ask for our wine to be chilled as it was warm, and 3 out of the 4 apps we ordered were terrible
Do not order the brocolli rabe or calamri
They were both bitter and bland
I asked for mushrooms on my pizza and they charged $6
The pizza was absolutely mediocre and small for the price
I would NEVER go back!
Loved my experience there! It was my second time and was even better than the 1st
Didn't have to wait long and the service was perfect
Food was so tasty and excellent
The only mistake was ordering the 4 cheese pizza as it had a very stong cheese that smelled terrible
The best part of the meal was the mouth watering homemade gelato
It was the best I've had in the city! It's made from fresh ingredients and you can taste it!!!
Go here on a quiet Sunday afternoon, like I did, and get treated quite well
Even got a glimpse of Mario himself teaching some kids how to slice cheese
But that was the highlight, and that is why this place will do well, the name of Batali backing it
The whole menu is a little confusing
It's really just a lot of antipasto and pizza
Try the figs in balsamic vinegarette cauliflower and be sure to stick around for the desserts
The place is very warm and welcoming
The service is attentive, yet our waiter was like a robot, I got the impression that servers are not allowed to speak to the customers at all, and answers about dishes were explained in a text-book sort of way
Overall nothing to rave about
Expect to spend a lot and to leave hungry
Gotta love the flights the apps, the never-ending wine list easily deciphered by the super friendly insightful waitstaff
however, the pizzas are merely above average (but are an excellent value at their reasonable prices), and though the desserts are better than I expected they're hardly out of this world
the noise level is deafening, but this is a populist joint, so what do you expect? if they didn't pack 'em in, you'd be paying twice as much
Decided to go in on a lark, over Labor Day weekend
The space wasn't too crowded so there was none of the noise factor I've heard about
Seated promptly and warmly
Service was quite good, as our waiter was knowledgeable about the ingredients we were unfamiliar with
The bruschetta was some of the best I've eaten
One may not think eggplant, mint and chiles are meant to be combined
But they are
And the two pizzas we ordered were fantastic
And dessert was delivered with some of the best gelati I've possibly eaten in the city
As creamy and tasty as could be
Particularly by an olive oil gelato
Prices do add up, though
But well worth it
What a fun, elegant way to do pizza
Casual food for a food lovers
Fun pizzas, great slice proscuitto and other charcuterie
We had a wonderful bottle of wine
Fabulous ambiance the red rustic walls and wood tables are great
But wow, they need to rethink their wait staff
Our waitress bordered on evil!!!!! She forgot our water, our drinks, and mis- ordered some of our food

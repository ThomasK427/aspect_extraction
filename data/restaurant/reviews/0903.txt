This was after waiting for her slow a-s to get to our table
They might need more help, but also anouther time I went there at an off-hour and I was seated at one of the only tables there, and my food, which I ordered after my drinks, arrived before the afore-mentioned drinks
I could go on and on
Was convinced to go there for a 3rd time because of the great big outdoor area and huge screen for a game
I will never go back
The service is unfriendly and totally incompetent
We were served unopened bottles of beer and had to wait for 10 minutes with our unopened beers in front of us
They wouldn't change one of the TVs that nobody was watching (seemingly to show their importance as being in control of the bar)
Other simple requests were ignored
The staff acts like they are doing you a favor to be there
And they are easily the slowest human beings on the planet
The food isn't even that good
There is no reason to go here
This place has so much potential - Especially considering the outside deck/tent which has some nice tables and a big-screen TV for sporting events
Seems like the perfect venue to watch a game on a nice night
However, and please take this literally
this place has the worst service that I have ever witnessed
I am generally not a harsh critic, but I have been to this place three times in the past year, and each time all of the people in my party were astonished at how terrible/angry/rude the service was
The first time I entered this bar, I remember thinking Wow, what a great sports bar - Im gonna come here all the time
After three awful experiences - I will never go again
When Croxley Ales opened up more than a year ago, I said, A sports bar? That is so not the East Village
Turns out I was wrong
It is very much a symptom of what the East Village has become--a neighborhood of meatheads and jocks who feel that the neighborhood is their own personal playground
If wide-screen TVs and hot wings are your fare, then put on your college sweatshirt, flip your baseball cap to rally mode and pump your fist in the air, because everyone at Croxley Ales knows your name, Chip
I can't wait for the Hooters to open up where Charas used to be
I like this place and so does my wife
Good drinks and beers with affordable menu offering
Garden is fantastic
service was plesant and mannered
They were a little slow due to the crowds on the weekend
I went to Croxley's for the Jets game last week
It was a little crowded but the food was great and so was the beer
I had Croxley's blond and it was very good
I am usually a bud light drinker but this bar didn't have any, so the bartender reccomended Croxley's blond and I wasn't dissapointed
The atmosphere was that of an old English pub
I would highly reccomend it and I will probably be there for the Super Bowl
I've been to this bar a total of four times and after the last you couldn't pay me to go back
The hostess is extremely rude, the service staff all looks like they would rather die than be working there, not a smile in the place! And so, so, so slow! Not that I know anywhere else where you can find 10 cent wings twice a week that actually taste good, but between that obnoxious hostess and the miserable bartenders and servers, you're guaranteed a pretty awful atmostphere
The title says it all
This bar is about the beer you won't find at every other bar
Great and interesting beers on draught -- 30 in total
There's also a great outdoor space
It's definitely worth the trip to the East Village for an atypical bar experience!
if you like wings and burgers, this is your new home! i've never had such a tasty, and juicy burger like that before! and the cajun fries! oh my god! my friend ordered some wings by the piece, the best ever
and the best thing about it all, is that it was cheap! the wings are
10c a piece!!!! we are hooked
i celebrated my birthday there last week
it was the best ever!
let me tell you that's probably the best place to throw a party at
they have that huge tent in the back where they were showing the best music videos on a 'movie theatre size screen'
the drinks were cheap
just pure fun!
i'm defenetly going back there!
went there last saturday to catch a game, man! this place kicks a--! there 's TVs all over the place, they have like a million beers on tap, there's also a super heated garden with the biggest screen ever
it's like a dream come true for a sports fan
this area really neede a spot like that
my new hang-out
The garden in back is fantastic for a date or small group get together
If you're looking for a place with a great outdoor ambience, Croxley's is it
Croxley Ales on Ave
B is a great surprise in a neighbor filled with punk bars and restaurants
I found Croxley's while roaming the streets with some friends
We had a great table in their backyard garden
which has a SMOKING section!! The food was good and I tasted beers that I never knew existed before
If you want a place to enjoy some else's company and drink great beer in a casual setting
Choose Croxley's!!
The Scene Two soaring stories, draped in red-velvet curtains with dramatic opera boxes overlooking the dining room, couldn't be more indulgent: Bordello lamps hang above plush, upholstered round booths, and suited mixologists man the showpiece wood bar
Service is extraordinary: Between all the hosts, maitre d's, wait captains and servers, diners are pampered until the last bite
The Food The standard steakhouse menu arrives in the form of a monologue, but it's also written on the blackboard above the bar
Crab cakes, crispy-crusted baked clams, and gorgeously dressed, crispy Caesars draped with fresh-cured anchovies are good starts
The prime dry-aged steaks are some of the city's priciest, but they're worth the splurge: T-bones and Flintstone-sized rib eyes arrive with a crispy broiled crust, which accounts for their impressive juiciness
Desserts include a gooey chocolate souffle, super-sweet creme brulee and a decadent Mississippi mud cake
Had a wonderful Friday night dinner here with a group of five
After a short wait at the bar (which was very crowded), we were seated upstairs at a private table
The waiter was friendly, funny, and helpful
The steaks were perfectly done, and the side dishes were wonderful
It was fairly pricey, but well worth it for a nice night out
I will definitely return!
PLACE IS SO GOOD THEY OFFER KOBE STEAK! EXCELLENT PLACE FOR A BUSINESS DINNER
QUALITY STEAKS! GREAT SERVICE! A MUST FOR STEAK LOVERS!
Good to Great steak, not quite Peter L-worthy, but good nonetheless
The Kobe is ok, there is better to be had in the city (Kobe should NEVER be broiled)
Service is admirable, but the noise in the house overpowers it
The look is nice, but again the noise overpowers it
Flatscreens at the bar make sense, but in the dining room? This screams MSG/LIRR crowd and is not something you need/want in an upscale NYC steakhouse
I guess you can take the Uncle Jack's out of Bayside, but you can't take the Bayside out of Uncle Jack's
For the price you pay whether personally or professionally, I just thought UJ's dropped the ball
Having recently moved into the garment district I was looking foward to finding a cool steakhouse to become a regular at
I thought Uncle Jacks might be the place
The ambience was old school cool, but that was the best thing
My girlfriend and I had the Porterhouse advertised at 48 oz, one it was not 48oz two I don't think it was all porterhouse
The sommeiler acted liked a used car sales person trying to make us buy super marked up wine
Overall a very unpleasent experience
We will not be back
Uncle Jack has good reputation so we decided to give it a try for a business dinner
I have made better decisions
Service was pushy, pretentious, clueless, overbearing and our waiter definitely had an attitude
The seafood appetizers were average and the steak were average-to-good
The Kobe steak on the other hand was MUCH better and I'd recommend getting that over any other steak they serve
The atmosphere is ok but I've seen better

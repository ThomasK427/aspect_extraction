Service was great and our waitress was fantastic
My friend had a chicken dish she raved about with spinach and olives
Very busy, make a reservation
Our dinner last night was good
I've heard much about htis place and was not disappointed
My companion had the fresh tuna which was cooked perfectly rare, and I had the Veal Osso Bucco which was falling off the bone delicious
A dessert sampler had a mousse to die for and some of the creamiest ice creams I have ever tasted
Try the Cherry Vanilla!
We had a large party of 10
I was not disappointed in the the veal chop I had, it was very good, but we could not get a dish of pasta for the kids at all
We paid full price and they ate nothing
The dishes were a bit unusual and very overpriced
The wine list was completely in Italian and the waiter seemed agitated with us
The best deal was the wine at $20/bottle
The food was okay, not worth $375

I'll go to Johns Pizza next time
We felt we were ripped off!
My husband and I recently visited New York and ate at Becco before we saw a show
We had reservations and were seated immediately
The all you can eat pasta was wonderful and the flavors were amazing
The wine list is extensive and very reasonable ($20 a bottle)
The service was superb and the dining room was filled with laughter and conversation of people enjoying a night out with friends and loved ones
We had a great time and would return
Each time i want good food, i always go to becco
I constantly recommend this place to my friends who are seeing a show, a place to get together for a birthday or meeting friends for dinner
The price is reasonable, the service is wonderful, the people are really nice and the presentation is outstanding
Even though they have a wonderful menu selction i always order the pasta pre-fixed and how can you go wrong with the wine list for 20

do not pass up on tryin becco
you would be missing out!
I'm still full! 14 of us went last night to Becco
We did a four course extravaganza they call abbondanza
Awesome rib eye steak, chicken with olives and fettucvini bolognese were among some of the best things I've ever tasted
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Ate at Becco last night
All I can say is WOW! Appetizer of soft polenta and crispy mushrooms was unlike anything I've ever had
Delisch! And the pasta course with Ossobuco was fabulous
Busy place, lots of fun and great service
if you want that! Someone comes by with a saucepan of different pastas, all at once, thrown on your plate most unappealingly
Like an all you can eat buffet at some cheap restaurant
And the salad was old, plain, and terrible
The 'good price' did not include anything but the slop they called pasta
The price was overpriced, way over priced
Go anywhere, but don't go here
I hear esca is good
The morracan place across the street served excellent fish
Great price too
DOn't remember the name
My wife and I both had the daily pastas for dinner
The waitstaff is courteous and the food is terrific
With so many $20 bottles of wines from which to choose, our waiter helped pick a good one
We'll be back
I had the delicious $21
95 all u can eat pasta special
It was great
No soggy pasta here
The bread and olives were great also
Wonderful wait staff !!
Very simple review:  Food was great! Their pollo al limone was fantastic
The atmosphere was amazing
My girlfriend and I had lunch on a Sunday afternoon to celebrate our anniversary
It was quite a romantic setting
The room did get a bit noisy as the meal went on
It seems they've attempted to make use of every ounce of space in the dinning area
This led to a small logistical problem and a slight feeling of crampness
Came here again for pre-theatre dinner
This time got the prix fixe pasta with antipasti starter
The antipasti consisted of excellent roasted vegetables, fresh peas, baby octopus, buffalo ricotta with honey, macerated salmon - all incredible and fresh
All-you-can-eat pastas of the day (served table side hot from the pan!!) were house-made linguine primavera, penne with tomato sauce and fresh basil, and oxtail ravioli (unbelievable)
I had so much I thought I couldn't take anymore
Then I room for dessert! We shared ricotta cheesecake with sour cherries and amaretto semifreddo, paired with vin santo
With a bottle of rosso piceno, the tab came to $180 (tax/tip included) for 4 people
And our waiter was absolutely delightful and very knowledgeable on the food and wine
For $ 21
95 you get mixed antipasto or Caesar salad ( go with the antipasti ) and unlimited servings of three homemade pastas
Good food at a great price!
$21
95 PRE-FIXE WITH CHOICE OF A GREAT CAESAR SALAD OR A WONDERFUL MIXED ANTIPASTO, THEN THEY SERVE THREE HOUSE-MADE PASTAS FROM A HOT KITCHEN SAUTE PAN
THE MUSHROOM AND SWISS CHARD RAVIOLI WERE SUBIME! HUGE LIST OF GOOD WINES, EACH PRICED AT $20
NOT ONLY A GREAT VALUE, BUT EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PLEASANT DECOR
I had a friend in from Texas and we met there at 9pm
Even though our reservations weren't until 9:30pm, they took us right away
We had a table upstairs and I loved the room
The service was incredible
Leave a lot of time to eat though, because they let you EXPERIENCE the meal, you are not rushed through it
We did not leave there until 12:20am
The portions are huge, and I would recommend adding the all-you-can-eat 3 pastas to any meal
It was worth it
And definitely get the dessert sampler
For only $4
50 pp, you get about 3 desserts each
Great for sharing
All wines were $20 and we really enjoyed ours
Overall, a wonderful dining experience
Bravo!
The food is good - especially all the small plates
amazing falafel and tabouleh (?) salad
The place is small
quaintly decorated

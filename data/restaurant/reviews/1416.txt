the execution
embarrasing
First, there was almost no sauce
it was completely watered down
I'm not looking for ragu
but
there is a happy middle ground no? 2nd, the short beef rib
uhm,
i thought there was supposed to be meat on that? Now, lets talk about risotto
its essentialy rice, slowly cooked
thickened, with other flavorful stuff, right? Well, my friends risotto
was totally watered down
He said it seemed to be intended that way
If that is true
then, fire the chef
I love this place
The food is amazing and the service is great
It is a beautiful space with a relaxed atmosphere
I see the gnochi with short ribs has already been reviewed and what an understatement! The pasta itself is perfectly sized and tender, and the short ribs were so tender I thought I was eating filet mignon
I was also fortunate enough to have dinned with 5 other people, and sampled the shrimp scampi, grilled salmon, scallops, steak, and sunday gravy, all amazing! I happened to be eating with my fiance and both sets of our parents
We had such a good time, I inquired about the possibility of a private party
Sure enough, they had space for 60 or so in the Waterfall room
To date, both of our families continue to rave about the feast prepared for us by Chef Tony Acinapura, truly amazing!   Aquaterra is not only the perfect atmosphere for a romantic dinner, but is also a great place for a celebration! (even with young kids)
Aquaterra's cozy and inviting bar got me in the door, the great selection of Italian wines and grappa kept me there, but the cuisine is what will keep me coming back
A week later I returned with a date
We were seated at a quite romantic table in the back room flanked by a fireplace and a glass wall showcasing a tranquil waterfall
I ordered the grilled rib steak with gorgonzola potato gratin, which was tremendous, both in portion and flavor
We finished the meal with prosecco, vanilla roasted pears over citrus butter cake, and vanilla gelato
As an added bonus, parking next door is only $10 for up to four hours with validation
This is quickly becoming my favorite new spot
I eat at this place the first week they opened and have been going back for more
Everything I've tried has been fabulous the Gnoqui with Short Rib Ragu was awesome, and the Aquaterra Salad is perfect and delicious
Finally for chocolate lovers like me, I suggest you try the trio of chocolates, which consist of a Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake, Profiteroles, and Chocolate Crme Brule
Since their opening three weeks ago I have eaten at Aquaterra several times and have never been disappointed!! The food is fabulous!!! It reminds me of My grandmother's home cooked Italian dinners on Sunday! The setting is warm and inviting and you feel like you are surrounded by friends the minute you walk in the door
The fountain room is equally perfect for a romantic dinner or a family or office party
Chef Tony's creations are delicious and he makes a point to remember his regular customers and welcome them personally
Overall Aquaterra is a great dining experience!!! ANd if you are just in the mood for drinks-the bar is great fun too!!!
I had dinner several days ago and was completely blown away
The gnocchi with braised meat was perfect, while the snapper entree was a stroke of genius
He used potato to recreate the scales of a fish, then lightly sauteed it until golden and flaky
The service was observant but not intrusive and everyone was knowledgeable enough to answer questions about ingredients and preparations
The wine selection was good and the ambiance was very romantic
Good end to a long day of work and I will definitely return with my wife
I was fortunate to meet the chef of this restaurant, Tony Acinapura
He recommended that I try the paparadelle with walnut pesto (since I don't eat meat)
It was unique and extremely delicious
This restaurant is a pleasant surprise, since I usually dine downtown
There are 2 separate rooms, both very comfortable and a nice bar with displays of fine Italian wine
Its the perfect spot for a big group, business lunch or romantic date
My friend got very ill from their food
There are many other Thai places to choose from
Avoid if possible
Beet is great
Mango and Avocado salad is tasteful
I love live Jazz music especially Beat at Beet every other Saturday
Nice ambience
They offer the good food under $17
00
(Cheap food but good quality)
Freindly service
Their special menu made Beet dominat from the other Thai restaurants in Slope
Tiny space, too RED for the size
The guy in the corner is screaming loudly in a ear to the sound of guitar
Food is not tasty at all
Famous in reviews Mango/Avocado salad is just pieces of mango with one small piece of avocado on the top
Pad Thai was too moist for my taste (sleezy) Fish was overfried
Nothing exciting overall
Beet Thai is the best place to be
I've heard about this restaurant from a friend of mine; with good food along the best service
Therefore, I went there last weekend with a group of friends
I could tell they have the best thai food in Park Slope, espeacially the lobster dish I had was so tasty and YUMMY! They have good prices though
Besides they provide good customers' satisfaction
There are DJ's and Live Music during weekends
I sure will visit again
We had the pad thai which was a little slimey
The vegetable dumplings were good, but the spicy chicken was kind of bland
The service was very good, however
Beet Thai is a restaurant that has fabulous thai food
I went there on New Year's Eve with my friends; we had lots of fun
We enjoyed our dinner very much
I had an appetizer called Coconut Shrimp
It was delicious and tasty
One of my friends had something called Filet Red Snapper w/ Champagne-Vanilla Butter Sauce, and it was so YUMMY! They also have great cocktail drinks
The place is very delightful
I'll definitely go back there again
Hey, this place is near my house
We order from here frequently - and they are always very accomodating for vegans
YUM!
Never know this restaurant before, then I just got the mailed menu for delivery
It looked pretty interesting
I ordered soft-shell crab with royal spice sauce, wow crabs size is so big
I couldn't believe they use this size for low price, the flavor is also great
Their delivery time was just 20 minutes
I have tried several thai restuarants in park slope, and I found that BEET THAI restaurant is the BEST
Their tasty food makes me hungry at all time
=P They have great services and friendly wait staff
I love the decor; it brings its' brightness to the customers
BEET THAI is definitely a ROMANTIC restuarant to dine in w/ friends and family
FAIR PRICES!!!  ENJOY YOUR DELICIOUS MEAL @ BEET THAI!!!
I have been there many times

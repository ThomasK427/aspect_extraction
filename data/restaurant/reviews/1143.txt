As a NYC resident for 23 years and one who loves trying new hip restaurants, I was appalled at how I and my business associates were treated at BLT Fish
Since when is a restaurant doing us a favor for honoring a reservation as opposed to customers doing the restaurant a favor by patronizing the establishment
BLT Fish must believe that they will perservere despite how they treat potential customers
BAD SERVICE?
we were literally told to leave the restaurant
We were 20 minutes late for our reservation(we called ahead to alert them) and we lost our reservation
We could not be seated upstairs but they would gladly squeeze 5 into a booth for 4 downstairs, not exactly a pleasant alternative
Don't waste your time or spend your well earned money on a restaurant that obviously thinks they are more important than the customers who attempt to patronize it
We have frequently dined at BLT Steak and love the food, wine list and service
BLT Fish was a HUGE disappointment
We dine out at least 4 nights per week and frequently entertain clients
The seafood was fresh however, the entrees were not all that interesting and the service was less than ok
NOT acceptable for the price! Our food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time
The waitress was unfriendly and not very helpful
The hostess was helping to clear tables
I felt like I should have cleared the table myself and put the plates in the kitchen because she was certainly above working in a restaurant! The seafood was fresh however, overpriced
I was very disappointed, will not go back and will not recommend BLT Fish
BLT should have stuck to Steak
I recently had lunch in the restaurant's casual downstairs space
On the plus side, the food was absolutely amazing, and reasonably priced considering the quality
On the downside, the service was awful
I waited a full 45 minutes for my food, and the two people sitting next to me had their entrees arrive 15 minutes apart
I also took issue with their drink prices
$4 for a Diet Coke? With no refills? At a casual restaurant??? C'mon, guys!
We sat at the raw bar downstairs and ordered several appetizers and drinks on a late Sunday afternoon with a half empty restaurant
Plenty of opportunity for the servers to be attentive or at least polite
They were blatantly, childishly rude
Although they were within a few feet of us to get their attention was a feat and when they attention was turned to us it was rude, sneering and smirking
Quite obnoxious
I will never go back
The food was delicous and the service was very attentive
The best part was the green apple cotton candy served with dessert! An adult twist on this kiddie treat
The downstairs raw bar looked really fun too, I'll be back soon to check it out!
We sat down at 9pm, and waited two hours for our main dishes to be served
The dishes came out essentially one at a time from the kitchen, all cold
When we sent two of the seven dishes back for the chef to just heat up, the chef sent it right back to us and said, he disagreed with our finding, and would not heat them up
To top that though, when we re-sent them back because they were truly cold, the chef sent the waiter back with the dishes and a check asking my party to pay the bill and leave while in the middle of eating
I have never witnessed a more insulting and disgraceful act in a restaurant
This restaurant needs a lot of work, starting with taking a class in Manners 101: how to treat your guests
WHAT A JOKE!!!
Been here twice with my girlfriend since it opened up a few weeks ago
The service is great, friendly staff, cool atmosphere and decorations on the walls
They have great fresh fish, oysters and your traditional new england seafood dishes
I highly recommend the lobster roll, very good and it comes with shoe string fries and side cole slaw
Also, the swordfish with tartar sauce is amazing
Already forward to my next meal there
bakery is full of euro style goodies
pizzeria is clean and their pizza slices taste delicious
gelato caffe and restaurant also on premises
alot of options and very clean
Located inside, but seperate to, B

King Blues CLub, Lucille's has actually been around since the club first opened 4 years ago however it has always been noted simply as a sidekick grill and bar to the main room
even as a sidekick bar though, it's still been able to garner great reviews (the best great bar you'd never think was a great bar- NY Press)
recently the owners have decided to make a completely seperate entity out of it and hire a new chef (jeffrey fishman) and create a new menu (refined southern cuisine)
still in tact is the nightly free live music and the bar's very chill magagony laden trimmings
whether for lunch, a pre- theatre dinner, an after work drink and quick bite or for a formal dinner party- it really is one of the better bargains (food and entertainment in all) in time square
The old owner of the Beach restaurant has created a place of high expectations and lower results in food quality, portion size, menu accuracy and sevice help
very nice food
very interesting wine list
the servers are very friendly and helpful
beautiful ambiance
The first thing you notice about Reve is the unappealing decor when you walk in the door
The restaurant is bland and lacks any sort of style
The service was palatable
The food was average
Three of the entrees weren't available the night we dined
There weren't any specials so the menu was frustratingly limited
Average wine list
Below average evening
the service was horrendous
do not go here!!!!!! the menu looked good and it had potential, but no one waited on us AT ALL!
great new spot! This place was great especially for outdoor seating
The candle lit area gave it a great ambiance
I was especially impressed with the seafood sampler
If you want burgers (except the veggie burger, bad) or brunch on saturday or sunday this is a good place
otherwise, I would check out someplace else
The dinner is not a good value for the quality
But, I could be biased, I hate places that try to be socially conscience at the expense of taste
This is my new favorite place
I have been waiting for a place to get a good burger in my area (North side of Park Slope) for a long time and finally it has arrived
I've tried all the burgers there (Organice Beef, Turkey, Veggie) and loved them all
The portions are huge, the food is great, the service is fast, and the prices are very low
Brunch is even better
And it's both Saturday and Sunday
Now that they're open for dinner with a full wine and beer menu, I'm going to be there even more
Just go there
You'll love it
In Short Chef and owner Gavin Citron dishes up small plates in divided categories of vegetables, meats, fish and cheeses in a setting that mimics his own living room
The space is distinguished by white linen, a walnut bar and plush banquets that match the velvet-finished wall
The artful touches are regards of reknown painter/grandmother, Minna Citron
Menu options include applewood-smoked double lamb chops, Maine lobster with crab risotto, wild mushroom effeillage and reggiano parmesan
This restaurant has great amibience, food, and excellent wine/sake selection
The meals come in nice portions and excellent spices
The chef really puts his passion into every meal making you feel as each dish has been specially made for you
This is an experience to behold
Definitely add this restaurant to your must go to list of great experience
For a rare dining experience you must treat yourself to a meal at this divine establishment in the west village
We happened to stumble upon Citron one weeknight and the dining experience turned an ordinary tuesday evening into a special night
From the service that begin with a wonderful suggestion from the wine list (expansive) to a fig dessert that made me want to stand up and applaud-this meal was one of the best we've had in a long time

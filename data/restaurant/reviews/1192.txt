m on a saturday night, and its inclusion on the 100 Places to Go list in NY Magazine, I was expecting a real gustatory experience
The diver scallop appetizer was interesting (not amazing) but over-priced (2-3 thinly sliced diver scallops for $14?)
The conceptually fresh pork bun sandwich- with a nice quality Berkshire - was too salty, probably due to the salted picked cucumber, salted pork and too-copious amount of hoisin sauce slathered on the bao
And believe me, I am a devout believer in liberally ingesting salt
It featured a nice layering of flavors and texture, but the layering added to the saltiness exponentially
The momofuku ramen (their signature dish) which I expected to be on par with Minca's pork belly version, was a sad imitation, with a bland, soy based soup, with as little of the meat-stock as you would expect for a ramen parading around slices of Berkshire
The slightly poached egg was a nice touch, but could not rescue the dish
The noodles were a tad overcooked, and thusly chewy and spineless
I will be returning to Minca or even Rai-Rai or Menchanko-tei, but never again to Momofuku
this is the first time in my life where i walked out of restaurant with such a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figurtively)
1
the server tells us that it'll be a 15-20 min wait
she told us to stay close
had i known our name would be calle an hour later, i would have gone elsewhere
2
nastiest, SALTIEST, greasiest food EVER!! EVER! we ordered the momofuku ramen and tsukenmen - as soon as we put it in our mouth, we turned to look at eachother with almost spat the ramen back out because the broth was soo salty
had it not been for our hunger due to waiting for an hour! we would have not even continued eating
after our second try at consuming the salty food, we even talked about going next door to get a panini
3
steamed pork buns were so greasy, the buns themselves absorved grease and was excreting it
i probably used 10 napkins to even HOLD my bun
on top of everything else, too much oyster sauce made the buns SALTY again
4
although tap water is fine and that is what we asked for over their bottled water
it is NOT ok to see a server pouring water from the bathroom sink into a water pitcher! that totally grossed us out
THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE
the salty broth made our throats hurt and this morning (the day after) we are sick
WTF!
I love Momofuku
It is one of the smartest restaurant ideas I have seen in the city in a long time
The food is amazing and the service is pretty good for a super casual spot
I always have to have the pork buns
The new zucchini dish is awesome too
can't really understand how this place operates - one chef allows take-out, while the other chef does not
my advice, if you want take-out, go on the days that the really big chef with the tattoos is there
if the other guy is there, don't waste your time or money
he is extremely rude and somehow has given himself the power to decide that take-out is not available when he is behind the counter
I've been here twice--once for lunch and once for dinner and both times have been excellent
While the space is exceptionally small and the seating can be uncomfortable, the food is well worth the few inconveniences
The seasonal pickles and steamed pork buns are to die for
The signature ramen comes in a huge bowl and hit just the right spot
Overall, I suggest to go here if you're not on a tight time schedule (you can't make reservations and both times I went, I ended up waiting about 45 minutes) and looking for something different and low key
My friend and I began with the chicken buns which were excellent but our dining experience took a dive shortly thereafter
The white asparagus appetizer was tasty but overpriced
Next came our main bowls, chicken ramen for my friend and nothing for me as they had given my order to another customer who had ordered 20 minutes after us
The server failed to immediately remedy his error and offered no apologies or even a semblance of chagrin
I also witnessed the same hip mohawk server be equally unaccomodating to another couple who wanted to modify their order placed 30 secs before
His attitude bordered on the rude and snide
As for the final result of our meal, the chicken ramen was violently salty and although the momofuku ramen was better, I have had much better at lower prices
First off I should mention that my review may be slightly negatively tainted due to the fact that they told us the wait would be 30 minutes, but probably less so don't go anywhere
Just under an hour later we were finally seated
The help is very pleasant, but harried, probably due to the quirky layout of the place
OK, onto the food
All very good, the ramen dishes are quite ample on their own and the raved about buns are quite delicious
My biggest rap on this place(sans wait), are the prices
Forget about cheap sake and beer, a Stella Artois was $6 and the rest of the menu was on a similar par
What makes a joint like this fun is it's inexpensiveness in addition to the quality of the food
Try it and you too can say Been there, Done that
Order as many appetizers as you can and split a bowl of noodles, everything we tried ws amazing with surprising flavors and lightness despite the heavy reliance on fatty pork and bacon
I don't know what they do to poach eggs the way they do, but they taste like heaven
Had to-go a few days ago and was not dissapointed
Ordered the house ramen and the pork buns to see what all the rave was
The noodles were slightly undercooked and the broth was on the side and had to be added
Fresh ingredients and huge portion size
The soup broth could have had a bit more substance as it didn't have great flavor
Pork buns had great flavor, a good balance of sweetness and substance
They should consider adding a liner to the bottom of the container though as the pork bun absorbs the drippings and makes the bottom soggy a little
Overall, great value and quality for what you expect
nine dollars for two pork buns? any asian would LAUGH out loud at the idea (they average, what, fifty cent in CTOWN?)
no more laughing once you try these suckers
you will lay down your nine bucks with a smile and you will wait in line for the chance to do it again
the pork is delicious: sweet but savory and oh so tender
perfectly complemented by the crispiness of the cucumbers
what tops this dish is the BAO or the wrapper
whoever is making this has just head on NAILED it
there has never been more perfect bao
EVER
noodles are good -you can get better but who cares? PORK BUNS!!!
Not the place to go
Had their pan-fried dumpling which was too soggy and oily
Their signature momofuku noodle was just average
The poached egg was the only good/innovative part of the noodles
The prices lean on the more expensive side for this type of establishment
Bar stools are uncomfortable
Some seats of the noodle bar puts your head an inch away from the stranger's head sitting across from you
While eating the noodles, you could almost butt heads
Overall, i would not go back here
DEFINITELY better noodle places out there
This place is good for people who do not really know japanese food
For those who rave about this place, perhaps you need to leave the East Village and get out some?! And I'm not rating this next to gourmet dining before you jump all over this
As far as noodle shops go, the food was subpar
The service was atrocious
We had to ask the waitress to take our odor
Then she proceed to never serve us our food until we asked for it and was never around
Totally disorganized operation here
The lines outside are not enough to justify this total disregard for paying diners
Went with people who had been there before and suggested it and they were mortified at the experience this time and ashamed they recommended it so highly
Don't waste your money or time
If you don't like this place it is because you are a pretentious loser who wouldn't know good food unless you read about it in an uppity yuppity food guide
I take solace in the fact that there are so many of you loser pretentious asholes with sterile tastebuds; it makes this otherwise crowded and fantastic restaurant less then totally packed some of the time so I can eat there

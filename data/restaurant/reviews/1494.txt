We can't really assess the food but the dinner roll was average at best and the service terrible
After numerous positive reviews I figure I try out this place
The decor, atmosphere, pricing and service were good, however, I found the food highly disappointing
Plain and simple: the chef is in love with salt
Every dish we tried was drenched in salt
My wife and I typically don't mind salty foods and enjoy salty dishes if they were meant to be prepared that way, but the chef just went crazy with it
We had five items: The wild sea bass was blackened on the outside but not fully cooked on the inside
My wife took a couple of bites and pushed it to the side
The lobster roll was just drenched in mayo and surprisingly full of salt
Same story with the french fries
The spicy calamari salad was probably the best dish we had there but even that had too much salt
So needless to say we were disappointed
It reminded me of when I cook and I'm unsure of the flavoring/taste, I would just throw more salt on the food
We probably should have complained to our server, particularly about the sea bass, but at that point, we would have complained about all of the dishes
Its unfortunate as we were looking for a new seafood place in the area since both Pearl Oyster and Mary's Fish camp have become way too crowded
I've gone here with my wife 4 times in 3 months
The wine and the mussels were great
The owner (Marc) is so nice and welcomed us in when we were walking by the last time we went
In this day and age when owners see us as just wallets, its nice to have someone who cares enough to give an INCREDIBLE deal on wines and smile and talk with the customers
I just got an invite from them about 2 happy hours a day- That is just too cool
The food is simple and great, if a little on the pricey side, but you can get out of there with the knowledge that you saved on wine and were surrounded by super nice people
Don't get me wrong, the food is not expensive, it's just not super cheap but I love it! (if you couldn't tell)
a perfect place to get have a few after work drinks
the half wine by the bottle is genius, and not at all overpriced
i had the spicy calamari salad, raw oysters, lobster roll, and a mississippi mud pie
all were to die for
also went for breakfast one morning, it was ok, nothing too special
overall i would highly recommend ditch plains
I definitely recommend this restaurant
We went early, so it was quiet but the food was excellent and they serve breakfast , lunch, and dinner all day
Lots of fish on the menu , I had oysters and they were very fresh and the lobster roll which I def recommend
The atmosphere was also cool flat screen tv's above the bar- playing surfing videos and the staff was friendly and on point
it was good, but not that good
some of the food was great, other dishes overdone or bland (there were 6 of us, and we tasted each others dishes)
the service was spotty - those who got up for a smoke or to go to the loo had their napkins refolded as they got up
meanwhile, you need another greek beer and the two waitstaff 10 feet aware ignore you as they flirt with each other
Our fish was filleted like a 5 year old did it for the first time
And when we left a 20% tip (too much for what we received as service) split between a few credit cards, the manager came over and said we DIDN'T leave a tip! We of course told him to do the math again
we were right, he was wrong
He never corrected himself
If you want great Greek seafood with great service, DON'T eat here
Not only did they not honor our reservation, but they also were haughty and unapologetic
With all the wonderful restaurants in New York City, bearing in mind their expense, I would recommend that you not try Parea where they act like they are doing you a favor
Went there on a Sunday night - not overly crowded which was nice
Staff incredibly accomodating, service excellent, but most importantly, food was amazing
Everything we ordered - the tuna spinalo, the skate, the halibut, all incredible
All in all, great time
I went to Parea a few nights back and had an exceptional time
The restaurant itself is gorgeous and its architecture and design is beautifully simplistic
We ordered quite a few mezethes, (the small plates) to start
I had the crispy pork, zucchini, and tuna and scallop spinallo
All incredible dishes with tastes that I have never experienced before
The chef then knocked my socks off when I received my entree, the sea bass
Normally I am not a fan of the fish, however the bass was cooked to absolute harmony and perfection
We had a few deserts to finish and I had a tea that was so yummy I wish it came in a bottle, I would drink it everyday
i have now been here three times! i love going in and sitting at the bar/counter so that i can watch those cute guys cooking behind the counter! and seriously, i love the small plates, it is so nice to go in with friends and order a bunch of stuff and just share! the crispy pork is just melt in your mouth, the scallops are yummy, the asparagus salad
the cured meats
all of it is really wonderful, and the atmosphere is so nice as well
i highly recommend trying this place out, i would be surprised if you had a bad experience!
I work on 21st Street and I walked by it every day while under construction
I am now in love with this restaurant
I had an incredible dinner there last week and the both of us were treated like royalty
The small plates are amazing
the food, atmosphere and superb staff are going to make for one of New York City's best!!
Went with a Greek friend of mine and was seriously impressed
Apparently the chef is from Ohio, but this guy can cook
The small plates to share are like Greek tapas, and we got the octopus and the lobster grapeleaves
Both were great
Then we split the Whole Sea Bass, which was so flavorful, I'd never had a whole fish like that, especially without the bones
We even liked the wine which was mainly Greek
Check this place out!
After endless perambulating in search of the perfect brunch and on the verge of keeling over, I stumbled upon this seductive French eatery which had an outdoor seating area built to accomodate a perfect spring day
The menu offered any fantasy breakfast you could conjure up in your wildest
The service was impeccable and the breakfast package included a much needed alcohol beverage
The crepe and eggs florentino were prepared with love
The perfect neighborhood bakery! They make everything there in front of you, and it is all wonderful
They also have breakfast options and sandwiches
The decor is a simple country French feel with a long wood table inside and benches outside in the summer
Clinton Hill neighbors are sure to run into people they know as many people have made this place part of their life ritual
Wow
I finally was able to try out the JivamukTea cafe, which is tucked into the new Jivamukti Yoga School on Broadway between 13th and 14th Streets
I did not see any sign outside to indicate that there is a restaurant upstairs, so unless you happen to have heard about its existance, you'd never know that right above the street level Cosi Restaurant, a much yummier, pleasanter and tranquil cafe is just a few steps away
On the menu, there are many inexpensive snacks, drinks and meals to choose from
and all vegan
A great place to meet friends for tea, coffee, dessert or just to enjoy a solitary breakfast/lunch/dinner
Yesterday, I enjoyed a vegan BLT sandwich and the delicious lemon-limeade
Wish I was drinking it right now!
I went the other night, weeknight, party of 8
I had the ribs, maybe the best I've ever had, my kids and my mother inlaw had the shrimp alfredo, they all loved it and my oldest son, 16, said it was by far the best he ever had
Three people had the catfish and they all liked it, but no one raved about it
The steamed clams appetizer was excellent, white wine, garlic, parsley, lemon
We also had the mussels for an appetizer and they were excellent also
Everything was quite fresh, excellent combination of spices, and served hot
They decor is also super chill
Air conditioning was perfect (for men) at about 70 degrees
RB soundtrack playing
Bring a girl! Nice bar/lounge/crowd
Overall, an exceptionally good spot
My friend and I attended the soft opening last Thursday, the moment we walked into this establishment we were blown away by the decor, it gives you a very comfortable, yet exotic feeling
The staff was still in training but they were superb, especially Monique (she is great), the owner and manager were both very pleasant

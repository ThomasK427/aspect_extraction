Nutshell: If the company expense account is picking up the tab, this may be the place for you
otherwise look for another joint to drop $200/person
Great experience! Terrific food, expert service, elegant atmosphere!! Love this restaurant! Save room for the Cheese
One of the best meals I have ever had in NYC
The service was near perfect
We were there on a Friday night and it was a little noisy, but not bad
I would highly recommend Picholine!!!
one of my best dining experience in Ny
and certainly the best game birds you could find in the city
This is bar none the most perfect pre-theater dining experience in the city
Everything impressed me- the menu, wine list, gracefully expedient service and a beautiful dining room
I would advise anyone to go- whether you have theater tickets or not!
What a perfect dining experience
Everything was great
The staff polite and courteous and the food certainly outrageous
All of my seven course tasting menu were sublime
In fact the best tasting menu I have had in NYC
Bravo!! We shall return
i usually don't take the time to write reviews but Picholine deserves 30 seconds of my time
Last night I had one of the best dining experiences
The service was professional, attentive yet completely un-obtrusive
The food out of this world (lobster app) and decor old school and Grand
The only draw back was that Picholine was Packed and a bit loud
Perfect for a special occasion or just a great meal
Went to this delightful restaurant with my mother for the prix fixe lunch and the service was by far the best I've ever experienced
The staff was courteous without being officious or condescending
The portions were small, but thoroughly satisfying (granted, a linebacker for the dallas cowboys might not want to dine here
), and the food was excellent
The ambience is lovely, though old-fashioned
Perfect place to bring a date before the theater, a mother/ grandmother/ or aunt for their birthday, or friend for lunch
What a great experience I had last night at Picholine
The food was sublime and the service un-obtrusive and attentive
Every need was met, and we were NOT an easy group
Don't miss it!!!!!!!
Terence Brennan is unmatched
The evening was superb with food exquisite
I had the ditalini risotto with black truffles - OH MY!! The service was friendly and helpfu
A must in NYC!!
After trying most of the top restaurants in the city, the only one I keep coming back to is Picholine
The service is great, the food never disappoints and the atmosphere is perfect
I've been there for birthdays, aniversaries, etc
I always long to come back for the best cheeses and the best lobster in town
Thier prix fixe menu is not cheap, but it is a steal compared to the other alleged top restaurants
What a wonderful Meal!! Thank you so much for an exquisite experience
Your restaurant is beatiful, relaxing and elegant
Your food combinations were suprising, delicious and superbly presented
The wine was lusciuos and served at the right temperature which is so rare these days
The staff is very kind welcoming and caring
Thanks
Wonderful Service, nice presentation, informative cheese dude
Better than any restaurant in Phili
including Le Bec Fin Good Job!!!!!!
My wife and I recently celebrated our 2nd anniversary at Picholine
We were made to feel as if we were the only guests in the restaurant
The service was impeccable and the meal was sublime
Richard the sommelier really helped us with the wine
Thank You Picholine for the great experience
WE WILL BE BACK
Home of the micro portion
I'm a fit guy and when they served the lamb chop entre -- with two baby lamb chops -- I almost started laughing
Are they kidding? What a rip
I was saving Picholine for a special night and, well, I can only say i'm glad there are a few pizza places where you can grab a slice after dinner
I like the sommelier -- he wasn't pretentious and didn't try too hard to upsell me when we chatted at the bar
When i had to wait 15 minutes after the entree was cleared for the cheese tray, my enthusiam waned -- wish I could say the same for my apetite
Perhaps its the fact that Picholine seems to cater to older diners that may explain why I was thoroughly unimpressed with this restaurant
I thought the decor was dredfully boring, and the service snobbish (as did the previous reviewer)
Most importantly, I thought the food was very average and somewhat bland
I would definitely not suggest this restaurant to anyone under 40
The food lived up to it's reputation
This place is for serious food lovers ONLY
the timid must stay way
The sea urchin panna cotta and the shelfish paella are amazing
the staff was gracious and extremely accomadating towards our four month old baby
I also couldn't believe how busy the place and it just seemed GREAT
the prices are high but I don't mind paying for the BEST
and yes the cheese is also great!!!!!!!!!!
This is my second visit to Picholine
My first visit was before a show at the Lincoln Center, and it was extremely dissapointing, but I gave it a second chance after reading so many good reviews
The second visit confirmed that Picholine is truly a waste of money
I went there because it is so close to the Lincoln Center; next time I will eat somewhere else and take a cab to the performance
There are a lot high end restaurants in New York that pay tremendous attention to the periphery of their menu: amuse bouche, appetizers, starters, in-between courses, etc
But they often get just a satisfied--not exuberant--nod when diners tuck into the main course
That won't happen at Picholine
The menu is well-crafted, thorough, and the main course is as well put-together as any exciting introduction
Excellent
I think many of these glowing 10 reviews are phony, cooked up by the restaurant's puppets
We went for a pre-theatre meal
Awful
Cheese course, as other reviewers have noted, is interesting, but you'll do much better by going to Dean Deluca's and putting it together yourself
If you'd like to treat yourself and feel like a King or a Queen for the night, Picholine is your kind of place! The food was outstanding-especially the chef's treats that were on the house, of which I received three! (I especially enjoyed the tiered tray of pre-dessert confections)
The service was impeccable, the decor sublime
Sure, the prices are lofty, too, but well worth it
Relax and indulge yourself!
totally agree with 5/12 review
total waste
what an attitude!
I have been many times and two nights I had an experience that was wonderful eve by Picholine standards
The menu and food was great and the service attentive and sincere
I will be back againn
Picholine no doubt garners and exploits the pre-theater (Lincoln Center) crowd

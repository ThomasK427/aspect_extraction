I say bravo! to Chubo and the staff for making a pleasant dining experience for me and my partner!
This prix fixe restaurant is really fantastic
For $24, you get a really nice appetizer, entree, and dessert
I went with 3 friends on a weeknight and were promptly seated
The server was very friendly and knowledgable
The decor is homey with exposed brick walls and roman blinds
Even though the place got a bit crowded later in the evening, we didn't feel rushed
I'll definitely be going back here again!
to put it simply, this place is really bad
the food is bad
the servers and cook are bad and need to learn service etiquette
korean food is delicious so please don't think temple constitutes korean food
temple is really really bad
this is NOT the place to go and it's really suspect that they have some good reviews
i agree with the other reviewer that said the good reviews were written by the owners or their friends because no matter optimistic you are, there's unfortunately nothing really good to say about this place
sorry
just remember not to go there and waste your time and money
We ordered from Temple because it''''s the only Korean place near the lower east side that delivers
The eel bi bim bop doesn''''t come with any of the usual vegetables that constitute bi bim bop so for $14 dollars I got some greasy rice (tasted like popcorn) with eel on top
Great
Of the five famous sides (as if they invented kim chee) we only got four and they came in one ounce containers
Since they only sent one set (even though we ordered two entrees) the portion was good for one bite each
You can do better elsewhere, and by elsewhere I mean anywhere
I've been to many korean restaurants but this will be the first place that serves dumpling that is supermarket bought
They were awful and certainly expensive at $4 during lunch hour
Very deceptive practice and I was not happy
This restaurant is small but beautifully decorated, with spashes of color and natural elements
The service is wonderful- timely, polite, and helpful
With our check, my friend and I received a complementary ginger honey tea
The prices are reasonable and they offer lunch specials that shave a few dollars off
The food was prepared quickly, but with our high expectations, I have to say I was slightly dissapointed
It was nothing special to rave over
If you really want authenticity and good food
don't bother
I live next door to Temple; I've eaten there several times and I walk by it daily
I agree with the reviewer who stated that the people who have given overly positive reviews are probably friends of the owner (a smart move -- these reviews, along with the ones printed on the door and the high Zagat rating bring in a lot of people)
The food is decent, not great or 100% authentic, but that's not what you go for -- it's the location and the ambience (cute, trendy) that make this place unique and a nice change from K-town
It is always crowded, which is not surprising considering it only seats about 15 people (the restaurant is like one long hallway with some sidewalk seating)
Service can get slow during busy hours, but is usually gracious
The side dishes change regularly, but are tasty (although portions are very small)
My friend and I stumbled upon Temple at lunch yesterday and were very pleased
The space is tiny, but pretty and comfortable
Our server was charming and speedy
And the food was close to perfection
I loved my kimchee stew with bits of shredded pork and just enough hotness to clear the sinuses, but not kill all other flavors
I think this would make a perfect hangover cure or an afternoon warmer on a deep winter's day
It came with perfectly prepared sticky rice and a selection of 5 vegetable appetizers
My friend had the beef bulgogi, also served with the rice and 5 apps
The beef was tender and delicately marinated, a salty/sweet miso dipping sauce was just right and for extra spice we asked for a side of hot sauce
Our lunch, with 2 large Korean OB beers, was about $30 - a bargain
The menu at Temple reads like the owners rummaged around the city and patched together a collection of somewhat sloppy, overly stylized dishes to entice certain demographical crowd
All too sanitized and saccharinated
Well, this is, after all, East Village
The quality of service mirrors their food
I walked into Temple hoping to experience the authenticity of Korean cuisine, or something that evokes Park Soo Keuns portraits of humble and ordinary life
Instead I found myself humming Yeats' the Song of the Old Mother with the pubescent zeal of waitresses reminiscent of Ganguro girls
boink
Disappointing, but not inedible
Whoever designed this place did a great job! It is simple yet beautiful
Romantic lighting, candles and fresh flowers
A cozy little place to enjoy tasty Korean food
The ddukboki (spelling?) appetizer was delicious
The bibimbap was very good, too
Friendly service, too
I read a great article from NYT recently and went there
I was stunned and dumb founded!~ As a Korean I'm worried that the Americans who do not know true korean food will be mislead and be disappointed by the quality of the food and culture
The freshest quality that Temple emphasize is worthless
KTC looks cozy but not sanitary and the dishes were not tasty
People who want to have a taste of true Korean food please go try other neighboring places or K-town
Do not waste your time and money here, not worth a dime
The place looks cozy and cute from outside but it's small seating and loud abnoxious music makes you wonder if it's worthwhile for a dinning experience
I've had far tasty and authentic Korean food from else where and I felt mislead by all the reviews on the door
As soon as it got packed the food took forever to come to our table and the table was so sticky, they need to clean their tables!~
This restaurant has the best kimchi chige I have ever had
Thank you Temple!
We were suprised to find a Korean restaurant in EV
Their price was unbeatable, and food and service was excellent
I recommend it
I love this place because they serve Korean food with vegetarian option
I didn't want beef in my bibimbop, and they asked me if I wanted tofu instead
Why not? I love this place
We were seriously disappointed by the rude service (They left out the noodles in a dish
When we pointed this out, they immediately donned a bad attitude
It was their mistake yet they were unacceptably rude and discourteous
) and the subpar food that shouldnt be called Korean cuisine (We know because most of us are Korean and grew up with REAL Korean cuisine
One dish tasted like water with floating spice
)
How was this place ranked as one of the best Korean restaurants?? I would expect better from Citysearch
Someone in the boondocks whos never tasted Korean food would cook Korean food better than the unfortunate attempts of Korean Temple Cuisine
They cant put the two words-Korean cuisine-together in their name because they know its a lie and that the food would disappoint any knowing Korean
Hope this review helps! Dont waste your money/time here
Its a sad disappointment
Great service and food for the couples and friends to enjoy
The owner gave us personal attention
The waitress was terrific and the food was even better! The the jewel of the Village -- a must for those who love Korean food or those who've always wanted to try it
It's a great introduction to the food and culture!
I've never been disappointed by the food at this rest
I've been going since it opened and just love the food
Make sure to ask the owner for her advice on matching a good bottle of wine with the stellar dishes
Never expected to see a Korean restaurant in East Village, nor expected to have food and price this good

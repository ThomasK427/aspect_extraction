This smallish cafe is home to the best food in the area
My date and I had the rack of lamb and the balsamic chicken respectively and the word perfect wouldn't do justice to how well our food was prepared
This place is definitely a secret and a treat to those who have ventured down 86th St
I truly hope that it remains as quiet and unassuming so I can continue to enjoy the tremendous effort that comes from the kitchen
P
S
Their wine list is excellent and the by-the-glass menu rivals any in NYC!
Roma is an unassuming and certainly unpretentious little corner pizza haven that offers the best slice on the Upper East Side and perhaps the city
A no-nonsense approach to pizza makes the focus on the food and will leave the customer wanting more
The ambience at this place leaves alot to be desired, even compared to the 96th street location, but the food is tasty, and the specials are a great deal (usually soup/salad, main entree with sides, dessert, and tea/cofee) for $12-20
Just had the best wing since being upstate
Great feel, great service, couldn't ask for much more
Great crowd, great wings and great food
Perfect location and owned by graduates from the prestigious Xavier High School
How can you top that?
The bone has not only great burgers but outstanding wings
Great bar scene after a good meal
weekend DJ's make it a great scene
This place has the best burger in town, try the blue chesse burger!
The pasta dishes here are great! I ordered tortellini bolognese and they made it fresh, brought it out on real dishes, and it was delicious
They have a great variety of sauces and pastas
I can't wait to try the gnocchi next time!
Quality chinese takeout
great dumplings
good prices
I'm still searching for the best takeout on the UE, but this has been my staple for over 2 years
I still venture to find something better, but for now, this is a can't go wrong
I had Dumpling King for Take-Out and it was quick and tasty
I love dumpings and Chinese food, but I don't greasy food
Dumpling King is not greasy and it's a good deal with 6 free dumplings over $10
This bar has been always been great but now the creme can truley rise to the top
Rumour has it that DJ Sugar will soon be spinning there! This local bar will soon be rocking with the hiptylings that only sugar can bring! Can't wait!
This place was terrible
The employees were all so rude and clearly thought that they worked somewhere much better than they do
The bouncers treated the place as if it is some hot spot when it is nothing but a neighborhood bar
They clearly don't care if people enjoy their experience and seemed to care less if people come back
I, for one, won't!!
I heard about this place, and then I saw their web site
So we went there and it was like going back in time
the wacky owner-bartender Mark makes the place like every frat party/mardi gras/theme bar from hell
so its a wicked cocktail mixed up that succeeds in having fun
you find another bar that draws whites, blacks, latins, asians and who-knows all in one spot
we got drunk and i lost her in the crowd
oh well!!
Who's On First is one of the most divers bars that you will find on 1st Ave! You've got different races, age groups, music and ofcourse, most importantly: drinkers
And who can go wrong with all of the GREAT dink specials that the WACKY owner does during the couse of the night! If you like to drink, meet people, listen to great music and just have fun, Who's On First is the place to be!!
Maybe it was because it was superbowl sunday
or maybe it was because this place is just plain awful, but I had a HORRIBLE experience with Atomic Wings
I ordered early Sunday morning for Atomic to deliver at 530
Finally after calling for two hours, I walked over there to pick up the delivery at 730, and they gave me my overpriced order which were disgustingly raw, were about half the size of normal wings, and had no flavor to them!
i've generally been pleased with atomic wings (esp
the midtown location on the west side), but i was shocked at what i recently received via delivery from the 3rd ave, UES location: no less than 8 of the 20 wings i ordered were petrified, meaning waaaay over-fried or they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours
they weren't just bad, but simply not edible
some of the remaining (presumably edible) wings were undercooked, which furthers my theory that half my order came from a batch that was sitting under heat lamps for hours
overall, the wings also lacked sufficient sauce and were disappointingly dry
in the future, i'm going to stick to the sports bar around the corner from me
i recently had take-in from this place -- never, never again
while the delivery was rather quick, i soon figured out why -- the food tasted as if it had been sitting under a heater for hours
i had ordered a full order of chicken and ribs and what showed up would not have been enough, quantity-wise, for a 4-year old child
the chicken was dry and tasteless, the baby back ribs were puny, bbq-sauceless, and all bone
i'm utterly shocked this place has been in business since 1983 and i think the positive reviews posted here were written by employees or those without tastebuds or appetites
The Scene With three outposts around town, Sarabeth's Kitchen has become a well-known and reliable spot for casual dining at breakfast, lunch or dinner
This Madison Avenue outpost has a citified rustic decor featuring small pastry cases, mullion windows, bentwood chairs and brass touches
The Food Lines form early on weekends for chive-scrambled eggs, pumpkin waffles lavished with sour cream, sticky buns and raisin scones and quality baked goods
Lunch and dinner follow similar patterns-seasonal highlights include a robust autumn-vegetable salad with apples, cheddar, celery root and the cornmeal-crusted crabcake with julienne beets, sweet peppers and watercress
Desserts include simple winners like the candied pecan tarte and the spicy gingerbread ice cream

My friend and I went for breakfast at Sarabeth on May 21, 2006 as it was recommended by the hotel's concierge as the best breakfast in town
The wait was long, our server was in a horrible mood and never smiled, and both the food and the ambience of the place were average
But what really shocked me was that we were charged 18% gratuity when we received the bill
When I asked her about it, she said that that's their policy
I can understand that for big groups, but it was just the two of us
As we were tourists in NYC, we thought maybe this was the norm so we didn't say anything more
But later found out that the server had actually lied to us
Overall, a terrible experience on our last day in NYC
I had brunch there after all the glowing reviews
It was nothing that I couldn't have gotten at a diner only cheaper
Coffee was of diner quality
I had lemon ricotta pancakes
They were 5 or 6 SMALL pancakes with some lemon flavor
Some fresh strawberries were placed on the plate around them
I also had Holland pork and apricot sausage
They were plain pork sausages sitting in a dish of some apricot sauce
My partner had a standard veggie wrap
Those items with two cups of coffee was 38 dollars
I was not stuffed
The waitress was friendly but very busy
I'd say there are better and cheaper places for breakfast that don't require a 30 minute wait
My wife and I were in New York for a week and we ate at Sarabeth's Kitchen on the Upper West Side on Amsterdam Ave three of those days
We loved it! Expect big portions and the omelettes were great
I had the french toast which was great too! Not a bad place to see a star or two
Expect a little wait on the weekends
the waits are outrageous
I've been to Sarabeth's twice, and both times service was gracious, fast and efficient
The coffee is good, and they keep it coming
The jams and rolls are outstanding, and they make great omelettes and pancakes
The decor, however, is a bit garish (think cute dollhouse at teatime), and some of their couches need immediate replacing (I was 2'-3' below the rest of the people in my party; the couch sank that much!)
I'm still debating if it is worth waiting for one hour or more
On a cold Sunday we read the menu in the window
We looked at the other tables and saw the eggs, the waffles, the brunch

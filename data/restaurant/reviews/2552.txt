can and a plastic cup
A little different, but that just fits in with the vibe of the joint
Don't give a second thought about taking the 6 train to 116th St
and walking the four blocks to the restaurant
This is a largly latino community, and we saw plenty of families on the street doing evening shopping
Also passed lots of little restaurants serving Mexican food
The sounds of latin music and smells of that food made me want to go back! On the walk back to the subway we were cracked up by three older gents (in their 60s or 70s) sitting near the subway entrance chatting while their boom box was belting out latin tunes
I have been to all the top pizza places in the U
S
and seen all the reviews in all the magazines and guides
This is it
THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN THE USA
Period
It's better than Sally's Pepe's in New Haven
Better than Grimaldi's and Johns and Naples 45 and Tontono and Lombardi's
This is a perfect food
The only place close to this is Johnny's Pizza in Mt
Vernon, NY
The only reason Patsy's is barely mentioned in the national surveys is the location
Few make it up to 117th street, so they just say that they like John's because it's in the Village and that's what they know
Get a pie, not the takeout
Some of the other reviews here are silly
Got to PizzaHut for globs of plastic toppings and 'good soda' and lighting
Go here for the best pizza in the USA
When ever I find myself uptown at lunchtime, there is only one place I head to -- IT'S PATSY'S PIZZA
There pizza is simply the best I've had anywhere the USA
This is, without a doubt, the best slice of pizza in Manhattan
Fantastic sauce, suberb crust and just the right amount of mozzerella
the food is great but the atmosphere is really not pleasant
and the service is non-existing
:(
I traveled here with my high school church youth group of 20
They provided excellent service with the best tasting pizza and pasta I have ever had
great food and atmosphere! best puttanesca I have evre had!
I really dislike Italian restaurants not run by Italians, this is now another example of one
The food is extremely inconsistent and the ingredients are cheap
Seems like they have traded away quality for value
pizza should have more than 1 piece of topping per slice
where the heck have all the toppoings gone? they charge 2
00 per topping and give you 2 cents worth
not worth the pizza
HEY FOLKS I GREW UP JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM PATSY'S IN THE LATE FIFTY'S
I TAKE MY SON THERE TIL THIS DAY
PIZZA IS THE BEST AND THE AMBIENCE IS GREAT
GREAT NEW YORK MEMORIES
WHEN MY BUDDY FLY'S UP FROM FLORIDA HE RUNS TO PATSY
The back of the restaurant was kind of dark and not very attractive
Need to spruce it up and add better lighting
More ambiance in back
Also needs to be tidied up - things like child seats sitting around
I HAVE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE IT AND I'M ITALLIAN
sweetest,freshest and most lean pizza anywhere
2 minutes, don't even bother to call ahead
just do a round trip with the cab
Patsy's is the best in NYC
I used to go to the original Patsy's on Old Fulton in Brooklyn
That's when would be sitting there noshing when Sinatra's limo would pull up to get his order
Gotta love it
I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce
great brick oven pizza, and big-sized dishes (salads and pasta dishes are fantastic!)
it can fill up quickly, so be prepared for a wait, and the seating can be a little cramped
but the service is hospitable and accommodating, and the food is affordable, delicious and filling
correct ambience is gone
food pizza is totally inconsitence, burned bottom soggy crust other times dry sauce is not consistent,seems to change
sad to see it go downhill after all these years
Great food great atmosphere, can eat this pizza any time of the day!!!!
patsy's pizzas are so fresh and delicious that a simple cheese pie sends you to heaven
they're not greasy and the crust is just perfect
if ONLY they delivered
patsy's on 3rd is a very good hang out place to see new york at its best
it can be crowded and noisy
but the food is always excellent and very good value
it is uncomplicated and fast
you are never disappointed
they rate better to me than John's mainly because not only is their pizza so good but also they have a very good assortment of tasty salads
I hate Johns soggy industrial lettuce and bland tomatoes with too much onions
Blows John's outta the water
Patsy's is the best reliable pizza in the city
For serious pizza connoisseurs
Stark dining room, no beer, no fuss
Sit down, order promptly, and obey your waiter
You WILL love the pies for their perfection alone
The only true NY style pizza left in the city
Do not recommend for parties of more than 5-7, unless you get there at 5:30pm
Incredibly good pizza: thin crisp tasty crust, sauce that is tangy, great cheese
Okay, I gotta go eat there again, just thinking about it
I've tried over half the contenders listed within this poll
However, after dining at Patsy's, Ive come to understand the difference between a mere slice and the possibilities of pizza
The pepperoni's cut real thick--Yum
The pizza itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already
You've tried the rest, now eat the best! Grab the bus and enjoy the pies
Can get very crowded on Thursday and Friday's lunch hour
Pizza is just divine! Their pasta dishes as well as their salads are top notch
Family Style dishes
Patsy's is the original New York pizza
Just remember to bring cash

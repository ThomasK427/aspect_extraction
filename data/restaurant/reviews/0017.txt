there's nothing better than getting good chinese food for less than 5 bucks
and the take out tupperware is a plus for college students, since it's good for future use
=) food for less than 5 AND free tupperware
shweeet
This place is best described as a Chinese fast-food type restaurant - the waiters are quick to seat you and with a wave of a hand, they will quickly come to take your order
Your food will arrive just as quickly and the prices are very good for such big, delicious portions
Conchee, rice or a noodle dish---their all just as good
Service is lightening fast
Zero decor, this is not a date place--just a great place to get a quick, tasty and cheap meal
Just because you can have lunch for less than $7 does not mean it is good
For great cheap eats and real authentic Chinese food, come here
i have always loved beef omelettes but i never realized how good a roast pork omelette could be until i tried one at big wong's
what's not to like? price? good
portions? good
pork? good
oyster sauce? gooooooood
and of course my roast pork omelette is not complete without an order of seasonal vegetables with oyster sauce
i love oyster sauce!
Don't let the cheap price fool you! It's inexpensive but the food is delicious
Try the different types of congee aka (rice porridge or rice soup) with the fried cruller! Seafood Congee is one of my favorite and Big Wong has one of the best seafood congee ever~
Good quick food
Great bargain
They had the best duck and wontons
Since many of their old staff moved to another restaurant after management changed, most of the old customers don't frequent at BigWong
We all go to the new place where the old staff are
Generous portions of rice porridge and noodles really hit the spot after fighting the crowds on a busy weekend in Chinatown
No time to eat? Call ahead for takeout and fly by for soup dumplings on the road
If you ever forget your walllet and happen to be hungry, try gathering up some loose change and go dine at Big Wong
They have been a mainstay in chinatown for years now with their traditional cantonese cuisine
Ive been going to Big Wong for years now and have maybe tried half of the menu already
My favorites are the wontons, congee, and roast pork on rice
These three dishes would overly satisfy a 200 pound man and would have only cost him $9
I would caution you in regard to the interesting decor
There is constant hustle and bustle in which the staff is constantly shifting around roasted animals
Table sharing is also a possibility
Food is good and what you would expect from a rest located in China town
I like to call it the Soup Nazi of Chinese food - filling, cheap, delicious Chinese fast food, but woe to the person who gets to the front of the line and still hasn't made up his mind! No reservations, cash only, closes early
You can get lunch for under $5
The Scene Bo Ky is a Vietnamese no-frills noodle shop with some 30 different soups
Don't expect much ambiance--despite a recent expansion, you may be asked to sit with strangers, and you'll be served tea in styrofoam cups
The Food Outstanding soup choices include the chicken curry, which mixes egg noodles with eggplant, potatoes, and fresh lemon, all in a spicy coconut curry broth
Or belly up to the beef belly soup, made with wide chow fun noodles and a thick, beefy broth
Lighter broth soups are available with noodles and seafood, fish, duck, pork, or meat balls in almost any combination you can imagine
Although the menu lists barbecued duck and chicken dishes, you're better off sticking to the soups
Yea it smells good just standing outside the restaurant
Though I find that the portions are very small
An idea of what you will see eating there? Foam cups with tea, disposible chopstix and not much on the menu to choose from
Forget about the fried noodle, pork fried dumplings or even chicken fried rice
After eating there, I felt like I should had went some where else
i suggest you think twice if you want to visit this restaurant the service was really bad and don't even think of getting delivery cause the person that answers the phone is gonna hang up on you just like they did to me
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years
I usually get one the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious
You can eat gourmet food at a fast food price
This restaurant actually serves Chieu Chow style (a group of ethnic Chinese people who came from Vietnam) foods
The country duck is one of their most famous menu dishes
The taste is completely different for people who have only eaten Chinese styled barbecue meats
The duck is slowly braised in a special marinade
It is absolutely delicious and flavorful
The best foods are the noodle soups
Be daring, try it dry and they will give you soup on the side and add spices and oils to toss the hot noodles
What's great is that you can create your own combination adding and picking whatever you want in the bowl
Great comfort food any day
My boyfriend and I both received close to raw burgers
The fries were old, cold and disgusting
We decided to give it a second chance
So when his mom was in town we went back and each ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich which was on their special's menu
Horrible
There will not be another stop at this place
For lunch- $50 is unacceptable
The name is deceiving
This was by far one of the worst dining experience I've ever had
I wasn't expecting much, but the cheesey decor, the bad service and mediocre food just added to the horrible experience
Please, please don't waste your money (85 cents for a slice of tomato on your overpriced sandwich
$9 baked potato with chili- please!!)
This is a busy spot from 1130 AM to 130 PM M-F but you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, unless you have a large party, thanks to fast and friendly service provided by the waitstaff and kitchen
In about the same time you could stand in line for a fast-food burger and fries you get a cooked-to-order juicy treat served with a generous portion of hearty steak-fries
If you're not in the mood for a burger, try the meatloaf or turkey sandwich
Both are served open-faced with gravy
Yum! This place is a mid-town gen
Great spot on 8th floor of Saks Fifth Avenue
Very large menu from light salads to Steak and Lobster
Food was terrific and service was very friendly and efficient
A perfect compliment to a day of shopping
I go just for lunch when in the area even if not shopping
Lovely afternoon tea service
Awesome birdseye views of Rock Ctr and St

In Short This Indian bistro is stylish and vibrant, with orange-and-red walls and exotic aromas wafting from the kitchen
Sit next to NYU and New School professors and students dining on food adapted from Goa, Punjab and southern India, including Goan fish curry and Galina Xacutti--chicken and potato simmered in a puree of coconut and spices
Desserts include a sweet masala chai and keer, and cardamom- and saffron-flavored rice pudding
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down

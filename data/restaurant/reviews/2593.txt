waiter acted kind of snobby
would try a different restaurant next time
Went on a Saturday evening, able to get table for 2 after 15 min wait despite pre-theater crowd
Prices are reasonable for midtown Italian food and service was friendly if a little absent-minded beacuse of the pre-theater rush
Food is ok, don't expect anything too creative
Convenient if you or any guests you're entertaining from out of town is staying at a hotel in the Times Square area
Once the theater crowd rushed out to catch their shows, it was more relaxed and you can linger over coffee without being shoo-ed out
We found a very nice restaurant a half block from Times Square
The pastas were wonderful; the decor modern but not overdone; the prices reasonable
I ordered delivery from this restaurant based on the previous positive reviews and was very disappointed
The food took an hour to come
Nothing I ordered was in the bag
Another hour later, I had received my original order and everything was horrible
The pasta was soggy and bland, the chicken dry and the bread hard as a rock
Definitely skip this place
I was worried about such small restaurant in the theatre district
However, 10 of us went on Sunday after the matinee and we were very pleasantly surprised! The place was not crowded, it was spacious and the food and service were terrific
The prices weren't too bad either
I would like to say that the service was excellent and the staff really nice
However, I would like to get to the food
We ordered drinks, appetizers, dinner and desert
The drinks were excellent, appetizers ok
Bread served at table was like store bought onion rolls
Fresh Italian bread not in sight
Calamari was ok, but had a very strange dipping sauce, creamy horseradish or something
Brushetta was good, but three very small slices of bread
Dinner-spicy chicken and and hot chicken sausage (not hot, and chicken was dry, not tender)
Good flavor in the sauce, however
Another chicken dish, with sundried tomatoes, ok, but nothing great and finally, eggplantparm was good
Menu lacking, need basics, like marsalla chick or veal
I give it a 0 for food presentation Deserts excellent, creamy cheesecake and excellent Tirimisu
I came with a group of friends and everything was perfect
The staff was friendly and helpful
The angel hair pasta with salmon was delicious and servings were adequate for 2 people
Go before 8pm so you can try the Pre-theater menu which is a steal for $25! The atmosphere is nice and cozy
perfect for everything from a romantic dinner for two to a big reunion of old friends
Casa di Meglio made us feel right at home
I went here on a Monday evening after work with some girlfriends
It was dead, quiet and very quick
The food was great, the pasta dishs were amazing
Casa is good for a great meal without all the fuss
The Kodama folks must have read these awful reviews and gotten their act together because the food is fantastic!! the fish is super fresh, and they have wonderful specials each week
I would suggest the Manhattan roll, Avenue Q roll, and Celi roll for you vegeterians out there
So ok, aesthetically is not the prettiest place, but who cares about that when you have FRESH sushi? The prices are quite reasonable for NYC anyways
it's no more expensive than any other Japanese place
For those of you who hated it, you should give it another try
It's become my favorite sushi in Midtown
I read reviews before I went to this restaurant last night but I trusted a friend and I am glad that I did
We had a great meal
We felt that everything was fresh and the tasty
It is not a beautiful restaurant but if you want good food for a great value, I would try it
The food is worse than most takeout sushi, rice bowl places but I was shocked that beef teriyaki entrees were 16$
I guess it's a convenient location in that it's midtown, but the fish tastes like it's been in the freezer to long and the beef and chicken felt like rubber in my mouth
No wonder we were one of the only people in there
I'm never going back
Though the food at Kodama is pretty darn average, there is one exceptional maki that they make - the Canadian Roll
Raw salmon, spicy greens and a special spicy garlic sauce that they don't use with any other dish
Very highly recommended
Kept us going back again and again
Eventually our order consisted of a couple Canadian rolls and whatever sushi pieces were especially fresh that night
The miso and salad are great too
Little deceived by the high rating
The other reviewers were right, the service with an attitude doesn't go well with their average sushi - but we thought to give Kodama a try, try we did it's our last try
Fish was just ok, good variety of rolls, spicy rolls ok
There is better at Raku or Tomoe
I have been coming here for years and have been very loyal
But witnessing the service attitude change has been disappointing (with other customers)
The food is OK but no longer amazing
Quality and consistency varies though I have been forgiving
But my friend found another spot nearby and we are moving on to 'smaller but better'
It was a good run while it lasted
Stayed at the W Hotel - checked citysearch for nearby sushi spots
Tho Blue Fin Kodama had low ratings I normally like to try for myself
Out of my 3 day stay here tried these 2 Raku
Should have respected the ratings as the sushi was ok, I sure don't see/taste the raves the others have given
Seems their service is suspect as it was not attentive for a small restaurant
Next time I will stay with Raku as their rating holds true over time
The spicy tuna/salmon/scallops are far superior at Raku's though Kodama does have some interesting selections
But for fresh best sushi/rolls/lobster I vote for Raku the value is ultra-fare for midtown prices
Although the quality of their service is below average, I've been to Kodama more than several times because the food is good and it's conveniently located
Kodama's staff are usually unfriendly and pokerfaced at best
However, there is this one waitress that seems to have personal problems with me
Maybe too much tip bothers her and she'd rather be under-tipped? I'd ignore her bad service but last time I was there, it was too obvious that she didn't want to wait our table
She intentionally ignored my call, it took us way longer than usual to get our food
Other people who came after us were leaving while we were waiting for food
I am not going back to this restaurant again
It almost ruined my evening and I had to wonder if she put anything other than eatable in my food
Watch out for waitress server id #4!
I go to Kodama at least once a month
I'm addicted to the spicy tuna rolls and a newer one called Canadian
They are a bit expensive, but I really enjoy the food
I go to kodama at least once a month
The sushi is amazing as well as the grilled calamari appetizer
One must try the oyster tempura rolls and also the scallop rolls
Great service and amazing food!
Good food?? The salmon teriyaki was served cold, and the sushi portions were moderate to skimpy
Those who rave about the food must not realize there are many other Japanese choices
In my own outer borough neighborhood, the food is MUCH better
Great service?? Our waiter was condescending and rude
He did nothing to earn a tip, but he gave us the check with a 15% tip already included

I will not go there anymore, it is a good restaurant if you have 3 hours to kill
It is very difficult to find Brunch on Saturday in Bay Ridge
Cebu has an amazing brunch and would be worth waiting until Sunday
They put a yummy twist on otherwise ordinary dishes like French Toast and a Bacon, Egg Cheese sandwich
The atmosphere is casual friendly
I will have to try their dinner menu very soon!
I took my parents here for brunch when they came to visit
Both my parents and I were amazed by the great service, delicious food, outstanding value, and overall quality of the experience
My parents believe that to get anything worth while in Ny you have to spend a lot of cash, but this place proves that great food and ambience can be affordable and wonderfully delicious
I Love This Place!
Whether you dine indoors or out, this place is quiet and relaxing with excellent service that is friendly and helpful no matter what time of day it is
The food is inventive and tasty, and the prices are about what you'd expect at this sort of spot
It's a favorite neighborhood spot of mine, and I'd definitely recommend it
Cebu is my favorite restaurant for so many reasons
There's the efficient and pleasant wait staff who are always smiling
There's the great food that never lets you down
(The chef will even make something special for you upon request
) There's the warm ambiance with it's dark lighting and fireplace in the back
And another plus is they serve dinner 'till 3am - great for late-eaters
Everything on the menu is fantastic but I reccomend the chipotle chicken (spicy but amazing!) and the guacamole
Other little things like having your own bottle of water on the table and a delicious roasted red pepper dipping sauce for the bread (instead of plain old butter) are what makes this bistro truly a pleasure! Only con: tables are a little too close together - if you need your space - opt for a booth in the front
Great food, great price and great service
One of the best brunches you will find
Cebu is one of the more welcome additions to Bay Ridge
As far as food goes, it's reliable, and consistent - which for Bay Ridge is really what one should be expecting
Brooklyn by and large isn't going to give you the culinary experience of it's next door neighbor, and Cebu knows this, to it's credit it's formula is simple - let them eat late and let them eat well
Good product, combined with very personable service, a late kitchen, makes it a much-needed alternative to the stomach turning diners of the area
Turnover is good late night munchies are going to cost you - like so many places around here that have priced for the migration of yuppies and nouveau riche
I've been to Cebu on a number of occasions and have never come away disappointed
They have such a wide variety of food, there is something for everyone! From Burgers, to Pasta dishes, Filet Mignon, Chilean Sea Bass (one of my favorites) and so much more! The staff is always polite and friendly, which really adds to the warm atmosphere
Do yourself a favor and go check it out! I'm sure you'll walk away smiling!
over the weekend a bunch of friends got together to have drinks and dinner and i most say it was great, everything was wonderful u have to try the steam clams, fried oyster,duck entree
desert was tasty the fried banana tortilla to died for
the place is fun the music was really nice and great martini
i will be back
i especially love that they serve late realy late
you should check out this place
see for yourself how great the place is
enjoy!
I was actually on my way to another rest
and it was getting ready to close-they recommended Cebu-and myself and some friends went-we were surprised that they serve till 3am-everynight! the food was much better than I expected for a bistro! it had a real comfortable feeling to it ! check it out! the back room had a fire place--my girlfriend loved it!
I've ordered from Fuel for a year now
I'm not sure if they changed management, but their service has plummeted
They always sound annoyed to take my order
Even more put out if I ask for delivery
And the food, once it arrives, tastes horrible
Word to the wise: call the 95th Street location
MUCH MUCH better: tasty and friendly
The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating
I couldn't believe how good the prices were
The Pa-Jun (Scallion/Seafood Pancake) was the best one I've had period
Not too many onions, just the right texture and fluffiness of the pancake
I asked if their Yook Gae Jang (Spicy Beef Vegetable Soup) was good
She answered, It's your first time here, huh? haha
so cute!   I honestly loved the Kal-Bee (BBQ Short Ribs)
Not too salty or garlic-y- the beef was tender, and oh-so yummy to wrap up in lettuce
Then you stuff it all in your mouth
The space could be a little bigger, but it's still a great place to go w/ a date or a few buddies
LOVE the location
we need more Korean places in Bay Ridge
sheesh
Try the Mochi for dessert
A little while ago, I saw the rating for this place was around 7
1 and I was shocked
I have been eating at this place for about a year now, and I can't say enough about it
The food is absolutely excellent, and the service is outstanding! It is a family-run business, and the previous reviewer was correct in saying that they treat you like family, even when you are not Korean
The fact that you will see other Koreans eating there is a good enough indication that it is a good Korean restaurant
I recommend the bulgogi, and the stone pot bibimbap (the food stays hot throughout the entire meal)
If you have a chance, you should definitely try this place- it is a refreshing break from the mediocre food and service you get from the other restaurants nearby
perhaps the only thing better than the food is the service
the manager and staff treat you like family and on two occassions the chef came out to chat
unlike flushing you are not penalized for not being korean
a bit cramped for big parties but otherwise cozy and comfortable
highly recommend the stone pot bibimbap (which stayed hot till the very last bite) and the tofu stew
a bit tricky to find parking but patience with the meter spots pays off
a god send to brooklynites who cannot live without korean food
The Scene Floor-to-ceiling front windows make an unusual statement for a Smith Street bistro, but gauzy lace curtains, crisp linens on the tables, and exposed brick walls help warm the space
Owner Leslie Bernat greets neighborhood patrons with a heavy French accent and makes recommendations on the reasonably priced wine list while her husband, Jean-Jacques, cooks away in the kitchen
A packed pastry case near the entrance reminds diners to save room for dessert
The Food The menu ably pulls off Bistro 101: The generous cheese plate makes a big enough starter for at least three people to share, and French onion soup is rich and decadent
Salmon comes perfectly seared with a white wine and Dijon sauce, and tender, sliced steak boasts addictive frites
Disappointments are limited to a too-heavily dressed portobello salad and a bland bouillabaisse
Housemade desserts--like sweet and creamy Napoleons, unusual and pleasing pistachio-apple tarts and chocolate-hazelnut layer cakes--are the pieces de resistance
After reading a great review in the NY Times, I decided to dine here
To my surprise, I was turned away by the waitress, saying that they had no tables, but there were many empty tables
What's up with that! I'll never go back
For the location and ambience you would expect better service from the staff
However, this place is understaffed
I waited 40 minutes for a menu, 15 more for a drink and then an hour later our food was brought to the table - along with the apps
They offered free drinks and dessert - so we didn't mind
The ban they have there is awesome, so if you have time, why not check it out
I recently attended a celebratory dinner here and I just want to warn everyone that the service is the worst I have ever experienced! We were a large party, over 6 people, and after our initial drinks, which included a couple bottles of wine, and order were taken we did not see a waiter or a busboy again for over an hour!! The appetizers came out haphazardly, we waited 2 hours for our entrees and the only reason we even got them is because we threatened to leave! Management did not even offer us a free round of drinks! Horrible!!!
Fabianes is very popular for breakfast/brunch and rightfully so - the coffee drinks (lattes, cappuccinos and mochas) are so delicious
The baked eggs (especially the crispy prosciutto/cheddar) are excellent and so are the breakfast staples such as waffles, yogurt/fruit and granola
Try the acai w/ granola - a brazilian favorite made from a berry that comes from the Amazon
The lines can get long, but the service is efficient
This place is highly recommended!
For breakfast the place gets very busy and tight
Keep in mind that before 5pm each day you need to go the counter to place your order
No table service before 5pm! Although this should not keep you from going

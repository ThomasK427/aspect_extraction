The sushi is truly wonderful - the best salmon sushi is the 'yaki' - v
slightly seared and the uni is mouthwatering
The neo spicy tuna roll is good, v
good, but not necessarily $17 worth of good
Presentation is wonderful and the sake selection is fabulous
Definitely lived up to my expectations
Prices were a bit high but the dining experience was excellent
Inventive, delicious sushi
Move over Nobu, say goodbye Bond Street
Neo Sushi overpowers them both
Surprisingly, I am shoked they did not get best Japanese restaurant of New York
The food is terrific and service excellent
The best Japanese Fusion Restaurant from the East Coast to the West Coast
Definitely give it a try to impress that first date
Btw
the picture displayed is for Sakura of Japan not Neo Sushi
While the quality of the food is acceptable, they tried to cramp as many people as possible(reservation does not make a difference) and it is way overpriced
The service is poor and they will rush you
For the dollar I paid, I could have gone to Nobu instead and gotten much better value
Neo provides a memorable sushi dining experience
We sampled about 12 different dishes and EACH one was delicious! Each dish has a unique sauce and appealing presentation
The dishes are creative and flavorful
They do not use wasabi or soy sauce in their dishes which enables you to really appreciate the taste/texture of each selection
Josh and his staff are top-rate, professional and hospitable
I WISH we had one in San Francisco
What an amazing experience! As a sushi purist, I was very skeptical of new sushi, but am a total convert
We started with the miso cod, which was arguably better than its excellent counterpart at Nobu
The lightly citrusy yuzu was a perfect addition to the miso
Next, a few selections from the wide array of tempura, and then - sushi that is hands-down better than any I've had in the city
Melt-in-your mouth uni, incredible slightly seared salmon
Wonderful concoctions, beautifully presented
Helpful guidance from an attentive server
I'm a tough critic, and can't help but give top marks to this newcomer
We should leave after we looked at the menu- it is full of misspellings ! But unfortunately we didn't
Bad food, bad service, bad prices -very expensive
It was a Friday raining evening and the restaurant was almost empty, not a good sign
But since we had a reservation, we tried to use our sense of humor and we did need a lot
Don't go, better to eat a slice of pizza somewhere else
i went here to celebrate my birthday with my sister in law and loved the place as soon as we walked through the door, a lovely smell of oranges and cinnamon hits you, a great detail
we were seated immediately and had plate after plate of amazing food brought to us over the space of an hour and a half
we didn't feel rushed or intimidated by the staff and they were pleased to answer all our questions about each dish
not much room for personal space would be my only problem, us brits are used to a lot of space in our restaurants so it was strange bumping arms with the man next to me who didn't seem to impressed! great value overall just 60 pounds for a five course meal with a small box of chocolates given as we left which was a great touch
You must know fine dining if you know what canned food tastes like
UWSdiner has no clue
I have been a customer of this restaurant for years and I only have good things to say about it
The food is amazing, perhaps the best Italian in NY and the people there are what make the experience even better
The owners and waitstaff are courteous each time I go
Don't take my word for it, I've seen Donald Trump, Barbara Streisand, Michael Douglas, and a bunch of other people munching there
Anyone, who knows good food is, not what canned food is, should come
You will have an awesome experience
Our first clue that the food would be terrible should have been that the restaurant was practically empty
Though, the waiter who seated us was very quick to criticize us for not having a reservation, something we found rather amusing
The menu looked very appetizing, as did the specials
20 minutes after trying to order some the specials we were informed that they were actually not available
So, looking at the menu again, we ordered
The lasagna was clearly reheated (though not thoroughly) and tasted like something out of a chef Boyardee can
The pan seared beef tenderloins were flavorless and came with a side of a reheated potato croquette
What added insult to injury were the ridiculous prices
Had the food been even half way decent, then, perhaps, the prices could have been justified
But that was simply not the case
If you enjoy food, go somewhere else
My fiance and I ate here for dinner on a weeknight
Our main dishes were a bit pricey, both chicken, but above average in taste
My first impression of this place when I walked in was that it looked like the dining hall at work or a dining area in a nursing home
There is an overwhelming amount of older people here and the decor is outdated, too simple and spread out, plus no music (even low jazz, classical, italian
)to help the feel of this place
The service is ultra slow, but I think the clientelle enjoy sitting and chatting for hours
The staff was friendly and knowledgable on the food
Overall, I would not go back
If I'm going to get slow service with just above average food I need a little more eye candy in the decor or costumers to get me to sit for that long!
If you are looking for a great neighborhood place this is it
The staff makes you feel comfortable as soon as you desend the stairs and walk through the door
They are gracious and polite
As for the food, this place has the best veal chop parm! The fried calamari is light and fresh
The pasta and tomato basil is better than homemade
Dessert is all made fresh daily in the kitchen
Outragous puddings and tarts highlight the menu
Taramisu is outstanding
Prices are the most reasonable that I've seen in a long time for dining in the City
The food was great
We ordered squid fried rice, pork chop, roasted chicken and fish filet
Everything was delicous
The fried rice was tasty
Will go back!
I used to eat there when I was in school but now I get delivery- they food is fresh the chicken is fantastic and they deliver fast everything is neatly packaged no spills
Great value for the money if you want feel good comfort food
It feels more like a diner than a restaurant but the portions are large and authentic although the menu is confusing and has too many options
This restaurant has an identity crisis; is it Chinese, Peruvian, or Spanish? The Flan and puddings for desert are great deal for under 2 dollars a piece
We decided on Flor on Amsterdam b/c parking is better
Anyway, the food is standard
The Sangria was the best part of the meal
The Pollo al la Brasa was just ok
I've had much better a little further uptown
We spent $35 and weren't all that impressed
If nothing else go for the Sangria and have dinner elsewhere
I order the ropa vieja with sweet plantains and yellow rice every time, mixing all of the flavors together and inevitably leaving Flor de Mayo full and content
Service is speedy, excellent value
I love this place
The food is so delicious so very affordable
I always get the chicken w/ the delicious dipping sauce, the pork chops, yellow rice platinos

the margaritas
The menu is simple but good
Try the mac and cheese
The best thing about this place is the staff
They are very friendly, esp
the owner
They all make you feel right at home
The drinks and the bartenders were cool - and the decor is fun
Stick to drinks and you'll be fine
The food was awful and took forever to arrive - which considering the limited menu, few diners and the fact that we ordered chili, mac cheese and a grill cheese was annoying
The crowd was completely random and bizarre - it got old fast
Don't come a knockn' if the trailer is rockn'
Started off with a few of the house margaritas and finished off with a few of the house margaritas
Between our table shared baskets full of sweet fries and macaroni and cheese
My turkey burger was grilled to perfection and satisfied my manly hunger
Trailer Park practices the art of service with a smile
Our bartender could not have been any better and our waitress was fantastic
Thank you for the great time
My veggie burger and margaritas were delish! Fun atmosphere; nice, friendly service
It's the kind of place you'll go back to again and again
The best sweet potato fries I have ever tasted!! The food is as comforting as the surroundings
What a fun place and the owners show their pride on their sleeves - u would have to come 10 times to be able to notice all the amazing nostalgic pieces on the walls and elsewhere! First date must!!!!
What a cool place! Break out your Daisy Dukes and head to Trailer Park! Drinks were buzzworthy, the waitress was the sweetest, and the food was great
The mac and cheese was the best I have had above the Mason Dixon line
The menu is small but everything is good
We had the best time!
Came here twice in the first three weeks
Definitely a kitschy place, well-done in terms of design and amount of cheap cr*p on the walls (e
g
, Velvis, South of the Border stuff)
Drinks are good, in particular the Fruity Margarita for Two
Pineapple drink is not as good, but comes in a whole pineapple
Food is decent -- sweet potato fries are nice, but there are not enough!
The Scene An in-house DJ may be par for the course on the Lower East Side or Smith Street, but on 105th and Broadway, it makes for destination dining
Carne aims at the area's young families and late-night students
The sleek mid-century decor and hip waitstaff just might keep Columbia scenechasers from hopping the 1 train
The Food The menu features nuevo South American grub
However, stick to hard-to-bungle basics, like the burger
The spinach and warm bacon salad is satisfyingly smoky but drowned in grease
Both the tuna entree and the shell steak arrive doused in pepper, obscuring any subtle flavors
Or just sip a caipirinha at the lively, raised-level bar and pretend you're on the other end of the island
I went to Carne on a date and was very disappointed
We chose a bottle of wine on the recommendation from the waiter and it was great
That was all that was great
Tension filled the air as the chief yelled at a waiter in the middle of the bar while in uniform and drinking
Our food for some reason took an obscene amount of time to cook though we both ordered steaks medium rare which were over cooked
Kids ran around as though we were in McDonald's play land
I was mortified that I had brought someone along for this disastrous journey
I went here right after it opened
The staff didn't even tell us (college kids) about the prix-fixe special, but the pair of older adults sitting next to us took advantage
We could have used it as we were on a budget
The food was just O-K, and the portions were small
I have to admit we still rave about the eggplant
For the life of me, I can't figure out why Carne is so popular
I've been there for a few dinners, and a couple of brunches
The food is mediocre, the ambience doesn't exist, the service is consistently bad, and the steaks? There are many better steaks to be found in NYC
Yet, the place is packed all the time and gets great reviews
To each his own, I suppose, but I say don't believe the hype
Following the comments of a fellow reviewer, I went to Carne yesterday for the early bird prix fixe dinner
Having been to Carne only once before for a decent, but expensive, lunch after the blackout of 2003, I was fairly neutral to the place
However, both my date and I agreed that the prix fixe menu was quite a good deal -- and the food was quite good to boot! The lamb shank was nice and tender, the salmon steak was also tasty
The Vidalia onion rings were quite good, with a very crisp taste and texture
The baby green salad was also quite nice, without too heavy a vinegrette
Overall, quite nice and a great deal for $20 / person!
I was going anyway for an early dinner, and what did I find? A great Prix Fixe menu
Delicious Caesar Salad (hard to find these days), a 20oz bone-in ribeye steak, creamed spinach, and beverage
Mine was $30
You can get it for about $23
Delicious
and the service was just fine
GO!
Try their steaks- they are absolutely delicious
Also mussels and foie gras appetizers are to die for
Great wine list! Brunch is also very nice- chopped salad, french toast or goat cheese omelet are all very tasty
Service can be a bit slow but overall, staff and waiters/tresses are friendly and helpful
In the beginning, the chef at Carne made a heavenly buerre blanc sauce that no one appreciated, hence it was 86'd
Indicated talent at work
Great steaks and perfect fish, A+ wine list
The mediocre spinach salad mislead the City Search reviewer
This is the best restaurant in the area
The food was excellent and the plentiful
Service is variable but mostly good
I was very please with the meal
and the pricing
My husband and I and friends couldn't have had a better dining experience
The waiters were super friendly, the food was right on the mark and the prices were very reasonable
Highly recommend upper West siders to stake their claim on this comfortable and embraceable restaurant
A much needed addition to the paltry selection of restaurants in the area
It's not the best steak place ever, but if you're in the area and you're hungry, it's worth visiting
I love the corn bread they serve at brunch, and the french toast was good the second time I had it
Cocktail selection isn't bad
Service, alas, can be slow but what else is new in NYC?
Four of us seated quickly at 8pm on Thurs
Doorway cold air was evil when 10 degrees, but food quite good though service not snappy
It's about time more good restaurants moved into this area
We need decent places to hang out and people watch too!! Plus, brunch on the weekends is great and rivals the places on Amsterdam, but without the silly wait
Thanks!
A place with great bistro food, soulful music and perfect cocktails open at midnight up here?! This is the place to go if you're up past 11 and need to eat and drink
Friendly staff who are knowledgable about wine by the glass
Steak is done exactly as you ask, without too many frou-frou frills

This is not your typical yuppie fakey post modern restaurants
This is the REAL stuff with REAL people who love to entertain and have a passion for food
The restaurant is in the up and coming neighborhood of Astoria
I have been to them all
Jour et Nuit's food is by far the best of any Moroccan restaurant in the City
Exquisite
sublime
authentic
can't wait to go back! Also, the prices are very reasonable
GOOD NEWS!!Last friday me and 4 of my vodka guzzling foodie buddies decided to go to our new favorite latino/tapas Lounge NOVO and I realized we bought cake to the bakery!!!We had just purchased a bottle of the ol goose and found that we did not need bother
THEY NOW HAVE A FULL LIQUOR BAR with a array of specialties drinks
To make a long story short
WE ROCKED THE PLACE!! the stuff movies are made of great food great place good fun and oh yeah MELON SANGRIAS!!!
I recently visted this slice of paradise on Hudson and found the ceviches to be nothing but blissfull!!I highly recommened their Hamachi Novo ceviche and also their camaron dulce en fuego
Honestly,If you close your eyes while you taste this you can imagine yourself in some remote ceviche bar in a japanese fishing port on the coast of Peru!!Another thing that swept me off my feet was the beutiful layout of the place Like a little Island getaway but not in the vain of some uptown tiki bar,but more like a hidden resort
Definitely a must go if you dig latino cusine and loungy vibe
Gets a little too party for my taste after midnight,but a very cool chic crowd
My girlfriends and I spent an evening at this restaurant to celebrate a birthday
We all had a great time, and spent much of the evening laughing
laughing at the ridiculously small portions! None of us appreciate huge volumes of food, but we do expect to feel somewhat satisfied after a meal
Each tapas is about a 1/2 cup of food
The entrees are not much better
The frustrating thing is that all of the food was delicious, and the service was excellent, but the portions are more appropriate for a 5-year old with a sophisticated palate
Recently I was on Hudson St and I found NOVO which I would have walked by if it was not for the lighted NOVO sighn I was standing on
In talking with the very attractive manager they are byob so I booked my bday party for the following weekend
Me and 10 of my friends came prepared and they made us some of there NOVO sangria and pitcher of liomonadas which made us all very happy(if you know what I mean) and then the feast began we started out with some greta platos clientes which included calmari and chorizo withj fabba beans and then some of the best ceviches I ever had and finished up with latin american pastas and plancha dishes
All and all a great night with supeb service and good music and ambiance not to mention at there prices it felt like we ate for free
This is where you'll find the name of the restaurant
It is stylish, you eat by candlelight, there's wonderful service and delicious food
One important thing to point out is this: Don't come here if you have a monster of an appetite
Unless of course you don't mind ordering quite a few appetizers and entrees to fill you up
The portions seem small compared to the big portions we get elsewhere
They are healthy portions
The restaurant still does not have a liquor license, but it's all good - BYOB
Another thing to point out is the unisex bathroom that can be shared by men and women at one given time
I loved the common room, felt like I was in a western for a second - tasteful, not tacky
pretty disappointing
tortilla espanola with lobster was ok
i enjoy lobster in any form, but the rest was just bland, and if the bite didnt have enough of the beet salad in it, it just wasnt that good
the beet stuff on its own was nice though
it had flavor
the ceviche, ok
nothing particularly special
ive had tapas many times before, and considering the price, the ceviche serving definitely could've been bigger
oxtail pasta
OK
the oxtail itself was great, but the sauce was a little TOO rich for the pasta, though the consistency of the pasta was excellent
croquettes were pretty good
as long as you like ham and german potato salad
which i do
but considering the price, i would probably recommend going to another tapas place
and the free dessert the daily news mentioned? we didn't get any
that being said, service was great
very clean, fresh atmosphere
Had a wonderful experience at Novo
The ambiance is festive, however, not too loud
Servers were extremely attentive, and the food was quite delicious
Although they don't have a liquor license, they were very accomodating to our wine - even making sangria for us! Try it out!
No liquor licence? NO OBJECTIONS HERE YOUR HONOR
I recently had my birthday party here and it was an unapralleled good time
The atmosphere is low key and laid back but lively at the same time
The menu features myriad dishes ranging from ceviches to salads to pasta dishes - and all the portions of deliciously compact and share friendly
If you're on the wagon, let one of the sexy bartenders mix up one of their amazing fruit drinks - drinks that will only be augmented by liquor once they get their licence
In the meantime, bring your own booze, sit back and enjoy the candlelight
Wow! Food and ambiance where perfect! had a open kitchen for all to see
They are waiting for there liquor license but in place of alcohol they have an exciting fruit drink menu
Was told they should have there liquor license in a few weeks
Definatly check it out you can always bring your own bottle
It's kinda in no man's land, but worth the trip west if you're around 9th ave
It's a simple pub with strong drinks, friendly service, and very good food
Their burger ($8 with fries) is AMAZING!! It's got a real charcoal taste like it was cooked on an outdoor grill
Their brunk is also a really good deal!! Bartenders are nice and not annoying
Real solid place!!!
I had the best Italian Sandwich called Piada last week
I happened to find this small, cozy place in LES when I was walking around the area, and it turned out to be a great food experience
On the staffs recommendation
I tried Amarcord, which was the typical piada with prosciutto di parma, mozzarella cheese and Arugla
It was really, really delicious! I was presently surprised
I like the fact that the bread was just made and ingredients are fresh
It is definitely the best deal
I definitely go back to the place and want to try other piadas
If you go to the LES area, go and try this new Italian sandwich
I think its a perfect place to stop for brunch, snack or even dinner!
I took my mother and grandparents who are from korea here and we were very disapointed because the employes were SO rude to us
They did not pay attention and forgot things then one waitress and the girl in charge were fighting in front of the customers
The food was ok but not too special
When they first open it was good price for the amounts of food but now they are getting more cheaper every time
I was embarass to bring my special families there and now I can not go back even for drinking with friends because there service is to terrible here
Best korean bbq on 32nd, by far
The portions are large and the marinade is perfect
What also sets them apart from all the other places is the number of side dishes! The decor is very clean and modern, so it's the perfect place for gatherings of all types
We've taken a number of friends there and it's unanimous, they all agree its the best bbq
The other restaurants around there don't compare
Bite my tongue, Shilla's dishes are as good as Mama's cooking! A discerning taste critic will enjoy their dishes
Shilla produces authentic dishes with clean precision to the palate
Their dishes are not inundated with confusing flavors
The BBQ has a very clean taste, without the beefy taste under the marinade
The appetizers (bahnchans) are varied and plenty
All the ingrediants used are ultra fresh, especially the vegetables
Their Silver Cod dish is notably delicious, sweet spicy

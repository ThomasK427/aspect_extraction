Our waiter was very nice and professional though there were few times where he seemed to be MIA for quite a long time
I would definitely dine here again
I frequented Brasserie 8 1/2 often a couple of years ago, when I worked in mid-town
This last visit, having not been there for a while, left me speechless and in awe
The food was just perfection
The most inventive flavor combinations and textures, and the most incredibly tender short ribs
My wife's salmon just melted in the mouth, likely the best salmon dish we have both ever had
Presentation was unbeatable too
True masterpieces that rival the best of the best in New York
You could see that there was so much thought and consideration that went into the dishes
Probably one of the best meals we've ever had, from start to finish
While the dining room may need some updating, we didn't complain when we sank into those booths after that scrumptious meal
Go for the tasting menu, which at $55 is a gem of a bargain!
I'd been to 8 1/2 at least 3 or 5 times
After my most recent experience, I would NEVER go back
8pm reservation, place was half empty on a Saturday
After ordering and recieving drinks ($17 glasses of wine from a bottle I know retails for $22) the waiter disappeared for literally 15 minutes
We weren't in hurry, but didn't expect to wait so long to be served
A different waiter took our order
Eventually, Food was Good
$35 fillet mignon ordered medium came out well done, the first time
There are too many places in NYC better than this where dinner for 2 is less than $150 to ever go back to Brasserie 8 1/2
Much better even at Brasserie
We went here for restaurant week which is a great time to try an otherwise expensive place
We had the prix fixe menu which was excellent
All the food was carefully prepared and the presentation was a cut above
Portions were a little on the small side, but I was full by the end and definitely satisfied
Interior decor was nice
I would definitely recommend it for restaurant week when the prices allow you to sample some of their great dishes
I recently enjoyed dinner at Brasserie 8 1/2 with my boyfriend
Our entire experience was exceptional
The service, particularly our server Erin, struck a nice balance between attending to our needs and allowing us to enjoy our evening
Erin also recommended a bottle of pinot noir that was well worth the splurge
The food was bold and flavorful and the fish dishes were not weighed down with heavy sauces
The atmosphere was sexy and the space was roomy, allowing for quiet conversation
This restaurant cannot compete with the city's best, but it is certainly very good
I came here for dinner, with a $50 Restaurant Associates birthday certificate
I had the foie gras appetizer
The foie gras itself left a lot to be desired, but the foie gras and beef cheek crispy crepes that came with it were outstanding
The big surprise came when I ordered the seabass and the waiter recommended I get it medium rare
I have never in my life heard of medium rare seabass
I ordered it cooked all the way through and it was outstanding
The Belgian raspberry beer was delicious
I am told the baby pig is very good
The dcor and service are excellent
I will definitely return to this restaurant, but perhaps only with a $50 birthday certificate next year
My friend and I were able to get an 8pm reservation on a Friday night fifteen minutes prior to our seating time
Even though we were running a little bit late, we were promptly seated upon arrival
Our waiter was attentive, but not extremely knowledgeable about the wines on the menu
I did not like the wine that I initially ordered, but I was able to substitute a different one at no extra charge
The food was excellent! The portions aren't especially large, but are quite satisfying after a three course meal
I would definitely go back to Brasserie 8 when I feel like splurging on a meal at a great restaurant
I went on a Saturday night, which wasn't busy at all
I had a $50 Birthday gift certificate that wasn't valid with the $35 pre-fixe menu
The pre-fixe menu looked like a GREAT deal and had menu items not on regular menu
The bill came to $180 for a meal that conisted of, individual first and second courses, a bottle of wine and a shared dessert with two espressos
I got ravioli as a first course and although there were only three, that was all you needed
I hate restaurants that choose quantity of quality
My only mistake was ordering Italian food at a French restaurant
The fish was good also but my date's beef was amazing
And dessert was divine
Stick to what the French do well and you'll get a great meal
A bit pricey for my taste but for those that can afford it
it's worth it
Creative and sleek decor
Food and everything else is just par
Nothing exceptional about it
I like the decor of this restaurant including the glass mural, lovely lounge, and cozy booths
The food is pretty good overall and there are treasures to be found on the menu like the scrumptious gnocchi (the sauce is so good) and the fantastic chocolate box (to share or eat alone, it includes several interesting and delectable chocolate desserts for the price of one)
I went with some friends for Restaurant Week on the recommendation of a friend who has been to 8 1/2 before
The staff was very attentive
Most of us had the price-fix dinner and one of my friends had an item from the regular menu
Food was excellent and while the portions weren't especially large, by the conclusion of the meal through two appetizers, the main course and desert, we were content
The atmosphere is great as well
Both the bar and lounge is a great place to wait for a table or for friends to arrive
With extremely convenient parking and excellent food and atmosphere, I will definately be going back to 8 1/2
I went here with my family for Father's Day and we ordered from the Prix Fixe Menu
The food was simply amazing, and it was obvious that each dish was prepared with skill and care
Try the Herb Crusted Skate, it is unbeliveably good
The restaurant does feel like a hotel lounge at first, partly because it is right in the lobby of an office building, but be assure that it's anything but that
Once you pass the lounge area and sit down, you realize that it is a very high quality establishment, both elegant and classy
Perfect place to go to for an occasion or a quiet evening
The service was phenomenal as our waitress helped us out with each dish and drink selection
All in all, great evening, and I will definitely be going there again soon
Went for the price-fixe lunch, had delicious wine, appetizer, and lamb entree
Service was superb
Atmosphere was pleasant and din't feel crowded at all
Highly recommended!
I went to Brasserie 8 1/2 for their Christmas Night Prix Fixe and had a very disappointing experience
We were not seated at our reservation time of 8:00pm, even though we saw numerous empty tables
The bartender virtually ignored us while we waited, took 15 minutes to get drinks
We were not seated until 25 minutes after our reservation time
Our waiter was inattentive throughout the meal, took nearly 3 hours for dinner
They ran out of 3 of the 5 prix fixe deserts
Overall poor management - poor planning, poor execution, poor service
Food was very good but overshadowed by disappointing experience
The crowd was hip and the stained glass window glimmered through the romantically lit dining room
I wasn't in the mood for a large crowd in the lounge so I went to the lower bar to wait for my friends
Peter, was fantastic with conversation, hospitable and drinks
We were seated our waiter was Oz? He took care of us from guiding us on wine 2 excellent recommendations on the food

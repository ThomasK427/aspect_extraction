I mention this because our taxi driver couldn't find it to save his life and became quite belligerent, nearly throwing us out of his cab because HE couldn't find it
The place wasn't overly busy and service was decent
On 4 different Sunday nights I took 4 different dates there for drinks, and every one of them loved the place! Drinks are creative, the lounge is romantic and the views are inspiring
There were barely any people there, which makes it intimate
The terrace is not huge, but there's noone or almost noone there, so it's romantic enough for kissing
Waiters are attentive and courteous, and not annoying
There was no piano music, though (not sure if it's good or bad though)
Photos on their website don't really represent the place accurately, but it's still really nice!
The view is amazing and having a drink outside before dinner was romantic
However, being a New Yorker and eating in fine restaurants often this is not worth it
Could have been the worst meal my girlfriend and I have had in a NY restuarant
Go for drinks and the view - ONLY!!! Save the bucks for a better meal elsewhere
Not what I expected, AT ALL!!! The restaurant's website boasts an interior and dining experience that is out of this world
I am here to tell you the exact opposite is true
Yes the view is something spectacular, however there are a dozen other restaurants in the city that boast a similar view and have a spectacular menu and cuisine that is enjoyable
On the second night of an anniversary weekend with my wife we went to Top of the Tower
What I thought would be a memorable experience turned out to be exactly that, but for all the wrong reasons
Trust me, the wait staff is rude and inattentive and the food leaves something to be desired
If all you care about is a view of the city, then go here, otherwise steer clear!
When I looked that the resturant website, the picture made the resturant look more impressive that it acutually was
Despite that, the atmostphere was nice, it is very romantic at night but so-so during the day
The food was excellent, i would definately recomend the strip steak
It's a nice place to go but probably not somewhere i would go to again
I was taken here for my birthday and had a fabulous time
We first dined in the wrap around dining area with a view of the city
The food was excellent and the service matched
You could hear the piano in the main room playing classics
Although we truly enjoyed the view of the city for the couple hours we dined
we felt there was no need to leave for another bar
so after dinner we stepped into the internal bar area with the piano player to enjoy after dinner drinks
This room had an art-deco style which really played off the music
My date's choice of Top of the Tower was perfect for my first birthday spent with him
I'll always remember that evening as special
Service on a Saturday nigh was prompt; waiters and other food-related attendants were courteous/attentive but other personnel were extremly rude
I strongly recommend the NY-Steak with the Surrey Martini and NY-Cheesecake
The dimly lit mid-section: pianist and bar along with the spectacular view set the perfect romantic spark
Excellent restaurant and one I would recomend to visitors to the city
The atmosphere is romantic and the service excellent!
Don't let the website pictures fool you
The place is actually much smaller that the pictures make it seem
But rest assure, the food was great, help was funny,polite and always fast
Great place for romantics
Dark, and lit only by the candles on your tables
Great view!
The Scene Exposed brick walls crossed with sturdy wood beams set a cozy, rustic tone in the smallish front room--out back, there's a lighter garden area
The restaurant is surprisingly busy, given the slightly obscure location, with the odd U
N
diplomat sprinkled among the mostly neighborhood crowd
Service is informative and quietly attentive
The Food This was New York's first Basque restaurant, and the solid, unadventurous food is pitched very close to mainstream Spanish cuisine
It's best sampled via the lengthy tapas menu--lamb, for example, is tasty and succulent in the form of chuletitas tapas, but rather heavy as a main course
Elsewhere, there's Serrano ham, soft red piquillo peppers stuffed with cod and juicy chorizos
My first visit here definitely impressed
Everything that we tasted on the menu was great, particularly the shrimp tapas (if you don't order it yourself, the waiter will surely recommend it)
Trust the staff on the wine selection - the bottle's are a bit pricey but definitely worth it
Basque food may work in all seasons, but wait for warm weather before going to Marichu - the heating's atrocious and the place literally freezes everytime someone goes in or out
Thanks a lot, Miguel, for making us feel like if we were back in Basque Country! Great Basque restaurant (we know what we are talking about
we are Basque people), but above all, GREAT service! We will come back every time we go to New York and of course, we will tell everybody about it! Eskerrik asko denorik!!!
A Spanish restaurant where the waiters don't speak Spanish? That's not what I call authentic
The ambiance in this tiny restaurant is cozyand the wine list great
We were not impressed by the food and, being from Spain, highly question its authenticity
It's a nice place, but there's better
I don't think I have been anywhere else other than Bask country itself that serves food this authentic (and good)
Everyone should check it out, and definitely try the regional delicacy, chipirones
In addition the waiter suggested a great wine (since we didn't know much about Spanish wines) and all of the service was great
Oh, and try and sit out back if you can
I did the all you can eat Shabu shabu for 25 dollars per person the other day for someone's birthday
Don't be fooled! First of all, we made a reservation for 14 people but only 12 of us showed up
They still charged for 14 people which could be sort of understadable in other restaurants
But shabu shabu doesn't require much preparatoin!!!  Second of all, the quality of meat they served was less than acceptable
Yes, all you can eat for 25 bucks is cheap
We weren't expecting things like LAN in east village
But still, it was discusting but we had to finish a mound of bad meat before we get to the second round of plates
Finally, it wound up being 60 dollars each in the end!!!
(how??)  To give some credit to Naniwa, it is nice to get the private room upstairs
It's very Japanese
(i'm japanese) and relaxing
A great place for an authentic Japanese meal
Try the daily lunch special which is great value or book a Tatami room and transport yourself to the Far East with a group of friends
Top quality food and service
I had my birthday party thrown here this past weekend, and I would have to say this is the worst restaurant in New York City
It's an authentic Japanese restaurant without service and food
We had only one waitress taking care of my 24 guests
Only a half of our orders came through, which left my guests scrambling for food at fast food joints afterwards
What a disappointment
What is one supposed to say about a Japanese restaurant that serves fugu, the poisonous blowfish? If prepared incorrectly, you'll die eating it
I'd say this place is pretty authentic
I'd have rated it higher if the prices were about 10% less
They do have a summer special that is pretty good, especially if you drink
I forgot my credit card and the hostess chased me into the street with it
I was also greeted about 10 times
There's a bevy of Japanese restaurants in this area; no single one is a clear winner
great little japanese place hidden on 46th street
fantastic sushi bar, plus a really cool front bar
I went with a large group of friends and we had a wonderful time
We ordered a large amount of food and we're plenty full because of their large portions
The wait staff and matre d' were extremely helpful
If you find yourself in the area and hungry, there isn't a better restaurant
Just had lunch there today with a client, and was wowed by what you get on the $20 lunch menu -- choice of appetizer, entree, and fruit for dessert
And this wasn't your takey-outey fare; instead it was perfectly seasoned (he asked that the spice be taken out of a spicy dish and they obliged), and allover expertly prepared

Steamed in banana leaves with coriander and other spices salmon was excellent and a huge piece
Chicken saag was also very good and a nice portion
Shrimp in a coconut sauce was delicious and a good sized potion
Cornish hen was said to be very good too
Apps were veg pakora, aloo tikyas and shrimp (I forget the prep) were all excellent and arrived at the table within 10 minutes of ordering
Onion kulcha and tandoori roti were both amongst the best Ive ever had
But as I said, at $220 for 4, I feel it was a bit overpriced
Dawat is one of the finer dining experiences I have had in a long time
The food and service are both top-notch
I don't think there's much more to say than that
Everytime I have been to Dawat the food has been superb
The chef's specialties are just that and I recommend ordering them
The Chicken Tikka Masala is delicious and so are the scallops
The service is also outstanding! I have been to a lot of Indian restaurants and this one ranks in my top three
The combination of the service and the food and the courteous waiters make this whole experience a must for Indian food lovers
I dined at Dawat a couple of weeks ago, and I thought the wait staff was very professional
It is an over-priced restaurant, but you pay for the excellent service and food
I felt like I was in Bombay's highend restaurant again
The food is exceptional and very tasty and even though they do take-out, it is quite an experience to dine-in! A must-do and very reasonable
Eating at Dawat has is always a treat to the senses
It is an elegant restaurant and never disappoints in serving up flavorful indian specialties that you will not find anywhere else
The portions are huge for a restaurant in this price range
For the meat eaters out there, try the lambchops or the Raan
Just writing this makes me hungry!
I have good memories of the bibim bop from this take out lunch spot but my recent visit was a disappointment
I got a sandwich with stale hard bread and was charged almost $9
00
Not at all worth it
They also seem to have very fast turnaround with the food which makes me think that they don't make anything as fresh as they used
Good quality, unqiue (but limited) menu, great value
Try the Meatloaf Platter or the Vegetable Rice Bowl
I discovered Spoons last year as a dinner take-out option and I am so glad I did! The service is always prompt and the food is excellent
Although there is no seating space, this is the type of food you would want to be able to enjoy at home anyway
Really high-quality gourmet stuff, with some asian and carribean flair
I highly recommend the Pop's Chicken but everything is good
Order before everyone else discovers it!
I love the mac 'n cheese and other rice-based bowls
A simple menu with a nice asian staff running the place
Limited choices though
Not very expensive
Take out only - nowhere to sit - save for a few UNCOMFORTABLE stools
Bad points? No real breakfast menu to speak of, and when I ordered an espresso-based drink they had no vanilla syrup and the dusty old bottle of almond syrup they did have looked ancient
I skipped it
We were being taken out to lunch and were looking to go to a nicer yet modestly priced place near the office
Someone recommended La Giocanda
The food was really excellent
I can especially recommend the pasta with Italian sausage
I don't know that I would go out of my way to go back (I'm also not a huge fan of Italian food), but if you're looking for great food at very reasonable prices with a pleasant ambience and good service, then I would highly recommend it
Food was alright
but the service was horrible
1 rude waiter for the entire restaurant
I have never been reprimanded by anyone whose livelihood depends on tips! There are so may better restaurants in New York City, so stay clear of La Giaconda
Worth a trip from another part of town, they treat you so nicely here
The grill calamari are a delicious appetizer and the filet mignon with the potatoes seasoned just right and a delicious gravy sauce! If you want to eat lighter all the fish is fresh and tasty
If you want to Splurge on dessert the chocolate crepes is the way to go! Great atmosphere, small, soft lighting, warm decor and friendly service
Can't go wrong!
La Gioconda is a great find! This small, quaint, restaurant is great for 2 - 4 people looking for a quiet atmosphere, reasonable prices, and good food
I have been here 3 times now, the pasta is fabulous with good size portions, the service is very friendly, although at times slow
Great place to bring a date, girlfriend or a small group, I loved the penne with sausage and the orchietta with sausage! The grilled calamari is great too!!
Food was great
However, miniscule does not even do this justice
Very loud and cramped
Not good for converstaion and staff was a little upset I didn't buy there overpriced wine
best italian food around for the price
classic italian specialties some with a flare or a little fancier, are served at this romantic midtown italian by the lovliest servers around
Great place for that date after work
La Gioconda is WONDERFUL
I had the broiled snapperREALLY TASTYwith lots of garlic olives
My girlfriend had the fettuccini alla bolognese, fresh pasta with a very rich exquisite meat sauce - big portion (not like most places)
The service was friendly quite attentive
They have a very broad wine selectionwho ever made their list has very good taste! We ended our dinner with the most amazing cappuccinos!! Great prices, intimate dining, authentic Italian cuisine
We will definitely dine at La Gioconda again!!
Spectacular food
my broiled red snapper was fabulous
Complimentary bruschetta was excellent as well
The place is small, 6 or 7 tables, and is not the place if you are looking for a bustling scene with waiters running all over the place, but a great spot for a quiet, relaxing and inexpensive dinner
If you are looking to have dinner as fast as possible, then this is the place for you
However, I went here for dinner with my family on a weekday evening when the place was not crowded, and I felt so rushed that it was not pleasant! The servers were very nice and attentive, but it was just too fast! Also, the sushi was mediocre
The spicy tuna and eal rolls were quite tasty, but the salmon, tuna, and yellowtail were virtually tasteless! Plus, the piece of mackerel I ordered had to have been the worst I have ever had! It was salty, dried out, and chewy! On another note, my mom enjoyed her sushi (but she ordered the two things I said were good)
So if you're lucky with your order and like being rushed, this place may be for you
The Scene Shun Lee Palace is popular with midtown locals, possibly because the upscale room means you can impress a client and have Chinese for lunch at the same time
The decor features an effective mix of Asian and modern art, and service is so attentive that it verges on fawning
The Food An appealing blend of elegance and flavor: Even basics such as wonton soup are complex and flavorful
The rich and generously-portioned hacked chicken and the tender, meaty duckling with ginger are both particularly good
A "spa menu" means that even dieters can find something they're willing to eat
Prices reflect the opulence of the room and service
This place was so-so for me
The food was nithing spectacular and I truly felt as if I were paying not for the food but for the decor which is beautiful
Where else would you go for dinner on Christmas? Shun Lee has been serving creative Chinese food in a deluxe dining room for 30 years--they must be doing something right! The experience was heightened by attentive waitstaff in formal uniforms, authentic ivory chopsticks, real silverware replaced often, artfully carved vegetables and fruits in animal and bird shapes, a gregarious and happy mixed group of diners from shopping moms with polite children to beaming lovers at corner tables
Food also impresses (especially Peking duck and, believe it or not, their Tiramisu dessert!)
Our experience was nothing impressive
The food was generally good but not great
You can find better for less money
The portion sizes were too small (4 bite-sized, chewy shrimp for 16 dollars)
The service wasn't terrible, but wasn't very good either
After eating, we sat for 20-30 minutes without a single waiter coming to us
Some are impressed with the presentation of the food, but it too was common
After the meal, we received 3 cheap fortune cookies, with the plastic wrappers still on
a classy thing indeed
As a finishing touch, the one bathroom stall was occupied for too long by an employee

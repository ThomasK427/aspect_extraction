my friends dishes were mediocre the rabbit tasted like chicken, the steak was almost cold, and the pasta overly salty
bill came to $31pp (no dessert we had been there too long already) which was reasonable
We went on Saturday night and had an awful experience
The restaurant itself is attractive and we were seated promptly but from there it all went downhill
It took 20-30 minutes before we were able to order
Then another hour and a half before our appetizers came
Those appetizers only appeared after we complained to the manager
Everyone was very polite but no once was there a sorry and/or explanation
We actually left before they were able to bring out our main course as we had been there for over two hours
What brief glimpses of food we tried and saw were mediocre at best
Certainly not worth the price
The ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasant, I just wish the food complemented it
First, the service is very flaky
I was never sure who our waiter was, as we were helped by at least four different people
We had to flag down one of these people when we were ready to order and also when we wanted our wine refilled (which they were chilling elsewhere), as they never came around to check on us
The food was uninspired (I had the mixed green salad and the roasted cod), but the dessert was excellent (brown sugar cake)
Craftbar is dubbed Craft Lite, but I would recommend paying more for the real thing
That is, assuming Craft proper is any better
While the new space is not as cozy, the layout is spacious and tables are set comfortably apart
The service was excellent - perfectly attentive without being obtrusive
Waterglasses and wineglasses were always magically full, and the pacing of the meal was excellent
I did find the food to be a little too oily
After reading so many reviews, we ordered the pecorino fondue to share, and it was nothing more than an oily, over-sweetened lump of cheese in a bowl
The skate wing was decent, but again, overpowered by oil/butter
Deserts were excellent, great tea selection, and the wine list was very good as well
I blame my experience on my own mistake - not being more adventurous
So many of the other appetizers/daily specials seemed interesting, with great fresh ingredients
I'd probably go back, just to try some of the other items on the menu
very good meal at craftbar
we had the rabbit and the hareloom tomato and tuna salad
the salad was so refreshing and beautiful and most importantly tasted great
the rabbit was also very good but too big
it was really hot in the restaurant
the waiter said the air conditioner was not working so we ate in a hurry and left but had a good time
we miss the look of the old place
With all the place to eat in the city, don't waste your time here
It's a regular salt-fest
The only thing not laden with sodium was the bread pudding (which was really good)
The service was lacking
we had to get the host's attention just to get a menu and a waitress
The paper on the tables make a pleasant dining experience seem cheap
Bottom line
pass this one up!
Depending on your tastes, this is a fine restaurant with excellent food, but for me, the atmosphere cheap and garish
Definitely, it is not the smaller version fo Craft
Craftbar has moved to a more spacious location, and doesn't miss a beat
The menu has been expanded and the service is familiar and attentive
The pecorino fondue to start has it all-a little salt, spice, and sweetness to accompany the delicious cheese
The hearts of palm salad and frog leg pot au feu to start were incredible
The black sea bass with braised white asparagus was amazing as was the roasted sirloin served with a delicious morsel of braised shortrib
Desserts were great
We recommend the carrot cake made with thumbelina carrots and funnel fritters
And, now we can make reservations
Thanks!
I've eaten at craftbar twice since they've relocated - the space is a little different than the former cosy spot - but it seems they are really growing in to their new environment - the staff was attentive and informative
We enjoyed the sweetbreads and the pecorino fondue - and an amazing chicken liver and foie gras pate with pistachio vinagerette and apple butter - amazing
Then we moved on to our entrees - my favorite is the striped bass with taro puree and black trumpet mushrooms - it all was so delicious, really a great meal
a fantastic banana and chocolate dessert was really good - as is the milk chocolate and coconut semifreddo with dulce de leche
we had a great night!
This place stinks
They got rid of the meatballs and pressed sandwiches
The pasta portions have been halved because the idiots decided to expand and now they have more rent to pay
Why do people mess with a good thing
Now the place is enormous and cold, the staff are bored
The carrot cake desert is essentially a carrot muffin with ice cream on top
Please if you are going to call it a cake at least make the damn muffin dense like a cake and not like a muffin
The only think it has going for it are the bathroom, but the old ones were much better
All in all take a pass at the prices and choices maybe they will switch back to the old menu and increase the portions otherwise stay AWAY!
When we went to dinner here, the place was empty, which should have been a clue
Service was fine, the food was so-so, the table wobbled and the wine was lousy
I chose this place for its Citysearch Notable Wine List and was truly disappointed
We ordered the Mdoc, and it was served HOT
I grant it was a hot day, but they did nothing to protect their wine
Whether it was the heat or the sommelier, this half bottle was undrinkable
We sent it back and ordered the Grand Cru Bordeaux, which was, again, served warm
I'm talking between 75 and 80 degrees
At least it wasn't totally spoiled like the Mdoc
The food was so-so, and the only redeeming thing about the service was that we were charged only for the Mdoc, and not the more expensive Bordeaux
my husband, and a few of our friends and i went out to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago and had the best experience! i had heard a little about Partage, but i would have never expected it to be so beautiful! our server was kind and informative
he was very helpful in suggesting a wonderful tasting tree of mini appetizers to share, and the seabass was phenominal
i would recommend this to anyone! unparalleled service and food! 10 out of 10
Poor, rude service, bad management, below par food, unsatisfying portions, too dark, too crowded, overpriced, bad drinks - there's nothing I can recommend about this place
I wouldn't return if it were the last restaurant in New York!
This past Thursday, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised to find Partage on 7th Avenue
We were looking for a moderate priced, cool place to eat with a large variety of dishes and found it in Partage
We were immediately seated and placed our order shortly after
The food was prompt and more delicious than some of the finer restaurants I've been to in NYC
Most of all we enjoyed the ambiance; it was a mix of low key casual and relaxed party
All in all, it was a great night
They treated us like kings and offered us champagne cocktails on the house
We'll be back
My Girlfriend and I came 15 minutes early they seated us at the bar
Cocktails were delicious, good time, however they forgot about us
10 minutes after our reservation I had to tell the clueless hostess  Wine was garbage
Bought the $38 Pinot Noir, LaBuxynoise 04 we had to order another one
They didn't even offer to comp anything!!!  Meal was acceptable, Lamb was tough although rare like I asked, green beans were overcooked, my girlfriend ordered steak frites rare, came medium, steak was tough, lots of nerves,steak au poivre sauce was mediocre
Fries were good
Inexperienced waitress forgot to get us water, kept overfilling the glasses with wine, end of the meal our waitress abandoned us, we waited 30 minutes to get our check and I had to tap the bartender on the shoulder because he was too busy djing
We will never go there again
After having read the rave reviews and an excellent time at the sister location Paradou, I thought that this would make an excellent choice for a nice dinner on a special occation

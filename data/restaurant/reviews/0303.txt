Unfortunately the next few times I went with my boyfriend our meal wasn't all that great
The guacamole was terrible, and the steak dish was too salty
And our bill of $70 (without drinks) was definitely not worth it
Too bad because it was a great option for dining in the village
BEWARE if you decide to change something in your dish like a different mole sauce you will be charged extra
Went on a busy Fri nite and waited to be seated for 20 minutes or so
Other than that I have nothing but positive things to say
The food is tasty and served quickly
The service is prompt and professional
Our table happened to be near the liquor cabinet and when the owner needed to access the cabinet during our meal - which was hardly a major inconvenience - she removed the pitcher of Sangria we were drinking from our bill
An excellent alternative to your usual burrito and fajita Mexican place
A small side of rice was $4 and a side of beans was also $4
Have chips and salsa at the bar
The same chips at your table and you'll be paying $5 for them (a NY mexican restaurant custom, it seems)
Our waitress explained, we charge for them because we make the chips and salsa here at the restaurant
The entrees are expensive enough
Don't nickel-and-dime the customer over the chips
Being from Texas and constantly in search of good Mexican food, I have finally found it at La Palapa! The margaritas, especially the frozen pomegranate, are huge and delicious
The chips are dusted with a mild chili powder and pair with the guacamole spectacularly
I have had the mole enchiladas 3 times and have to say that they are just as good as back home--sorry, Grandma! The green chicken enchiladas are mouth watering, as well
I am so glad La Palapa exists and highly recommend it
One of the better authentic Mexican restaurants around
You get a great value for a great meal
Can't go wrong
I have to disagree with that last rating
I dined at La Palapa on Sunday night
I had the enchiladas in red mole
not only were they awesome
the serving was gigantic and the mole sauce was rich, thick and tasty
my mouth is watering just thinking of them
they are worth every penny! I also recently dined at Dos Caminos
where the enchiladas were 16
95
you get rice and beans but I would rather have La Palapas Enchiladas anyday!! Hands Down!!
asked my waitress after I placed my order
Of course, she didn't tell me I was going to get charged $3
95 for it
I had the Enchiladas de Pollo Verde, which was good, but not exactly worth $11
95
The chicken was a little dry
They didn't even have the decency to include rice and beans
Too bad
The atmosphere was wonderful, with its Mayan artwork, romantic lighting, and music that's not too loud or soft
The service was warm and friendly
Better to just go for drinks
This place is strong
I find that Mexican food in the city is generally pretty weak, but I'll go here and be happy
Terrific Verdes sauce and nice margaritas
Service is a little naive, but pleasant enough
The seating is a little odd(I've been there several times and sat in differen sections, but always feel squeezed in and a little in the way
Amazing food, friendly service and a spacious dining area
(no bumping elbows and spilling your Tecate!) A great selection of Mexican beers and tequilas, not to mention margaritas in every flavor imaginable, accompany the mouth watering dishes
I am surprised to see negative comments! I went for dinner this weekend and had a delcious meal
The food was great- not your basic taco/burrito Mexican
The dishes are really interesting and very flavorful
Large portions too! I have been before and have a similar experience
Prices are also very reasonable
My favorite Mexican in NYC!
Ate there the other night as part of a party of 10
The service was attentive, the atmosphere fun with interesting Mexican-ish decore, and the food was decent
Good margaritas, although I had around 6 and was still standing
We went for a birthday and there just happened to be 2 others in the same evening there
The foode was delicious, however, portions are small and prices high
It also seemed as though the waiter was just tolerating us and completely ignored some of our requests
This place definately deserves to be on the best Mexican list (if not the best)
Everytime I've been to La Palapa (10 times) the food and drinks have been fantasic and the service impeccable
I don't know what they'er doning to get it so right but it's working
And what a margarita!! I'm so happy I live right around the corner from this joint ,I'm trying to become a regular at the bar, but I keep sitting at a table to enjoy the food
The food is amazing, the service is prompt and friendly and the ambience keeps me coming back
and the drinks are superb!
My first experience at La Palapa was disastrous
My blind date was ugly (not restaurant's fault), the beer was warm, and the food was so spicy it numbed my taste buds
However, I loved the ambience, and decided to give it another chance
I'm glad I did so, because all my gripes seemed to have been addressed
I've since been there many more times, and I would probably rate this restaurant as one of the top three Mexicans in the city
To top it all off, getting a table there is never a hassle
La Palapa makes Burritoville look like Daniel! Here are a few reasons: 1) The margaritas are overpriced, unpleasantly sour and weak
2) When not otherwise unacceptable - blandness, dryness, etc
- the dishes are generally one-note disasters with the singular note being hotness
2) The sauces they leave on the table are the same sauces they dump on the food, one of which rendered the enchiladas - which don't earn a positive numerical rating to begin with - bitter, overhot and totally inedible
3) After biting into a piece of duck, I had to look at the menu again to see if I had, in fact, ordered the duck jerky special
4) In general, there is a lack of fundamental skills in the kitchen
culinary sins abound here, folks! La Palapa is a primer for how not to prepare Mexican food
'Nuff said
If you are looking for refried beans, go elsewhere
This is modern regional Mexican cuisine
I have been to La Palapa several times with friends and each plate is always excellent
I don't know what other restaurant these folks are complaining about
I've had to push my plate away due to the large portions (the enchiladas are gigantic)
Although, I have to admit that the mixed drinks are awful, stick with beer and wine
Having ordered delivery from here, I decided to go and try out the restaurant with six friends
We ordered apps and main courses
3 apps came 10 minutes into being there, the other 3 came 45 minutes later NO JOKE!
then 5 minutes later they brought out all the entrees
don't know about you--but mexican food is type of meal i need time in between courses
having a full plate of appetizers when the entrees were brought out did not allow me to enjoy my food at all
The waiters were rude, the place was empty (thus no justification for this type of service), and we were treated horribly
Guess that automatic 20% tip on parties of 6 really hinders their desire to give good service
Though the food was good, it is very pricey, and the service is awful
I will NEVER return (nor get takeout) again

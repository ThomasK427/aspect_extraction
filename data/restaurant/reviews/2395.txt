The food delicious
The new renovation is true to its original decor
Overall, well worth the experience

Take it for what it is, an old bar that has great burgers and beer
and now some awesome shellfish
I came here Saturday for dinner with four picky foodies and we were all unanimous in thinking the burgers were better than Corner Bistro and although smaller than Jackson Hole, the quality of the meat was better
The oysters were as fresh as can be and the onion strings a perfect match with any burger
Get a beer and a burger and stop expecting Le Crique, it's not, and never will be
If you don't like it, trot over to Outback Steakhouse next door and leave room for folks who aren't so inaccurately judgmental
Over a year to renovate, but what? The alleged famous burgers are adequate at best, and are too small
way too small
The novelty will wear off at some point, hopefully the owners, including washed-up actor Timothy Hutton will wise up
Are you kidding me with these wimpy reviews? I waited paitently for the renovation to be done
Is the burger the best in the city? No
Is the service the best in the city? No
But they are damn good
Is the experience of getting a burger and a beer at Clarke's after work the best in the city? ABSOLUTELY!!!
The renovation has managed to maintain the same appealing old New York feeling at Clarke's
The burgers are still excellent, the veal parmesan rivals any in the city, and the raw bar upfront was a great, if somewhat unfaithful, addition
Great to have it back
Welcome back to a great institution
The new owners spared no expense in bringing this landmark back and beyond its former glory
I strongly recommend everyone to check this out
We had a pleasant dinner on a Saturday night at the Leopard
The restaurant had all you can drink wine with the prix fix menu, always a good touch:-) For the price I can't complain about the wine too much
The prix fix menu has the same choices as a la cart
Although the portions seemed a little diminutive at first, they turned out to be the perfect size once the dinner was over
The wait staff were professional and attentive, but they seemed somewhat sad
I got the feeling that the restaurant was not doing too well
Maybe it's the recession
Pretty much all the clientele were over their 60's
The place looked very old, but had a sort of charm to it
I would go back again
I live in Chicago but I must visit the Leopard every time I go to NY
For the price it is one of the best meal values in NY
The service is always superb and the menu varies
The wines are provided so don't expect greatness
I tell my friends that this is a romantic, old world restaurant that is a wonderful getaway from touristy pricey NY restaurants
Go there you will not be disappointed
And tell Vincent his friend, Jim, from Chicago sent you
Just a classic old skool romantic restaurant
The service is top notch and the decor makes you feel as if the world has never changed
Great after work bar--excellent pints of Guinness and friendly bartenders
Try it!
a third avenue standout ideal for several cold pints after work
if you want simple, go to the stand
the bartender, don, is also a local favorite
have never tried the food but during happy hour the owners bring out appetizers and gags- so that is probably the best time to stop in
I have dined at Cinquanta many times, and never been disappointed
The food is very good and the service is exquisite
All of the staff is attentive and friendly
The hostess is particularly kind and friendly, and ensures that all of her customers are well taken care of
The restaurant would not be the same without her
The house wines are acceptable, but the better bottles serve as a more appropriate accompaniment to the excellent food
The prices are very reasonable for midtown Manhattan, and this restaurant is one that should not be missed
Have been to this restaurant several times, Food usually is good and service is excellent we went this past wk end and food was bland
Ceaser salad my husband had was a little wilted
I had mussels- they were OK and the salmon w
mustard sauce- it was tasty however the mashed pot
w it was very tasteless
the sliced steak my husband had was good but I thought 26
00 for Sliced steak was more then the whole steaks
This is one of New Yorks best kept secrets for Italian food in a romantic setting! Their hostess and waiters were among the most friendly I have incountered, the food was outstanding from appetizers to desert
It is one of the few resturants left that actually cook old world style
I would highly recommend this resturant to anyone looking to enjoy a great meal without breaking your wallet all in a very romantic setting with one of the best menus in the city
The food was good to OK compared to many other Italian restaurants I ate in
The staff was unfriendly and unpleasant to deal with
At the end of the meal, a miscommunication occurred and the staff members that dealt with that were extremely rude, unprofessional and obnoxious
I would strongly recommend to avoid it
Not being a native New Yorker, I couldn't say how Cinquanta measures up to the multitude of other Italian restaurants in the city
It's hard to imagine many of them surpassing Cinquanta's service, however
The wait staff was extremely attentive , even more importantly, very helpful
The menu was quite large the specials numerous
The food could be a tad less salty the coffee a tad stronger but, all told, few complaints here
The hostess was loud and quite annoying when she yelled for a waiter in the middle of the restaurant
The appetizers were good but the main course was not tasty at all
for anyone in our group
The waiter was nice but the food was below average
I found this restaurant on this website and I was not disappointed; the food is exceptional, casual attire is okay, with an attentive wait staff, and you don't choke when you get the bill! I highly recommend it
This place has absolutely the best true Italian food in this country
The service is absolutely to die for
I truly feel like I'm in Italy when I'm here
Perfecto!
I planned a large formal event at La Maganette for a 5 course wait service and attended another with buffet both in Spring 2004
The ambience is beautiful, and the manager was so great to work with
I preferred the wait service food over the buffet
There is also a dance floor and a podium
Also, 5 courses (appetizer, salad, pasta, main, desert) for $30 (plus tax and gratuity)? You can't beat that deal!
Wow, Paid 9
50 bux during normal Happy Hour times for a drink!!!
The food was god awful
You are far better off buying pasta and sauce at the local deli and cooking it yourself
Even more unbelievable that they charge average $15 a plate for something that tastes like cafeteria food
New york city is full of good italian restaurants, don't bother with this one
This place has great food and a after work happy hour scene
I noticed none of the other reviews mentioned the parties that go on inside the restaurant downstairs
10 bucks gets you inside and a small buffet dinner
After you eat the party begins, I'll admit that in the beginning it was kinda slow but then out of no where the party exploded and there was standing room only! Lucky for me and my group we had a table right by the dance floor

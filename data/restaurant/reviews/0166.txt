The appetizers were Foie Gras, Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, and house made pate
Plowing through those apps my tastebuds where awakened
Allowed us time to relax
Unexpectedly 6 small portions of seared scallops with fresh wasabi arrived and we were told compliments of the chef
WOW! Our food Venaison, Dover Sole, Cote De Bouef, Seared Tuna, Steak Au Poivre, and Artic Char
I had a fantastic experience ! If you want orgasmic food,knowledgeable service this is the place to go!
This feels like a fancy hotel lobby restaurant
we did family gathering for brunch - food selection was ok ok tasting
the lox, artichoke hearts mesculen salad were good
but the roast beef was not tender or tasty, the hot food station was ok for omelets, desserts/fresh fruits disappointing
they accomodated our 2 toddlers were at least patient with us (wasn't so crowded)
nice waiting area restrooms
pretty crowd
SUM IT: if you need a brunch place, find another spot
I took my out-of-town sister to this restaurant expecting to enjoy a wonderful dinner in classy ambiance
Right off the bat, our experience was doomed
Even though we were there for an early dinner (the dining room was no where near full), the hostess immediately seated us at the worst table in the house
After I inquired about their famous lobster special and its availability, the waiter disregarded out of hand
When asked to recommend a drink, he replied I don't know anything about cocktails
So much for a shee-shee restaurant with excellent service!!! Please do not waste your hard-earned money by going here
Go someplace else
The food was okay, but certainly not worth all the hassle you have to go through to get it
I came on July on a night that I thought was a $ 20 Summer prix fixe dinner
The waitress told me it was $30 but when she brought over the manager to speak to me, he honored my word
But when I checked my email at home, the special was for Mon and Tues only
We ate on a Thurs
What the manager did for us was exceptional
This place really respects the customers and treats them like gems
The food was phenomenal and the ambience is unbeatable
I definitely recommend!
I was there during NY restaurant week
This is by far the best restaurant for the week
I tried Mesa Grill, Bolo and Tao
Mesa and Bolo both have good food but bad hostess
Brasserie 8 1/2 is the best among these
I'd heard so much hype about this place that didn't really live up to expectations
The grand staircase showed signs of age, the lounge crowd was semi-trendy, but the rest of it was creepy looking guys staring at every girl who walked past
The quality of food varied, but props for imaginative desserts
Our waiter was incredibly patient and helpful, and despite the influx of noisy young squealing girls taking advantage of the restaurant week deals, it was a pleasant experience
Last night I was there to celebrate my birthday with my family
There were four us, for which, I used my Dine Out NY coupon
Not only was the staff and manager very accomodating but when my mother was curious to see the kitchen, which can be partly seen in the back of the dinning room, the manager/maitre d was more than willing to show the kitchen
(Very clean!) But really it's the food that stole the show
Fantastic! The booths were very comfortable and great for convesation and the staff was very gracious and helpful
Although the eservation was for 6 PM we were not rushed at all to our table
All in all a wonderful evening
The open bara area and lounge is great for drinks and to talk
The seating area is spacious and allows you to enjoy your dinner
I had a special Talapia stiff w/ crabmeat with a whote trufle sauce
It was OK, but not great
The chocolate dessert was great though
The ambiance was nice and the food so so
I would come back if the price was right
Excellent food that is not overpriced in NYC is hard to find
Brasserie 8 1/2 serves up excellent food, good service and the price is not like dining at the Cipriani
For those of us who still need to do business here it's a great find
The other INCREDIBLE value is the Sunday Brunch
You cannot eat 5 star foods like this in New York for $25 with a glass of champagne
I put it on my recommended list; I can't wait to try the roasted pork
I go to the lower bar at 8 1/2 often, but have to rethink this as the new bartender on Thursday nights is very rude
I overheared him call us euro white trash bitches on our way out because we left him only a 15% tip
This was after he served our 2nd round of drinks into the same glasses as the first (I wouldn't even expect this in a dive bar, let alone a place where you pay $10 for a drink), he had no idea about the food when asked, and was so slow and frazzeled, it looked like it was his first night behind a bar
They used to have a lovely guy behind the bar - where did he go???
perhaps it was the fact that we were there for the restaurant week deal
perhaps our party was too melanin heavy - who knows
but upon arrival, we were looked up down, walked past several empty tables and promptly seated at table 21 - in front of the door to the kitchen, with waiters passing us every 2 seconds, kitchen noise, and a draft that made me wish i hadn't checked my coat
2 of my friends were hit in the head w/ elbows by the wait staff!! i won't be returning there, that's for sure
the food was good and our waitress was sympathetic to our plight - but Brasserie 8 1/2 left a bad taste in my mouth
the lounge area at brasserie 81/2 is awesome!! great atmoshere, cozy couches and fantastic drinks
by far the best place to go to sit with friends and have a quiet conversation over some drinks
the service doesn't rush you, but they could be a tad more attentive
try the i can't believe it's not a cosmo, it's the best drink i've ever had! the rum punch is also very good
you can also nibble on food in the lounge area as well, limited menu, but if you ask to see the restaurant menu, the staff will accomodate
The food is very good, and the decor is very chic, but what's the deal with the service? I felt I was in a local coffee shop--waiter cleared first course with one hand and placed the main course with the other
We would have liked a few minutes between courses
Service needs to improve to keep pace with the food and decor
Whoever said they don't accept the Dine Out NY Coupon was wrong
There was no issue when I took a friend there for dinner a few weeks ago
And it was really good, the desserts are amazing and the decor tops it all off
It isn't so expensive if you order off of the prix-fixe menu
Just had dinner here for my birthday
8 of us
Being that my mother is Spanish i've been eating spanish food all my life, I'm a tough critic of Spanish food
The tapas here were genuinely delicious!! We were all so impressed
FINALLY
a good croquetta! The bartender Julio is very hospitable and (for the ladies
) VERY good looking and charming! :) Salsa band was very good
Overall, a great spot for drinks @ the bar or dinner in the dining area
Can't wait to go back! :o)
Ok, yes the service is so-so, but the food is great, and the bartenders are always friendly
And they always let us be as rowdy as want
I haven't left this place sober or hungry
Tapas is always expensive in my opinion, but this place is reasonable for tapas
My friends and I always take our out of town guests there, and we have a good time
Mojitos and the Oliva shot are recommended, as are the stuffed mushrooms, large shrimp, and any of the desserts
I don't get this other review- I just had dinner with 6 friends, and it was fantastic! The waiters are sassy, but that's one of the good things about going downtown
The food was delicious and well-priced, and we had a great experience
After being kept waiting for 45 minutes for our table, which we'd reserved for 9
30pm my friend and I spoke to the head waiter to point out that a reservation generally meant you didn't expect to be kept waiting
He was extremely rude and told us if we didn't like it we could leave (except he used a 4 letter word to get his point across)

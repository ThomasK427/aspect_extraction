The Thai and Vietnamese cuisine is absolutely to die for
The stuffed chicken wings appetizer and the Berkshire ribs will make your mouth water
I'm not usually a fan of Salmon but I tried it at this restaurant and I loved it
Whatever you order, you have to try the Vietnamese coffee after your meal
This Vietnamese/Thai restaurant is a great alternative for those who love Vietnamese /Thai cuisine but are tired of the typical entree selections available at other restaurants
The decor is trendy yet relaxing and the service is very friendly
The food is a little pricey but definitely worth it!!! This place is definitely worth checking out!!While you are there, try the stuffed chicken wings, the salmon and take a stroll into the restroom
its very nice!!! =)
If you are tired of asian fusion and are looking for something new yet authentic, check out this restaurant
As a diner who is not easily excited by new edgy places, I was surprised to find some unique dishes at Tigerland
Ambiance is chill enough for a group of friends, yet trendy (in a good way) to entertain clients
I highly recommend the Summer rolls angel wings to start
Don't expect the typical summer rolls, tigerlands summer rolls are tasty and unique
I even asked the waitress for the recipe
Ribs and scallops are an excellent choice
Since my husband I were first time diners, we haven't tried anything else yet but we are excited to go back
Also, the bottles of red wine were very good and priced so fairly, hence we had 2 bottles
I'm happy to see a down to earth newcomer in the city
Tigerland is the bestest new restaurant in NYC
From the great location to the great atmosphere/decor to the helpful/hot waitresses/waiters to the terrific food to the beautiful bathroom, Tigerland is nothing short of excellence
Words simply can not do justice for Tigerland, so i am not even going to try anymore, you just got try it yourself
I Highly recommend it!!!!
I like the cozy little atmosphere
The service was exceptional
Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious
Great place to bring friends
this new restaurant on the LES is a gem! the restaurant is clean, they play great music (while i was there i remember hearing gypsy kings and erykah badu), and the ambience is nice (dark woods, clean modern style decor)
a pretty good wine list- all local (NY) wines, very clean drinking
we tried the brotherhood reisling and the pinot- both great and very light
the food is delicious! viet/thai fusion but iwth the highest quality organic ingredients, and wild fish
we even got comped desert
the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful
a very casual but hip place, only open for dinner
expect a wait of at least 1/2 an hour on weekends
I've dined at Tigerland three times already since they've opened last week! the stuffed angel wings are amazing! i've tried the berkshire ribs, duck curry, and scallops for entrees - all are outstanding!! the homemade sodas, friendly service, and warm dining room all add to this special dinner experience
can't wait to go back!
Awesome combination of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine
All of the food tried was incredibly delicious
They have a great selection of wines and beers
Their homemade sodas are a must try
They use a lot of organic ingredients
The atmosphere is comfortable yet romantic and trendy
Tigerland is one of the best new restaurants in NYC
From the friendly and very helpful waiters to the terrific food
I highly recommend the Shrimp and Bacon Crepe as an appetizer
For a main course you can not go wrong with anything but the Ribs were excellent, as were the Glass Noodle with Seared Scallops
Authentic southeast asia flavoring - took my taste buds 9000 miles away!
I frequented the one in the west village and was excited for the new one which opened literally under my building
I always thought of Mexicana Mommas as a neighborhood spot that didn't have the attitude of the corporate cash-cows
Anyway, I went down on a Wednesday night to see if they had a long wait and the hostess said they had a table to accomodate my party
I then told her that the rest were upstairs and she said no problem
I called my group to come down
In the 3 minutes before my group arrived a random party walked by and then came in
Right in front of me the hostess gave up my table
When I told her that they were literally walking out the front door and I could see them 10 feet away she said there was nothing she could do
I couldn't believe how absurd her response was
I know restaurants need turn-over to survive but they also need repeat customers
My friend promised me this was a 'different Mexican' restaurant, and she was right
The place is adorable, and the entire staff is super friendly and down to earth
After eating at so many pretentious places in the city, I find this very refreshing
The margaritas are absolutely fabulous, made with fresh fruit and lime juice
You absolutely can't go wrong with anything on the menu
Watch out though, because many of the dishes are pretty spicy (this is coming from someone who's half Pakistani, mind you)- you might want to ask about this before ordering something
We went late on a Saturday night and sat right down, but watch out because the place is bitty and you'll probably have to wait if you don't go on off peak hours
They have a small bar where you can wait, but I would call before heading over to see what the wait is first
I am so happy this restaurant opened in our quality-food-at-fair-prices-deprived area
I've eaten at the other location on Hudson, and 12th St
allows for a much more relaxed and enjoyable eating experience
The special salsas that we tried were phenomenal and the guac was delicious as always
Our party had a fun time sampling the drink specials, I recommend the jalapeno margarita or any margarita
they use fresh lime juice
Everyone really enjoyed their entrees, but the hangar steak with chorizo was the overwhelming favorite
The staff was really great with helping us choose our order too
Highly recommended
at least once a week!
I was a little nervous about Tocqueville's moving to a new location, but now I am sure happy they did
As always Tocqueville is a calm relaxing space
Now they have added a more luxurious aspect to the whole experience
High Ceilings, very compofortable bar and fur lockers
The food, though similar in wording, has really gone up a few notches
High quality of ingredients have always been present but somehow everything tasts and looks even better than before
Not sure how they did it
The staff always accomidating and friendly helps you feel compfortable in the new space
I love the Private DIning room upstairs as well
Recently while dining at the bar I had the Andalusian Gazpacho, it was great! So was the squab with cherries
I love squab and it is so rare to find it on a menu
Thats what I love about Tocqueville though, they don't play it safe, they really know how to cook and prepare wonderful dishes no matter what ingredients
I look forward to spending many more relaxing evenings at Tocqueville

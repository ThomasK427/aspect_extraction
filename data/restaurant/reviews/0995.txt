The atmosphere is wonderful, the service is excellent
Paul picked out the wines throughout our meal and was not disappointed
Marco's meals were just a piece of heaven in your mouth
Surprise samplings were sent out and for the first time my husband ate asparagus and loved it and wanted more
We ordered the chocolate tart for desert, and was just great
If you get the chance this is a must go to restaurant
This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences, as my expectations after reading the reviews here were met short
First, the customer service at Hearth is topnotch
I had read (again, here) which items on the menu were suggested
The marinated sardines appetizer was one sardine (very good, though), the veal was lacking in taste
The lamb was very good, cooked to perfection, but the sausage served with it was very dry
Monkfish was just horrible across the board, overcooked and low quality, but I am not an expert with monkfish
The risotto was oversalted and difficult to enjoy, the duck was ok, the pasta dish very bland
The gnocchi was served overcooked, which I heard was the best in the city
The bread pudding, was just a mess
I'd have to say I think this place is very overhyped, but maybe just a very off night for the kitchen
Hearth has easily become our favorite restaurant over the past couple of years
The service was excellent and Marco Canora's cooking has never been better
We started with the Marinated Sardines and the Snapper Crudo
(to the complainer below, crudo=raw) We followed that with the Roasted Chatham Cod and the Monkfish Osso Buco
The kitchen graciously gave us a side of the gnocchi as well
Everything was paired with a bottle of Hans Lang Reisling
My wife chose Banana Cake for dessert, while I opted for a few pieces of cheese
All in all, it was a great evening
I see many comments here and at other sites mentioning small portions
I wouldn't describe the portions as small as much as I'd say appropriate
Also, the ingredients are of extremely high quality
Bottom line and no disrespect intended, some will not appreciate this style of restaurant and should go elsewhere
I hadn't been here in a while and just went back and yet agian was thrilled with my meal and service
We had the tasting dinner for $75
00 quite lovely- kobe beef was excellent, I personally did not care for the coconut dessert but the rest was devine
We took our out-of-town guests here, both big foodies who dine regularly at top-notch restaurants
The four of us were blown away: From the California wine country atmosphere and laid-back crowd to the apple cider doughnuts for dessert
The pumpkin and brown butter pasta is a MUST HAVE! We also loved the grilled octopus appetizer and the skate entree
Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable
I ordered a dish not knowing it had anchovies, and he graciously exchanged it for another
The wine - I think it was a Carabella pinot noir - was sensational
We totally look forward to our next visit!
My boyfriend and I went to Hearth to ring in the New Year and had an absolutely fabulous time! The atmosphere is nice and not pretentious or trendy
The food was incredible - apps, dinner, and dessert! The wine list was pretty lenghty - and was great because it offered me a taste of wine, in addition to just a glass
And the service
most likely the best service I've ever had out! The staff was very attentive even to the point that they would pair our food with other wine if we were disatisfied with our original choice
The prices are a bit high, but hey, this is New York - you certainly get what you pay for here! I highly recommend it!
On a friends suggestion, I had dinner here last night
Place has a good vibe
The food was delicious
The waiter was great, very helpful
The wine list was a little confusing, and he really helped me out by making a great suggestion
The decor is nothing special
pretty minimalistic, but the food and service make up for it
I had the scallop appetizer and the lamb entree
So good
This is a very cool place with excellent food, tasty cocktails, sexy modern design, and lively but not loud scene
Very expensive though and the the portions, from appetizers to dessert, are small
Each course is beautifully presented on your plate but, hey, don't be fooled, find your food in the middle of all that art: diet pieces!
Appetizer: Menu said snapper-we ordered
Menu neglected to mention it was uncooked
Poorly written Menu
Main Course: I ordered Lamb
75% fat, 20% Cartilage/bone 5% meat
Sides: We ordered creamed potatoes and Gnocchi
Both of which were utterly saturated in butter salt
Dessert: I ordered apple donuts, which the waiter gushed about
Warm, but hard as rocks
Maple cream was terrible too
Service was ok
Decor was nice
Nicely decorated with a nice environment and feel
Not too loud
Service was fantastic and knowledgeable, despite their casual dress
Sensing I didn't like my original wine choice, our waitress suggested I try another and helped me choose a perfect glass to go with my meal
The foie gras app and my lamb entree were delicious
Portions were neither too small nor too big
Desserts were decadent, especially the donuts which would typically sound boring
Very cozy and comfortable ambience
One of the most romantic places i've been to, cozy atmosphere, romantic lights, intimate, excellent (and wholly unexpected!) live music on Fri night
While many restaurants have open kitchens, none will entertain you as much as Hearth
Chef Marco and his staff give you the unedited behind the scenes look at what a real NYC kitchen is like
Marco's wit, charm and painstaking commitment to quality are a joy to behold
My wife and I sat at the kitchen bar for 3 1/2 hours in utter amazement of every aspect involved
The food is impeccible!! Scallop carpaccio light and fruity
Ribbiletta soup was heart warming
Pumpkin tortillini exploded with flavors of fall
Desserts were subtle and simple, perfect after an incredible meal and a GREAT SHOW!
If you want the slowest service ever! and high priced average to good food
head to hearth
We waited nearly an hour to receive our appetizers! we were already ordering our second bottle of wine before any 'real food' came, it would have helped if the bread was good, but it was almost stale
and when our orders finally did come
the portions were small-and please note that we were a table of mostly Italians with fine tuned palets-used to meager portions big on taste-but this was average
where was our waitner? we had to flag a bus boy if we wanted anything, the service was so horrendous we will never ever go back
but the place probably will close soon
so there's no chance of that
what a ripoff! and where were our truffles?
I am a regular here and I have never had a dish I didn't like
The menu is a la carte style and everything is great
I had the pleasure (yes, it was great!) to sit at the kitchen bar last time and we were served extra tastings of special dishes, and we got to enjoy the energy of the kitchen staff
We are big wine people and the GM and most of the bartenders can always recommend a unique bottle of great wine
Most of all, the service is impeccable
I stop and tell the staff often because I am overwhelmed by it!
Out-competed in Manhattan

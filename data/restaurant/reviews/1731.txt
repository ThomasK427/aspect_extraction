Have an old fashion egg cream, but don't forget to make them use the fountain soda
A throwback to the old days of Brooklyn
The place looks like a restaurant that has been transplanted from a local neighborhood into Manhattan
Seating in the rear and have a great cheap sandwich
Can't be beat
I was in town from San Francisco, and found myself staring at the storefront
I just wish you could get pastrami like that in SF
Eisenberg's is the throwback to the 40's and 50's, right in midtown
This landmark, which consistently doles out excellent tuna melts and pastrami cannot be beat
They only have a few tables, but those in the know eat at the counter
I fear posting this review will bring even more people, but it's worth it
It may not be the ideal lunch spot for some, but those are people who you don't want to be around
So pull up a stool, have an egg cream and pastrami on Rye, listen to the din around you and realize again why you gotta love New York
This place was great! The food was very italian - light and delicious
The service was wonderful and the staff was extremely attentive
I did not leave the place like I needed to be rolled out - how true Italian food should be
PS- the bufflo moztarella melts in your mouth
I would DEFINATELY return
Also prices are very reasonable
We found Novita by chance and it was truly serendipity
Dinner started with a very nice pinot noir and continued in the same vein
I love a place with good home made breadsticks and these were
We proceeded to split an appetizer of grilled asparagus topped with parmesan
Yummy! Then on to escolan and a steak paillard with mushrooms, both of which we shared
Both were excellent, but I can't say enough about the escolan - very meaty, very tasty perfect texture
We finished with coffee and luscious home made sorbets - lemon mint, raspberry and mango whcie we also shared
We will definitely return
The cost including tip was $60 each
I really do! Creative dishes like this separate Novita from the rest of the NY Italian restaurant scene
Novita is the real deal, the dishes are authentic Italian but with a modern flair
The porcini mushroom ravioli are a great example
This is a standard dish from the north of Italy raised to a new level by the chef through painstaking attention to detail
The flavours are subtle and pure but can be lost on somebody looking for fradiavolo sauce
Novita has a long list of specials which is how I discovered the stuffed zucchini flowers! Service at this restaurant is excellent
I frequently ask for small changes to the dishes and have never been refused or looked at with scorn
Frankly I wish there were more places like this in NY and I think the amount of Italian I hear spoken there on any given night says it all
Hi,  I lived in Italy and am very picky about my Italian food
This is the best I've had anywhere in the city
I always bring my Italian friends when they visit me
The buffalo mozzarella is flown in and so moist and tasty
They have exceptional wine, fresh fish, pasta and seasonal delicacies -- procini ravioli delectibles drizzled with truffle oil
For dessert I have tiramisu and other tasty suprises with pistachio and chocolate
Even the waiters are authentic and knowledgeable, the hostess is the most accomodating (with great sense of style) in all of the city and service in impeccable
It is also a private/initmate setting where celebrities like Brooke Shields, Julia Roberts, Giselle and Daryl Hannah know that they can get fabulous meals without being noticed
Lunch is great -since it isn't echoy
I've seen power brokers take advantage of this making deals
I can;t remember the area of italy but it is Northern, like Swiss border, Italian food
The mustard encrusted lamb was worth the trip
It was absolutely devine - high quality meat, cooked perfectly in a simple reduction and was a generous portion
My girlfriend loved the calamari salad- grilled calamari was meaty and fresh
The monkfish was more light than bland
The desserts were just excellent
I don;t know what night anyone could catch this staff off
They were friendly, witty and attentive and they worked in perfect harmony as a team
Other waiters frequently servicing us if our waiter wasn't around
Ok the manager did stand at the bar the whole time looking like his wife left him, he lost all his money at the track and had been drinking the rest of the day
The atmosphere was plesant and quiet, albeit a bit sterile
Across the menu, everything our group ordered was fantastic
The waiters can shoot off a 5 minute long list of specials, and they know the menu very well
My favorite touch was the complimentary bruschetta with sun dried tomato that came with a delicious bread basket
Outdoor seating was nice b/c it's on a quiet street with tall buildings that keep you in the shade and let you really enjoy being outdoors
Save room for the best tiramisu I've had in the city
Just got back from a week in New York where we had our best dining experience on our last night there at Novita
This was a pleasant surprise because earlier in the week we had dined at one of the most celebrated restaurants in the city and were quite satisfied
When we arrived at the restaurant we found it warm and inviting
Our waiter was gracious and very helpful with our choices
He recommended an assortment of appetizers which included the calamari salad, stuffed zucchini flowers, and porcini ravioli with truffles (all exquisite)
For the main course we all chose the branzino
It was magnificenttender and full of flavor
We also thought the desserts were amazing and agreed that the tiramisu was the best wed ever had
Well certainly be revisiting Novita when well be back in New York in the fall
Cant recommend this restaurant enough!
can a waiter display? check out Novita to find out
Food was passable but nothing special
Prices on the other hand are pretty good--entrees run below $25 for almost everything
On the plus side, in some areas they tried hard
Specials included things with fresh truffles but the food--something like 12-15 apps and a similar # of entree choices--often care up bland and repetitive
There must have been 6-8 things with rucola in them
Our waiter barely made eye contact, leaned against the wall and oddly the banquette we were seated on
Yes, he rattled off the long list of specials from memory but yawned a few times doing so
Food came out fast
Fish and pasta seem to be the way to go
Regulars and oldies may find it's midle-of-the-roadness soothingly pleasant, but there's nothing that makes making a trip worthwhile
Went there for Valentines Day
Upon arrival we were treated as VIP's
The hostess couldnt have been nicer
The 4 course price fix menu was superb
You can never have enough truffles in your meal I always say
Even when my girlfriends steak that was to be wrapped up to be taken home was thrown away by mistake
They stepped up and cooked her a whole new entree to take with us
that my friends is class
Will certanly go again and again and again
I have been there many times since i'm leaving in NYC, and this place is great
above all the food is tasty, how to explain, the real italian deal
The staff can be not too friendly but rarely and truelly, have you been in a good mood all the days of your life ? Well, i love going back there
I usually have the zuchinni flowers stuffed with ricotta on prociutto and the warm chocolate tart with pistachio sauce and an amaretto, but i always try the other dishes of the people i am going with and i always been delighted
Just writting this ratting make me want to go there right now !!!
Having lived in Monaco (one of Italy's neighboring countries)for a period of time, I am very picky when it comes to Italian food and even pickier when it comes to northern Italian food
Novit, specializing in Piedmontese food(Piedmont: the most western region of Italy and producer of many great wines often underrated in the US), serves many spectacular concoctions
Both the pasta and meat dishes are very traditional, authentic, and tasty

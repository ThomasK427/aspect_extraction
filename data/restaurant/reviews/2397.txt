We came for a special occasion, but otherwise I probably would've found the prix fixe menu too expensive
The food, however, was GREAT, definitely worth the money in my opinion
The atmosphere was maybe a little stuffy, and I personally thought their cruise ship decor was a little corny, but overall I still had a wonderful experience there
Sadly I found a hair in my food
I pretty much have eaten at every venue known to man
Hey it happens, but their staff's attempt to fix the issue was disgraceful, especially for a high-end restaurant
I still paid $200+ for my appetizers and my other-halves meal
I was not even offered a glass of wine or desert as a, I am sorry
SHAMEFUL
As I mentioned to the maitre-dee, My past experiences at with an order of filet-fish at McDonald's have been more pleasant!
I actually joined citysearch for the sole purpose of adding a negative review for this restaurant
The service was terrible
My date is allergic to dairy products, and this was explained to the waiter, who confirmed he understood
She was restricted to ordering 2 appetizers rather than a main course, (but we were still charged for a main course due to the price fixed nature of the menu)
And to top it off, one of her dishes was still made with dairy! Don't eat here if you have any food allergies, because they really don't care if you get sick
Pretty lousy service for a $300+ dinner
I went to Oceana for my birthday
My husband could not get reservations at Le Bernardin, so he decided to take me here
What a wonderful birthday surprise! We were cheerfully greeted seated at a beautiful corner banquette
very romantic
The service was outstanding; very attentive, but never intrusive
Then there was the food, which was artfully presented too delicious for words
I highly recommend the Loup de mer
Dessert was equally as impressive
Overall, I would say run, don't walk to Oceana
You will not be disappointed by the stellar service, wonderful food understated elegance!
I came here for lunch with a group of four
We were seated immediately, although the restaurant was surprisingly busy for a midtown place
We sat on the second floor
The decor was very interesting and pleasant
The service was impeccable - just as it should be
The soft-shell crab appetizer was very tasty and I am told the tuna tartare was wonderful
The swordfish entree was good, but could not compare to that at Town
Another person in our party, however, thought it was excellent
Two of my companions had two different kinds of seabass and loved it
Everyone loved the desserts
Overall, the dining experience was excellent and I will be returning to this restaurant
If you go, be aware that the menu is almost entirely seafood, and that although jackets are not required, many guests will wear them
I can see why this restaurant has rated so high
I have been to many fine restaurants and this is one of the best
The last 2 times I have been to New York, I have made reservations weeks in advance so I am sure not to forget
Beautiful atmosphere, fabulous food, and exceptional service
We arrived and were seated promptly--so far so good
We were then given a complimentary palate appetizer which we couldn't eat (one of our party is pesco-vegetarian, the other is allergic to cheese)
While these initial apps seemed inventive (pureed artichoke with bacon reduction in a shot glass), the wait staff should have asked before presenting them
Many of the appetizers and entrees have meat or cheese which severely limited our choices and you can't order a la carte, only the 3-course price fixed meal
The tuna tartar was overwhelmed by the horseradish and ginger
My skate with pastrami(!)--at least I can eat meat--was so salty that is was virtually inedible
The deserts were good but not stellar
The bill was nearly $200
For $100 per person, I expect a much better meal
Very disappointing
In a city packed to the gills with fine seafood restaurants, not one comes close to the consistently exceptional dining experience that is Oceana
The decor and ambience is great, albeit a little muted in the main dining room - turn the jazz up guys - but the food is the main event
The tuna tartare is outstanding, and the mains extraordinary The John Dory with leeks and mushroom simply melts in the mouth, the unusually rich red-wine sauce perfectly accompanying it
My wife's turbot was equally delicious, as were the array of sinfully rich desserts
Throw in a terrific selection of wines, and a truly scrumptious ice-wine, and you really do have the perfect restaurant
I went with my boyfriend to Oceana for his birthday and we were surprised by the classy, quiet atmosphere, we loved the boat-like interior and enjoyed excellent service
He wore a suit and I a dress which was appropriate
We ordered the 6-course tasting menu, his with wine pairing for $160, mine was $110 without
The quality of the wine and champagne was very good, our appetizers included lobster and shrimp, and our entrees included codfish and sea bass, all were presented creatively and in small portions
This also included a 3-course dessert tasting menu, to our surprise, when desserts kept on coming
They gave both of us each a different dessert so we ended up tasting six
It was delicious
We expected great seafood and got great dessert also
This may be one of the last restaurants that still retains a dress code
The boys all dressed in jackets
Much more intimate and personal than Jean Georges, and felt classier for the understated comfort
Closer to Bouley, but smaller and a bit more innovative in the food prep
This is the place to have a nice quiet date, where the food/ambience compliments conversation
Wonderful
I was very impressed with the quality of the seafood
It was so fresh, clean, and tasteful that I found myself trying to savour each bite
The service was exactly what this level of a resteraunt needs
At first, I was concerned that the portion size (small to medium/small) was not going to be enough to fill me up
But with so many courses, by the end of the meal I was absolutely stuffed! My Long Island Tea was perfect
I felt very comfortable, as well
Prices are of course high, but typical with this level of cooking in New York establishments
I'm not sure what the person below was referring to
She must have spent a lot of money on wine
The entire menu is prix-fixe--for dinner it's $68 per person, which includes an hors d'ouevre plate, an appetizer, an entree, a dessert, and then that little plate they bring you after the dessert of little bite-size desserts
Did they order two entrees a piece? For $110, you can get wine matched to each course
but that would still only be $220
Hmmm
I took my parents there, we drank wine and ate FANTASTIC food, and left stuffed to the gills and it was $300 bucks
Each course was better than the next
This restaurant has won a lot of impressive awards in the past year--10,000 critics can't be wrong
I made a reservation 1 month prior to my visit to Oceana
It was my mother's birthday
I also confirmed it 2 days before
But when we showed up - no reservation? After a little yelling, a manager helped us out
So we waited 30 minutes
My mother is old and doesn't like to wait
We finally get our table (they bought us 2 glasses of wine to make up for it) and ordered
Then 15 mins later our waiter comes back and says they ran out
Great, so we order again
Then 35+ mins later our food finally comes out
It's the wrong thing and it's cold
By the time we finally got our food it was very late
We should have left after they screwed up my reservation

It was perfect
The prix fix lunch menu was failry priced and offered many options
It's close the theaters and service was very good
We liked the cozy atmosphere and will return
The prix fixe menu was quite extensive
For $22 I got baked mussels, steak bordelaise (a kind of red wine sauce), and creme caramel (flan)
My party of 6 didn't go in expecting much, especially considering the place was pretty empty on a Thurs
night at 7:30, but everyone was pretty pleased, and there were many choices on the menu (around 15 entrees)
The service wasn't spectacular, but it was acceptable
One of the best Restaurants I have been
The Food is great and the workers are good
If you are expecting excellent french food look elsewhere
Deserts are terrible and duck is dry
But if you want to get to the show on time and are not very picky about food this place does the job well
THe wait staff is courteous and fast
Good food, creatively seasoned, and very reasonable prices
Dinner for 2 including appetizers and wine, tax, tip - $65
Good and prompt service
Limited menu
Just ate here for the first time and was very pleased
Great menu selection - I would have tried any of the entrees
Decided on the pumpkin-seed catfish and really enjoyed it
Portions were good and prices were certainly reasonable by midtown standards
The corn fritters were wonderful
The servers have been very attentive the times I have a dined here
It is a great place to eat after a theater show
This is one of my favorite places to go eat, the food is consistently great, drinks are good, service is very speedy and you can just relax and enjoy the food in their booth style seats
Ive been here numerous times and the food has always been good, try the corn fritters for appetizer, the peppercorn steak (yummy) or salmon sandwich for entre and the flourless chocolate cake is a must
Everything on their menu is delicious
The food was delicious (try the fig/sweet potato ravioli or the pumpkin crusted catfish!!) and also perfectly cooked, not overdone!!! The wonderful food descriptions were enticing and truly lived up to the expectations!!!! (I'm a gourmet cook myself and my husband and I often find restaurant meals disappointing and very boring, predictable flavourings)
The cuisine is a perfect blend of American cuisine meets south American with fantastic, creative sauces!!! I would recommend Zuni to anyone looking for great food, nice ambiance (refeshing to find a place without in-your face lighting) and a warm, somewhat trendy decor/artwork
Check it out!!!!
This is a warm little pubby place decorated w/original artwork - i've been here on at least 4 occasions and have enjoyed it always - the mini fresh corn muffins are great as was their other items tried - while i live in jersey now a friend in the nabe brought me originally - lo key good service - never crowded or rushed -
Decent
Nothing to brag about
Very reasonably priced, though
The one major flaw - the menu is very heavy doused with winter flavors ingredients
I prefer something lighter fresher in the summer months
Very reasonable wine list
I've been going to this restaurant for over two years
It's perfect for pre-theatre dinner because it's off the beaten path
The food and service are always good and it's never crowded
Always at the top of my list for entertaining family, friends, and clients
Always loved afghan food
Been to this chains other locations and find that the one in Jackson Heights is the best over all
Here the food was good, but my wife noticed the rice here was not as whole ie crushed and other minor differences
Food was good along with decor
What amazes me is the fact that there is no permanant/professional wait staff
Seems like they drag people off the streets to serve there
What a pity, that just ruins the whole atmosphere
I've been going to this place for almost 9 years now
It is sooo good
I'm afraid to tell its best kept secret because then the word will get out and I'll never get a reservation
there is a private room in the back where you can sit on the floor, with decor and authentic garb from the middle east
There are candles and pillows, which make this spot very romantic!!!
I have frequented this restaurant a number of times with friends and family and at times passing by
The food has always been great
There are bread is delicious and fresh
Although it is a very queit place, but you can catch up with your friends and family in that environment
I will strongly recommend this quiet, cute and good food restaurant
The owners are very welcoming and generous in their servings
Other than a good location I can't think of any other reason to dine here
We were a party of 7 people and two had to send their dinner back
The veal was like shoe leather and the salmon had no taste
I had been there a few times going back a year or two
Something has for sure changed
and not for the better
Our waiter had a bad attitude and should not work with the public
The food was almost tasteless and the service was very poor
Entrees were served before the appetizer was finished
The calamari was undercooked and tough
The special of shrimp and sole had no taste at all
The bread was a below average white bread, not a nice crusty Italian that I would have expected and the garlic infused oil had been salted to excess
The only thing positive to say is the restaurant is well located in the theatre district, but there are many, many far better Italian restaurants nearby - choose one of them
My friend in NY took me here for my birthday and I must say it was quite an ejoyable experience
The food was fabulous
It was a little pricy, but that's New York
The service was great the staff was VERY friendly
Then again my friend is a regular there, so she knows EVERYONE!! I have NO bad things to say about it except that they don't have free refills on Soda
Us folks in Washington are used to having free refills
Other than that it was GREAT!!!
Almost a year ago, I stumbled upon Puleo's Too, a small and inviting Italian restaurant in the heart of Mid-town NYC, and not a week goes by that I do not have at least have one meal there
The food is prepared exquisitely
I have had almost every item on the menu and have not been dissapointed once! Puleo's makes you feel like home with their delicious meals and fast and curteous wait staff
The Rustic and original look of the restaurant just add the familiar ambience
If you are visiting New York, and have an oppurtunity, do not hesitate to try Puleo's Restaurants
They cater to all with a hearty appetite for excellent Italian food
And if you are watching a show, Puleo's thrives on pre-theatre rush and will have you sat, fed, and happy with time to spare for your show! A MANGIARE!!!!
Living in New York, I tend to think of restraunts in the Theatre District as serving small portions of mediocre overpriced food served by surly wanna-be actors
At Puleo's Too I couldn't have been more wrong
Healthy portions of great down home Italian food served by a friendly staff
Nice martinis also
This is the place to be when you want true great italian food! You cant go wrong with anything you order!
The food and service are excellent
The waiters are aware that you have a show to catch and do a very good job without making you breathless
A wide range of choices and all the food is excellently prepared
We would go back agin
The atmosphere was extremely enjoyable and the waiters were great
I would definetly go back just to see the waiters! In addition, the food was exceptional and the waiters even gave us a fine tour of the city! It was truly a memorable experience!!!
the prix fixe Lunch and dinner are great bargain

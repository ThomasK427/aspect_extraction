The atmosphere is definitely family-style, the portions are huge (usually each platter serves 2-3 people), but the food is fairly bland
(I am vegetarian, so perhaps it's just the veggie platters)
However, for the same price range, you can find higher quality food and a more attentive staff in the area
The restaurant is almost the entire block long and as such the service is not as personal
I've been here several times with large groups and also with just one other person and everytime was excellent
For the price I do not see why people are leaving bad comments on the service
The food is always good, portions are very large(always plan on a doggy bag), and the overall cost is relatively inexpensive
I can see why sometimes people feel the service is lacking but what could you expect when 70% of the customers are part of a large group? Of course the service will be slow at times when the waiters are helping each other out by delivering the dinners to each table as it ready to be served
Tony's DiNapoli, while it isn't the most extravagent restaurant in NY, it is always good and always a pleasure to visit - to put it bluntly - its the best deal for Italian in NY
The food is excellent and inexpensive! (2 people can eat one dish at least!) So far in the comments no one has mentioned what I consider the highlight of the restaurant
the frozen peach bellini
They are amazing! If you have never had one, try one! If oyu have had one try this one, they are the best!!
I will always come back when I have people in town
It is great for a large group
The Sangria is AWESOME and they don't have that at Carmine's
We went here for my sisters Bacchelorette party with 9 girls
It was so easy to plan a group event here with a prix fix menu
We all loved the food, which was endless
Our server was so helpful and nice, he even took lots of pictures for us without a problem
By the end of the night we were all trying to plan another event so we can come back! This place is great for having a really fun time with a group of people
The calamari and mozzarella en corroza are the best!!
We went for my sister-in-law's bachelorette party
They seated us as soon as we arrived, even though we were very early
We had set up the prix-fix to make it easier
The drinks flowed freely, the food seemed to never end, the server was attentive, and the ambiance was great
They even sent us home with enough leftovers to feed several people the next day! I would recommend this place, but not if you're looking for a quiet romantic meal!
I've gone to Tony's before due to the great food and service
So I decided to have my Bridal Shower there in Feb
2003
The waiter was very attentive and courtious
The food was great and nothing was rushed up until dessert
All of a sudden, there was a waitress hovering over the table and rudely put balloons on our table that belonged to another party
As the waitress cleaned the table in a rush she knocked over a party bag containing a glass bottle with bath oil
She picked it up and moved it out of her way
My friend picked up the bag and the oil spilled on her suede pants
The manager apologized and promised to take care of the cleaning bill but that was it
The waitress didn't even apologize
The food was good but this was unnecessary
Good food doesn't make up for rude service
The portions are huge and definately tasty
We had zucchini fritti, chicken piccata, and desert
Everything was great except the the service needs a kick in the butt
(just a little one)
Sit outside and people watch as well
Tony's is a great place to go on a date or with family
The food is served family style and even then, you wind up with a doggie bag
Although copious, the food itself is good (not excellent)
The appetizers are almost all fried or seafood
The eggplant rollatine was delicious as were the Tuscan-style steaks
(45
00 for 2 LARGE NY Strip steaks plus veggies
)
I've been to the two locations so far and the service is just the same
WONDERFUL
The food is filling, and tasty
And the atmosphere is great and semi-romantic
4 out of 5 stars
I've been to Tony Di Napoli 3 times so far and always have a good time
It's always a busy place, though the service is always very good
It's also not expensive
The food is good and plentiful
It's good to go with a group if you can as the food is family style though you don't have to
The first time we went was for New Year's and we had a blast as they gave out party hats, horns, etc
I always have fun here and will definitely go back again
This place is a lot of fun to eat with a group or if you are especially hungry
The food is good, not amazing, but for the price and the amount they serve, it is worth it
Both entrees we ordered were very flavorful and good and the service is great
The waiter was extremely helpful and very nice
This restaurant is great and I would recommend it for groups or families with kids
It is also just an informal, fun place to eat
At Tony's, the food is excellent, as is the service and the prices
Family style plates serve 2 to 3, and it's incredibly kid-friendly
Come early, because even with 3 enormous dining rooms it fills up fast!
You'll eat plenty and cheap here! We ordered several large appetizers, and several pasta and meat entrees
Note: we were 10 men and we couldn't finish!  Very loud, very hectic, very much worth the experience
If you wanna gorge yourself with quality Italian this place is perfect!
Great Ragotini w/Egglplant and Mozzarella!!!!! Service was prompt, and courteous
If you dont have children, keep in mind you wont enjoy a ROMANTIC dinner for two! Family restaurant = Babies, Toddlers and Kids! All in all, food is good and I'll be sure to return during the day, when school is in session
Even though everyone I talk to raves about the food and this restaurant, both my experiences here have been highly dissapointing
The food is decent, too commercialized Italian food, and very verylarge portions, which ca end up being very expensive if you are not up for sharing and ordering wisely
Its a great place to go for kid's birthday parties and large group evens, however, dont le the never ending line out the block mislead you
The food is excellent and the family style platters ensure that everyone in the party gets more than enough to eat
Affordable pricing and good atmosphere
It's a good place to go with a group of people
Family dinner, reunion, birthday party----one of the best choices-----Tony's!
I was with my parents looking for another Italian restaurant in the area and just happened to find this tiny, cozy restaurant
We were right that we decided to have the late lunch at Firenze
the wine was great (me and mom picked different white wine, dad had a glass of red), appetizer (meat and cheese combo, the mozzarella was awesome) and pasta were just perfectly prepared and they even divided them into separate plates for us since we were sharing those
I loved the cappuccino and Tiramisu to finish it up!! The waiters were very professional and friendly so we could really relax and enjoy the entire meal
Me and mom actually visited Firenze again for a dinner a few months later, and it was just as great
This is a great find
good food, good wine, good service! Romantic atmosphere, perfect for a special evening
The service was wonderful
you'll be friends with the owner waitstaff by desert
The food and ambience is top notch! It's a very relaxing, romantic setting in the heart of the upper east side
I've been many times and always recommend to my friends
They really know how to impress their guests - definitely worth checking out!
I've come in here 3 times already and its always an AWESOME meal
They have an extensive wine list
However, it came in a thick binder (just the lables) and not very organized

whenever i have guests from out of town, i bring them here for saturday lunch
at nights it gets pretty busy
lunch is your best bet if you don't have reservations
their gnocchi is fantastic
great italian wines
fantastic restaurant, a great place for dates and a couple of good friends
casual and comfortable
With so many new so called italian restaurants opening (and closing) daily in nyc, anyone who is intended to open a new spot in the city should go to borgo antico and take note about how a genuine italian restaurant should really be
From the menu, a big step forward from the classic italian fares, to the attentive service and joyful feeling you get from the moment you step in, to the moment you have to leave even though you don't ever want to
Kudos to the owner and the waiting staff to make me feel at home!!
This was THE worst dining experience in my life
Our server was so blatantly rude, belligerent and condescending on several occasions that I personally felt abused
For instance, when my friend politely explained that her dish was really salty, she grudgingly took the dish from the table and then came back to tell us that she tasted the dish in the kitchen and didn't know what my friend was talking about as it wasn't salty at all
Soon after, as my friend was quickly trying to decide on an alternative dish, our server stated, I don't care what you decide
I would never take the time to write a review unless I felt really strongly about my experience and this experience was despicable
Just one block south of Union Square you will find Borgo Antico, a charming Village Italian that offers authentic dishes, artfully prepared by Chef Giuliano Matarese and graciously served by owner Giovanni Iovine and his staff
My table started with the mussels, scallops and Insalata del Borgo (organic greens, artichokes and parmesan), and then finished with the Pappardelle Porcini (wide ribbons, porcini mushroom truffle oil), the salmon and Polipetti alla Luciana (baby octopus, capers-olive-tomato sauce, grilled polenta)
However, decision-making wasnt easy, as everything sounded delicious
Big plus: Our waiter helped us choose a bottle of wine from their large selection that would complement all three dishes
Too full to order dessert, we declined the offer but were immediately surprised with a plate of cookies and dish of homemade ice cream
Borgo Antico's generous service and savory dishes make for a satisfying summer evening in the city
this antic italian place is the best to take your lover and friends
interior and music is romantic and nice to chill
the owner and waiters are very friendly, i could see they try thier best to make customers confortable
they are also very flexible for your request (foods, drinks, and even music)
we had full course, from apetizer to desert, everything was delicious
i would like to have dinner there at least once a week with my friends
Dining at Borgo Antico was the one of the best out-of-the room activities my wife and I had on our short Honeymoon in the Capital Town Of The World
We were lucky to found this restaurant close to our hotel
We did not have a lot of time to search around
But what we found was amazing
Nice, cozy, and romantic place with very friendly vibe
We got table on the second floor next to window
Great table
Waiter who took care of us was on the ball
Easy going and not pretentious
We left up to him to decide our diner and he made our evening
Everything he choose was perfect
Fist course, second, third
desert, wine
Just what we were looking for
People, they know pasta
Next trip to NY and we'll be there again
Over much deliberation for the right place I decided to celebrate my birthday party with a big group of friends and family at Borgio Antico because the owner himself called me concerning the cake I had wanted to bring
What a waste of time and money
The service was not hit or miss
It just simply did not exsist
My party was ignored the entire time
We waited an hour and forty five minutes before any food was served
It was very hot and stuffy as there was no air condition or fan to cool folks off
During dinner I kept thinking of different restaurants in New York City I could have went to instead of Borgio Antico
Looks can be decieving
Please do not waste your time McDonalds has better service
A great place to celebrate with friends anytime
Food is delicious and not too expensive, great value for the quality
Service is attentive and friendly
You just can't go wrong here!
The menu is basically classic Italian, prepared with care and imaginationl the chef preserves the individuality of his ingredients, always delivering a treat to the palate
The downstairs bar is pleasant, but the upstairs main dining room is special: a large, tall room, with brick walls ornamented with spaced wooden pilasters--an effect both rustic and elegant
Service is polite and expeditious
Down the steps to Borgo Antico is an entry to a wonderful experience
The staff is friendly, knowledgable and efficient
The wine list is well selected and provides a range of offerings with fair pricing
Dining downstairs allows for a more relaxed environment with the same great food
My husband and I eart here when we have a moment of freedom from our five-year-old
The food and the service are impeccable
You must try them
My orders were not ready when they were supposed to be and the truffles were not what I expected
I had placed an order a week ago and today it was not ready, even though I called in yesterday to remind them
The truffles were completely different from the samples I was given and no one seemed to know why, or be able to offer me an explanation for the sudden change
They proceeded to give us the desserts that were on display
Never once did they apologize for the inconvenience
In fact they noted that I was trying to be cheap when choosing the truffles so they were doing me a favor by giving me extra bags
I only hope that when I pick up the THREE large cakes that I also ordered, they will be boxed, resemble what I wanted and are freshly prepared
Cool little cake place
Everything here is brown, hip, fun and solid if not above average cakes
Pretty people and Takehome bakery service to go, too
The cakes are a no brainer- fabulous
The Lemon Orange Teacake, The Chocolate Raspberry and The Queen D (hazelnut!) are superb
Good mousse
The cookies here are not big chewy chocolate chip or oatmeal affairs, but butter cookies and not super sweet-interesting flavors like like anise and chocolate with a teeny bit of black pepper
They do a nice ginger snap
The jam filled sandwich cookies are always a big hit
They have tasty cheesesticks and another savory with olive paste thats excellent
Their chocolate berry basket is a spectacular dessert -almond cake, candied almonds, pastry cream , fresh whipped cream all topped with fresh berries INSIDE a dark chocolate basket
Not cheap here but you can taste quaility ingredients and skill, so it's a good value
People are nice-may get a little frazzled at peak times and holidays
The cakes are great!! Little pricy but well worth it
I always bring the cakes to parties and get compliments on the way they look taste
Don't go out of your way to get there if you are a cookie person
They aren't bad but nothing to write home about
The Bee cake is one of my favorites too!
OK, so the service at Blackhound isn't stellar
But it's not really bad, either
I've been going there forever and granted, there's only one staff member who's overwhelmingly nice, the rest are just average, which is really fine
That doesn't detract from the fact that Blackhound has the most unbelievable desserts in NYC
It's a pattiserie, NOT a Veneiro's-type Italian joint, and everything (believe me, I've tried it all) is UNBELIEVABLE
The smartest thing they do is display their desserts in the windows, because they look as good as they taste
I adore Blackhound and I guarantee that you will too
aT $6 a pop, Their mini-cakes are perfect birthday gifts

Not sure why the reviews are somewhat poor here
its not a fancy eatery, but rather, an eclectic chill spot to grab some healthy food at very healthy prices
Service was actually good when i was there on two occasions
waiter brought everything i wanted right away with little wait and no attitude at all
i would recommend this place as a cool date spot and meet up with a friend spot
mildly impressive decor, not outlandish but big zebra couch theme going on there, but hey, its the village! go and enjoy! i did
People rave about the Yaffa Cafe
It's open late, the staff is great, the food is delicious


I just don't get it the 3 times I've been there my food was insufferably bland
It was like the chef was cooking a special dietary menue in a retirement home
I once had the salad, with the dressing which was scant and quite honestly the same dressing used in sushi restraunts
It was not bad but nothing to write home about for sure
I had the worst soba noodles I'd ever had in my life there
It is crowded most times and the staff while somewhat friendly was rather slow
In fact on my first visit there the waiter was apathetic at best
The kitsch was cute and engaging enough to distact me from my utterly banal meal
The Yaffa Cafe is really original
The carrot dressing of their salad is really delicious
The food is not amazing but it's a good value for money: it's quite cheap and portions are huge
Staff is always welcoming and nice
Their backyard is really charming in summer
You can't go wrong with Yaffa's great brunch menu - their home fries are amazing - but the portion is too small to satisfy my craving
I've eaten here a half a dozen times, only for brunch, and they've never dissappointed
The only recommendation that I would make would be to give us some more food for our buck!
I have given Yaffa many chances to redeem itself
But I now always walk a block beyond it to 7A, Stingy Lulu's, the Sidewalk Cafe or even take a cab to Florent simply because Yaffa is *that* bad
Yaffa's food is merely so-so
If the wait staff is fast, they'll be rude
If they're friendly, they'll be slow
If friendly and fast, then the order will be wrong
They'll refuse to make two separate checks for the only table in the place at 5:30am on a Tuesday solely because it's a pain
Good things: the interior is funky, the patrons are hip, and there are complimentary Yaffa Condoms at the register
However, the place is cramped and the lights are bright
Don't come here when you actually want some decent food and good service
Come here when you want to impress out-of-town friends with your funky neighborhood
The Yaffa salad (with this FABULOUS carrot ginger dressing) is to die for! I seriously crave it all the time! The servers have always been extremely nice, and they never rush you
I also love the colorful decor
lots of red and animal print
it's perfect for a date! I highly recommend this place
Oh, and if you like chocolate, try a heated slice of the chocolate mud pie
it's as light as a souffle and melts in your mouth!
there is nothing special about the food served at yaffa
microwaving a tv dinner for yourself would probably look and taste better
our waiter was great, however
and they are very generous with the coffee refills
For the longest time I was dying to go to Yaffa for dinner
What a let down!! The food was inedible! I got a veggie stirfry that was drowning in oil and was very bland
Same goes for my husband's meal
We both left hungry and disappointed
I have been going to Yaffa for years for it's cheap and basic fare, but I had no idea that Yaffa has a huge and very East Villagely-decorated garden in the back! Takes a little longer for the waitress to get to you, but it's really nice
I'll be hitting this again this summer
Although, I'm wondering why anyone would call this place romantic
I suppose it's romantic if who you're with is romantic, you know, like K-Mart is if someone proposes to you there
This place is the cutest
go there for a meal but if you are there late and just want to grab a beer they won't sneer at you
Very cozy rich ambiance
The beautiful outdoor garden made the evening special, as me, my boyfrien, my sister and her boyfriend had one of the best dinners in a long time
We sat there for many hours far into the early morning, ordering a few appitizers ever now and then
The waiters were always there when we needed them but also let us have our privacy
None of us ever wanted to leave!
I went here with a friend who was in love with the Yaffa decor
The inside was eclectic and charming in a crazy sort of colorful way
It was cute to sit there and take in the crazy colors all around me, but when the food came
I had Fettucine Alfredo and it was the most blah tasting thing ever
It tasted like buttered noodles with a hint of flavor, and my friend also though her food lacked flavor
What a great way to experience the Village and all it's colorful characters
The food is very nice and the atmosphere is full of personality
I was very pleased with my meal at the Yaffa Cafe
Not only is the place uniquely decorated with interesting background music, but the food is delicious, generous, and modestly priced
The desserts and hot specialty drinks are also something special! It's the perfect place to bring friends, out of towners, etc
There are plenty of conversation pieces!
I went with a friends and my 12 year old daughter
My daughter's pasta primavera was inedible
We looked under the undercooked pasta sauggy veggies to find about a pound of pine nuts soaking in oil
It almost had a Vicks' mentholated flavor
My fettucine alfredo was more like fettucine pudding
It tasted like rice pudding with noodles instead of rice
Would have made a better desset
It was sickeningly sweet
My friend's dinner was okay but cold
We told the waiter but he just walked away leaving us with the bill
We were told we would have to pay and take it up with the manager
I asked to speak to a manager but he was not there
I asked his name and later called but he never responded
Great, single mom splurges for a dinner out and wastes $40
Yaffas has been the place of choice for many a late night and starving outings
The place is interesting and the crowd is fun on most nights
Food is great and cheap, especially when you're craving breakfast foods at 3 in the morning!
which is a cheap eats place
Yeah, it is a E
Village staple, but it can be a bit unsanitary at times
I do, however, love the carrot ginger dressing, and the cordial staff
And you can't beat the value!
The food here is decent, and the carrot dressing is good, but I can get it at Dojo too (where the food is cheaper)
My main complaint about this place is space; it is SO CRAMPED! I am 58 and my friend is 62; we were sitting at a table for two and had to sit sideways because we felt so cramped
There are other cheap, good places I'd rather go to where I don't feel so uncomfortable physically
I have been going to the original Yaffa Caf in Tribeca since I was a little girl, and let me tell you, the East Village caf is a decided improvement
Not only is it as funky as the original, it's cleaner, better maintained and attracts a much hipper clientel

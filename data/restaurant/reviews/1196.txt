the service and the food was very good, and everybody was very nice

I was very impress by the food, the service

a mix of restaurant and lounge all in one
great asian food, very good sushi
The music was fun and a good mix
great looking hostesses
very refreshing for midtown after work or late night
great addition for midtown
The Scene Standing in stark contrast to St
Marks' numerous nondescript ethnic joints, Klong is a study in contemporary minimalist chic
After passing through a diminutive bar area where budget-minded scenesters gather for cheap drink specials, diners fill all corners of the dining room
Undulating light fixtures and shimmering pools ("klong" means canal in Thai) add to the trendy vibe
Harried waiters do their best to satiate the crowds by hurrying to and from the open kitchen in back
The Food It's hard not to be impressed with the affordability and breadth of Klong's menu, in which dozens of rice and noodle dishes can be prepared with any number of meats and fish
Colorful starters include crisp salmon spring rolls and meltingly tender, marinated spare ribs
Budget-minded diners should eschew pricier house specials (tea-smoked chicken, lychee duck) in favor of gargantuan plates of Pad Kee Mao (spicy basil noodles) and Massaman curry
For out of towners , this east village spot was lovely
The decor was lovely and we went there for lunch
service was prompt as was seating
there was so much on the menu that you could not go wrong, even for some of us who were veggies
it was truly delicious and right in the east village so you can walk up and down the streets and do some shopping if you so wish
This atmosphere of this place doesn't quite belong on St
Mark's: it's actually romantic and trendy
It's one of those places where you can tell they try to hire young, good looking hostesses/servers/bartenders
Their food is a medium portion presented on big flat plates
Even the curry
And the rice is shaped in two tiers and presented on a plate
But the prices are very St
Mark's
$8 for a curry dish with meat
$8 for sauteed noodles like pad thai and pad see ew
They have some unique creations, too
It's really tasty, too
They have a decent happy hour deal: 2 for 1 beers (I think $4 is the regular price)
A few of the other reviews have addressed this issue so I'll make this brief and to the point
This place is not for large groups (10+)
They enforce a $20/person minimum for groups of 10+ even for groups without reservations! I went with a party of 13 and they did not inform us about this policy until we were settled in our seats
It is a ridiculous policy as the entrees range from $8-$13 (and I'm not complaining about that) and appetizers range from $3-$5
If you're not of age and cannot buy drinks, it is almost impossible to reach the $20 minimum
And keep in mind this is $20 excluding tip and tax
The food was not top notch, but the portions are a decent size
The atmosphere is not exactly romantic as it can get quite loud during busy hours
One thing that bothered me about the entire restaurant was the lighting
Since when did dark mean romantic? This place seriously needs some lights
It's a problem when customers with 20/20 vision cannot read the menu because of bad lighting
In the end, our party spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he told us he would let us go this time but next time they would enforce the policy
This was probably because a crowd was growing outside and they wanted to get us out of the restaurant quickly
I was annoyed with what happened, and will definitely not be returning with a large group
I might return with a smaller group in the future though
I was recommended this restaurant from a friend back in San francisco
She told me it was the best thai food in nyc and I was not disappointed
I'm a big fan of pad thai but didn't know much else about thai food
this place blew my mind
Not only was the pad thai delicious, but i was introduced to new dishes that were amazing! I loved their Spicy Basil noodles-fantastic! Service is warm and friendly and the ambience is ideal for a date or friends
Weekends are busy, but definitely well worth it!
I was highly recommended this place from a couple of friends as the best thai place in nyc so I may have had high expectations the first time I tried and didn't like it
My soft-shell crab was soggy, thai ice tea way too sweet and coconut soup way too sour
Undeterred, I've went there again and was even more disappointed then the first time
Unfortunately I ventured in there for lunch and cheaper prices apparently mean 2nd degree freshness in this restaurant
Everything was either overcooked and bland (vegetables) or just simply not very fresh (seafood)
Service was hypnotically slow and if not for the hot waiters/waitresses I would have came out of this restaurant without one positive feedback whatsoever!
This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in NY, and I have tried others (such as Peep and Land) that are highly rated
The food is consistently good
Basil noodles are the best! Went with a group of four and we each only spent about $25 each, which included appetizers, wine, and dessert
The other plus is that they take reservations: many NY restaurants in this price range won't
This place is unbelievable!! The food is fantastic, try some of their specials like Klong Padthai and Soft Shell Crabs - absolute heaven! they have great Happy Hours everyday - check their website for more info
Their cocktails are yummy and only 5$ during Happy Hour! I usually go on Tuesday night - Happy Hour all night long!!! Service is great, the waiters are so sweet and attentive
Best of all, the prices are unbelievable
We went in with a group of 5 - plenty of drinks and food, we were stuffed! Came to less than 100$ with tip!! You couldn't ask for a better package
love love love this place!
Went to Klong on a Friday night and was told the wait would be 45 minutes
An hour and a half later we were seated
But the food was fantastic!!! I would highly reccomend this place for a date or if you just want good food and drinks, just be prepared to wait
went there on a friday night
it was unbelievably packed
even though we were late for our reservation, they still managed to seat us in a hurry
the service was great and the food was fantastic
we ordered alot and when i got the bill, i was surprised at just how low the prices were
it was unbeleivable for the value
especially considering it was around st
marks
a great place to have a date as there's plenty to do around there for afterward
I love the food that comes out of this restaurant
What I don't like is the long delivery times
Doesn't matter what time of day it is, delivery always takes 45 minutes MINIMUM
As I write this review, I have been waiting now for exactly 1 HOUR and, what do you know, my doorbell just bell just rang
If u love tai food, u have to go there
Not all the dishes are spicy
Appetizers are amazing, you have to try the grilled squid legs
they are soooooooo good and not expensive at all
And for those who falls for the tom YUm soup, have to try it
Is not as expensive as da ones in other restaurants and it is good!!
when i say cheap, it's not that cheap, but it's worthed! not pricy, but with the kind of food they're serving, it's a great deal! crispy duck salad is super awesome,  pad kee mow the best i've ever tried (i haven't been to thailand that is
) herbal tea chicken (in their special) for god sake, you all have to try it! the best! calamari is awesome,  padthai is great
gosh, i'm practically listing the whole menu here
(there were 6 of us when we went there
so 6 different entrees)  they have a lot of cool cocktail drinks too, one i tried, one night in bangkok, is really good!  overall, you really should try this place,  atmosphere is great for dates, hangout with friends, music is not that loud, and the interior is really sophisticated
if you go to the restroom, pay attention to the Buddha, it's really cool!

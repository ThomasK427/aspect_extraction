For dessert I recommend the Brownie Coupe, it's delicious, and it's the biggest dessert they serve
Everything else is tiny and not too great
The Mango Chutney pork chop is delicious, as is the Escargot
They have a great selection of wines, and the mixed drinks don't dissapoint
This place is perfect for a night late night out with friends
Don't sit by the door in the winter, you'll freeze
This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants! Everything I've ever ordered here (and I go here a lot) is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced
Entrees range from 10-20 dollars and I feel the food is comparable to what I've paid 25-30 for elsewhere
There is one snippy waiter (which may be who the other reviewer referrs to) but all the other waiters/waitresses are attentive
They also have an excellant weekend brunch
i was excited to try this place for dinner, as it had been highly rated, and because i knew i liked the ambience
unfortunately, i was disappointed on all counts
we paid high prices for mediocre food (salad was not fresh, steak undercooked, questionable mussels) and unsatisfactory service
the place was not busy when we were there, but it was very difficult to get our waiter to the table
whenever we did, he didn't find it necessary to look at us while we ordered
we weren't very needy, just the usual--order, deliver food, deliver check
and as a side note, for a place that draws a rather small crowd, i wouldn't have expected their drinks to be so expensive ($8 for all mixed)
you could do better elsewhere
One of my favorite NYC dessert and coffee spots
Its open 24/7 which makes it perfect for late nite 'battery recharging'
I absolutely *love* their warm chocolate cake and all their mocha varieties are great
Its not badly priced either
I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Europe and its style of coffee and dessert get-a-ways
Good consistent food a few notches above diner food with diner food prices, the ambience tends towards the dark even during the day
The waitstaff is friendly, can be crowded on weekends
Good place to go by oneself or with a group of friends
I came here with a date on Saturday night for some after dinner dessert and really enjoyed it
The soft lighting and quiet setting made it ideal for conversation
Thumbs up for me
The place has several different atmospheres depending on when you go
Brunch is very hectic but the hostesses do a good job of trying to keep things in order
Needs more space to wait in though
At during weeknights, the place is pretty laidback and romantic and on weekends, it is jumping the whole night even at 4 am after clubbing! The bartenders are great and all of the wait staff that I've seen are added bonuses
:-)
The burger and fries were great! Being on Chelsea Piers, you also get a great view of the Hudson River--plus some eye candy at times!
Forget what others have said
This is NY's best burger
Service can be unbelievably slow, considering it's never very crowded
But a jalapeno jack burger and a corona on the pier fron--what more could you ask for? Just make sure you get your burger medium at least
Rare means rare here
The Scene  It's easy to forget you're in Tribeca in this charming, countrified space, dominated by a dark wood bar and booths
The room is high-ceilinged but cozy, with Tintin prints and memorabilia brightening every corner
Francophone waitstaff add a certain je-ne-sais-quoi to the ambiance
The Food  Belgium knows a thing or two about delicious food, and Petite Abeille offers solid versions of some national classics
Everything on the menu is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer-and-bacon, creamy mushroom, or white-wine-and-garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes, to a juicy croque-monsieur, and beyond
The pommes frites are top-notch, and there's an impressive array of Belgian beers to pair with your meal
Desserts, by and large, are missable, but chances are you won't have room left anyway
Petite Abeille has so many great things about it
great hot chocolate, the fries are pretty good, burgers are always a good thing and great beer selection
Apple pie also is wonderful
However, for all the great reviews, there is nothing that really pops out
I have had the roast chicken (gross), the specials sound better than they taste, the steak au poivre is good but sometimes boring
I think the menu needs an update because I just don't know what to order anymore
This is really a cute place and a great bargain
Mussels are good, beer selection is very good and for some reason the mac-n-cheese is terrific
I am yet to find better in nyc
Been there quite a few times and admittedly have to say dinner menu seems to impress more than the brunch one
Definitely a great neighborhood choice and a lot more bang for for your buck than Odeon across the street
I think the chef's kids were even eating in a table in the back one Friday night - which just seemed to add to the cuteness
The other night, I ordered a hamburger and my girlfriend ordered mussels not a hard combination
The hamburger showed up long before the mussels, and the waiter suggested I start eating because he didnt want my food to get cold
Before I could ask why they didnt come out at the same time, he said theyre boiling
Is it impossible to boil mussels while a hamburger is cooking?   When the mussels came, they were small and tough
(Just for the record my hamburger was over cooked
) At the end of the meal I told the manager I was dissatisfied
He offered to take some money off the bill
Instead I told him Id simply find another place to eat in the future
There are so many good places nearby
Good wholesome food, some of the best french fries (or should that be Belgian fries?) in New York and great, friendly service
What more could you want?  This place is great anytime - for a quick early evening drink with an appetizer - such as their excellent mussels - or for a full meal with wine
The atmosphere is relaxed and non-pretentious - almost cosy
And in the summer, they have outdoor seating, so you can relax on a warm evening and watch the world go by as you order yet another pint of Stella to toast Petite Abeille
perfect for brunch
yummy omelettes and their waffles are to die for!
I went for lunch during a weekday so business was steady but the restaurant wasn't crowded
The space was charming and comfortable
The chicken stew was served in a heavy mushroom sauce with a side of fries
It was filling and delicious
You could easily get a sandwich lunch for less than $7, but the other entrees are around $13
I thought the flat-screen TV behind the bar was a little out of place, but not too loud or distracting
I used to go to the Petite Abeille on 14th street, which I highly recommended to several friends
Now that it has been closed, I tried this one on W Broadway: bad idea
The mussels are not even close to the ones that they used to serve on 14th street and the service
after havinng being really sloppy all night and having forgotten about our orders at least twice, the waitress complained that her tip was 3 dollars short of 15% and she told me it would have been very rude of me not to add them to my credit card charge!!!!
The food is always reliably remarkably tasty!!!! Even the non-Belgian dishes are delicous
Petite ABeille's brunch is one to remember from the waffles with exotic fruit, french toast, eggs benedict and even the coffee!!!! I love this little chain of restaurants
The ambience on Thursday night (Lobster Night) is a lot of fun!
This is the finest installment in the small La Petite Abeille chain
Tintin and checked tablecloths still feature heavily but this continental-style bistro borders on classy
The food is reliably excellent
Eggs Benedict and freshly made waffles make a superb brunch
Moreover, you have the choice of a few dozen Belgian ales (a few of them on tap)
There's a small bar area, so you can skip the meal and concentrate on the fantastic beers
The service is very friendly, but notoriously inefficient
I'd budget one forgotten order per visit
If you can take that in good humour you'll keep coming back to this charming place
Best French Toasts and gaufres
Diner food good but nothing exceptionnal
Welcoming staff
My wife and I had brunch here with another couple on a Sunday morning

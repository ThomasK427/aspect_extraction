Good fried potatoes, delicious spinach
A very pretty room, and a nice addition overall to the neighborhood
Thankfully, this is a place that is as much about people-watching as it is about serious meat consumption
This place definitely wins a place on my local restaurant rotation, for when I'm just hanging out casually with friends or my boyfriend
Only drawback: seating is rather closely placed--the kind of eatery where you need to shield your wine glass with your hands when the woman at the next table gets up to use the bathroom
Had dinner there last night started with a delicious 10 ounce martini, cold
Great bread which I used for scooping uo my juicy perfectly cooked Fois Gras with two sauces
Followed with a great clean exremely fresh piece of Halibut with a soy ginger sauce and my choice of potato dauphinois with a glass of Pinot Noir
Too full for dessert but one of the best meals Ive had in a while and I like my commida
I didn't know what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised
The food was excellent, cooked exactly as requested
The service was also superb, very friendly and helpful
A fun, casual and very nice atmosphere in the restaurant
Excellent place for a few drinks with friends or a nice dinner for two
Try the sauces with the steak-- they are delicious
Also, the creamed spinach is among the best I've ever had
The desserts are also delicious, so save some room
I live arond the corner from Carne and am very excited about it's arrival
However, I think I;ll wait awhile before I return
My steak was ok I think I got the fatty piece they couldn't sell
and my boyfriends was barely cooked although he asked for it med
well
The vegetable selection is a bit weak especially the mushrooms which turned out to be a big mushy mash
stick to the potatoes they were yummy!
I have been to Carne twice
Once just for late night drinks (they have a great drink menu) and then again for dinner
Dinner was very good, especially considering the reasonable prices
There is a communal table in the middle of the restaurant that looked like fun
It was a very nice romantic dinner but I wasn't impressed or wow'ed by the food, staff or decor
I've definitely had better for less
Save this spot for Restaurant Week but not worth full price
we were very impressed by the food at Atelier -- however we thought the service was extremely weak- -- our waiters and most of the staff waiters seemed to be most impressed with the table next to ours and so consequently we got short changed - also we both sent our drinks back to the bar because they were not what we ordered -- just an old-fashion and a manhatten -- they had no clue
wine steward was refreshing and helpful tho --we were pleased with her service
the rest of the staff needs to be more attentive for a so-called first rate restaurant
Atelier is one of the classiest hotel restaurants in town
The food is divine, the service is perfect, the wines are plentiful
The rooms are elegant and comfortable, with an inviting lounge ideal for reclining with a glass and a cheese plate
The super-cool wine director is always around with something wonderful to offer a taste of
Not only that, but the adjoining bar is a taste of true old-world New York, complete with the best bartender in town
The food is not really authentic French, it's more like french with an American flare
The food was very delicious, and there was so much of it! The service was outstanding
Our waiters were not snoby at all, and me and my mother, who have certainly never dined at a Ritz Carlton or any other resturaunt of the kind, were treated with utmost respect and our questions were graciously answered
The tasting menu containing 6 courses was a little more than $100
In the end we spent $240 on the two of us, without ordering wine
It's obvious it's restaurant in a hotel, with its absolute quietness and no other entrance other than passing through the Ritz lobby
Because of it, it feels somewhat exclusive for hotel guests (which is not its purpose)
I went for business lunch
The quietness actually helped our conversations because I didn't have to raise my voice to get heard
Service was very attentive even though we felt food could have come out faster
Food quality is delicate with attention to details
All in all, a quite unusual spot for dining in midtown but it was a positive experience
We recently had dinner for 16 for our Wesminster Dog Show friends and they gave us the whole back part of the resturaunt
The service was well timed and the food was good
To top it all off hotel car saved us an $8 cab ride
Room is cozy but a bit stuffy
Walnut soup was excellent but the crawfisth appetizer was a bit overpowering
Lamb rack was super and reminded me of Jean Georges
The Salmon was only fair as the horseradish crust was barely detectable and salmon was not particularly tasty
Desserts were unimpressive
Cheese course was yummy
Service was good until we ordered a 1/2 bottle of wine and then treated us like yahoos
Simply put, Atelier delivers
If you go expecting a fine mean with nice wines and EXCELLENT service, you will likely not be disappointed
The menu is very interesting and diverse, the wine list extensive, the room is pleasant, and the staff is extremely attentive and friendly
In addition, the cheese cart from Murray's Cheese Shop is worth the supplement if you are a cheese fan
Clearly Chef Kreuther is very talented
The only thing we missed was a tableside appearance, but clearly he was taking care of things in the kitchen
One warning
Quite expensive, but the experience is worth it
WOW!! The spring tasting menu was incredible and we were treated like royalty
This rated as possibly one of the finest meals I have ever had anywhere - it was that good on that night
They showered us with desserts and cookies, after our 7 course tasting
Reeling with delight - comes with a price
We replaced the squab with the lamb, and that was one of the most interesting and delicious dishes -stuffed with foie gras and almost fried in a crust - incroyable! The cod was superb and the mushrooms and crawfish in a crock topped with crust was sublime
Want to return for the Fall Tasting!!
An exceptional culinary experience
felt like we were seated on a stage and participating in a master performance orchestrated by someone who knows how to provoke all the senses
The wine steward also made terrific recommendations
Dining room needs more visual spice
I had eaten here a few weeeks ago and it was a treat
Yes it was expensive but you get what you pay for
I had the tasting menu which was great - the food just kept coming and coming and it was all delicious
The service was great too, not to mention the vast wine collection they stock
If you have the money, would definitely recommend
Had a fabulous Christmas dinner here
Every course was exquisite: cocoa bean soup with truffle and crab, lobster with fresh herbs, venison with chestnut spaetzle, and a pear poached in red wine with walnut ice cream
As I was the only one drinking, I had lovely (and more than reasonably priced) wines by the glass
I've dined in some of the country's poshest restaurants--this was easily one of my top 10 experiences, and, in fact, the best in years! My last high-end experience (Fifth Floor in SF, CA) cost the same amount of money ($200/person), but did not leave a lasting (tasty) impression
Atelier is one of the top restaurants in NYC
Very pretty room, tables well spaced and comfortable, mood subdued and very upscale, service outstanding from beginning to end
In back of the new Ritz Carlton's lobby and a world unto itself
Food is also great if, at times, I thought a touch bland on a few dishes (I may have ordered wrong)
Good wine list and excellent desserts
A place to relax and be pampered
Atelier is without any doubt the best neo-french restaurant to set foot in new york city
Its lavish decor and impeccable waiting staff, make for the best and memorable dining experience
Its dishes beginning with chef Gabrielle kreuther's magnificent rabitt de terrine and ending it with the delicious desserts by pastry chef jean francois, it catapults your dining experience to a higher karma
The wine list is as extensive as it is the master sommellier's knowledge in wines; where recommended try the california chardonnays (it is where you can see it is his forte)
Atelier is the new sensation
Went there last night for my girlfriend's 21st birthday, relying only on Citysearch reviews since Zagat has no review on it (too new - restaurant only opened a few months ago)

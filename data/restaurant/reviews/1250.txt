The Scene A touch of the French Quarter inspires this New Orleans-themed restaurant
Wooden floors and stately coffee bar gleam under the lamp-light with plants lining the small unused balcony
Tables are widely spaced, and service is friendly but inefficient
The Food To get a classic po'boy, you'll have to stop by for lunch or brunch, when salads, muffuletta and pressed sandwiches are served
For dinner, spicy shrimp and turbid gumbo work as typical, though not innovative, Southern appetizers, while cornbread is of the sweet, cakier variety
The fried chicken showcases the kitchen at its best; its thin perfectly crisped skin conceals a moist, succulent bird
Entrees don't always come as advertised--sometimes missing a promised ingredient
The talapia filet sits in a delicate sauce and salty short ribs deliver tenderness, albeit without the expected deep flavor
Order up a cafe au lait with chicory instead of ho-hum desserts like sweet potato pie or beignets
Stan's is so fantastic, I had my wedding there
A year and half ago, my husband I went to Stan's for a Muffaletta and a cup of Gumbo, and from that moment on we knew we were addicted
We absolutely think Stan's is the best restaurant in Brooklyn, the food is fantastic, the ambiance is relaxed and romantic and the service is always friendly and wonderful
Our Wedding was such a memorable day that we will never forget
Our many thanks to Stan, Ola, the great wait staff and of course the chef
Charming place and great food
Ive had several meals at Stans and theyve all been consistently good
The dcor is relaxing; lots of plants and sponged yellow walls that make you feel like youre in New Orleans instead of on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn
Soft-shell crab in season is a standout and all of the oyster dishes are exceptional
Ive taken my mother who lives in Harlem and now whenever she visits, she insists on eating at Stans
Every time I visit NY, I visit Stan's to get a perfect meal
The food is consistently perfect
BYOB
Stans place has a charm you can't find anywhere else on this side of the Atlantic (Avenue that is)
Since I live in downtown Brooklyn, Im always on the lookout for unique, chick, and affordable places to go for an intimate dinner with my boyfriend or a leisure brunch with friends
Im so happy Ive had the opportunity to eat at Stans place
It has already become a group favorite with my friends and I! We cant get enough of the Banana Frosted Pancakes, the Soft Shell Crab or their famous lightly frosted Beignets! On our first visit, we were sad to learn that they have a BYOB policy, but by our second visit, we brought our own bottle, and we were not charged a corking fee! The super friendly staff, the ambience (a plant outlined Mezzanine) and the great food have made my experiences at Stans Place a great one! We are all looking forward to when they get their wine and beer license (in a couple of weeks time, according to the staff)
We had a party of 5 for lunch
Initially, we were lured in thinking it possessed some charm but were proven wrong very quickly
The fruit meringue ordered, by 3 of the 5 in our party, had gone bad, but the servers were unwilling to admit so and brought the owner out who agreed to disagree
Very soon after, service went downhill
Food was at best, mediocre and when the bill finally came they had nerve to add on 20% gratuity even though there was nothing stated on the menu or anywhere that gratuity was included for a party of 5 (usually a party of 6 is gratuity inclusive)
When disputed they were defensive and nasty
I would never return
After hearing about this somewhat new place I thought Id try it out
Overall the food was decent but it didnt remind me of the food I had on vacation in New Orleans a few years ago
Although The decor of the place was beautiful
The food took WAY TOO LONG and the server was very slow
Perhaps I'd give it another try but that isnt likely
We stumbled upon Stan's Place this week and the prix fixe Tuesday through Thursday is a great deal
$25 for soup (good gumbo) or salad, an entree (southern fried chicken and lamb shank are great picks) and dessert (sweet potato crumble is a MUST!)
The live bass musician was excellent
One of the better restaurants in this area
The food here is really great
Their Po Boys are amazing, the live music is phenomenal, great desserts and coffee that give Starbuck's a run for their money
Wonderful twist on some New orleans favorites
Food was very good, waitresses extremely accomidating, but service a little slow
There is no liquor license but we did get free glasses of wine and you can also bring your own
Crawfish pie, red snapper and bread pudding are great! Paid about $25
00 perperson
Coffee with chicory is some of the finest I have had
Small Menu at night, but the brunch and lunch menus are much bigger and look very appetizing
Will be going back to try the po'boys
Closed on Mondays
Highly recommend and hope everyone gives them a try, they won't be sorry
Be nice to yourself and go to Stan's Place
Food, service, environment, everything is excellent!
There are very few places in lower Westchester that have the type of ambiance that many of us who frequent NYC admire, but Ripe met my desires with their food and atmosphere
I now have someplace to hang out and dine close to home
The food was oh-so-good-i-can-eat-another-plate-of that
Cozy place with excellect food and drinks and fun staff
Caribean food high class
Have outdoor dining in the summer
I would reccomend this place to anyone -- it's family friendly and party friendly
:)
The place is beautiful but the service is not that good
people are really nice and its true they are often short on ingridients
This seems like something very common with the restayurants around thearea
This place could do a lot better if
1
faster service 2
employees not fighting with each other in front of clients 3 having ALL the ingredients for the meals they have on there menue
I ordered a salad told they had no lettuce
I then ordered a Tapas plate and told they did not have the chesse and olives
I then ordered a dessert and was told that none of the desserts on the menu are avail
The Mexican coffee with tequila and amaretto is awesome
definately recommended
Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a weekend night
Service was inexcusably, excruciatingly slow- it took more than 30 min to get the first round of drinks, by which point our party was ready to walk out
it appears there are only 2 waiters in charge of serving the entire restaurant
the waiter was friendly enough, and even admitted the service was slow because it was busy, but taking up to an hour to get served two cocktails was not very amusing
we weren't the only table that was demonstrably annoyed with the poor service - seems it's a recurring problem here
unless you have plenty of time or want to spend the whole night looking for the waiter, go to another place -there are plenty of other restaurants in the neighborhood
This is a great place with good value brunch
There is a lovely garden out back and the service is friendly
The crepes are tasty with fresh ingredients and a bit different for brunch
The Preview Bobby Flay has taken over the old Judson Grill space for his third NYC restaurant
This time Flay is exploring American regional cuisines, though his loyal flock will find his signature Southwestern dishes among them
David Rockwell designed the 200-seat dining room and bar with an "updated brasserie" feel
Ate here for the first time just last night, and I must say that every single aspect of the meal was impressive
From the butter and cornbread to the shellfish sampler to the lamb to the rhubarb/Zinfandel crepes to the selection of Vermont cheeses, each dish was packed with flavor and extremely well-prepared and balanced
The wine list was very fairly priced and had a good ratio of solid crowdpleasing labels to some very interesting offerings
I had no service issues at all, unlike many of the member reviews recently
The hostess was delightful, first of all
My server was very polite and personable, very attentive, etc, and his back up staff was as well
In fact, one of them, when I told him to compliment the Chef, offered to introduce us
Hansen was his name, and I was happy for the opportunity to personally thank the man who'd provided me with one of the best meals I've ever had, and being in the restaurant management field for years here in NYC, there's a lot of competition
They definitely have a new regular
Contrary to what some of these reviewers have to say, I have been to Bar Americain twice now and have enjoyed both the dinner and the brunch
The service, food, and cocktails were all equally great!! I highly recommend the flapjacks for brunch, the shellfish trio and ham tasting appetizer, potato chips with blue cheese sauce, and most importantly the Caramel Whiskey Eclairs!! I love this place and will definitely continue to go back
Highly Recommended!!!

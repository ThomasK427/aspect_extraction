im not sure it there was supposed to be a several varieties of oysters, but they all appeared to be the same to me
the oysters were ok though fresh and cold, they werent very plump, so i found them slightly disappointing
i ordered the crab cake sandwich ($15, which the waitress said is very good) and my bf got the open face soft shell crab sandwich ($16)
my crab cake sandwich came with some spicy mayonnaise
there were genuine lumps of crab in there, and it was lightly breaded and fried very satisfying
the soft shell crab sandwich was basically an entire fried crab, drizzled with blue cheese, atop a hunk of vinaigrette-dipped soft bread
it was also really good, and came with a small pile of roasted tomatoes
for dessert, we split the chocolate chip souffl a la mode ($10)
it was more like a hot chocolate chip cake than a souffl, since it was very dense, but it was a good end to the meal nonetheless
the vanilla ice cream helped to mitigate the sweetness of the souffl
it was really big, and perfect for sharing
overall, i had a really good experience and would come back on a nice day
While the food is great, the bartendars are top-notch and the location is great on the water
the crowd overshadows all of that
Looking for a group of cocky men who tend to take off the rings and pounce on the pretty little things looking for a sugar daddy- then you will feel right at home
Let's put it this way- anything you have ever heard about the financial district and the men that work there
is all personified in the crowd at PJ Clarkes
Your best bet is a quiet Tuesday or Wednesday, or a weekend where you can sit outside and enjoy the Marina
I traveled a lot and, among other places, I have been many times in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and in Italy
But, if you live in New York, you don't need to travel so much in order to find excellent Italian and Brazilian food
Samba-le is truly a unique experience to try Brazilian and Italian (with an exotic touch) food
Everything I tried was wonderful, but in particular my friends and I enjoyed the gnudi, the tapas and a wonderful steak (Brazilian picanha), without forgetting the excellent Italian and Brazilian wines, the caipirinhas and the sangrias (8 different kinds!) I highly recommend Samba-le, also for the cozy athmosphere
And during the weekends I enjoyed an inspiring live music
Brazilian-Italian fusion: this is something new for New York
And unexpected
We read good ratings on Citysearch and we tried it
It was truly a great experience
The food was excellent
Not to mention the wonderful sangrias (7 different flavors!) and caipirinhas
Plus a very romantic ambiance and a very attentive service
We highly recommend it and
I was about to forget: ask for the manager/owner Patrick: a very, very nice young guy! He will do everything to please you, as he did for us
We celebrated the birthday of a friend of mine
We were a party of 25
Never have we experienced before such excellent food, courteous service, cozy and romantic ambiance
I would recommend it to everybody
We found Samba-le through Citysearch, and I must admit that it is rightly rated as one of the top restaurants in New York
We went there again, only two of us, on a Friday and we had the same wonderful experience, with on top live music
Great!
Having heard great things about Samba-le, I decided to give it a go for my 40th birthday celebration
I made a great choice
The samba lesson gave me a good workout, the mango sangria cooled me off, the appetizers made me smile (try the fried spheres of something or other - they are yummy!!), and the atmosphere was cozy! The indoor/outdoor seating was perfect for the smokers among us and great for socializing
Handsome manager Patrick kindly checked on our party, and later treated my friend and I to a birthday drink
The cute bartender was super nice, easy going and made a mean tasty coconut caipirinha
Great ambiance, tasty drinks and bites, good service no attitude
What more can you ask for??? I will certainly be back
This is my summer spot
Make it yours!!!
What a find
Very cozy, romantic, tropical feel
Moderate prices, flowing sangria
Bruschetta with avocado and brie cheese is amazing!!  Spicy sausages are yummy!!! Great staff (all Brazilian) Makes me want to go to Rio tonight
I went to Samba le for the first time last week and I was really impressed
Great sangrias (try the Strawberry one, its delicious)
Prices were cheap and great food
We had the coconut shrimp stew, the pasta with sausages and the scallops: loved it
And, oh yes, the Manager Patrick is very cute (hope he does not read this
)!!!
I have been going since they opened
The food is amazing (try the ribs and the lasagna) and the music is incredible
I even spent my birthday there! Loved it and will keep going back
Been going to Samba le for past 2 months
GREAT SPOT
Its a lot of fun and the food was delicious
Prices are OK, Coconut mojitos are additictive
Patrick is a very charming manager, and staff very attentive
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
Not only the excellent food, the the great service, the fabulous cozy decor, but also live music, free samba lessons and wonderful caipirinhas and sangrias (6 different types!) Samba-le has been one of my best experiences in food and fun in New York!
We were a party of ten last week and it came out the best experience we ever had in Manhattan: not only for the fantastic Brazilian-Italian food, for the decor, the service, the music but also for the wonderful owner
Patrick is not only very attentive, graceful and professional, but he is also a
very handsome young guy! Great experience
I recommend Samba-le' to everybody who loves excellent food, great ambiance and fun
And: the prices are very reasonable! Sofia I forgot: they serve 5 different types of wonderful sangria!
I would have to say that Samba Le is definitely one of my favorite restaurants around
Food is great , atmosphere is cozy and fun with very good music in the background , the staff and manager are extremely friendly and cocktails are definitely a MUST I would recommend , since the place is not too big, that if you are a big group you'd book in advance
The location is perfect for bday parties
We got there with no reservation ( 6 pax) and were promptly seated despite it being a very busy night
the Staff definitely goes out of their way to make you feel at ease
And last but not least FOOD is excellent
You can try all the different Tapas, or the revisisted Italian diswches like the excellent chocolate pasta!
The food was delicious, the sangria better and the samba, well
sinful
The owner, Hola Patricio!, was incredibly attentive, as was the waitstaff
Our group grew in number and they accomodated us
The atmosphere was homey, intimate, sexy
Nice date spot
The live music was incredible - stirred us up to serious bootie shakin' like we hadn't in a long, long time
Can't wait to go back to try Monday night samba lessons tastings
Many thanks to the Samba Le staff for an unexpectedly fabulous night!
It's 3 days after my first Samba-Le meal and I'm still thinking about the delicious ribs, sweet sangria, and the inviting Brazilian hospitality
Initially drawn in by the bright awning, trimmed with rainbow stained-glass, Samba-Le's charm rescued our group of 5 from a 90-minute wait for a table at an over-stuffed enclave of the second street variety
A few caprihanas, small plates, and bites of birthday cake later, we were hard pressed to leave what turned out to be a charming celebration of my friends' 24th birthdays
Bid adieu by sultry samba music, we resolved to return again for the good service and better prices
I stumbled upon this place while waiting 1
5 hours to be seated at over-rated restaurant nearby
My party and I actually just stopped in to have a drink, and thankfully ended up staying for dinner
The Sangria is to die for, and the food is even better
The service is attentive and friendly, more than I can say for 90% of the restaurants in Manhattan
The Owner was even attentive checking in frequently to ensure that our experience was wonderful
The music was a delightful departure from the norm, and added to the superior ambience

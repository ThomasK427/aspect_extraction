I liked the fact that there's few adornments hanging on the walls
This place is all about the food, baby!  Simply, this is amoung the top 3 restaurants in Brooklyn and in the top 15 in all of NYC
What it may lack in atmosphere, it makes up in flavors that are clean, fresh, and innovative
A wonderful meal, and a good value for what is delivers
Bravo!
The Grocery is by far the best restaurant on a very good restaurant row - Smith Street in Carroll Gardens
You just have to talk the (kinda) weird owner into giving you a table
We needed four for 8:30, and he'd only give us 7:30 (too early) or 9 (late) cuz it's small - although when that hour arrived, there were two empty tables
Go figure
If you can get past this, you will have a fabulous meal
Pricier than most of Brooklyn, but well worth it
I went to the grocery after reading many good reviews about it however, I was a bit diappointed
The restaurant was about the size of a walk-in-closet and the tables were way too close for comfort
The grey walls with no pictures or color were dismal
For apps, we had the scallops which were good but the ravioli that came with them were bland
In addition, I ordered the fluke fish with spinach and the entire dish was BLAND - it had no flavor
Luckily, my husband ordered the beef stew and shared
On a positive note, they did have good dessert - we both had the brownie dessert with hazelnut chocolate chip icecream which was yummy
However, the restaurant is nothing special and and the food is hit or miss - perhaps the chef should tend more to his main dishes rather than mingling with the customers
The scallops app needs work but the entrees were well developed and cooked
Wine selection rates well on value and quality
After all the hype about Grocery, I was expecting a fairly tasteless experience
The food was superb though - from app's to dessert, it was done perfectly
The staff and room could use an uplift of some sort, both were kind of boring and not too much fun to be around
Good place to have an intimate conversation with people, not good for celebrating of any sort
Nice outdoor seating, high quality food
Don't skip the appetizers, they're the best part of the menu
The atmosphere here is so uptight! I ordered the (delicious) grilled trout and my husband had the duck
He asked the waitress for a sharp knife before tucking into his dinner
Moments later the chef came out and slammed a steak knife down on the table, huffily saying that if it was necessary then he should buy us dinner
The knife really wasn't necesary, but the chef's hissy fit was absurd
Our waitress forgot the amuse bouche until after the appetizer and brought bread after the entree arrived
When my b'day dessert came out, the waitress furtively brought out a cobbler w/ a candle in it, whispered happy b'day and scuttled away
wierd and pretty hilarious
We just bought a house in Cobble Hill and might have returned, but it's just too tense and crowded and there are lots of other excellent restaurants on Smith Street sans the freaky atmosphere!
I too can't understand why this restaurant has received such high marks not only by citysearch but zagat
appetizers were the only memorable and delicious part of the meal
my lamb came and it was cold
the waiter informed us that the meat should be at room temp but there was no heat at all
what does room temp mean? the air-conditioning was running so is that the room temp? desserts -- panna cota was perfecto! service was ok, not great just ok
the one thing i did enjoy was how the chef and his sous chef would often come out running food or clearing dishes or delivering wine glasses
it was nice to see the community effort without any ego
Forget about all of the downtown restaurants with their attitude, out of this world prices, and head chefs who are only occasionally in the kitchen, and go to Grocery, where the food is reasonably priced, the service is superb and the food is delicious
Don't miss out on this Amazing Restaurant!
I hear of this place from 1010Win, and brought some friends to check it out
We actually have a hard time locating the place
They need a bigger sign! The food is amazing, and it's really worth the wait
They have a very simple menu, and we almost try all the specials they have
Ask to be seated at the garden; it's very romantic and relaxing
The chief personally greet all the guests, now thats something you don't expect in NYC
It cost almost nothing; half compare those iffy places on SOHO
The food makes wonderful use of seasonal ingredients, using the highest quality produce and meat available, then threating those ingredients with care
On my trip, I had a beautiful octopus salad, not overseasoned, followed by a moist duck breast
When the restaurant opened, there were some problems with flighty service and an inefficient kitchen
I'm happy to report that the problems have been resolved, and everything is now friendly and professional
Smith Street has more than its share of foodie joints, but this one is top notch--the offerings change frequently and are based on seasonal veggies
Go often!
The Scene Peach-toned walls, large windows, an ice-packed shellfish bar, and lots of open floor space contribute to another winning venue from the Italian tag team of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich
The smart staff is especially colorful, as goatees, exposed necklaces, chain-link bracelets and ponytailed blond hair abound
The Food Intense, pristine flavors are as uplifting as any stomping Broadway musical a few blocks away
Flavors burst forth from every dish; seafood is so fresh you'd think that the owners had their own trawler moored nearby
Start with either the terrific grilled octopus with white beans, or a homey salad featuring poached salt cod, wild mushrooms and potatoes
Pastas soar as well, especially the rich and briny maccheroni holding big chunks of lobster meat and flavored with sea urchin
No trip to Esca would be complete without the crudo tasting, a medley of raw fish preparations that play out like an Italian version of sashimi
Some places can get away with horrible service if the food is great, but at Esca, the service was thin, hurried and rude
The hot food was cold and the chilled food was room temp
I don't know about you, but I like my raw bar items cold, not warm and slimy
Sadly, the more patient we were, the more we were ignored
When we finally asked to speak with someone, the hostess came over and was rude
I had heard a few good things about this place and have never been more disappointed
With so many other great choices in the city, why waste your time and money?
We were seated in an alcove at a small table for two next to a very loud table of four
Overall noise level in the restaurant was about equal to that of a rock concert gone bad
(Wooden floors didn't help)
Wine steward recommended a bottle of wine priced 50% more than the range I gave him (a very valid range because on the second try he picked a perfectly acceptabe bottle within the range)
We had three courses and were done within 1 1/2 hours - not rushed but also not leisurely
Not recommended for a romantic dinner
Food quality was ok
Appetizers (Ahi Tuna and White anchoives were tasteless
Main course was small portions but tasty (Black Cod and Mahi Mahi)
Desert (chocolate cake) was superb
The cuisine at Esca is incredibly suberb
The presentation and quality of the crudo selections were mind blowing, and my date and I were delighted with the various selections that the chef had created for the evening
To make the night even more delightful was the service
Our waitress, Mitzy, was extremely hospitable
She made excellent recommendations without making us feel intimidated by the menu
We dine quite often and it is nice to find a place where the food lives up to its expectations and the service takes it a leap beyond the typical robotic smiles that adorn other waiters in nyc
The crudo appetizer (various types of raw seafood) sampler was unbelievable--six separate courses--all EXQUISITELY presented and flavored ending with a rare taste of sea urchin
Reservations are essential indoors or out but you can almost always get an early seat at the unique ice-filled raw bar where the greatest bartender dispenses volumes of knowledgable friendly chatter and perfectly matched wines as well as oysters
Be prepared: only two non-seafood items on the menu
Don't pass up the desserts! One sour note: the sommelier suggested our $100 bottle of wine and then opened it and served the first taste to someone he knew seated next to us
Both the food and atmosphere were so good, we soon got over it
Esca is the type of restaurant one expects in NYC
It's not a hip LES joint, or a dark, quiet West Village Bistro
It's an elegant, well-done Mario restaurant where the food is consistently great, and ideas such as service and ambience are so given that to ask about them is laughable
It is not a cozy restaurant--not a good first date place, unless you REALLY have to try hard
It's a place to bring someone to show them that,  a
you want to share a great meal with them and, b
you know your stuff when it comes to food and wine
I've had great experiences at both Po and Babbo, so I expected good things from this place

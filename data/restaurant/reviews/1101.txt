not to mention, barely dressed
She told us that we couldn't make a reservation until after 6pm and then at 6:45pm told us that there were no tables when the place was empty
We knew this because we called for a reservation while sitting at the bar! Obviously, the hostess did not find the humor in this
Next, the kind bartender went and told the owners we were having problems
The hostess finally seated us at a table for two when there were three of us in an empty restaurant
That was the last straw
We were out of there and headed to Dos Caminos where they prompty seated us and treated us with respect
Don't bother with Ixta
it probably won't be open that much longer anyway
went there off the NY Times write-up were pleaseantly surprised as everyone was very attentive service was great
calamari salad appetizer was great and very different (it had banana slices) mixed in with glazed walnuts calamari on a bed of lettuce, very very tasty
i liked that my waiter talked me out of getting the steak, he said you know go with the lamb the steak is average im glad he did lamb is definetly what you should order if you are a meat eater
portions were very large, service was good
but dont expect a quiet romantic dinner here as the tables surround the tequilla bar which can get very very loud
i had to lean in to hear my wife
went there with a few girlfriends to catch up last week
waited an hour and 25 minutes for our food! it was tasty when it eventually came
drinks are mighty fine and innovative, scene is relaxed but fun
would recommend it but leave plenty of time to get your food
watch out
they try to charge you for EVERYTHING
Ixta got a bad write up in the Times but the reviewer could not have been more wrong!!!! The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the decor and ambiance was perfect--intimate but not cramped or crowded feeling
I tasted several items on the menu and they were all great--my favorite: the scallops
I would recommend this to anyone and will certainly be back
Hats off to Ixta and their chef Linda!
The service was excellent and the food was very good
They resturant was very accomodating because my group grew from 6 to 10 to 14
Everyone in my group liked the food - seriously, I was very satisfied and I will certainly return
In Short Orange walls and a yellow ceiling are tropically accented by vine-entwined rafters up front and a bamboo-framed open grill at the back
A single, narrow row of mostly two-person tables faces the smoothie station, where the counter displays high-protein energy bars and is topped by a bed of wheatgrass
Wraps--with fillings like teriyaki chicken, sirloin steak or seared ahi tuna--dominate the menu; smoothies made with fat-free yogurt also abound
Great food! I can't comment on the service as is I've only been there for take out - but they have a great selection of healthy food and yummy salads - I'd come from Bensonhurst just to have their food and forget all the other places for take out - this one rocks!
Good food! Poor Service
Without going into detail, would never set foot in this place again
A good meal is not worth being insulted and yelled at
Thriving establishments maintain The customer is right policy
Not this place
Customer service is just as important as the food a restaurant serves
Maybe this place should keep that in mind if they don't want to lose the business of others
They've already lost mine
Two thumbs up for the ambience and athmosphere, excellent dishes from all over South America, Tasteful appetizers, Delicious Dulce de Leche IceCream, try the croquetas yummy, outdoor seating a big plus for summer
A bit noisy at street for the hospital a block away, but relaxing for drinks or appetizers (Ceviche, Croquetas, Empanas, Serrano Pizza, Calamar) and a BIG 10 for the main entrees (Argentinian Steak, Pata Chancho, Salmon)
I have been to this place many times and the quality and service has been consistently wonderful
The appetizers are amazing and you can make a meal of several of them
The entrees are equally tasteful and the desserts are decadent! Plus you have to try the Florida mojito
I love the ambience and will be coming back for more
Great atmosphere and a great value, plus an eclectic menu and wine list
I have been numerous occasions and have always found the food good and the service polite and very good
I have occasionally had to wait 15 minutes or so to be seated, even with a reservation, but it just gives us a chance to enjoy a drink in their Moroccan Corner
Plus nice outdoor seating in the summer
The place is addicting
Been there a few times, first time food was very good, service so so
second time THE WORST SERVICE I have ever had in a restaraunt
8:00 reservations - not seated till 9:30 with nobody being cordial enough to tell us how long it will be in the meantime
I had to track down the manager, who disappeared and then she just made excuses
Terrible way to treat paying customers who pay their salaries
I would have been embarrased to have worked their
They had better become more customer orientated otherwise this establishment will fall quickly out of sight
excellent pizza serving the community late night
huge pies !! Really courteous staff
I order regularly
The food is excellent, prices are reasonable and the amosphere is festive
Definitely a great place to go out with friends
The only drawback has been the wait service which at time has been really terrible
my family had a great time
Foof was exellent and the margaritas were the best
we definite be there again and again
Service was slow on the desert
Otherwise triple A
In Short This lunch spot differentiates itself from other sub chains with its toasted bread-based creations loaded with gourmet ingredients like avocado and black Angus beef
Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more
Non-sandwich options include turkey-ranch and honey-mustard chicken salads, chili, clam chowder and other soups
My wife loves it! This is a great place and a great location
The food at Quiznos is really good, much better than the other sub shops out there
The meat was high quality and I liked the toasted aspect
My friend and I went here were told that there was a party that was about to start but we were welcome to stay
Before our server took our drink order she told us that the prices on the menu were going to be higher that night because of the party
We wondered why because the party hadn't started yet and we weren't even a part of it
She never apologized, never changed her facial expression
Just told us that was the way it was
Then they hovered over us and brought our check over to say that they were closing soon
This was my first time
It seemed low-key, casual which is what appealed to me
But in the end, the service turned me off
In Short The Archive's earthen-toned walls, mod, minimalist furniture, exposed brick and industrial lighting set a comfortable mis-en-scene for relaxing with a specialty coffee and a home-baked pastry
Film and video art projections, from the extensive DVD rental collection, flicker on the centralized, wall-mounted screen as nearby customers surf the internet on wireless laptops or browse through the well-organized shelves stocked with everything from the Czech New Waver "Daisies" to "Lord of the Rings

I had been going to visit friends in the Bushwick area for three years and to my surprise recently I found this little oasis in the sea of warehouses
This place is amazing
movies, caffeine, magazines, sandwiches
It's another reason for those artists who are getting more square footage than any of us manhattanites to stay put
Morton's was good in general
Quality food, nice service
A little bit over priced, but if you're going with a group for a nice dinner, it's totally good
i had one of the worst dining experiences of my life
the waitstaff was horrible
the waiter was extremely rude, and the service was absolutely unacceptable
for those prices, the meat wasn't even cooked evenly
more importantly, the waiter was so rude that i felt uncomfortable
not gruff, that is fine, this guy just couldn't be bothered

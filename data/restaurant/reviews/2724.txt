My experience at the The Pearl Room was like no other place in Bay Ridge, you walk into a dimly lit atomsphere and a well dressed crowd
The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic
The mouthwatering,tastefull meals leaves such an impression you will want to com back for more
The staff is very accomandating, it's especially nice to see the chief/owner Anthony Rindali walking around to make sure you are pleased with everything
Just make sure to leave room for dessert the fried ice cream is insanely tasty!
The restaurant is beautiful with great decor and lighting
The owner Anthony makes you feel welcome and important in his establishment
The restaurant is great for dates, family's and large parties (privite room)
I frequent this restaurant more then three times a month and I have never been board with the menu do to new specials all the time
The food is outstanding!!!!!! You will not regret this choose
under new owner/chef Anthony Rinaldi,the Pearl Room is at its best ever
His menu and specials are delicious
Pastas,meat, seafood,desserts are all good and very fresh
His hands on approach and interaction with the customers is an added plus
He will personally come to you and ask if everything is ok
Overall,a fine dinig experience in a fine restaurant
Great date place and a great bar also
I recommend reservations especially for a Friday or Saturday nite although not required
The first thing that hits you upon entering is the beautiful warm lighting around the welcoming bar
I have spent many nights with my friends drinking the best cocktails in the neighborhood
And then the food! Stay and eat at the bar or in the bar area, or move to a table in one of three different and inviting areas in the restaurant - the food is king! The seafood is wonderful and fresh
The appetizers are some of the best around and the entrees have a contemporary italian influence
The chefs specials are always wonderful
The chef/owner is always walking around making sure everyone is having a good time
And we are!
Never a disappointment
All dishes are an incredible dining experience
Start off with an expertly mixed cocktail or glass of wine at the beautiful bar
The staff is friendly and attentive
Chef and owner, Anthony Rinaldi, has brought this Bay Ridge establishment to another level of fine dining
Where do I start and what do I say first when there are so many great things to mention
I loved the ambience
The fire place in the main dinning room is an attraction to every one, but don't forgett the open garden during permitable weather
With it's newly installed waterfalls it feels like your dinning by a lake
The service has never disapointed me every time I go there
The waiter know their craft and are willing to accomodate you the best way they can
They can sing too, especially if you are celebrating a birthday
Last I ate there was during restaurant week in Brooklyn and although they were extremely busy that did not effect the quality of thier food or service; excellent, excellent, excellent
We went there just for dinner, and the place was so good we didn't leave
We ended up hanging out at the bar after dinner
The food, service and atmosphere was great!
The service was attentive the atmosphere was wonderful
The hostesses were welcoming, and the food was amazing! The chef-owner Anthony Rinaldi shows his dedication by creating flavors that pampers the palate from start to finish
The Pan fried nut crusted lemon sole comes in a lemon grass kiwi sauce
It was fabulous! The busutto wrapped pork tenderloin with pine nut and sweat yellow raisin chutney, was delicious
Which I must add the pork was like butter that melted in your mouth
The bar space made me feel like its the new hot spot to be
There party room was just redone and is beautiful
The out door garden has waterfall that makes your dinning experience relaxing and delightful
We left diner feeling like weve just experienced an exhilarating, culinary spa treatment
This is a great place for a date, occasion, party or a great dinner out with friends and family
I recently revisited the Pearl Room this week
If anyone is concerned about knew ownership, no worries
Executive Chef Rinaldi continues to dazzle with the stunning creativity you expect in Midtown
Pure delight for the palate
The crowd was more early bird special then young and sophisticated gen-x
Hostess was rude, waiter was rude
Had to demand a dessert menu
Pasta was overcooked
Overall a bad experience
There are so many good restaurants in Bay Ridge - try Greenhouse Cafe for delicious food and warm service
Avoid The Pearl Room at all costs, unless you enjoy attitude, condescension and overpriced mediocre food
Celebrated my birthday with a large group and the service, food and atmosphere were outstanding
The seafood is freshm the servers are informative
I would recommend to anyone
For those who prefer land, they have a juicy filet mignon for you - cooked to perfection
Enjoy!
I went there with my girlfriend and both of us love the place
The service is superb and better than a lot of fine dine in manhattan
The filet mignon was excellent prepared
We will sure go again
One of the best meals I've ever had
4 star food in Brooklyn
perfectly prepared fish, friendly service, exceeded all expectations
All smoke and mirrors, no substance
They draw you in with a fancy looking decore which obviously cost a mint, ply you with overpriced wines (one bottle I knew was a 6$and they had the nerve to charge 40) This place sufferes from the same problem Areos does, it rests on its reputation
Why this place does the business it does is beyond me, what it definitely indicates is a lack in taste for truly good food
My salmon was BURNT, my salad stale and our waiter looked like something out of season 4 of the Sopranos
If you need to be seen for some reason go here, or Areos
If you want to eat well, try Sofias down the street
I was very disappointed
How can you ruin sald? The salad tasted like there was pureed olives on it
beats me how they accomplished that taste
I didn't eat it
Next course was pan seared salmon
It was bland
It was tiny
It came with carrots that were 99% raw
The 1% that wasnt raw was slightly heated
The dessert was brought to our table, 5 creme brulees, before we even ordered dessert! We felt rushed as the coffee pots were removed without asking if we wanted more
We were handed a bill with dessert
There were 5 of us and we were only there 1 1/2 hrs, if that
Never again
For starters, the seating arrangements make this place so special
Being able to sit in the garden area or the curved and hidden benches gives the Pearl Room a real unique feel
The waitstaff is fantastic - professional and on their toes
Our waiter served the crabcrakes directly onto our plates!! The food was fantastic - especially the mahi mahi with lobster/mango salsa
The portions were more than fair - worth every penny! Good wine list, too!
Our waiter Will was exceptional
The food was delicious! I recommend the Sesame Crusted Swordfish

Food is great and a good value, but ask to sit upstairs (main level)! The basement (aka party room) has a musty, basement-y odor and the orange couches we sat on were dirty! The music was pretty strange and a bit loud
We used to go to Cafe Torino all the time
They have the best fried calamari in town
They's steak and fish dinners are awesome, and their pasta is delicious
However, if you are not into loud techno music, you will be irritated with how much you will have to shout over it as it plays over the speakers
On our last two visits, we had no success getting the waiters to turn it down, even a bit
So, we've never been back
The loud techno seriously distracted from our dining experience
I just visited Caffe Torino
My experience was better than I expected
Everything was excellent; food, service, host and most of all
price
A very cozy atmosphere with a great choice of music palying
Perfect for an intimate date or a relaxing dinner without all the bull of the Manhattan scene
This place was stumbled upon and what a suprise it was
The staff is extremely attentive, the outside garden is a must
Food is excellent, pasta and bread are made on premesis along with the desserts
The 4 times that I have been there were always consistent
I would and have recommended this place to friends as the prices are extremely reasonable for a place of this caliber
some old drunk guy who claims he is an American born in France seems to be a regular at the bar, he sat down next to us, listened to our whole conversation then started aggressing us verbally, and the waiter took the longest time to intervene
we even feared to leave the place
our worst experience in a very long time
This bar was overall AWESOME! Great service, band, shots, friendly people all over the place
I went for July 4th weekend in a group of 7 girls and we had a great time
To bad we didn't spend more time there
we had reservations somewhere else
Forget the garden and get the corner window seat for a people watching view of Bleecker Street
Very friendly and accomodating service, especially after realizing I had left a bag in the taxi that dropped us off there
The staff was kind enough to offer phone and phonebook to call the TLC and even bought me a drink over my tough luck
Food was good, though nothing spectacular - good for a neighborhood bistro
Prices are moderate, perhaps higher than average in lieu of location
NOTE: BYOB for a $10 corkage fee per bottle and drink like a fish for significantly less
I have dined here occasionally for many years and recently went on a Saturday night for a late dinner
The service was delightful and specials menu was all we needed
Conveniently located and always a good meal
Prices reasonable and semi-circle booths are the best in winter although the garden is also a plus
I have not been there in a year and things have certainly changed
We had a birthday party there and everybody was rude, from the hostess who asked why would we expect the table to be ready just because we made a reservation to the waitress who when asked what choices of beer they had said you expect me to list them all, never mentioned they had specials
We waited twenty minutes for her to bring us dessert menus, and then after waiting another 30 mins we had to find her and ask her to bring the birthday cake we had pre-arranged
Also, the garden is not that special
Garden is my favorite in the city - I found the service to be warm and friendly
Brunches and dinner are a gauranteed good meal
A great place with an incredible garden
The food is excellent, wine list good and atmosphere awesome
Pennyfeathers was recomended by a celebrity friend of mine who is a regular
Their food was incredible and the staff was extremely friendly and fun
Eddie was our waiter and my group loved him! The 23ish year old night manager, was charming and not to mention great to look at! I have never tasted a better Prime Rib ever! so goood
The steaks where very well priced and all over 1/2 pound
My friends loved the BB Ribs, Chicken Pot Pie, and Grilled Salmon steak
Its has an extremely cozy, sexy, and comfortable atmosphere inside
The music is a mix of classic soul, jazz, and salsa
The negative reviews must not have been at the same Pennyfeathers that I was at
*this restauarant is defiently in my top 15 NYC restauarnts
For a place that has been in business for 38 years I can see why
My friend and I went to PF for brunch, an hour after we ordered the waiter came over to tell us our order was up next
10 minutes later he came over to explain that the cook was out of the ingrediants for eggs benedict----fine, we re-ordered omlets and waited 15 more minutes
We asked for more coffee, water and couldn't even get that from our server
Finally, he came back to tell us they were out of eggs!!!! Hungry and totally fed up we left with no brunch
When we walked out so did about 3 other tables that were as angry as us
One couple said they had found a huge egg shell in their meal
Don't go to this place, there are plenty of great restaurants in this area!!!
Last dined here 6-26-05
It is always fun to have a meal or even just drinks here
I have always found wait staff to be prompt and attentive, Bartender Michael especially
Food has always been well prepared
I just don't understand the negative barbs thrown around in these reviews about this restaurant
This is a pleasant, cozy cafe in the Village - not the Ritz, okay? Go see for yourself - and have fun !!
This was one of the worst dining experiences
I don't know how they are still open
After reading the negative feedback from other people I wouldn't argue with them at all
The food was below average, but the worst part was the service
RUDE, RUDE, RUDE
My burger was under-cooked (bleeding) and I politely asked him to take it back and just credit my bill
He said he wouldn't because he felt attacked
COO-COO! Don't waste you good time or money! Seriously!
An overall horrible experience!!! The place was empty on a Saturday night, hmmm
? My friends and I (a party of 5) were seated and we ordered drinks
When the manager found out that we were not going to eat as well, he pitched a fit and lectured us about how he's got to pay his bills so we better eat
He cursed us and we promptly left his restaurant
I've never been treated so poorly
Plus, it did smell awful in there!
When we entered, we were cold, tired and cranky after discovering our destination of choice was closed
After 10 minutes in the warm atmosphere and of excellent service, the evening was on the right track again
The food was good and our waiter was informed and personable without being overbearing or intrusive
By the time we were finished, we were ready to face the rest of the evening in the neighborhood clubs
I have gone here a few times before and the food is quite consistent
Last night we had the most excellent waitress and service I think I've ever had in any resturant
She was attentive and very personable
The ambience is cozy and there was no one smoking at all when we were there
The music was at a good level for conversation yet very smooth and mellow
I enjoyed my experience and got my money's worth
At first glance it was not looking good
The place was so loud it made you long for a jet engine to stick your head in to get some peace and quiet
The noise wasn't from the music, but from the (mostly NYU?) fratboys and jocks who cheered the Mets and found other excuses for the peculiar grunts, razzes and other sounds that pour out of them at twice full volume
There was more than enough testosterone here to supply a dozen fertility clinics
After the game, the crowd thinned out and we were able to get our own table
The beer selection was decent-- including Magic Hat and Newcaslte Brown
The service was extraordinary, with attractive waitresses putting up with all manner of abuse including our whistles, and yo! yo! yo! calls
The appetizers were average and way overpriced, though
Still, it might be a fun place to go when there are no students in town

We tried Diablo de Uco, Salentein, and Majol - all had a nice forward fruit taste and full bodied balance of tannins and acid
The Malbec is especially good from here, but the Cab and Merlot are quality too and very drinkable
I went today with some of my friend to Buenos Aires and we loved the food, the place and the price
The service was so good and the owner was so friendly and nice to us
You can have a great meal for a inexpensive price
I recomed the skirt steak with criolla salad and authentic argentinian Malbec wine
If you are a meat lover should go to Buenos Aires in the East Village
An amazing combination of a great food (not just the beef), great wines and affordable prices
How do they do it? These guys know how to grill meat
No need to spend $25 for a steak anymore; here you can get it for $14, and better quality
They have a large selection of Argentine wines all below $30
Try the colita de cuadril, you can't get it anywhere else in New York
And don't get me started with the panqueque con dulce de leche
I've been going to Argentina Restaurants for the past 3 years
I loved this restaurant
It is inexpensive and delicous
I've already been three times
the mashed potatoes and french fries are super fresh
The rib eye is excellent
Also I loved the Malbec on their menu
Just when you think these kinds of places can't exist in New York, one opens up
My boyfriend and I had diner there the other night and it was amazing
The atmosphere was delightful
The food was delicious
We had the skirt steak and it was like slicing butter
We really enjoyed it
We are definitely going back again and taking our family and friends with us
The desert was heavenly
We had the crapes stuffed with caramel and drizzled with powered sugar and cinnamon
He loved the fact they had the beer from Argentina, Quilmes, and what made it even better is that they were ice cold
The best part about the evening was the wait staff was on top of things
As soon as our drinks were low they were right their to bring us another one
I went last night with my friends and i really love this place
I've been looking for an authentic argentinian cuisine and I found it
The bife de chorizo, the empanadas, are really great, so tasty
And the prices are very good
And if you love good wine do not wait and enjoy this beautiful restaurant in the east village in NYC
great argetine dishes, congratulation at such great prices a taste of the best that the ecclectic argentine cuise is all about with its the  superb meat and a good selection of argentine wines
a very nice dining experience
thank god i dont have to go into queens anymore for argentinian meat
the milanesa is like being in paradise
my girlfriend had the shell steak and she told me she didnt need a knife it was so tender
the bread pudding is amazing!i believe this is the only authentic argentinian food in the city
i forgot to mention the wine which is much better than any french wine i ever tasted and a whole lot less inexpensive
i had the Don Valentin but you have a long list to choose from
and the service is excellent
This new restaurant really knows how to cater to meat lovers
A varied menu that includes everything from the basic meat cuts to fancy Argentinean steaks to fresh pasta
I would recommend starting a combination platter for two which includes an assortment of kidney/blood sausage/sweet bread
Then move on to the real meat
The side dishes are excellent, especially the Provencal French Fries
For desert do not miss the dulce de leche pancakes and follow it with an espresso
Ah! The finer things in life, good food at a price that will not burn a hole in your pocket
I can't wait for the summer and sit in their garden
Singas pizza is, in a word, delicious
The crust is hardy and crispy, the sauce is not too tangy, and array of toppings assure you'll never bore of this quintessential New York street food
The clean, cute, and comfortable dining room makes for a pleasant visit
Pair your individuals pies w/ wine and beer and you've got the makings of a perfect casual dinner
The 10inch personal pies are great
We picked our own toppings and everything was fresh
The place has a fun vibe and is great for groups or intimate dinners
It's definately worth the wait
I went to Singas last weekend to get some late night eats
I was so pleasantly surprised by this East Village newcomer, that I find myself eating there at least once a week! I always get a personal pie with jalapenos and peperoni
It's outsatanding!
This place is great, fresh baked mini pies, its the best pizza and the place is great
Very comfortable, clean, good music and cheap
They also serve beer
Good for groups
I have only had good experiences here
I think the food is delicious and it's cheap! The head waiter has always been very friendly and remembers me each time I go in
While I will say that the rice pudding leaves a lot to be desired, everything else is fab!
For some reason this place is always empty eventhough their food is great and resonably priced
Especially the $6
95 lunch which comes with an appetizer, soup, rice entree
I recommend the chickpee sag
i love that place the staff is really cool the desserts are wicked awesome
I am hooked on this place
I have never had a bad meal here and the menu is great
The service/staff is very friendly and attentive
In the warmer weather you can eat outdoors which is a huge plus!!! I would check this place out
four friends and i came here on friday night
we had a 9pm reservation, though we probably didnt need it since the restaurant wasnt packed
the place is dimly-lit i had trouble reading the menus, even though the overall ambience is quite romantic
the staff were very nice
one of them came over to specially recommend a bottle of white wine ($25) to go with our meal
my bf i decided to split the brik ($8) since we had read good reviews about it
we werent disappointed by the layers of hot flakey phyllo dough that surrounded the saucy center of fish, chicken, and vegetables
it was a very good start to our meal
for entrees, we opted to split the olive chicken tajine ($16) and the couscous royal ($16)
the tajine was very flavourful, though verging on too salty
the meat was slowly simmered fell right off the bone
it came with a generous helping of slow-cooked carrots and green olives
the couscous came piled with lamb sausage vegetables
it also came with a side of what i thought was a broth-like tomato based-sauce with hunks of lamb stewed chicken
it was really good and really filling
though stuffed, we found room to split two of their desserts the rosewater crme brulee and some almond nougat frozen dessert
the first was very sweet, but it had a satisfying crispy sugar shell
the second dessert seemed to me like snickers semifreddo but without the chocolate swirls of caramel in nougat flavoured ice cream
both desserts were really good

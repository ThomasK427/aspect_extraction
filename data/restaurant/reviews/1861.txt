I love that I can sit down with a friend for hours or grab it on the go and feel really healthy afterwards
Its my little gift to myself
Emerald Planet sounds good in theory, but in practice I've always found it disappointing
The staff's always been obliging and quick to prepare orders, but the food's been disappointing
Even when it's well-prepared, the flavors often don't blend well
I don't have anything as negative to report as previous users -- but then, I mostly just get coffee there now, if anything
The Scene Chili-pepper lights and bright-colored hot sauce bottles line the walls in standard urban-roadhouse decor, but the East Village crowd, relaxing in ample booths and tables, makes this restaurant look more like a coffee shop
Beer is the choice beverage in the bar area, but the three-rum hurricanes, tasting more of citrus fruit than sugary syrup, provide a fresh take on the tall New Orleans cocktail
The Food Nothing makes for better bar snacks than this down-home Southern menu
Whet your appetite with the whole-kernel corn bread, then wash down some hush puppies with a pint of Turbo Dog, a malty microbrew imported from Louisiana
The crispy catfish fingers appetizer makes a big meal in itself
Calorific sides dishes like mac and cheese and black-eyed peas come in good-sized portions
Cajun-style entrees, from po' boys to jambalaya, are geared toward extra-large appetites
The location is great! Up the block from Bleeker Street train station
I liked the atmosphere
Its a laidback crowd
The menu had a variety of things which is great and almost pleasing to the eye
Its a little pricey for an order of Shrimp Po-Boy with a side of hand-cut fries
One of my shrimps had a strong smell of fish scent
I know its shrimp but it shouldnt smell that way
I didnt eat that particular one so I put it aside and ate the rest (the other ones were ok)
For a sandwich it had 6 breaded shrimps total
I figured for that price I should have had at least 8 or so
The side dressing was yummy! My husband had the cheddar cheese bacon cheeseburger and he was content
This lively restaurant is great for groups, as almost everyone can find something they like on this menu of comfort food (as well as an accompanying hot sauce in whatever strength you wish)
The whole kernal corn bread is a yummy starter, the margaritas are pretty good, the mashed taters are great and the barbecue pulled chicken is wonderful
I have to say that I recently ordered shrimp creole here and loved everything about it BUT the shrimp (tasted a little fishy, not that fresh)
I think I've enjoyed the seafood dishes here before so I don't know if that was a one time disappointment or what but I'll probably stick with the meat and sides next time
Great proximity to Ace of Clubs (the venue formerly known as Acme Underground); our waiter put the rest of my drink in a paper cup so I could enjoy downstairs
The food is very good and the service is very relaxed
Its a great place to eat without feeling rushed
Lotsa vegetarian options too!
I sometimes long for their chicken fried steak and a beer, this place does the trick every time
The game is usually on the TV too, which is good
There is a bar in the back and lots of tables up front that can be for couples or quickly grouped together for a large group
I have been to Acme several times, and use it as a place to get some soul-style comfort food
We always get the Granny's Fried Okra as a starter
I definitely recommend the meatloaf, corn on the cob, Mac N' Cheese, and Mashed Potatoes with gravy
Sometimes the mashed potatoes are a bit on the garlicky side, but nothing that can't be washed down with a pint of Yuengling
The drinks are mixed on the strong side
The service is below average, for the price you pay
They hit it about 1 out of 4 times with good service
It is a loud, bustling place
You sit closely with your neighbors, but have some good conversations
The manager is always walking about checking on people and chatting with regulars
Overall, I recommend Acme if you are looking for some good soul food and want to waddle away feeling full
Shrimp/oyster po-boy- you have to put it together yourself? You're kidding
A proper po-boy shows up dressed and they have no idea what that means
The breading didn't stick to the seafood either, and the quantity for the price was skimpy
My friend's steak po-boy showed up horribly cooked
The steak was seared on the outside, raw on the inside, and totally inedible
Service left much to be desired
We had hot buffalo tenders for an appetizer, and the waitress didn't bother to come back to check on how we were doing on drinks
The tenders themselves were good
On the plus side, the mashed potatoes with gravy were excellent- real potatoes with lots of garlicky goodness
Everything's good
The 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 oyster po' boy rocks the party
The chicken fingers and mac and cheese are yummy
Have a beer and pour hot sauce all over the food and you'll be pretty happy
This place has the best meatloaf I've ever tasted, the mac and cheese was yummy without being too greasy and the collard greens were simply divine with a kick
The Jambalaya was sooooo moist, with big chunks of chicken sausage
One of the best meals i've had in the longest time
The closest cajun meal in NY to Mother's in NO
After waiting one hour for the lunch to arrive, it was subpar and not even close to a good Cajun meal
The service was indifferent (and that is being polite)
No reason to ever go back!
The 1/2 shrimp, 1/2 oyster po boy is great (have it with the mac and cheese)
The mashed potatoes with white gravy are excellent too
great crab cakes - some of the best in the city! it's noisy and often crowded but that's part of the vibe
a good place to wind down and eat some tasty southern grub
I like Acme
I've been going for years, and maybe it's not the best food, but you know what you're getting
It's funky, friendly, and fast
You can meet old friends, make new friends, and pick up friend friends! The city needs places like this- watering holes of warmth and energy! And, frankly, I think they make some mean downhome Cajun cooking!
Order the Mac n Cheese side! The corn bread is also great, but lucky you, it's free!  The fried oysters in the poor boy or entree are good, as are the various ways to order catfish, including the catfish salad
This is definitely a fun group place, good for cheap eats in large quantities that are definitely enhanced by the beer
This place managed to borrow from 2 Seinfeld episodes: the Chinese restaurant and the Car Rental (make reservation vs hold one)
We arrived at 10PM for a 10PM New Year's Eve reservation and were told that we would be seated in 10 minutes
At 10:15 PM it was still 10 minutes; at 10:25, the couple at our table was paying; at 10:45 they were still paying; at 10:50 we left
Not only did they screw up the reservation, they lied to us about it
DISGRACEFUL!
The food was all pretty good, tasty and well-prepared
However, the service I received when I went there (alone) was awful
My waiter almost completely ignored me, but was bending over backwards to help tables on either side of me with larger parties
Plus, they failed to bring bread
When the staff did bring bread later, they served all the tables around me, but skipped me - no bread
This is pretty bad, but even worse at an Italian Restaurant
I had to order dessert and coffee, as well as request the check from the bus-person, as the waiter apparently was more interested in providing service to larger tables which would naturally reap a larger tip
Don't go there unless you tell your waiter in advance that you will leave a good tip
I will never go back, and will advise my friends to never go there either
Savore is such a treasure! The decorations are delicate, but very down to earth
The service staff is first rate, very gentleman-ly
And the food--excellent presentation and taste
Try their tiaramitsu, I guarantee you will never have better
I have never had a bad meal or bad service here, but for some reason this place is never crowded
We had our wedding reception at Savore and it was a great place
Everyone raved about the quality of food
We danced in the front area with a DJ stationed outside the side window piping the music inside
A truly great place with great service
The price was fair considering we checked the prices of other restaurants in the area

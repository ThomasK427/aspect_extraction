The people vary from law students, to doctors to bikers and internet folk, I've always had a great time there
A few of my friends and I were in Lower Manhattan hanging out and we happened upon this place
At first we were just going to grab a fast bite to eat then leave for other destinations
The food was great
An hour stop turned into a full nights hang
We met the owner doug, he made us feel right at home
The bar is cool with an old tavern feel
The crowd was friendly, we had great conversations and drinks were reasonable
So I wanted to give a shout out to the people at Woody's and say Ill be back soon
I've stopped by this place a couple of times after work
The early evening crowd is chill, young and professional
I've tried several things on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet
Great big wings, but I'd suggest ordering them extra crispy
The staff is always friendly and greets you with a smile
Plenty of tables to allow for some alone time with a friend in an otherwise sometimes crowded bar area
Try the Root Beer Float martini -- not your usual martini menu! Cheap beer and food in a small pub atmosphere
Check it out!
It isnt easy to find a place like this anymore in Manhattan amidst all the Lounges, Clubs and overpriced fusion fare, so I will keep it simple, just like Woody's; Great inexpensive food, amazing Burgers (unreal Veggie Burgers too!), great Specialty Martini's for only $10 (!!!), and a very nice crowd of mostly mid 20's to late 40's, hanging out having a good time, and no attitude from the female bartenders
What else could you ask for?
If another wine bar with tapas opens in my gentrified city i'm moving
Woody McHales brings all the elements of a bar grill back to the neighborhood
Best burger in NY, Cheesesteaks like the old town(I think the owner is from Philly), reasonable beer prices with the perfect complement of drinks for the women
the vibe makes it cool for a date, an after work or end of night last call
What more could you want? Chocolate covered deep fried twinkies! Dude, deep fried twinkies!!! It's places like Woody McHales that make me want to be known as the regular
and I gave them one, burgers are actually 8 bucks if you want cheese and it wasn't so filling, it tasted like any average diner burger
My friend had a cheesesteak, it was mostly bread, she also also ordered a Vodka Cranberry, and did not taste the vodka at all
We went again and sat at the bar this time, I had 5 pints of guinness and not one buy-back, I ordered a basket of onion rings and there were about 5 in the basket, the rest was filled with crumbs, the chili was not even edible
A man went to use the bathroom and the owner started banging on the door because he was in there for 5 minutes
then the owner just sat around staring at everyone (all 6 people in there) made us uncomfortable
Will never go back
I have been here several times now with my friends and I can say they have some of the best comfort food in the city
The Burgers are great and the Philly Cheese Steak is to die for
You wont lose any weight eating here, but it is worth it
Great Jukebox and very cool low key vibe
Very friendly, polite and and attractive staff who have treated me right every time I have been there
I will definately be back!
For $6
95 had a
5 pound burger with hand cut ripple cut fries
The burger was perfectly cooked -- on a griddle but not in the least greasy and nicely charred
The fries were thin -- potato chip -- style
I'm not fond of this style where there's none of the contrast between soft inside and crispy in and which never replicates the bagged crispiness of bought ones
And they were over salted
My friends had a nice green salad instead; probably a better choice
The place was empty at 6pm Sunday, the seating comfortable, and the ambience basic (lots of red light bulbs
hmmm)
The menu's fairly limited: stuffed skirt steak, burgers, sandwiches and bar food
Best cheese steak I've ever had in NYC
I've had several of them now and they have been constantly good
(I'm eating one as I write this
) Always a generous portion on bakery fresh bread
Nicccce
Waffle fries are outstanding too
Go, but don't tell your friends
what more do you need? The bartenders are hot and friendly, the food is super, I recommend the philly cheese steak, the best I had in NY for sure, you can even get it at around 1 AM! 3 large flat screen TV's! Great jukebox, the only thing is the owner, he never looks happy, a welcoming smile would be nice, but I guess the bartenders make up for it!
We had the unfortunate opportunity to dine at Philippe this past week
I'll keep it simple because this place is not worth the effort to elaborate on
The staff was incredibly rude, the food was greasy not to mention way over priced
We should have went to Mr
Chow!
On a recent night out we decided to dine with a long time friend at Philippe
We have been dining on Philippe Chows food for years at Mr
Chow and always had a wonderful experience
When we arrived we were whisked off to our table
A comfortable banquet situated nicely in the room
We started with a few appetizers followed by Pink Shrimp and Peking Duck
All was good, even though the service was less then adequate
We finished off our meal with some desert and a $700
check before heading up 5th Ave to walk home
Thats when it all started not one but all three dinner guests of Philippe were in agony
Yes, food p----ing! I was ill for three days having to cancel a trip overseas
When the management was notified they simply stated NO ONE gets food p----ing from Philippes
What a crock! I urge you either continuing going to Mr
Chow or if you feel adventurous Buddakan is delightful!
A little hideway with family-style flair, the food crackles with flavor in big, comfortable portions
The shrimp sate is too gorge on while the crunchy soft-shell Maryland crab arrives festooned with spring onion, salt and pepper that combines in your mouth for a taste explosion
The fried rice is warm and comforting, the 9 season spice shrimp is rich and tempting while the red king crabs are luscious and juicy
Philippe deserves a second visit - on the very same night!
I don't know who's writing these negative reviews
The place is an obvious winner
The atmosphere is is serene and sleek and tastefully decorated
The food is absolutely delicious
The lichido cocktails were perfect
The jade dumplings and singapore handmade noodles were so good we ordered seconds to take home
And the crunchy duck salad was totally unique
Don't listen to the naysayers
The place rocks
I have dined at Philippe twice and both times the service was consistently bad
The wait staff is disorganized, and there doesn't appear to be any communication amongst the waiters and busboys
We had multiple waiters approach our table to take our order even though we had already placed our order
Appetizers were brought to the table before the drinks were served
The main entrees were brought to the table before we could finish the appetizers
Fresh plates and silverware were not immediately provided for the main course
The first time I dined there, the waiter 'forgot' completely to bring my main dish
Philippe should re-train their wait staff to communicate with one another and better orchestrate the timing of food service
There should be a limited number of wait staff assigned/dedicated to each table
Many waiters does not necessarily equal better service!
I had dinner at Philippe the first week it opened with a group of friends and I was blown away
if you like Mr
Chow, you will LOVE Phillipe

Did I mention the food is organic? Try their brown rice! Yum
I plan on returning often!
when you arrive at tigerland don't be put off by the looks outside, because what awaits yoou inside is a dinner's delight
First, the service is terrific
speedy service with grace and a personal touch
next, before you start ordering from th wonderful selection of organic fusion food, look around at how the colors on the walls blend-all earthtones
they make you want stay and hang out awhile
Of course, the restroom alone is so peaceful in its decor, you won't want to leave
it's like going to a spa
as for the food, well, couldn't be more diverse, interesting, and tasty
the staff will help you select from an English language menu, and the pries ae NY prices
I can't say enough about the angel wings, a plethora of tastes and textures is found inside
I couldn't help but think of feeling like I was opening a treasure chest of tastes
Then there were the superb entrees, all servedin just the right amount of time
the chicken and beans were scrumptious
the duck in curry saue was hot, for those who love hot food, and was a different take on duck for me
The side dishes were all fresh, presented in a lovely manner and tasty
For dessert, I would recommend he mangoand coconut sticky rice
just enough to get the taste of a sweet with the tanginess of the fresh, perfect mango
Haven't had as fresh and tasty a mango in a restaurant in a long time
go with a date, a group, for a family function
I went with some friends and the place is pretty cool, very modern and hip
The food is pretty loyal to the flavors of Thai and Vietnamese cuisines with a modern touch
A nice add-on was the organic makeup of the dishes
My friend and I had dinner at Tigerland the other night, and we were really impressed
We eat Asian a lot (I cook it as well), so we really know what we're talking about
This was the most inventive, unusual, and delicious Asian I've ever had
The food was very atypical of what you usually find at an Asian restaurant; it really stands out
The rice paper rolls were the best I've ever had, and the duck red curry was the best curry I have ever had as well
We also had the Berkshire pork ribs and the angel wings; these, too, were good
Overall, it's a terrific restaurant, and I will definitely be back
The mostly organic ingredients with the spices and herbs makes each dish truly delectable! From the spring rolls to the Banxiao crepes or Angel Wings for appetizers, the berkshire ribs to the special fish of the day (!); there is something for everyone
Some dishes are very spicy (papaya salad) and one should be forwarned
Service is prompt and ultra friendly at this casual eatery
If I were to ask for improvement, it would be that the menu be expanded so that I can enjoy more of the scrumptious food! (and maybe to control the ac
) All in all, a truly delectable experience and friendly atmosphere will bring me back to this restaurant again and again
The food is still amzing! Jimmy, the chef, catered my wedding a few years back and I've been waiting for his restaurant for quite some time
Now I can enjoy his great cooking whenever I please
I've had a couple ofparties there already and some of my most critical friends loved it
A must try!!!
Prepare to be transported out of NYC for as long as you choose to linger at this sweet, innovative downtown spot
You will be swept away by the warmth an congeniality of the staff
They are all eager to please and the chef is willing to accomodate dietary restrictions
The rice beer is a must for drinkers, and be sure to try desert with coffee
Each course is an experience
Whatever you do
visit the loo!
After reading some press about this restaurant, my friends and I decided to go try it out one Saturday night
I should have known something was up when our drinks came (completely watered down)
The appetizers and main entrees were overpriced and just did not taste good (seasonings were too overpowering)
Totally overrated and a major disappointment!
Fabulous Food  Natural Wines  Friendly Service  Good Decor What's not to like?
tigerland is the best new addition to the neighborhood - creative, organic asian fusion really friendly staff
i went with a big group the staff kept the place open and the wine flowing
don't skip the desserts!
We went to the restaurant with 8 girls for a bachlorette's party
We had the set-menu for large groups and couldn't finish all of the food
Everyone thought the food was amazing, some of the standouts were the beef short-ribs, the duck curry and we all loved the Vietnamese coffee custard dessert
Loved the fact that everything was organic
Definitely a place to go back to
I went to Tigerland for the first time last Friday
The staff was great
It was near closing time, but they let us stay for drinks, appetizers and dessert
We had the rice paper rolls, which are delicious, and two amazing desserts
One was some kind of coconut/tapioca pudding
We had a huge bowl of it and practically licked the bowl clean
The other was almost like a Thai iced coffee creme brulee
Very rich and delicious
I found the wine list to be pretty reasonable and the waiter recommended a nice chardonnay
overall, a great find
Not sure what restaurant mediocre at best is reviewing, but it clearly is not Tigerland
Either that or he has a partcular axe to grind
There is a great reason all of the reviews here are so positive
it is OUTSTANDING
The decor is trendy without being obnoxious, and very comfortable for dining with a date or in a large group
The staff is attentive and friendly
Most importantly, the food is phenomenal, from presentation to taste
Try: Angel Wings -- Unique and spectacular
i still have not seen anything else like them in nyc
Ribs melt in your mouth
Paper rolls are a great blend of flavor
Cap your meal off with a Vietnamese coffee
Highly suggest getting a number of dishes to share
Highly recommend
I enjoyed my recent meal here, but a couple things were disappointing
The friendly, attentive staff readily answered questions about the menu
The angel wing appetizers (chicken stuffed w/crab and shrimp) really are delicious, as is the custard dessert, and the coconut-mango tea is fragant and lovely
The vegetarian spring rolls are surprisingly good, with a distinct, robust flavor and spicier than expected
But vegetarians have few menu options, and my yam and eggplant entree was sadly mediocre - the yams undercooked, the curry thin and mild
My boyfriend's tilapia entree was better, but not outstanding
I'm also annoyed that they charge for sides of rice (though I don't feel mislead - it's marked on the menu), as entrees are relatively expensive
I think there are better places within a 15 min
walk, but still plan to go back to try some other dishes (and get those angel wings again)
All these positive reviews are really surprising: Tigerland's food is fine, with fresh ingredients, but it is seriously overpriced especially for Avenue A, where there's better food at better, cuter places nearby
And, shockingly, they charge for plain rice without telling you - cheap and dishonest
The decor is overdesigned and cheap-looking
Completely forgettable, except that I remember I paid too much for what I got in a mediocre setting
I was really looking forward to going here, We had stopped by just before they opened after reading a preveiw in TONY
The owners were so nice and the menu was very interesting! It exeeded my expectations!! The staff was so nice and helpfull
The food was incredible(angel wings, lemongrass wild prawns and braised spareribs) I am glad to see the news must be out because it started to fill by the time we were leaving at 8:30PM

It is absolutely my favorite
I am currently pregnant, and I have routinely been sending my husband out to buy it in quarts to bring home
The service is great and you can really taste the love they put into making their ice cream
I'm sure that my baby will also become a dedicated follower
I had the Green Tea and the Lychee flavor ice cream
Very good I might make a special trip to Chinatown for this ice Cream
The ice cream at this joint is to die for
This place definitely has the best ice cream I have ever tasted and no wonder they won the Citysearch award
My favs are the blueberry sorbet and the black sesame
I learned from my trip there that Chinese are credited for being the innovators of ice cream
no wonder this place is so damn good!
Nice selection of exotic as well as more more routine flavors
Staff extremely helpful and friendly, even when the place is mobbed with customers
Go early before they run out of the flavor you have your heart set on
The ice cream here is to die for
My favorite is the ube and the black sesame
My boyfriend and I always hit up this joint after dinner
The people there are so nice and they recognize us because we are regulars
They already know our order the moment we step through the door
I bought my boyfriend a really cute heart cake for our anniversary and he loved it!!! I even got to pick my own flavors
Definitely go here!! The best ice cream award to these guys are well deserved!
but i luvv the chinese ice cream factory!!! woo hoo!!
This is the best ice cream it's always made fresh
My fav flavors are even often sold out by the end of the day, I highly recommend the pistachio and almond cookie
This place never lets me down
I love Chinatown Ice Cream factory cus I love the Green tea, lychee, and mango flavors
And the price is good too! If you're walking around Chinatown, if you don't have a cup of bubble tea, then u should go for ice cream!
I love the ice cream at this place
I have to say I had no idea Pistachio could be this tasty!!! In all honesty, I have never tasted a better ice cream, ever! I love Pistachio and chocolate flavors, and would highly recommend it to anybody and everybody
i've been going to this place since a child
and it's better than ever
haven't had the almond cookie yet
will try next time
i love the black sesame and lychee
they'll pack pints to take home
a must!!
I really love how this shop is coming out with new flavors every week
My new favorite is the watermelon sorbet
I also like the Ube, Durian and Wasabi
The service is great and this spot is always a must when I'm in Chinatown
'nuf said! Delicious, and deserves the locals and tourists attention that it gets
I dream about the ice cream from this place
I have had the red bean, the lychee, and the black sesame and they are all amazing
I had read about this place in the NFT (Not for Tourist) Guide
I was not disappointed with this place
Their ice cream is really one of a kind
It's not just the fact that they have exotic flavors but because the consistency of their ice cream is so creamy and rich
Of course I am a die hard fan of their lychee and almond cookie ice creams
It's is worth the trek from my place uptown
This place is really the crown jewel of ice cream shops in my book
All I have to say is one word
I love there green tea ice cream!
With friendly service and an amazing selection of delicious ice cream, you cannot go wrong with Chinatown Ice Cream at all
In all honesty, I love ice cream, and I have tried from many different parlors from all over the city and the selection at CIF dominates all
Their flavors are as exotic as they come and they all taste amazing
My favorite flavor would be ALMOND COOKIE, but I do switch it up many times because you cannot go wrong with any of their flavors
Also, the ice cream is made at the store, so it is always fresh
I've been coming to Chinatown Ice Cream Factory for many years
I love coming here because the ice cream is absolutely DELICIOUS
Another plus is that I know that I am getting a quality prouct because it is a family run business and one member of the family is always there making sure that the quality of their ice cream and service is never less than perfect
Christina already knows my order the moment she sees me coming through the door
I thought that success family run businesses were extinct in NYC but these guys have proved me wrong
I do not hesitate to assert that Chinatown Ice Cream Factory has the best ice cream in NYC, and probably in the world
The portions are really large and you'll never find flavors like this anywhere
The workers are also extremely friendly,not to mention very good looking
The ice cream and the great service are excellent reasons to go to chinatown ice cream factory
Freaking Awesome
They just opened one up in Flushing, Queens
There's goes the diet
Yeh, this is as good as it gets
Asian inspired flavors such as Taro, Lychee, Ginger and Red Bean are scrumptous
For those a little less adventurous, the cookies and cream is the best I've ever tasted
I've just discover this place, and this place has so many great flavors! Some of my favorites are lychee, mango and the red bean
But you can't go wrong with any of them
The only bad thing I can think of is that you have to get there early, or they'll be sold out!
So yummy and creamy
they have great standard flavors many unique ones too !   I recommend one scoop with half ginger and half mango
sweet and tangy combo for $2
50
And yes they will do 'half' a scoop - they suggested it to me !!
All these flavors are so unique and so tasty
The flavors inlcude, but not limited, taro, red bean, lichee and almond cookie
There are also ice cream cakes for any occasion
It's just too good for words to describe
For the amount that you spend($2
30), the scoop portions are decent
This place has some amazing flavors of ice cream
You might be intimidated by some of the more exotic ones at first but what's good is that they allow you a small taste before you buy
You can also mix flavors which is one of my favorites
Experiment, have a good time and enjoy great tasting ice cream
In my opinion, all the flavors are good with lots of rich and mild flavors
The lychee ice cream and almond cookie are two that are my favorites
You might also want to try longan sorbet with vanilla ice cream, or green tea ice cream with lime sorbet
Another great thing is that unlike many other ice cream shops, they don't charge extra for the cone
So skip that boring Haagen Daz on the corner and head on over
Why should you go and look for this place in Chinatown? It's all about the Almond Cookie and Lychee flavored ice cream
This merits a visit for Ice Cream lovers when you are in Chinatown
With so much flavors to choose from and the creaminess of this delightful treat, it's always a pleasure
I've been sent to Chinatown on lunch time treks just so my recent converts at work can have their fill
The only draw back is that you can never take a pint home not unless you live close by or you are toting a portable cooler with you

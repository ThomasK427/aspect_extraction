Well, it was well worth it! Excellent sangria, friendly waitstaff, and the food - awesome
Much better than I expected
Simple no nonsense dishes - but the flavor and taste - wow! Couldn't believe it
Every single person at the table was happy with every dish
And the price - we couldn't believe how inexpensive it was for the large portions
I will definetly be going there again
So if you can't get into Esperanto, walk up C to Cafecito - you will not be disappointed
any matter, day or night, this restaurant has cuban food tasting just right
lean meats, hearty sandwiches and abundant portions give this establishment the edge over other spots in manhattan for cuban dishes
if you're looking for freash quality cuban cuisine, stop by
for a cold beer with some chums or dinner with the family, even the mid-day break, cafesito is hot
i understand they're adding in happy hours soon

i can't wait
oh flavor yourself
FLAN!
For the homesick or nostalgic who crave a true Cuban meal (meaning rather non-spicy dishes, heavy carbs, lots of meat and a touch of sweets) combined with hard to find cuban beers, sodas, and killer sandwhiches- it's just enough to pacify the soul, but not enough to transport you back to Cuba
Well priced at around $6 for sandwhich and $10 entrees
Large portions like your mother would make you with just enough fat to make it tasty but not too greasy
*Food:Just about anything on the menu, however the sandwhiches are most popular and recommended
*Drinks: Thick, fresh fruit shakes are delicious, and hard to find Cuban classics in beer and soda are worth the trip
*Ambience: Busy Diner- complete with wide variety of customers, clanking kitchen and friendly, talkative servers
What a great experience
I've been there six times
This place is a real dining treat, from the exceptional real Cuban entrees to the personable staff
The red sangria compliments the mouthwatering selection of crispy beef (vaca frita)
You can't go wrong stopping by for a cafe con leche and a chicken empanada
The best addition to my neighborhood by far
Delicious Cuban food, really great value and surprisingly clean
The guys running the place did a fantastic job on the interior, the food is addictive - better than anything you'll get at a chain (the fried plantains are awesome) and the price can't be beat!
YOU HAVE TO TRY THE RESTAURANT TO SEE HOW WONDERFUL THE FOOD IS
QUALITY INGREDIENCE DONE IN SUCH A SIMPLE BUT TASTY WAY
GOOD PORTION SIZE AND PRICE IS RIGHT FOR WHAT YOU GET
GREAT SERVICE AND HOSPITALITY
PERFECT MOTHER'S DAY OR BIRTHDAY PLACE OR JUST ROMANTIC DINNER OR GROUP OF FRIENDS GET TOGETHER
This restaurant is a real gem -- amazing food, beautiful decor, wonderful ambiance
I recommend it highly for client dinners as well as your basic night out
The prices are reasonable, especially for the quality of the experience
This place should definitely be on your list
So, how do I write a review of a restaurant that is so good that you believe it? I'm not sure, just trust me; this is one of the best restaurants in the city
As an italian living in new york; i have tried many many italian restaurants
LENTINI IS BY FAR THE BEST!!!!  the food is amazing (cooked by the owner!!!) and the abience is wonderful
the mozzarella was incredibly fresh and the fish was perfect
even the homemade after-dinner drink was spectacular!!!  you have to try it
trust me

Great Food, Great wine, Great Service; nothing is missing
My wife and I have become regulars, we dine in twice a week and take out at least two more times
A Lentini night has become a part of our life
Worthed every penny you pay
I came here for lunch during work and left extremely satisfied
Stone street is gorgeous, the food was delicious and the service attentive
I will most definitly be coming back
(P
S
Their Jameson Whiskey cocktail is like nothing else I've had in Manhattan
)
This place was recommended to me by a friend and I was definitly not disappointed
The outdoor seating was lovely; located on the historic stone street the view is charming and very European (you almost forget you're in New York City
) The service is great, friendly and attentive without being annoying
I was not very familiar with Swedish food and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was
The meatballs were particularly delicious with great presentation
The atmosphere is delightful and I would definitly recommend this place
Finaly, interesting+healthy menu!! Great food, I don't remember having a salmon that good, and the shrimp soup they make out of their cold water shrimp is much more better than any lobster bisque
Service was exellent and the decor gives the homey feeling
The Stone street itself should definetely be on the map of anyone visiting New York
Highly recommended!!
I came here for dinner
The decor is very interesting
The service is friendly but a bit brash
The herring sampler entree is quite tasty- at least as good as the one at Aquavit
However, the seabass in a clay pot is barely edible
Overall, it is certainly not worth the steep price
I tried Salmon Egg Benedict for brunch which is really good! The restaurant offers a variety of tea
I love their little cute tea pots
The boss is very friendly
He changed fresh flower for every table which I think is very sweet
Serive is really good
This is a hidden gem, but you would feel like you are in Europe
You can sit out on cobble stone street, surrounded by history buildings, great reasonable price food
It is my favorite place
Great spot for eclectic scandinavian cuisine which is quite rare for NY (or anywhere in the U
S
) Delicate food and prompt service
The staff was very well informed about the menu and took the time to explain any questions and was very polite and attentive
The food was even better
We had a very nice dinner last week
The service was prompt even though the restaurant was crowded at the time
The outdoor cobble stone setting was beautiful, and the food was fabulous
Maybe a basket of bread before dinner was served would be nice
We loved the Swedish Meatballs - definitely the best we've had
Growing up near the Baltic Sea I learned to love the region's flavors and culinary traditions
Being a long-time New Yorker I'm also used to a variety of fusion cuisine offerings
In my humble opinion, the fusion of Scandinavian and North American (and even North African) tastes at Smorgas Chef is uninspired and unnecessary
I don't understand Swedish meatballs with maple syrup nor do I feel comfortable with tagine entrees in a Scandinavian restaurant
I also found the service surly and abrupt
I have 2 favorite Swedish restaurants in the City and I was hoping for a third
Unfortunately, Smorgas Chef is not it
The food is pretty good
Especially recommend the waffles with cloudberry preserves

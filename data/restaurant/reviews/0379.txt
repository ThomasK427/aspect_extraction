what a great experience
starting with the appetizers to dessert
s/l ravioli, diver scallops (only 2 in dish should be 4), cavatelli all great
monkfish, whitefish, lamb shank(delectable just falls of the bone)
Surprise the MUSHROOM RISOTTO as a side, what amazing flavor
The wine Roagna Barbaresca fantastic
Dessert the napoleon, the chocolate mousse, the banana tart, I would not have changed a thing
Ask for the table by the door
The short waiter with the glasses (sorry,I forgot his name) was one of the best I have ever experienced
YOU MUST GET TO THE HARRISON
We went to the Harrison on the at the recommendation of the bell hop at the Marriott Financial Center
I thought the atmosphere was great for many occasions
The service we got from our waiter and staff was great
His wine recommendations were right on point
The wine list was very nice
The food was excellent
Walking around we found this place
From the service to dessert everything was Great
Menu had offerings from fish, chicken, lamb, steak and liver
Everyone was delighted with their choices
Try the wild muschroom polenta ,you can't go wrong
Desserts are a must
This is a hidden treasure just alittle over a year old
Very friendly bar too
You can't go wrong here highly recomended
I went with my family for a special occasion and every course was absolutely delicious and so fresh! Everyone ordered different things of the menu from chicken to seafood and it was all cooked to excellence
Great atmosphere, great service and an overall amazing eating experience!
If you don't get the fried clams you may have missed the whole point
Excellent from start to finish
Looking forward to going back
Superb dining, stellar food, friendly service, great wine and cocktails all without the attitude or the price
This place is great! Even a jaded NYC restaurant addict like myself can be surprised once in a while
Try for yourself and I think I will find you at the bar there again


It's been a long time since I've been blown away at a restaurant
In the past I had owned several on the upper west side
I'm glad to be away from it
Way to much work and it's very hard to get all your ducks in order to produce what the Harrison has done, and done it right after Sept 11th and in Tribeca as well
The food is magnificent and the service was attentive and professional
I've been back several times with friends anad feel like I'm one of the investors
I'm Not
Wish I was
This is the most happening restaurant in the city right now and for good reason
Great restaurant
Great service, excellent food
Have the halibut
Worth a visit!
I had heard a lot about this place and was excited to finally try it
We could only get ane early 6:00 reservation for Sat
night despite requests to mkae it later, and when we arrived there was no one there
Not until about 9:00 did the tables around us begin to fill (so why couldn't they let us reserve something later??)
Menu was surprisingly limited with lots of fish and chicken and little else
I had the monkfish which was good, not great
On a positive note, our chocolate dessert was delightful and service very friendly
What a wonderful meal
I had high expectations before arriving and all of them were exceeded
The food was outstanding
My halibut was so amazing that I wanted to save the last bite to make it last longer
Our waitress provided excellent service and never let our glasses run dry
And the chocolate cake was the perfect ending to a very satisfying dinner experience
The only drawback, the crowd, which ranged from obnoxious to trashy
But don't let that stop you from this delight
With the Charleston-styled seats along one side and the bar behind it, you get a English pub-type of feel
Placement of tables is a bit awkward and close at times but the food (all but dessert) is great and very reasonably priced
The bar is fun, drawing a nice downtown crowd, and good for single eating senarios
Service can be a bit slow and distracted in the main room
I sure was suprised to see no vegetarian entrees on the menu-- not a problem one often has in NYC
The french fries were too salty
Diners are allowed to put their own ketchup on the fries, it would be nice if we could just be given a salt shaker and we could put salt on to suit our tastes
In Short Park Slope resident Aaron Bashy, former executive chef at Slate and Alva, stays close to home with this seafood restaurant
Aaron's wife, Vicki Bashy, oversees the desserts and manages the front-of-house
The 60-seat restaurant features exposed brick walls, hardwood floors and a small garden
Diners induge in classic seafood dishes done in a Mediterranean style, such as pickled mackerel, raw seafood platters, and fried clams
I was embarrassed to bring people here
The price would have been acceptable, however the food was awful
I've worked in the food service industry, and I would never have been able to put this food in front of a customer and expect them to eat it it
I am not a very critical customer, but I actually felt ripped off
We left a twenty percent tip, but apparently that was not enough to warrant friendly service
Do not eat here
It looks so good from the outside, the atmosphere is promising, but you are deserve better if you are willing to spend this kind of money
Frankly, you deserve better if you are willing to spend half as much
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant
The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant
If you love seafood, you would love this place!
Under the impression that the Minnow didn't take reservations, we were shunted over to the barminnow (one word) this evening
By the looks of it, everyone with a kid was
The limited and pricey menu was difficult to order from, and despite the manager's assertion it was more child friendly, we weren't allowed to order from the kids menu
The kitchens were one, so this was unnecessarily inconvenient
It took twenty minutes for our appetizers to arrive and an astounding 50 minutes after that for our main courses
My husband's burger was dense and overcooked, my daughter's order was wrong, and my $11 cocktail had a whopping four shrimp
The service was rude, the food spotty, and the portions miniscule
I wouldn't go back
It's really unpleasant to visit a restaurant where you're made to feel that your imposing on the kitchen and waitstaff
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious

we regularly visit this extremely fine restaurant
The service is always first class, the prices are great, as is the food
The menu is varied and always excellent quality and fresh - we are never disappoined with the experience of dining at Mon Petit Cafe
We find the staff are particularly charming - It is always a very pleasuable meal and I highly recommend it for breakfast, lunch or dinner - it is my most favourtite restaurant in New York City
Paris has nothing on this place
I have been to France many times and I always make a stop here if I can't be in Paris
But the more I have a meal here the less I need to go to Paris
I can't say enough about the food, all the way down to the salad dressing
The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is fantastic
You feel very welcome in a wonderful french way
If you want good food and a romantic evening out, don't miss this
Thank you Mon Petit
When you visit Mon Petit Cafe, you will step off Lexington Avenue and right into Paris! This quaint, authentically decorated French Cafe is warm and welcoming and the food and wine is PERFECTLY French! The small and intimate ambiance surrounds you with French music and French conversation and the service is pleasant, very attentive and never pretentious
Locals will want to make this their destination spot in the neighborhood and tourists will be very happy they stopped in
The menu is fantastic with something for everyone! I went for a late weekend brunch with my Mom and we wanted to sample everything! From traditional Eggs and deliciously inventive Crepes to the perfect Croque Monsieur or the delectible Chicken a la Dijonaise, your palate will be completely satisfied
The sauces are so tasty and be sure to have a glass of Pomerol! Stop in for Mussels and Live Jazz on Sundays and you and your friends will want to make it a weekly occasion
--Affordably priced and always delicious! Bon Appetite!
From all the french meals
my choice would definitely be difficult
with a preference for the Poulet la Dijonnaise
and the crabcakes (delicious) as specialty
Keep going there
and bringing some friends from France who fell in love ! Very good place in the city, better to reserve, especially for the great brunches!
As a french person, I have to say that it is ALWAYS a real pleasure to go there and feel home again
My wife and I eat here all the time simply because its the best and most authentic french restaurant in the city!Service is always with a smile and the food is always first class,and when it comes to value for money there is no place better than M P C!
Never been to Paris but I've been to Mon Petit Cafe
It is quite exquisite
The food is superb and simply delicious
Located on the upper east side it's the perfect restauraunt espescially after spending all your money at Bloomies
Be sure to try the steak and if not the duck
Au Revoir!
I have been dining here for about 10 years now
As with wine this place has aged beatifully
Located 2 blocks north from Bloomingdales this is a perfect place to enjoy a Kyr Royal after a long day of shopping
If you have worked up a big enough appetite I must suggest the Steak Appoive served with fries
Also the shrimo scampi is another one of my favorite dishes
The staff and service are phenominal
This is a perfect place for a romantic date, the ambiance is radiant
But be prepared to lick your plate clean
The food is to die for! Thank you Mon Petit! :)
For a Sunday brunch this little place two blocks from Bloomingdales on Lexington Avenue is a real find
The service was efficient and polite, the food was hot and great and the atmosphere very Parisian
A great little touch of Paris on Manhattan's upper East side
I wish I lived in the East 60's
This would be my kitchen and dining room
I have never had a bad meal here
The worst I had was fine, many very good on on occasion they were fantastic
There are no holes in this menu
I wish it were open Sunday nights
What a perfect way to end a weekend!
This is my favorite place to eat at in all of NY
Reminds me of some of my fav places in france
this service is great and more importantly food is unbelievable
pretty good wine list too
I recommend this place to everyone
This is a very small yet intimate French restaurant
The Les Crpe au Suprmes de Volailles Crpes filled with chicken in a Mornay sauce with side of mixed greens was very good
Although there was not enough salad dressing
My husband had the  Le Steak au Poivre Flamb shell steak in a brandy, peppercorn, light cream sauce which the sauce is EXCELLENT! I would not recommend this restaurant for large group of 10+ since it's very small and intimate
What's up with all of these pretentious French places that have overpriced dishes tasting like crap? Dropped $80 for dinner for two and the only half decent thing was a bowl of the frensh onion soup
Wine is overpriced as well, anything cheaper than $8 a glass is plain vinegar
My wife and I go to New York just to eat at Mon Petit Cafe
Cute little place
Reminds me of a real Paris bistro
Most dishes were very good, but not all
Appetisers were all very good
My steak was delicious
Shrimp scampi very tasty and a large portion
Calves liver was chewy
Our French waitress was very good -- attentive without being annoying
Really was sorry that the liver was a disappointment and accomodated by offering a different entree
Prices are fair for both food and wine
Tucked two blocks north of Bloomingdales is this Manhattan secret called Mon Petit
This lovely French restaurant delivers superb meals, excellent/ friendly service, and a wonderful atmosphere
It is great!!!
I've been 7 years in NYC and go out for lunch and dinner about 4 times a week
I always come back to this charming French Bistro in Lexington Avenue at the corner of 62nd Street
The food is excellent: Good French home cooking that never failed to excite me, served by friendly good looking young (French) people
Great location, lots of windows that allow you to watch the busy street life while you are enjoying a Boef Bourguignon or a Steak au Poivre with a glass of Cabernet
And the prices are right in this family business: Good value for your money
I feel very comfortable in this almost traditional (12 years) place in NYC
Not only is the food excellent, but the staff is wonderful
Friendly, and quick, this restaurant is the perfect place for any meal! If you are there for lunch, the Chicken Crepes are top choice!
I have never had a nice thing to say regarding a French restaurant until I dined at Mon Petit Cafe
The mood, set by gentle lighting, French music and subtle earth tone decorations, lends too easily to the hushed, conspiratorial whisperings of lovers
The steak frites is my personal dish of choice
I've had it twice now, and it is perfect each time
The steak is moist and tender, and the frites are golden and crispy
This is the dish that even the staunch haters of French food will love, just for the thrill of a perfect steak
Follow it up with an excellent espresso and a little dessert, the fresh berries in whipped cream if they're serving it that evening
I regret only that I never learned of this bistro when I was younger and dating
Mon Petit Cafe is definitely the perfect place for a memorable date
We wandered around for a while trying to find the perfect place
This place wasn't what we had in mind, but it did the job with good food and ambience
Great beer, too!
The Scene Jackson Hole is decked out in the familiar sort of '50s Americana that you'd see at a typical suburban Bennigan's, with dusty old Western movie posters and Coke signs on the walls
Grab a seat at the counter up front, or snake your way through the incredibly narrow hallways to the dark dining room or brighter garden in back
Service is friendly to the point of obsequiousness
The Food A plate of pickles lands on the table as soon as you sit down
Order a milk shake or root-beer float, leaf through the no-frills diner-style menu and consider one of Jackson Hole's more than two dozen burgers, all of which begin with seven ounces of good-quality beef or turkey

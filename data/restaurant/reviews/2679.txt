But wait isn't that when you would like it?
We had a wonderful evening in the Water's Edge
It was our wedding
The food was excellent, the service outrageous
Although it is a really fine restaurant, nobody was highbrowed and nobody had problems with our little children (3 and 5)
The view over Manhattan is phantastic
We enjoyed the ferry ride over the East river
I would recommend this restaurant to everybody
I had reservations about the place,because my experience has been that restaurants whose claim to fame is the view are frequently 2nd rate in terms of food, service etc
I was pleasantly surprised
We had requested a table near the window when we made the reservation, and we got a two seat table with a terrific view
We were greeted seated promptly
The decor is romantic
The captain and waiter ( John ) were friendly and attentive
The food was above average, my girlfriend had red snapper, I had filet mignon, we both enjoyed our meals thoroughly
My filet arrived a little rarer than I had ordered, and it was promptly reprepared as asked, with no problem at all
Dinner with a couple of drinks, dessert, and tips ( Captain Waiter ) came to a little over $200, but it was a special occasion, and well worth the cost!
Starting with a boat ride from their 34th Street dock over to Long Island City and a stunning view of east side Manhattan while you dine, it just doesn't get much better than this
The meal is a reasonable $55 for three courses and the service is extremely thorough and attentive
The meal is above average, too
The evening ends with a boat ride back to 34th Street and whatever you care to do after that
Cant do much better if you are looking for the perfect romatic dinner
When reserving, be mindful of the weather and expect to pay good money for the delicious cuisine doesnt come cheap
You wouldn't even know it was open if you didn't look carefully
Open M-S, breakfast and lunch only, this old skool silver metal train car serves classic breakfasts perfectly! Unlimited coffee refills, and family-run service
Unlike the rating before this one, I had a great time here
The waitstaff was very attentive and the food was great
It is a bit pricey for mexican and the location of this reataurant but it was still worth it
The margaritas were great, although again, very pricey($8!!!!)
Atmosphere is good, big tables and not too loud music in the background
I will be back
Tequila Sunrise II is overpriced
I usually pay about $9
95 for a chicken chimichanga with rice and beans, but at Tequila Sunrise it costs about $13
95
I don't mind paying $$$ for a good meal, but Tequila Sunrise has no right to charge what they do! For example, I ordered the mixed grilled seafood platter which costs about $29
00 - it comes with Lobster, scallops and shrimp - the lobster tail was microscopic and the food was tasteless
It bordered on bad
Not even the rice and beans was good
I ate it because I was hungry and felt cheated to pay $$$ for food that wasn't worth it
Even the steamed vegetables seemed like they were from a bag of frozen vegetables
In conclusion, the money spent eating at Tequila Sunrise II would be better spent at a restaurant that knows quality and is really worth the $$$
The Scene One of New York's most beloved Italian restaurants sits on a time-worn corner across from L
I
C
's Citibank monolith
Though the front room suggests a tattered social club, once Vicenzo Cerbone warmly whisks you into the comfortable, terracotta-tiled dining room, you'll feel right at home--in fact, part of the family
A devout clientele has reserved the same white-linen tables for over 20 years, and the brothers Cerbone (who manage the front of the house) know most by name
The Food Ida Cerbone's casalinga cuisine (or Italian-mama food) is timeless and sublime
Two loaves of crunchy Italian bread arrive warm, to be drizzled with superb olive oil, followed by the freshest, milkiest mozzarella
Pastas are handmade highlights: Pillowy marinara-kissed gnocchi is delightful, but delicate cannelloni, wrapped around seasoned veal, spinach and ricotta, is divine
Sharing entrees--such as striped bass moist with oven-roasted tomatoes, caperberries and olives, or pan-fried pork with sage--is encouraged
I went there last night and it was a disaster all around
from the terrible service to the waiting and waiting and waiting
we waited 1 hr for the appetizers which was a a cold antipasta and a calamari salad
the we waited 1 more hour for the entrees, which were never done b/c after an hour they come over and say they ran out??????????? r u kidding me
we got up and left
dont waste your time nor your money!!
The first time I came here it was EXCELLENT! Such great food and service
I brought relatives in from out of town here the weekend before Valentine's Day and the service was HORRIBLE! We were all very annoyed
I asked for water 3 times over a 30 minute period when I first arrived before I recieved any
After the wonderful anipasto tray came, it was 60 minutes before our plates were removed and dinner was brought
Even after this long of a wait the women at the table didn't get their meals for another 10 minutes! Very tacky
We did clean our plates and I do reccommend the Tiramisu
The homecooking here is from scratch, so it stands to reason that you sip your wine ,talk to your table mate,relax a bit and go about life a bit slower
When you order the pasta its cooked for just you not preboiled and reheated
I love the fact that if I'm in a hurry the staff ,when told , can direct me to dishes that will get me out pronto
Pasta takes 13 to 15 min
to cook at home
same here its home
just that its better at Ida's house than at yours
The wine in the cellar is not rushed why should you
Buffala Mozz
/fresh tomato, split a pasta(Shrimp Ida) Pig if its the special and a wine from the cellar is why we have been comming back for over two decades our threegenerations and the three Cerbone generations It is not like home it IS HOME to us
Ida s food touches my soul!! Ican really taste the love Ida has for the fresh ingredients, it comes right through to my core
Shrimp Ida is sooooo
simple, but the layers of flavor run so deep
The wine turtle just loves her pig,long slow cooking and wonderful spices makes each fork full(and I do mean FULL) dance in my mouth
please let Vincenzo or Anthony introduce you to the perfect pig wine(any roast really) Taurasi
they have many producers and years available on the mamouth wine list
Wine turtle has found value at all price levels and many rarehard to find producers are listed here
Insane levels of value are found in the big bucks wine 40to50% of prices in Manhatten
And the coffee is great too!!!!!!!!!!
Ida's food is wonderful- just ask the waitress what's good
Its family cooking, not hi end Italian cuisine, but everything is terrifically fresh
Wine list has many treasures + bargains
Mistake no
1, not listening to past reviews, second going on Valentine's Day
When we were seated an hour after our 8:30pm reservation, my boyfriend and I were so happy our ordeal was over
Unfortunately, it just begun
As we sat waiting for our menus, we started noticing the frowns on the faces of the people around us, watching as patrons tried to flag down waiters without luck, asking for things like water
The excitement/anticipation as entrees were carried into the room was high, only to be followed by sighs from hungry patrons
I literally whispered 'suckers' when our entrees finally came
We sat at 9:30pm and our entree didnt come until 11pm
Yes, the food was superb
But it was a LOUSY experience
Of course, I felt worse for the woman seated near me who was 8 months pregnant and waited even longer than us for her food
Service was awful and my party got ripped off! Their family-style serving method left us hungry for more
Instead of spreading two plates of an order evenly among our party, they finished them half way through and added a third plate to our check
not worth the price at all

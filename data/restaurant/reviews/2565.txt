To sum it up, the food was bad and the service was bad
The bread was hard and stale
The sauce tasted like it was something that came out of a can
And the chicken dish one friend was dry and tasteless
And when we were ready to pay our bill, it took us 10 minutes just to find him and another 10 minutes just to bring us our change
And it wasnt like the place was crowed
Our waiter acted like he didnt even care about us
Amarone is an excellent restaurant
However, the dishes remain the same, even with the daily specials
If you visit New York City, you must visit Amarone
The wines are tastefull and rare
Many restaurants may follow Amarone as their example
The best restaurant I've been to in New York
I would recommend it to all of New Yorkers
The pasta with truffle sauce is absolutely fantastic
The wine selection is quite decent and the service is very friendly
Very romantic!!
I HAVE EXPERIENCED AMARONE FEW TIMES, AND I THINK ITS GREAT!!! SERVICE IS ENJOYABLE AND FAST,THE OWNER IS WELL KNOWN TO BE A REAL GENTLEMAN TREATING HIS CUSTOMERS VERY WELL!! I AM SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE HAD EXPERIENCE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, BUT THEY SHOULD GIVE A TRY AGAIN, MAYBE CALLING THE OWNER BEFORE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR RESERVATION
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE GET REALLY BUSY,AND THAT SHOWS ITS A GOOD PLACE TO BE TO EAT!!!!
The seating was done immediately, this place is extremely tiny not intimate do not recommend taking children
The waiter kept us waiting forever, the pasta arrived raw not aldente RAW
The waiter was the least bit concerned
Upon leaving the restaurant we ran into the owner so we proceeded to explain our experience at his restaurant he was not the least bit concerned
I DO NOT recommend this restaurant and it certainly does not have good Italian food
Was very impressed with everything from the moment we got there until our meal was complete
The food overall was incredible! The Calamari appetizer was the best I ever had
The Chicken Amarone, Salmon Barolo, and Cornich Hen were also hits at the table
They sat us promptly and we were out in plenty of time before the show
This place is a great stop before a show AND even when you don't have one!!
Eaten here several times before and after the theater
Great Italian food, delicious salads, excellent pastas, good veal dishes as well
Save room for Italian cheese cake--the best! Very friendly and helpful staff and really do not need a reservation
Have dined here at least 5 times, each time I leave completely satisfied
I would call the ambiance upscale casual
The service is professional, the food is very fresh, and the prices are reasonable
Make a reservation if you plan to during the theater rush
Lookout! This pizza is sooo good
My boyfriend and I happen to live in the neighborhood and are lucky enough to order from this NY treasure weekly
It is simply the best
With his signature ciao!, Mr
Pizza Plus always puts a smile on your face
My husband and I ate at Pizza Plus several times on our vacation to NYC
Great pizza and also very affordable! I wish we could find pizza like this where we live
Been coming here for years for their ribs and chicken
Great place to stop by if your hungry or just craving a lot of food for not a lot of money
Recommend taking food out, not the best place to eat in for ribs
Their grilled chicken sandwich is very good
However after 2 tries with delivery we will never order from here again
They are rude
They lie about delivery time
They said that it would take 25 minutes, this last time, and it took over an hour
We called and they were terrible and rude
Walking by this place, it is a very small ugly looking place
not where I want my food cooked in
Doesn't matter much - they have great hamburgers - and wonderful fries
When it's warm, I love sitting outside eating nachos (half-price 5-7pm) watching traffic
Pasta dishes good but a bit pricey (add a small salad, Mr
Biggs)
Late night can be a bit spooky, but hey- I feel safe here
The wait-staff is friendly and hard working
Really go for the GREAT burgers - medium rare, yummy
Been a few times just to sit at the bar for a beer
The food's not too bad, plenty of TVs to watch whatever local game is on, and the kareoke on tuesday night was fun
not the best singers, which makes it that much better
Mr
Biggs has the best Karaoke in New York City, thanks to the FABULOUS karaoke DJ, Brandon
He's a fantastic singer and he really knows how to entertain and keep the party going
He also has a very fair system for letting everyone sing one song before anyone gets to sing again
On any Friday night you will find a number of professional, semi-professional and even Broadway singers belting it out there
I have often heard songs sung way better than the original
At the same time, the crowd is so warm and friendly that any non-pro (or slightly drunken reveler) can give it a try and still get a roomful of love and applause
Brandon fosters a fabulous environment and I've never had anything less than a incredible time
Fleet week is especially fun with drunken sailors in the mix
Go for the karaoke and you'll be hooked!!
Mr Biggs is great!! Great food, great atmosphere, great staff
The karaoke host there is awesome! She's a great host and gorgeous!! I think her name is KC
We had an amazing time there
Definately recommend!!
I spent my 40th birthday at Mr
Bigg's, and it was a fantastic way to celebrate
Karaoke, good food, great drinks, and wonderful atmosphere for my friends and I
They made my birthday a very memorable one
I reccomend it to anyone looking for a great place to party
awesome, fun every time I go there for karaoke
the staff is friendly and the service is good
the food is great
I have been there a couple of times and would recomend it to everyone
the karaoke host, I think his name is Brandon is fenomenal, really knows how to make a party atmosphere
I haven't been there apart from karaoke nights so I don't know what it's like at other times
but I have a feeling that it's good
I havent been there at night yet but I'm defnitiely going to check it out
I got the lunch special on a Monday which was $7
95 for a cheesburger, fries, side-salad, and a draft beer
The waitress was very friendly but not overly attenitive, the perfect combination
The fries were awesome (if that's what does it for you)
There's about 12 televisions w/sports on and a constant supply of good music
Definitely stop by
Good burger with friendly service
Which is rare, especially considering people earn a living from tips
Based on the high reviews of this restaurant, I booked a table for a special event in advance

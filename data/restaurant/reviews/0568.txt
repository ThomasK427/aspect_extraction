The food is divine: everything cooked and presented perfectly
And don't even think about leaving without having the fantastic, straight-from-the-oven chocolate souffle
Hidden a block away from the WTC site, this place has great food and service
Food is served quickly
Portions are just right
The chocolate fondant cake with vanilla cake is amazing! Perfecto balance with the great seafood
Would go more often if it were cheaper
I've been to the Roy's in Kona and it was amazing
Had the tiger shrimp and grey snapper
Paid about 120 bucs for 2 people including wine
Our waiter, Chris, was one of the most attentive/polite I have ever seen
The dishes were delectable
The combination of sauces was awesome
I love this place , just wish they would boost the decor
Restaurant Week has turned into a sometimes unpleasant experience with cranky waiters and lackluster food
However, Roy's is one gleaming exception
Went for restaurant week and surprisingly on the menu were entree options of Mahi, Mahi, Kobe Beef ribs, Salmon and some other things in very reasonable portions
Appetizers included delicacies such as crab cakes and some other goodies I can't remember
They had a nice selection of decently priced wine pairings to go with the restaurant week menu
I had the Mahi Mahi which was excellent, and crab cakes which were excellent as well
The chocolate souffle was to die for
Everything I ate make my mouth water
Best of all, our waitress was charming and knowledgable
The most worthwhile restaurant bill I have had in a long time, I give Roy's top scores
Went to Roy's for Restaurant week last friday
The food was absolutely amazing
I had the crab cakes for an appetizer, the honey mustard kobe beed (mm
so scrumptious) and flan for dessert
I was impressed with every dish and was tempted to go back for dinner that night! The service was great -- my glass was refilled without having to ask, we were greeted by the manager that day to ask how our food was
I took a peek at the regular lunch and dinner menu and the kobe beef appeared to only be on the lunch menu and the prices were a bit high
But I definitely recommend this restaurant for Restaurant week or for a nice night out with friends/date
I definitely want to go back and try a hawaiian cocktail!
called Thurs nite to make reservations for Friday but was told they were booked for the night
however they offered me counter seating/bar seats
figured it was better than nothing
on the actual night, they asked whether i would prefer a table
totally didn't expect that
service was excellent, our waitress was extremely amiable and checked on us frequently the whole nite
she told us that if we wanted the famous chocolate scouffle, she could put the order in b/c it would take about 20 mins to prepare
i was shocked that service was superb
roy's canoe (appetizer) is a must try
entree came immediately after we finished our appetizer
i've never been to a place where service was this great
food had a distinctive taste which i liked and presentation was fancy
definitely recommend this place and will go back again
I'm surprised to see a bad review about this restaurant
I've come here twice and both times I've had great service, yummy food, and good times
The minute I walk in, the waitstaff is extremely friendly and make me feel right at home
Although not all of the dishes are impressive, the crab bisque and macadamia crusted fish are worth trying
They're both wonderful
In fact the crab bisque alone is what keeps me coming back for more
I don't know who has been rating this restaurant, but its score should be more like 3 or 4
The food was the worst any of us have ever had and we've eaten some adventurous but gross stuff
Food was so poorly prepared, usually oversauced, that some entrees were actually inedible
One fish dish reeked of gasoline, the result of using a grill before the charcoal is ready
Then, they forgot our souffles despite our pre-ordering them at the start of meal, so we were told to wait an extra 20 min
When we told them to just cancel the souffles, they made a big deal out of not charging us, when in fact, souffles were already paid for as part of our prix fixe -- no substititute dessert was served! I'd never go back and recommend others not to waste their time, money or calories
A dismal dining failure
The Scene Inside the imposing corner space is a boisterous, clubby atmosphere of large, crowded dining rooms packed with moneyed men wearing ties and feeding noisily
The waitstaff hovers and joshes in white jackets, carts laden with meat travel to and fro and the downstairs bar seethes with activity
The surfaces are a bit scuffed with age, but the experience is highly polished
The Food The menu here includes sirloin, double sirloin, filet mignon, prime rib and a chateaubriand for two, as well as a host of other beef-eating opportunities
The steaks, particularly the sirloins, are of good quality
A smoky Cajun-spiced filet mignon makes a nice variation
Seafood choices abound, including a tasty tuna steak and lavish raw-bar options
Among sides, the creamed spinach is excellent and steamed vegetables, such as asparagus and string beans, are fresh and simple
Desserts taste like an afterthought
do not get the porterhouse or other steaks, the prime rib is the way to go - so fatty not tender or tasty at all
I was so dissapointed I just ate the sides (mash potatoes spinach)
the others feigned lack of appetite also did not make much of a dent in their steaks
they more or less had a liquid lunch
lucky my boss paid for client meal, I wouldn't even com back here on expense account
psst off at poor food, had to grab a pizza at next door deli!!
SW came highly recommended to me and I was excited to try
I was extremely disappinted in every aspect from the over priced menu to the lack of service
Waiter took our drink order and then we didn't see him for 15 minutes
Appetizer was good (Crab cake and Caeser salad)
Water was delivered since with the entree 45 minutes after we sat down
My steak was good but no where near the quality of Delfrisco's, Ruth Chris or Morton's
My wife (Filet undercooked and very fatty) and Father (Strip overcooked) had theirs cooked wrong
All items were pricy and only about average
We went to Smith and Wollensky as part of a Restaurant Week Promotion
As this restaurant is usually very pricey, we were excited to try the food we've heard so much about for reasonable prices
Unfortunately, we were VERY disappointed
The salad I received was Iceberg lettuce with nothing else in it (no tomatoes, carrots)
Our waiter paid absolutely no attention to us
the table was never cleared
Our appetizer was taken away when our entree arrived
Our food was average at best
My fiancee's steak came with no side dishes
He then ordered a second glass of wine and it never came! Overall, we were very disappointed with the service as well as the food
Restaurant Week is meant to entice customers to come back to restaurants
However, not only will I not go back, but I do not recommend this restaurant to others
First of all, a charred outside on a medium rare steak is how it is SUPPOSED to be done
If you are looking for grillmarks (which broiled steaks dont have) go to the outback
Great service by friendly waiters
The portions are all huge - good luck finishing this meal
I always opt for the more relaxed atmosphere of the Grill Room on the side of the building because the main dining room feels awfully stuffy
I took my sister for her birthday and we were both EXTREMELY disappointed
I ordered my steak rare and it came out burned

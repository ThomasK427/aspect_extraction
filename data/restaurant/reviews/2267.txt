A small, see-through wall is stuffed with stones, and a tree festooned with lights branches out from the front desk all the way across the ceiling
Service is impeccable, good-humored and informative
The Food Chef Nao Sugiyama serves in the traditional kaiseki style--a kind of tasting menu consisting of between six and 12 small courses
There is extremely fresh sashimi on the menu, but most of the dishes are more exotic
Sea urchin, quail egg and Japanese yam mixed together and served in a shot glass is surprisingly delicious
Densely-flavored, almost smoky soup is poured from a teapot full of vegetables--open the lid to pull them out, too
Fatty Kobe beef imported straight from Japan is as tender as it is expensive
I live in the area and have been there many times over the past year
I love this place! The food is great and the service is impeccable
I cant wait to go back!
I've been here several times, and I really think that they serve best traditional Japanese food in New York
You may enjoy the meals if you seat at the counter
This place is highly overrated
We went there as a party of 8 and since then, this restaurant became an inside joke, referring to the horrible experience we all had there
Each course in the prix-fixe menu was tiny and unappetising
Nothing is cooked (unless you get the $125 Kobe beef menu, in which case you get 4 tiny squares that you fry yourself)
Atmosphere is no better than any cheap dine-in pizza place
And don't expect a lot of class from the waiters
After dishing out about a thousand bucks (for all 8) we all left hungry
We had the $112, 8 course Modern Kaiseki but the only dish that we really enjoyed was the sashimi bowl, everything else was a disappointment
Not worth the money and definitely overrated
Because of the 9
8 rating we went with high expectations
When walked in was the impression of is this it? However, the place started growing from Maiko-san attention to the cute decoration, the open chef kichen to the great food
Was mainly impressed with the mushroom salad, incredible for a solid eater like me
Also, great Kubota-manju, $53 though
However, the Manju was enough for my fiancee and me
Excellent sachimi, great traditional Kaiseki (adds a great presentation touch)
Friendly cooks and service
Good dessert
This was my first time eating Kaiseki- I guess best described as a Japanese ceremonial type tasting menu
And I loved every bit of it
The food was unique, from sushi to uni shots to seafood grilled over a hot rock on my table
It was absolutely delicious and artistically arranged
The ambiance is beautiful and the waitstaff extremely knowledgeble on the menu
I reccomend the 6 course menu for two people- I didn't leave stuffed to the gills, but satisfied
The chef (as stated below) is incredibly fond of uni and used it in more than half our dishes
However, the price is high, but I felt that it was worth it for the experience and the quality
My husband and I lived in Japan for 3 years and love quality Japanese cuisine and decided to try Sugiyama for our anniversary
It was a lovely experience
For $68 each, you get an 8 course meal, which is very filling, plus dessert
You can cook seafood or beef on the hot stone, get a variety of small delicacies, service was excellent, knowledgeable and friendly
If you are looking for sashimi only, this is not the place, if you are looking for fusion japanese like Nobu, this is not the place
If you just enjoy good quality japanese food and alot of variety, in a nice traditional but not stuffy atmosphere, this is the place
fine japanease food not sushi restaurant  omakase is best meal
If you want a true kaiseki dining experience, this is the place to go in NYC
The restaurant features several different kaiseki dining options from under $50 to above $150
The standard 8 course modern kaiseki for $68 is the best value on the menu
Chef Sugiyama will take you on a diverse tasting course from raw to cooked, rich to refreshing with his perfectly balanced dishes
Each meal is paced to perfection with just the right amount of time between each course to both reflect on what was just enjoyed and what is coming up next
Service was the best I can recall experiencing in a long time
The restaurant is small and the ambience is almost family like
If there is a better kaiseki experience in NYC, I have not found it
This is an experience to be had
Everything was interesting
The Uni selection was very good but they couldn't tell us where they get their uni except they get it fresh (whether from Maine, California, Oregon, etc
)
But the total cost is an eye popper
Go here only if you can afford to but do not expect your normal sushi fare
But for my $$$ I have found another home in Raku - It's Japanese! on 47th
Their Uni is from Santa Barbara - sweet mild! And for much less $$$ we can get the Love Boat have the best sushi in town
I have never been moved to review an restaurant after eating there, but after my experience last night at Sugiyama, I have no choice
This was, by far, the most comprehensive dining experience I have ever had
The food, the presentation, the explanation and descriptions of the courses were are perfect
The meal was flawless
I cannot stress enough that you must try this place
and return often
I know I will
To give a maximum value rating for a $100+/ head restaurant gives a fairly good indication of the amazing quality and quantity of food that you get here
This is definitely not the place for the culinarily-cautious or for anyone who doesn't like Sea Urchin
But if you want to eat varied, delicious, fresh, original food with plenty of sea urchin, then I cannot think of anywhere better
The decor / atmosphere is pretty ordinary, but it is generally irrelevant as one becomes utterly consumed with the consumption of course after course
The staff - in particular in the booking process are very friendly too
A true NYC treasure of finest quality gourmet cuisine
In the japanese tradition of a kaiseki course meal, each serving is as a gift from this world class chef - combining fine, rare and seaonal ingredients - each presented on beautiful japanese dishes
This fine meal is complemented with an excellent selection of sake and finished off with surprizingly wonderful grapefruit jello
The refined, elegant setting with beautiful floral designs, will satisfy your most sybratic yearnings
Put simply, this is the most authentic, most delicious, most colorful Japanese restaurant I have ever been to
Easily outrivals opponent Nobu - the food is delicate, creative, an experience like any other
This has my highest recommendation
An amazing restaurant hands down!
My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I absolutely loved it
I've tried dozens of sushi places and this is by far, the best
Don't expect typical sushi dishes, for you will be disappointed
My boyfriend and I both got the chef's 8 course recommendation (he also got it with kobe beef) and it was an unbelievably filling amount (and trust me, my boyfriend can eat =P)
The chef creates tantalizing dishes and delicacies including monkfish, fatty tuna, and uni, and it all just melts in your mouth
The service was impeccable - they were always there to help you with anything, especially with explaining everything on your dish
Their friendly nature was always courteous and had definately made the meal more enjoyable but beware and make sure you bring out your paycheck
it can be expensive
It's definately an experience everyone should try on a special occasion
A++++++++
I went for the $150 kobe tasting menu
It was way too much food
Would recommend 4 course tasting, 5 max
With sake and tip it rang in at nearly $500 for two people
Worth it? Maybe once
This place is overrated and expensive
Sure the chef takes you on his adventure with his food and it was unique, but the portions were so little that I left the place still hungry
I personally didn't find the food that great either
good luck if u go here

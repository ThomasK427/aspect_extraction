Why? Because my guests were all French speakers
That was the policy explained by the manager
Try another restaurant!!
Rating on the 3rd av (btw 83/84)This is probably the best neighborhood sushi place around
It is very relaxed and the people here are always happy to see you
The fish is fresh and the daily specials are always very traditional
From the Sushi to the green tea you will not be dissapointed
I eat at the Kodama restaurant on 3rd ave between 83rd and 84th street
The food tastes great and they give you a lot of it for your money
The staff is also very helpful and kind
They even offer your warm towels to clean your hands with before you eat
Their lunch prices are especially good
The Scene The double townhouses that comprise this restaurant and adjoining cabaret are replete with antique furniture, decorative china and glass, Russian paintings, old theatrical costumes and 19th-century photographs
From the marble-topped bar to the gold-painted ceiling, there is hardly an unornamented inch in the place
The Food Extravagance happily extends to the food
Begin with blinis, the Russian national dish: Warm buckwheat pancakes are drizzled with melted butter, filled with generous helpings of sour cream and caviar
From here, move on to the zakuska appetizer platter, the Russian equivalent of tapas or dim sum
As far as entrees go, a giant tureen of borscht, heady with pork and dill, is an excellent example of how homey and delicious this soup can be
The service was exquisite, decor is beautiful! Ever since April and beyond the overall experience has changed into a more spectacular dining experience
The honey vokda is divine, the foie gras is to die for,and the russian tea is absolutely amazing! I had a wonderful time with my fiance, i would highly reccomend this restaurant to everyone in new york city!
Its a wonderful place for romantic dinner
We've been there a week ago and had very nice time
Food was good
Blinis, caviar, meat plate,Lamb,Kiev kotleta, cakes and honey vodka are something
Don't think that you can't wear dress or suit there
My boyfriend thought that he's underdressed
Went to this restaurant recently, glad to see others agreed with me and would not recommend Firebird
Service and management rude and incompetent
Food unappealing
Such a competitive market in New York, I don't know how this restaurant has survived
Does not represent Russia well--vodka, people, or food
I have been to fine dining in numerous cities, trust me
go somewhere else
We went for our anniversary
We had a truly wonderful time! The infused vodkas were wonderful
Our favorite was the Honey Vodka
We're making sure to stop back by just to have a glass of it when we go up for Christmas this year
Our dinner was fabulous and dessert was to die for
The atmosphere is wonderful and the service very professional
I was in last week for what I thought would be a good place for an anniversary dinner
Boy, was I ever wrong
Not only did we have to wait to be seated-we had a reservation-but we had to wait at least 15 minutes to have our order taken
When our food finally came out, after reminding our inept server, the plates looked fithly and my chicken was cold and undercooked
If it that weren't bad enough, the chocolate cream in my husbands cake was sour and my ice cream was freezer burnt
The manager didn't even offer to compensate this disaster of a meal
For the price we had tp pay you would think we would have enjoyed ourselves
I would DEFINITELY NOT RECCOMMEND FireBird to anyone!! There are better place in NEw York for less money and higer quality
Take your business elsewhere
I am still in shock at our terrible experience with firebird
We went there for mine and my husbands aniversary, and the service was terrible! But worst of all, they said they were apart of NYC restaurant week, but once we got there they said that the $35
00 pre fix was only from 5-7pm But no one mentioned this to us when we made our reservation, and specifically asked for the restaurant week special
Our tab was almost $200
00 dollars
And the food was mediocre at best
I would not reccomend Firebird to anyone
By the way, this is the first bad review that I have written about any restaurant
Are you kidding me with the caviar prices
Was told that the caviar came form petrossian and tsar nicolai in ca, i chacked their prices and felt that i was truly ripped off easily a 300% mark-up go straight to the source
firebird truly disappoints
It is one of the most elegant places I ever been in my life
Reading the other ratings, people should have a little sense of taste when food comes to the table
This is the First time that I had such a wonderful food (fusion of Russian and French) which is the food that the Czars in Russia used to dine when Catherine the Great was ruling Russia
Brigton Beach is more casual and I haven't read NOT EVEN ONE good review of one single restaurant there
Im Russian and I think that Firebird is the not only the Grand Dame of Restaurant Row, I think it is the Czarina of Russian Restaurants
Starting for the beautiful hosstes that check you in, the attentive staff including managers and captains and the wonderful service, food and ambiance, Im sure that Firebird will be your next unforgetable dining experience
Keep it up!
The Grand Dame on Restaurant Row! This experience couldn't have been any better, we were treated like royalties and felt at ease in such sublime ambiance, decorated as the traditional russians would
The traditional service is follow graciously by the staff and such professional demeanor was a big part of the satisfactory experience
We indulged with the impressive selection of the finest caviar, again, served impecably and traditionally
We decided to choose from their vast collection of Vodkas
WOW!
The plates started flowing in, the Sturgeon was one of the best, (I would order it again), The Chicken Kiev was as well memorable
The desserts were among some of the best we had
I do believe Russian cuisine may be a different experience for a lot of people, but if someone decides to have one, The FireBird is the place to have it! The pianist was great!
Having great Russian food experiences in the US and abroad, I was surprised by how mediocre and expensive the food was
The service was not terrible but a little stiff
Decor leans toward Vegas
This is a place strictly for tourists with money to burn
If you're a local in search of good blini try one of the places in Brighton Beach
That's where Russians eat
Wow! Good impresion as soon I walked in the restaurant
It's like a museum
Great for romantic dinner with your spouse
The vodkas, caviar, champagne and food were divine
Service was very attentive and cordial
Be ready to spend a couple of hundreds since they have unique vodkas and food (Chiken Kiev is to die for!) nothing less spected for a place like firebird, Classy and luxurious
what a good option for fine diners in manhattan
Spasiva!
Mediocre American entrees posing as Russian fare at ridiculous prices
$19 - vodkas, $8 cokes and $35 pork chops, interior is somewhat moth eaten and service inept (had to be reminded several times to deliver my order) and with attitude, when dissatisfaction was expressed the reply given was that is how its done, indeed, done very poorly
Avoid firebird, apart from the decor there is very little that is Russian about it (being Russian I'd know) and it is pretentious and overpriced wihout a single redeeming quality
Prices does not match with service delivery
Had a reservation, but still waited over 40 minutes
No one came to tell us anything about the status of our table
No offer to check our coats and the many bags we were lugging around
Had to take our jackets from the table (when we were finally seated) myself to the coatcheck
The staff was not friendly, even a bit snobby, and not responsive at all to guests needs
We had to ask for water and refills
Take your money elsewhere, where they are more likely to treat you like guests
We celebrated our parents' 50th anniversary at FireBird and the food, service and ambiance lived up to the occasion

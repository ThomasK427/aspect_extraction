Shilla also makes a terrific, true Dwenjangjjigae, a staple Korean stew, and Nengmyun
My friends, and even my parents and in-laws, are Shilla fans
It's also a great meeting place for a large group, and don't need to worry about making reservations, since they have three floors of seating
I've been to every restaurant in K town multiple times, so when Shilla opened I was excited to try a new restaurant
What a mistake! I expected so much but got so little, literally
The proportions are small, and the prices are expensive for what you get
The food taste okay, but it is ruined by the service
The side dishes are nothing special either
Save your money and try another restaurant
Not sure why it took so long for us to try Shilla
We went there recently with family for Korean BBQ
Having tried BBQ at all of the restaurants on 32nd, this is by far the best
Family visiting from Los Angeles also admitted it was one of the best they had
The quantity of meat is almost double that of other restaurants, and quality and marinade is the best
They also have excellent ventilation, so you don't smell as smokey as the other places when you leave
They seem to have revamped the side dishes as well
we counted 10 items plus individual salads
The decor is very modern and clean and makes all of the other BBQ places seem anitquated
No need to go anywhere else for Korean BBQ - this is simply the best in Manhattan
Definately the best new restaurant on 32nd Street! Great interior, delicious food, great service! 3 floors of seating and inviting lighting! the afterhours menu is very cheap!! must visit again!
The food is definitely different than anything in the area
The meal was refreshing and a good change of pace
I would recommend the crispy calamari and spring rolls
The wine selection was unusual but went well with the course
I'm an old fan of Bobby Van's Steakhouse
I've been eating at the midtown location regularly for about 9 years
This new downtown branch is a welcome addition to the downtown area
The food is very good
Steaks fish are excellent, but the side dishes are sometimes dissapointing (undercooked veggies, lumpy creamed spinach)
But they keep getting better each time I visit (10 times since it opened)
The service is friendly and efficient
The ambience is very NY steakhouse - brassy and noisy as you'd expect
I'm partial to the downstairs vault room, which used to be a gigantic bank vault and still has much of the original vault doors, drawers, and steel ceiling
The fare is lighter than upstairs, as are the prices
Great food, excellent service
Went in first after work with friends, and back a second time on a date
Steakhouse prices- but definitely worth it for the quality and atmosphere
Huge wine list
The Grill downstairs is very cool- not to be overlooked!
we were promptly seated when we arrived at LCG, however we sat at our table without menus for almost ten minutes, when the restaurant was only half full
The waiter let us know the specials of the evening and one of the individuals in our party ordered the special
The most expensive item on the menu was $56 - this special (consisting of one course) was $75 and the waiter neglected to mention that fact - a must if the special is that much more expensive than the most expensive menu item
I won't be back
After eating at the Prime Grill in NY and FL as well as many other fine Kosher restaurants we selected La Carne for a Passover treat after reading some reviews
We couldn't be more disappointed
Other than the service, it was a horrible experience
The steaks were dry, presentation was severely lacking on plastic dishes and the salad was tasteless
While we realize it is Passover, either don't open or don't charge $41 for a dry, tasteless filet or publish a disclaimer that the diner should beware of Passover
But then again, what does Passover have to do with not being able to serve a good steak?!
Like its sister restaurant, Prime Grill, La Carne Grill's menu is full of carnivous delights, although the menu also offers many fish and sushi options
But if you are looking for something much different from Prime Grill, you'll be disspointed
The steak was just as good, but served up the same way as Prime Grill
The roasted duck we tried was incredible
More than anything, it was the sushi that was the most memorable
It was delicious, and melted in your mouth! Best I ever had - kosher or not! Try the La Carne Grill Roll
Quiter and more quaint than Prime Grill, it offers a more date-appropriate atmosphere
The service is attentive and helpful
Just come with deep pockets!
Food was good but the service made it more worthwhile
I liked it very much
I recently had a delightful dinner here
You must have the Lobster Risotto as an appetizer
You can actually find the lobster in this dish! Then I had the Skate
it was delicious as well
The portions are generous, but not overwhelming
You must check out the unique, stylish chandelier in the back corner
I am a night person
which, by default, means I sleep very, very late
Nothing is better to me then breakfast at 3:00 in the afternooon
A friend of mine told me about this place when I was complining about having to wait until Saturday for eggs benedict
HQ serves brunch 7 days a week
hellllooooooo bloody mary!!! This is a Godsend
I still have to come in for dinner but I am definitely sold on Monday eggs and mimosas
Its about time there is a new restaurant in Soho with serious food and wine without being pretencious, and over priced
I ve eaten here twice and both times the food and service were excellent The room is intimate , sexy , but a little casual
we will be back
After a long resistance I finally stopped by for dinner
I was hoping for something better than Soho steak, but I was very disappointed
The food at the most is average, the wait staff is disoriented, the only good thing about this place is the decor
TOO bad that the person who designed it can't cook
I've eaten a few times here and I'm stunned at how overlooked this little gem is
On the upside, if you find most other places in the area overrun by people you want to beat to death with the cellphone they're flashing in the despirate hope that someone will be impressed, be sure to stop by
The staff is very attentive and the food is excellent
Unlike many other soho eateries, there's nothing exciting to say about the place other than its a good place to eat which may explain its being bypassed by the trend-sucking local crowd
The menu is simple and fairly small
there's only a few options for strict vegetarians but the fish is excellent
Brunch is worth coming out for as well
It's been a full day and I am stil daydreaming about my Fois Gras
My friend had the tuna tartare for appetizer and I thought we'd get into a fight who'd get to finish it
I am not good at discribing food, but believe me when I say that this is Fabulous! The steak came (my friend had the salmon, which she was moaning about) and as wonderful as it was, topped with grilled asparagus, I am going to rave about the polenta
Nothing like this has ever been served before
Simply amazing
Understand me when I say that I am a food snob and I bitch and bitch about everything that's wrong with so many places in the city, but this is bound to become one of my regular hang-outs (when the wallet can handle it)
The dessert was good, but I am waiting to try the Creme brulee
Went there last night for dinner and truly enjoyed it
My date had a cosmo waiting for me when I arrived and it was one of the best I'd ever had
The waiter was kind and helpful in choosing the dishes
Overall, the service was incredibly warm and the food delicious
They have created a much nicer place than the old Soho Steak
Good decor and warm feel to the place

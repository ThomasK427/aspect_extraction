The food itself is not bad, but not impressive
Oddly enough, I enjoyed the cow tongue and Kobe style beef and the menu is as beautifully decorated as the interior
Overall, this place is an establishment that serves spendy food in a pretty environment and there many places that have it beat in all categories
This is a fun place to take large group of people (which also helps to cut down on the price) but I could see how it might not be the spot for an intimate dinner for two
Much of your time you are cooking and talking to the servers which could ruin the ambiance of a romantic dinner, but this did not bother my fianc and me
I we had the house salad, which had a dressing that was so tasty, and grilled lobster, chicken, and tuna
The bibimba was great, though I have to admit I have nothing to compare the food too
We finished this meal with the smores and vowed to bring our friends next time
Its a fun time with food
I went here with 3 other people and everything we ordered was fantastic
Highly recommend the tofu salad
I know it doesn't sound like much but it's really good
And definitely get the 'smore' for dessert
i went during their 50% off sale and i thought the food tasted great, but way overpriced for small portion
i ordered quite a lot to sample different things and combinations of sauces, but was hardly full
i couldn't imagine paying twice the amount on regular days (ie
non-sale) for the same amount of food
definitely very small portions
more like bar/lounge snacks than actual meal/dinner
This restaurant may be a little pricy for BBQ
But it is worth the price
The taste is slightly different for that of Korean BBQ
The dcor is very stylish
I definitely recommend this place
My cousin took me here and the food was so delicious! I enjoyed the beef dishes and the zucchini
Also, had my first smore and that was yummy too! We ordered 3 meat dishes, 2 veggies, 1 smore and 2 soda's
The bill with tip came to $60
00 for dinner
We both left the restaurant feeling satisified but not stuffed
Next time, I will bring my boyfriend but probably will have to order more food
My only wish is that they served larger portions, but this is NYC after all
Loved it
Loved the tastes
Loved the waitress
Loved the drinks
The mouthwash in the bathroom is a good suggestion for all restaurants! Would go back any day
We had teh Samurai dinner, with a bit of everything
Left us wonderfully satisfied, yet not obesely full , which we both appreciated
The speed remarks I read? Just ask your waiter for more time between courses
easy as that
My ideal restuarant experience is one where you get cozy ambience, impeccable service, incredible food, and sit for 2 hours with your dining partner(s) and lose yourself in conversation
Unfortunately, that isn't the experience my husband and I had at Gyu-Kaku
The waiters are pushy in their service and food suggestions
The food was expensive, the portions are small, and you have to order every item a la carte
I'm willing to pay Manhattan prices for a topnotch dining experience, but not one where I feel rushed throughout the entire dinner
Additionally, you cook your own food on the barbeque at your table
We never got a chance to simply enjoy our food and get involved in a conversation, because we were too busy cooking our meal or fending off our waitress' attempts at upselling us more food
Its very nice, great food and great service
I highly recommend it
I dined here Saturday night with a group of my girlfriends
From the moment we entered the door we were all impressed
We were immediately seated, and unlike a lot of restaurants in Manhattan, we didn't have to wait until all members of our party had arrived before we were seated
Our waiter took the time to explain everything to us, and offered his personal recommendations
I don't understand the other reviews about this restaurant being overpriced
We all left completely stuffed, and the bill came out to only $50/person, including drinks
That is definitely a bargain in NYC
A fun place for a date, or for a group of friends
I will most definitely be back soon
The atmosphere, food service are excellent here
Of the 15 times i have eaten here since their soft opening have been awesome
this is better than their chain in Hawaii
Comes out to be $40 a head, which in nyc is a bargain
Great for crowds too
Decor is extremely trendy and spacious
Waiters are well trained and friendly
I HIGHLY recommend kobe toro steak and the cold noodle
Do not over cook the kobe steak though
Medium cooked steak will leave the meat juicy and tender
As for desert, the doriyaki ice-cream is a must try
Go for the happy hr special mon-fri where beer is only $2
5 a mug
I just got back from this place, and it is AWESOME! I've been to other do it yourself barbecue, but this one rules! Food is great (try the Harami miso), servers are hot, and its not expensive! All Japanese in NY is so hyped, but this one FEELS right
If you like to hang out with friends and eat great food in a happening place, GYUKAKU is it! Just gotta learn how to pronounce the name
Since I moved from Japan to NY, I missed good Yakiniku (BBQ)
Korea town is ok, but I missed Japanese style so much! This reminds me of when I used to go drinking with my friends to relax
Food is great! Meat is great! Service is great! I will go back again soon!  You have to try the Harami Miso
Sooooo good - my friends all love it
I just got home from there and I am very happy
We left very full
We had 2 pitchers of beer and plenty of food
All for $40 each for a party of 4 including tax and tip
We had a few types of beef , shrimp , vegetables and scallops
(scallops were my favorite)  This is a great place for a crowd or for a date
I will be back asap
There is a parking lot 1/2 block away
Korean: big proportions, big tastes, big (and often FREE) side dishes, free rice (and sometimes soup or neng myun), small price GyuKaku: deceptively priced to seem reasonable-- until you get your 5-midget-piece order of galbi and you realize you must order the sam (lettuce), rice, and kimchi seperately
The meat quality somewhat justifies the expense, but most people overcook their beef and ruin the point anyway
Plus, if you ask your Korean friends, I'm sure they'll name a place with great quality meat for a much much lower price
1
Look elsewhere if you're looking for traditional tastes or knowledge 2
If you eat here, don't overcook the beef-- you're paying $1-$2 per nibble so you should be able to eat it completely rare if you wanted
3
I ate the liver raw and it was good
Try it at your own risk (with a squeeze of the lemon)
I don't understand all the comments about the menu being overpriced
If you want good food, atmosphere, and service, you have to pay for it
Dinner and wine for 2 cost about $100 and we both left happily full, which about what you're going to pay anywhere else in NYC
Check this spot out - the food is delicious and you'll have a blast eating it
Had an absolute blast eating here the other night - the service is friendly and upbeat, the food is AMAZING - nothing tastes better than hot off the grill in front of you!  The back room is very nice, and quiet - other parts of the restaurant are quite energetic! The kobe beef is out of this world, I highly reccomend it to anyone who dines there!  Definitely a great find, eat here and you will absolutely come back soon!

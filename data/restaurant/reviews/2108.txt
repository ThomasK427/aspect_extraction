oily almost
It used to be described by shaking a clenched fist on a contracted bicep
Now, it's still this nice dark color, but it's frail
The Irish Oatmeal with fresh fruit still rocks my breakfast world, and the soup and half sandwich is a bargain at twice the price
The banana bread is still yummy, but no more Herculean coffee to dip it in anymore
Come back 1999 roast, we miss you!
I'm not sure what it is, but something has changed with the coffee
I really, really, really want to like this place, but I stopped going here about a year ago when the coffee started taking on a strange taste
I have never gone here and not been totally satisfied
Live and work nearby
have tried over and over to enjoy coffee, but no matter time of day it's burned/foul/ick
Food is almost always good, though, although bread for sandwiches has good days and a bad (crust to break a few teeth)
Everytime I step in to the dog friendly breakfast joint there is a line
Yes, you have to wait in line to order and nobody really waits on you, but so what
The waitstaff helps to ensure a seat by the time you order is up, and if people eat and leave (as they should in a small place w/ yummy food) there usually isn't a problem
People watching there is fun too
Who doesn't enjoy a Monica lewinsky sighting?
Damn good coffee and ambience
The location is also very quaint
GOOD FOR BREAKFAST, GREAT PANCAKES WITH BERRY TOPPING-ALSO CRUNCHY GRANOLA(GOOD WITH THE BERRIES
MAKE'S A GOOD CAPP
I think Gray Dog coffee is terrible
Tastes like licorice and it is always warm especially if milk is added
this place is just great and delivers exactly what you expect
huge and great salads and sandwiches at very fair prices
really cute ambience
it can get crowded, but they deal well with it
also can get pretty descent wine by the glass!
Grey Dog is a great cheap spot to stop in for huge sandwiches and a comfortable atmosphere
Though it occasionally gets too crowded, and the service suffers, its a small price to pay for the turkey and brie with raspberry mustard
Mood is funky and relax
The best french toast I have ever had since I lived in NYC
Very soft and tender with a thick layers of eggs and jam inside
High qaulity ham too
Delightful breakfast for Sunday
These guys make the BEST sandwiches
mmmm
perfect for any catered business lunch!
Grey Dog's simply DOES offer the best coffee in town
And they have a decent wine and beer list too for the evenings when this cafe turns into a bar
The food it decent
the service, well, it's kind of self-service but the people who work there are definitely very nice
what makes this place special is the general atmosphere (good music too!)
It's happy, fun and definitely good to your tummy (and your wallet!)
I love this place
The atmosphere is so relaxed, it feels like you're in some great country coffee house
And, your dog will equally adore the spot, as there is a jar of dog biscuits
Grey Dog is quality, great coffee and delicious food
Is a good place to go have good a meal and chat a while with your friends
Take off your proverbial leash and set your inner dog loose at Manhattan's most groovy downtown cafe
Grey Dogg's friendly San Francisco atmosphere is a real 'trip' for Manhattanites - it might take you by surprise when you get up to snag your own silverwear, but don't you worry, the scooby-doo size sandwiches served on your choice of crusty home-baked breads are guaranteed to satiate the appetite of even the biggest dogs in town!
I love to go to the Grey Dog because of the great coffee sandwiches the relaxed atmosphere
It's a unique cafe with fabulous dog photos on the exposed brick walls and plants hanging everywhere
Sometimes you have to wait a few minutes to grab a table, but it's worth the wait something always opens up
I love to meet friends there or bring people for the first time
it's a little treasure
And you can bring in your pooch if you have one!
Grey Dog has the best atmosphere of any coffeehouse I've ever been at
The food is great, the people watching is entertaining, and the casual atmosphere makes you feel like this is your neighborhood living room
don't miss the egg sandwich with the double latte
Best in class

How does the Grey Dog do it? My answer: simple food that is done to perfection
Great brunch, fantastic turkey burger, fish tacos and hearty soups make it a frequent spot for me and Spot
What a great place
Great laid back atmosphere for dog lovers and the like
They let dogs in the place and have dog treats for them
The food is great
The coffee is great
Not the typical, cheesey Village place
Very local
Not only is the coffee great, but you can enjoy it with the company of your dog
I love it, best coffee in the city
Grey Dog is the perfect place to sit and chill - with friends, or on your own
The atmosphere is always buzzing, but never intrusive
Food is great, service great
And the spiced chai latte is to die for
My perfect place to sit and chill when I need to switch off for a while
the best neighborhood spot aroundo-feels like California or the Vineyard
I'm tempted to give it a poor rating so i can selfishly keep it a secret but that wouldn't be fair to their business or to you
Great JAVA - hot or cold, fresh baked goodies, smiles behind the counter, dog art and mellow music combine to make this the #1 coffee shop in the City
Enjoy!
I don't know about the coffee, but this place has some of the best sandwiches I've ever had
They use the freshest ingredients, and the bread is especially a delight
And nothing beats the fresh-brewed lemonade on one of these hot summer days
Some might criticize the seat yourself policy, but Grey Dog is not some new world Xando/Starbucks sell-out
It's a gathering place for friends to enjoy food and drink, and the ambience only compliments that
Don't miss out!
This is definitely one of my favorite coffee places in the city
Great music, great low-key crowds, and food that reminds me of home in San Francisco
the dog serves absolutely the best coffee i have ever enjoyed in the whole world
Although crowded, Grey Dog's Coffee is well worth the wait
It really is impossible to order, because everything they have is equally tempting
The service may be a little slow (what can you expect in this laid back atmosphere), but a Sunday brunch is a rewarding experience
Down home decor fused with a classic Greenwich Village coffee house sensibility, this place is a magnet for the young and the classy
Huge, filling sandwiches (including the unique Salmon BLT), cold (or hot) chai, special salads and excellent soups establish the restaurant's gustatory chops
The clientel, however, make it a scene for creative, talented people--inlcuding a soon-to-be-famous theater director who used to waitress there! Don't miss the experience--let alone the food!
Its a little crowded at lunch time, but the Rice Krispie Treats are unbeatable and you could hide under one of the sandwiches
Great simple cup of coffee
no fuss or muss

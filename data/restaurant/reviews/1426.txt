The clientele is very hot with great girl to guy ratio
The food was awful and was expensive
All they have are Little Plates
Small tapas things for $12-15 bucks
Overall, I would not go there and give the owner the satisfaction
I was looking for a venue to host a b-day bash
I read the CitySearch reviews and talked to others but truth is, best intel was seeing the place for myself
In short, the place had a great vibe on both Fri Sat nights, good crowd, great food and the music kicks, particulary once the DJ starts spinning
Fast forward a week, I had the party there this past Sat eve and since then, I have received nothing but great feedback about the party, the venue, the service and the food from all those that attended
Should you decide to throw a party there, lock in the 16-person communal table for the night which serves as a great home base
Finally, special thanks to the owners and staff for a great night including Greg Brier (owner), Holly Roberts (GM), Samantha (Maitre'D) and the rest of the staff at Aspen
I saw the review in Vanity Fair and figured why not give it a shot
I had some of the girls from my sorority in town and wanted to show them a cool NYC place
Aspen did not disappoint
We had dinner in the back and everyone thought the food was amazing
At first the service was slow, but only because it was a crowded weekend night
We then ended up staying around for drinks even though we had originally planned to bounce around the city
Everyone had a blast and there are already plans to go back the next time the ASU girls are all in town
Didn't eat here but they do a good job making the place look like a ski lodge
The walls are painted as a forrest
and very well done
The back is all wood tables with a fire place in the middle
The longue up front is cozy and they should rethink the layout since a lot of the tables are by the front door and people constantly have to move
Service was slow at the tables so make sure you order your next round right when you get your first
Aspen not only has some of the best DJs in NYC - but the atmosphere is perfect
If you are looking for a night out and don't want to hit the club scene but would like to have good food, even better drinks and hear great music this is definitely the spot to be
The crowd is definitely good, not that fake annoying wanna be crowd
The people that hang there are actually cool
Trust me if you haven't been you should go - I've been there a few times and I will definitely be going back!
Aspen is a great place to hang out, enjoy a creative drink menu (shooting star is a favorite among this group) and an even more creative food menu
The ambience is cozy and really lends itself to a great date night or a night out with a larger group of friends
I had heard all the buzz about Aspen so my friends and I decided to go for a girls nite out
We had a great time
We were seated promptly for our 8:00 reservations and the food was great
The menu offerd a variety of choice foods to choose from
The staff was very friendly and helpful
The waiter explained everything to us
The best part was that it is tapas so you can try everything and believe me you will want to
Everyhting on the menu was good
The wine selection is broad very different, total plus
The scene is good and the crowd is as well, older and upscale, no bridge and tunnel at all
I have gone back a numerous times since
I have entertained clients there and it is an ideal place for entertaining
I highly recommend this place
One of the better places in NYC
Save your time your money!!! I went on Sat night for a bday party
Of course we waited the bouncers were actually nice (my only pro)
The bar set up made it close to impossible to get a drink if you want to even call it that!  I ordered a Belevedre Martini dry, dirty and I got something maybe vermouth half-full not cold no taste no olives
The best is that is was $13 and it was served in a smaller glass
My boyfriend got a totally the wrong drink
This happened twice and to others at the party too!  I ended up returning my Vermouth and the girl said What do you want mw to do?  ATTITUDE, hey I'm from here it's ok to have a tude but at least know how to bartend and service your clients
On a whim we walked into Aspen - having read a blurb in Vanity Fair and we actually got a table
I never had bison before and wow
they were these little burgers
SOOO GOOD the music was great and the staff really really sweet
i will certainly go back and recommend it to all my friends
A friend arranged ot have her birthday party there- they claimed they never received any word of the party when we arrived, even after her 3 phone conversations
Doorman was a jerk, we watched him let in group after group of girls- waited a ridiculous amount of time in the cold before we were rudely turned away
What a trendy, pretentious nightmare
Enjoy your 15 minutes, Aspen
We'll be elsewhere
so i got there with my friend and there's this dj playing horrible music, and the crowd is just soo bad! people from jersey, queens and let's not forget about the frat boys who just moved in to nyc!!! the food was ok, i was starving when i got there, so that helped
Went to Aspen last night after a friend had been going on about it for weeks
When we got there, we found that there was a private party going on so we couldn't go in for another 20 minutes - but the bouncer couldn't have been nicer about it and even let us wait inside the door, and then let us into the main area a few minutes later
Since we were in the middle of an office Christmas party, it was hard to tell what the regular crowd would be like, but the drinks we got were delicious and inventive (hot chocolate and raspberry tequila), and the decor was awesome, and they played great music
I will definitely go back!
I couldn't believe how great the food was at Aspen
It is a difficult area for rstauranunts, and Asoen is the perfect mix from dinner to cocktails with friends
I got to see the private dining room WOW! Hoe sexy to go through the kitchen
I will go back loyally for the fish tacos!
I am not a big fan usually of a tapis menu, but the creativity and care that went into every dish at this restaurant has turned my opinion
I loved the food, the atmosphere was a warm inviting haven to the brutal cold outside, and the staff was very attentive
The crowd was beautiful and my party of 10 people all enjoyed it so much we will definately be back soon
after reading the previous review I needed to see for myself what this Aspen place was about and I was plesantly surprised
I was greeted by a lovley lady who seated us weith no wait on a friday night and expecting the worst i ordered 2 of the small plates against whta my server advised (4) and was still hungry so i ordered to more
The food (lamb chops) are a must and the polenta fries with the gorganzola sauce are to die for
The place was cozy, the music wonderful and the service was great so before you listen to someone who clearly was not in a good mood to begin with
try it for yourself - it's a fun trip to aspen
if only for 2 hours
I just wanted to to say what fantastic time time we had 2 saturdays ago and a new place called ASPEN
Me and my friends (around 15 of us) we're looking for somewhere new to go and someome suggested this place so I will keep it short n sweet! Food 10/10 (you have to try the lamb chops 'delish!!) Drinks 10/10  Staff 10/10 Ambience and Music 11/10 (two of the best Dj's we've heard in a long time we did'nt hear a crap 50 cent record all night!) We'll be back for more
For sure!!
cant wait for this place to open
the dining room looks very fresh and the bar is cool
I was really excited when I heard about this spot, since it's the first restaurant within walking distance of my apartment, and I also completely recommend it for anyone outside of Bushwick as well, this is worth the slightly longer L ride
Cool atmosphere and yummy food, slightly on the comfort food side and delicious
Can't wait to try their brunch out
Northeast Kingdom has a wonderful feel, it's a warm, cozy and pleasant surprise in this area of Brooklyn
The prices are very reasonable
The food is quite tasty but I was disappointed how luke warm food was
I ordered the chicken pot pie and felt it would have been fantastic if was hot, i felt as though it was just microwaved
The chocolate tart was not flavorful and the texture was strange
The atmospere however was great
What a great place
in the interest of full disclosure I will admit I am a friend of the owners but this a truly a wonderful restaurant
The emphasis on quality ingredients and thoughtful presentation really shines - get the winter salad
The wine list is has some tasty and reasonably priced bottles and do not pass up the dessert selections
My fav is the banana cream pie and chocolate pudding
Take note of the diorama by the bathroom - very cool
Make the trek to Bushwick!

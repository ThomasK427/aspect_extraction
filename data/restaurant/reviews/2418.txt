Obviously the ambience is less intimate and a little less formal in the Nougatine Room, but I personally found both eating experiences enjoyable
The quality of the food such as the fish and meats is outstanding
The presentation and creativity of the dishes are also supurb
The only downside--- only 1 Female and 1 Male toilet
Seriously, in such a nice restaurant, I find it hardly acceptable to be expected to wait 10 minutes to use the bathroom!!! For a special occasion where price and value are not a problem, I highly recommend Jean Georges
I went to JEAN-GEORGES last night and i don't have words to describe my experience, well the food is amazing, the service is helpful and the ambience is a four star, the price is a little high but !we live only once! don't you think?
USA - top 10
I agree with the editorial review on this one
I have visited many many many places to eat in NYC - and the world
This is a measuring stick for food quality and service
The creativity and presentation of the food is beautiful
The service is absolutely amazing
They pay attention to every detail and dont miss a beat
Each course becomes more and more divine
Yes, a bit pricy
but if one knows how unique and creative it takes to build a menu like this, they would not even blink an eye
Save it for something very special
It is special and a jewel that helps NYC build such a respectful reputation for it's retaruant's
Food; excellent
Ambience; nice and not stuffy
Service; excellent
Prices; They gouge you on the wine list and aperitifs
Food is priced reasonably
Amazing! We had a party of 8 and evrything went perfect for my parents aniversary
The staff was more than attentive
I had the sauteed soft shell crabs for appetizer and athe loin of lamb for main dish
You must get the chocolate selection for dessert
Its heaven
Since it a place to be seen, we were actually sitting next to Donald trump and Bill O'Reilly
The prices are high, but its not like you eat here everynight
There's really nothing special about JG
His other restaurant Vong, is better-although not the main courses
For the price that JG charges, the food is not the greatest
Nothing really unique
Definitely over hyped
I like the open-kitchen style though
I visited Jean George for the first time this past Friday and was astounded any restaurant could be so perfect! We called for a reservation Friday evening and were delighted when we were told they would have a reservation available in the main dining room for 10:45
Upon arrival we were greeted with smiles and seated in the bright, white main room
Nice simple set up for an unbelievable meal
The service was very helpful in explaining the menu and giving reccomendations
The food was absolute perfection! The tuna appetizer and the lemon poached lobster were spectacular
As was the Arctic char which is quite interestingly prepard with avocado, black beans and other interesting tastes
Finally, the tasting of chocolate to finish
The best! PS
Don't forget to bring you black card
Quite pricey!
Better than s**!!! This is the best restaurant I have ever experienced! The caviar and egg is just splendid
The service top notch!!
all of what a restaurant should be
had the tasting menu, best in the city, lovely cheese platter, great desserts !!!!
i suggest eating the formal dining room
nougatine's food and service that the four star quality one would expect from a place of this caliber
Went there last Friday
The food was ok - nothing specta cular and certainly not worth the exorbitant price
Jean Georges is better every time we go
Service is always exellent, the sommelier is very helpful, and of course, the food is superb
Jean Georges has a clear passion for Asian food, since there are hints of Asian flavours in a lot of his dishes
And while food does not need to look good to taste good, he does a great job in making his dishes visually appealing
Not cheap, but definitely worth a special evening
We had the summer tasting menu
$118 a person and absolutely amazing
Service was relaxed but attentive
The 1987 Cabernet we had was just fantastic
The restaurant is one of the best in the entire world
As much as others might say that Alain Ducasse is the best French place in town, JG beats it hands down
Lives up to the hype
He's a great talent that loves NY
Lovely environment, place and experience, worth the extra few thousand calories!
Great place to celebrate our wedding anniversay this past Saturday night
The food was wonderful
I chose the $65 tasting menu and my wife ordered the $45 Prix fixe
We also ordered a nice Perrin Cotes du Rhone
We were seated in the Nougatine dining room
Sitting close to the full view kitchen was a mixed blessing
I was able to watch Jean George meticulously oversee all food preparation and service but it was also quite busy/noisy with the waitstaff frequently passing our table
The only negative was the inclusion of cooked radish slices as a garnish on my wife's poached/confit chicken entree - the taste clashed
At the end of the meal, unbidden, our waiter brought a Happy Anniversary treat - assortment of chocolates and candies on a candle lit tray
A very classy touch
Try the tasting menu
stay awhile
Simply incredible, excellent service and refined, yet unique setting
Superb
WEDS NIGHT WAS ONE OF THE BEST MEALS OF MY LIFE
MY BOYFRIEND AND I EAT OUT A LOT BECAUSE HE IS A COOK
THE FLAVORS WERE SO VIBRANT AND CLEAN IT WAS AMAZING
EVERY DISH HAD SOME COMPONENT THAT SENT IT OVER THE EDGE
LOBSTER WITH TAPIOCA HAD GEUWURTRAMINER FOAM, THEN PASSION FRUIT REDUCTION WAS DRIZZLED AT THE TABLE
PERFECT BALANCE OF SWEET, SOUR AND BUTTERY LUSCIOUSNESS
SOFT SHELL CRABS WITH SHISO MAYONNAISE AND OF ALL THINGS BIBB LETTUCE
SO REFRESHING AND CLEAN, COURSE AFTER COURSE LEFT US SPEECHLESS
WE CANT WAIT TO RETURN(AS SOON AS WE CAN AFFORD IT)WINES WERE A LITTLE MISMATCHED, BUT SERVICE WAS SWEET AND SEAMLESS
It is difficult for this reader to understand the previous review
This is a restaurant that focuses on creating meals which make memories
The tasting menu offers a world of flavors and textures to the sophisticated palate
The decor is elegant yet simple, and the waitstaff has impeccable timing
A restaurant of this caliber should help the diner focus on the food, not create atmosphere to detract from it
This restaurant continues to be one of the best meals in the city
I had high expectations for this place
Very average all around
Attracts an older (45 plus) crowd

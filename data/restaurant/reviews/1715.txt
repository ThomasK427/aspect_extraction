I am most picky about Italian food and I must say that Lavagna did not disappoint
It is a very cozy restaurant with excellent serivce and the food is superb
The portions are large and hearty (espeically the pasta with sausage) and the specials were just as appetizing as the main menu
I can't wait to go back for more!
the neighborhood surrounding it might have been a little sketchy, especially for out-of-towners, but it was well worth it
the restaurant has an intimate, cozy feel to it
the skate fish and shell steak were just so divine
both just melted right in my mouth
the staff was friendly, and the price was right
i definitely would like to come back on my next trip to nyc!
I dined at Lavagna just two weeks ago, on a Friday, and all I have to say is it was so yummy
I went with a group of 6 people, and I really think that 6 should be the ultimate max at this place because otherwise, it'll be a bit too tight and uncomfy
The pre-fixe for $25 is a great deal for those who can fit dessert in their stomach
I opted for the Baby Arugula salad
As for my main course, I got the Rigatoni with sausage in a cream sauce
My Rigatoni dish ended being the most delicious pasta dish I've tasting thus far, and it is also HUGE
In summary, the pre-fixe is a great deal
Tasty food, nice ambiance, good for a date, or a party of 6
Everyone in my party enjoyed the food so much, that we vowed to come back really soon
We had a friend in town this Saturday and wanted to have a nice dinner
There were 6 of us for dinner
All the food was absolutely delicious! Yes, this is a romantic place, but we did not feel out of place
Each of us had something different
We had mussels, and a pizzeta for the table, and they were yummy
We had the pastas, lamb chops and steak
All were excellent
While we were there, we saw the specialty fish of the day for 2 on fire (flambe)
I'll be trying that on my return
We had a wonderful meal there the other night - Octopus Carpaccio and great pasta and pizzas
The service is friendly and efficient, and the value is unbelievable
Also check out the wine list
We had a great time here the other night
until the bill came
Half of us ordered prix fixe deals, the other half didn't--but they went ahead and took the liberty to count one order as a prix fixe deal, which is fine, if they had explained it as they brought our bill
Since they didn't, we were confused
The waitress was patient and understanding but the bartender (owner?) who did the billing walked over in a huge sissy fit about how there was nothing wrong with the bill
We told him to watch his tone--and he went off even more about how busy the place was
Talk about attitude! It's really too bad, because aside from that damper, the place was great
I know the food is amazing and I'm sure the restaurant will continue to prosper, but it has definitely lost my business for good!
Been coming to this place for years its still the best restaurant in the East Village, despite all the recent competition
Three Star dining at $25 or Under prices, an excellent waitstaff (most have been there since its opening), attractive intimate room, creative menu, inexpensive wine list a desserts that rival most patisseries, LaVagna is the best dining deal in Manhattan
Reservations are a MUST if you're eating after 7:30 weekdays or on weekends as LaVagna is a much loved local place
For an incredible deal go early--the prixe fixe avaialable from 6:30 to 7:15 is only $25 includes appetizer, main dessert
Ask for the whole fish for 2--its always the best meal oin the menu
We had to wait for 30 minutes to be seated and had to wait outside in the cold because the place is so cramped
The host guy is very rushed and overwhelmed as is the rest of the staff who seem like they'd rather be anywhere else than there
The pasta is fine, but the rest of the food is amateurishly prepared (either oversalted or bland)
I don't see why Citysearch gives them a star for being romantic as this is absolutely not the case, unless cramped quarters and noise turn you on
There are so many other great places in this area that I think this one can simply be skipped
Really lousy
My boyfriend and I made reservations here for New Year's Eve and were disappointed
Service was abrupt and we felt very rushed
Table was cramped
Food was overall mediocre
I ordered filet mignon carpaccio, and received a very small portion of meat that had been shreaded and molded into the shape of a slice
My boyfriend's oysters were oversalted and a bit sandy, his duck nothing special and our panna cotta undercooked
Overall, my pasta entree was the best dish and in my opinion that doesn't say much for the cuisine considering all the excellent alternatives nearby
My boyfriend and I just happened upon this jewel of a restaurant in the East Village, and I fell in love immediately
About as romantic as it gets, Lavagna is sprinkled with white lights and small, intimate tables
The service was excellent, and the food was divine
My boyfriend had a crab risotto that was unbelievable; my ordinary pasta turned out to be extraordinary
I highly recommend Lavagna for a romantic evening
or any evening, for that matter
For all the hype I have read about Lavagna, it did not even come close! My party wasn't seated until an hour after our resevation
We were basically kicked out of the restaurant for that hour and when I decided to wait at the bar, I was then yelled at by the manager!! Not just please don't sit here, the manager was in my face screaming at me! I have never been treated more rudely as a paying customer
Top off the miserable waiting experience with mediocre food and service and you have a ruined Saturday night
After the way I was treated I will never step foot in that restaurant again
Ate here dinner last Tuesday after reading reviews and checking out website
Lamb main was great, tasty although slightly overdone for my medium rare taste
My friend had the special Alaskan Sea Bass and thought it was bland, didn't like it at all
We had the Arugula salad which was good and initially the white bottle of wine we ordered was insufficiently cold
Ambience was nice with open air street dining, however extremely noisy inside
Overall average considering one has to walk out there
There are better places in this city
Yummy food, graet wine list but the best was the dessert
amazing
The place is so romantic that i went there for my first date!!Its worth
do not miss this restaurant
it's been open for years and has not declined in quality one bit
service is attentive, eager and kind, and the food is simply fantastic, especially given how low the prices are
i will continue to come back here again and again
Lavagna was a great discovery from Citysearch
Wanted to try some honest Italian fare in an inexpensive, romantic setting
This is a great date place
The food was cooked to perfection
No complaints what-so-ever and the pricing is easy on the wallet too
The seared scallop appetizer was fantastic, the only down side was it only served two scallops, it was so great it left me craving for more! The entrees were cooked just right and the aroma and textures were excellent
We did not get to try the pasta or pizzas, though we plan to the next time we come back
They also have an extensive wine list to choose from, which is a plus
Absolutely take advantage of the prix-fixed menu offer if you are an early diner, its well worth the money
They take reservations, but by 7:30pm it will most likely be booked
Couln't be better! THE best Italian place in the neighborhood! Forget the others, the food, atmosphere and wines far surpass those of any other place I've tried around here
Loved it
This place has a very nice ambiance, decor, vibe, etc
The food was very nicely prepared, even though some of the dishes weren't necessarily my type
The proscuitto appetizer with figs and some type of little bread was excellent
The angel hair pasta with tomato sauce looked very nice, but was not to my liking, as the sauce was very spicy
We got one of the specials
a rockfish with creamy potatoes, corn and black truffle sauce
Overall the dish was excellent, although the texture of the fish was too rubbery for me

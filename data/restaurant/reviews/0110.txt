sat there for a good 15 mins before we got our check, while a bunch of people were waiting outside for a table
I got the distinct impression that someone was working very hard to create eccentric breakfast dishes from some traditional ingredients
There are a lot of eggs and canadian bacon, so this is not the place for vegetarians and some of the experimental dishes fail
However, the drinks are very good and this place is alright for brunch, if you don't mind sitting in a very cramped spot and/or waiting on line
Second time at Prune was equally as good as the first
We waited without a reservation for an hour on a Monday night but it was well worth it
I love the innovative menu - simplicity at its best
The chef allows the natural flavors of the food to shine using modest but wonderful intrusions of other seasonings in each dish
The food was very good, but I wish the host was more realistic about expected wait time
At first he said it would be 1hr (starting at 12 Noon), but we got seated only at about 2PM (it became 2 hrs wait)
I had a steak with eggs, it was very good but not big enough so I left a little hungry afterall
We were seated downstairs, where the smell of dishwasher definitely overwhelmed my brunch
Prune made us wait standing up for 30 mins, even with a reservation
The lamb I ordered was badly cooked, fatty, and relatively tasteless
The coffee arrived cold
The music was turned up so loud I couldn't hear my friends talk
Our bill, for 4 people, came to $306
That money could really have been much better spent
The food here is really amazing
Having frequented Prune twice, I think that my second meal was even more enjoyable
If you like savory this is a fantastic place with a great bar menu that includes white anchovies and other great picks
The main menu offers interesting dishes like sweetbreads with capers, chestnuts with ricotta, beets with goat cheese, etc
Ordering a number of dishes and sharing is highly recommended
My only complaint was the service--which may be this particular waitress--she filled our champagne glasses to the brim! Otherwise bon apetit!
I had heard great things about this place
Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best, expensive, and served on small chipped plates, and in minimal quantities
The service, while cheerful and friendly, was very very slow
The restaurant, on a cold winter evening, was freezing, and the seats were hard and cramped
Why anyone would travel to the lower east side when there are a hundred famous NYC restaurants with beautiful decor and great food is beyond me
Go to the toilet before you dine, or be prepared to sit in a windowed toilet with an iffy lock two feet away from patrons dining
Since you could easily listen in on their conversation, they most probably could share your procedures as well
I've eaten at Prune a number of times for breakfast on the weekend
The dishes always feel very special and unique
dishes such as a fluffy pancake' with slices of apple (or was it pear?) artfully arranged on one side
A light dish of farmer's cheese, with fresh figs and pignoli
Canadian bacon
The most delectable fresh fruit dish, with I think Ruby Red Grapefruit, grapes, raspberries, and what's that larger berry
and a beautiful sauce with fresh mint
I've always enjoyed my breakfast there
We've never had to wait more than 5 mins
for a table
Prune just doesn't live up to the hype
This used to be a good place, lively but not packed, good food, good vibe
Now I think their success has gone to their heads
Maybe it was an off night, but the food was mediocre at best (the famed marrow bones were so over-roasted the marrow was a puddle of grease on the plate), the service friendly but very haphazard, and the quality of the experience did not justify the prices
Prune works as a good neighborhood restaurant, but not as a destination restaurant--it simply isn't worth the trip if you don't live in the East Village
I am not from NYC but hate all the trendy tourist traps expecially around the holidays
A friend reccommended this quaint place in the east village for breakfast
It took awhile to find the location as it is hidden not in the best neighborhood, but the masses waiting to eat told us it was probably worth it
The food was excellent, bloody mary bar and great service is why I would reccommend it to anyone
Probably one of the best brunch experiences I have had
We waited for a millenium for a table on Saturday, but is was worth it
Unique items on the menu, that were all well implemented
A very creative approach to food and eating as you enjoy the dishes of Gabrielle Hamilton and observe how calmly she crafts each plate
You will not be disappointed if you can appreciate food and how it can be creatively presented
My friend Eddy took me here for the 1st time for brunch last Sunday and it was awesome
The place is cramped, but the wonderful thing is you get a cool scene with a nice-looking crowd and neither the patrons nor the staff have attitude
The food is also very good and inexpensive
Highly recommended
i love prune
the food is incredible, simple and yet very interesting
don't miss the sardine appetizer, the rabbit stew, or the deviled eggs
great selection of booze
the only problem with this place is that it is tiny
even wiith a reservation, be prepared to wait, but it's worth it
Yes, it's tiny, and the tables are crammed in like sardines in a can, but the food is exquisite!  Gabrielle Hamilton really knows what she is doing with her juxtaposition of flavors and textures
Her Monkfish Liver with warm toast is simple but uniquely delicious
Just one of a number of fabulous flavors we experienced at Prune
and the service was exemplary
Whomever is buying the wine is selecting tasty choices at reasonable prices
Go THERE!
The food tasted like it came straight out of some ethnic gradmama's oven
straightforward and damn good
The menu is exciting but not pretentious, flavors are elemental but not subtle
sweetbreads and bacon puts you right at home on a couch w/ the remote
However, dining there on a recent summer night also reminded me how hot it was when grandma didnt put here a/c on
It was hard slicing into heavenly crunchy pork roast when sweat was stinging my eyes
In the end, our happy, jig-dancing, song-belting waitress wilted into condescending and dehydrated into snooty by checktime
Go, by all means, but tune in to the weather before you do
I'll go back in the fall
Prune is one of those fabulous little restaurants that makes you glad you live in the city
Getting a table can be tough, but if you are prepared to perch on a stool at the bar, that can be more fun
Bar and wait staff very friendly, and the cocktails are potent (beware all stool-perchers)
I recommend the soft shell crabs above everything
This little gem bucks the trends of fine dining
Small, intimate, and crowded, Prune feels like dining in another country, say France, where eating at restaurants is not meant to be a trip to the mall or salon
What I liked best about Prune were the unusual tastes, so hard to find in a city that increasingly caters to the surburbanite palate
I would rank Prune as not only one of my favorite restaurants visited, but also one of the best
From the engaging staff to the inspiring dishes, it represents a fantastic place to reconnect with old friends or have a romantic dinner
Try to sample one of the deserts, they're unique and delicious
Reading the few negative reviews of Prune just crystallizes the notion that idiots should go to caliente cab co
and leave the good restaurants to the rest of us
One of the most inventive menus in town, with the most incredible taste to match
This is truly a place where people who love food go
This is Bourdain's adventures in eating right here in NYC
The space is small, so what? Its a little chilly in winter, who cares? Eat the freakin food and quit whining or go eat at taco bell where you belong
good, solid food and very helpful service but overpriced
the dishes are a little too recherche and too trendy for their own good and there is not enough on the menu for vegetarians
but maybe that's intentional ;-)
pleasant little nook downstairs ideal for parties up to 7-8

Another thing was the space and decor, all authentic Japanese decorations, spacious with high ceilings make the cavernous dining area very intimate and delightful
Service was prompt and attentive, which is another big plus in a busy Japanese restaurant
Call ahead and arrive before 7pm for good seating
The food was absolutely delicious
I was excited to stumble on such a great find in China Town and we all know how difficult that can be
This place is easy to find and offers delectable cuisine
The Eggplant in Garlic Sauce was fantastic along with the Beef and Broccoli
Its a great place to take a visiting friend when they want some really good authentic chinese food
Plus, they will get the added bonus of getting to see China Town and then hopping over to Little Italy for some great deserts
Don't wait at the original Joes
just walk down the street and get the same thing
O
k
, but I don't understand the rave reviews this place gets in the paper
Maybe I am just bored with Chinese food
For a really nice dinner, I would rather go up to Little Taipei
As a Chinese, I would not want to have Chinese cusine in New York
However, my cousin who has been in New York for 2 years, has highly recommend the steam dumpling to us
therefore, we gave it a try
Wow! I never had a steam dumpling that good! It's better than those I have in Los Angeles, in Hong Kong, and even in China!  My brother has also ordered a marinated raw crab
When we saw the green crab on the table, we hesitated to eat it
coz it is really a green, raw crab
We have to eat is as we have ordered it
Again, the taste is very yummy!!!
I have gone to Joes on Pell st for years now and this addition is welcomed
The dumplings are great and its nice to have another place to get them at
This is all brand new so it's all very clean and lovely
Highly recommended for a cheap meal
You can bring your own wine if you like as well
The Scene The affable Valenti is up to his elbows in the wood-burning oven one minute, and chatting with old friends in the chocolate-colored velvet booths the next
The warm, Mission-inspired ramble of rooms, done up with dark wood, botanical frescos and elaborate wrought-iron chandeliers, are plush enough to make diners feel special, yet comfortable enough to preclude pretension
Friendly and formal service follows suit
The Food Valenti's cooking is soulful and hearty
His smoked speck ham underlying poached egg-rucola Parmesan cups, and fresh ricotta with house-marinated artichokes showcase stellar ingredients
Sweet shrimp raviolini sprinkled with intensely herby bread crumbs is elegant; a dreamy ragu-laced baked ziti draped with molten Parmesan cream is rustic yet refined
Grilled lamb loin and sausage with herbed cauliflower stew, and pancetta-wrapped calves' liver with almost-too-strong agrodolce sauce, satisfy comfort cravings
For dessert, the perfectly textured panna cotta with blood orange compote cannot be beat
Cesca offers something most New York restaurants have forgotten about
The entire package, dining experience; from soup to nuts
There is a new chef, Kevin Garcia, who is outstanding
I had dined here many times before, but now it is out of this world
The pastas are homemade, the ingredients are fresh and the quality of each dish is remarkable
I highly recommend the pastas, salads, tuna and scallops
Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything
The ambience is wonderful
It really caters to all
If you have tried it in the past, go back
This new chef is outstanding and has a promising career
I would have to say it is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan
Talk about a pleasant surprise!
Upon our arrival for dinner, the bar was hoping, the crowd good-looking and the decor top-notch
I found the staff to be very knowledgeable and friendly, and upon our waiter's recommendation, ordered the duck ravioli which was unbelievable
The risotto was terrific
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys their food as I do, but beware of the bar prices
I ordered a Martini which set me back $17!!!
The rice balls and the parmesan fritters are beyond excellent
There is a large variety of wine at many different prices
We had a bottle for $24 and it was very good
The drinks are made fresh and are delicious
The drinks were $11
The bread is excellent
But beware of salt
The faro was inedible because of so much salt
However, the waitress did take it off our bill
Go, but ask for no salt
Cesca's ambiance is quite nice when you walk in
their menu looks good though somewhat limited (for italian)
Started with their clams spicy chorizo (sausage) which to my disappointment was not spicy, quite bland lacking in flavor
Had the scallops for the main with a side of risotto
The scallops were tasty - however nothing outrageous
The risotto side however is quite possibly the best thing on the menu
The italian cheesecake is creatively presented however is regular cheescake (not ricotta) - which was also a disappointment
My wife and I had a reservation nearly two months in advance for dinner at 7:00 PM with two of our dear friends
The day before our reservation, the restaurant called us to be sure that we were going to be there for our 7:30 PM reservation
Even though the time had slipped 30 minutes we said yes
When we arrived at 7:30 PM the next day the maitre d asked us if we were sure we had a reservation
My wife said yes, and told her that it was confirmed the day before
The maitre d then said our reservation was for 8:30 PM
The restaurant is very loud The help is snobby Nobody came by to ask if everything was ok
the food was not that good  the positive is if you want to see someone famous this is the place
the really need to improve their service and give them a personality
The worst service I've had in recent memory
When asked to leave off the an item from the entree, was told no substitutions off the menu
When asked if there was a fan blowing, was told it's on a timer and the server walked away
Utimately changed tables and servers, and $80 per person later, left wishing I'd never stepped foot in the door
Never again
Ate their last night for the first time
Place was packed and lively despite being a Monday night
Our large party was promptly seated and went on to experience a great meal in a fun, pretty, people-watching room
The extensive menu had something for everyone and despite the high accolades this restaurant has received, it's not overly expensive
Definitely go!
Heard about CESCA for some time and was looking forward to a wonderful meal
The ambiance was great
While the drinks were pricey, didn't care because expected great meal
What we were treated to, instead, was snooty attitude by the waiter and the maitre d' and a dinner I couldn't eat
I ordered the tuna black and blue
The waiter told me that the chef only cooks it one way and that is rare
Good enough for me, given his reputation
Well, it was not rare, it was medium
Then, the maitre d' tells me that it was rare, because he touched it and it was cold in the center

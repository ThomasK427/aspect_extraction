There is opportunity to add in the wine list
To come clean - I dined only in the next door Tea Room as the main dining room was full at the time
The tea room is an intimate, spill over area
The tea wasn't much good, the menu and the food was pretty much the same as the $5 curry row fare and the waiter need constant prodding
If I need a cheap curry fix, I won't be returning
We sat at the bar to try out a couple of snacks and have drinks - if we liked it we thought we'd get a table
We never got around to the table - we were treated so shabbily and insultingly by the bartender we ended up leaving
What is with this place?
VERY GOOD FOOD AND SERVICE WE WERE 8 OFF US THE WAITER HE HELP US TO CHOICE AND MIX APPT
AND MAIN DISHES AND WINE VERY GOOD WAITER WAS SO NICE AND CHARMING MAN
THANKS
TO VACK AND TAMARIND
AND OWNER HE IS SO NICE MAN
I absolutely love this restaurant
The staff is lovely, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is tranquil
I highly recommend
I went there for lunch on my birthday and I was treated like a princess
I don't care how great the food is
We were treated in a completely unacceptable fashion
Went during rest week, even took time off work for it
Arrived just a hair past 3:00 for reservation at same time only to be told that kitchen had closed
We have your reservation but too bad, essentially
They tried to throw us into the empty, closed tea bar
The hostess and mgr said that we had arrived at 3:05 - too late
They offered the regular menu at regular price, and then said that only two of four restaurant week menu items were available
THEN the waiters chided us for arriving at 3:05
We left and will NEVER ever go back
The food is fantastic at Tamarind
Unfortunately, even with reservations, we waited 1 HOUR last Saturday night
The hostesses beamed vacous smiles at us whenever we enquired about our table
they're useless
Our waiter was an airhead, but the food is magnificent, nonetheless
Just don't go there on Friday or Saturday night during any reasonable dining hours
Charming settings embraced us
We were regaled by the shimmer of the lamps
Alas! Only if would have translated similarly into the food and service
They were poor at best
Cold food served in dirty plates
Waiters seemed to care little about how we felt
Managers seemed oblivious to the guests, they were picking their noses even as we were eyeing for their attention
Tamarind could have been great
But it was sadly far from that
The Scene Expats and curious Americans have been popping into Tea and Sympathy to sample the curiosities of British cuisine for years
Now they only have to go next door to find authentic fish 'n' chips, wrapped in a London newspaper to boot
The Food The key element to a proper British chip is fat, and the flabby, pale yellow specimens here come close to the ideal
If you really love them, try the chip buttie (a chip sandwich, essentially)
Either way, salt and vinegar are essential
It's probably best to stick to the simpler fish dishes (halibut, salmon, whiting and cod plus lots of crispy batter); variations like fish cakes are less reliable
Don't be afraid of the deep-fried Mars Bar for dessert: it's delicious
I'll recommend it, just
I've been to many better fish n chip places and will probably go to just as many better ones in the future
First of all, stick to the cod which is excellent and prepared as it should be; firm and flaky and in a good, sensibly thick batter
They haven't perfected the chips yet
I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that maybe US species don't chip as well -- who knows
Too brown and old tasting - Can't put my finger on it
If you're British and have memories of ordering a large cod and chips, think first
You get two decent sized pieces of fish, but a massive shoebox-sized container of chips which only emphasizes their mediocrity
Try the Idris Firey Ginger Beer - great stuff
Don't even try to sit inside because the air's pretty thick and the ventilation nowhere
The place could use a mop, and the staff some shampoo - proper British chippies are clean -- really
Sit on the benches outside and watch the people go by
In all, a remarkably average experience, in a place I wanted to visit
One time will probably do for now
New York is a tough place and has probably the best and most varied food choices anywhere
A Salt and Battery is fine if you absolutely have to have fish and chips and are in the Village
Otherwise there are a multitude of places for three people to take their 44 dining dollars, as a superlative Little Italy meal the next day proved, even leaving change for 2 of our 3 subway tickets
Fish and chips shop
fish not fresh
criminal
Tried twice now and gave the benefit of the doubt, but worse second time
Skip it
On a beautiful day in nyc great to eat on outdoors me and my husband got fries and fish our fish was delicious great as always but our fries it was a another story very dark and burn
Best fish in nyc BIG PORTIONS
I've been in the US for 3 years, and this is the first place I've found that makes (what I as a Kiwi) would call genuine fish chips
A bit pricey, but that's to be expected in NY
Only a small waiting/eating area with a few bar stools - this is not a restuarant
Offers a range of fish, chips, and other fried foods, pies, fritters sides (including baked beans mushy peas) plus British drinks and beers
Delicious!!
Braveheart thought he got pillaged
he hasn't seen nothing! The $11 portion was small, the breading was soggy, and fries cost extra
The irony of it all is that I tried the fish and chips at a sports bar across the street the following week, 1/2 the price (w/fries included), and the portion was bigger and much tastier
FREEEDOM!!
This has to be one of the worst Fish n Chips meals I have ever had
The fish was OK, at best, and the large is more like a small, but the chips were thoroughly disgusting
The potatoes they used were old, soggy and very bad quality as well as over cooked and almost all of them were covered in black eyes and of a slight black colour throughout
If you are British and you are feeling nostalgic and wanted a bit of home in NYC, save yourself the disappointment and don't ruin the memory of how a nice portion of fish and chips tastes
If you are not British please do not tar all English Fish n Chips with the same brush
The service was rude (at least that was authentic!) and the price was expensive
In summary, I feel like I have been violated by these charlatans!
When you're craving fish and chips, this place definitely hits the spot
It will probably run about $12 but this is NY (and whoever stated that a portion of fish and chips in England runs about $2 is certianly not eating in London)
It's actually less greasy than most fish and chip shops, although its certainly not very nutritious, and the fish is fairly fresh for a chippie
So every once in a while, enjoy!
I love London and I love this place
The fish and chips are the best this side of the Atlantic
The cod is crunchy and flaky
I just wish the portions were a little bigger
To complete the mood, they have a good selection of English sodas and drinks to go with your meal
Food is kinda pricey but much cheaper than an airline ticket to England
From all the other reviews posted you can prolly get a good read of the place

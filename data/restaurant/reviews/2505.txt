Pampa has increased their p/p minimum to $30 (remember, cash only!) coupled with the fact that they are not children friendly, I have decied to call them Pompous
They are not the only game in town anymore, even on the Upper West Side!
This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time
Despite the fact that the owner approached us more than once to rush us to finish (we were the largest party there at the time; 24 people) and leave, so that the next group could take our table, I keep returning to this savory Argentine steak house that offers great values
All the food from the salads, to the steak, to the delicious desserts promises a worthy trip up to West 97th Street
In the end, everyone was accomodated, but not until we desperately tried several to reason with the owner
Unfortunately, the motto the client is always right does not hold here
Bottom line: well worth it, but go for the food, not the management
I don't understand how anyone could not love this place - especially at these prices! A steak so huge it doesn't fit on the plate will cost you 15 dollars, 17 max, and a huge platter of fries is just 4 dollars
Even as a poor college student I scrape together enough to visit this place close to twice a month, and the (skirt) steaks and apple crepes have a beautiful flavor that make all the scrimping and saving worth it
You can make reservations, just be sure to arrive promptly or you'll lose it
Pampa is perfect! It is a great spot if you enjoy meat, candlelight, wine, dulce de leche and a great crowd
Ambience is warm and romantic
If you don't like laughter and noise, then this crowd is not for you
The service is good and friendly
The meat is wonderful, definitely not for vegetarians! Don't bother with the soup or salad
that's not what Pampa-devotees go there for anyway! Be sure to try the panqueque con dulce de leche
It is so delicious! On any given night, you can spot some pro Argentine tango-ers having dinner and drinks there
If you haven't been there yet, go right now!!!!
Good steaks, cooked as ordered and terrific with the chimichuri sauce
Nice caramel crepes
If your looking for sophistication or inventive, not for you
Otherwise a very pleasant and reasonable priced experience
A lot less stiff and masculine than most steak places
fine beef, good prices but very loud
too bad they don't take reservations
I think that argentine cuisine can be match more interesting better that the insipid expirience that I had in this overpriced place
The service was medicre and me cobraron hasta el cafe!! I think that I am going to gibe it an other chance, because I had very good argentine food in Downtown, let see
The waiters are dressed in black like door men
The place looks like a wine celler with dim lighting, they have more tables sqeezed in than an classroom
The are also not child friendly
No baby seats
The food takes far too long
The steak has nothing to do with Argentinian food
Infact they dont have much Argentian food at all on their menu
They also have a $20 minimum cash only policy which can be an inconvenience at times
I went here with a couple buddies
I have been to Argentina a few times, so I knew what to expect
The service was Great
The food was Great
If you go you have to drink Quillmes
It is a great Argentine beer
Funny, it only costs 1
5 pesos in Argentina though
With the devalutiaon of the Peso that is the equivlant of about
30 cents
I would recommend this place
Only problem is that if you want to enjoy Mate, you have to but the whole set
Who knew you could find really good steak in Manhattan Valley? The portions are generous and the steak is tender, savory and very well priced
Grab some friends and hang out in the garden in back
The Scene Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too and its Central Harlem sister restaurant, Miss Maude's, boast the same hospitable "y'all come back now ya hear" feel, one that makes Columbia students, adventurous yuppies, decked-out church ladies and national dignitaries feel equally at home
Decor includes kitschy strawberry curtains, historic Harlem pictures and personal family photos
The Food Guiltily scarf down fried catfish sandwiches and collard greens, or try Clinton's favorite: short ribs and fried chicken
Some patrons skip the main course altogether and fill up on side dishes like buttery corn bread, creamy mashed potatoes, grits, and macaroni and cheese
But make sure you leave room for dessert: the fruit cobbler, banana bread pudding and apple pie are favorites
Half iced tea, half lemonade, smothered chicken, mac n cheese, yams
And I'm spent
The food is what soul food is supposed to be, the place is comfortable and folks are kind
They may take a little longer to get to your table but this isn't McDonald's, ya know?
The fried chicken is amazing- which is my personal bar of how good any soulfood is! And then try some coconut cake which is light and soft and moist and actually really tastes like coconut! You may not think to try the fries- but they are the best spiced in NYC and not too salty, either
I love the collard greens, too
And the mac cheese
It's relaxed and homey and everyone there is super sweet! The decor is photographs of family- which are beautiful, surrounded by what feels like a real sit-in, souuthernnn kitchen! It's exactly where you want to be - enjoying great food with people you love and worrying about nothing! AND you can sit outside - in the evening it is beauitful, across from the park!
Being from the south (the deep south), I was excited to read all of the rave reviews about Mamie's spoonbread, and even more excited to go try out the comfort food
Well, I was horribly let down
I ordered the catfish, the candied yams, and macaroni
and the catfish was not good at all (in fact, I thought about asking if I could go back to the kitchen and cook it myself, seeing that I know I could have made it better), the candied yams weren't quite candied
the syrup was runney and not flavorful, and the macaroni was, to say the least, mediocre
Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time or your money
I assure you you're not missing out on anything special
I went here and the service totally stunk
the waitress was slow and forgot our drinks about 3 times
The food is worth it if you like having fried, greasy food
The only dish I did enjoy was the side orders of sweet potatoes and collard greens
We waited well over an hour for our food, without so much as some water or bread, and then the food arrived cold
And was some of the worst soul food I've ever had (and I've had a lot of it as I grew up in the South)
The Mac and Cheese was worse than a school cafeteria, the fries and catfish were soggy, the fried chicken was dry, and the sweet tea was plain nasty (nor did they bother to refill our glassed even once)
In short, bad food and some of the worst service I've ever had - even though it was not busy
A waste of time and money ($45 for two)
I love Spoonbread
The food is great
The staff is great
Sometimes the service is a little slow, but I don't mind because the ambience is cool and good things come to those who wait
And the food here is a good thing
I live in NJ where there are lots of good restaurants
But I'm in the city a lot and I always try to stop at Spoonbread
The fried chicken is out of this world, the sweet tea is excellent, and the desserts are tasty tasty tasty
I've always had good service (friendly and quick), whether the restaurant was crowded or not
One of my favorites!
I've been here twice and I am so dissapointed with the service
Regulars get their food first, no matter how long you've been sitting there prior to their arrival
This happened on two different visits, and it's sad that this is how Mamie's run their operation
There are plenty of other soul food restaurants in the area, and I would suggest you visit those
Ignore this place, unless you want to wait an hour for your so-so fried chicken
We Loved the sample portions available at the Black Fine Art Show and attributed the poor service there to crowds and poor space
Little did we know that this foreshadowed the exceptionally rude, service from one (male) waiter in the restaurant
We were not served bread or water until we left the table twice to request
Our appetizer arrived after the entree
without apology and a nasty comment when it was refused
This waiter had major attitude and the smothered chicken was too salty

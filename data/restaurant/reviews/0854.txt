One bottle was produced after much debate
The worst offense by far was our expensive bottle of wine was a no show up until the middle of the entre 30 minutes later and only then after some considerable struggle
Refined southern food with a French twist its not
The food was above average but not as good as it could be
When I order chicken and mini dumplings, I want dumplings not spetzel
I went with a large party (8 people) and no one came to our table for over 15 minutes to greet us
After that, it took another 10 minutes to bring over the wine and they had run out of bread
All around, the service was extremely poor
Although the food was excellent, I would not recommend this restaurant for a large group
I HAVE BEEN TO THIS WONDERFUL NEW RESTAURANT A FEW TIMES FOR DINNER AND JUST TO HANG OUT AND HAVE DRINKS
THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS GREAT
THE TUNA WAS FANTASTIC AND THE BEET SALAD CAN'T BE BEAT! THE DESERTS ARE EXTRODANARY SO WE TRIED A DIFFERENT ONE EVERYTIME WE WERE THERE
IF YOU HAVENT GONE YET PUT THIS ONE ON YOUR LIST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
CALL FOR A RESERVATION I HEAR THAT WORD IS GETTING AROUND AND EVERYONE IS ENJOYING THS NEW RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK CITY
What a great new place! I just went for dinner after a friend suggested we try it and wow! The food was delicate and well presented and the taste was superb! I have the pumpin ravioli in a chive nutmeg butter
excellent! Again
so delicate
The ambiance was quite well also
a warm ocean blue velvet color with rich art and very chabby chic chandeliers
Loved it! The Chef came to say hello which was also a treat!
I've been eating at La Villa about 3 times a month since they opened, and I think that some of you must be eating in a different restaurant from the one that I go to
Bad service? Burnt pizza? Oily food? You have got to be kidding! Once there was a problem with my order and I let my waiter know
The dish was taken away at once, no questions asked, with an apology
A few minutes later the newly cooked dish came to my table
The waiter made sure it was done right
One of the owners apologized to me
and did not charge me for the dish
I was already a fan of La Villa, but that made me feel like it was my restaurant
Oh, the first poster EH
it's not a pizza joint, just like LeBarnadin isn't a fish shack
It's a pizza restaurant, that's why the no slices policy
Food here is good, BUT they tend to burn the pizzas
Also they tend to use too much salt
I almost always call and pick up the order and they consistently get it wrong
Almost like they forget what is supposed to go in their dishes
Also dining in you get more than picking up or having it delivered (bread with some dishes, extra chicken etc
) Yet it cost the same
Speaking of cost, they are expensive for lunch
$9-$13 for heros plus tax
Pizzas about 20 bucks
Again the food is good, but nothing exceptional
To me it's causal dining, nothing more
Like a glorified pizza joint that does not sell by the slice
Also parking stinks, but that goes for pretty much any place in Park Slope
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats)
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce
The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come
Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16
warm atmosphere, mezmerizing wood fired oven,tasty pizza,good friendly service, smiling faces,have been a member since they opened in 03 they keep me coming back again again again
try the balsalmic chicken molto mario would be jealous
keep up the good work
I used to frequent this place at least once every 2 weeks - I will not anymore I ordered at 2pm - they told me it would be delivered in 25-30 minutes
I received it in 1 hour and 30 minutes, after calling
The pizza was cold to the touch
AND a 1
95 delivery charge! So you have to pay that along with tipping the driver
what's the poin? Also, they upped their prices, so I have their old menu, and was surprised when my bill came to over $5 more than it used to (I know, not a huge deal)
I called them and asked them how my bill came to that amount, which they told me, along with telling me the delivery fee
Then I told them that my pizza arrived late and COLD , and they said - I'm sorry about that ma'am
I'm sure they are
i dined here with my girlfriend and we sampled a few different types of pizza
the thin crust was only average but the others were fantastic
though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side
great eats, good times
This place has some great food! Yeah it's a little bright
but at least you can see it's very clean! The BRICK OVEN pizza is great
I've tried many different toppings
Also check out the Lasagna! Portions are huge and the bread they serve while waiting is very tasty
I keep going back and sending in my friends with or without me
Definately better in the restaurant than having it delivered (pizza is always better straight out of the oven)
The only bad thing is they charge $1
50 for delivery
This is a fun restaurant to go to
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere
But the pizza is way to expensive
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn
The pizza is overpriced and soggy
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
A big disappointment, all around
La Villa is one of the finest additions to Park Slope in years
A gourmet Italian pizzeria serving neapolitan pizzas and other pizzas, family sized pastas and salads at very reasonable prices
The modern restaurant has a clean friendly ambiance and the open pizza kitchen with roaring wood burning ovens add to the atmosphere
The Foccacia di Nonna is brilliant
The mozzerella is not quite difaras and is no doubt refrigerated due to health regs but still makes a superb pizza with an accompanying well charred crust with good oven spring
A small of any pizza is AMPLE for a dining couple, at average of 11-12 per small pie
We also tried roasted balsamic chicken dish that was excellent with diverse accompanying vegetables (tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, asparagus)
$14 and enough to feed a hungry trio
I heartily reccommend
La Villa restaurant has become a part of my favorite 'staple' restaurants in Park Slope
The food is simple, relatively solid italian fare, without hefty prices
Until recently, I was a huge fan of the bruschetta, eggplant involtini, and speciale pizza
But until recently, I had not had a negative experience at La Villa, and certainly not twice in a row
Last time, they were out of my favorite deep dish crust, which was awfully dissapointing
I had a significantly less tasty rendition of my favorite pizza

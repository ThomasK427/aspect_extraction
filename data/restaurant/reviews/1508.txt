The cheese sauce is made of powdered cheese (how you make 4 cheese mac and cheese with powder, I do not know)
Yes, the same stuff you would find in 75 cent box of mac and cheese at your local bodega
Using fake cheese in mac and cheese at a restaurant that is supposed to specialize in the dish is quite like opening up a juice bar and serving kool-aide
Ick!
Novelty idea falls short of my expectations
I don't think this place will be around very long
The idea of just mac and cheese gets old fast, even if they have a bunch of choices
I'd prefer the Kraft mac and cheese in the blue box
The mac is not good enough to be the focus of the restaurant
Place is beautiful and has great food
Excellent vine list and very well priced
Great selection of vines by quartino
awful start to finish
went on a nice thursday night and we were 1 of only 2 tables in the whole place
zero atmosphere, overpriced menu, average food
we ordered the bacon appetizer thinking it would be similar to Lugers or any other reputable steakhouse - WRONG
They brought out tiny pieces of Oscar Meyer breakfast bacon
Eastern European waitstaff doesn't get the customer service thing either
save your money, boycott these average spots and lets keep NY restaurants on top
Get there quick because by next week they will be selling all the fancy furniture and kitchen equipment on EBay! Where do I begin
They pour a fantastic glass of ice water and that's it! The bread on the table was harder than titanium
Maybe it wasn't supposed to be eaten just for decoration
The bacon appetizer doesn't even compare to Army MREs
I would say maybe on par with hospital food
The shrimp cocktail was just average until my waiter put his dirty sleeve in my plate
Thank you now its really tasty
I think the waitstaff was hired away from the KFC down the block
This place is history!!
Got caught at the last minute looking for a restaurant on the West Side to take important clients, and held my breath coming here for the first time
But what a great place! Understated but sleek decor, prompt/attentive/not overbearing service, stiff drinks from the bar, and awesome steaks
Will definitely return
I was at an event at the Garden and found Staghorn right near there so went with some friends for dinner
What a nice restaurant
The steak of course was great and the drinks were made nice and strong
Service was just as good
I would definitely suggest have dinner one night if you are in the area!!!
Come once in the Hudson Restaurant week force me to come again in this place
Well, I came because I saw their review and they on the restaurant week list
It's fantastic
The dish is so tasty, the sushi is so fresh
Of course I will come back even 15 minutes drive from my home
Only the think, I got confuse with their location; in the far away from the city, far from anywhere except from Hudson river, second floor, the stair look like the stair of Bronx apartment
I feel I found treasure sushi place
I actually kinda suprised to find this place
I mean,well
on the second floor but when my friends and I enter the restaurant, it was a really nice atmosphere and they have a really great collection of a fresh and live fish
Try their Yellowtail Serrano or SpicyTuna Tartar
It was unbelievable! The Noodles dish were great too!I haven't find any good noodles place in Jersey City until now and one more thing, you can bring your own boost too
how great is that?The service was great, the server were friendly and helpfull
I totally recommended this place, you won't regret it
And my friends and I actually have a reservation again tonight and I can't wait to try their new stuff
It's surprising place, even hidden on the second floor
Most they have great dishes, especially sashimi
Always have new dish everytime, it's good 'trick' to keep their regular customer
Anyway, did I said most of their dish is interesting dish ?, mixing fusion style, modern technique into Japanese food
Hopefully they get their liquor license, I am tire to bring my own liquor
I came last friday because I showed from jclist
It was excellent, nice sushi
My wife got tempura entree because she pregnant now and she love it very much
Actually she want to eat sushi, but their staff reject to serve it
Actually, the just added one more manager for weekday, both of them are great maintance their staff
Nice atmosphere
It is a little crazy busy during day time, so you had better to make reservation
Overall, two thumbs up !!
Fabulous, original food in a warm, unpretentious setting
Great wine list
This is a gem and something really unique in the neighborhood
A friend and I went to Graziellas on a Friday afternoon
The restaurant was about 1/3 full
We shared a cold antipasto-more than enough for 2 and very tasty
Along with the appetizer we were brought a basket of assorted breads that were crispy and fresh
On the table you will also find individual bottles of fine imported olive oil which we put on the bread-fantastic! I ordered a thin-crust individual meat pizza which was big enough for two and my companion ordered pasta with pesto
Both orders were generously portioned and scrumptious
We shared a bottle of very good chianti(about $20)
Service was very good and the atmosphere was convivial but not loud
I can't wait to return
I went to Devin with a bunch of friends from work last night, and we all left very happy
This was not an easy to please crowd either - typical, picky investment bankers
The food is amazing - especially the shrimp and grits and the lamb, which was what I had
Unreal
Being from the South originally, I was a little hesitant to try the grits, but they were perfect
The lamb was, too
My friend had the filet, and I tried it - wow
Perfect crust on the outside
Next time I go back, I'm definitely getting it
And try the special cocktails if you check the place out - I had a basil-infused caparinia, which sounds weird, but it was awesome
One of my friends had their special old fashioned, and that was excellent, too
The decor is cool, too - brick archways, cool furniture, good lighting, great ambiance, good looking staff, etc
I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back
Really some of the best food I've had in New York, which is a high threshold to cross as anyone who lives here knows
I've been going to Dylan Prime for a while
I was really excited when I found out Devin was open
We went there last weekend and everything was top notch
I was surprised, delighted
and disappointed that they didn't duplicate anything from Dylan
(love the green beans and lobster salad from Dylan)
They had some fresh twist on cocktails
The basil pepper mojito was a little daunting in concept, but I was refreshed at the flavor
the pepper bits were a bit odd at first, but I liked it enough to have a second
My girlfriend had the muddled old fashion per the bartender's recommendation and loved it

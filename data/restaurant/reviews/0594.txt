We found the service quite good and attentive, the meals did take a while to come after the appetizer, but we weren't exactly in a hurry, and afterwards the waiter went out of his way to apologize for the delay
Food, delicious, we'll definitely go back
Waiting in the bar downstairs, they don't serve the flavored margaritas the restaurant does upstairs
This was quite possibly the worst meal I have ever been served at a restaurant
The enchiladas were tasteless and DRENCHED in grease
The service was average, but the waitress looked at my full plate, and didn't ask me if I was satisfied (i
e
why I had only taken two bites of my entree)
Decor was lovely, but I can't eat the table
Margarita was wonderful
I'll never return
Bland food and bad service
Meals not served at once and service was inattentive and forgetful
Fajitas tasted like microwaved tyson chicken strips with a corn tortilla thrown on top of it
Not worth the trip
The food was fantastic and the prices were reasonable
Very fresh and flavorful
For example, the duck (probably purchased from the live poultry market across the street on Degraw) was seasoned and cooked to perfection
The cerviche was robust and substantial in portion
The flan may be better described as vanilla pudding but it too was phenomenal
Note though that the views of the bridge are hard to come by on the main dining level so come for the food not the views
This place is a gem and a definate addition to my rolodex of where to entertain
The atmosphere at Alma is wonderful - beautiful space with fantastic views of lower Manhattan
In the summer, the roof deck is great
The food is good, if not stellar, and fairly authentic
The mole is not as deep and rich as an authentic mole
I've had varying experiences with the chips and salsa
Sometimes, quite good, sometimes a bit stale
There's nothing authentic about chips and salsa, of course, so they might neglect it
The tamales are surpisingly good
Often, tamales in the U
S
are much too thick
Alma seems to have worked out the corn to filling ratio
On one night, the filling was an exceptional stewed chicken
The drinks are mixed well, not to sweet
The food is served family style
The tortillas are fairly good, the beans a bit soupy
Overall, Alma is a good choice for a fun evening with great drinks and good food
Ignore the map, if it is still showing Alma located on a little sliver of a waterside strip
It is wrong
Alma is not in Red Hook and is maybe a mile or 2 north of where it is mapped, still on Columbia Street
For the view and the food, it is worth the trek over here
The service was not the greatest the night I was there--it seemed as if the 2 waitstaff members were googly-eyed and newly in love, and therefore we did not exist, but aside from that, it is a great, cozy, appealing place
I'm not sure if the earlier reviews were from when the restaurant just opened (thus, the crowds)
I just moved to this neighborhood, and Alma has quickly become my boyfriend's and my new favorite place
True, the view is fantastic, but in my experience, the food is so good, you'll be more enthralled by what's on your plate
Oh, and we've been seated promptly every time, so I'd give Alma a fighting chance
The food here is great and best of all, it's not ridiculously overpriced like so many other places back on Court or Smith St
I've been here twice, and both times it's been fabulous
Yes, on weekend nights be prepared to wait about an hour for a table, but with the great bar downstairs, it's not a big deal
The view, the view
fight your way to a snotty waiter to get a table
Is the food worth it? I don't know
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left
WHy am I getting glared at from the workers- I didn't create this narrow bottleneck that only creates patron's hostility! Make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?
Fortunately there is a nice bar with good ambience, otherwise the hour-long wait to eat would have been unbearable
Unfortunately, the food didn't help make up for the time spent waiting
First of all, the building is fantastic - that rarest of things, quality new construction
That said, the restaurant is at the top of a long, long STEEP set of stairs
Don't bring anone elderly
Then the room is narrow and long; set up so the only place to wait for a table is at the crux of the kitchen, bathroom, and entrance
The food is only mediocre
The service confused
Strangest of all, the windows on their much touted view have many small panes - why?
Although the terrace is in fact really nice, the food is fair to middling
In addition, the waitstaff was clueless
The atmosphere on the roof -- and the view -- are unbeatable
The food is very good - gourmet mexican, I would say
The drinks are fantastic, and the staff are so polite and friendly
I almost hesitate to post a good review because I don't want too many people going there! I feel like it's a secret gem
But the secret is already out
The view is spectacular
The margaritas are great
The chips and salsa are tasty
I think they just tried to get a little too creative with the menu and actually ended up losing flavor in some of the dishes
I would go back just to drink margaritas on the roof with some chips and salsa during sundown, but pass on the dinner
The Scene With no windows and only a tiny sign, Apizz has a discreet presence on Eldridge Street
Inside, though, it is charmingly decorated, with dimly lit brick and a giant wood-fired oven occupying center stage
The clientele is young and hip, but serious about its food
The Food The focus of the restaurant is the eponymous pizzas, each with a flaky, salty crust only a few millimeters thick
One is topped with crumbled sausage and the deeply savory house tomato sauce; another, with spinach and three kinds of cheese, absorbs that smoky flavor beautifully
The very hot brick oven also gives a smoky richness to dishes like tender mussels in white wine broth, and creamy lasagna with asparagus, zucchini and cherry tomatoes
A whole fish roasted and served on a bed of rosemary has a wonderful crisp exterior and moist, delicate flesh
Food is amazing
Service is great
Ambience is Perfect
A little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for
Call ahead as the space is small
Highly Recommended
Cuta and cosy
Tried a few appetizers and main dishes and to be honest
each one was awesome
there were no dissapointments
will def go back
Went with 4 other people, that was a little tight, so I would not reccommend going with a large group
The place is cute and cozy and has a nice lounge downstairs if your just in the mood for cocktails
Nice wine list
The montepulciano is cheapest wine served by the galss at $7 and is great
I had the Ravioli di Zucca and it was SO SO good

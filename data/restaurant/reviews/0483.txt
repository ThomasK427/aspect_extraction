This is a very unique place in New Jersey
SHHHHH, don't tell anybody
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel
Service is not very professional but who cares if you can sit in the beautiful garden and sample the delicious escobar with a peach beurre blanc or the incredible Canard a l'orange, a thinly sliced magret with a rich and sweet orange/sesame sauce over a perfectly cooked ginger, mustard rice
Went to Marco last night with my husband for Valentines Day and had a really miserable experience
They told us the wait would be 20 mins-an hour later they finally seated us (no apologies) literally crammed into a drafty corner
Our order was taken 20 minutes later we were told we could not have the what we wanted because the kitchen was closing and the staff needed to go home! havent u heard of a last order call?  I have been here a bunch of times in the day but on a busy night like this they were a mess
The food is great-portions pretty small
But for the prices they are charging you expect top-notch service
Sorry MP
you really let us down
There are a ton of newer places in the neighborhood I would prefer to go to anyday
Looking for a great place for good food, good wine and great music, Marco Pepe is the plcae
The atmospher is relaxing and inviting, the wine and beer list is extensive and the service is excellent
A great place to eat or just hang out at the bar
Kudos to the chef
Marco Pepe is one of my favorite places, whether alone or with a group the service and food get ***** stars
Marco and Pepe has become one of my favorite restaurants
The ambience is casual and relaxing
The menu offers so much variety; you'll want to eat there more than once to try everything
Each dish has its own identity and offers a fistful of flavor
The wine/beer list is superb offering an ecclectic assortment to choose from
The staff is personable and friendly providing you with an unforgettable dining experience
Desserts are excellent
For chocolate lovers like myself I would definately reccomend the Warm Chocolate cake drizzled with raspberry reduction and served with a scoop of hazlenut gelato
It will definately hit the spot
If you happen to be in Jersey City I urge you to visit Marco and Pepe
Who knows it might become your favorite restaurant and I might even be there
I have been a regular customer at MP since they opened, and I have to say that they are better then ever
They have really expanded their range of food and service, it is fantastic
From their wide range of beers and wines, to their menu which is now accessible to all because they offer portions and full size entrees
There are many more choices, including a small bar menu which is great for a quick snack and drink after work
The staff is larger now, very professional and personal, which is probably one of the reasons for all the great changes and the amazing food
This place is truly the gem of Jersey City, and I am not the only one who has noticed this latley
It is a beatiful little resaurant with wonderful ambience
I'd bought bread there several late nights on the way home, and looked forward to the Guinea Fowl and Majorcan wine on the list
When I stopped by last Friday for a burger, though, it was really really bad--The burgers (both mine and my friend's) arrived cold
When we alerted the waitress to this, she took them to the kitchen, then returned the same burgers later (by now overcooked with dry bun but somehow still cold) asking who had more fries
and a cold bite from a hard burger with wooden grease fries was what we got
This is quite simply one of the best new establishments to come to Jersey City hands down
The friendly and welcoming atmosphere combined with great food, excellent coffee, and a great wine selection makes this a can't miss
The croissant French toast is delicious and the grilled sandwiches accompanied with fresh greens make the slightly above average prices well worth it
Great place to bring your folks on a weekend or grab a drink after work with your friends
Satay in Hoboken is addictive -- I used to go for lunches and dinners there, and order takeouts
The prices are very reasonable, and the restaurant is so close to Manhattan (approx
2 blocks from the PATH station)
My favorites there are Chicken Pineapple on Coconut Rice (served in a pineapple shell) and Shrimp Mango on Coconut Rice
Curry dishes and appetizers are great, too
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money
Try the ribs, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice
Great desserts of peanute pancake, moochi (you can get all 4 different flavors if you ask) or the pan fried ice cream
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good
The atmosphere is attractive, but a little uncomfortable
The staff is very friendly
This restaurant is one of those concealed gems of North Jersey
It provides excellent fresh Italian entrees and salads, and an interesting Pasta Fagioli
Tortellini Carbonara was a real surprise and an excellent entree
Wine is BYOB
Get there early if you don't want to stand in line, there are only about a dozen tables
Take-away is also available
Run, don't walk, to this neat little place!
The service is excellent, with very friendly family people
However, the pizza was nothing special
It was so flimsy that when you picked up the slice, it would flop over
Too much sauce and a powdery floury crust
There is definitely better pizza in Lodi than Curioni's
Curioni's Pizza has been around since the 1920's
They make the best pizza in New Jersey
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip
it's hard to get to if you aren't used to the area, lots of one way streets, but with the new parking lot it's easy to find a spot
The food - unbelievable
The baby clam steamers are the size of a penny in a wonderful broth with homemade wonderful brown bread
The barbeque is to die for, whether you want chicken or ribs, with rice or fries
You can't beat Algarve, for take out or a sit down dinner
I was out of the country for two years and this was the only place I wanted to go on my way home from Newark Airport
Ask for Paul, he's the best waiter ever!
In Short With 30-plus outposts up and down the Eastern seaboard, this Cambridge-based chain reels in a seemingly endless supply of after-work professionals and tired tourists
The look varies somewhat from establishment to establishment but a casually nautical theme and a crowd as loud as the ocean's roar are fairly consistent
Signature dishes include clam chowder, wood-grilled swordfish, steamed clams, and 2-pound lobsters that can be ordered baked and stuffed with scallops and shrimp
Went here with a party of 10 for Easter lunch and had a fabulous time
I can't fathom what the reviewer below is talking about
My family ordered Chardonnay wine, calamari, lobster, Alaskan crab legs, stuffed shrimp, wild salmon and halibut and everything was extremely fresh and delicious
It was well worth the price
They also have a private room that can accomodate parties of 30 and that would be a nice location for a birthday or special family gathering
I liked the fact that the music wasn't blaring and that you could actually have a conversation
Service was good and we never felt rushed
I also loved the nautical theme seen throughout the restaurant
This is a nice place --- enjoy
I certainly plan to
One suggestion -- make reservations
This is one of the higher quality chain restaurants I've been to
I went here with my husband expecting great seafood and was totally disappointed
We shared the Clam Chowder that tasted exactly like canned soup
I order the Almond Encrusted Salmon and the the crust was stale and the entire dish had no flavor
My husband had the Fisherman's Platter and that wasn't anything special either
The only thing that was tasty there was the Bananas Foster but we didn't go there for the dessert
You could get better food at any local crab shack for much cheaper

And the margaritas and tequila selection aren't bad, either
Thanks, Paquito's
Mexican food in New York is generally barely edible
Paquito's tacos are like authentic Mexican ones - only better, 'cause they're stuffed in guacamole and other good stuff
(Tacos, by the way, are made from soft corn tortillas
)
I had searched for a very long time for good AND authentic Mexican food in this city
Very, very hard to find
This is it
Tacos just as good as those from the streets of Mexico City, which is a GREAT compliment
I had the kielbasa sandwich and sipped a few different drinks, including a Cosmo and the Baba Yaga
Everything was delicious
Quite nice
My mom took me to the old Kiev to introduce me to potato pierogies and fruit compote
I fell in love
We were crestfallen when we heard it was closed
When it reopened under new management, I dragged my friends there, desperate to once again enjoy those awesome pierogies
They were still good, but the service was awful, the pierogies came in wierd little bamboo containers, and they'd done away with those delicious fruit compotes
I'd shun the place if I could, but I love those pierogies so damn much
I remember the old kiev
It's changed
It's all snazzy looking and the portions per buck are pretty small
They still have great food and even better service
Always try the stuffed cabbage and borscht
Blintzes are also great
After a time away from NYC, I decided to visit one of my favorite restaurants last night for potato pancakes, perogies, blintz and all the tasty treats KIEV USED TO OFFER
FYI, Kiev has been RUINED
The charming diner-like atmosphere has vanished and has been replaced with a cold, wanna-be meatpacking restaurant with HORRID service and TERRIBLE food
Our server ignored us and when our order came out wrong, instead of addressing the issue, he recruited kitchen staff to wipe off the wrong ingredients and try to reserve us the same dish
If you want raw potato pancakes and a nasty attitude, give Kiev a try
I hope your new doors close as soon as they opened
Anyone have a new Eastern European place to try?
Last winter
Kiev was one of the best stops for a late night run for some delicious (the best I've had) chicken soup and a toasted bagel
Fast fwd to this winter: Soup has now become some hybrid pickeled chicken ball with who know's what in it-- soup
and no more bagels =/ We didn't even know if it was chicken soup since it tasted so horrid
but the Server informed us that they wanted to make the soup their own and that she hopes we like it
I just grinned and beared it and scarfed down the free bread and fries we ordered
WHY KIEV WHY! You had such a good thing going
The soup was so good and hearty
Who wants a pickled chicken soup!? YUCK!  I know you want to add more flair to your menu and restaraunt
but you are just making it suck
At least the bread is good
This is my favorite of the Ukranian/Polish places in the east village
Pierogis have a good ratio of filling to shell
Small plates allow you to mix and match
Ambiance is good: a little nicer than a diner, but more casual than a lounge
Don't miss the apple-champagne cocktail, which tastes like a milder bubbly apple martini - only $3
50 during happy hour
Live music on Tuesday nights
Staff is good looking
Kiev used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Manhattan
Great hearty Eastern European food, low prices and a diner-like atmosphere
After being away from the city for several years I was horribly disppointed to see what they've become
The place is now a wannabe-upscale Eastern European/Asian fusion restaurant
Serving things like Chicken Kiev with a garlic mashed potato egg roll for $$ with the snooty attitude to match! Gimme a break!!!   Avoid this place like the plague!
Whenever I get a craving for some Slavic eats, I head over to the Kiev
The potato pancakes, buckwheat pancakes with smoked salmon, the wonderous variety of pierogies all make this one of my favorite cheap dining options in the city
When I go with friends we like to order a variety of plates and share everything
Be sure to try the sweet potato and spinach pierogies, the best pierogie I've ever had
We get a kick out of the faux artisan faucet in the restroom sink too
I'm loathe to give a positive review, simply because I don't want a lot of people to ruin my favorite restaurant in the city
Kiev is fantastic- open 24 hours, dirt cheap, and delicious
The only MINOR drawback is the service is sometimes slow, especially for groups
But the waiters are always willing to accomodate requests, and large groups are welcome
GREAT date place
4 pierogies for $4
50, 8 for $7
Kielbasa, 4 pierogies, sauerkraut, and stuffed cabage for $9
The free bread alone is worth the trip- sweet, delicious, and plentiful
Not all Ukrainian food- sandwiches, burgers, breakfast, etc
great food, and talk about pierogies (if you have to ask you haven't had one)
fried, boiled and pan fried
what more do i have to say
even pleased my parents
I can't believe that someone dined here as recently as end of March of this year and had good things to say
The service is AWFUL
It seemed like the waitpersons had a conference as to who would deal with us
Every other item on the menu wasn't available! A couple at another table was treated just as shabbily
They had no syrup for the pancakes! What type of place does this? I know my group will never go back and I doubt that other couple will either
Do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this place! 2nd Avenue has much better choices to offer than this dive!
I had the fried potato Pierogi, and they were delicious
I also had a blueberry Blintz, and that was good too
the filling especially
Good pierogi and kasha varnishkes
Lousy Decor, but very inexpensive prices
We just stopped here randomly and were very impressed
We both had perogies that turned out to be delicious, and the price was pretty good, but I guess this is the lower east side anyway
Service was nothing special
And the location is good too if you're taking a little walking tour down there
Kiev: they do some things
This restaurant makes the greatest and tastiest Eastern-European food in New York City
Furthermore, they are open 24-7, what more could you ask
Amazingly, the prices are cost-effective
As a Jewish-male from Michigan, I can relate to many of the dishes served
Although they make a ladkah like nobodys business, the Polish folk call the dish potato pancake,(semantics if you as me)
Ironically enough, it seems most of what I know as Jewish-food, turns out to be Eastern-European, (go figure)
Just bring it, Kiev is sexy as heck!
I used to eat at this restaraunt all the time but all that changed when they got new management
The food used to be tasty, well cooked, and cheap

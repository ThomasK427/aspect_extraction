As a venezuelan is a shame that this restaurant pretend to represent the food from my country
This restaurant simply humiliates its patrons
They will make you sorry you came, will throw food on the table, will not allow you to stay for a while, will not offer you dessert and will charge you 20% service charge even though the menu say 18% only
Please guys - dont go there - enough with treating New Yorkers like suckers
We deserve more!
We read a review of the new location of Flor's Kitchen and it said something like, Arepas, arepas, arepas and we should have stuck with these words of wisdom
The arepas were indeed delicious - try the shredded beef and the black bean and plantain for sure
However everything else on the menu was mediocre at best
The grilled steak was HORRIBLE - essentially a piece of fat on a plate
The fish also left something to be desired
I would recommend Flor's to a friend but with a caveat - stick with the arepas
Get a bunch for the table and enjoy
The salad and entrees were not worth the money
The Scene  Clinton Street was woefully sushi-deprived until this mod, chartreuse storefront came along
The brightly backlit four-stool counter, manned by some of the cities trendiest sushi cooks, is perpetually packed
Diners sans reservations squeeze into the narrow dining room's steel chairs and banquettes
Service is almost too attentive for the casual scene
The Food  The cheap-chic menu is a notch above most neighborhood sushi joints
There are the usual suspects--sinus-clearing wasabi shumai, big bowls of chewy soba in fragrant fish stock--as well as surprising starters, which range from simply great, thimble-sized molds of steamed spinach with peanut-sesame sauce to simply fun fried shrimp cocktail with melon balls in a sundae glass
The $20 sushi and sashimi combos are a steal and arrive with thoughtful touches, such as lime slivers tucked beside mackerel to cut its inherent fishiness
Whimsical rolls, like the spicy tuna "Bahama Mama" with avocado and crunchy peppers, are satisfying but small
Although very small and sometimes hard to get a reservation for, it is well worth the effort as the sushi is excellent with great variety and it's BYOB - so you won't break your wallet
Have been here numerous times and will keep going back
bad service
decent sushi
do not go with a large group (even if you have a reservation they made us wait for over an hour)
On a mission to scope out the better sushi places in NYC, we came across Cube 63 and absolutely loved it! Due to the limited seating, the restaurant was very crowded but we were lucky to find a place at the sushi bar
Sushi was well prepared and the presentation was great
A bit off the beaten path, but a great place if you are looking for BYOB and tasty sushi!
The food is indeed quite good
However, the music was too loud, and the space cramped
The price is decent, although you don't get a lot for the omakase
The BYOB indeed helps with the bill at the end of the night
I love this place
I love the sushi
The Chefs are great
It's BYOB! You can't argue for more
I once lived above this place and ate there at least once a week
I always sit at the bar and the chefs would sometimes create certain dishes, rolls, or sushi that isn't on the menu
The fish is quite fresh and the ambiance is nice, although the place is a little small
I heard they just opened another place in Brooklyn though that's bigger
I would highly recommend this place although reservations are a must
This is my favorite restaurant to take people to in the city
Perfect to go with one friend, a bottle of wine and saki and saddle up to the bar
The sushi chefs Ben, Ken, and Wing are so much fun
I can't understand a word they are saying but they make the best Volcano Roll I have ever had
Its put in the toaster and literally melts in your mouth
Its BYOB, bring a big bottle of something and share it with the guys, they appreciate it and they will remember you when you come back
All my out of town friends that I have taken are obsessed and won't stop harassing me about how nothing they have had since even compares to that Volcano Roll
Get reservations b/c the place is tiny and the bar only seats 4 people
I went here last month with a few friends and had a great experience
It's BYOB which is nice
The place is TINY and reservations are key
Good place to stop at before hitting the bars in the LES
I highly recommend the Volcano Roll, it's probably the best tasting sushi I've ever had!!
This place is great
Nice staff
Great, fresh food
Good prices
Liquor store down the block
What more could you ask for? Decor is a bit bland - but that might be the point
I have been to Cube 63 on several occasions and have never been disappointed
The sushi is always fresh and without a doubt the best in the city
The Volcano Roll is to die for! You get such a bang for your buck here
Sushi for two won't cost you more than $70, and you will be stuffed by the end of your meal
The music and ambience are great
I will return in the very near future
I love this place! I am a newbie to the whole Sushi scene
I am the wimpy 'cooked only' type of gal, however, I have broaden my horizons thanks to this place
The Volcano Roll is wonderful as well as my favorit The Pink Lady
I am always nervous recomending places to my hard to please foodie friends but everytimg I take someone new to this place they RAVE! It can be a little loud, decor is majorly lacking and chairs are metal and freezing during the winter, but who cares? The food is what brings me back not the scuffed up white walls!
My dining companion and I brought a bottle of wine and they immediately opened it for us
All of the specialty rolls sounded heavenly but we went for the Clinton roll
It was delicious but it was nothing compared to the spicy tuna roll (which cost half as much!)
Next time (and there definitely will be many more next times), we will get the volcano roll
We also had the eel and avocado and the yellowtail/green onion
Both were very good
If you go here, sit at the bar
The two brothers that make the sushi are hilarious, and get drunker and drunker as the evening wears on
If you BYO, make sure you share
The food is merely good, but the experience makes Cube 63 worth the visit
new york's hippest sushi joint
by far
amazing food coupled with the most fun sushi chef's - brothers ken ben - you'll ever meet (and drink with)
go now
amazing, tasty, byo, great value
Just some words to describe my numerous visits to cube 63
The owners, and chefs, Ben and Ken are not only masterful chefs but entertainers in their own right, making you feel as if they were cooking for you in their own home
Make a visit and judge for yourself!
What a find!I'm originally from the area and boy has it changed
Clinton Street is restaurant row now with many new comers
My husband and I love sushi and decided to give this place a try
Boy did we love it! Although we did not have a reservation for Fri, we sat at the sushi bar and truly had a wonderful experience! Chefs are great! Very funny
Sushi is very well presented and very fresh! We will definitely be back with a bottle in tow next time!
I found Cube 63 on City Search, and I'm so glad I decided to check this place out
This restaurant has everything: cool, relaxed atmosphere, extremely nice and knowledgable waitstaff, and some of the best sushi I've ever tasted! The food presentation here is amazing
I took two friends who were visiting from out of town to dinner here, and the three of us were delighted with our experience
I just made reservations for Friday night!
I've been here a handful of times as a couple or with a group and it absolutely shines each time
The mood is cool and relaxed

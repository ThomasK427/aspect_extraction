My one recommendation is try not to geta seat by the door, there is a large brass bell that people like to whale on when they leave the place
It's a little unnerving when you're trying to enjoy your food and your eardrumbs are shalacked by repeated
ear-piercing rings
This place has amazingly flavorful vegetarian Indian food - Ive been going there for years and have brought many a friend there who was happy to have been introduced to such a great place! i don't understand these bad reviews - it IS NOT a curry house, so one shouldn't expect that style of Indian food
And yes, the decor is charmingly theme-ish, as it re-creates an Indian courtyard, but in no way is the quality of the food touristy
As a New Yorker, I do not dine in Little Italy and Times square for that reason, and this restaurant DOES NOT fall into that category
It's pretty quiet (rare for NYC), the service has always been consistently attentive, and it's a great deal for the price!
Service was very polite with the exception of the lady who first greeted us
Decor is quite pleasant, the entire area including the restroom was kept very clean
However, food is average to slightly above average at best, a lot of it is not really Gujarati in origin but rather Punjabi
I wasn't very impressed by the vast majority of the dishes
The samosas were of the tiny variety that you can buy frozen
The only items that stood out in my mind are the khichdi, khadi and the chai
The menu largely consists of simple indian dishes cooked in a home-style manner
This isn't inherently problematic but I'm afraid the execution in this instance does not live up to billing
Lastly, don't be fooled by the price-fix quote, they charge an arm and a leg for drinks
The ambiance completely transports you and allows for intimate conversation
The food is fantastic
The the price fix relieves you of choices, just allowing you to sit back and be served- West Indian style
Had heard a lot about this place
But, got a chance to visit only yesterday and I am glad I made time to visit the place
The ambience is awesome and even though the restaurant might be fully booked, it doesn't look crowded
Best Vegetarian Gujarati food I ever had
Gajar ka halua was the Best
Me and my wife went to this place with our close friends
This place is truly one of the best places to find a authentic vegetarian gujrati food
The ambience is awesome and the well/banyan tree, kites etc etc take you back to that indian village life
Service was also really professional
Was an amazing place to end 2005 at
I've been to Vatan several times and it is both good for couples and groups
The restaurant is decorated very uniquely and the unlimited food is very tasty and satisfying
The staff is attentive and will bring you back as much food as you specify
I'd recommend making reservations because it is a popular restaurant
Worst service that I have ever seen
Waitress was very rude
Would not even ask if we wanted more appetizers, just took the plates away
Too slow to bring food
Would never go there again and won't recommend to anyone either
I've been to Vatan's several times and have never had the problems some reviewers complain about
My reservations have always been honored (I've even been a bit late for a couple), the staff has been very attentive (explaining each item and explaining that we're more then welcome to ask for more at any time)
I would higly recommend them to anyone
I spent an evening at Vatan tonight with my partner, and we had a wonderful experience
I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price
I found that the food variety was great, and the waitress was very accommodating to my vegan boyfriend describing all items' ingredients and how you may request more of what YOU like, creating a unique experience
I am wary of other reviews saying they were rude or they wanted us out, because you usually deal with your waitress alone; not an army of Hindi apathetics
Best chai tea, and overall, worth every bite!
It says All You Can Eat, but as soon as you tell the waitress that you've never been there, they just bring the pre-made things that are cold and don't even explain it to you that you can keep ordering what you want
Also, they chase you out by pushing you to pay
They don't want people to sit and relax
In fact, we were asked to give up our table when more than half of the tables were empty!! The place was so empty at 8:30 pm, still we had to leave
The women who work there seem so grumpy, too
To make the matter worse, the food was not good
Ignore Zagat!!
Took 2 guests for dinner
Advertised as 22
95 for fixed price dinner
We did'nt order any drinks
Got a bill of $90
00 with nothing itemized
I was with 2 guests and could not inquire about the bill so had to just pay it
Nice way to steal

I love this restaurant
My brother came in from out of town and I brought him there and even though neither one of us were vegetarians we left totally stuff and fulfilled
The food is just delicious and the staff is so accomadating and polite
I would recommend this place as a great introduction to someone who has never tried indian food as they give you tiny appetizer like portions of a myriad of items(that they keep bringing you more of), so if you aren't crazy about an item it's not a big deal b/c there are a ton of other dishes to try
Just make sure you make a reservation
Take your shoes off, sit on a pillow, and tell them how spicy you like it
and they do the rest! The interior is a bit kitschy but it adds to the charm
It's a great open space where you aren't cramped or rushed
Just make sure you make reservations a few days in advance because there aren't a lot of tables
Be prepared to loosen your belt a few notches too because it's all you can eat and you just can't stop eating!
ITs all you can eat, and the non-Indian people will love the atmosphere of being in a village
As for the food its okay Gujarati-Vegetarian food, with plenty of refils
At about $23 bucks a pop, don't think its worth it
I rather spend that much, order from a menu and get great food
This is an exceptional restaurant
The service is great
Everyone is extremely polite and helpful
The decor is meant to give you the impression that you are in an Indian village and its very well done
The restaurant is quiet
The food is very good and you get a lot of food
Very good value
One of my favorite restaurants in NYC
I am surprised to read negative reviews about this place, but then again restaurants are not very consistent
Anyways, I love the food here, and although it is Gujarati, it is not sweet, which makes it a real treat! This is my favorite restaurant, and satisfies my vegetarian tastes
I would recommend it to any Indian! A variety ensures that one will never go hungry in case one doesn't like certain dishes
The tea is very close to the Indian taste, which is rare in the US
This is one of those places that is great for the vegetarian and non vegetarian alike
The deep fried peppers (not sure of the proper name?) were phenomenal and must have been in response to requests for spicier food
A great place to sit around in a non hurried atmosphere and kick back a lot of Indian beer
I had dinner here with some friends from out of town and at first we were shocked at the tiny portions


But they kept coming and they were soooo good! I would highly recommend Vatan
The decor was fun and I love any excuse to eat with my hands
I love this place!! Everytime someone visits me from out of town, I take them to Vatan
We always eat so much we feel uncomfortable, but we have a great time every time
I've never had a bad experience there, always had very attentive service (the ladies explain each item, how it is to be eaten and even ask if you would like it spicier next time) and the ambience is excellent
Be sure you sit at the tables where you sit cross-legged with your shoes off!

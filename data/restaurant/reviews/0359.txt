and i have been to the purported best in nyc, and I don't understand what the other reviewers are saying! the service was very good, although i was anticipating the worst based on the reviews i had read
i came here twice so far just to see whether the second time around is as amazing as the first-- and it was!! I love this place, and would come here any day of the week
the dinner, however, was not cheap, and came to about $180 per head
be prepared to pay-- you must get the $85 omakase tasting menu! i love this place!
JUST WHEN YOU IMAGINE THAT JEWEL BAKO CANNOT POSSIBLY IMPROVE UPON PERFECTION - THEY RENOVATE THE SPACE AND MAKE IT MORE BEAUTIFUL
The food, as always, is absurdly fantastic (not enough superlatives) and our favorite host/owner as gracious as ever
30/30/30!
First off, my table was waiting for me at my appointed reservation time
The setting/ambiance is great for a date, thus that's what alot of the tables are composed of
As for the food, I thought it was good, not extraordinary
I've had better sushi elsewhere, and more inventive cooked food as well
The portions are small, but you can be relatively filled up by the end of your meal
The upside of the smallish portions is that a good sake can do a better job working over one's date, and you don't leave the table w/ a food coma
Yes, the prices are high, but I'm getting used to it here in Manhattan for venues such as this, especially the nouveau Japanese ones
All in all an impressive and hopefully effective place to take a date, but I don't feel compelled to go back for any other reason
If you love sushi, you'll love this place
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth
Immaculate service, charming and cozy atmosphere, you can't go wrong here
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet
It is rare that a true new york sushi enthusiast can be truly wowed by sushi
AND be wowed again and again, as we cannot get enough of jewel bako's amazing food
The toro, the uni, the yellotail, the sake, the adorable and interesting sushi chef-masa, and of course Jack! Go to Jewel Bako and you will agree that it is the best in nyc
Don't even bother with the others
without a doubt, this was the freshest sushi I have ever eaten
The flavor and consistency of the fish was incomparable to anything I have ever had (I eat sushi frequently!)
Service was lovely, and the decor was pretty and intimate, without being claustrophic and noisy
The sake list was impressive, and the sake that we finally did order was delicious
This is an expensive restaurant - make no mistake - but well worth the cost
The service is horrible
The food is no better than Haru and their inability to honor a reservation is unacceptable
Save your money, go to any of the better restaurants in the area
The next time I am in that area, I'll do Indian
A good friend and I were out to lunch and the topic of Jewel Bakos reviews here came up
We decided either Nobu or Bond Street wrote the negative ones to detract business away from the superior Jewel Bako! I have been there a number of times and received nothing but stellar service
Jack is a wonderful comic relief and the waitresses are highly professional and efficient
I have never had to wait, but I would gladly
If you go, order the omakase
It is the only way to experience the full spectrum of what they have to offer
The sashimi is succulent, supple and nothing short of sublime
With the omakase you get a very generous plate full
The portion size of sashimi is comparable to that of any of the competition
It is expensive, yes
But it is an exquisite dining experience!
When I say this was the best sushi I've ever had, I mean I can never eat sushi anywhere else
The texture and flavor was indescribable
It was like I'd never eaten sushi before
There's only ten tables and it's shaped like the interior of a jewelry box, hence the name
I had the tasting menu which was about 10 pieces of sashimi and 10 pieces of sushi, plus yellowfin soup, many assorted sushi-type appetizers and a sake-steamed mushroom dish
It was sublime - just totally amazing
I left there feeling very full, but at the same time so contented and happy
Although a little pricey, it was worth every penny
If I ever top that, I'll be in heaven, literally
Okay, its a beautiful place, but the food was just dressed up with no real substance
Very expensive, and I felt like tweezers would have been better than a fork in regard to portions
The people couldnt have been nicer and more accomodating, but I wanted to be impressed- I wasnt
I agree with many of the other reviewers in that the sushi portions are just too small for the value
If the quality made up for it, that would be another thing, but it was only average
There are so many other sushi places in New York that offer better sushi for a better price
Jewel Bako is the best sushi experience in Manhattan, bar none
The quality and freshness of the sushi is unmatched
Do not go expecting california rolls, because you will be disappointed
This sushi eating for the purist
The chef's presentation is remarkable as is his choice of fish
The experience is topped off by remarkable service and warm brought by the staff who makes you feel like you are the only customer in the packed restaurant
If you like to eat at the top restaurants in NYC you should add Jewel Bako to your list
The portions were laughably small
I ordered the Tuna Tartare and it was a 2 in
diameter by 1 in
high mound of tuna
For $15 I was expecting a little more
The sushi was extremely small as well
Needless to say, I left hungry, and went to McDonald's around the corner, while my friends got pizza
I was at Nobu the night before, and by far, had a very pleasant experience there
I agree with the reviewer below me: mediocre sushi
The architecture is attractive, but the J
Bako hype is for the anorexic dilettants who frequent the place to be seen and not to eat the (mediocre) sushi
The service tries very hard (too hard, actually: it's almost sycophantish)
I didn't find it rude, more stifling
If you're into going somewhere for the hip scene, this is your place
If you're in it more for the good sushi and pleasant eating conditions, NYC's got a lot of good sushi restaurants
Elsewhere
[BTW to the citysearch reviewer: horse makerel ain't so offbeat
]
Jewel Bako combines over-rated food with abominable service
Our waiter, who was also the owner, was condescending, dissmisive and completely inflexible when it came to ordering/preparation of our food
It was the single worst dining experience we have had in New York
If you want good sushi and polite service, definitely skip Jewel Bako and head to Nobu
The owner should be embarassed by the way he treats his customers
Jewel Bako serves the best sushi I've ever had, anywhere
I used to live in Japan, and have had some pretty good raw fish, but I was blown away by the Chef's tasting plate, which includes 6 appetizers including a stunning octopus portion and some incredible sashimi
It's expensive but worth it for a special occasion
The host/owner keeps the show going and seemed to know his fish
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEFINATELY NOT INCLUDED WITH YOUR MEAL
Overall I would highly recommend NOT going to this resturant
Unless you would prefer to wait an hour to be seated at a table even with reservations and screamed at by the pompous owner who will offer you a table that could not possibly accommodate a party of 3
There are plenty of excellent japanese resturants in NYC, don't waste your time or money at Jewel Bako
I must say that of all of the sushi restaurant I've been to in the city, Jewel Bako is definitely on the top of my list
(Bond street is close second)
JB not only has the best sushi, it also has various inventive dishes that makes the restaurant so special
The staff and owner is so friendly, and you can tell that they are proud of the food that they serve

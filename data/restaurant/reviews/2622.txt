Risotto is one of my favorite dishes and I have had it many times
However, when I had it at Trattoria Dopo Teatro, it was very undercooked - it was actually crunchy! When I said this to the waiter, he just said that's the way it's supposed to be and refused to take it back to the kitchen
I could not eat the dish so I just shared my friend's pasta dish (which was fine)
I was just shocked that a waiter would disagree with me when he hadn't even tasted the dish
Because of this negative experience, I will never return
I come here all the time
The food is fantastic, and the wait staff is incredibly friendly
A waiter always buys me a drink or a dessert when I'm there
They have a large menu, the Carne is a little pricy, as always, but well worth it
The black tanglierne pasta is incredible, probably the best on the menu
If you're brave, you could try the rabbit
The atmosphere is fantastic and they play excellent music
(if you like frank sinatra
)
Went here on a date after hearing nice things from friends
We were promptly seated downstairs by the indoor waterfall which was very nice
It looked like it would be a great place for a private party as well as a date
As for the food, it was very good
I had roasted salmon and my date had veal
both were very tasty
The service was very attentive
I'd recommend it to others
Went here on March 23,2005 for a special night out with my daughter after a broadway show
Was not impressed with food at all
I ordered a pasta with shrimp,clams, and mussels
There were 4 mussels 4 baby clams and the smallest shrimp I have ever seen in my life,the kind that would come out of a can
There was absolutly no taste!When the waiter came over and saw a full plate I told him I was done
He wondered why I hadn't eaten and I told him I didnt care for it
No one really seem to care!My daughter had plain pasta with marinara and she said it was so bland
Wont be back
To many real Italian restaurants in Manhatten
took prior reviews to make a reservation
We were seated downstairs barely still in the restaurant and there was a table of about 10 (mothers and their mid-teen aged daughters) who were SO loud it was destroying any ambience that was in the place
I spoke to the manager who did not have the guts to ask the table to stop shouting (he said there was nothing he could do) even though 4 other tables of diners were being disturbed and sent over his poor waiter! The other tables let out a sigh of relief when the shouting stopped--manners anyone? Chicken was dry, lasagna was average, manager was indifferent
After researching a ton of different restaurants, who wouldn't take or hold a reservation for 18 people, I finally found this place wow!! It was my sister's bachelorette party, and they were so great to us!! The wait staff could not have been anymore solicituous! It's a fun place with good music, good food, a good price!
My wife I went here after hearing good things about it from friends
The ambiance was very nice
We sat downstairs in the indoor garden by the waterfall, very romantic
The wine selection was great and the food was even better
The waiters were courteous and attentive
We'll be back
I felt I was in Seinfelds diner - Just what the doctor ordered, great food in a traditional US diner
We ate at the Red Flame Diner every morning for a week on our vacation
It's always busy but we were seated quickly every day
There's a steady traffic of locals and holiday makers who all enjoy the very reasonably priced food
Service is efficient and generally pleasant and food is hearty and plentiful
Breakfast menu offers all the usual fare with enough choice to keep the average diner more than happy
Highly recommended!
For Bar its great Place, Bur for food its not recomended, Its like a McDonalds
Try to Next Door
Dervish Good food and Great value
We found Langan's quite by accident in 2001 and now make it a point to go back every time we are in town
The burgers are fantastic--esp if you are like me and enjoy them on the rare side
Just got back from NYC and Langan's gave us a great respite on a very HOT afternoon
Sit at the bar and enjoy the ambiance--you won't regret it
My boyfriend and I stopped into Langans after seeing a Broadway Show
We really enjoyed the atmosphere and hospitality
The food was wonderful and the staff were great
We did not realize from the outside of the restaurant that they had such a big (and nice) dining area
We also had a cocktail at the bar and vowed we would come back
We recommend it highly
My girfriend and I were over in the Times Square theatre district, trying to get cheap tickets for her visiting parents
No luck, we were frustrated and hungry, and she remembered having a good time at a party at Langan's on West 47th Street
She's not a fan of Irish pubs, neither am I, but Langan's seemed a much better choice than all the fast food chains in Times Squarew
We walked into Langan's and it was the classiest pub I've ever seen, great long wooden bar, mahogony walls, etched glass
We sat at the bar and the pretty barmaid suggested Langan's Ale for me, my girl had a glass of wine
The beer was cold and fresh, really thirst-quenching
Then I had a steak caesar salas, and my girlfriend ordered chicken curry;she asked for it semi-spicy and that's what she got
The food was unbelievably good, we wanted to order seconds
The crowd around us was mixed: tourists, corporate types, people just hanging out
My experience with Irish pubs has been noisy, rowdy crowds and blaring TVs
Langan's has real atmosphere
So instead of taking her parents to the theatre, my girlfriend decided to take them to Langan's and let them eat well, in a cozy environement that won't cost me a fortune
All good
I recomment you check out Langan's
I had the unfortunate experience of eating at Langan's after theater one evening
While the food and table service was fine, it was my decision to move to the bar after dinner that ruined this evening
The bartender's drunken girlfriend and her obnoxious companion were seated at the end of the bar and for no apparent reason began verbally abusing my date and I
I have never had an evening this like in my entire life
If the mgmt prefers to have their staff give away free alcohol to their friends over paying customers I wonder how they stay in business
Will not return
I went for a pre theatre dinner and it was deliciOUS! the waiters were friendly and attentive to every detail and were fabulous
I felt very relaxed and enjoyed my whole meal
Might i recommend the mud cake for dessert and the steak for main dish
I would absolutly go there again!
Celebrating my birthday with a dear Irish friend I had the excellent Langan's ale, a delicious talapia (Chilean sea bass) sitting on an Irish latke (potato pancake)
Tasty bread and mre Langan's ale made for a wonderful lunch, pleasantly served
The charming manager came over and made sure all was well and mentioned a midsummer's St Patrick's Day celebration! All in all a great place in midtown
The pre-fixe menu is decent
The food was good, nothing to be blown away by, but I really liked the atmosphere of the retaurant
They had a live jazz singer, and it was just really laid back
The service could have been better
The waiter never checked to make sure our meal was going well, and it was hard flagging them down but maybe because the atmosphere was relaxing, we didn't mind that much
I would recommend this restaurant if you're going to see a show later that night or if you're in the area already
I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was around the nieghborhood, I would eat here again
By far the best ambience of the Times Square restaurants that we tried over Labor Day
Great staff and food with the major exception of the tiramisu
We had the fix prixe menu featuring steak and including dessert
The tiramisu didn't have any coffee taste and in fact tasted spoiled or stale
The waitress didn''t return for a long time after dessert was served so I couldn't complain while my dining companion finished her dessert without complaint

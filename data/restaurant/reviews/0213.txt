Zuppa de pesce is great
Nice spot to share appetizers dont be surprised if it takes all night service stinks
I would not recommend eating here
Totally overpriced and VERY slow service
Pasta tastes like school cafeteria food
Please don't go here
The only redeemable part was the outside seating and the neighborhood
There were some inconsistant review, but our dinner was quite good
The seafood/lobster special was very good, well prepared, and well presented
The baked clams could have been a bit larger, but were very tasty
the service was attentive, but not obnoxious
A good experience
Also I liked the link to gangster history-the murder of Joey Gallo
I live around the corner so it's quick to pick up
Food is alright but unreasonably priced
When I call in an order after a quick look at menupages they always tell me the menu I have is old and they don't serve said food anymore or they charge 5 or more then the price listed
If anyone assosiated with Virage reads this, UPDATE YOUR MENU!!!!!
This is my husband and my go-to place when we don't feel like trying some place new
I especially love the chicken cous-cous and rabbit dishes
Virage is mellow, quiet enough for good conversation, and never too crowded
Yet, they still serve some excellent dishes
The waiter asked me if I wanted to order even though he knew I was still waiting for someone
Besides that strange incident, the service was very friendly and prompt
The food was delicious and reasonably priced
I ordered a Croque Monsieur and it came with fries
I was able to eat half and take half home for dinner, and it tasted good leftover too! The sidewalk seating was optimal but it helped that we happened to be under the only umbrella
I would definitely return
This place is a valuable asset to the east village
It's been my regular brunch place for the past three years (I go 1-2 times /month) and I have never had a bad experience
Very consistent, mid-range in price, Virage has an overall quality feel to it
You get your dose of east village 'scene-lite' and some tasty grub, all without the attitude
I like
I used to go here for wkend brung a couple years ago
It was pretty good back then
Just went back recently, and had a terrible experience! My 9 yr old niece could have made a better huevos rancheros then the slop that I was given
My wife's omelette was pretty abysmal as well
The bread tasted stale, and hard
The quality has gone way way down at this place, while the prices have not
Don't waster your money here
It took us 20 minutes to get coffee at 9:30am on a sunday when there was only 1 other customer; music was entirely too loud
The huevos rancheros looked pathetic- the eggs were overly cooked, lying on a bowl of black beans which tasted like they came out of a can- it came with a salsa, or so they said it was
Price was way too high for the quality of the food
We only went there since there are so few breakfast places open before 10am on sundays, but it may be worth it to stay in bed till a real brunch place opens up
I've been to this restaurant several times and I've always left feeling great
The variety of food is impressive
The steaks are always tasty and done to perfection
The large variety of appetizers is inspiring and all the ones I've tried were very good
Located on the corner of 2nd 7th, Virage offers a great lunch special for $7
95
I had tuna salad sandwich with fries and soup of the day
Service was quick and efficient
The brightly lit dining area is adorn with polished brick-work, tasteful decor and rustic floor
Big plus is it's walking distance to Astor Pl
, Orpheum Theatre, and McSorley's Bar
This east village little corner spot is great for brunch, weeknight dinner or casualdate
The menu includes delightful salmon, tasty burgers
For brunch the goat cheese fratatta is delicious and the mini muffins are a welcome treat
Service and staff are polite and energetic
Consistently a pleasant experience and great value
There was 5 of us in the group and EVERYONE loved their meal
I highly recommend the shrimp/crab sandwich
The burgers were great, the steak sandwich was great
everything was just terrific
The value was AWESOME!!!! We do not eat in the city often, but we will definitely come back here!!!
A quaint little spot to get lunch or better yet, brunch on weekends
The food is great, the service good and a charming ambience
no
it's not a mirage
it's VIRAGE! it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends
it has an intimate setting with dimmed lights and candles at each table
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner
The food is good, not great (although the fries are tasty)
The service is pleasant but also inattentive and slow
If you can flag a waitress down, shell be happy to get you what you need
in due time
The decor is nothing special, but you feel comfortable
Price-wise, it really doesnt seem too bad ($16 for a steak and fries, $9 for a burger, and good wine for $30)
In a nutshell, if youre hungry and you happen to be in the area, eating at Virage wouldnt the worst move you could make
Prices have gone up, while food is about the same: solid, if uninspired Mediterranean food
Brunch isn't so hot
For 2 weeks we planned every detail from food to decor
We increased my budget because afterall, why not do it right
They completely sold me on choosing them
I was told to wait for the contract
The contract never came
Days later I got a fax telling me that they could no longer do my party
They didn't even have the decency to call or recommend another caterer after leading me on to the point that I had canceled all other options
They were terribly rude, obnoxious and unapologetic
I would not waste my time with them
My fiance and I adore this restaurant
We have been here a handfull of times and every meal is wonderful
On our second visit, the staff remembered us and seated us at our table
The atmosphere is warm and friendly
The staff are attentive and welcoming
The food is to die for
We have been to other restaurants in Little Italy and this restaurant by far has the best tasting food
The portions are enough that you will be full and satiated
Almost everytime we go out to eat, we go to this restaurant

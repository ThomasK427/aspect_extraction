Attentive but never overbearing, and we were allowed to linger without ever feeling rushed (maybe because we continued to order champagne?) The food was top notch, and the little extras much appreciated
I can't recommend this restaurant enough
I feel that almost every NYC restaurant is too expensive, I have a lousy paying job and I was on a tight budget that night, so don't go by me
I must say that our waiter was good, he didn't embarrass me because I ordered the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu, and because I handed him a coupon while my date was in the bathroom
Tacky, huh? The crabcakes were great but the sushi appetizer was fair and the cold seafood app was skimpy
Great views of the rink and a very nice staff
the service was surpurb
the food was great
the skaters were poor but made for great entertainment
The Sea Grill is a great sea food restaurant in the middle of rockefellar plaza overlooking the rink with glass windows, a great looking bar and restaurant with excellent and flattering service, decor and ofcourse, the food is the best part! The fish is fresh and very well prepared with exotic sauces
worth a trip!
The fish was perfectly done and sauced
Our table overlooked the rink, and it was quite romantic even though the place is a bit stark
Attentive service, good wine, great food, subtle decor
This is an impressive restaurant
I saw a lot of business people dining around us, and some couples (weekday)
Very romantic atmosphere in the central of Rockefeller Center
Delicious food and great service
Came here with the Dine Out NY certificate
The restaurant is kind of hidden
Need to take the glass dome elevator down in order to locate the sea grill
The atmosphere is very quiet, and romantic
I felt like I wasn't in NYC anymore! The service is excellent
We had a very cute server
The food was excellent
Try the clam chowder
Desserts were very inventive and adorable looking
The thing that stood out about this restaurant was the service
Great service, great food
A little pricey but really worth it in the winter time where you can look at the people ice skating at rockefeller center
some very good, some not so good
fresh tomato salad and ginger-carrot soup were delicious
i had the lobster dinner
the lobster was sweet and tender, but the mussels were undercooked
my guest had the crispy tuna roll
the tuna was overcooked
dessert is standard
I went to the sea grill using the doine out new york offer ($25 off an entree) - anyhow I expected a great dinner but i got the exact opposite
3 out of 10 entrees were sold out at 8PM on a Saturday night and I had to choose 2 entrees in case one of them were also sold out
What kind of rest
makes you choose an alternate? Anyhow, the food was decent but def
not large portions - my boyfriend's entree looked more like an appetizer, and all we got out of the dinner was a $100 tab and hunger for more food
A wonderful setting for lunch - as long as you can put the bill on a corporate card
Great spot for tourist-watching, it was hilarious how they all tried to walk through the restaurant in order to reach the Rockefeller Center shopping concourse
The fish is prepared delicately and tastes like it came straight from Fulton St
Beautiful restaurant and food that's wonderful
Lot of power lunches going on around you and lunch for two is about $150 with tip, two glasses of wine and one dessert! What the heck, we were on vacation! We didn't get a seat by the window to see the skaters, you should go for a very late lunch to get one of those tables unless you are a regular
Chef Ed Brown has SUCH a way with fish!  I still remember the firts dish I ate that he made -- pumpkin soup with Nantucket Scallops
The atmosphere is a little touristy, but get over it and go there for the delicious seafood
after reading the reviews, i wasn't expecting to be too impressed
however, i'm happy to report that i had a very pleasant dinner with a dineout coupon
salmon roll entree was good and shellfish apps were even better
great service! my friend and i were served a complimentary app and after-dinner treat
regular prices are high, but not ridiculous when considering that you're sitting under the stars on the (winter) ice rink!
In Short With all the commotion in Rockefeller Center it's easy to miss the discreet glass elevator descending to this underground cafe
Below, an expansive window frames the singular views of the skating rink and gold Prometheus fountain overshadowing the art deco interior
Out-of-towners munch on signature risotto crab cakes, house-made pappardelle and double chocolate--white and milk--mousse
In warmer months, the rink converts to an outdoor bar providing revelers more room for happy hour
We went here to watch the skaters
We simply went for the atmosphere and view and really did not expect the food to be much
What a surprise
It was our best meal in NYC
The prime rib and chicken scalloppine were delicious and the service was quite good
Although it took about a half hour to get a table with a view of the skaters, those who were not as particular were being seated fairly quickly
Next time we are in New York we definitely will go back for a fine meal
Went here for Thanksgiving Dinner
Had reservation
Those that didn't weren't treated very well - and never got past the front door
Very busy and loud
Server was just OK
Had a pre plated dinner, shrimp and steak were extra charges
$200 for three for dinner without drinks seems a little high for what we got
Neat experience, but wouldn't do it again
Went here for dinner - top notch service and excellent food, wine and view of ice rink
Went the next day for lunch - menu too pricey for lunch and the waiter was the WORST !! Usually we tip very well - left him 10%
The food was great
I definitely recommend the daily seared fish entree
Fish was very tasty and well-cooked
Also, I had a bite of friend's duck entree and it was amazing
It didn't have a gamey taste
Also, you get a great view of the ice skating rink
My only complaint was that the place is not very well-ventiliated
I was pretty cold during my whole entire meal
My family and I ate there on Christmas day and had a great time! The food was excellent, and the service was amazing
Nobody rushed us through the 3 courses, and we had a great view of the rink
We will definitely be visiting the Rock Center Cafe every trip we take to New York, it was a highlight of our trip
We had Thanksgiving dinner at Rock Center
The grilled polenta appetizer with shaved Parmiggiano was amazing
We both had the traditional turkey dinner and weren't disappointed
Even the pumpkin pie was great, and we are quite picky about our pumpkin pie
There is a nice romantic atmosphere and it overlooks the Rockefeller center rink
Highly recommended, but make reservations
I like this restaurant better as a lunch spot, where the food is a bit less pricey
The waiters I've had have been friendly and courteous, and the service and dining experience was good overall
The view definitely adds to the charm of this restaurant, making what would ordinarily be a place with above average to good food, a good place to come and eat
You pay a bit for the view in the prices, it is true, but it's worth it
If in midtown, it is definitely worth going to at least once, if only to judge for yourself
Great location with great views! Above average food and very attentive friendly service! The crab cakes are one of the best in the city
The weekend brunch is a great value
Went there a few months ago, and while the food was really good, and I was ready for it to be pricey, the one thing that bothered me was the waiter was standing in a corner watching us eat

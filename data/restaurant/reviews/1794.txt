Would do it over in a second
We were seated promptly, hostess/host were both nice, service was excellent, (traditional) tasting menu was out of this world, especially with the paired wines
Informative at every step of the meal
Dining room is serene and relaxing, not too quiet or noisy
Waitstaff is friendly
No snobbery going on here
Can't say a bad thing! Overall, better than I expected, and I expected a lot
you can eat at the bar, and we got in twice this trip without reservations (go early or go late, not at peak hours)
The bartenders, and all the staff were knowledgable, helpful, and treated us two middle-aged tourists from Texas as great as they treated their hip regulars
The food, of course, is unusual, thoughtful, and surprising
It's not for everyone, but it was great!
Three of my family members dined at Babbo recently and had a great meal
The duck was excellent
Pastas very, very good
And one of the deserts--a gelato sampler (served in egg holders) was a big hit
Only downside is the Forever it takes to get a reservation
Will return!
My wife and I had dinner at Babbo yesterday
Sommelier and wait staff were helpful and attentive
The marinated fresh sardines and grilled octopus antipasti were excellent
The mint love letters and spaghettini primi we ordered as entrees were perfection
But, the best kept secret about Babbo, (I haven't seen any mention of it) is the bombolino with vanilla cream and apricot spread for dessert
We had a difficult time deciding on what to order because the menu and the food coming out of the kitchen looked awesome
Considering that this is one of the top restaurants if not the top restaurant in the city it is not terribly expensive
An unparalled dining experience
10 out of 10!
After spending a little under $600
00 for 4 people for dinner we were definitely being rushed out
My business partner and I take our clients to the best restaurants in Manhattan
There have been only 3 restaurants that have pushed us out: Danube- actually blew out our candle!; Eleven Madison Park- gave us the check without asking us if we would like antyhing else; and Babbo- gave us the check without a word, the Maitre de came upstairs just to our table to ask us if everything was okay and the busboys were taking everything they possibly could from our table
There was NO air conditioning on a 90 degree day- we thought we were going to die! When I mentioned it to the waitperson he apologized and said it was acting up
But the entire time we were perspiring!
In order to live up it's reputation and prices, Babbo was going to have to be one of the best restaurant experiences of my life
And it nearly was
Let me just say that the food was amazing
Not your usual red and cream sauce NYC italian food by any means
All of the dishes showed off a true depth of imagination
Like Mint Love Letters: Ravioli stuffed with peas and fava beans served with a spicy lamb sausage sauce and fresh mint! It doesn't get much better! The wine service was the only draw back
Of course there is no way that I could be as familiar with the list as the Sommelier, but that does mean that he had to act like customers aren't qualified to pick out their own wines
He was the only snob in the joint however
Had dinner here last night with family
Place was warm and spacious
Seated promptly though the maitre 'd seemed snooty
Our waitress was nice but hard to find at times
Wine was great
Appetizer of grilled octopus was amazing
Pasta menu was great
Beef cheek ravioli was my favorite
The goose liver ravioli was good but a little on the sweet side
The spaghetti w/lobster was mediocre
Main courses I was most upset by
largely mediocre
The pork tenderloins were small and the broth they served it with was sweet
My sister had the lambchops and were not good
Dessert was better but nothing amazing
Chocolate cake matched with hazelnut gelato was good
Dinner came out to $300 for 4 people
Overall, I wasn't impressed
For the money, Gotham or a ton of other restaurants offer better service, more inventive food and overall better dining for the money
Once you have food at Babbo, you will never want to eat at another resturant in the city again!  All the way to service, food, ambiance, bar, etc
everything was perfect
All resturants should be exactly this way
THough it may be pricey, it is well worth it and the long reservation wait is well worth it as well
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BABBO!
Lots of people have attested to how good the food at Babbo is and I agree with all of them
I also think Babbo treats their customers better than any other well known, high end restaraunt in NYC
Some examples:  Babbo keeps 4 tables in the front open for people without a reservation
You can order the full menu at the bar
Actually Babbo's bar is starting to look like cafeteria lately
Babbo is extremely loyal to loyal customers
I've probably eaten at Babbo 20-25 times in 2 years
After you go a few times, you notice they start to look out for you
Tables come quicker, waiters/bartenders comp you things, etc
That's not snobbish, that's taking care of people who support your business
I wish I could find more restaraunts in the city that supported regulars the way Babbo does
After hearing many many good reviews from friends, I have wanted to check this place out for a long while and it was well worth any wait
The food at Babbo is unique and delightful
The combinations are rich and very complimentary in nature
This place isn't for those who are timid in their tastebuds! The wait staff was pleasant
Had early reservations and was seated upstairs, which can be a brightly lit room on a clear day, but as the sun sets, the atmosphere can get very romantic
Had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this place
Having been to to almost all of the top 50 restaurants in NYC, I was absolutely thrilled to finally get to go to Babbo
The menu was challenging at first because we didn't know what most of the items were, but our waiter very patiently and pleasantly answsered all our questions and everything we got from Appetizers, Pasta, Main Courses and Desserts were absolutely wonderful
All the dishes from the other tables that went past us smelled heavenly
I highly recommend Babbo
Was here a couple of weeks ago, and it has to be some of the best food I've had in NYC
We were seated promptly, our table was on the second floor; key in enjoying this place, I think
Waiter was very knowledgable, if a little pretentious, but as long as you know your stuff and don't hover while I eat, I don't care
Sommalier was great
He and our resident wine expert had an interesting conversation about a few wines not on the menu they both loved
After that he took the time to find a similar bottle, and another that was his favorite
Try the goose liver raviolis
The beef cheeks were a bit of a let down for me, but then anything after those raviolis was
Also go for the maple marscapone cheesecake
Agree that it is not traditional italian, but done very well
Will be back
Babbo is good, but it's not Italian in the classic sense
It's a fun restaurant with good food (although the chef doesn't change his menu as much as he used to, or challenge himself or his kitchen staff)
But it's not like you're going to find much classic food there, like you would at Il Mulino, or Beppe, or Scalinatella
or even Lupa

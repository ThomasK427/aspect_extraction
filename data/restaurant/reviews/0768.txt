It is ok
Overall, I prefer the one on Park
I have to say that Dos Caminos was much better than I had expected
I had also heard some negative things, but I had a nice dinner
The guac is great and compares to Rosa Mexicano and the dishes are good
I had the tamale stuffed with chicken and served with rice
It was tasty and I enjoyed it
The drinks are overpriced and small!! There is probably not even a shot of tequilla in one of their margs
I had the passion fruit marg which was good, but not worth 10 dollars
I would go back to Dos Caminos, but I know there is better Mexican elsewhere
The service is hit or miss as well
Our waitress was nice, but nowhere to be found
I've been to Dos Caminos on Park Avenue religiously
I have to admit the sister in Soho, is great and will shine just as much as the one on Park Avenue in a month or two
The guac of course is amazing and they REALLY dont kid around about their spicy level guac
If it's spice that you want this sequel has it to offer
Yet another great Steve Hanson restaurant in Soho
I'd heard the original Dos Caminos was excellent
It may be--who knows (we're big fans of Rosa Mexicano, and heard the guacamole here would be just as good or better)
We showed up, ordered guacamole and drinks and
got the guac but no drinks until it was all gone (approximately 20 minutes later)
We could never find our waitress when we needed her
We frequently were without water
The place was full of drunk, screaming scenesters and we had to shout--like at a club--to hear each other
I ordered the shrimp, which tasted fishy and tough
Don't go! Rosa Mexicano is much better, if you want top notch Mexican food
In Short A neighborhood spot with an authentic interior--from the wooden tables and chairs to the shelves lined with bottles of wine
Out back, grapevines shade a charming dining area complete with hanging lanterns and potted plants
Pastas like paccheri--large tubes of pasta with seafood in a saffron sauce--are reasonably priced
The mango ice cream tartufo and homemade tiramisu are both great dessert choices
Overpriced for poor service and poor food
This is a chain restaurant with another one on Bleeker Street
Wine selection based on high price for very ordinary wine
I went here last night with four people
The atmostphere is awesome, very laid back and rustic in a good way
Great wine
However, the food is average
I would rate it a 7
5
Out of four different appetizers and four entrees at our table, nothing was outstanding
The service was so slow that it caused us to miss a play we had tickets to
With some management changes and a new chef, this place would be much better
From the moment I walked in I felt like I had stumbled upon a true Italian kitchen
the atmosphere is outstanding! And the outdoor patio in the back garden has real grape vines growing! The food is really good as well
I had been for a party a long time ago and then rediscoverd it for a wine tasting recently -- and they changed a few things, but the flavors are still fabulous
The staff was perfectly pleasent to me
the food may have been slow, but I really didn't mind
I don't like feeling rushed
Bravo!
Have enjoyed this restaurant for a number of years under the name of Baldo Vino
It has been renamed Ciao but the menu and dishes have remained largely unchanged
Food and drink still excellent, especially the gnocchi, linguine white clam sauce and meat dishes
Ambience still cozy and prices are still very reasonable
All in all, will keep me coming back
Service can be slow at times but all in all friendly
The service at this restaurant is extremely slow
The staff speaks limited english and they have a haughty attitude
The food has far too much salt
which can be a problem because once you run out of water its next to impossible to get more
This excess of salt was not only present in the pasta, but inexplicably in the salad as well
The furnishings may look rustic, but the tables are in fact rickety and the wooden chairs are very uncomfortable
If you go , expect a salty substandard meal in uncomfortable seating with terrible service
Don't go - I wish I hadn't
This restaurant is FABULOUS! We always sit outdoors (because it is a little crowded indoors) and the food is wonderful! The butter and sage gnocchi is mouth-wateringly good, as are all their pastas, and they have a lot of great wines by the glass
The food never disappoints us, and we've been there several times! And on the one occasion where we had bad waitservice, the managerial staff really picked up the slack
We take everyone we know there, and you should too!
Went on a Saturday night w/ 6
service was excellent, very attentive and helpful
Food was very good--not overdone, comfortable and reasonably priced
Wine list has several elegant picks--highly recommend the Barbara D'Alba, an exceptional Piedmont
The patio is the only way to go weather permitting; I felt like we were in a friends back yard
Ciao!
My wife and I dined here both before and after our honeymoon in Italy and found the food at Baldo Vino to be on par with what we had in Italy! Ambience is casual cozy, the food is terrific, and the price is right
Great for a casual outing if you really want good Italian food
Best gnocchi that I've had in NYC
This restaurant has a wonderful, small bar in front and a cozy, beautiful atmosphere throughout
There's also outdoor seating
The hosts and waitstaff are also very pleasant - no attitude
You can enjoy a nice glass of wine at the bar or a very good Italian meal at decent prices in the restaurant
Perfect solo or for groups or anything in between, really
Nice neighborhood vibe
I had to try this place after so many glowing reviews from friends - and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations
The environment was warm and cozy - the type of of place that made me want to introduce myself to strangers
It had a festive feel
The food and wine was the best we've had in the City
I can't recommend this place strongly enough!!!!!!!!!
So
I'm sure the food's great, etc, etc
but when the hostess (more like a stale twinky) sat us at a garden table in the middle of a dark alley it was over before it began
We weren't sure if they were planning on serving us or mugging us
As they were pouring our water we were walking out the door
I've been here before and the food has always been good although the service slow
Tonight was the worst by far! After an hour and 20 minutes, we had to finally inquire where our food was and saw our waiter's face go pale as he realized he never entered it
We decided to ask for our check for the wine we had and the waiter became completely annoyed at us! He was exasperated that we didn't want to wait
We explained that the 4 tables around has were seated way after and were already eating dessert, and that we just wanted to leave
The manager came over and was no better
He just waved us off and handed us the check without apology
Better food than Frank, better service than Il Bagatto
Angelo (manager) is the type of gracious restaurant host we all long for but rarely come across in this city
And the food there is great as well at very reasonable prices

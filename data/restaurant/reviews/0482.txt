Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
This was the best restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life! It's crazy to pass this place by!
I have enjoyed DJ Garden for years
It is without a doubt the best Chinese food in Jersey City -- and I've tried a bunch
The portions are big, the food tasted great, and the prices are great
I highly recommend you try it out
In Short Founded in 1961 in Colorado, Chart House now has more than 25 U
S
locations
The restaurants, many of which occupy historic buildings, draw on the local region's natural features, making each one unique
Fresh fish and seafood dominate the menu with offerings like jumbo lump crab cakes, mahi mahi and Australian lobster tail
For landlubbers, there's prime rib, filet mignon and N
Y
strip steak
Sweet finishes include hot chocolate lava cake and raspberry creme brulee
I'm happy that at least one person writing a review agrees with my assessment of the Chart House
The food was not good
The service was even worse
The waitress seemed much more interested in servicing a new table of rowdy guys than in taking care of tables she was already dealing with
We got the wrong wine and couldn't get her attention for the second bottle
Couldn't get more water and waited at least 20 minutes for our check
The seared asian scallops tasted as if they had a bottle of soy sauce poured on them (of course making them Asian)
This was my second bad experience there with food and service
However, the view is spectacular
If nothing else go for drinks
and a spectacular view
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful! Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House
The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch
the ambiance is wonderfull
The staff offers impeccable service
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz
of Maine Lobster in it
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash
It was divine melts in your mouth
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough
We had Lava Cake
we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
Before the place didn't call my attention
But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great
Best things to order are from the grill (Churrasco and Ribs)
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price
Very good food in some way romantic need to work on the service
This was probably the worst chicken chow mei fun I've ever had
The chicken had a strange spongy texture that I couldn't stomach
However, the ribs were good, and the eggrolls were average
My kids loved the lo mein
My daughter couldn't eat her sesame chicken, but managed to eat the leftovers the next day
One of my son's didn't like the General Tso's chicken, not even the next day's leftovers
My other son loved the beef on a stick
I guess the general concensus is avoid the chicken
The best thing about this place is the outdoor patio
When the weather's nice, the pool table is outside along with lots of seating, tiki torches, a mini putting green, a Model T 2 suits of armor
You totally forget you're in Botany Village
A good little italian place
Good service
Decent portions make for a filling meal
Make sure the bread comes out hot
Bring your own and you can have a great night without having to pay too much
I have been to Il Mulino dozens of times - the service is attentive and friendly, the food is fabulous (the pasta fagioli is excellent), and the best part is that it's a BYOB!
I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience, it is essential however to have some familiarity with Korean cuisine
The staff spoke little english and could not explain the dishes
However the food was good!  I would recommend going in a minimum group of 4, the number of dishes brought to the table and the portions of food were enormous!
This place is OK for a few drinks if you are in the area and don't mind hanging out in a place frequented by not cool groups of people
Make sure you do not go on Thursday (Karaoke night!)
Unless you like to hang out with all the other William Hungs of the world
The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad
We had the Pre-Theatre Prix Fixe Dinner which was the only menu offered the night that we went
Initially, we were disappointed that we couldn't order a la carte and it was a very limited choice but we were quite surprised at how good each course was
We dined on shrimp cakes, prime rib with chipotle bbq sauce, pesto cod with polenta and flourless chocolate cake
We were impressed with each dish!
Diva Lounge is one of my favorite places to go to if I am not in the mood to head into NYC
The decor can best be described as plush and the clientele is top notch
The age range is between 25-35 on a typical Saturday night and DJ Gerb spins great house music to chill or groove to (ask him about his mixes for sale)
Be sure to dress to impress or you might not get in
The drinks are pricey, but the service is excellent
Fridays are a younger crowd and the music is more progressive
The couches are cleared out for a big dance floor
Diva's reminds me of a supper club that you would find in South Beach
Many people don't even go there for the good food, but they come in at 11pm for the dancing
Saturday night starts out loungy and ends up with a full dance floor
Deep and soulful house music earlier in the night and straight-up jammin' house tracks later on
There's even a morrocan dancer girl that does her thing for about 15 minutes

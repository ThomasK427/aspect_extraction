This place is great with food, and their service is good and they usually have nice Salsa playing in the background
The food taste authentic! The price is really good too! They make great mojitos!
At Boca Chica you will get well-cooked food; however, it won't actually be true Brazilian, but true Carribean
You will pay an average of $10
00 to 15
00 for a huge plate of food
Accompaning fish or meat are some hefty side dishes such as white rice, black beans, yucca, radish, tomato, and green pepper salad, or plaintains cooked a variety of different ways
As for the ambience, it is quaint, a dimly-lit hip place, but it is loud
You have to scream in order to hold a conversation
Lastly, the drinks are pricy but are compensated by being strong, so be careful
Whether on a date or out with the girls, this place is always a great way to kick off the night
Great food and drinks and the serivce is nice too!
Boca chica is the greatest
Their shrimp and steak are wonderful
Waitstaffs are very frendly and attentive
The Place is very cute and so is manager
He doesn't look like a guy on GQ but he is very charming!!! You will be satisfied with everything there
Just Go!!!
Boca Chica has it all -- great ambiance, great food, great drinks, great value, great service
It's a little small so you might have to wait for a table but it is well worth it
The food here ranges from good to very good
It does not deserve a rating above 9 on this website, but it is very tasty and reasonably priced--probably should have an 8
The best deal I've found in the neighborhood, though, which is generally overpriced
Steak was fantastic
Chicken was good, but about the quality a very good cook would make at home
Sides were all delicious
Drinks weak, but big, so they add up to a good deal
Dined there twice
First try was so-so, had arroz con pollo, not great
Second time was a disaster, a tilapia that was way frozen then overcooked
Not worth the money
The waitress knew she shouldn't have recommended it: she never came back to ask how my entree was
Don't let the location or fun vibe fool you
the taste of this food is serious--as in amazing
The drinks are good and the service was perfect
Take a chill date or good friend
If you love great food and ambiance go here! Anytime we are in the area we go
On weekends there is somewhat of a wait but worth it and the waiters are not five star but efficient
A vibrant little spot to try plaintains cooked every which way and enjoy a few strong margaritas for a good price
Good menu selection and well prepared dishes
Evey dish we ordered was SO good, and really reasonably priced
Margaritas are very good and very strong, the sangria was so-so
Fun, lively vibe
I remember when this place opened in the late 80s
I took me a while to visit, and I don't go often (about once a year), but whenever I'm in the mood for some very good pan-Latin food, I skip the scene at Patria or Chicama, and head over to Boca Chica
It's a 20-something crowd enjoying the good value (read: very inexpensive)
Very loud, small room, but the food is very good, and so is the friendly, accomodating service
I always get the Camarones Chipolte, spicey, smokey, great beans
The drinks are excellent
One of the best mojitos and margaritas in the city, for a very good price--two of these and I'm loopy
The coconut flan for desert is very good
Boca Chica is a winner
I hope they say around for a long time
Boca Chica is an old-timer in this ever-flactuating corner of EV
Years ago they would clear out the tables after midnight and turn the restaurant into a steamy brazillian/salsa dance hall
It was a blast
Today it's just a ho-hum restaurant with mediocre food
Our chicken breast special looked pretty, but was terribly dried out and overcooked
The penionitas, advertised as filled with spicy meat, were very sweet and hardly spicy, like bananas stuffed with hamburger helper
The fillet of fish with tomato sauce was mostly a lot of sauce on top of a very thin fillet
With so many better nearby choices, this place needs to shape up
almost always it's easy to get a table right away, plantains for appetizer are amazing and the service is usually quick
good for a couple or a group of friends! dinner or weekend brunch
Great margaritas, after a few sips I was already tipsy
A great spot to go with friends or on a date
the food is pretty good too
Tasty, tasty, tasty! Boca Chica has a cool Cuban vibe going on combined with great inexpensive food
The plaintains with a slightly spicy black bean dip were a nice extra and the main dishes deliver as well
Try the pastel for an interesting combination of cornmeal, black beans and olives with a side of rice and beans
Get yourself a corona and you're good to go!
I had a nice dinner there last night
The waiters couldn't stop refilling our water
The complimentary plantain chips were tasty, and I appreciated the vegetarian entrees especially since this restaurant concentrates on their ultra-fresh vegetables
It's a reasonable restaurant with a fun atmosphere, and there's always something new to look at
I stopped by for drinks a few months ago
The bartender was great, so were the drinks
We went back for dinner recently and were equally impressed with the service and the quality
Our waiter knew the menu very well and made some excellent suggestions
We had a tasty steak dish and (possibly) the best shrimp dish I've had in a restaurant
A great stop after catching a flick at Sunshine
This restaurant is very over rated, quality of food is mediocre, too pricy for the food you get
Not true to carribean or latin food at all
Never had a bad time here
Sure it's loud and you are sitting on top of one another but the food is consistenty good and authentic
No hype here, just good eats
Had a friend in from out of town and what better way to start a great nite than at Boca Chica? Good sangria, zesty food, and a fun crowd of guys at the table next to us (thanks for the tequila shots) made a very convincing argument for her to move here! Thanks for the fun memories
Unpretentious and delicious would aptly describe Boca Chica
The portions are enough for two and very affordable and the service is prompt and helpful
Who knew that plantains could be so good?The drinks are amazing -- the pina colada is so good you want to be alone with it for some quality time!  Next time you want a little bit of latin american loving, I would definitely recommend stopping by
GREAT food and friendly service
This little eatery is a favorite of mine -- close to home and just like mom's cooking
helluva good sangria
some stuff seems a little foofy but lots of good food
Going later in the eve does require some waiting
Delicious food and STRONG drinks that pack a wallop
The pork stuffed plantains are very flavorful with the perfect balance of the sweet plantains and the spicy pork
I take friends that visit from out of town so that we can all sample the dishes and have yet to be less that completely please with the food
This is a loud fun place to go
Quick service (once you get a table), and decent food
If you go on a Thurs or Fri evening be prepared to wait b/c the place gets jammed early

Great atmosphere - excellent for a date as well as hanging around with friends
The owner is wonderful - and made the night something to definetly remember
She made us all very comfortable - and our table was never without something to munch on
Overall between the service and prices - you can't beat this place - It would be a crime to miss this one
It's bright, warm and welcoming
As if the drink specials aren't reason enough to go back, the service is stellar and unpretentious and the appetizers are yummy
My friends and I checked out this place on Thursday night
The owner/host Wilma is very friendly and a sweetie
She comped our appetizers and a round of shots
She really made us feel at home
The happy hour is great value: $3 bottles $4 well drinks from 4-8
Appetizers were a tasty treat, and not too pricey either
The vibe is relaxed
It looks like there's a downstairs lounge area being built as well
Again, if you're looking for a place to chill
this is it
Loved it- LOVED IT! Fun and trendy yet comfortable and relaxed
Went To Zerza with friends for dinner and drinks
Everything was wonderful and the waitress was great
The food was tasting and authentic and the drinks were strong -the price more than reasonable- I can't wait to go back!!
The first time I went to Zerza, I was one of 4 people
We were seated promptly and had a very enjoyable dinner
Recently I arranged a birthday celebration for a friend with a larger crowd of 15 people and was disappointed with the service
The waitresses were rude and we were kept waiting an hour (or more) beyond our reservation time
Needless to say the birthday girl was less than impressed
Having said that, I very much enjoyed the food and music there
My suggestion would be to go there in small crowds, but don't try to arrange an event there
Zerza was a great spot
The atmosphere is so unique, the servers are all extremely attentive, and the food is delicous
The belly dancer added to the authenticity
Also, the fig and the rose ice creams were great finishing touches
The place is beautiful - and the food is wonderful - very nice ambiance - and the staff are fab
I will go again
Beautiful rose petal strewn surfaces, moroccan tiles, waitstaff that knows their stuff to top it all off, delicious homemade FIG ice cream
the food is the true star here, although the beautiful atmosphere is so nice, it's almost distracting
Perfectly spiced briwats, perfect hummus, and enough mezze to make a meal of
Algerian and Moroccan wines round out the experience
Only drawback is a tasty sardine dish that's just a teensy bit overcooked
Overall, a true delight!
Zerza Bar has the most incredible ambience you can imagine! I highly recomend this restaurant to everyone, anyone can go, if you are in the mood for a romantic dinner, or just want to hang out with a few friends for the night, Zerza is the place
The staff of Zerza was great also, very happy people to talk to
I have to say thank you to Radouane ElJaouhari for having such a wounderful place
Had my bachelorette party at Zerza, and I just want to thank everyone there for their excellent hospitality
The food, the service,
it was all great
Very nice atmosphere, and tasty food
I had a birthday party last Sunday at Zerza after a friend recommended it, and I wasn't dissapointed
Everyone enjoyed their meals
I had the seabass and it was just amazing
(I tasted some of my friends entrees and it was yummy
I had my bacholerette party at Zerza and we had the best time! The food and the service was were TOP notch
The bar area got a little too crowded but the ambiance was great
We had a good time and we plan to go back
Zerza has it all- nice ambience, delicious food and a VERY attentive waitstaff
I went with a few friends for my birthday
It was a perfect setting for our celebration
Everything we ordered tasted divine and the service was impeccable
We happily lingered after the meal, enjoying each other's company and soaking up the atmosphere
That makes me think this would be a great place for a date, too
This is a great restaurant, we go there 2 / 3 times a week
The food is excellent, and the ambiance is great
I have to say I never had a better steak than the one I had at Zerza
What a pleasant surprise
Yes, my friends decided to go to Zerza on New Year's eve
we walk upstairs, I was totally surprised, Rose petals on the floor, romantic setting, nice music
I was like wow, you don't expect this down in this area
We had a fabulous time, I recomend this place
The food very good, and the drinks were really good too
Zerza you got my vote :)
Zerza is a trully Marocain place
For those who loves Maroc go there you will be surprised and really pleased, you feel like overthere across the ocean, for the other you should better try once in your life a chicken bastilla or a prune/apricot/ almonds tajine
excellent food really excellent!!!  The staff is really busy running every where but always with a smile and always to please the guest so what ever negative review I've read on this place, this restaurant is my one of my best experience so far in NYC
We went there on my birthday las week, we were (14 of us), first although the place is relativly small, it's cute nicely decorated and romantic
My birthday was a success! :) The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly, we all loved it and yes, we will be back!
I read about Zerza before but I just decided to give it a try
I was not dissapointed
Delicious food and nice service
I especially loved the Chicken Bastila, my date had lamb w/ apricots and pruunes both dishes were tasty
We plan to go back
Slow, slightly overworked staff but nice food and atmosphere
The space feels a little crowded -- too many tables in a small space, but overall, not a bad place if you're looking for a cozy ethnic restaurant
Also, it's on the same street as all those indian restaurants, in case you change your mind
The most classic dish is called 'tagine'
That's what I tried
I've been to Zerza 3 times this month, and it's always a great experience
I love the food there, the staff, and the music
I'm happy I found this place
:)
I was shoked to see some of the negative reviews here: I've been In Zerza 5 times since it's openning a few months ago, and I haven't experienced ANY of the problems mentioned in the negative reveiws
The food is excellent, the atmosphere is very nice and relaxing, with some really good Maroccan/Arabic music, the owner is a very nice person, and really makes you feel welcome
It's a great place and does have a very special touch
I am definetely coming back for more
Cheers!
Who would ever thought that we would found such restaurant on 6th street was my wife and my impression when we visited Zerza last night
We enjoyed the romantic setting upstairs, and the food was just excellent
The chicken with their spicy sauce was just amazing
we will go back everytime we come back to New York
My wife and I have eaten here a bunch of times, and we think it is fantastic
The food is top-notch (Moroccan cigars, briouats, fish tagine, kefta tagine, zaaluk, pissaladiere, you name it!), the service is spectacular and the owner, Radouane Eljaouhari, and his wife are such incredibly nice people
In New York, it is rare to find restaurant owners who take such a personal interest in making sure that their establishment is providing superior food, service and atmosphere

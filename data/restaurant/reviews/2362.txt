Prompt and Friendly
Nice atmosphere
good for groups
So yummy! And they have funny little monkeys flying near the bar
don't worry, they aren't real
the restaurant was overpriced and generic
there was nothing that made it cost that much
my duck was burned and for 50+ dollars i want a nice peking duck not a charcol bird
Far and away the finest Chinese food in the city
We try not to order the same things all the time but your favorites become your favorites
Beijing Duck, crispy and juicy, shrimp balls that make your heart sing (and clog up!) and a wonderful fried fish
Beware the dumplings unless you are in the cafe for dim sum
they can be disappointing
It's certainly expensive for Chinese food, and even expensive compared to all restaurants (a recent dinner for 3 cost only $20 less than a comparable recent dinner at Union Sq
Cafe), but it is well worth it for a special splurge
Forget your preconceptions about Chinese fast food and enjoy one of the greatest cuisines on earth
Always top notch at this east side stop!!! Ever since I started eating here I have never been dissapointed
It is by far one of the best chinese in town
Service is great too
The duck is worth a trip to midtown
Service is nice, though they don't need to sell other menu items like its a used car joint
Seating is comfortable
Shun Lee has one the best duck! Ever since I started eating here I have never been dissapointed
It is by far the best chinese in town
Service is great too
I've been going here for years and everytime, is a winner
Hats off to the brillant directions of owner Michael Tong and his staff
You always get just what you want if not more from them
(And the NY food critics seem to agree!)
I don't know that last time I've had such rude service! My boyfriend and I wanted a romantic evening; we sat in stunned silence at the service
The food was not great and the waitstaff ARGUED with us! My collegues often order delivery
The food was good, but last evening the woman ordertaker, no matter how many times I said it (and it was plenty) still could not get my order right
Instead of making it right, they said I didn't order right?!? Customer service is not about arguing, it's making the experience pleasant and CORRECT THE FIRST TIME!
Overstuffed sandwiches, good omeletes
Seems to be recently renovated and quite spacious for a Manhattan diner/coffee shop
This is one of my favorite lunch spots! Their lunch specials are great and inexpensive (ranging from $6-9) and they all come with soup/appetizer
I've tried alot of different things on the lunch menu and they've all been absolutely delicious
I'd highly recommend the Singapore Rice Noodles, Chirashi, and their special rolls
Also, their Wonton soup is the best I've ever had! The service is also good and attentive
I've only been here once for dinner but I think the lunch specials are definitely a better deal
Went there for lunch and everything people in my group (of 14) ordered was great
I had the salmon skin and spicy tuna, which were delicious, but was eyeing the singapore noodles and tempura that other people ordered
I heard the pork pockets were really good too
The Nagano sake was a nice touch as well
My only complaint was the temperature
I can appreciate them opening the bay doors, but at 90 degrees, they should have put on the air conditioning
In fact, I asked and the staff looked at me as though they couldn't understand me
We went here on 12/17/05 for my husbands' bday, the sushi was excellent! it was  the first time for the other couple they loved it! our waitress Sandy was very friendly  helpful! We'll definetly go back!
whoever went here and gave it a good review obviously does not eat sushi very often or care about a nice place to sit down and enjoy their meal
everything about this place was dissapointing, from the atmosphere, the entire setup of the restaurant, the food, and the service
they were only serving beer and wine because the bartender didn't show up that night
and one last thing, whoever thinks this is a romantic place is an idiot
We were here on 6/18 and found the fish to be incredibly fresh and well prepared
The rolls contained large pieces of fresh fish and a perfectly thin layer of rice
We even remarked that it was probably the best sushi we have had in years and we eat it at least once a week
We really enjoyed the house special roll
Service was friendly yet not overbearing
After reading all the reviews on Fusia I had to go and try it myself
I went there with my friends on 06/14/2005 and we were all highly dissappointed
Between 3 people, we ordered 4 appetizers, 3 rolls, the sashimi platter, and 10 individual pices of sushi so we had enough food to taste and sample to come to the conclusion that the food isn't as good as everyone claims
The Monkey Mountain and Jalepeno Yellowtail appetizers were ok, but the 5 Flavor Sashimi and Spicy Tempura appetizers were gross
The sashimi wasn't fresh and had a fishy taste to it and the tempura appeared to be mashed up salmon and who knows what else fried up
The rolls, sashimi platter sushi were just as bad
slimy, chewy fish
And the drinks were watered down and warm
Not worth the time and money at all
Fabulous Japanese-fusion foods
The monkey mountain warm sushi roll and banana spring roll warm dessert were INVENTIVE and HEAVENLY!! The sashimi was the freshest and choiciest cuts we've ever had
We ended up paying $80 for 1 glass of wine, 1 appetizer, 1 omakase entree, 1 hot entree, and 2 desserts
Everything was just delicious!
This place is definately a hidden gem
The food is outstanding especially the Monkey Mountain, toro tartar(pricey but worth it if your a fan), and the Chipolte shrimp roll
Drinks are great and prices are even better
I would highly recomend this place to any and everyone who is interested in Asian fusian
This place is a little small, but it is certainly a gem
The creations that they come up with are absolutely top of the line in the asian-fusion scene and the prices can not be reckoned with
No sign in front
I like those places
The large facial image of a beautiful gal imbedded in the glass door also lured me in
Met the manager, Mr
Danny, a formal Asian gent who recommended certain sushi plates and cooked Japanese appetizers
I damn near fell over from the exquisite presentation and subtle/stupendous taste
When I remarked on these, I was then shown letters from well known people who wrote of how Fusia competed with the best sushi worldwide
I haven't had it outside of the states, but each bite brought an eye closing, sighing reaction
This place is real find, as evidenced by this review by someone who never bothers to write reviews for places I enjoy
Fusia was special
I live in Northern Westchester and I really wish I live next door to Fusia! After a family friend recommended it to us we just can't stop thinking about the most exquisite foods we had that first time
They are fabulous both in taste presenations(so chic)!!! It's makes me feel chic just to be seen dinning in this place!! It's also one of the most romantic places we have ever been to, I want to be there every night, with the prices they charge we just might!! I love this place!! My husband couldn't stop talking about it neither!!
We came here because we heard that the chef formerly worked at nobu
We wanted to eat at place with nobu quality, but without the high costs
We ordered the omakase and the chef was willing to reveal what he was going to include in his omakase, unlike other restaurants, which like to play hide the ball
Although we had to wait awhile for our food, we were treated to complimentary edaname and miso soup
Our omakase was worth the wait
The arrangement of the fish was on ice cubes in a big bowl
The sashimi pieces were very fresh and there was plenty of it
Sometimes, sashimi can be overwhelming, but the arrangement here was just right
Also there were some original pieces in there
Next, came the nigiri pieces, which were equally fresh and innovative
This was all for $60 per person
2nd Avenue needed this spot! A cute, modern sushi restaurant with a full menu

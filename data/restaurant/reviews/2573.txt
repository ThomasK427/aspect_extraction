Honestly, the food was horrible
(I'm southeast asian, in case you don't think i'm qualified to judge!) We got the pad thai pre-fixe dinner
The pad thai we got was extremely baaaaaaaaaaaad; it was salty and the portion was small
It would be a decent deal if the food were not so horrid
The appetizer portions are extremely small
The only good thing about our meal was the coconut chicken soup
The service was also below par; the waiter actually spilled a dish on the customer sitting next to us
The decor is cheesy, especially the t

screen showing cockfighting
This is a classic Thai on 9th Ave

The service is quick and friendly
The food is unbelievable cheap!!!
Great food, great service, not expensive
Would definitely be back
This restaurant has excellent Thai food
They are quick, friendly, and attentive
The food is an excellent value, I highly recommend their lunch specials
The atmosphere isn't all that great, but you can afford to eat every meal here
The excellent food and drinks were very reasonably priced
I was very surprised by the prices and what a meal!?
The best Thai food I ever had!!! The staffs are very friendly, food is yummy and cheap!!
It's a place where you can go back there everyday for food
The person that gave this place a low rating must not know their thai food, because this place has some of the best dishes and spiced wonderfully! Try the coconut chicken soup for a taste treat! Prices are excellent and the service is quick and very efficient! You can't get much better than Yum Yum Bangkok
try it and see!
Took a couple of girls there - They all loved it!  The owners are very nice, and price is quite low
The food is very home made genuine
I had my wedding meal there (we had our first date there and eat there often) and it couldn't have been better
The owners are the sweetest people around and if you have a larger party there is a little known third floor which can be your private party room!  Delicious as always, very resonable, and charm, charm, charm!
Charming place with a very nice menu and a very good deal especially for theatre area dining
An OK pre-theater dinner experience
Great service! Average food, but large quantities and very low prices
This quaint but well-run Restaurant Row institution is perfect for a pre-theater meal
The menu is small but diverse, the service is top-notch, and the food is always good
Nothing out of the ordinary here, just delicious comfort in a nicer than average setting
We needed something quick and cheap to eat before our show started
We picked this for the novelty, but really enjoyed it
The food was surprisingly better than we expected -- very fresh, lots of veggies (good for the vegetarians like me!) and even though it was Saturday Night at 7pm, they weren't really croweded, so we didn't even get a time limit, though we were in and out in 45 minutes
We ordered off the prixe fixe menu -- salads and entrees for 12
95
Service was very friendly too
Highly recommend
You almost can't go wrong on Ninth Avenue in my book
it's my favorite place to wander read menus to make that all-important dinner decision
That said, we are upstaters whose international dining choices are relegated to standard Indian, Thai, Greek, etc
Trips to Manhattan provide a great opportunity to eat around the world
We went here on the strength of a citisearch 8
9 rating and are happy to report that 3 fairly discerning eaters deemed it a 10!   We shared 3 appetizers among us -- pancake, spring rolls, fried tofu -- that we all loved
Two of us chose barbecued meat on sticks, one did a vegeterian noodle dish
again, 3 different thumbs-up
Finally, 2 different desserts -- cinnamon layer cake and coconut custard -- and plenty of flavorful jasmine tea completed our experience
The wait staff was more than accommodating
the value was fantastic
we could not have been more pleased!
If you like food to be carefully prepared, delectable with subtle and complex flavors; if you like your cucumbers elegantly sliced rather than coarsely chopped into giant chunks; if you like flavors that pay tribute to the uniquely original flavors of Indonesia, then DO NOT come to this place! Bali Nusa Indah is the Indonesian equivalent of cheap Chinese take-out
It's completely inauthentic, the food is inferior, and the chef doesn't pay any attention to subtleties of flavor
The Pempek Palambang I had was so atrocious that I almost sent it back, and the beef Rendang Daging tasted about as Indonesian as backyard barbeque
If you want excellently prepared, delicious, AUTHENTIC Indonesian cuisine go to Borobudur located on 4th St
between 1st 2nd Avenue
I will never go back to this place again!
A friendly, little neighborhood place, Bali Nusa is low on atmosphere but BIG on food
The flavours are awesome, the staff cheerful and welcoming and the prices are pretty decent for the quantities of food that appear at your table
My favorite thing to do is go in there and order up a roti canai, java wings and a bakmi goreng
they do a pretty decent rendang pedang as well! Ooooh, I feel a craving coming on!
I went here with a group of 10 co-workers for a 12pm lunch
From the other reviews I was expecting to see a hole in the wall, but it was very clean, decorated with Indonesian artifacts and played soothing native music
We got served right away, waiters were attentive but not hovering over us
First they brought out fried tofu with a dipping sauce which was very good
Then we ordered a little bit of everything from chicken to shrimp to red snapper (i think) and each piece of meat was delicious fresh tasting, some of the sauces were spicy but not too bad
All their desserts focus on bananas and mango ice cream  The food is very affordable, place never got crowded consider we left at 2pm, I'm assuming it gets busier at night
So if you're looking for a cheap, BUT GOOD restaurant then you must visit
It doesn't look like anything spl but the food and the value more than make up for it
I had the complete dinner for $18
Includes a salad and a big entree (meat or vegan) with multiple side dishes, beer or wine and desert
The food was fantastic, sort of a cross btwn Thai and Indian
Maybe one of the best deals in the city
If you don't care about ambience and want some great eats for $21 total this place rocks!
Simply an excellent Indonesian restaurant with reasonable prices
Don't be put off by the simple decor, the food is every bit as good as the best Indonesian Restaurants in Amsterdam
Service has always been unobtrusive but excellent and I've eaten here many times
Go for the Nasi Rames or the mixed specials to sample a range of their excellent dishes
One of my favorite restaurants in NYC and one I always bring visitors to!!
After trying most Malaysian restaurants in Manhattann and NJ, I thought I'd give Indonesian a try, after all I am one and am tired of my own cooking
Although the service was friendly, NOTHING was worth the trip and money
We ordered Fish in chili sauce, pepes tahu, chicken singgang, es teler, es cendol, sarikayo, sup buntut, and roti canai
It was a lot of food for two, but what the hell, thought we'd give it all a try before passing judgements
If you're familiar with Indonesian food, you'd know that most of the dishes mentioned above are supposed to be spicy
But all we could taste was sweetness, with no spice kick let alone chili heat
Boy I was so disappointed!!! Sorry
I won't be a regular
better off at Jaya in Chinatown or Penang in Prince St
This restaurant is below our apartment, but it took us a while to try it due to the dilapidated decor and scowls from the staff
We finally tasted a morsel at the Intl
street festival and decided to give it a try
I'm glad we did
The food is great (especially for vegetarians), but the service is horrendous
We've had the vegetarian special each time we've eaten there and I'm a huge fan
The corn fritters are especially good
But, I would never suggest taking a date there or going for a night out on the town

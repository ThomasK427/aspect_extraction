We are ex-NYers, now living in CA and we were in the city and took a nostalgic trip to the lower East Side
Yonah Schimmel has always been the best knishes and still is
The review that found the people offensive were mistaken
While we there, we had a lovely chat with the owners about life in NY, how things have changed and we talked about how they came from Russia, etc, etc
They couldn't have been more pleasant
And I also used their facilities (that part is not so pleasant :))
Yonah Schimmel's is a New York icon
The knishes have remained consistent and true to their old world recipe despite today's widespread usage of unnatural ingredients
It is a wholesome delicious treat that everyone should enjoy at least once
But I warn you, once you try it, you'll be hooked
A great little hole in the wall bakery on Houston just a few blocks west of Katz's
After a sandwich at Katz's, stop off here on the way back to the subway and get a knish
None better anywhere
Guaranteed
Get it to go warm too
Many choice of fillings including spinach, red cabbage, and even fruit fillings like cinammon apple or walnut raison
Enjoy!
Wow! I was passing by and had to stop in
Delish knish and great service
She treated me very nicely
Now I found a new favorite place to nosh
How the reviewers say this place isnt recommended is beyond me
The knishes are the best I have ever tasted
Bursting with fresh potato and the additional veggies, these knishes are full of flavor, and barely need the addition of mustard
The sweet potato version is a tasty dessert, big enough to share between 2 or even 3 people, and at around $2, it's one of the best values around, and a healthy one, to boot!
It's a counterspace with tables, not remodeled since the 30s
Service is gruff, but efficient
Food is very, very good
You haven't had a Knish if you haven't had Yonah Schimmel's
I walked into Yonah Shimmel's with two friends
Our ages range from 60 to 70 and we were reasonably dressed
As we were looking at the menu inside, I asked if there was a bathroom available for customers
The answer was, Yes
Fine
No problem
I asked if they had foods without onions because of a sensitivity
The woman I asked started muttering, said I was asking too many question, and told us to leave
Leaving, I asked if the owner knew how she talked to customers
As we stood outside flabbergasted by this, a man came out and told us to go away, and never come back
He threatened to call the police
I can't really tell you about the food, but this experience needed to be shared
In Short Streits, the Lower East Side's last remaining matzo factory, has been keeping it kosher since 1925
In this no-frills store, you'll find matzos baked at the adjoining factory and a wide array of products for Passover
The metal shelves are laden with kichel, lollycones, novelty matzo and kosher cake mixes
Interested in how the flatbreads are made? Call ahead for a tour
If you celebrate passover you'll love Aaron streit's chocolate matzo it's really good the best dipped dark chocolte matzo ever even milk chocolate matzo
This is one of the best and most original restaurants in New York
It's been run by four generations of the same family, and it's obvious that a master is in the kitchen, crafting fresh, delicious takes on old stand-bys
Sounds like a couple of reviewers are more used to the gluey, oily Chinese you can get for a song all over the city, and more power to 'em
When I have the dough, I head for Canton
Never have I been so disappointed than my meal at Canton where expectations going in were very high
Considering that the food was extremely average, the portions small, and the menu small, the final bill for four of $180 made me feel as if I were held up at gunpoint
Save your money!
A family affair, celebration turned sour
How this resturant got its good rating from critics are very mind disturbing
The manager claims that they have the best Chinese food in town, only if you willing to paid more than 100 dollars for two lobsters
There are no price listed in the menu, and she will not provid them with a smile
She says she will take care of you
Yes, indeed all that cash only will rob you blind
Beware the hungry wolf
My family and I have been visiting Eileen and her family (Larry, Jeff, et
al) for years at Canton on Division Street
Forget about the menus, let Eileen's suggestions treat you to an incredible night of eating
Unlike the other restaurants that get the hype, this small restaurant relies on word of mouth instead of a marketing/pr team to hype it up
After you have a meal here, you will see why it has been named as one of the best Chinese restaurants in NYC for many years, strictly on its own merits
Good pho, Great prices
Hearty meals for under 10$ a head
nuff said
4 words: whole in a wall If you can overlook the decor, you can taste the same pho you get in Vietnam! It's small, compare to the other commercial driven vietnamese restaurants like Nah Trang, but this place is all about authenticity
I came back from Saigon and this is the only place I go when the craving comes back, despite a little farther walk from the subways
Don't forget to get the salty plum water too!
The service is incredibly disappointing
They are not bothered to answer very simple questions (e
g
regarding portion sizes), in both Cantonese or English
They rudely shoved my credit card back at me without explanation when I paid
When I queried them about it, they said I have to pay $2 extra to use it
The Japanese food is a shame
It is too expensive for poor quality
$13 for slices of old salmon sashimi on white rice
Without any accompanied starters like miso soup or small salad
The vegetable tempura (7 pieces for $5
85) was disgusting! They were tiny, shrivelled up, and the batter was not the correct recipe
The broccoli was literally burnt into pieces of brown charcoal
They didn't provide tempura dipping sauce
All they had was soy sauce
They shrugged when I asked about it, I consumed it anyways
I will _never_ go back there again
Place is a small, clean environment with an extensive menu
Extremely cheap breakfast special before 11:00 A

As a family-owned-and-operated restaurant it has a combination of exquisite food and impeccable service to create the perfect dining experience
Tien Garden consistently offers some of the best vegan fare in the city
The ingredients are fresh and the diner is given the option of baked or fried spring rolls, go for the baked! The crust is greaseless and crunchy
The place is small and more reminiscent of hole in the wall operations but the establishment is clean, spare, well kept
The owner is often on hand to guide one through the dishes, offering helpful recommendations
The waitstaff is very friendly and also well versed in the dishes
Great value for the money
The Dimsum is delicious
The shui mai and ha guo was very flavorful

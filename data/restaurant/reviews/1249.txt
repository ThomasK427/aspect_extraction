They were playing jazz all the time we were there
The food excellant, had the Sushi and the Gambas (shrimp), fab!!!! I will be back with girls, hopefully they will have the 3rd floor open soon, it looks hot! This may be the next Hot spot to go to
It is located by one of the greatest views of the Brooklyn Bridge
I was pleased to find it
I had a great time with my friends, we were lucky to get there on friday night during there half price drinks
We order some tapas and drinks by the lid bar and stood all night
We had great time! LOved it!
This is new and wonderful to Old fulton Street Landing
As a neighbor and a customer I can say it has a wonderful Ambience
The food is highly recommended, the lid bar and third floor adds to the ambince
The service needs to improve, but it is average
Very inexpensive for the area
Toro is in an interesting neighborhood in a building that used to be a bank when the brooklyn Bridge was build
The space itself is nice they could have done better
The food and prices were average but small
We didnt have sushi
The service was horrible
We were seated promptly but although place was empty it took about 20 minutes to get us menus
20 minutes later they came with 2 glasses of water and 1 bread basket for 15 people
10 min later we got more water and bread
We ordered drinks and food at the same time
And most of us got the food and drinks at the same time about 45 minutes after ordering
Go elsewhere!!
One of the worst experiences in my life
To make a long story short, I knew there was a problem when the waiter took my drink order
After ordering my main course, the waiter returns 5 minutes later telling me there was a problem with my order and what exactly did I order
Now, I was part of a big group and the appetizers we ordered was fine, (sushi boat, little sausages, salad) but when the food came out, both paella dishes were undercooked, my food (steak) did not even show up
After complaining about the wait, the waiter was confused as if I never ordered the steak
By the time the food came, I had no interest in eating it
HORRIBLE SERVICE
I couldn't even say what the food tastes like since I had none
I went home to eat Chef Boyardee
Need I say more
It was a great experience in a beautiful place
Sake flights were a good value and were very tasty
Dinner came before appetizers, which is a mistake, but forgivable
Maki combo for two was decent, but only the size of a single person's combo at a typical restaurant
Also, it was both maki and nigiri, not just maki
Ceviche was disgusting--just poor quality tuna sashimi with some chopped cilantro, not marinated in anything, much less any citrus juices
Also, an extremely tiny portion
Mushroom appetizer was doused in a gross mayonnaise like sauce and had not been described that way on the menu
Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff, but that was the fault of the inaccurate menu
The space of the restaurant was really nice, but they need a new chef and to reprint the menu
I STUMBLED ON TORO WHILE WALKING TO PICK ON MY WIFE
I PEAKED IN SIDE AND COULD NOT BELIEVED THE INSIDE OF TORO, I THOUGHT I WAS IN DISNEY
I DECIDED TO TRY THE PLACE OUT WITH MY WIFE AND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE, THE FOOD, SERVICE WAS SECOND TO NONE
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MIXTO, WHICH WAS MOROCCAN OCTOPUS, SEA SCALLOPS, AHD GULF SHRIMP WITH PIC DE GALLO
FOR DESERT I HAD THE DELIICIA DE CHOCOLATE , WHICH I COULD HONESTLY SAY WAS SO AWSOME, THAT I ACTUALLY TOOK 2 MORE TO GO
THE WAITRESS WAS SWEET AND THE WHOLE EXPERENCE LEFT US SMILING, I PROMISE TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD MAKE A POINT OF IT , THAT AT ANYTIME IM IN BROOKLYN, THAT TORO WILL BE ON MY LIST OF PLACES TO GO
Great food, Great location, Wonderfull Staff all inside a historic building that was transformed into a restaurant, bar and lounge
A must go to if you are in New York! This is an example of how New York City is a great city
This Historic location is a dream that turned into a reality for Mars and Tom the owners
Mars who is Spanish and Tom who is Asian made this location into a fusion of both worlds
Sushi with Tapas, Sanqria with sake and all other sort of great dishs
This is a must if your out for a good time!
IVE BEEN EATING SUSHI NOW FOR 10 YRS AND NEVER HAD SUSHI LIKE THIS BEFORE
THE SAKE SUSHI AND IKURA WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD, AND IT PRACTICALLY MELTED IN YOUR MOUTH
THERE IS OVER 10 KINDS OF SAKE, ON MENU WE CHOSE THE KAMOIZUMI WHICH I THINK I MAY HAD HAD TO MANY
IF ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR A AUTHENTIC MENU OF SUSHI AND SAKE, TORO IS THE PLACE TO DINE AT
Dish after dish of superbly prepared food, simply presented but boasting top-notch ingredients, finely tuned seasoning and consistency of standards
We started with appetizers ,toasted bread with skewers of shrimp and a incredibly awesome beef skewers with a lack of greasiness
Pia was probably my favorite, generous pieces of tender and smoky grilled squid, mussels, clams and shrimp on a bed of risotto rice  Spanish   our super-friendly waitress was helpful in explaining the dishes and knowledgeable about the ingredients and preparation methods
The wine list has an excellent range of internationally sourced bottles, with a impressive range of Spanish wines  Toro now ranks as one of my favorite eateries in new york city
I was really impressed with this new restaurant in DUMBO
The building is historic and beautiful
We stopped in for a drink at the bar and was very impressed with the place
Will be back to try the food
Our concierge at the Westin recommended this restaurant as a pre-theatre option over the Easter holiday
He indicated it would work for our family of 4
The atmosphere was modern and sophisticated and we were seated right away; however service soon declined as we were treated like the plague by both the staff and other patrons simply because we had our children with us
Four tables seated after us were waited on and served before us
My two children, ages 10 and 6 were well behaved and very patient, but my husband and I felt we were irritating people simply because we were dining there with our family
It was a shame really
We pride ourselves on our children experiencing new things and knowing how to behave respectfully at special places, but we were not treated well that night
overall a fine experience
The service was a bit obtrusive, but only as they were truly trying to please
We we seated immediately on a non-busy night
The wine list was decent but not outstanding by the glass
The octupus carpaccio special was beautiful to look at,but lacked a bit of taste
The Speck in the salad appetizer was flavorful and a reaonable portion
All the sizes were not huge, but clearly enough
The ravioli with lamb,ammaretto and raisons among other things was the standout at the table, an unusual taste, but very good
I was happy I went and so were our friends, worth a special trip across town, plus/minus
We first found the restaurant by accident and just had drinks, but really fell in love with the atmosphere, service, and location
We've been back numerous times and enjoy it every time
An extremely enjoyable evening
Our party of four was warmly and promptly welcomed by Brian and the waiting staff went above and beyond normal expectations to ensure a plesant experience without being fussy
I will absolutely visit this restaurant again on my next trip
I would definitely recommend this restaurant
My sister and I took my mother there for an early dinner on Mother's Day after the theatre
I had no expectations whatsoever
We all three loved it
Very cool yet warm ambience, great food (hangar steak and goat especially, but the prix-fixe chicken was also excellent, as were the artichoke appetizer and lentil soup), and charming, attentive service
I had my second dining experience at Etcetera Etcetera this past weekend
Having discovered this gem earlier this year, I was looking foward to a return visit
This place has definitely found its groove and is a bright sexy addition to the area
The staff [Joe, Jeff, Isabella and Brian] is awesome and fun to be around
The menu is inventive and a welcome departure from the ordinary
I highly recommed this restaurant if you are in the area [close to the theatre district and times square]
I certainly plan to return again

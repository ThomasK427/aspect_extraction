prices are O
K
service is knowledgable and friendly
Nighty specials are a good value
Even has a tiny bar in the corner where regulars stop just to say hi
The Scene This is as close as you can get to eating at someone's home and still have to pay at the end
The storefront space is far from glamorous, but chef Mara and her staff make diners exceedingly welcome
They are the heart of the restaurant, doting on the customers and offering endless advice, accommodation and conversation
The Food The menu consists of Southern comfort-food favorites as well as spicy Louisiana specialties
Meat loaf with rosemary-garlic mashed potatoes is a slice of home, with the perfect texture and loads of flavor
The rich, delicious hot artichoke dip tastes of nostalgia, and breaded fried pickles wake the palate like nothing else
As when eating at someone's home, not everything is always right: Catfish is over-smothered in a salty sauce, and chicken-fried steak is lifeless, but the majority is very good
Hot beignets and bourbon-rich pecan pie are both favorites
This restaurant sent email messages to its customers every 3-4 days from 6/28 to 7/17 exhorting them to keep voting DAILY on Citysearchvote on EACH computer, ONCE a day in the barbecue category
So is it any surprise that they are at the top of the category over better restaurants? Their willingness to game this system it makes you wonder about the 75 reviews
If a bad review sinks their overall rating, well, theres a simple solution to floating it
I have had good food there, although ironically the barbecue in particular was lackluster
They are way off their price point though for their style of enterprise
If I want to pay $7 for a slice of pie or $9 for a spiked cider (with an indiscernible spike by the way) I can do it in a nicer place
the food was DRY
The gator bites were DELICIOUS and so were the crab fingers
But every entree that consisted of their meats were dry
I'd go again for their appetizers but not their entrees
The hurricanes are killer! The nite I went w/a friend they were out of the crab! we made gluttons of ourselves on gator bits, fried pickles and fried green tomaters
YUM!! the bits were a bit tough tho'
The BBQ platters were enuf for at least 2 or 3 people to share
I bought enuf home to have for breakfast the next morning w/ my daughter
She's hooked on the ribs!  We will be back
for the chocolate pecan cake
The food was BAD!!!! the service was nice but the food was horrible
i was really disappointed because ive heard such great things about this place
The black peppered shrimp tasted like oily and not a hint of black pepper
The seafood gumbo was mostly onions and not enough seafood
i would not not recommended!!!!!!!
I took my two kids and a friend to Mara's and we had a fantastic meal
I started off with a few Perfect Lemonades, on the owner's recommendation
Our meal included etoufee, fried okra, fresh Lousiana BBQ Shrimp, and the tastiest BBQ I've ever had! The mayo free coleslaw is not to be missed
I even got a pint to take home with me! My husband particularly enjoyed the leftovers I brought home
He loved the Arkansas BBQ sauce and ribs that melt in your mouth
I highly recommend this restaurant
The food is amazing and the owners are passionate about their cooking
Desserts all looked so good that we couldn't just order one
We shared Red Velvet Cake, Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Cake that were to die for! Bring friends!
You can't get any better than this!!! We go down to New Orleans every year, and have to eat at Mara's to get our southern fix of great food every few months!!!
I've eaten at Mara's with real bbq fanatics and we all agree that the beef ribs are the best in the city and can stand up to the best Texas has to offer
Topping it off are some of the most fabulous homemade desserts, which brought many to Mara's in the first place (she made her reputation at the now-defunct Java Jazz)
Picture being in the kitchen of a Southern Yenta not the exactly the best place for a romantic dinner for two
The friendly service from the owners and their daughter give it a nice warm feel , like being in someones kitchen
The food rocks
Spicy enough to add to the flavor without burning the mouth
The ribs are meaty and by far the best crawfish in New York
Definitely try the gator bites
THE BARBECUE IS THE BEST -JUST THE RIGHT SMOKING AND SAUCES FRIENDLY SERVICE AND BUSY SO CALL FOR RESERVATIONS - THEY ALSO HAVE GREAT COMFORT FOOD AND CAJUN - NEW ORLEANS STYLE
Mara's has a refreshingly relaxed vibe, which is great when eating a bucket of crawfish (spicy!)
I also had the best softshell crab sandwich i've ever had
This place made me feel as if i was leaving in new orleans again
Great owners and host! I was born and raised in NYC and this place is the best kept secret here!
keep it up!
The gator bites are covered with flour, and reheated by microwave, and served with a oily mayonaisse dip
The jambalaya trio is mainly rice and beans, with some shredded chicken and a few sausages
The appetizer and entree cost $30 bucks--what a ripoff
I should have gone to the Mexican place around the corner and gotten beans and rice
It would have tasted better and been a whole lot cheaper
If you want to continue your business, don't serve reheated food--it should be freshly cooked, especially at these prices
would go back anytime I want a relaxed, delicious meal
This place is a ripp-off
my girlfriend I ordered an appetizer special which turned out to be about 5 little pieces of old sausage and we were charged $8
95 for it; a pint of beer is $7
00; My girlfriend had a glass of ice with sangria for $8
00
I had the st
louis ribs for $22
00, which turned out to be mostly fat and ligament - my girlfriend had the VERY DRY pulled pork
The meats were poor quality, probably prepared days earlier and microwaved to heat up - also the rubs on the ribs - this was not a visit to memphis! Not recommended
and if you want to go, you will surely feel like you've been robbed after you've paid for your dinner! Restaurants like this give the East Village a bad name
I came to this restaurant with a few friends of mine who are from the South and I felt like I was welcomed in with open arms
The couple that owns the restaurant, Mara and Dave, were extremely willing to make accomodations for my group of five by moving a few tables around
Once seated Dave actually sat down with us and made us feel like we were part of the family
He made some great recommendations for starters which included some of the freshest and spiciest Crawfish my mouth had ever tased
The Hurricanes were abosultely amazing, but watch out because they can creep up on you
All in all it was a great experience and I would highly recommend it for a night where you wanted to spice things up
I have never taken the time to rate ANYTHING on city search, but Mara's Homemade completely deserves the praise! We started going to the restaurant early this fall, and my friends and I now visit at LEAST once a week
The Hurricanes are a must- as well as the Rib Combo
We have enjoyed the biggest oysters in the city, as well as the crawfish all spring and are VERY excited for the the first shipment of crabs this summer! I would make reservations though- the word has certianly gotten out!
I brought some friends to Mara's in mid March
The place was not busy
The food was probably o
k
, but served luke warm after a very, very long wait
We dare not return the dishes because we were starved
Then Mara's husband bark at us because we wanted a little time to look over the bill
He became so nasty as we tried to calculate the various charges that we couldn't do anything else but just pay and leave
When we got home and had some peace and quiet, we then found the reason why Mara's husband was so nervous
We were over charged $50
00 on the food portion of the bill and over 25% for the waiter
Mara's Homemade is small and very unprofessional
We do not recommend it at all
Had an OK dinner that was made better by the attention the owners pay to the patrons
Maras has the best Key Lime pie I've ever tasted
Came back for brunch a few weeks later had the worst dining experience I've ever had in NYC ( I've lived here for 42 years!)

We enjoyed everything!! Brunch was lovely, the sun did come out and the kids were invited to play in the garden
we will return and recommend this kid friendly place to other couples
I made the mistake of reading all the CitySearch reviews and taking a date here
First off, the out door area is average, nothing out of the ordinary for small-space outdoor dining
Looks very similar to those restaurants in Little Italy, but WOW!
I would have rather ate at one of those places by far
and any NYC native knows that's not where you find good Italian
The apps took 45 min, then the gnocci entree consisted of 4 tiny balls(pasta) of complete mush
Lets just say my date was NOT impressed, and it definitely was a bad start to the night we could have done without
Never again!
we first discovered va tutto last fall when we attended a wedding there - a great event, just lovely,the food,the ambience and the care taken by the staff
since we have returned to dine several times and each time it seems to get better ! last night's meals, with a few new items on the menu,were really tasty;salads,perfectly done fish and a ravioli dish that was quite a treat,lemon ricotta,i think
having shown up without reservations we did have to wait a bit for a table,but we knew it would be worth it
can't wait for the garden to open
The owners were able to recreate a sort/of Tuscan atmosphere w/a nice garden/pretty flowers
BUT this is a restaurant-Why do people go to restaurants?To eat!After offered breadwater arriving 25min later-3 pieces of hard bread w/focaccia-(kind you buy at the supermarket),which they forgot to pop in the oven(dosen't come fully cooked)
Then I ordered a margarita,rocks w/salt, the waitress' replied:I don't think we have salt What do you cook your food with?!She finally found salt and served chilled MargaritaMix in/a martini gls,no tequila
MAINCOURSE-Monkfish(was it really monkfish
?)w/steamed spinach and roasted potatoes
1st, the fish was way too thick fishy tasting to be monkfish(normally mild in taste)2nd, the potatoes were cold crumbling in my mouth like a piece of cork
($18) I understand it was busy,but if you're in the restaurant business,you should be prepared for that
For all the positive editorial reviews listed,they MUST have connections in the Industry

Went here last night for g/f b-day and the food was stellar
Loved the Canneloni and g/f had the pesto penne
Outstanding food and yes the portions were of a decent size
The salads were OK, bread was awesome and dessert was a average as well
Stick w/ the entrees and enjoy
The food is very good
Outdoor garden is a nice touch as well
Our server didnt introduce herself (do staff in NYC do this at all) until i asked what her name was
Seems like the norm for NYC service though
I'd reccomend fora nice date or special night w/ the lady
Be prepared to wait as we weren't seated until 8:40 PM for an 8 PM reservation
I'll be back to sample more pasta dishes
Fine, fine food
I've been a number of times now, and have tried (or stolen from my dinner companions) a lot of things on the menu
Not a single one has been less than excellent, especially at the price point -- the pasta dishes are the best
Flashier, pricier Italian restaurants can be found, but why would you ever bother when there's Va Tutto!? They deserve a gold star
what a find in nolita - that's NO little italy ! lovely,warm dining room
Fresh, authentic and delicious food
We went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend,and were we pleasantly surprised
great wine list,well priced,great selection of music,helpful,professional staff
what more ? looking forward to dining in their garden soon !
From the moment we arrived at Va Tutto, we knew this was going to be an enjoyable dining experience
We were greeted warmly by the hostess, and immediately shown to our table
Fresh bread and olive oil were promptly served
The Wait Staff performed seamlessly, and made us feel at home
The best part was yet to come
Our food was extremely delicious
Each of us ordered something different, and were impressed with the quality, portion, and taste
We noted that, through the evening, the Wait Staff did not rush us, yet our needs were attended to in an unobtrusive manner, which is what we were looking for, and found with Va Tutto
Overall, the food had a home made taste that was also evident in the aroma that waifed through the air around our table
We definitely plan on revisiting Va Tutto to sample more of their delicious menu
My girlfriend and I went on New Year's Eve (there was a delicious looking prix fixe menu but we choose the a la carte one) and enjoyed an exceptional meal and great service
My braised lamb shank reminded me very much of osso buco, but with lamb rather than veal, and it was phenomenal
The Piatto vaTutto is a perfect appetizer, full of typical antipasto offerings, and the tiramisu is the second best I've ever had (mom gets first)
Our waitress recommended an inexpensive bottle of Sicilian wine that turned out to be perfect for our meal, which I'd give a 10 out of 10 overall
I am a really picky eater, been to almost all of the restaurants in Little Italy
Ane this one is so much better than those rip off restaurants there! Also been to Spring St Natural, and the one rite next to Va tutoo (forgot the name)
Good portion, phenomenal quality, and the really comforting waiters, quiet and classic atmoshphere, I must say this is one of my few fav restaurants in NYC which is very underrated
:D
an all-round excellent dining experience
a warm,charming and beautiful room
delicious dishes obviously prepared with  the freshest ingredients and a lot of love
the best calimari i've ever had,a wonderful selection of salads,and seafoods prepared to delicate perfection
and cheerful,attentive service as well
each time we go to va tutto ! it just gets better
we look forward to spring to be able to enjoy the great garden  dining out back
i wish this place was right around the corner  from home so we could eat there more often
The atmosphere is wonderful and intimate
The service is friendly and attentive without being intrusive
But the best thing on the menu is the gnocchi
It is the best I have ever had
It's so light and fluffy and incredibly cheesy
Yum! We also had a fish dish which was very good too
overall, this is a wonderful place to have an intimate, yet casual dinner
My wife and I have dined at Va Tutto on three occations and have had consistently excellent food and service
We love the garden
It's innovative italian food at it's best, with nice portions
If you are really hungry - this is not the place for you
Food is decent but portions are so tiny and the whole meal is served on huge plate which makes it look even more ridiculous
You are better off ordering several appetizers instead of the entre
My wife and I and her parents went to Va Tutto two nights ago and were extremely happy with the entire evening
It was the best Italian food we've had in the City
The portions were not huge, but very very tasty (pastas ranged from $12 - $15)
We had salad, pasta, wine, and dessert
The outdoor brick patio was pretty with all sorts of blooming flowers and plants
The wait staff were very nice and we were not rushed at all
I would highly recommend this restaurant
You won't get huge portions but thats not the point of eating out, right? Va Tutto will give you authentic Italian taste that you can truly savor!! Our order was screwed up a few times during one dinner but the waitstaff did everything they could to correct the errors
AND -- the outside garden in the back is fabulous and romantic
This makes for a perfect date restaurant!!! Enjoy

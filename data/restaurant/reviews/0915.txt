positives include the eggplant spread, brussel sprouts, and the potato agratin
the skirt steak was decent, but for another $5 i could've gotten a whole steak instead of a few slivers
the ambiance is lovely, w/an earth toned decor and candle light
the bar looked like the best place to be, a nice place for a drink without getting taken to the cleaners on below average food
there are a ton of great tapas places in the city so skip alta and head to places like PIPA and LA PAELLA
On a rainy weeknight, Alta was not crowded
Excellent decor, extensive wine list with some wines reasonably priced
Food is inventive and delicious but the tiny portion sizes are for birds or those who recently had their stomachs stapled
My date and I rang up an $85 tab with 4 tapas plates and one of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu and THEN had to go somewhere else to relieve our hunger
I agree with a previous poster - you enter hungry and come out hungrier! But I would return for the romantic ambience and the wine, the service is good too - if you're hungry you should find somewhere else to eat
I've been to Alta five times since they opened
Every time, the food, the staff and the atmosphere have been fantastic
They know their wine
It's a place where you can safely order from the bottom end of the wine price list and know that you will get a great bottle
Last time we went, we had the server pick our entire meal
Glad we did, otherwise I wouldn't know that brussel sprouts can taste so delicious
The wooden architecture and wrap around upper level make for a truly romantic evening
Although I wasn't blown away, I really enjoyed my evening at Alta
My favorites were the fried goat cheese, skirt steak and grilled asparagus
The Gnocchi and Choc Risotto for Dessert I could have done without
Bill for three with 7 plates, glass of sangria each and coffee and one dessert was 45 each with tip - not too bad but a tad overpriced for the serving size of the dishes
Great, great dining room though on such a cute block and friendly service
it's just that
it gets better and better
i've been here before and the new dishes are better than the last
this time i had the phyllo cheese twists and we ordered 2 more
the monkfish was all texture and pleasure
even the grape margarita was perfect which i was skeptical about
something is happening here more than i remember
only complaint is getting a second round is difficult
be vocal!
Certainly is different, which you notice when you walk into the main dining room
which is surrounded by balcony dining
Try get on the balcony, it's much better
It's American style tapas, which sounds odd
but turns out very good
The Tuna tartar with macadamian nuts was my favorite, sounds odd
but the combo of flavors was incredible
The skirt steak hit the mark as well
The one strike I have with this place is that the portions are very small, so order a lot
Service was the friendliest I've seen in NYC, no pressure at all
The ambience makes this a must go
small portions for 10 bucks a pop
not worth it if your really hungry
good only if you are looking for a nibble
try any of the following, you won't be disappointed: lamb meatballs, sunchoke risotto, seared fois gras, baked goat cheese
i've had lovely experiences both times i was here -- an extensive wine list, nice servers, warm atmosphere and decor all contributed to the evenings
a note to those who feel the cold easily, bring a sweater
they keep it chilly
Took a friend there to celebrate his birthday
Excellent meal
Waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes, friendly and efficient
Food is fairly priced
However, the evening ended up on a disappointing note - the restaurant only takes Amex and didn't tell us that
This is the first time I have been to a restaurant that takes credit cards, but neither Visa or Mastercard
Unfortunately, my friend had to pay for the meal, on his birthday
I came here with a group
The portions are very small, so the small price tag is a bit deceiving
We wound up paying a bit over $60 per person for dinner (with two drinks each) and I left hungry
The food tends to be quite good
Weve sampled a good dozen plates and havent found one that we didnt like
The wine list is daunting
We wound up settling on a $40 cabernet and it was very good
The wait staff was knowledgeable, and helpful
The decor is very pleasant and romantic
I probably won't be returning as I've found the place overpriced, but I am not sorry I came here
Very nice setting, service is very good, wine list is nice
Visting the city with a friend, we were very pleased with Alta
The menu was wonderfully diverse and the food was fresh tasting and skillfully made
This is not the place for anyone who prefers a conservative meal!
LOVE the food! The fried goat cheese balls with jasmine-infused honey were so great that when we took our first bites, both my friend and I stopped all conversation and put our hands to our hearts
Truly amazing! The wait staff is sometimes a bit uppidy, but the other patrons and the food make it well worth going back to again and again! An aside: I've noticed better service at the bar than the tables
The food was nearly average
Service was HORRIBLE
Our first order was lost and we found out about a half hour after the fact
After the second time ordering, we were given the wrong food and compensated with free drinks
When the bill came, these drinks were included in the food portion of the tab (i
e
, hidden - food added up to less than the subtotal)
The waiter didn't even apologize for the mistakes
SO MANY GREAT TAPAS PLACES IN NYC - DO NOT GO HERE!
Short but good beer list featuring beers from Belgium, Germany, France -- even an Ethiopian
The bar staff is professional, though busy, so you don't get doted on
That said, it's no challenge to order
The tapas were excellent
They arrived promptly, slightly staggered
We shared the lamb meatballs, zesty Spanish chicken wings, and fried goat cheese with lavender honey
Each was inventive, fresh, and elegant
The goat cheese paired particularly well with my Saison Dupont
I finished with a single malt, and my girlfriend had a bourbon
Generous pours
We didn't walk out stuffed, but satisfied that we'd eaten well
What really charmed us was the beautiful, warm ambiance
There was a fire crackling in the dining room, the bar was a finished copper, the stools were leather, and the lighting wasn't dim nor bright, but just
warm
I will return as soon and as often as possible
Maybe our worst wine experience ever in West Village
We tried seven wines from their menu (bottle and six individual glasses), trying to find a decent one
All but one were very poor, including the top of the range red by the glass which was almost undrinkable
Service was aso very weak

I know why it is thought to be the best fish restaurant in the city
I had tuna, shrimp ravioli and a salmon with a truffle butter sauce
The fish was very fresh and tasted amazing
The sauces and the way the fish was prepared made the meal
The warm chocolate tart is also the best dessert I have ever had and I have had a lot of desserts! It was to die for
The service was outstanding, the food was too
It is a very expensive restaurant and that is the only reason why I wn't be able to frequent it
eating here is not like eating anywhere else in the city
block out an entire evening for this true dining experience
you will feel like you are the only person the staff is waiting on, you will almost expect them to wipe the crumbs off your face
astronomical price, but this restaurant is clearly not for everyone
EVERYTHING about this place is impeccable unmatched
recommendation: the prix fixe menus
Definitely the best restaurant we have been in NY
Period
I went there for my sister's birthday and the experience was tremendous!The food and the service were absolutely excelent
Not only tasty, but also light and healthy
Some people think that the proportion are small, but you know what?It is definetely wrong, whatever they give you, it's the perfect proportion!!!It's a great place to go and it's worth every penny, I would definetely recommend it! Go and see for yourself!!!
We had a celebratory lunch here and every dish was well-prepared, nicely presented and the perfect size
I've read complaints about the small portions, but these are just perfect for having wine with the dishes and a dessert+coffee to top it all off
The SurfTurf (monkfish medallions and braised oxtail) was a perfect combination of flavors
The halibut was a bit bland
The yuzu lemon dessert was quite different and the chocolate one was a sweet sinful conconction
With its can't-miss wine list and cordial, attentive staff, Le Bernardin makes for a lovely meal
Setting is chic, but not romantic
Still, it's a good for a date, treating friends, meeting with a business associate or just treating yourself
I ate here at the beginning of the summer and it was superb
The service is outstanding and all of the dishes are light and flavorful
An unfergtful evening with a feast for your tastebuds
Upscale, romantic, impecable service and food
Romantic ambience, excellent seafood, world class servce and a wonderful wine list
Wonderful dinner served with class
Great choices for seafood and game
Had dinner there tonight it was better than I remembered
Excellent food service
Wonderful dining experience with classic French cuisine and great seafood
I had a wonderful experience in Le Bernardin
Eeverything was great
I love it, and you should go too
Good food, good service, and if you go with good company what more can you ask for? The service was impeccable, and it deserves its reputation for being the best fish restaurant in NYC
The bouillabaise really is the best I've had outside of Provence
Mainly a takeout place
I really like their chicken burritos, with that charbroiled taste, and quite filling
Their tacos are not bad for the price
Shrimp recommended
They just need to learn that you can't save guacamole
:)
Very good burgers (juicy, thoroughly-cooked, and sauteed in the vegetables of your choice)
However, even after acknowledging the midtown/central park south locale, their prices are a little steep ($13 for a salad?)
If you like the thick and meaty style of burger (as opposed to the '50's burger-stand style), come here for the best burger in its class
I happened upon this little sleeper of a diner one lunchtime, hungry for a burger
Nothing about appearance of the place tipped me off--I just got lucky
The burger arrived, big, thick and perfectly seared on the outside, with excellent fries on the side, and it was a good thing I was leaning over my plate when I bit into it, because otherwise my clothes would have been badly soiled from the flood of juice that poured out and filled my plate
This is Mall Pizza!!! I dont care how long its been in NYC this is not good ny pizza   Its packed with tourists who will never return anyway so the store can afford to sell this pizza and still be packed!  Crust was soggy, cheese congealed, and sauce nothing special
And to top it off its more expensive than most pizza in the city
If you are from out of town and want to try real ny pizza be sure to avoid this spot
This pizza did not live up to its advance billing or expectations
It was ok, but frankly no better than Dominos
The crust was neither crisp, nor chewey, the toppings were acceptable but not memorable, and the spicing was undistinguished
I could have done better at my neighborhood pizzeria in Portland, Oregon
I expected more in midtown Manhattan
the best slice I ever had
I look forward to going there whenever I go to N
Y
C
There is nothing as good in California
Calamari appetizer, fresh and fried perfectly
Flavorful porchini ravioli entre served in a light sauce, and a pleasant and helpful wait staff
Throughly enjoyable evening
I got Chicken Tikka Masala for take-out and it came in a pint-sized container with 6 pieces of meat
I also go the Mulliogatawny Soup and it too came in a pint-sized container
Neither were extremely flavorful compared to the rest of Indian food I've eaten in my life
The basmati rice was average
Hate to be mean but these guys would get repeat orders from me if they only added more meat to their dishes
Their meat dishes cost the same as other Indian deliveries but contain half the meat
Otherwise the food is tasty
Restaurant was recommended by the hotel Mayfair (excellent cheap hotel) on the same street
Service and ambience excellent
The salad and appetizer were great
The main course not so
My pasta was not quite cooked, much less al dente
My wife had a dish with calamari, mussels, shrimp and clams
The clams were the size of a fingernail, the mussels had a sewer taste
Wine was great thought
Caraffe of wine, appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees for $130 plus tip? Should be no complaints at all
We were going to Babbo but talked out of it
Never been to Babbo yet, wish we had nowl
My wife and I went there for lunch right around noon
The restaurant was not crowded, which was nice
We made the mistake of ordering the lunch pre-fixed menu
We both ordered the soup and the pasta with proscutto peas and a bottle of Chianti
They did not have the wine that we wanted, so we ordered Chianti by the glass
They were also out of the soup that came with the special, but they did substitute with another soup that was more expensive
The pasta dish came out with no proscutto and we had to send it back, but after that it was fine
I think it would have been better if we didnt order the special
Excellent ambience, Fabulous decor
Great food
This spot is a nice romantic , yet casual spot for pre-show dinner/drinks
Love it
and will definitely go back!

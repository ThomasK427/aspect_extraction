The staff was very good, we were seated quickly
I'd definately go back
On a recent friday evening my dinner date and I were impressed with the quality and presentation of our dinner selections
The service was curteous and prompt
The dining room quickly filled as the evening progressed
There was never any feeling of being rushed to fill another cover
We will be making reservations again
As a local its always good to find places to go, even in tourist traps like TSQ
First visit was pleasant enough, two subsequent visits
all bad
Service and attitude is horrendous
Sitting towards the front of the bar/restaurant could be a pleasaurable experience if the wait/bar staff did not so resent waiting those tables
On the last visit I was with a friend, there were SIX other individuals at approx
20 tables, after 5 minutes of waiting, we were asked to move to a two person table to make room for larger parties (we were at a four person table, then waited nearly 10 minutes with no return visit from the bartender
This is how ridiculous service is here
Otherwise, average at best
Will not recommend
Whether sampling the bar food or going for the whole sit-down experience St
Andrews is really a top notch eatery
The best scotch selection I've come across in this city and many a great, great beer to accompany them
The live music is always terrific and adds to an atmosphere that was almost perfect to begin with
The staff are knowledgeable and friendly; two things that are tough to come by in NYC these days(you know what I mean)
The scotch there is VERY pricey, but if you have a modecum of interest the like, price will not stop you
I could go on, but what for
?
Need I say more? The Scottish ale on tap is always tasty and fresh
Stick with that, some chips, and the watiers in kilts and you, lassie, are in for a great night!
Spent a week in September in NYC
Ate at St
Andrews and was very impressed
Although pricey, the food was incredible
I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in my life, but this is the only one I have ever loved this much
I had the Honey Thistle Chicken with mashed potatos and spinach
Could not praise it enough
Amazing
Will be returning in December after Christmas just to have dinner there again
Highly recommend!
Walking in finds the pub side of the place
Walk a little further and you'll find the dining section
I went on a Friday nite and the place was sparcely seated
The server was friendly and was available but not pushy
I had a special, a tuna steak with spinach and other veggies with red pepper sauce (yum) and my date had a NY Strip with mashed potatoes
It is a nice twist on simple foods while offering the basic appetizers (calamari, shrimp) and a pleasing selection of entrees, especially for me, since I'm a fish person
Not extravagant or fancy, but reasonably priced and a nice quiet place to eat some good food
Food and ribs are always good
This would be a great place with the exception that the service sucked
The nine little indians that run around with their surly attutudes have no idea what the concept of service is
Face it honey, you will be working here for the rest of your life, get used to it
Broadway hasn't called for a reason
Except the 18% gratuity automatically added in, and dont forget to appologize when asking for a condiment
you are interrupting a waitresses conversation
Heard so much about St
Andrews had to try it, it topped off my weekend of letdowns
Poor cuts of meat, quite fatty, not to mention horrible and unattentive waitstaff in dining
The bar however is another story, great celtic music, good crowd, bar staff were friendly
Go back for the bar
What a surprise! I walked past a huge bar W/ tons of beers whiskeys to find a welcoming dinning room in the back
The service was great - super friendly
I had the $27
95 price fix opting for salad, ribeye creme brulee ALL DELICIOUS! my friend went for the scallops, they were also delicious
Can't wait to go back
Scottish/golf themed restaurant serving honest to goodness Brit food
Solid service and food, pleasant antique inspired dining area and bustling atmosphere
I've been there at lunch and like it for that and for a feed of meat and potatoes
Came with a party of 4 for an early dinner on Sunday, Dec
29
I ordered the tuna steak
Sent it back the first time because it and the vegetables were cold
It came back on a new plate, still cold
Gave it back to the waitress and requested a shrimp cocktail as I hoped there was little chance they could do a poor job on that
I was wrong
My companions had the stuffed trout (very mediocre), scallops (good but not great) and the salmon (good)
Dessert was poor as well (crme brulee, apple crisp were just as tasteless as could be; but the cheese cake was very good) The coffee was barely warm
When I got the check, they had included the tuna steak I had sent back
It was removed when I brought it to their attention
There are many better options in the area
We had a group of seven, five between the ages of 26 and 19
All had a great time
The food was great, and the atmosphere was just cozy
We were really impressed with the collection of Scottish whiskeys and beer on tap
We enjoyed the honey chicken, steaks, tuna, and the seafood combination of clams, oysters, scallops, shrimp, etc
(paella like)
Everyone was thrilled with the restaurant choice I made
Walking distance to all the theaters, midtown, Times square
Excellent pub-fare with upscale pub atmosphere
Honored e-reservation with no problem, and sat us early (I have to admit I was a little weary)
This place is a really good time
Good service, knowledgeable staff
We dined there post-theater on Sat
11/16/02
For $27
95 each 2 in our group had a wondeful salmon, creme brulee, sorbet, tea, salad, and escarole soup special
The $16
95 ala carte Grilled Rib-eye was tasty as well
Nice decor, pleasant service, recommended
Thought this place was only a bar
Very good food and attentive service
They do a very good job in getting you out in plenty of time for a show
Would definitely go back
My baby back ribs were so tender

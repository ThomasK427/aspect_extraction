I like it spicy!
Like the other reviewers, we think this place is very good
The service is good, the fish is fresh and the prices are great
What strikes me as odd from all the other previous reviews is that no one has really mentioned all the more authentic and atypical assorments that they offer
Great selection of yakitori and they also might be the only place uptown (at least that I know of) that serves takoyaki! Of course I like the takoyaki from St
Marks better but for an uptown place, Tatany certainly satisfies without me having to travel far
Perhaps because I live only a few blocks from Tatany on 3rd Ave, I'm rarely there in person -- but often in spirit, because I order delivery about once a week
Quite a good value: the fish is always fresh and the rolls are well-stocked
(Try the picante roll -- japapeno and tuna, wonderful!)
The sushi and sashimi for 2 is a pretty good deal here for $50 different selections of sushi all on one big plate
The teriyaki yellow tail collar piece was good (dont remember what its called in japanese) worth ordering not dry like many other places
The only downside with my experiance here is that the fish didn't seem top quality fresh
Worth giving it a try though
Hope this helps!
A small, not too obvious restaurant, Tatany is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I have ever eaten in
If you love small, obscure, out-of-the way places, this is the place for you
The food, service and prices are teriffic
Simply a reliable place with one of the best Sushi Deluxe's in town
Solid quality and freshness
Warm, casual atmosphere
Can't beat this place if you're looking for some good nigiri/sashimi without the pretentious crowds and a dent in your wallet/pocketbook
Tatany serves the best Japanese food in the neighborhood, sans attitude and steep prices
You must have a slice of pizza from here
Not only is it the best thing we ate when visiting NYC, the nicest people we met were the employees at this place
We loved stopping by for lunch and dinner and visiting with them, on our way to and from sightseeing
We've sampled almost the whole menu and not only does it taste great, it's a great value
We will definitely choose a hotel close by for future trips
this place is right beside 3 other pizza places, i have eaten at them all
they have the BEST pizza by far
more cheese than any of the others
i walk past all the other places to get to this one
excellent
We ate here twice on our recent visit to NYC
The food was great
Children were welcome
Beautiful decor
Very clean
Friendly staff
Great prices
Best fried rice we ever had! We will be back!
We visited this famous Seinfeld appearing restaurant last week after its relocation and reopening; wow~~~~~~it was totally different from the old one i knew, would way, way better! The garden-front, the deco with green bamboo and Tibet Thangka, the soft light, the Japanese-style wood floor make the atmosphere so refresh and elegant! And they do offer Japanese food now! I highly recommend its Sushi combo; it was the first time I saw a sushi with such long fish meat, like one ribbon covering on rice, and delicious mushrooms in miso soup! My Japanese friend told me that kind of sushi style were only seen in fine restaurants in Japan, and it was also her first time to got it in New York! And above all, comparing with fine deco and food, the price was fair: we spent around $40 for sushi combo, one Chinese entry, sake, taxtips! Highly recommended!!!!
In Short Named for the Hudson River, this bistro is decked out with ship posters and continues the theme with seared salmon filets, seafood risotto, lobster cobb salads, and Ecuadorian giant prawns
Guests preferring less fishy dishes dine on penne Bolognese, baby back ribs, and New York steak
A step up from the neighboring diners and quick-bite eateries, the Murray Hill restaurant gets dressed up with brick walls, a fireplace, and yellow sconces for a warm at-home casualness
Hudson Place is a pretty good place
The food is excellent fresh
The bartenders know how to make an excellent drink
I'm a REALLY picky Martini guy each time I've been to HP it's made to perfection
Considering the high quality of the food drink HP is bargain
The drawbacks to HP are the lousy decor, ambiance that feels like a Houlihans service that can range from OK to lousy
The last time we were there the hostess looked on as a woman allowed her screaming 3 year old to climb up a little wall next to us drool on our table
To get the inattentive parents attention we just started peppering our conversation with the F word
She scopped up her little brat got him far away fast
The excellent, modestly priced food (including desserts) deserve better decor better servers
I ate at Hudson Place for the first time last week as it was recommended to me by a friend
I was very impressed by the promptness by which we were greeted and seated
The restaurant exudes a charm about it in its naval outfitting, warm wood and brick walls, and relaxing lighting
The bar is non-intrusive and I imagine great for an after work drink
The food was delicious
I had their seared yellow fin tuna which was well-cooked and flavorful
Oh and please do try their cheesecake
Furthermore, their prices are extremely reasonable
This place is a gem and is not to be missed
Truly the most seductive menu in the neighborhood
Compliments to the chef - Hudson Place has one of the best crab cakes one may find outside of New England, and the steaks give a really explosive taste
Service is great, as the waiters are all friendly, food takes a while to be prepared, but the atmosphere of the place allows one to divulge into great conversations
Once a little secret of mine, now a neighborhood pleaser
My friends and I have been coming to this restaurant for the past several years every time we visit New York
It is still one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Sure, nothing is perfect but 9 out of 10 pleasant experience isn't bad, compare with some of the high profile restaurants you have in NYC
The friendly staff, healthy portion of wines by the glass and the menu selection make the place popular
For weeks, I have been walking by this place and admiring the posted menu and prices
I finally tried the Sunday Brunch
What a mistake
First, we waited 40 minutes for our food, but after a thrity minute wait, the waitress asked me to clarify what I had ordered (I ordered off their menu, with no changes)
Then our three entrees arrived, and were luke warm at best
the food wasn't inspirational as described in the menu
Not surprisingly, when we were done, the check arrived almost immediately
We did complain to the manager, but she just said there are problems in the kitchen and took the drinks off bill
The only time I will ever return to this joint, is if they hang a banner outside that states :Under new management
Hudson Place looked like a great neighborhood place: always busy, nice decor, inventive, full menu
However, upon trying it I was a bit disappointed
The seafood risotto I had was a little too soupy for my liking
My dining companions Lobster was a little overcooked and ravioli a little too cheesy
The bottle of wine we split however, was excellent
Prices weren't as high as I thought they might be
Overall, I'm still not sure about the place but, I'm willing to give it another try
This place was awful for so many different reasons
It took a long time for a host to appear to seat us
I wanted to order an extra dish to split with my friend
I was told that I would be charged for two dishes if I wanted the pancakes split beforehand
In addition, they brought my friend the wrong dish, didn't apologize and it took at least a half an hour till the new dish arrived
Save your money and time, go someplace else
I cannot say enough good things about the restaurant Hudson Place on Third Avenue at 36th Street
This is a quiet neighborhood restaurant that is also fun and hip
The meals are excellent, and there is often a rich variety of choices on the specials menu
Its always a pleasure to visit Hudson Place, and I recommend it heartily
I was recently introduced to Hudson Place and I have to say that it is one of the best restaurants that I have been to
The restaurant is good for a small table and a large group of people
Every time I go the food is wonderful, the ambiance convivial, the liquor free-flowing
It's amazing to escape with so low a bill, every time

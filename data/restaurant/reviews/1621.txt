This place is an NYC classic in my mind
Even if the overall experience has slipped a bit, it is still one of the most worthwhile meals in the east village
Very authentic, very spicy, very tasty!
I think the food and service has gotten worse and worse
What bothers me most is that they are not trying hard enogh to improve anything at all
This place still accepts only cash, treats customers like one of many
, I have to agree with reviewers that it's not worthy to trip here spending your money and negative energy
There are many good Korean bbq restaurants like Togi at 7th street and Yakiniku JUJU at 28th street where you can have Shabu-shabu as well
Very over-rated
The food is mediocre and overpriced
You'll get better service and better food at a better price in Flushing
This place is really all about hanging out and people watching
It's an East Village yawn
In Short Located in a landmark building opposite the Public Theater, the trademark palm-leaf decor has aged gracefully and the deep green banquettes are glam enough to make anyone feel like a Euro-royal or a duty-free heiress
The food--essentially a toytown version of Asian cuisine--doesn't get in the way of table-hopping
The bar area up front is nearly as good
Delicious food-- especially the duck breast with bok choy
They are extending their prefix menu til Labor Day, so definitely try to take advantage
The service was amazing-- even though the place was crowded, we were not rushed at all
Its an amazing place with some of the most friendly staff
what more can i say, Ycenia became a great friend of mine and we still stay in touch although I left NYC 3 years ago
its got a great bar, awesome food, beautiful people looking after you, great ambience
the list is endless for me
Go there on a date (and you can walk in with a different one every time if you want and the staff might smile but never give your secret out)
Enjoy the spring rolls and even talk to people on tables next to you
Miss the duck!!! But most of all i miss the place where i could go any evening of the week and have a great great time!!!! If you are on a date and you are not getting lucky after Indochine
dump her!
I don't believe I've ever experience such a lack of service at a nice restaurant
We ate at 5:30, and I specified when making the reservation that we were attending the theater at 7:00
Our model-wannabe waitresses (7 servers and only 3 tables of diners) seamed more concered with gossiping and checking their makeup than with helping us
They messed up one of the drink orders, two of my party's appetizer orders, and had no idea who was to get what
Our water was only filled at the beginning of the meal
We ordered a small bottle of pellegrino (we were charged for two) and a beer which we had to ask for 3 times, and which took 15 minutes to arrive
No one asked us how anything was and, truth be told, while the meal tasted okay, I will _never_ go back again
After seeing a show at Joe's Pub we were pleasantly surprised that Indochine was still open
A friend had recommended it to me, but I had never been there
The room was very busy yet not so busy as to dissuade us from staying
The hostess was very attentive
There was a fifteen minute wait, we ended up having some of their signature drinks at the bar
The hostess came back to seat us, but the bar and lounge area was very comfortable so we decided to dine at the bar
The bouillabaise was excellent as was the vegetarian dish that my friend had
I highly recommend Indochine for drinks (Indochine Martini) and dinner, one of the friendliest staffs that we have come across; the dining room was warm and inviting and the lounge was very cozy
Bridge and tunnel need not apply
The food and service here are absolutely divine
I've been coming here for nearly a decade, and have never had a complaint
If you want delicious food and beautiful staff to serve you, look no further
One of the reasons why New York is still what it is
To start with , the snobbiest service (if u can call that Service) i ever encountered in such upscale restarant
I figured the service is bad ,the food must be good
, Wrong!
The duck (and I specilize in duck ) was completly like rubber and dry nothing close to the duck I'm used to
In Feb I confirmed what the reviews said: excellent food, great ambiance, but that service
especially the hostess
The place is a little loud, but the overall environment is great for any type of occassion, even for the annoying loud people celebrating a b-day on the table next to us
Overall, definitely worth a try
I know places can be a little crazy during restaurant week
I went there with a few friends during restaurant week, and found the service to be extremely slow
The menu was very interesting, but I felt as if my dish was drenched in a sauce that was a little too overpowering
The ambiance is nice though
I think I will give this place another go
I think I was there at the wrong time (AVOID RESTAURANT WEEK!)
I was shocked about the amount of choices for Restaurant Week
Indochine has something for everyone (even vegetarians)
The food was phenomenal (probably one of the best meals I've had in NYC)
The service was slow, but is understandable considering how crowded the restaurant was
I will definitely return!
This place has a great vibe: romantic, trendy chic
Went here with a group of 7 - including one veggie-tarian
We shared numerous appitizers (crab cakes and ribs were tasty!), two bottles of wine (Malbec), we each ordered mains and shared a few desserts
Everything was full of flavor yet not overpowering
Its priced average for a NYC restaurant reasonably for a NYC trend spot
Would def recommend and visit again
Went for my 2 year anniversary and was pleasantly surprised by the experience
Although this resturant has been around since the 80's it still has it's grooving, sexy, vibe
Tasteful dishes were enjoyed with a delicous bottel of wine and topped with a romantic desert
Will defintely go back to enjoy more occasions!
maybe this place used to be cool back in the studio 54 days but it completely sucks now
the food is so awful and overpriced, the decor totally dated, and the staff are wannabe models that you feel bad for since they're obviously never going to make it
Not to mention the drinks are things you'd order in LA circa 1992 like lychee martinis
sure, they're tasty, but no need to act like they're some sort of super innovative retro drink that is the new thing
i can't even believe i'm wasting so much time on this place
This place has been around forever and its still as good as its always been
Good food (small portions however), good service (cute waitresses all around) and a nice ambience with good looking people matching the background
Great place for a date and to take friends for a nice dinner!
Have been coming here for many years has yet to disappoint
Lychee Martini is addictive and the food is amazing
A little pricey but worth it
Mixed crowd but never tacky
Seating on the banquette is preferable
This place has the most amazing food
The staff is beautiful and courteous
Feels like I've entered some classy restaurant nestled cozily in the middle of a jungle
The ravioli is my favorite dish, try it!!!
After some friends had recommended Indochine I checked it out on citysearch and decided do go with some girlfriends for a girls night out
The hostess war a little impatient and did show a some attitude but the wait staff made more than up for it
True the waitresses are beautiful but also warm, sweet, helpful and professional
The food was basic but very good
I'll definatly be back
Trendy food but colourless
Great deserts, though

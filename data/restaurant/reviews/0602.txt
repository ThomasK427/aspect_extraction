Ask before you order
a bit too fab for my taste, however the food was better than expected
the door staff needs a little course in hospitality but once we were sitting down it was another story
margaritas are a must!!!!
The food at this restaurant is edible, but not very good
I wonder why they are opening a second restaurant with this second rate chef
The service was very good, but they really did not understand this food
To bad
I hope the food gets better because thus far I am NOT impressed
Good Luck!!!
Margs are great (though the drinks menu is overwhelming and somewhat pretentious
) Guac is fine, but Rosa Mexicana is better
Starter soft-shell tacos and seafood also scored, while entrees were OK
Now a word about children: My wife and I went at just before 4 p
m
on a weekend day so that we could take our baby without bothering anyone
There was only one other couple in the restaurant, and they were leaving, yet the hostess still gave us a hard time about the stroller
Clearly, not for the family, and non-singles, non-hip need not apply
Also, waiters are a bit overbearing about food choices
Food: OK
Attitude: in abundance
Postscript: our baby was silent and sweet the whole time!
I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant
The prices were reasonable
The atmosphere was fun, it is very crowded and loud
Not really a romantic setting but great for a group of friends or couples
The Sangria was excellent
The guacamole salad was the best I've ever had
They make it for you fresh at the table
As far as the food, It was very good for the most part
The fish dishes were excellent (especially for a latin themed restaurant
) The fajitas and quesidillas were just average
The food was definately a step up from what we got at the Miracle Grill (Similar in theme and price)
The service was not memorable in a good or bad way
All in all I would recomend this place for a group looking for a fun place to go out
Dos Caminos belongs in South Beach
Great place to go out with friends
The music is great
The Sangria (both red and white) is great
The guacamole is great
The entrees are hit-or-miss though
The food was good one weekend then two weeks later it wasn't as good
Dos Caminos was a great experience! Great food, great atmoshphere and most importantly GREAT SERVICE
The server and chef were very accomodating-especially to the vegetarian in our party
They went dos steps beyond most other restaurants that would have just slapped a couple of bland grilled vegetables on a plate
The mushroom tacos were just one of the great vegetarian plates they created for us
Overall, the friendliness, knowledge and accomodation of the servers, manager and chef were excellent
It almost made up for the sullen hostess at the front desk
We will definitely return to Dos Caminos
Dos Caminos was a wonderful dining experience
We can highly recommend the margeritas and sangria
Our waitress was friendly and informative
One of our party was a vegetarian and the chef made every effort to meet those needs
The guacamole, made to order at our table, was superb
We each had a different main course and they were all very tasty
The desserts were delicious and the mexican coffee excelente
We'll be back!
The drinks and APPS were really good and the space is beautiful, however my chicken Enchilada was horrible, it had dark meat and BONES in it
I might as well have ate at Benny's Burrito and saved $100
Very overpriced, too much attitude and poor ventilation at the bar!
to start, a (truly) mexican restaurant should reflect a culture that is warm and hospitable, not a snob, snotty attitude towards its patrons
we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation, margaritas were unremarkable, guac was just good, hand made tortillas looked machine made (for great tortillas go to Rosa) and tasted like rubber
The food is lackluster and very far away from authentic
the menu is littered with mango, papaya and passionfruit from apps to entrees, but what really blew me away was the ribs
BBQ ribs in a mexican restaurant? hilarious
With a side of chili beans? depressing
I should have gone to Chili's and I would have missed nothing
All in all this is just another pretty Manhattan restaurant built on hype and a well-stocked bar
This was a wonderful upscale Mexican restaurant
The freshly made guacamole is not to be missed
The atmosphere is great and the menu has plenty of choices
This was not a typical Be Our Guest experience
The food was good, only one of the dishes ordered by our 5-person group would I order again
Our tableside prepared guacamole was prepared as the wait station
However the rudeness and greediness of our waiter ruined our dining experience
I felt as if our entire meal was about him pushing us to pay a little bit more
I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome and I will not return to Dos Caminos
The waiter's attitude does not necessarily represent all of the servers, but at high prices one bad experience is enough for me
THE OCTUPUS CEVICHE IS FIRST RATE, AND THE SOUP WHICH IS NOTHING LIKE SOUP IS EXCELLENT
150 CHOICES FOR TEQULA AS WELL AS A VERY ELEGANT MODERN ROOM WITH A LOW LEVEL OF NOICE FOR A ROOM THAT LARGE, ALL ADD UP TO A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
THE ENTREES ARE LIMITED BUT THE FISH PLATES ARE TASTY
A DEFINATE MUY BUENO
i made excuses as i was disapointed all along the way
yes, seating took a while even with a reservation (christmas season is busy), waitress seemed put out by our requests for your basic food drink (maybe a rough night), music - top 40 from '97 (perhaps not the usual sound system), the prepared tableside guacamole was prepared elsewhere - where? not sure where ( maybe there wasn't room for him to do it tableside), and lastly the food -no excuses here - over cooked meat and after specifically asking for the most flavorful dish --pointed to the ribs - there was no spice, no flavor, no nothing
blah
hopefully they will work out growing pains, because its so darn pretty, their tequila list is killer, and the rest of their restaurants are so good
management - quick! help this place before you lose it
Dos Caminos is atmospheric, with lighting fixtures that look like tree stumps and great Latin music
Be careful with a large group, as the noise lever is high
The food is interesting but not extraordinary
Despite wild reviews of the guacamole (prepared tableside), ours was nothing special
The chicken mole is a standout
Unfortunately, the clueless service put a damper on the evening
In addition to being slow, it was completely disorganized
At one point, the waiter told us that he couldn't find our wine! Then entrees were served and he disappeared, neglecting to realize that we needed knifes and forks to eat
Clearly needs more work, not up to usual BR Guest standards
I had a great time at Dos Caminos
The food was the most traditional Mexican I have so far since moving to the Northeast
I've been to Dos Caminos twice
after my first bad experience, I thought I'd give it another chance

portions are generous
i've been twice and have tried different dishes each time
duck and soft shell crab are must haves
will leave your palette craving more!
Nana, one of Brooklyn's newest 5th Ave (it's said that 5th Ave is the new Smith St) is very promising
This Asian fusion restaurant has a tantalizingly inventive menu; one can make a meal of small dishes or order entrees
The beef salad had a lovely dressing, but the generous portion of beef was slightly overcooked
I did not like the tuna sashimi, the very sweet sauce completely drowned the delicate flavor of the fish
The yellow tail sashimi was delicious, served in endive leaves with a tangy (horseradish?) sauce
The dragoon roll was just great, here slivers of mango are added to this common eel and avocado maki
The space is large and comfortable with a cool electronic soundtrack, yet great acoustics for a conversation
(The fish in the dark basement bathroom made me sad
) Nana-not perfect, but worth another try
Its got a funky/mod decor with not-too-loud techno music
Very good service
Had nice spicy shrimp soup, sushi bunch of tasty appetizers
Only weak spot was timing - sushi was made a bit before served - rice got cold and tempura soft
Other than that its a welcome addition to the Park Slope restaurant row!
A truly excellent addition to the growing restaurant scene on 5th Avenue
Exceptional food at prices that are very reasonable
Looking forward to becoming a regular
Okayama is one the best sushi values in the city
Their Special Rolls menu section is not to be missed--the Black Pepper Tun and Mexican Rolls are worth a trip alone
If you love Sushi, I cannot recommended this small, understated resturant enough
Oka Yama is a little hole in the wall, but you'll get personal service and amazing inventive sushi
My favorite is the black pepper tuna salad
The sushi chef goes out of his way to please (the sushi lunch will blow you away with its diversity)
Since business has picked up however, they might be a little less eager
Walked in not expecting much but was very happy with choice
The black pepper tuna sushi is really different and fantastic
The blue fin toro and sweet shrimp were awesome
The service is a little too slow but Yama makes up for it because he always is there to be friendly
Great sushi for first avenue
Food was excellent value as well as quality
Service and staff were extremely welcoming, and friendly
Definately reccomended if you want a relaxed night out with a bit of live entertainment
Small, Intimate great live jazz on friday nights , geat mood starter
and best of all great food and i love the tables
Orbit is a perfect addition to the up and coming East Harlem
Orbit's characteristics are unlike any restaurant in the other burroughs
The location and the staff make you feel like you're in the true, traditional, neighborhood New York
The staff contribute in making the atmosphere warm, Italian and cozy, creating the perfect ambiance
The menu is wonderful, selective and made to perfection
What more can I say!
I love this place! The staff is very nice,the food is sooooooo good,mmmm!! I like it for dinner or just to have drinks and chit-chat with friends
You gotta check it for yourself then you'll know what I'm talking about
I'll see you there!!
What an incredible find! The chef from Poe is cooking here
Excellent everything
not a fine dining experience -- great place to grab lunch though
lots of great baked goods -- try the raspberry creme brulee tart i think it was? plus lots of salads and sandwiches ready made to grab or made to order if you want
homemade soups, veg and non, every day too
gourmet-esque salads and sandwiches, but actually i was surprised that all the prices are under $10 and lots even less
good casual place in tribeca - grab a sandwich and eat in the nearby park
The Scene Tucked on a cobbled street far downtown, the restaurant is housed in a historic building, though exposed brick is the extent of the restaurant's old-New York flair
The interior is decorated with contemporary art and enlivened by loud-ish pop music
A financial crowd mobs the place at lunch, but it's peaceful at dinner
The Food To start the meal, try plump, tender mussels prepared a la mariniere or Provencale (in a tomato broth)
Daily soups, such as cream of mushroom and cream of celery, are luxurious
The menu features versions of bistro classics, including juicy, savory steak frites, succulent roast duck with figs, roast chicken with rosemary mashed potatoes and deeply flavorful bouillabaisse
At lunchtime, a variety of sandwiches are available as well
Desserts are satisfactory
Highly recommend the small but strangely intimate, sunken patio, particularly for a light meal or afternoon drink
Even a modest bottle of wine was accurately described by the wait staff and pleasing
Though the true highlights were the encouraging reaction from the waiter at the order of a traditional and less common dish (Ouefs Meurette), the incredible food itself, and a very genuine and engaging follow-up from the chef
This is a place you'll be proud to know and bring friends
I took a group of 7 to lunch and had a great time
Service was a little spotty - we had to wait for the wine refill
The steak frites and the desserts were delicious
Everyone had a great time
highly reccomend this little french gem for a delightful lunch in a not so delightful business area
the croque monsiuer et salade nicoise were perfect for a nice, satisfying escape from the workday
The Scene It's the sort of beloved neighborhood haunt where locals stop by the clubby bar for after-work beers, young families frequent for easy-going meals and artsy BAM-goers retire for late-night desserts in the wooded, wainscoted dining room
With half-moon antique windows, ornate plaster ceilings and retro Austrian beer signs, the sunset-colored space is comfortably elegant, and graciously tended to by an international staff
The Food The versatile Austrian menu, fused with French and American, rewards both high and low-end appetites: rich, cheese-laden onion soup, grilled Gruyere and country ham sandwiches and big-bunned burgers are as satisfying as velvety liver terrine with kumquat-cranberry compote, speck and sausage charcuterie and inexpensive cheese plates
Heart-warming, assured entrees--beef cheek gulash with buttery spaetzle, caraway-rubbed sauerkraut pork with knodel and little crocks of aromatic short rib Pot au Feu with grated horseradish and marrow--are best followed by inexpensive, insanely good traditional sweets, like bittersweet chocolate-hazelnut crepes
This is a nice restaurant in the Ft Greene area
The food is good, not a whole lot for the vegetarian, but the fried breaded mushroom starters are excellent, I've ordered them every time I frequent the restaurant, and they are always perfectly fried, (not too greasy
hmmm)
Nice cod and fish dishes
Romantic atmosphere and polite service
I lived in Vienna for years and can attest to the authenticity of Thomas Beisl
The service could be better, but the food is tops
The ambiance is also good: cozy in the restaurant in winter and delightful on the patio in summer
Just don't go pre- or post-theater as it's too full
Landing there after a show has started at BAM is perfect
Brunches are also worth checking out
They also have some nice Austrian wines
We've been to the Thomas Beisl several times and we love it
The owner and staff make you feel very comfortable and let you relax even after you finished eating - like it is tradition in Austria
The food is great, real Austrian comfort food
I can also recommend the Austrian Goesser beer which they have on draft
Try to go during the week, the restaurant gets very busy before and after BAM shows on weekends
I went last night and was incredibly disappointed
The food was fine - the crepes soggy, the weiner schnitzle, excellent - but things took a nosedive when the dining rooms cleared out due to a show at BAM
It was then that I noticed that not one plate had been cleared from any table
Finally, one of the waitstaff noticed and brought out a dirty bus pan which he put on the table next to me and started bussing the entire dining room
Once that chore was completed, he brought out a large, black, plastic bag which he proceeded to fill with dirty linens
All the while, a rather large fellow in a tank top and camo pants (the manager?) was yelling at the rest of the waitstaff audibly enough that I was able to follow his entire tirade from where I sat in the secondary dining room
Apparently I'm the only one who didn't enjoy this restaurant

He said ask for him next time
He even brought over his girlfriend Donna to meet my grandma
Will definitely go back to Blue Water Grill!!!
This restaurant had a Sex The City feeling when you walk in
Very trendy
just when I thought I checked out all my surroundings, the food and service took my attention
I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends that are in the area
I have and will go back again and again
Very romantic setting in the coolest area of Manhattan
Union Square
The food is extraordinary
What a nice time we had at this place
Service is not bad and the food isn't either
Not my favorite seafood place in the city, but it could be if they keep up the good work
This restaurant and bar is beautiful and the food is really good
Order any of the seafood dishes and you'll surely be pleased
Plus, it is a great atmosphere for a date or just to go to with some friends
For the mere about 50 bucks a piece, it's definitely worth a try
Any restaurant comparable in NY is much moer expensive
Still as good as seafood gets, more than six years around as one of NY's best seafood restaurants
A must try (go during week days)
It's pretty loud on the first floor, definitely not conducive to conversations
But the sushi was super fresh and delicious
I got the tropical style shrimp salad to start - it started to be a bit too much about halfway through
Otherwise, the food was great! I'd go back again! Only scary part was watching that staircase shake when a guy ran down it!
I adore this restaurant
I don't know what is better, between the lobster eggs benedict or the grilled chicken cobb- this place is my favorite sit outside and enjoy the city restaurant!
This is the best place for seafood in NY
Classy but comfortably casual the outdoor seating is wonderful for two and the service is flawless
A experience worth every penny
We dinned here for our first wedding anniversary
The food was excellent, the atmosphere was great
The waiter wasn't the greatest but we made the most of it
He didn't seem to have any knowledge of wine and what would compliment my meal
Only other problem was the table being too small and too close to other table's not much privacy for romance
Other than that a great experience
everything was wonderful about this place
we had reservations and we did have to wait a bit for our table but they apologized and all was well
the oysters were so fresh and yummy!!! great wine and wonderful deserts
definitely highly recommended!!!
The Blue Water Grill has style, with it's first rate menu and an ambiance that is sure to put a smile on everyone's face
I used to eat here fifteen years ago when I was fresh out of college and needed an inexpensive vegetarian option
Well, fifteen years later I bring my wife and baby back and the prices haven't changed, the food is still really good, and the people are still very friendly
We had two wonderful meals here, and will make a point of coming back the next time we're in NYC
Where else are we going to feed two adults three courses for $17? HINT: You can bring your own beer with you
Get a couple of bottles of your favorite before you go
I went to this place a second time because of the food
What a change! The lunch special (at $4
95) is one of the best in the city
Soup, an appetizer, a main course, nan, rice, ice cream and tea are included for this price
Absolutely astonishing! (I recommend the samosas and saag panir)
In Short There's always an interesting crowd at this neighborhood cafe: people on dates, solo diners with newspapers, a knitting-club meeting taking a coffee break
The eclectic lunch and dinner menus feature salads, Middle Eastern-style vegetarian platters, pastas and a variety of chicken and seafood entrees
The organic-egg omelettes in 10 varieties--feta and spinach, portobello and shallot or salmon--make this a weekend brunch destination
My boyfriend and I literally eat at this restaurant at least once a week
The food is excellent! The servers are always pritty nice and prompt
I recommend the gaspacho soup, it is out of this world! The food is good for both vegetarians and meateaters with a varity of options
This is my favorite restaurant!
The food was so great
The staff was a mix of all type of people, very fun environment
The service was very fast
I have been back twice the week
It is one of the best kept secret in the East Village
Go one and I bet you will be back again
Cafe Orlin is my favorite brunch spot in the city
Try the eggs florentine on the weekend and you won't regret it
They also have a great cup of coffee, and lots of space inside and out
I've been going to Cafe Orlin for 20 years and it never disappoints me
Its a great place to meet a friend, sit for a long time over a great breakfast or brunch
It is one of the few places in the city that makes consistently great cappuccino
The cappuccino is more like what is served in Italy rather than Starbucks
The atmosphere is unpretentious , as is the food
Simple, highest quality ingredients are used
I've been going to Orlin for some years, mostly for some of their staple offerings: delicious hummus, their spicy tomato soup, and their to-die-for warm chocolate cake
If you have a large group or a to-be-determined number of people coming to dinner, they are happy to move chairs around
The only downside service
staff is spaced out and I've experienced snobbishness too
I had a great chicken sandwich here, and I don't even really order chicken sandwiches
To their chicken sandwiches, they add hardboiled eggs
It sounds weird, but its delicious!
perfect place for a friendly/first date, late night group dining or sidewalk seating
i've gone here plenty times
they must be in love with salt
everything was too salty
i liked the atmosphere but they need some help on service
I happened into this casual restaurant on a stroll down St
Marks and was very pleasantly surprised
Calm, neighborhoody atmosphere, but enough going on to feel like you're out for a real dinner
We got a great pitcher of red sangria and delicious hummus/falafel plate
My friend and I sat outside and she was allowed to smoke (because we were sitting in the row of tables closest to the sidewalk)
I highly recommend for an inpromptu meal outdoors
On my most recent visit with two companions to this wonderful little restaurant on St
Marks Place, each of us chose a different dish
All three dishes were excellent
I don't know about the reviewer below who maintains his service was poor; the wait staff has been quite helpful whenever I'm there
They just don't rush you to finish
This is one of my favorite places to eat
Go when you want to relax over well-prepared, fresh food and have good conversations with friends
I like this place too, for dinner or brunch
For brunch, I had the smoked salmon and poached eggs, and it was better here than anywhere else I've had them

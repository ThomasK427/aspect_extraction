I never ate there but I went there a few times on late saturday nights for some beers
The guy at the door is very friendly, the bartender is pretty cool too, and some of the waitresses are really cute
They have DJ's mixing some worldly house on saturday nights
The atmosphere is pretty laid back and very french
I heard from people I know that the food isn't all that, but if you go there to have a few drinks , you'll most likely have a good time unless if you're a dumb anti-french american !
Being a French bistro, this place does not have the best service, but I wouldn't call it rude
The food is really good
Try the goat cheese puffs and that chocolaty, fudgy dessert
Hmmm
The wine list is good too, in addition to some Belgian beers
The atmosphere is cozy
You can come with a date, or celebrate your birthday with 6 friends
Later in the evening, especially on weekends, this place turns into a crowded bar scene with a lot of Europeans and other foreigners
The music is good, and it's fun
Went on a friday night 9:30, got a table for three right away (like in 2 minutes we were seated)
Waiter had corny french accent but he served us fine, relatively prompt, kept our beer glasses full
Had the muscles (solid), garden salad (greens tasted very fresh, priced right at $5 bucks) to start
Had the monkfosh special (which the waiter said was superb ~ i was slightly underwhelmed), with some lame mashed potatoes
My boys had the the flank steak and angus steak, which i tried and thought were also average
They play funky music which i like
Beers are like 8 oz and small, at $6 a pop add up quickly
Total bill with 20% gratuity for 3 was like $150
But we each had 3-4 drinks
Not bad, but not great
If I went there and had to wait for a table I would not go back
I arrived with a friend and was told the wait would be 10min
While waiting we asked the bartender for at glass of red wine which he not only forgot to serve but when we asked him again 10min later he poured us white wine
In addition he decided himself to keep the $2 change as a tip (how rude!!)
We finally got seated 40min later
During dinner we were not able to get any service from the waiter (ie water refill, more bread, coffee) and had to get up and find the waiter ourselves to get the check
I have never written a review before however I feel future customers deserve to be warned of the total lack of service in this place
Before 7pm, there is this great deal where you get a three course meal for $13
99
I had the most amazing mussels for an app, then a steak for the entree
Very quaint and funky, with fantastic food
Good french on the LES
Despite other reviews, wait service was excellent, even though they were busy
The Angus steak, the muscles (a tiny bit sandy), the potato leak soup, and the bread were all fabulous
Tarte tatin was mediocre, but mostly becuase they poured to much liquor on it before flambe
Great place, with its wooden tables, very good wine list and reasonably priced, good food (there is even a vegetarian option)
The only drawback is that you can really smell the kitchen, especially when the chef is frying food
Good place to meet friends and for dates too
just highly unorganized and screwed up
food is ok--french heavy--nothing special
but the service and management is obviously not in tune to their customer's needs
they need to pop their filled up heads a bit and realize that they are JUST WAITERS and there is no need to treat customers poorly
I came for dinner with a group of 10 friends and was extremely happy with the overall experience
The food wine were fantastic and it was agreed that the dessert alone was worth a trip back
We visited on a Friday night, so it was pretty crowded and although we'd made reservations we still needed to wait about 1/2 an hour before our party was seated
If you can score a table in the back room, you'll be subject to a little less noise and have more space
The tables in the bar area are tiny and VERY close together
This was the absolute worst service I experienced in the city
We felt totally rushed and hurried through our meal
The waiter was miffed when we decided to order dessert (and I must say we were eating the courses as they arrived, no lingering)
The second they brought the bill they told us we could finish our conversation at the bar because they needed the table
Plenty of other GOOD French restaurants in city
don't waste your money here
One of the best meals that I have ever had in New York
The food was excellent! We ordered the specials off of the chalk board-clamari, ginger soup and tuna steak
Great atmosphere and vibe
The kitchen staff and food runners work very hard
The wait staff left something to be desired, you had to track them down a bit
The food made up for it and overall it was a great experience
RUDE RUDE RUDE! The owner of this restaurant needs to learn how to treat his patrons
The service and attitude were TERRIBLE! We paid a lot of money to this restaurant to celebrate our friend's birthday and we were thoroughly disrespected and mistreated
AVOID this restaurant
I am still in shock over how the manager of Le Pere Pinard treated our group! We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they booked another party right after ours, and would not let us finish our meal! This was the worse dining experience I have ever had
If you are looking for a place to have a dinner party, you should not even consider this place
I would rather starve than give these jerks another nickel of my money, and I can't encourage you strongly enough to AVOID this restaurant
The food is subpar, the restaurant is uncomfortable, the waitstaff is rude and smelly
But the real problem was the ownership who refused to let us have dessert, a birthday cake we had brought, because one of his friends was waiting for our table
These people are trash, and they treated us like dirt
I went with some friends and had a fantastic time
The host, Fifi (his real name), is charming and flirty; we didn't have reservations, but he came by every now and then to chat and reassure us we would have a table
The wines are amazing--the bartender was knowledgeable and speedy
The shepherd's pie is delicious--steaming, crusty mashed potatoes covering beef and vegetables
The flank steak was tender and flavorful
The DJ played some great music as well
Note: Everyone was smoking and it was really loud--you may not like it if you want to hear well or keep your lungs clear
But if you don't mind that, you'll love it
A perfectly French experience
great bar
fun waitstaff
incredibale food
The steak with fois gras was out of this world!
Order a few appetizers, a bottle of wine and some dessert and you'll be set for the evening
Winning service from the waitstaff; good records from the house DJ
The Scene This is a noisy space, slickly designed but somewhat cramped and frantic
Wine-bottle chandeliers and multicolored upholstery give a faintly retro feel
On weekend nights and pre-theater, the bar writhes with humanity, indifferently supervised by the clumsy hosting staff
The Food It's not exactly traditional Mexican fare, but that country's flavors and techniques enliven the often excellent food here
It's hard to miss: The tuna tartare, served on mini-tostadas with mild guacamole, and the flavorful grilled salmon steak with spicy wilted greens, are outstanding
Intrigue can be found in the tamale filled with musky huitlacoche fungus topped with dark salsa and mascarpone
Beer-braised lamb shank is tender and zingy with chile flavor, and a rare duck breast in mole sauce is exceptionally tasty
Desserts run the fruity gamut, from a nice tres leches cake with preserved cherries to an overly dense--yet still great--pumpkin flan
Hell's Kitchen from the outside looks like another trendy place featuring fusionesque food, but in hindsight is much more than that
Taking a chapter from traditional Mexican cuisines and adding a flair of contemporary fusion, they as a result feature some of the most unique dishes the neighborhood has to offer
Its expensive, but its also somewhat exclusive
The atmosphere is always dimly lighted for that ambiant effect and the service can be a bit pretentious at times
This restaurant is a great dinner date option, but beware of the wait time as the place itself is not very big

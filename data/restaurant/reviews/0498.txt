They have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good
I think this a a wonderful place
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside
It's the kind of place I like to support!
I have not seen any famous people - but I love the juices and smoothies
Try the Peanut Butter Split (with soy milk!)  I also like the Pumpkin or Banana Soy Bundts - yummy!  Have you noticed that this place always spells good? Maybe that's a business secret to keep us coming back!
I visit Juice Generation at least 4 times a week in the winter
Those hot drinks that they have are awesome -- I especially like the Cold Warrior green tea drink
If I feel like I might be getting a cold, I always try the Exta C drink with tons of vitamin C, strawberries, and fresh squeezed apple juice (yummy!!)  I also like the sandwiches they offer, although the Cranny Smith Tuna (my favorite!) is usually sold out if I opt for a late lunch
I noticed that Juice Generation is nominated for Best Celeb Hangout on Citysearch
I have seen both Hugh Jackman and Vanessa Williams (beautiful!) in the store (also a guy from The Real World) My boss was in line behind Mr
DiCaprio himself about 2 years ago!  I give this place TWO THUMBS UP -- great smoothies, hot drinks, and sandwiches!
Look, I'm your tipical 9-5 junk food/pizza guy who could think of nothing less apetizing than a plate of squash with a side of hummus
But on the advice of some locals, i checked out Organic
FANTASTIC! Seriously
While they have everything a card carrying vegan would require for foodstuffs, I found the food tasty and will return everytime I'm even near 3rd Ave and 53rd
THe Big Daddy saitan is great, and the smoothie things are outstanding
Bottom Line: Great food, great taste and great menu
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, soup, pizza etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world! I must for vegans, vegetarians, and even meat eaters
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese!
I love their Takoyaki but the service was beyond BAD
horrified
Girls working there did not know how to treat a customer at all
They were ignoring, relentlessly chatting and totally APATHETIC
She almost threw Takoyaki onto the counter
When we asked her something, she went ehhhhhh? with an open mouth
SAD
We tried the plain ($3) and cheese ($4) pancake balls
There was quite a wait for the cheese ones but it was worth it
Each order is 6 balls
A bit pricey but it's tasty
The store front is take-out, and no more than a stand with a little standing room (no seating) inside for up to 6 people
This is a little find in the East Village studded with Japanese restaurants
Otafuku serves Japanese street food/snacks that you would not find in a sushi bar
Try the takoyaki [octopus balls] made of bits of octopus, red ginger, and scallions in a baked batter ball (a treat to watch it being made) similar to the Danish abelskivers
Okonomiyaki (cabbage pancake with your choice of fillings) is another recommendation
Combination platters are available
Reasonable prices
By the way, Otafuku is the brand name of a condiment sauce similar to ketchup used on the takoyaki
My company is located a mere block away so we've pretty much made this our central perk
We know the bartenders by name and they are all so friendly and down to earth
There are no flashy, pretentious waiters or bartenders, it's like a family
I don't know about the prices because my company always fits the bill, but when it comes to atmosphere and service, you get the feeling of Cheers, everyone knows your face at least and no one (meaning other patrons) really pays attention to you
You get good songs for a good price and good drinks (no watered down)
They also bring in a band on some nights, I believe on the weekends especially and the bands are usually very good
Nice and well-rounded
I am a hip-hop fan, but my co-workers love mostly rock, but we ALL have a good time
stayed at comfort inn across street and cause the weather was awful, we decided to check out the local restaurants
The hostess was very friendly and told us of all the specials
The food was quite tasty and a great price for New York
A great value
Good food and cheap drinks
Great for hanging out and getting to know somebody
Stellar food -- old school sopressata sandwich (not on the menu anymore but the sandwich jedi in the back can whip one up pronto), fabulous ciabatta creations, amazing polenta, yummy guac, and one of the best brunches in the village!   Staff has changed, less friendly and less attentive
Manager can be very blunt but he's a good guy
Music has changed; used to be great, amazing, well-balanced jazz that still let you have a quiet conversation
Now it's louder blues with the guitar amp turned up so loud you can't hear the piano or your friends
Drinks very tasty and priced New York style; stay away from their specials and your dry martini with lots of olives will be nice to your tongue and wallet
Fun people watching, especially on the weekends
Our waitress knew that our group of five was only ordering drinks, and she offered a table to us anyway
We proceeded to order a stream of expensive cocktails and bottled water, but clearly we were not spending enough $
It began to fill up, and we had just finished our cocktails and were about to leave (we had even collected the check) when the manager came over and said (in an extremely rude tone) I don't mean to be rude, but there are people waiting and it is time for you to go
We were floored
We had done nothing to deserve this hostility, other than fail to order dinner, which they were aware of when we arrived! To make matters worse, the waitress followed us out, and demanded that we leave a better tip
We shouldn't have left a tip at all, and we WON'T be going back
Your best bet is to visit Rue B on a weekend during happy hour
Drinks are half-price (at the bar ONLY)
Shane should be working the bar and you can pretty much be guaranteed your drink will be nice
If it's not simply say something and he'll make it right
Rob follows up for the late night crowd and he's equally accomodating
The food is fantastic
It's better than typical bar fare with options ranging from antipasta to polenta and desserts to match
It does get crowded, though, and, like every other piece of real estate in NYC, space is limited
It's definitely one of my favs and promises to remain as such
Pros: fair prices for great drinks and food, good music, live music (on occasion), great photos, nice people
Cons: small space, the occasional pretentious bloke
Verdict: rock on!
I randomly walked on in the other night and the place was packed with nice people
They had live music and one of the best piano players I have ever seen
He completely took over the bar
The service was great as well
I'll defintely be back!
Way too loud when packed
One perfectly nice waitress versus one psycho waitress, somewhat clueless bartender and a hyper-sensitive owner make it kind of unpredictable
The unassuming Jazz trio makes it more mellow on less crowded nights
The sweet drinks will get you over the top before you know it
Low key, great food, well-mixed drinks, EXTREMELY nice and accomodating staff, great jazz (but you can still hear who you are talking to!), there is nothing bad I can say about this place
Highly recommended
Cozy, welcoming lounge-restaurant
Came here on a Saturday night
No-cover jazz that was actually pretty decent
A good atmosphere crowd--not snooty and not boorish
Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves
A nice (not overwhelming) selection of light plates, appetizers, sandwiches and cocktails
I had a mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula panini--yummy
Everything at gentle prices
looks like a cafe--I was surprised to have such tasty treats and a great selection
had a bluefish spread on toast which was really, really good

What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!
everything was overpowered by their seasoning
i think seasoning should enhence the flavor of meat and fish not overpoewer them
both appetizer and main were poorly made by some random cooks the picked up from who knows where
what a waste of money
took 30 co-workers there for dinner and it was terrific
very professional event manager who accommodated our every request
waitstaff and captain were first rate
they did their job very well without intruding
and everyone loved the food
I have been to most of the better Mexican or Nuevo Latino restaurants in the city (Zocalo, Calle Ocho, etc
) and the overall experience at Rosa is right up there
The food was very tasty and the drinks were well made
The house special pomegranite margarita is a must try
The place is chic and nicely made up except that the bathroom is a LONG flight of stairs away and the place is very crowded
My main gripe is that it is a bit expensive (even for Manhattan) and I have never been to a mexican restaurant that doesn't serve a complimentary bowl of chips and salsa
What's up with that? They only serve chips to those who order the $14 guacamole
For the $ charged for dinner, they could throw in some chips
I was brought here for a business lunch and I thought it was better than I expected from reading all the mixed reviews
I thought the food was excellent
For the table, we got the guacamole that they make tableside and I thought it was very good and they give you two different sauces that you can spice it up if you want to
The portion sizes were generous for lunch and I left stuffed
My co-workers all got the enchiladas which they said were very good
I got the steak tacos and the steak was juicy and flavorful
I would definitely try this restaurant for dinner since I had such a good experience at lunch
excellent ambiance
Too bad the food and service do not match
The menu teased and tantalized, but the food couldn't live up to the descriptions
The service was as cold as the design of the place was festive
Provides every positive aspect of dining out: great location, ambience, service, drinks, and of course, food
Be sure to make a reservation--it can get crowded
If you can't handle paying $14 for fresh guacamole made to order right at your table, you don't belong in New York City
The menu offers seafood (e
g
, red snapper stuffed with crab), beef, pork, and mostly chicken dishes, plus a couple of vegetarian options
Fresh, delicious, and a perfect NYC night out
By far the best Mexican restaurant in NYC
The guacamole is consistently fantastic
Service is great
Try the goat cheese empanadas -- they are amazing!
As far as I'm concerned, all you really need to know is this: a double order of guacamole is $28
That's right
Twenty-eight freakin' dollars for a very average serving of guacamole
I was with two other people and the waiter recommended a double order for a party of more than two, so we fell for it
$28 for guacamole is criminal
It's making my skin crawl as I write this
The owners should be locked up for larceny
It makes me so sick I want to spit
The restaurant is otherwise a nice experience, but never, ever, ever order a double order of guacamole
Go buy yourself a couple CDs instead
Give it to the homeless person on the corner, but never, ever pay $28 to these criminals for that crap
I'm still pissed off about it
If the owner or manager is reading this
Shame on you!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best upscale mexican restuarant in NY! Great tastings of Tequila, awesome food and who can complain about their guacamole dip? And I am not even a big fan of guacamole dips in general
This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants
this place is killer
i have eaten here mnay times and love it it
it's the best mexican around
When I hear the words 'seamless service' this is the place I remember - it seems just as you start to think you need something someone appears with it
Love that tableside guacamole and margaritas!
Waited on the walk in line this weekend at 7:30 and was not seated until 9pm! However, the guacamole was to die for, simple and fresh! Although there were not many selections for vegetarians the stuffed poblano chilis kept me well satisfied
My bf told me his pork dish was yummy too
The food here is of generous proportions and prices are moderate
The service was friendly and not too overbearing
Make sure to sit upstairs in the beautiful romantic dining room
Next time, will make sure to make reservations!
I Have lived in NYC for almost 5 years and this past weekend was my very first trip to Rosa! The service top notch and the food - AMAZING, I appreciated that in a city full of restaurants, this one has something different and refeshing to offer! The Guac made at the table was such a treat (although you do pay for it) and made the dining experience fun and entertaining - not to mention the fact that is was so good, my fiance and I were practically licking the bowl! All the food was wonderful, you must try the tortilla pie
Furthermore, the portion sizes are big enough for two people - sometihng you rarely find in the big apple!  The drinks were divine - must try the pommegranite margaritas and mimosa's! So, need I say more - hurry and get to Rosa! You wont be sorry!
This Lincoln Center find serves up consistent, delicately prepared fare
For those who feel that Mexican restaurants are no good unless the chips and salsa is waiting for you on the table, and everything is smothered in jack cheese, this may not be the place for you
But if you are looking to experience an incredible meal full of interesting flavors served in a wonderful space, Rosa is highly recommended
And definitely try the guac, it's fantastic!
Food was great, but service was pushy and arrogant
We sensed the waiter felt he was doing us a favour by serving us and the service charge was automatically, but incorrectly added to our check
We expect far more for the money, and will not go back, in spite of the food
To impress a first date with a amazing looking restaurant that has awesome food and pretty good service try Rosa Mexicana near Lincoln Center
Start with the Gaucamole, you'll be happy you did, she'll be impressed with the surroundings and the more than ample amount of space
All of the Entrees are great, but for dessert get the Mango dish, it's really good
After dinner walk by the lit up fountain in Lincoln Center for the first kiss
Trust me, it's a sure bet!
What a gorgeous restaurant! The service was pretty good, and the food was Amazing! Of course we started with the Tri-State famous Guacamole, then had traditional style appetizers, followed by Gourmet entrees that were delicious
For dessert we had the Flan and the Mango dish, which I'd rate up there with Red Eye Grills Banana Cream Pie, it was scrumptious! A great expirience all the way around
We loved it!
Overpriced, with overbearing service and poor food
You will only get chips if you order guacamole
Its tasty but not spectacular
The rest of the meal was bland (i had mole) and not particulary interesting (my husband had the filet mignon and it was just steak, which was poorly cooked)
The waiters only appeared to try to sell you more drinks
A total disappointment
When I first sat down, I noticed that I wasn't squished, and on top of my neighbor like many other New York establishments
For appetizers, ordering Quacamole is a must
They make it fresh right at your table, so even non-avocado fans (me) will enjoy it
My dinner was a perfectly done Filet Mignon with a wild mushroom tequila sauce
They have wonderful desserts as well, but what was different was there extensive list of after dinner drinks
I've never seen so many ways to mix coffe and hot chocolate with liquor
The waitstaff isn't stuffy
The armosphere is great, including the waterfill which just has to be seen to be believed
A wonderful choice for any occasion

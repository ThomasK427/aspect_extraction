There is a specially appointed Saucier who comes to the table with her sauce cart and offers you a choice of 7-8 different sauces
we tried several, each better than the next
Service was impeccable, and the desserts were great too!
Food was great! Saucier was amazing!!!! They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL)
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz? Wonderful dining experience
Dessert was also to die for!
One of the best Restaurants in Dowtown
Nothing to deal with usual hotel Restaurants
It has caracter
Is good for kids as well
The food is amazing and the service is excellent
2 West is clearly on of the best kept secrets in all of manhattan
This French-American steakhouse offers some of the best selections of meat, being one of three in the city having Certified Black Angus Prime Sirloin
To further enrich the experiance a Saucier comes to the table with a selection of 8-10 classically prepared French sauces to accompany your grilled entree
I was amazed at some of the options, truffle sauce
ect  Besides the food, the Ritz staff really know how to spoil you with AMAZING service!!
This is an excellent restaurant
It is a little off the beaten path all the way down in Battery Park, but well worth the trip
Not a trendy hipster hangout this restaurant caters to a mature clientele
The banquets are comfy and the service leaves you pampered
If you go make sure you try the lobster bisque
The steaks are excellent as is the seafood
The elegant atmosphere is completed by the piano playing lounge singer
The Scene A discerning crowd of mostly families comes here expecting--and receiving--food that's a cut above
The small, peaceful dining room is peach-colored with handsome fabric art and a general air of spotlessness
The hovering service staff describe everything in detail
Dishes are served individually, rather than family-style
The Food The clean-flavored, delicate version of Indian cuisine served here is impressively tasty; several discrete notches above the average decent neighborhood establishment
Spinach chaat--peppery, batter-fried leaves topped with zingy mung sprouts--makes a terrific starter; so does a trio of small, subtle samosas
Tandoor-grilled lamb chops are incredibly juicy and savory, and a pear chutney sets them off terrifically
Kararee bhindi--crisp, tangy okra and onion salad--is memorably pungent
Madras chicken and the tomatoey Malabar salmon are standard, while desserts are a must-try, particularly the fluffy housemade mango cheesecake and kulfi in citrus soup
Having heard so much from family and friends in Westchester county
We finally made it to Amma
The day we made the reservation was a Wine pairing dinner evening It was love at first sight
The food was exellent
The choice of wines were stunning
The staff did a wonderful job in explaing each course with the wine pairing
The place was packed with wine pundits, who seemed to be so regulars at the restaurant
We just love this place
I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it
The food was absolutely horrible! And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service! There are much better places in NY with better prices
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off
In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary
so i thought why not change it up a bit
Place was loud, not very romantic, food was 2
5/5 service was 3/5
but still my date was bad
ok its easy
cold food  VERY!!! slow service  Price is to high
I'll keep this short
Amma is nothing special
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
Will not be back
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years
The food is o
k
, but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant
But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high
It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious
The only good part of this place was a candlelight on the table
This has a very cramped setting
The menu is limited
Food quality - particularly, non-veg is bad
Good item was a Bhindi (Okra) item
Spend more than $110 for two and was not satisfied
Once I found this place, it's the first place I think of when I think of Indian food
It is very well prepared and served tastefully
The mix of dishes is great and our waiter has always made great suggestions
We really felt cared for
We have looked for a long time for a good indian restaurant in NYC
And finally we've found one !! Everything is great - very friendly people, good explanantions to the food, very authentic flavours from various regions
Suggestions were made to compliment our meal which turned out to be one of the best indian meals for a long time
Refreshing to see many Indian families and couples, too, enjoying a night out
As Londoners we are quite discerning when it comes to food from the Sub-Continent
and Amma more than lived up to our high expectations
First off, let me just say that this is the first restaurant i've been to that made me open a citysearch acct just to write a review
we got there an hour later than our reservation on a saturday night and they seated us immediately
my husband has certain food allergies, and they were 100% accomodating even for the tasting menu which is seven courses for $50 - they even substituted dishes for ones that he couldn't have
i'm indian, my husband is an indian-food enthusiast, and we both thought that the food was absolutely amazing, as was the ambiance and the service - so thoughtful! just beware that if you get the tasting menu, you'll be there for a solid 2 hours just eating (but perfect amount of food)
can't wait to go back!!
The Food was awesome
The decore was very pleasant and the service was great!!
I grew up in Edison, NJ
so I've had lots of great Indian food
But Amma takes it to a whole new level! The grilled lamb chops and the apricot stuffed lamb fillets are both absolutely AMAZING
At an unbeatable price too
We can't wait to try their tasting menu
Amma is a very welcome change to the other Indian restuarants in the city
My wife and I are regulars
Its also one of the few Indian places where we spotted Indian celebraties like sarod master Ustab Amjad Ali Khan!! Would highly recommend it to all
The menu is innovative and features more than just the usual dishes and the food is tasty
The staff is a little inexpereinced but makes up for it by being very sweet
I wish they would ay more Indian music
western music takes away from the ambience a bit

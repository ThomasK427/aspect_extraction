I receive a call less than a week before Valentine's Day saying they have to change my seating time and that there is now a $60 pre-fix dinner which they told me they weren't going to do 3 weeks ago
VERY LOUSY management and would never consider going there again
My friends and I were very disappointed by our dining experience at this restaurant
The food was fine (nothing special), but our waitress was terriblequite possibly the worst Ive ever had
She seemed distracted and bothered to serve us the entire time
We were excited to try this restaurant, but we left wishing we hadnt
If this restaurant hopes for any return business, I would suggest finding a new waitress
Were sure not going back
My fear is that more people will discover this delicious, tiny restaurant
I promise that if you've had or read a negative FOOD experience at CamaJe, it was a once-in-a-million chance! We randomly tried this West Village spot because were impressed with the varied menu and great prices
We've returned 4 times -- different seasons, #s in our party, mealtimes, etc
, with wonderful results
The food is what brings us back -- seasonal salads to sausages to pastas, sandwiches, and lots of a la carte goodies
Desserts are fabulous! And VERY affordable
Yes, service can definitely be slow
But speeding through a meal is not the reason to go to CamaJe
Go to enjoy a relaxed, warm, pseudo-funky atmosphere (you can even eat at the couch -- so comfy), creative and delilcious comfort-y food, and super desserts
Good for larger parties or intimate nights
It's our favorite West Village restaurant
Service is slow here, only one girl to serve the little restaurant
The food was good, I had the duck special with mashed potatoes and it was tasty and not over cooked
Duck pate, seered tuna and rabbit were good as well, somethings I would order again
Crab cakes weren't as good tho I wouldnt recommend it
This place is perfect for an afternoon glass of wine and a light meal
The food is dainty but has a lot of taste
This restaurant has become my favorite neighborhood spot
The food is tremendous, the prices are VERY reasonable and the space has tons of character
I haven't found anything on the menu I don't like
I have been to Camaje several times and it is my favorite place to have a meal
The atmosphere is low key and comfortable with great mood lighting
The food is fabulous
You should definitely have the crepes which make me smile just thinking of them
The service is friendly and helpful
As someone who's had brunch, lunch and dinner there, I would suggest Camaje for a good, unassuming meal
ZWhat a pleasant surprise
I gave it a shot after not being able to get valentine reservations, only to find out why its given a 23 food rating in zagats
awesome and creative spin on french
I'll definitely be back to try the 25 prix fixe dinner
The food ranges from very good to ok
There is a general lack of attention to detail
(Hanger steak comes without shallots, duck is very greasy)  Stay away from sides and appetizers
The entrees are generally pretty good, and are a value
As warned by others on citysearch, there were some shady antics when the bill arrived
We were charged for an extra dinner, and there seemed to be about 40 dollars we could not account for
Overall, eh
There was a large birthday party going on so that's why the service might have been distracted, but the table next to us went on fire and my friend put it out - waitresses didn't even know (figure we would get at least a thanks)
They dropped a fork on her shoulder - wouldn't admit it
Took 1/2 an hour to get the check - they were fighting over the tip from the bday party
We had to go over and ask
Wine was nice - but the hanger steak was chewy
Wouldn't go back - wasn't worth the money
we ordered the filet mignon and a bottle of cab
We received a delicious, extremely tender steak, with tastey squash and 'pommes anna', and an excellent wine to wash it all down
This place is a great little(literally) package - food, service, setting
They made the most of a tiny space
I'm definitely looking forward to returning, exploring more of their menu
Merci CamaJe!
Even though we live in Greenwich with all the hundreds of restaurants to try, we keep coming back to Camaje, and bring out-of-towners there
The place is just perfect for any occasion, and never too crowded
The food is great
I particularly like the side dishes -- the eggplant dip, for example -- and the appetizers
The soups are just delicious, and the menu is always evolving to reflect each season
The staff is also very friendly and laid back
When we got our check, it seemed high
I audited it and discovered that service charges had been included
The waiter then explained that a service charge of 17% had been added to the AFTERTAX amount (or 20% of the pretax amount)
She then said this was standard
We were not amused, especially since we were only a party of four and hadnt been warned in advance
She then explained that it was Halloween night, that there were a lot of freaks around, that she was the only waiter and that this was a way of protecting herself
Huh? First of all, we didnt look crazy
We were dressed professionally in fact
Second, the fact that she was the only waiter was not our fault
We endured slow service due to the short staffing and then were asked to pay for it through a hefty service charge
Nice Halloween trick!
Mixed emotions about this place
Good food, but bad service
Avoid appetizers/sides/souffle as they are way overpriced
$6
50 for a 3 oz
serving of grocery store Kielbasa? PLEASE! Entres delicious and well priced
$8 for a 3 oz
chocolate souffle! Every other souffle I've had was larger and cost less, even at expensive restaurants
$7
50 for a 4 oz
glass of Chilean wine? A bit much
At the end of the night, my mother-in-law asked for a copy of the receipt for business expensing
The waitress copped an attitude and said Well, we don't give itemized reciepts
All businesses will accpet that (the stub of a diner-type order ticket with nothing more than the total price for all three of us) Excuse me, but I think I know what my business will accept
How hard is it to give us a proper receipt? What happened to servicing the customer????
Make reservations - the place is small, and cozy, but that also means there aren't enough tables to make it a good bet thatyou can walk in and be seated! Still, it's worth it, as the meals and the waitstaff are simply wonderful
The food is precisely what it promises to be, while the price is right
Definite recomendation for a cozy, non-glitzy night in the Village
great place to have very good food and wine with a zero stress athmosphere
you can hang out ojn the couches
should be more camaje's
I could not have been happier with the decision to host a birthday dinner at Camaje
The staff is wonderful, accomodating and laid back
The ambiance is so charming, the food was excellent and we had the best chocolate birthday cake which was prepared for us
They really make you feel like each plate was made specifically for you
The Scene It is always night in a W hotel, especially this one, with its catchy play list, dim lighting, and staff all dressed in black

Most of the complaints here have to do with service, and it is plausible that there would be some bad experiences as it is the kind of place that gets cramped and crowded quickly
I'd advise coming in off-peak hours
My new favorite Manhattan Italian
(PS there is also a very affordable wine list)
What prices! Most pasta dishes less than 10 bucks--and they are very large portions
Salads (about $7
00), equally very large
Pizzas (about ($8
00)--good thin crust baked in a wood-burning oven
Ingredients for all are well-above standard
At these prices, turn-over and maximizing seating is essential; which must be why some reviewers complain about not being seated when they arrive with missing members of their party
The menu is incredibly long
There are so many pasta dishes to choose from
I highly recommend the fettuccine pescatore
it's excellent
The wait staff is very helpful and friendly
The restaurant has a very casual atmosphere
It's very small and brightly lit inside, so it's not the most romantic place in the world
Still, the food is super yummy
I am not a huge fan of Italian food but I love this restaurant! I discovered this through a co-worker and now I take all my out of town friends when they come
The menu is huge, so many choices, the prices are extremely reasonable and the food is consistently good
Not to mention, their desserts - especially the hazelnut tartufo - is to die for! I highly recommend this restaurant
I've been going to this place for years
The owner and staff are extremely friendly
The negative comments about the staff are unwarrented
They have their seating guidelines, I assume because of the small size and high volume
Patrons must respect a restrauants policies
I have never had a rude word spoken to me from anyone there
I always take my out of town visitors there as well as business clients for lunch
Great food, great atmosphere, great people
I used to love Il Corallo just because it reminded me so much of Italy itself
I fell in love with the food so much so that I could taste it last week as I rushed up Prince Street to meet friends
One friend was stuck in traffic and the staff, one lady in particular, was incredibly rude not wanting to seat us
After realizing that our friend was stuck deep in traffic we asked for a glass of wine while we waited and were told,No! There's a bar across the street We took ourselves not only out across the street but never to return to that Il serviced-establishment!
We arrived and asked to be seated, explaining that a fifth person would be joining us shortly
The hostess refused us the available table, saying that we'd have to wait
I am disabled, and showed her my leg brace
No problem she said and pointed me to two chairs in a tiny hallway in the back
When I sat down there I discovered that I was directly across from the open men's room door
A friend opened the door next to me to give us a little fresh air and the hostess came and slammed it shut
Our fifth friend arrived and we were told that, now, there would be a twenty minute wait
We moved to the front of the restaurant to get away from the restrooms and were told, most rudely, that we were in the way
We left
Il Corallo was my worst restaurant experience ever!
I've been here a couple of times and everytime I go, I always come back again
The food is delightful, and delicious
The dishes are big and the menu lists forever
Also, during lunch time they offer a Lunch Special menu which is wonderful
This is by far my favorite place
Chose this place at random while walking around SoHo and we were very pleased
It is small and crowded, but the atmosphere is very Italian
We were a party of five and were seated right away without a reservation
The menu is very long and has has almost too many choices
The antipasti we ordered were great and each of the entrees was exceptional
We didn't order pizza, but they had a good selection and they looked good
This was better than anything I've had in Little Italy or almost anywhere
On top of it all, it was very inexpensive
The same group had eaten at another Italian restaurant the night before and the bill here was half what it was there
This quaint Italian restaurant is one of my personal favorites
The staff is always warm and friendly
The menu selection is extensive and everything my friends and I have ordered has always been absolutely delicious
The food is great, portions are perfect (not huge and not tiny) - all very reasonably priced
This is definitely a great place to go with friends or on a casual date
i love this place!i got free drinks and free desert! get friendly with the owner and she will give u star treatment!
They crowd everyone together in the front even though half the restaurant was empty
My friend and I not wanting to jump over people to get to the table our waiter told us to sit at ask if we could sit at another table-pointing at an empty table
he rudely said NO
They weren't even reserved tables they were just empty
He offered another table which if we sat there we would be bumping elbows with the people at the next table
He threw the menus on that table and I took my seat at the table I wanted to sit at
He grabbed the menu from me and threw it at the table he wanted us to sit at
We walked out since I can't t tolerate such rudeness
There are tons of italian restaurants in manhattan so no need to go here
The service is HORRIBLE
My boyfriend brought me here 2 years ago, and I fell in love with the first bite
The menu is quite long with delicious options on each page
The hostess is excellent and promptly seats you
The staff is very accomodating and prompt
And the prices!! It is very rare in Manhattan that 2 can easily eat a meal for less than $50 (incl
wine) and the food actually tastes good
The place is cozy, some call it cramped and loud, but if you've ever been to a real trattoria in Italy, this place is the real deal
Talk about an inexpensive meal
Who says you can't get a good, cheap meal in Manhattan? You certainly can at Il Corallo Trattoria
I have never been disappointed with my meal -- everything I have tried has been excellent
The servers have always been very helpful and prompt
The tiramisu was amazing
There is a great menu selection, as well
this small reasonably priced trattoria in mostly expensive area has some of the best pastas around
Quality of food are at the level of good trattorias in trestevre area of rome (area filled with good old italian restaurants
)  Pescatore is superb anytime, Lemon sauce is done just right, tagniali is also another good choice
Fresh, done right pastas, strong pizza, and great salads at reasonable price makes this place one of my favorite place in the area
Service is average/good, the place is pretty cramped(just like many trattorias in italy or in manhattan)
Hope they just stay the way they currently are forever
(so i can enjoy going there forever)  well
maybe they have some room to improve on their daily special menu
The food was really good and they have really good prices
try the pasta with peas, mushroom and prosciutto
to die for
I didn't expect this restaurant to have good prices
would not go there again

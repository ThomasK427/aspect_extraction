not a very big place but good soho feel
it's a little loud though the food is also quite good
the appetizers are good
and so actually is the cuban sandwich
worth checking out
I had a birthday dinner at Ideya last Saturday night and it was great
The pitchers of mojitos were a nice touch, and perfect for a group
Everything was great
the food, the ambience
it's definitely a cool place that is worth checking out
Came her over the summer for friends
In a nutshell
Come for drinks and eat somewhere else
The food was average here, but the drinks are supberb
Food servers were not very good either
Stay at the bar
I had my b-day party @ Ideya ( on a recommendation from a friend who has been going there for 4 years) and my whole party had such a great time
Our waiter stated us off with pitchers of mojitos and sangria and some plantain chips that were out of this world! The food was excellent, incredible, fantastic- even my difficult vegertarian sister was loving it
I had a flan for dessert (wowwowwow), and it was a perfect evening
I was so grateful to the staff and the host
they really made my whole party feel welcome and part of their family
After years of terrible b-days (bad service, iffy food) I really lucked out @ Ideya restaurant
Great food
A bit cramped, but the mojitos are worth the discomfort!
Ideya was a pleasant surprise for us
We wondered in off the street and were surprised to find such a warm pleasant environment
We tried the drink sampler which saved us from actually ordering one of the and were worried about how the food would turn out
The food was unbelievable
We ordered the cod cakes, baked chicken and Cuban sandwich
Not one of the disappointed us at all
I am looking forward to returning
this should not be listed under romantic, food was good, but a major let down for a romantic date! Great place to go with friends
The host was extremely accomodating with our forever increasingly large group of friends that kept coming in last night
The food was very tasty, though, like another review stated, the portions were a little small
We did have to return a drink because it didn't seem like any alcohol was in it, but overall, they were accomodating and the food was great -- the fried plantain chips salsa were DELICIOUS!
Food was good, but the portions were small
Very good ambience, specially when the salsa band plays
Service was good also, with very corteous staff
My biggest problem is the overall value, since the portions are tiny and the prices are very high
Ever since a friend brought me to Ideya almost 2 years ago, it has been on of my favorite places to bring out of towners or meet friends on a Sunday afternoon
Everything about Ideya is great
The food, the drinks, the service, and the atmosphere
It's a win, win situation
A happy place!!!
The food was cold (though I imagine if it were warm, it might've had more taste)
The drinks were weak and watery
And the hostess was overly and unneccesarily rude/snooty/with attitude
About the best I can say is that the waiters were cute (and they were!)
I'm an architecture student from Mexico City and me and my friends from Mexico, Germany and Poland accidentally ended in this restaurant while walking through SoHo
The truth is we were starving and the looks of the place were eye catching enough to invite us in
The result was astonishing
These guys really knew how to pull out the essence of Latin America but in a contemporary style
The place is cozy, esthetically pleasing and the meal was lush !! 100% recommendable
the best someone can deserve to eat in new york
The first legitimate caipirinha in Nueva York! My boyfriend opted for the caipriosca, and we munched on these plantain chips and mango salsa, until we HAD to eat something
I recommend the grilled prawns w/ cilantro pesto and the taquitos (which were stuffed with seafood in a chile sauce)
A great little spot for appetizers and drinks-- the vibe was super suave, but nice
The waiter kept us in good supply of drinks, and was helpful with recommendations
It seemed like he knew everybody who walked in the door-- obviously a regulars sort of place
Was refreshing to have such a warm atmosphere WITHOUT SoHo pretension
How did I ever miss this place?! It's definatley my new Friday nite spot!
Stumbled onto this gem after a friend told me they make the best mojitos in new york-- she wasn't kidding
It was a Monday, and there was a Salsa band playing and people were dancing-- I felt like I was back in Puerto Rico! The staff was warm, like it was a big familia
but the food (O dios mio) I had the Argentinean steak, she had the roasted chicken with yuca and I was in heaven
Try some of the other drinks too-- they had some hilarious cocktails called the Miami Nice collection, and needless to say I was up there dancing before the end of the nite! Island paradise
Ideya's MO becomes clear when you arrive - get your patrons drunk and they won't notice the shortcomings
The host, though polite, told us he was doing us a favor by seating us in place of a party that was 15 minutes late - even though it was 40 minutes AFTER our reservation
The service was snotty and slow - 4 visits in 90 minutes
The food was wretched - all spice and no flavor (which is more important in Ginger Tuna, the ginger or the tuna?)
On the plus side - the drinks were strong and the presentation (clearly designed to make up for the quality of the food and disguise the fact that the portions are tiny) was good
Other than that - don't waste your time
1 star because it's not MacDonalds, 1 star for the greasy fried plantains, 1 star for the presentation
I've been to Oro Blue many times and it is a very nice restaurant
I'm from out of town and when I visit NY, this is where I go for dinner and/or lunch
The food is exceptional
especially the garlic spinach (my favorite)
The service is great
The ambiance is very nice
Friday nites are fun with karaoke
The owner Steve is a very nice and personable person
I would highly recommend this restaurant, whether with a group, or a quiet romantic dinner
Quite an amazing night we had on Friday night
Once we stepped inside the restaurant, amient was just so great
They had their DJ playing nice romantic background music while we're having a dinner
Food and the service were both incredible
For a starter, we had a Hot Antipasto, secret menu of this restaurant that was recommended by a waiter
Jumbo Shrimp, Clams, Mussels, a tons of fresh seafood
For Main course, we had Lobster Ravioli, the best Ravioli I've ever had in NYC
Try it out!!
The place is all right, but one waiter in particular, completely ruined the evening
Jerk would be the nicest word to describe him
And this is coming from a former server
Until they loose people like him, you won't find me going back
Had the pleasure of dining here with wife on Valentines Day
A friend recommended it, I'm glad I listened
Food was delicious, services was excellent, overall had a wonderful evening
They had nice music playing which added to the ambiance
Waters, bartender, hostess were all very nice
There is also plenty of street parking as well
I would highly recommend this restaurant!! The Lobster Ravioli was absolutely delicious! We dined there last week and found the experience totally enjoyable

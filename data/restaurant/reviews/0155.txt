I wasn't in the mood for gruffy service at Gallagher's, Sparks, etc and it was 7pm on a Friday night in NYC with no reservations (LOL)
Del Frisco's happily took our reservation for 9pm, seated us on time, and the service was truly exceptional
I have traveled the country on business for 20 years, and I dare say the service here is in the top 3 *ever*
Oh, and the steaks were outstanding! Right up there with Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etc
The kicker was the waitress asked us for a business card, and actually sent a thank you card a week later -- real classy!
By far, top 5 steakhouses in the city
I would definitely reccommend it
I even went one year for Valentines Day because we wanted the best steak possible
Brought my parents here for a special occasion
All their dishes were excellent
Only downside is that the restaurant gets crowded, especially the bar therefore, it can be noisy and service slightly slow
Dinner for four was well worth it
Excellent atmosphere, great food and tremendous service
The crab cakes and steaks were fabulous along with the potatoes au gratin
Dessserts were awesome
This is one of the most outstanding steak houses i've ever been to
The wait staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable, as well as the ambience of the restaurant
Check it out, you will not be disappointed
Just had my first Del Frisco's experience and surely not my last! The filet was awesome and cooked to perfection
A lovely view and the mult-level restaurant reeked of banker power
The waitstaff was adequate (although we had to refill our own wine glasses when the time came)
Great for groups and large parties
Del Frisco is one of the great New York City steakhouses
The atmosphere is dramatic with the 2 story foor-to-ceiling windows
The place hums!! The VIP martinis are the best
Steaks are huge and done just right
Side dishes are delicious and massive
Felix Albano is a terrific maitre'd
We are always made to feel very welcome here and have never been disappointed in any way
This is a destination dining spot
I just love it here!! Keep it up!
I love eating in a place where I'm not sitting on top of the next table
This alone is worth the slightly inflated prices
My porterhouse steak is perfectly cooked medium rare every time
Make sure your table companions like to eat the same side dish as you as they will NOT split a side dish which is big enough for three people
All in all this playce blows SW, Gallaghers, Palm and Sparks out of the water
The steak at Del Frisco's is great
On par with the Palm, Smith and Wollensky and Luger's
The appetizers are very good also
Unfortunately, the sides and the desserts are mediocre at best, and the Wine List is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced (3x retail prices)
My friends and I can get out of any other NY steakhouse for $80-100 a head
Del Frisco's cost us $125 each
Wouldn't go back without an expense account
Went to Del Frisco's for my birthday on Saturday night and must tell that it was a wonderful dinner
From the decor to the service it was a 10 and more
The waitstaff was helpful with my party of 12 and the food was cooked to perfection
It was my second time there and I knew that I was not going to be dissapointed
It's pricey but it you pay for what you get and that is a beautiful expirence
Thank you Del Frisco's
This is one of my favorite restaurants
The filet is amazing, and when I ask for medium rare but more on the rare side that is exactly how I get it, it is never overdone (a problem I have had at some other popular steak houses)
The side dishes are the best I have ever had, specifically the cheddar potatoes au gratin and the creamed spinach (with bacon!)
Once, our food was brought out late so they gave us each a complimentary dessert, the praline sundae is one of my favorites and the creme brulee and lemon cake are delicous
Good wine selection
Everything we ordered was GREAT
From the appetizers to the steaks to the dessert
Pineapple martini was average though
What a joke
loud, overpriced, intrusive managers (not professional)
this place could be so much more with space
my clients and i finished our steaks before the sides arrived
to bad, but i'll be taking them elsewhere next time
Ridiculous prices are well worth the overtime at work for the best food in midtown
Fasting for a month is highly suggested, for the portions are huge
The avocado dressing is delicious, especially with the building-block size croutons
Save room for the lemon cake, which I adored even though I typically despise lemony desserts
At first, you'll think you order a wedge of cheddar, due to the square footage of the slice
Not a casual eatery (in regards to calories, anyway!), I'd recommend it for special occasions
In a city packed with steakhouses, Del Frisco's holds its own
The service is excellent, as is the quality of the food
There is plenty of room around each table, which is a unique feature of a New York restaurant
If you don't get red meat here, you should have your head examined -- or at least go to another restaurant
And don't forget to get the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin
Despite being called a chain these guys delivered one of the best steaks I have had in years
The serivice was great and the wine was fantastic
g
this place rocks
The wait staff is totally attentive and great
The Cernobyl sized lobster tails, were grrreat! The cajun spiced rib-eye (have to ask for it as it's not on the menu) is perfectly balanced to bring otu what that prime beef has to offer
Spinach supremee is an angioplasty waiting to happen but silky good
This place has totally taken up the slack that SW gave in this town since they remodelled
The chocolate mousse special when they offer it is great
Lemon cake is divine as well
This place was recommended to me by someone of significance in the restauant business when I told him I wanted a great steak place
I was surprised, as it had never come up on my reaturant radar
I've been to most of the noteworthy steak houses and never heard this place mentioned
I was skeptical
Well, this is a great steak place
This is the kind of place you come to when you want a killer steak, a gorgeous wine and a cigar (in their cigar lounge)
It is now one of my 3 favorite NYC steakhouses- Peter Luger's and Strip House being the others
Best of all, it's huge- and you can usually get a table
Del Friscos is a great Steakhouse, but keep in mind that it is a chain
The waiters are trained and the menu is generic, but the food is good
I had a filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly and it was very nicely seasoned
We also had asparagus and and creamed spinach
These were good, but nothing special
The service was incredible and out waitress was so attentive and nice
The restaurant itself is very attractive as well
The cocktails are also mixed well
Big place- soaring ceilings and great food

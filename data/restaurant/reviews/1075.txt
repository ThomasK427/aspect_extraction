Because Franny's is a small restaurant, be prepared to wait when it's busy
Since Brooklyn has good Pizzerias all over (Grimaldi's, Totonno's, LB, and DiFara's), it's tough to say if Franny's is simply the best given the various pizza styles (i
e
: LB's square pie)
Personally, I like Grimaldi's just a little better
But Frannys is up there
While Frannys appetizers and desserts are also very good, the main attraction is the pizza
Points are taken off for the rushed service when it's busy (i
e
: taking my drink before I finish it completely) and the very expensive prices for relatively small portions of food
Frannys is definately great for a couple on a date- they have pretty great pizza and delicious appetizers; however, the service confuses me
Sometimes, the servers and other business people there are helpful and kind, other times, i have found them crabby and harshly unkind (and for what reason??)
The price is not worth the whole deal though
It is way too expensive, albeit quite tasty--- for the size, servings, quality
Truly, i sometimes eat there- but always take out because of the poor service i have received
An attempt to be innovative gone a bit too far
If you are looking for great, basic pizza - this may not be the place for you
The desserts, however, are outstanding! Good atmoshere and service
I was happy when Franny's opened b/c I though that it would be cool to have a fancy pizza place right next to your house
I've been there 2 times and I'm not willing to try anymore! The first time the service was awful but the food was good, nothing special but good
Actually I think the appetizers are pretty good
The second time I went it was a total disaster!!!! I almost cried when I saw my boyfriend's white pizza black! and mine was burned as well
I think the waiters wanted to leave b/c it wasn't a lot of people and they made us feel really uncomfortable! It was awful
I won't try again!
After reading so much about Franny's, I was extremely excited to experience the hype
To be sure, I was not disappointed! There was a fairly long wait (understandable for a friday night), but it was made pleasant by the friendly staff and fabulous bar service
BY the time we sat down, my party was ravenous
and Franny's delivered
The food was incredible
I had one of the best preparations of baccala (salt cod) in my life- served in a mouth watering gratin with creamy kale
The cured meats were outstanding- and the provologne pizza with roasted onions will keep me dreaming until my next visit
Yes, it can be pricey- but true new York foodies are willing to pay for quality
Our server was incredible- and seemed to know everything about Italian cuisine and wine- impressing two of my dining companions who work in the restaurant industry
delicious
always fresh ingredients
the food is simple and the flavors are amazing
their house cured meats are among the best in the city
never had a problem with the service
maybe had to wait a little while, but it's a busy restaurant
besides, it's a comfortable place to be and the staff is very friendly
definately worth checking out
Very disappointing
I was hoping the pizza lived up to the no cutting the pizza, no substitutions snootiness, it didn't
The dough was tasty, ingredients fresh, but not enough sauce or toppings
If they believe the pizza is so good that you cannot make any substitutions, it should have been amazing
There are many better pizza places in New York
Living right around the corner, I've been to Franny's more times than I can count
And every time, it's been spectacular
Other reviews have commented on the service; I've never had a problem
The servers have always been enthusiastic and knowledgable, and any server is happy to help you, whether they took your order or not
But the food
oh, the food! The pizza is heavenly
The appetizers are constantly interesting and delicious
The wine is always first-rate, and though they only have three beers on tap, they always seem to be exactly what I want
The host or hostess is always smiling, and even if they can't seat you right away, they are good about letting you know what the status is
It is a little cramped, but what place in NYC isn't? Give Franny's a chance
It's worth it
Good pizza, but the appetizers are really the standout
If only there were a few additional entree options--some pastas or salads, maybe--for when pizza's just not what you want
This is a treasure on a down and out strip of Flatbush Ave
in Prospect Heights
Most of the pizzas are just right, although the clam one seems to be about salt and burned crust
Do try the ever-changing crostini with such toppings as slow cooked summer beans or an intense tuna concentrate
The vegetable and seafood appetizers, like fried zucchini with blossoms and squid with a green herb and onion salsa, are never disatisfying
The garden is always breezy and the front of the main room is always comfortable; but do try not to get a table near the boiling hot open kitchen, which also happens to be near the bathroom
And, the special cocktails are amazing
This summer they have a Green Market Gin and Tonic, which comes with a heirloom radish, slices of local cucumber and a sprig of Italian parsley, yum
Simply some of the best pizza I've ever had; gives Patsy's a run for its money
I've had the garlic and mozzarella, fennel sausage and clam toppings--all fantastic
Also, the only restaurant where I can find a sweet, sparkling red wine
Help staff could not be friendlier
They make a mean panne cotta as well
Rustic Italian food prepared with amazingly fresh ingrediants from local producers- brought by friendly, educated servers with impressive food and wine knowledge
True- if you want cheap pizza and inexpensive chianti- maybe you should try an establishment that cares less about both the presentation and flavor of the dishes served
This place is for those with distinguished tastes who love food and those who know how it should be prepared
I can't ask for anything more when I dine out
It is no wonder that many of NYC's press has written about Franny's
The garden is fantastic
I felt like I was in a piazza in Italy
This place has a refined rustic feel and great food
It's a bit procey but everything is delicious
eating at franny's is like being in italy in a cozy trattoria
the food is amazing
there is a new menu every night
the salads are very interesting and the pizzas are melt in your mouth delicious
my favorites are the clam pizza and the mushroom pizza
all the meats are cured on the premises as well
the waitstaff is very knowledgeble and very attentive
franny's is our favorite stop in brooklyn
I've been to Franny's now several times, as it's extremely convenient and I really want to love it
Unfortunately, Franny's seems hell-bent on losing my support
I agree with the many posters addressing an oppressively aggressive waitstaff, and I'm in particular support of the review directed at Franny's bizarrely adamant refusal to cut pizza (or provide adaquate knives/plates for us to do it ourselves)
But mostly, I just don't think Franny's is that good
Of the maybe six pizzas I've tried, only the mushroom really made an impression, and at $14 for an appetizer-sized portion, I just can't recommend it - no matter how convenient
I've been to the restaurant a couple of times
The pizza pies are good but the waiting staff needs to IMPROVE
The other day, I was told on the phone that they provided takeout pizza
When I got to the restaurant, the waitress informed me that takeout at the particular time I arrived is not available because they are too busy
I informed her that I had been told just twenty minutes ago on the phone that takeout service was available
She in turn informed me that takeout is available, so long as the restaurant is not too busy to accommodate takeouts

food was average
liked the ambience
Better if you get a table with a booth
I have been to Jane several times for brunch and have yet to be disappointed
I have eaten in the dining room and the bar and both have great service! The service is always good, waitstaff pleasant, atmosphere inviting, and food amazing! The portions are huge
feel free to share
And the banana chocolate bread pudding
to die for!
A group of 7 of us went to Jane for Thanksgiving Dinner
The server was noticeably unhappy, not in the holiday spirit at all
Our food arrived COLD
when sent back, it returned COLD but the plates were hot
The main course was awful - Especially the Turkey
Turkey was tastier at my Hospitals' cafeteria! The desserts were eh, ok
But two of us were not even served dessert
And they added 20% tip, so were unable to pay for the service that was given to us
The side dishes were very good as were the appetizers
The restaurant looks nice upstairs, however, we were sat downstairs by the kitchen (which makes it even more surprising that our food was cold)
I will not return
Plenty of people were sitting outdoors and inside only a few
The hostess sat us all the way in the back towards the kitchen when there was plenty of room towards the front
We couldn't really admire the restaurant from the back as the only view we had was the kitchen
We ordered the fettuccini and I ordered the lamb
When the food came, it was only the fettuccini and our server told me that it was going to be a few more minutes because the lamb takes about 20 minutes to cook
It was about 10pm and I haven't eating anything since lunch
If the server would have told me that it was going to take that long, infact longer because I send it back because it was still raw inside
Besides that, our server was attentive and the ambience was only ok
The fettucini was delicious
very dissapointing
bland food
pretentious host
sloppy very dissapointed good beverages though
and the lighting was interesting not worth the time
maybe brunch is better
I wish they hadn't sat us right by the kitchen, but if you look beyond that the experience was great
Decent wine list, food was prepared well, and service was adequate
Not far from a great local bar, MercBar
Jane + MercBar = great nite
Undoubtedly the best restaurant Houston St
has to offer
Pricey than the average Sunday brunch so go when guests are in town
We have been there for brunch several times and have always loved it
So, last Wednesday, a group of us decided to try it for dinner
We were more than just satisfied
Our reception at the door was warm and friendly, and the open space and simple design looked great at night
The service was a little more formal and refined at dinner, but just as helpful and friendly
The food was great, especially the roasted pig with grilled apples
The cocktails were great and we can't wait to go back!
I was very glad to see that we were seated promptly and then served by a very enthusiastic waitress
The food was great but the only down part was that the main dish would only be filling enough for light/medium eaters
Other than that, this experience was quite enjoyable
I have been to Jane a number of times over the past several years and each time it provides a consistently good level of service and food
There is plenty of room between tables, a good cocktail list and plates that please - from fish to meat
It also seems to have a nice-sized private room as well
I went to Jane on New Years Day based on reviews from Citysearch, and after doing so, I am afraid to use this website for recommendations
Upon making reservations we were not informed of the price fixe menu for New Year's brunch, which was okay, but still, the food was subpar, the potatoes were day old dry, the french toast order was huge but twenty dollars for french toast is a joke in itself
Our waiter asked if we would like some fresh strawberries and bananas on the french toast ($20 french toast remember) and after being charged an extra $3, we received about two sliced strawberries and no bananas
Extremely overhyped, and while this review is based solely on New Year's, at this point, I would never chance this restaurant again
this place is amazing! The martini's are absolutely delicious
I had the proscuitto wrapped seared tuna that has been a benchmark for great tuna ever since
nothing has matched it! Our server was also great - made perfect recommendations and was very nice
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants
Now I know why this place is always packed
The brunch was the best I've ever had
Jane's Benedict was out of this world and my rose mary (bloody mary) was the best I've ever had
I highly recommend this place for brunch before hitting Soho for shopping
Just remember a reservation
With so many restaurants to choose from this one serves up great food, polite and attentive servers make dining in this comfortable restaurant a pleasure - I would definitely go again
The food at this place is just like the name: no frills and down-to-business
Everything we tasted was so tasty and the seafood was so fresh
Each platter had something interesting about it
What's amazing is that you can have such a great meal (interesting bread included) for a reasonable price
What a fantastic find!
Visited Jane with my husband yesterday for a birthday brunch
We were seated promptly in spite of the fact that they were super busy (it was mother's day)
The bloody mary was generous in size and spice, service was attentive and food was solid
I tried the eggs benedict that was made with homemade chicken sausage; sausage was too gamey for me - reminded me of pate
Also, like many NYC restaurants, the tables for two are jammed really close together; there is no such thing as a private conversation
Other than that we had a great time
This is favorite spot for lunch for me
The service is ALWAYS pleasant, and the food is great
The music is terrific, and the atmosphere comfortable
I have only one reqeust -- I'm 5 feet 4 inches, not terribly short, but if you're sitting by the wall, on the cushy bench, my chest comes up to the table -- I have to sit on at least one bag and/or coat to feel comfortable
Not an awful thing, but a little awkward
If for no other reason, you have to visit Jane for the bread
It's an experience on its own
The ambience is great; food was good
My steak was a little charred, and the sorbets are horrible
You can taste the artificial flavoring
But all in all, I would recommend Jane for a pleasant dining experience
I recently went to Jane and made a 7:30 p
m
reservation on a Sunday
I waited for 10 minutes and had a couple that came after me without a reservation get seated before I left Jane
What's the point of making a reservation if they are not going to seat you and seat people who came after you without a reservation? Jane is not very professional or courteous
I would not recommend Jane, besides you can go to other NY resturants with better service that have a much higher Zagat ratings and still pay the same amount
Jane is over-rated
Service was good and so was the atmosphere
MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the fish was very average
Took my blind date to Jane last Sunday

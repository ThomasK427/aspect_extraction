The waitstaff was particularly attentive, although in true European fashion, one has to let the waiter know when you are ready to order and when you are ready for the check
The food was delicious, sauces were flavorful without being overpowering and the pasta was perfectly al dente
The restaurant has a very romantic ambiance, perfect for a cozy dinner with friends or a nice date
Highly recommended!
Not much to recommend - ordered 2 appetizers and a pasta dish and there was really nothing special about any of it
The restaurant decor is average
Prices are OK but Raymond's is a nothing to write home about experience
Better choices abound in the neighborhood
Raymond's would be a fine choice in a smaller city but by NYC standards there are better options
Raymond's Cafe is an unpretentious and reasonably price neighborhood restaurant and bar
The attractive bar has a weekly neighborhood following and the dining is simply well prepared food, good service, and a comfortable and inviting decor
Seafood lovers, try the filet of sole almondine, an exceptional value
I went in there for dinner one night, just to get something quick
It turns out the staff was really charming and the Salmon was to die for!! I'm very fussy about my fish, but Raymond's made it just the right way
I definitely plan on going back more often
I have to agree with the reviewer who thumbed down the pasta; not much spark there
But if you know what to order you'll be in comfort food heaven
Try the liver
Really
It's not what you're expecting, unless you're expecting a miraculous piece of meat that dissolves on your tongue and gives you a euphoric buzz
Next in line for culinary bliss: the duck (ask for it the old way), the sweetbreads, and the steak from a chef who knows the meaning of rare! try either the crabmeat au gratin or the artichoke for an app
Skip dessert and walk downtown to get a cup of coffee that can defend itself
I've probably eaten at Raymond's twice a week for seven years and for consistency of food, service and friendliness, there is no equal
A 4 Star restaurant it is not but for quality, price and service - it's the best for my money!
Went there for an early dinner, when there were about 6 other customers in the restaurant
Despite the non-rush, the empty tables all around us were not bussed for quite a while
The bread was swaddled in a cold, damp napkin, and was itself hard and cold
The pasta with smoked salmon and dill sauce had absolutely no dill in the sauce, it was merely an alfredo
When we asked the waiter about it, he refused to ask the cook, saying the cook would just insist that the dill was in the sauce
The waiter also confided that the mixed greens in their salads were iceberg
In a city filled with competitive restaurants, why would you bother going to one who clearly skimps on food, service, and caring?
The garlic soup tasted strange
The cruttons on it had been fried on stale oil
The paella was a total desgrace: the rice was dry, had no azafrn but tomatoe, the chorizo had been sliced and was the worse you could find, the seafood was overcooked
One good thing: the service had been good and very friendly, though not wise on wine recommendation
Then the check arrived: they had charged us 40 extra bucks out of nothing
Our waiter tried to explain that the house never writes down the alcoholic beverages on the bill (????!!!!)
We insisted it was wrong, and of course it was
After long waiting and no longer friendly faces, as I said it was 40 less than they had planned to charge us
We will never again show up our noses there,nor our poor mouths and less our wallet
My date took me to this place for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised! The decor is not modern/trendy like Taj, but more down to earth, spanish style
The waiters were absolutely fabulously always being attentive such as filling water/sangria
=) The food, I thought was excellent! The paella is HUGe, maybe serving up to 4 people
The seafood paella was great
The appetizers, the most expensive one with a variety of different seafoods, sausages was absolutely, ridiculous, yummy! after the appetizer, I was so full, I couldn't contain myself
The fliet mignon/lobster/shrimp dish was also wonderful, very large portions for this price in NYC
At the end of the mean, i wanted to cry because I was so full
One thing, if you want a medium well, you should ask for medium
If you want medium, ask for medium rare, etc
The vege paella consisted of overly boiled vegetables and loose rice- it completely lacked flavor
The museels were okay, but overall this place was very disappointing
Friends had salmon and grouper and no one could enjoy his meal
although some of the dishes were on the salty side, the prices and portions can't be beat
the servers,busboys, hostess
just everyone at the restaurant were all smiles and so down to earth
we never had to summon our waiter because he took care of things right away without us having to ask
really wonderful for large parties
the entrees takes awhile to come out so try to order appetizers
just a really great experience overall
El Quijote is the 1# place for seafood, especially the large perfectly steamed lobster! I've been frequenting the place for over 20 years and much to my amazement things have stayed consistanly the same, TOP OF THE LINE
Birthdays are a special treat when the wait staff delivers their rendition of Happy Birthday in their signature baratone style
Everyone is happy and enjoys a good time
Don't forget that sangria and top if off with the best coffee in NY!
This is a great seafood restaurant, authentic sangria red/white
The menu has tons of selections
But lobsters are the way to go here
We love this place
The eclectic decor, the tasty (and very intoxicating!) sangria, the wonderful service (they bring you your food on a rolling cart!), and the value
The lobster is always priced right, and the servings are enormous
we ordered filet mignon, and the plate had TWO! Couples should request to wait for a booth, it's worth the wait
this place is great
it's such a fun place to come with a couple of friends and eat and eat! get a variety of dishes and share, there's more than enough food for everyone
order a couple of pitchers of sangria and enjoy
nothing fancy or pretentious about this place
wait staff always have a smile and are helpful
do make reservations or come early as the restaurant fills up quickly and remains so
they also have a bar in front where you can sit and wait for your table
I've been to this restaurant 3 times and the atmosphere is excellent and the food is delicious
They sing at your table
it can be a romantic place
I would recommend making reservations becaue it can become crowded
I have eaten at El Quijote many times and have always loved eating at this place
The food is consistently good and the service is courteous and fast
The Paella is always good but I recommend the stuffed shrimp
Very crowded after 7pm and very noisy
Definitely not a place for romance and tintillating conversation over the noise,but man oh man the food! Delicious and plentiful
You will be too busy wolfing down the food to care about talking! Make sure to try the house salsa condiment with your chips as the appetizer
You will be craving it for the rest of the week and will ask them to bottle the stuff for you to take home or at least market it! I have been here several times and have yet to be disappointed
I highly recommend this place!
I have lived in Chelsea for most of my 38 years and have frequented El Quijote at least 100 or more times
I have never had a bad meal, I have never suffered bad service
From the moment I walk in the door to the time I leave I know that I will have a great dining experience
The food is great the service better and there's not enough words to compliment the Sangria
I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and bring all my out of town visitors and have never heard a complaint
except that they would need help getting home after too much Sangria
!
i have never seen lobsters this big!!! they were so good and steamed perfectly
i could not belive how amazing they tasted
the service was friendly and it was just a fun and great place all around
oh! definitely have the sangria!!!

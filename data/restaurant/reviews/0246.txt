waitress had no clue
Went for lunch (2 people)
Extended periods of time needed for both cources to hit the table together
Wine pairings not showing up period
Food was very good but the poor service created stress and ruined the meal
Would not go back
Beppe was a great dining experience
My girlfriend and I celebrated our anniversary there, and were pleasantly suprised that we were seating upstairs in a corner table after requesting a quiet place to enjoy the occassion
The food, service, and wine list were excellent
Highly suggest trying the butcher's Spaghetti
One caution, diners must enjoy northern italian food
Overall, great place to try
Beppe is a unique Italian restaurant
The Farotto is always excellent as are all the pasta and fish entrees
I have been dining at Beppe for the past couple of years and it is consistently great
I have never been unsatisfied
I have been to Beppe's several times and I have never had a negative experience
The food brings a warm feeling to my heart
The service is great
I highly recommend Beppe to all of my friends and family whenever they are in the city
You won't be disappointed
I went in for a large family get together, and the waiter named James could not have been more helpful
and handsome! We tried a sampling of appetizers and pastas, and they were all delicious, we all needed a nap after such a good, satisfying meal!
We went by chance
Had a memorable lunch
Food was wonderful, the wine choices were exemplary and the service, honestly, was exceptional
I would love to return for a special dinner
Very enjoyable experience
The food was good to quite good
The service was nice and the decor is charming
The host knows his wine and the wine list shows
Also, the restaurant is on one of the best blocks in NYC
I'd definitely come back here and would recommend it to others
On a resurgent block of 22nd St sits a small Tuscan storefront with fresh rosemary, thyme, and mint growing outside
Compared to its trendier neighbors (Rocco's, Tamarind, Kitchen 22), this hushed northern italian quietly serves some of the best food in its category
Exposed brick walls and soft lighting make up the setting
The service was fine other than the drinks that came a bit late
The food more than compensated
The calamari was fresh and lightly breaded- I ate the left over bread crumbs
In a move atypical of myself at an italian joint, i went with lamb
Delicious
My sister chose opted for the ribs- delcious for a few bites, if not a bit too heavy
Other dishes worth sampling: zucchini flower, whole roasted fish
Even the coffee and biscotti assortment at the end were delicious
Many positives and fwe negatives
Would certainly go back
Visiting NYC and ate at Beppe last night with family
Food was fabulous -- the sausage in the dishes is the most flavorful we've eaten
Mussels were also tasty
Don't miss the Caldo for dessert -- molten chococolate, vanilla ice cream and bananas -- wonderful! Have already recommended this restaurant to a new found friend this morning
The menu is a 10, the food is a 6
It was a dissapointment because really everything on the menu looks great but just dosen't taste as good as you expect
I tried everybodys dishes at the table and experienced the same thing
There is really better italian at this price and i would say go elsewhere
Have been to this restaurant a number of times and, each time, it's a delight! Great Tuscan Italian with some truly unique dishes
The ribs (Yes, ribs) are great! Lots of garlic and a spicy tomato sauce make them a treat! The Norcino pasta dish (with tasty crumbled sausage) is fabulous! Appetizers and salads are numerous and very tasty
The wine list is extensive and provides a lot of choices that won't break your bank
And, in addition to the always good food, the night, my wife's birthday, was made all that much better by a wonderful server named Angela
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes
Service was superb
Will go back many times
Beppe definately is one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten in over the past year
It was like home-cooked meals right out of the oven
The service was polite and friendly
I ended up at this restaurant by mistake
It was the best mistake I ever made
The decor was warm and inviting
The service was superb (I spilt a glass of water, and before I could even turn around to find a waiter, two were there cleaning it up)
The food was delicious
I had a risotto style dish with duck
Phenominal
I highly recommend
Prices are on the high side, though
My family only goes to places like Beppe for occasions
Most of the time, the expensive restaurants in this city don't really live up to their hype or reputations
But in the case of Beppe, I would go back every night if I could afford it
A seasonally conscious menu listing extremely creative dishes made it it difficult to order in that everything looked good
I had the Tuscan ribs which dropped off the bone with ease
The service was very attentive but not annoying
The dining room is very cozy but also airy
Soothing browns and reds balance the giant fireplace
The restaurant is not quiet but has good noise
THIS IS THE TYPE OF RESTAURANT YOU WANT TO BE GREAT BUT IT ISN'T
THE PASTA IS  QUITE GOOD BUT THE MAIN COURSES ARE CLEARLY HIT OR MISS
THE ORATA WAS VERY GOOD BUT THE CHICKEN TERROCOTTA WAS TERRIBLE
DRIED OUT WITH NO TASTE
THE  DESSERTS ARE SO SO
GO, the food is amazing and the wines are exquisite
The waitors/actors also very handsome! IN THIS PLACE LA VITA E BELLLA!!
By all accounts Beppe should be great
However, on my first visit I was disappointed
First of all it's a great space (they need to get rid of the Fireplace and service area if they aren't going to use it) and the service was VERY friendly and efficient
An end of season tomatoe salad was excellent which was easy since they didn't need to do anything to it
A gnocchi app
was OK
A poultry dish had to be sent back to the kitchen because it was WAY over salted
Veal Lasagna was good but uninspired
I have higher expectations however, and hope that some of the negatives will be worked out by the kitchen
We just took a long trip to Italy and starting missing the wonderful food the second we got back
Beppe brought us a taste of what we were missing

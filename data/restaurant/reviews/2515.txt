Gospel Sunday can be a little loud
The service is a little slow
They didn't care much b
c
18% tips is included on each meal! Read the menu carefully so you do not double tips the waiters
Fried chicken was good, the sides are also great (yam sweet potatoes were yummy) Too bad there were no corn bread served
Overall a good experience
Try this place at least once
I went to Slyvia's today for Sunday Gospel Brunch with my boyfriend and his parents
Since they had never been to NY, we figured one of the places we would take them to eat is for Soul food
We were seated fairly quickly but not by the friendliest hostess I have encountered in NY
Once seated, and our waitress came over and took our drink and food order it was down hill from there
We never even received our beverages until after our meal came, when our food came part of our order was wrong and had to be returned
After getting our meal, it was just not good
I had pancakes with sausage, they tasted like ones from a box, heated in the microwave, no flavor and hard! The other members of my party thought there meals were just ok
At one point, we tried to get our waitresses attention and she ignored us and than we asked for more biscuits and never got them
I live in NY and there are SO MANY other great places to eat brunch
Do not get caught up in this tourist trap, you are bound to be disappointed
As a a resident of harlem i know a thing or two about soul food, and this my friends is far from good
The service was horrible, the bathroom filthy, and the food wasnt good at all
The macaroni and cheese was flavorless, the greens tasted like they came from a can, and the catfish had a weird after taste
After a meal that wasnt what me and my boyfriend expected we sat for a HALF hour waiting to get the check
really
we timed it
I heard from friends it wasnt what it use to be, but since we were shopping on 125th we decided why not try it
well we found out why not
The worse thing was Sylvia was sitting right by us in a meeting, you would think the service would have been better =/
i went in for the first time
i had to look around to be helped
some of the staff was just sitting around talking to themselves, then the other staff all looked busy
that is my only complaint
I think the staff should organize better, and be more attentive to customers
Also decor could be a little nicer when you walk in
Food is good, its fairly priced, and you should try it
I go to Sylvia's for breakfast
I sit at the counter and not in the dining room
I love to soak up the ambience and talk to the regulars
When you sit at the counter, you pay less and get more
You might also have to wait a awhile, it's always crowded
The food is slamming
especially the biscuits, home fries and slab bacon
Talk about soul food, it puts a smile on my face
They have the best soul breakfast in New York
When I went to NYC, I made it a point to go to Sylvia's for dinner
I thought it was going to be some of the best food I had ever eaten
That was not the case
The food was okay, but not as good as all of the hype
Also, I the bought Sylvia's canned collard greens and it was more stems than greens
I will never buy them again
Flying from Little Rock, just to eat at the worl famous sylvia's was really a joke
The food was ok, except the mac and chesse was lumpy, cornbread too sweet, waitress not attentive and rushed, table too small, portions too small
margarita watered down, tto expensive for the portions
Any place would have been better
Went on a Saturday night in hopes of finding good soul food
Instead food was obviously served from a can and left something to be desired
Fried chicken was good
but how can you mess fried chicken up anyway? Stay away from the ribs
Mac Cheese was lumpy and barely warm
If I were you I'd really consider going somewhere else to eat if you like good food
Sylvia's is actually one of those places that you should check out when you are in New York City
Though most tourists do not appreciate Harlem for what it is; I always take first time visitors down 125th St
and straight to Sylvia's
Clearly, this is not the best eating in the city, but it is the best in Harlem without a doubt
Further, if you pay attention to the pictures and articles on the walls you will soon notice that you are dining in a uber cool spot
The food is good and no, they do not add the tip
I go there fairly often and for 11
95, I get really full
I tried Amy Ruths and they have nothing on Sylvia's
I was disappointed with Amy Ruth's and that place is way more expensive than Syvlia's
The mac and cheese and greens are delicious
There's jazz music on Saturday afternoons
sylvias isoverrated since letting her children run the resturant food quality has gone done she went commercial and the canned food is a digrace to my memories i was happy all the times when my parents brought me from college all i wanted was sylvias collard greens a few years later i went back and was upset with the quality
people who never ate sould food thought it was the best my roommate had nerve to bring some of her canned product and asked me to hook it up?  i never went back i would one day give it a try just to recapture memories again i would love to tell her how i feel i am not the only one who feels like this
if this message could reach her tell her to kick everyone out of her kitchen and do it like i know she can
March 17, 2003  Sylvia's should be boycotted for perpetuating the worst in soul food
The atmosphere is touristy; the food is tasteless, heavy, and rarely made from fresh, natural ingredients; the wait staff is hurried; and the bill of fare comes with the tip already included - even for parties of two
One of the measures of any soul food restaurant is its cornbread
Sylvia's is dry, crumbly, overly sweet, bitter, and tasteless
Moreover, it was impossible to get butter to go with the cornbread
It came with two offensive packets of margarine
Imagine a restaurant that is too cheap to provide butter!   Sylvia's is for tourist and others who are easily misled about what quality, Black southern cuisine is
And it is outrageously over-priced for the quality and atmosphere one gets
Our main courses were inedible
Stay away!!!!
I had heard that Sylvia's was over rated but I wanted to give this place the benefit of a doubt
I went for breakfast this past summer
The service was good but for such a famous restaurant and the prices charged, I thought the ambiance would be better
I was also praying for a spectacular breakfast(which didn't materialize) The meal was just average(I can do just as good for cheaper)
I'm going back to NYC this month but not to Sylvia's
P
S breakfast cost $40 for a party of 3 (we only order eggs, grits sausage, toast and a cup of coffee) Rule of thumb
DON'T BELIVE THE HYPE!
I heard so much about Sylvia's and wanted to go and when I did, I wish I hadn't! What you hear is not only overated, but a bunch of LIES! The food was the worst, like an earlier reviewer said, it taste like food just came out of the can and then it wasn't even hot
The prices are just too damn ridiculous! What we had, they need to give it away to the dogs out in the streets! We had to send our food back twice and they still didn't get it right
Ever heard of an invention called the MICROWAVE!!! And this is supposed to be a Soul Food place!!! If that's the case I need to open me one up! I'll never, ever, ever, ever go back!!!!
This restaurant was excellent about 5 years ago
Now the food is just decent
There are many other places in Harlem (less well known) where you can get better food for less money
It doesn't make any sense to go here when places like Copeland's and Spoonbread are not far away
My aunts took me here and the food was good

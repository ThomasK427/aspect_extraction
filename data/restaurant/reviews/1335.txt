Ribot was the only winner
My criteria were excellent food, trendy settings, great service and value for my money
I must say, Ribot delivered on each of my critical points
The food was succulent, the waiters were very attentive, and my green apple Martini was amazing
My only disappointment was that I could not benefit from people watching
Although the terrace area was full, only 2 or 3 tables were reserved inside
I guess most New Yorkers leave NY for Easter - have to make room for all of the visiting Montrealers
LOL
I found this restaurant on Citysearch, have passed the restaurant many times and since there were free martinis for the Ladies Wednesday night, my husband and I decided to try it
The space is remarkable and the food and service were outstanding
However, our one and only complaint was when I received my drink I gave my coupon to our waiter, he returned minutes later to tell me that it could not be used in the dining room, only at the lounge or at the bar
Since the coupon does not state the distinction, it was not a really great way to start off the meal
However, all else was really great and we do look forward to dining there again, just don't expect that the promotions will be honored
Hidden at the corner of 48th and 3rd, one will easily miss this gem
Ribot is a hidden find in this city of food
Ribot serves classic italian dishes, noteably its mussel soup, tuna tartar and roasted porchetta
The elegant dinning room exhibits a flare for a fine date and some fun
The service is four stars - attentive, knowledgeable and friendly
Ribot also serves an impressive wine selection
Don't walk pass this restaurant for you are missing out one of the city's Gem!
it was my birthday saturday night and as a party of 18, we were treated extremely well from start to finish
we were seated at two separate tables adjacent to each other, and they came to check on us several times, offering another drink as soon as one was almost empty
elegant decor, got busy around 730pm, but since our reservations were at 630, the restaurant was practically vacant at first
others found parking right across the street, so it was a perfect location
What a wonderful way to kick in the new year! Instead of going to a over-crowded lounge, having dinner with some close friends was a great way to start 2006
It was very festive with hats, noise-makers, and confetti
At midnight, there was a balloon drop, and champagne
The six-course prix-fixe dinner that absolutely amazing
The oysters with creme fraiche and caviar (delicious), rack of lamb and filet mignon were so tender, and the dessert, the freshest berries with anise
They tasted like they were picked in the middle of summer! The staff was very attentive and nice
Plus, a very handsome, whom I presume was the owner, and overall staff
You could easily miss this restaurant just walking by
Summer time they have a large outdoor seating but in the winter months you really need to look for it
Ask for a table by the little alcove or a table by the window for a romantic evening
Innovative Chef Jeremy Griffiths has a great talent for creating Italian dishes with a Mediterranean flair
Each dish is nicely balanced for your senses using fresh and organic ingredients
You have to try the Roasted Berkshire Porchetta, Grilled Calamari with Prawns also the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartar and Aged Prosciutto with Mozzarella di Bufala for starters
Certainly save room for the dessert, Chocolate Fondant or the Apple Tart Tatin or a Cheese Platter would be a nice way to finish of an evening with culinary delights
Your choices will be complemented by a nice selection of gently priced wine collection
just a perfect place to have a business lunch
Their $25 prix fix is always changing
The homemade pastas are to die for
If you have not tried this place, you are really missing out
You be the judge
Had lunch at Ribot last week(11/18/05) was fantastic, checked out their Thanksgiving menu, sounds mouthwatering
and they actually have availability
check it out
We live across the street from Ribot and only finally made it there for dinner tonight
I am not sure why we waited so long as the food, ambience and service were wonderful
We would recommend a meal at Ribot to friends and family and plan to go back soon!
I was in Ribot for dinner soon after they opened and had an ok time
The food was not quite there although the service and decor compensated well
I live and work in the area so I went back last week with a collegue
I must say that I was really impressed with the change
Our server explained that the chef had changed and the menu was more focused on traditional home style dishes
I had the home made fettucine and it was excellent
Most items on the new menu seemed moderately priced and my tab was less than expected
I will certainly be back and already suggested this restaurant to several people
there were only 2 other couples in the entire place when we arrived although it filled up nicely - place is so clean and brand new , the glasses sparkle
from the hostess to the wait staff everyone was extremely professional and well trained
there were no rude intrusions and disruptions to our conversation or our space -- didn't realize it until we left, how nice
the menu is interesting and has some regular choices for the less adventurous
my meal was delicious and very nicely presented, so were my friend's choices
i recommend Ribot and wish them success and a good run
From the prompt service to the wonderful ambience to the great food, this place had it all
On top of that, the portions were hearty enough that we barely had any appetite left for dessert
I wouldn't recommend the restaurant for large groups, however, it's perfect for a date or small groups
This place is definately on my go back to again list
A few of my girlfriends and I were walking by Ribot and had to check it out
The terrace is stunning as welll as the ambience
I had the beef carpaccio and pasta
Ribot also has a menu prix fixe for luch for $25 and dinner (4 courses!) for $35
Hey you can't beat that
Check it out
I was at Ribot last week and was very taken by the great atmosphere it exsudes! My guest and I felt very comfortable and at ease
One would think of it as a fancy, stuffy place at first glance, but it is quite the contrary! Elegant yet relaxed was my impression of Ribot
The food speaks for itself-delicious! Ribot is a unique find and great addition to Midtown East!!
I went to Ribot with my girlfriend and had a womderful time!! The food-apparently, they had started a new menu that evening, was impeccable!! I had the pork loin, my girl friend had the red mullet
we love it!! CONGRADS to the chef!! We shared a chocolate dessert that was like a molten lava cake and that was equally delicious
I recommend it highly!!!
Great food! My second time there and it has gotten better! Taking into consideration this place is like 3 months old, it has some kinks to work out, but definitely will be a star on the map
great terrace, removed from the street, beautiful decor, i work in midtown so Ribot is appreciated!
I did a team dinner (27 people) here within a week or two of them opening and they did a fabulous job of handling a large group
Unexpected people showed up and they accomodated them with ease
The portions were somewhat small, but were wonderfully prepared and very tasty
There were no hitches and the ambience was elegent and chic but not pretentious
The servers were very efficient and professional
It was a very nice evening
Really good food
We are so happy to have another good restaurant to go to in midtown
The server told us that the chef is from Il Buco downtown
Welcome to the neighborhood!! we'll see you soon
My girlfriends and I enjoted our night at Ribot the other day
We expeted to have drinks, since it was sucha beautiful day
The terrace is very nice, we ended up having a main course, and it was worth it! I enjoyed every bit of our evening at Ribot
The waiter we had was also very friendly and attentive
I would definately go back!
So my boyfriend and i decided to come into the city for one of our romantic evenings
and it was all worth it!! We heard about this place from a friend who lives in the neighborhood
We found the servicce to be extremly friendly and personable

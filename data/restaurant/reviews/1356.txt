I was totally surprised upon visiting this new place
The decor is super cute and comfortable
The drinks I had were fantastic
I highly recommend the chili con queso and the Rajas con papas tacos
They were also serving Mahi Mahi that night and it was cooked perfectly with a side of cilantro rice
We also had the steak taco, but found the meat to be a little overcooked
All in all, the ambiance was great and we had a nice time
The waitstaff was very in tune to our needs
If you want a chill night with some food and good drinks, I would recommend this place
I was really excited to see a taco stand move into the neighborhood, but after 3 visits, I feel strongly that this restaurant really misses the point of making tacos
A taco should be inexpensive street food
Taco Chula's tacos are expensive and not special enough to compensate for the additional cost
They should probably graduate the cost of different tacos (vegetarian, beef, and fish tacos are all the same price), as some clearly have more expensive ingredients than another
Finally, the service is slow, as is the kitchen, and drinks are mediocre
Walked into this place on Grand St
last Sunday and had a SUPER Mex-style brunch
I've been looking for great breakfast tacos, and these were the real deal--flavorful, savory, and not at all greasy
Their sweet corn pancakes were also delicious (I wanted to lick the syrup off the plate!)
Really fun and a good find
Cheap, too
Tried this new taqueria last night and was impressed with the homemade tortillas
The Key Lime pie was killer too
Groovy curve-shaped red wall is a cool decorative touch
You'll do better picking up a burrito from a place with slightly less ambience
Prices are high here for food that is basic at best
small tacos with rather boring fillings are served in plastic baskets without rice, beans or other garnish
Very hard to get full for less that 12 bucks
Drinks are expensive too, and portions of all dishes are very small
Very pretentious and overpriced
The food is good, but why pay nearly four dollars for a taco when Williamsburg is home to numerous authentic, Mexican-owned and operated taquerias where you can get equal if not better quality food for less than half the price
If you do decide to go definitely don't order the chile con queso-eight dollars for velveeta cheese and chips?! You're paying for the chic bar and decor, but it's equivalent to paying 8 dollars for a hot dog just because the place serves Martinis too
this is the best new restaurant ever! the food is better than excellent and the service is wonderful
we had lots of drinks, queso, tacos, quesadillas, frijoles, guacamole, 1 of every dessert and our party of 5 left too full but very happy
we'll be back there a lot!
Having eaten at Raices once before, my fiancee and I decided to take a group of friends there for dinner on a Saturday night
There was only one other party there when we arrived, and we were seated immediately, but after that, we were pretty much ignored for the rest of the night
I had to physically get out of my seat and find the waitress twice just to ask for more water
When we finally got to order, we were told the bartender wasn't there, so we couldn't order any drinks
We ordered one appetizer for the table, which didn't arrive until two other parties had been seated and served
Then, 3 of our 7 entrees arrived, and we waited for the rest
When the fourth entree arrived, I asked when the other 3 would be out and was told 3-4 minutes
It ended up taking another 10-15 minutes to get the other 3, at which point the first 4 were cold
The seafood paella was extremely fishy and almost inedible
At the end of our meal, I approached the waitress and asked that they not charge us for the $25 appetizer
She explained that the chef's assistant had not shown up for work, and that was why everything was so slow, but she said she would see what she could do
However, after speaking with the manager on the phone for about 15 minutes, the waitress said they couldn't give us any discount but would gladly give us a free pitcher of sangria
I nicely told her we weren't interested in the sangria and that I felt they should give us some sort of discount
The waitress finally agreed to take one entree (the cheapest one which was less than half the cost of the appetizer) off the bill
Overall, the experience was extremely disappointing given the fairly pleasant time my fiancee and I had our first time there
We had diner there last week
The chicken was seasoned to perfection and the rice was delicious
The inside is very clean and comfy
We'll be back for sure
The best new restaurant this city has seen in years
Night and day beautifully blends the sensibilities of the Cornelia Street Cafe and the White Horse Tavern, former roosts of its owners
It is New York's culinary salon
The food is unerring, the portions are bountiful, the service is gracious, and the wine list is full of delightful, well-priced surprises
After dinner, stop downstairs and listen to the music of tomorrow's jazz stars
I really don't get why some restaurants on 5th Ave think they can charge around or over $20 for an entree simply because Al Di La or Tempo does
HELLO people, get a clue
The food has to actually be good! Night and Day is mediocre all around, so they don't even come close
Dinner entrees are tiny portions, bland, blah, not special
The staff are really young
Some do try hard, some don't, but all are very inexperienced and it shows
We were seated next to the big sliding doors on a cold evening, and the draft froze the whole half of my body next to the windows
And when I said something about it they just shrugged saying yeah it gets like really cold there and it didn't occur to them to close the velvet curtain that was hanging right there
The food is just great! They have an excellent selection of wines and yummy desserts
And since they started having live jazz at night, its become my new favorite spot
The service is great, the servers are really friendly/great attitudes! Go at night
its more romantic!
I have eaten there with my wife a few times
The food is tasty but it would make an anorexic say Hey, where's the food? She had the Salmon and asked for a side of mashed potatos and only got 2 spoonfuls
give me a break! If I want overpriced little bits of nothing I'll go to Manhattan
The only exception to this rule are the specials
The times I went they were excellent and there was enough to make it worth the money
I highly recommend the duck and the short ribs specials if they have them
I absolutely love this place and would recommend it to any and all
We went for dinner on a cool Saturday evening
We had the poached pear salad, corn chowder and vegetable napoleon to start
All were superb
The entrees; trout, hanger steak and salmon, were equally delicious
The atmosphere of this place is warm, welcoming and extremely friendly
The service was impeccable
The owner graciously came to our table, offered us some wine to taste and gave us a tour of the newly-built skylit dining room in the rear of the restaurant
A baby-grand piano is on the way and Park Slope will finally gain live jazz shows
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!! Thank you for joining Park Slope, Night Day! As for the bad reviews
give 'em a break
they're brand new!! All new ventures have wrinkles that need to be ironed out
I always have a (Delicious!) soya or skim cappuccino and a pain au chocolat to go every morning @ this restaurant, then I tried it for lunch
I loved it
The waitress encouraged to come for dinner and brunch, and I followed her recommandation
My family and friend happened to spend a great time there
Food, service
We really enjoyed the experience, and since we brought more people there! You don't have many places in Brooklyn that serve great food until 1/2 am!
Dinner was greater than my expectations
It was terrific
The 'paella', not a true paella, but great flavor and lots of mussels, clams, chicken, hot sausage; delicious saffron rice
Special spinach salad with crisp bacon-like ham pieces and crumbled blue cheese was perfect
The nicest and smartest wait staff I've dealt with so far in Park Slope
No attitude, just warmth and efficiency

Though the food isn't five star, it's very good and not even the hip meatpacking district can offer a sunset marina view like this!
I was roaming around the neighborhood with my friends, and we came across this restaurant
We ate here for brunch, and it was great!! The atmosphere and drinks were wonderful and there was a beautiful view! The servers were courteous and very attentive
Their Lobster Club and 10 oz
Steak Burger were excellent! This place may be pricey, but I think it's worth checking out
Working in the area, I know Southwest to be the best drink and/or food spot out there
Of course, both are generally comped through work, but on the rare occasion I do splurge, the drinks are worth it as is the atmosphere
Try the Hoisin chicken Salad or the Skirt steak which is served in man-sized portions
Its also a great happy hour and luch spot, having outdoor seating overlooking south cove marina
I will say that we requested a table for two during a moderately busy recent lunchtime outing, but were denied by the less than inquisitive gate girl
There were several larger tables available and the reticence to seat two at a four person table makes me quite angry
However, as far as food, its near the top of what you can get down in these parts, which ain't much
Great after work and outdoor spot
The huge outdoor cafe makes it easy to always get a table
This place reminds me of a trendy outback, except the service was much better, and there was more variety in the theme-based food
It was a good time, the service continually came by to ask us how we were doing and the food was marvelous
The restaurant is quite trendy, as its located in the Battery Park area, and the prices were comparable to a lot of national chains ($8
95 for nachos for example, $11-16 per entree)
I came here with a big group and the combination of the service plus good food made the experience worth savoring
I will be back again soon
I work in the Financial District and visit SouthWest at least once a week and I have never been dissapointed
My colleagues and I have ordered from the delivery service as well
The food came neatly packed, was hot, and I love th ebags provided, inlike the cheap ones one gets in some other restaurants
Hands down the best resaurant in and around the Winter Garden
This restaurant has some of the best undiscovered food in NYC
don't jet get a burger (they are good) but try one of the entrees
This chef knows what he's doing
The service is terrific and the outdoor seat is great!!
As I enjoyed the pile of seasoned fries that came with my crunchy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside Cuban sandwhich, I noticed how much more beautiful the cruiseships probably were at night than during the day
So with a desire to know for sure, I made plans to come back for brunch
After indulging in a comfortable stack of dark rum syrup soaked buttermilk pancakes, I decided that the breeze made the difference
I loved it and will come back soon
I have found margarataville and it is at SouthWest NY Restaurant
They have the best fresh fruit flavors for their huge frozen refreshing margaritas
I like gauva and peach combined
And the food is exceptional!!! Everything rocks! I'm telling you you have to try the lobster club, big chunks of fresh lobster! And the view, it's like your own vacation right in the city -- on the North Cove Marina, with sail boats and the Hudson River
So relaxing
Everyone should try it while summer is still here
For one of the best views on the Hudson River, try dining at Southwest NY
The setting and ambience are beautiful
On top of that, the food is quite good as well
They offer simple items such as a burger, but you can also find a delicious top rate filet mignon on the menu as well
The cocktails are excellent too
They have some of the best frozen margaritas in the city hands down
Definitely a good choice for downtown dining
I have been in a lot of resaurants, but what I really like about this one is the friendly atmosphere it provides
It is a place where you can relax just chilling out in the lounge, or having delicious dinner while enjoying one of the best views in New York City! Here I have had the best calamari and beef steak, not to mention the cocktails! This is my place!
Had dinner and drinks here and was not impressed at all
The food was not even mediocre at best
If you want delicious food, this is not the place
I would not recommend glasses of wine, just go for the bottle
Or maybe the cocktails would be a better choice
The service was fast and attentive
Friendly staff
The view is amazing and the place is buzzing with people, but ultimately, you go to a restaurant to eat
I won't be eating here again, but i'll probably have drinks or something outdoors during dusk
Drinks were great, mussel appetizer was good, entrees were very average
My fish was so watery it had very little taste
However, the service was very good, the selection of drinks was extensive and the size very generous
Nice place to watch the sun go down on the Hudson
I wouldn't necessarily go there for the food
Great environment - over priced for quality of food and service
This restaurant is fantastic; their food is very tasty and the different choices that their menu offers will make everyone happy
Also the best margaritas in town are here at SWNY; so the perfect dinning experience will be an outside table to enjoy the view and a frozen margarita!!!!
This place is great! I've been here a few times and always had prompt, cheerful service and good food
The appetizers are particularly good: I recommend the mussels with white wine broth and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce
The view is incredible: right next to the yacht marina; you feel like you're in Miami or anywhere is but New York
Also a nice place to unwind for a drink after a long day of work
Very crowded outside but there's usually room at the bar
Highly recommend!
The best part about Southwest NY is the appetizers
The entrees are decent, but not extradordinary
The menu and website are great advertisements for the entrees which unfotunately don't live up to their pictures
My boyfriend and I have visited this place quite a few times in the past 2 months and we are greeted and treated with impeccable service each time
This is one of the few places where you can have your choice of entree, your way
They have yet to diappoint me with the crispy fries and oysters that I always request
Their coctails and frozen margaritas are out of control and plentiful in quantity
The staff is attentive and articulate
I amdefinitely be a regular
go Southwest NY
There's much better chinese food out there
I had great initial impressions due to the quick delivery and the staff following my directions on my special order
If your company isn't paying for it, search out one of the other chinese food places
Chef Hong's is Chinese food the way it used to be with egg in the fried rice, chicken wings with the best savory batter that you have ever tasted and a menu with delights that transport you to Asia
Now do not misunderstand this is not a resturant with ambiance however if you are looking for great take out in the St
George Area of Staten Island make Chef Hong's your choice
The Iguana's cuisine is a fusion of Italian with a southwestern touch
There are dishes here to please every palate
A true NY bargain only steps from the Staten Island Ferry
You always feel welcomed by the employees and the locals that frequent this charming bar/restaurant
Their food portions are large and always delicous and at bargain prices
They always have a lot of activities going on, ie: Mama Mia Monday (A 2 for the price of 1 pasta night), Wednesday - Sorority Night, Friday - Karaoke, Saturday - Lounge with D
J
and Sunday - Brunch with unlimited drinks
Always a great place to be
My boyfriend took my to Adobe Blues for the first time about 4 years ago
The place is amazing
Every time I go there, I try and try something different
and every time it is amazing
The waitresses/waiters are always great and cater to your every need

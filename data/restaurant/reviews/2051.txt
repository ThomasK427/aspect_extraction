The food and service was excellent
The prices are very reasonable
The portions are not huge but filling, and leave enough room for desert
The food was excellent!
i took my boyfriend their for his 24th birthday and we had the greatest night! It was very romantic and beautiful
The service and food was INCREDIBLE and the wine was amazing also! I can't wait to go back!
My b/f took me here last night for my birthday
We had a table in the corner w/candle light
Our waiter was great in suggesting what specials we should have
They also have a nice selection of wines
Dessert (my favorte part) was AMAZING
Thanks honey the night was memorable
I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend, and we are pretty tough critics
I love good food and so does he and none of us mind paying for it as long as it is worth it
In this place it was all worth it
It was amazing decor and service
The food one of the best dishes I have had in NYC
I would suggest this restaurant for anyone that can make it
Great spot for special occasions
A classic Village restaurant (one of the oldest in the city
the building has been their FOREVER)
great for a romantic dinner for two
Excellent service and ambiance
Being a newyorker, I've been hearing about this hyper-romantic institution since forever
I'll bet this place was something in it's hey day, and it's still a nice place, with rich wood carpeted ambiance
Charmingly good, but un-inspired dishes combined w/good service and luxuriously decorated albeit aging infrastructure places it about a notch lower than the $$$$ it charges
This would be a top-notch experience anywhere else but NYC
I took my fiancee to celebrate our one year anniversary last Saturday
It's started badly with the bar running out of martini glasses - $15 for a cocktail and they served a martini in a white wine glass
Then we were seated in a dark corner upstairs and it took 15 minutes for us to get the waiter's attention
Neither of us liked the starter, although the main course was good
I ordered the soufle for dessert and thought it tasted too eggy (compared with a incredible souffle I had at March)
Total check: $313 including tip - for this amount of money, I thought the overall experience was extremely disappointing
Try Danube or March instead for romantic occasions
GF and I went (non-occasion) after hearing good reviews, but had to wait 30 minutes past reservation with not even an apology
Decor is rather gothic, granniesque
Ordered tasting menu with wine pairing, for which the waiter/somelier paired the wrong first wine
For the entree pairing, there's an optional upgrade wine for $40 extra, which we declined
The dishes themselves were nothing spectacular (Aquavit, Bayards, Grammercy are much better)
I asked the waiter why we were CHARGED EXTRA for the declined upgrade on the bill, he adamantly claimed that he had specifically asked me and I had accepted! When I demanded to talk to the manager, he returns without the manager, saying, We'll do you a favor and charge you only half price for the wine upgrade
I was so pissed that I just payed the whole price and walked out
$26 bar + $286 mediocre meal for horrid service
Outstanding food,wine and ambience
Service was excellent,(our waiter sat us next to the ornate fireplace
) This was a romantic experience which made our vacation
I have no idea where the people complaining about the waitstaff were eating, but it couldn't have been the same restaurant I ate at last night
Everything was absolutely perfect
Even after we ordered off the restaurant week menu, the staff treated us with kindness, let us eat leisurely well past closing time, and even made suggestions as to what drinks would best complement our desserts
I love One if by Land and will be going there again!
This is a nice romantic restaurant
I know what other revier means when she says its not really for young lovers because its not a trendy scene
Its more of a traditional romance type place
The food is good--especially the pork chops (I should have ordered that!)
The service is pleasent, but they did forget to bring my mother in law's appetizer
The price is great
You just can't beat the pre fixe price for a meal like that in such a nice place, but it would have been nice if they didn't forget one of our appetizers
I went here to celebrate an anniversary
While the food was good enough (if old-fashioned - my meal tasted like it was out of a fancy 1950s cookbook, all creamy and rich) the environment was sort of bizarre - rich tapestries, yucky corner-grocer roses on the tables, and a strange '80s mirrored wall, which we sat against at the back of the restaurant
The waiter was nice enough but seemed sort of bored and insincere
This would all be bearable if the meal didn't cost $250
A lot of older people there seemed to be in the zone, enjoying their pork chops
Maybe this is not quite the place for young lovers
With all the hype and recognition this place has received, I was bit intimidated at first
That quickly changed as soon as we entered into this historic old restaurant
From the ambiance to the service to the cuisine, it lived up to all of its expectations
Highly recommended
Had great expectations and we were both very disappointed
Classic decent restaurant but not on Saturdays syndrome perhaps
The decor is nice enough and the atmosphere is old-school romantic but all a but tatty
We were sat upstairs up with all the other special occassion diners
The service was slow to respond, patronizing - a $90 prix fixe menu and we were offered a mushroom tart as a substitute to a meat course??  It was fine but for $130 pp+ it should have been great
We left feeling distinctly untouched and unispired
It lacked that special something and instead left us feeling like one of the hundreds of other couples celebrating an anniversary that night
Never again
This restaurant is romantic as described, but it is a little too dark and too crowded
We were practically shoulder to shoulder with the couple next to us
We were seated upstairs, would recomend being seated in the main dining room
We went there for our 5th anniversary trip to NYC from CA
The service is impeccable, and they did provide us with plenty of extras, knowing that it was our anniversary
The tasting menu was good, but nothing surprising like Commanders Palace in Las Vegas or New Orleans' tasting menu
Auquavit's food is much better and more surprising and would recomend them over OIBL, TIBS
Dessert was excellent
This place deserves all the praise it get the service is great the ambiance is great the food is great! This menu and wine list have a goods to choose from
And most importantly you get no non-sense service! You'll what you ask for
You won't be told oh we don't have this today after asking the waiter for it
This place is a great hide away while your inside you forget your in New York
I highly recommed this place
This restaurant is supposed to be romantic? The tables were practically on top of one another - I could listen to other peoples' conversations and I'm sure they could hear mine
Not exactly what I'd call intimate
The food was fine, but was a little overpriced for what was served
I'd recommend sticking with a NYC staple and go to Aureole instead
It was my first trip to NYC
My husband and I spent five wonderful days exploring the city and the culminating event was our dinner at One if by Land, Two if by Sea
Our server was John and he was the absolute best, I felt like a princess, roses and wine included
Totally recommend this place!!
My fiance and me were celebrating our anniversary
It was a very special occasion for us, however the evening was almost ruined after we had dinner there
We foolishly believed the descriptions and ratings that it is one of the most romantic restaurants in NYC
We made reservation 3 days in advance and particularly asked to be seated by a window or a fireplace
However, when we arrived we were seated in the darkest coldest corner upstairs, right next to the kitchen

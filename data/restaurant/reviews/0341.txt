After living so close to the plethora of Ethiopian around Columbia I was in serious withdrawal until Queen of Sheba opened
Much better than Meskerem even though I think they have the same owner
great food, delicious wine, and lovely service
highly recommended - would dine again
Sushi, Szechuan and Cantonese fused into a single friendly whole
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene Friend House offers a refreshingly austere take on the pan-Asian restaurant
The spare, minimalist space could easily be renamed "Concrete House," as walls, floor and ceiling form a single gray continuum of stone, with small green and orange tables neatly arranged throughout
The Food The kitchen's brand of genre blending is more Chinatown than Park Avenue South
Crunchy, soy-drenched shredded jellyfish gets the meal off to a promising start, with Cantonese-style clam and vermicelli and preserved-fish hot pots to follow
There's also a short list of dim sum-style buns and dumplings, as well as a sushi bar that offers a familiar assortment of rolls and platters
I just ordered from them this evening and my husband found a cigarette butt in his hot and sour soup; ughhh
They chose to remedy the situation by reimbursing us $1
50 cash (the value of the soup), even though we spent over $45
00 for the entire dinner order, which all ended up in our trashcan
Not only do they have a loose grasp of the concept of sanitation, but they also have a lot to learn about customer service
I've probably been to this place at least 20x, and will continue to go b/c the food is great and cheap
But I have to say I have had some strange experiences with the staff there
Just last night I ordered a wonton soup and asked them for some cruncy noodles for it
The waitress told me they didn't have any, when I said I receive them with my delivery orders she said they're just for delivery and REFUSED to give me a bag
I even spoke with the manager and she confirmed they would do not serve them in the resturant b/c they don't look nice
I was quite insistant and she also refused to give me any
If this was the only example I wouldn't bother to write a review, but there's been other times when they refused to give me sliced avocado even though I said I would pay whatever they wanted to charge me, have insisted one of their mixed drinks was what was listed on the menu although it clearly was not (how does something have coke in it when it's clear?), and opened the door to the back area during the winter freezing us out at least 10X after we asked them to please stop and they kept saying OK
I hope management decides to become more reasonable to customer's requests b/c the food really can't be beat

ive been here a couple times and have always been pleased
service is attentive and efficient
the chinese food is solid and portions are large
the friend house chef rolls are a lot of fun as they come with different sauces (like fruity wasabi) and toppings (assortments of raw cooked seafood)
try the friend house special roll or the fantasy roll ($12)
i had the mango beef (tender meat in a slightly spicy mango sauce, $12) the baby cabbage with shitake mushrooms ($10) tonight
both were very satisfying
its a good place to go with groups (they take reservations)
drink menu is extensive and cheap ($6/cocktail)
the lychee sake cocktail was strong but tasty
dessert menu is limited they torch the fried ice cream ($6) in front of you, which is a nice touch
our bill came out to $22pp including alcohol
will definitely come again
I went down there the other day with my friends
We tried friend house roll
It was wonderful, especial the curry sauce
We also tried the twin spicy roll
It was so great if you like spicy
The most special things are their sauce and the combination of fruits in their rolls
The other things I like that are the new sake lounge and out door garden
It is cool
I will recommend
Great lunch specials, and the friendliest customer service
If you do visit, watch out for your fingers when pulling your chair in
the chairs are a precise fit to the tables
On the warmer days, sit in the back garden
And their Grand Marnier Prawns are a luxury!
Friend House has consistently good sushi and appetizers, but the standout is the Friend House Roll
Only once have I gone there and not had it, and I was sorry
Never again! They have a sunset special if you get there before 7:00, which is nice
The service and decor are just fine, nothing out of the ordinary there
my coworker and i always give in to this place for lunch delivery
they have great prompt service and always friendly
the guy that takes our order is so sweet that we almost want to meet him and tell him to his face how great the food is
the chicken skewers are amazing as well as almost all of the lunch specials
and the sushi is fresh and they give you a good bit for delivery
order from here once and you will be hooked
Friend House is just that - a kind of chill place to get good food, with good company in a great environment
Service was friendly and attentive
I have found my new neighborhood spot!
Food was good, service was fast, and prices were reasonable
Unfortunately, I've only done delivery service and have not visited the restaurant
A friend recommended it, so we decided to give it a shot
They delivery up to 30 blocks away, which is amazing
We ordered steamed vegetable dumplings - superb
I've been daydreaming about them all week
The chicken pad thai ($7) was some of the best I've had; not too spicy, just about perfect for me
They were large orders as well, it served as my lunch for the next day
We also ordered moo-shu (spelling?) and pancakes
I've only ordered once, but I'm definitely trying them again
Maybe tonight for dinner
Food was good
Service was good
Very cute first date place
all I can say is the sushi is really fresh, the service is friendly, and the wait is usually short
If you are not afraid of a draft ask to get seated in the back, I like the glass walls and ceiling
My first visit was a private New Year's Eve party last year
The staff was amazing
The food was incredible and the atmosphere topped it off
If you want to experience something a little different, check this place out!
Everything at Friend House was wonderful
Interesting menu, great service, amazing food and service
all for a reasonable price
I would definitely recommend this restaurant
I've been here many times and have always had great good at affordable prices and the service here is great!!!
Friend House's ambience is very friendly and inviting
The staff are kind and polite
The atmosphere is very laidback
The sushi rolls are excelllent especially the speciality rolls like the sakura

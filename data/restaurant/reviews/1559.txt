The oyster appetizer was also way to small to taste
Just OK
There are much better on the island
The best blackened ribeye for the money
good wine list, to boot
Good place for steaks
If you're a meat eater you will like it here
Seriuosly, the food was incredible! The porterhouse was amazing! The service was flawless! My Guinness was never empty and the steak was perfect
cooked to order and not soaking in a nasty butter puddle like every other steakhouse in the city
You don't go, it is your loss!
If you are looking for a romantic candlelit dinner for two you are at the wrong eatery
If you are looking for some great service, great steaks, and classic desserts than this is the spot
It is a rather noisy atmosphere however, where else can you enjoy a great dinner, listen to some hip tunes and watch the yankee game? The service was fantastic and all the food was cooked to perfection
This is definatley one of the best steakhouses in the city and I've been to them all
When you can't hear the person across the table then you know a restaurant is too noisy
The decibel level was excruciating and the food was mediocre
Thought I was at the Cheesecake Factory when they gave us a buzzer upon reservation check in
About a half hour wait with reservations
Unless you are a group of at least 10 boisterous men who are indifferent to food, don't go
This is one fun, classic steakhouse
Great bar scene and very professional bartenders - drinks are made with fresh squeezed juices, which is a big plus
Awesome huge steaks, great side dishes here
The dining room has lots of energy, which emanates from the open kitchen
Sophia, the hostess, does a great job!! She's a great asset
The staff here obviously underestimate New Yorkers or they wouldn't make cunning deception their welcome mat into the restaurant
We were foolish enough to walk in without a reservation on a Saturday night for the sake of a visitor
However, we only waited because we were told that it was only for 20 minutes
20 minutes later, we were told - 30 mins, that became 45 minutes, then, an ADDITIONAL 40 minutes
Given that they managed to string us into already waiting an obscene amount of time, we decided to stick it out till we got a table
At the table, service was efficient and friendly
The portions were enjoyable but massive in true American fashion
However, the fact that the staff were not frank about the wait from the beginning (an hour and a half), we left promising never to return
This is all I needed - one gets overstuffed here
Tenderloin is like buttah, creamed spinach like mom's, garlic mash keeps the vampires away all night! Yes it is crowded, noisey, music not mood setting, tight table seating service could be better
But forgive all this the food is quite fine
SUM IT: Don't go for ambiance service or the music, but tenderloin is excellent, sides are generous
Not cheap though
Try it at least once, either you'll love it or hate it
We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated the bar area was overly crowded
However, the food was great worth the wait for the table
The filet was done perfect the bernaise sauce is excellent
The creamed spinach garlic mashed were great
The music was loud but hip fun
I would definitely eat here again but make sure you have all night
Pros: We were seated promptly, our waiter was nice, and the food was good
Cons: What are they thinking with the music? The playlist totally killed any sort of ambience they were trying for
Really took away from the dining experience and was distracting
Also, 2 out of three of our steaks were cold when they got to the table
They were obviously under the heat lamp while the third cooked
I am still in a RAGE over the poor sevice I received at this resturant
I suppose if we had each ordered an appetizer, a steak, desert and a bottle of Veuve our waiter might have been nicer
But instead he asked us to move it along within an hour of sitting and dropped the check while my dining companion had a full glass of wine in front of her
He told me the managment had told him to get us out of there since there were people waiting and that I didnt have to be such a snob about it
All this and the check was still 120 for 3 people and our whole dining experience was literally an hour
I will NEVER dine at this place again
Too many old school steak houses in this city to settle for this type of corporate debauchery
Popped into the restaurant as a last resort, as other places were full during the Labor Day weekend
Was seated promptly
Service was attentive
Food was okay
My filet mignon was cooked medium at one end, but rare at the other, which in a roundabout way, is medium-rare
Just not how I'm used to
The sides were very good, particularly the garlic mashed potatoes and the hash browns
But what totally stumped me was the ambiance
The interior was okay, in muted browns and warm lighting
But what was with the music? It seemed as if I was in a bar, rather than sitting down to eat dinner
The music choices were perplexing, ranging from Vanessa Carleton to Eminem to Beyonce
It's hard to eat if I'd rather bounce to the music
I know everyone thinks AM is cheesy or whatever but I've been to a decent amount of steakhouses being a redmeat lover and I keep coming back to AM's - Ive never been disappointed
Their calamari comes with an AMAZING dipping sauce and I recommend the filet medium rare with bearnase sauce for an entree with the creamed spinach side - all those are always prepared perfect and I cant get enough! Fun vibe too - loud converstaion over the loud music somehow adds to the ambiance
Always packed so there must be a reason why
I went to A M on a Wed
night, when everyone else had reservations, I didn't, but was seated right away! Great service
The waiter was very attentive
He observed that I pushed my salad dressing to the side and offered me a different variety
The steaks were scrumptious, made to order
Big portions, energetic atmosphere, good value, impressive wines, what more could you ask for in a steakhouse!? Yes, their creamed spinach was to die for
Well well well
Another steakhouse in NYC
I didn't know what to expect based on the mixed reviews I heard about this establishment
But to my surprise, the food was excellent
My steak was age very well, very tender, juicy and a nice portion
The sides were humongous
Very extensive wine list
A bit loud, but once you bite into your steak, every bit of sound will fade
I would definitely recommend
My family was in town so we went to AM by chance
We were 8 people and they had no problem seating us on a busy Thursday night
The food, reasonably priced for a good steak house was excellent and the portions HUGE
The service was incredible although the wait for the food was rather long
I would go back any day and highly recommend this place!!
Ignore any negative reviews on this place
I live around the corner and have eaten there numerous times
Every single time the food is exceptional! Anything you order whether steak or seafood is excellent, especially for the price
This is one of the better priced steakhouses in the city
The portions are also huge
The staff is good but sometimes tries to rush you, but just put them in their place! I highly recommend this place for a group of guys
I've eaten lunch there a couple of times
What a kick if/when they roll back the entire west wall, which is sliding glass, and open up to Park Avenue
Like eating alfresco

Bring your friends, and bring your family
Only draw back usually a wait, no reservations
Al Di La was great
I loved the portabello crab meat appetizer! I like the fact that they have a great assortment on the menu
Very nice atmosphere Average to below average service Below average food for this type of restaurant
The pasta was overcooked, and the sauces were not tasty
Simply bad pasta
The grilled calamari tasted like charcoal
Poor
I wanted authentic Thai food and there was some semblance, but the pad thai was thick the noodles had been cooked to long
The atmosphere was fun and jumpy
The waitstaff were pleasant and helpful
The prices were inexpensive
If you are looking for a quick bite and you are looking for a place to put you in the mood for fun great, but if you are looking for great food, well
I don't know
Although I live in an area where Italian bakerys are every 10-15 blocks
Nicoles is a little out of my way, but for bread it has to be the best
Give it try, it is definitely worth it
I love Nauna's! I've been going there for about five years now and I always get great food and service
The family that runs Nauna's are all very gratious and willing to please
The pizza is very good but I really like the pasta and dinner specials, they are always delicious
From the looks outside you may think it is just a pizzeria, but their dinners are better than anything I've had at Marzulo's or Leone's
Their specials are on par with Giotto's and Fasino's, both highly acclaimed local restaurants
I was looking for a place like this for a while since moving to Montclair
I used to go to Leone's on South Park Street but the service and food was hit or miss
Nauna's is such a great place, the people are so nice, the food is consistantly good and the atmosphere is perfect
I sit in the front room when I'm with the kids, and the back dining room when it's me and my husband on date nights
The specials are as good as any I've had at Palazzo or Giotto (which are both good restaurants) but they are much less expensive at Nauna's
I've been there dozens of times and they never disappoint
Make sure you try the blackboard specials, they are always great
Try the Brocoli Rabe - It is superb! The food is so freshly prepared, and tastes great
Highly would recommend this restaurant to family
No alcohol is served, but you can bring your own wine
The back is for more quieter dining, and the front is for pizza and kids
I have only been there twice, but I am going to go back again
Nauna's is great! lots of pasta choices a very large selection of dinners
Good service and a real family atmosphere make you fell at home there
We go there 2 or 3 times a week
The dining room in the back is much less noisy then the front, ask to be seated there for a quiet night out
Excellent family style Italian restaurant
Casual, yet you can still get a great pasta dish or entree
Prices are remarkably reasonable
It's not the Manor, but for affordable Italian, you can't beat Nauna's
We've been going there for over four years regularly
I took my girlfriend here based on some favorable reviews found on this web site
Our appetizers consisted of the pasta fagioli and new zealand mussels, which were excellent
My girlfiend had the ziti, which was excellent, and I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp, crab, and clams, which wasn't so good -- it was soupy and very overpowering with the fishy smell
After our initial order, the waitress wasn't very attentive (we had to wait 15 minutes at a time to get her attention to refill drinks, order desert, etc)
I would probably have enjoyed a non seafood entree or another special (they had many)
They have a pretty good sized menu, and the prices are really rather good
The front room is indeed family and kid friendly, and they have a pretty good take-out business, from the bustle at the register
The back room looked much quieter
My family and I love Nauna's
We have been going there since we moved to Montclair from NYC in 1998
Montclair has so many restaurants and we try many of them, but we keep going back to Nauna's
The specials are the best around (try the surf turf and the grilled shrimp tower) as well as priced reasonably
Another HUGE plus is they have a parking lot
I think they are the only restaurant in the town that has a parking lot and on a rainy night I don't feel like walking three or more blocks on Bloomfield Ave to get to some place that is higher priced than Nauna's and not even as good
Go there, you'll see!
My Family has been going to Nauna's for over ten years and they have never disapointed
They now have a seperate formal dining room (the Piazza room) in the back that is perfect for a quiet night out
The specials are always great, my favorite is the clams in garlic sauce, but there are always many choices it's hard to choose! Happy dining!
Try the back dining room for a more intimate night out
The specials are the best in the Montclair area
(I had the grilled swordfish and it was the best swordfish I've ever eaten!) I think the front dining room is more suited for pizza and pasta, but the back dining room is definately a serious restaurant - try it, you'll be pleasantly suprised!
If you like innovative sushi this is the place
make sure you check out the Specials board
Do try the Fantastic Roll, it's simply awsome
The staff will chill and serve your sake and if you're lucky Aki (the owner) will stop by to chat
We were looking forward to a meal in Montclair (to where my partner and I recently moved) at an alternative to New York City
My partner had ordered an appetizer that was no longer available; the waitress did not inform us when reviewing the specials
Our meals had been delayed (8:30 reservation, we received entries at 9:55)
They apologized to us but the experience was miserable
Our appetizers were fair (closer to bland)
The filet mignon special was okay (not great) served with string beans and mashed potatoes that were also quite boring
The atmosphere was loud and not very romantic (not the restaurant's fault - we had assumed a more romantic/sophisticated atmosphere)
By dessert time, we decided to skip and pick up ice cream at a nearby parlor
Regarding New York City alternatives, restaurants should realize they have one chance to impress
I wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back
Wonderful food, attentive service, excellent choice of specials and desserts to die for
The quail appetiser was perfect in every way, except that the vinaigrette lacked vinegar
The whole bird was cooked to perfection and has been served with either a blue or Goat's cheese accompaniment
The main courses are generously proportioned, with the breast of duck my personal favourite
The setting is minimalist and the high ceiling creates an acoustic, which can be loud at weekends
But who cares since you should only go to Orbis if you want a fun atmosphere balanced by serious food
Now I shall struggle to get a reservation at short notice but it's all in a good cause!
A dark room under the AP
Very average chinese food
Not up to Montclair stanards
Had their so-called famous burger
It was fair
The fries were good
I won't go back
Much better burgers in NYC
Zacks is better burger for less money too
Best pizza you've ever tasted! I personally recommend their white pizza their plain pies
No need to EVER order extra cheese, they really pile it on every pie they make
Great crust + great sauce + great cheese = great pizza!  I haven't tried their entrees, but if they're anything like their pizza, you can't go wrong
They only accept cash, but who cares -- well worth it! Not much room to sit down, but I take my pizza to the car or take it home with me
Ray's pizza is better than sex!

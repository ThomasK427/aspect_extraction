Owners Marco and Joann have pulled off a great move to this new location
Upon entering a feeling of interest is perceived by the maitre'd
After winding through the small hallway it opens to an opulent bar of white onyx, gorgeous, then to the main dining room with its very tall ceiling
We ate in the bar area which is elegant, but not pretentious
We nibbled on their small appetizers of beet cannellioni filled with goat cheese and the celery root croquettes with its black truffle mayonnaise, astounding!! Then for our first course was an appetizer of green and white asparagus salad tossed with a truffle vinaigrette, and the terrine of foie gras with the sweet sherry caviar, both lovely and well thought out dishes
Entrees of the dry aged sirloin seared only sixty seconds on one side, WOW, I have never had a steak that good
Then the rib roast braised for 24 hours just as good
The side of smoked whipped potatoes had outdone itself
We shared our other entree of the diver sea scallops and lobe of foie gras
Again, very delectable and bursting with flavor
Desserts didn't disappoint with the Valrohona chocolate souffle and the roasted polenta cake
What a way to finish off a meal
Along with dinner we enjoyed two great house cocktails and a wonderful bottle of Burgundy
Looking for a place with outstanding service and atmosphere, then Tocqueville is the place to be!!
Been going to Tocqueville for years, so I was happy to see that they've kept many of my favorite items (like the sea urchin carbonara and 60 sec seared sirloin) in the move, but what I was most impressed by is the new fantastic bar! Slightly less formal than the actual dining room, you can still enjoy a full meal there without the hassle of reservations, or just have a glass of wine or cocktail before continuing your night
And its still the same great Tocqeville service in a surprisingly beautiful space
Didn't think it could get much better
but it did!
This terrific restaurant has been a favorite of mine for years
I'm excited that they have made a smooth transition to the new location
The menu is almost all new but the great Sea Urchin carbonara happily remains
The salmon dish is simple but excellent, and I love the lamb, suckling pig, and escargot appetizer
Plus there's a real bar so you can have a drink in style - great cocktails too
You won't miss the old restaurant as this one has high ceilings and lots of room
Tried out Destino the other night with 2 other couples, it was surprisingly good
Clientle is not so with the times , seemed like a lot of neighboorhood people, but the food was amazing! We all loved it
The service was lacking a bit, we waited about 20 mins for a waiter and water to come to us once we were sat and we had to ask for everything twice, even drink orders - I think maybe we just got stuck with a bad waiter though
Went here the other night with a few friends, we only waited about 10 minutes for a table, and the wait was well worth it!! The food was unbelievable along with the service
One of the best meals I've had in a while! Can't wait to go back!!!
Myself and 8 girlfriends went to Destino last night and had a wonderful time
The meatball appetizer was delicious as well as the calamari, eggplant rollatini and fried mozzarella
Everyone loved their main course as well
The chicken parm is pounded real flat (which led me to believe it was veal)
Besides the confusion - it was great
We went into the kitchen to praise the chef (Mario Curko) and he couldnt be more sweet
Overall a great experience
This is a loud restaraunt though so if you are looking for something more quiet and romantic this is not your place
Also, definitely make a reservation - every single table was filled
Had lunch here recently and the food (get the meatballs no matter what!!!) was amazing and fresh, and the waitstaff was attentive
Could not have had a better experience
SHOWED UP WITHOUT RESERVATION WAS SEATED RIGHT AWAY
LOUD BUT GREAT ATMOSPHERE EVERYONE HAVING A GREAT TIME
FOOD WAS GREAT AND SERVED  PROMPTLY
CANT WAIT TO GO BACK AND EVERYONE I HAVE TOLD ABOUT IT AND HAS GONE HAS SAID THE SAME THING
luckily i get to go to Rao's a couple times a year so i was anxious to try Destino
Mario the chef/owner was head chef at Rao's for many years
his son Anthony worked at Rao's as well and he gave us a nice table
the Southern Italian food was exceptional and the meat balls were just as good as Rao's
please don't go here expecting a Rao's experience because it's totally different!
We just went to this restuarant on Friday
We have been waiting for this restaurant to open for a few months to be greeted by a very unhelpful staff
We were snubbed and then told to go to the lounge with out any follow up on timing of when we would be seated
We spent at least 30 minutes given no options for a table and then left without an update or attendance
We had to leave the restaurant without dining
I was left with a horrible taste in my mouth about the whole experience
Yeah, you can great free booze-sake or white wine if you order $15 or more of food
Also, you get an extra bonus with the free alcohol-pretty darn good sushi
Warning though, they might be a little slow with bringing you the booze!
I went to this restaurant not expecting much and was overwhelmed with the size of the course and the free sake
You have to buy dinner (at least 15 dollars worth) to get it, but the teriyaki dishes are excellant and the sushi is very fresh and cut well! I keep getting calls from my friends thanking me for finding this restaurant
And if you don't like sake, their house white wine is also complimentary, and from what my friends say, it's really good! Go try this place out! Forewarning: Near the end of your dinner the waitress will try to get stingy with the alcohol, but if you're polite about it they'll cave in and get you a refill, try eating slow and getting a good four or five flask/glasses out of the deal
Saw the kind reviews, and the francophile in me was intrigued
Unfortunately, Jack's lacks a cohesive vision of what a 'bistro' is or could be
Uninspired, and sadly - at least for the time being - a missed opportunity
After 40+ years of enjoying eggs, omelets, and the likes, it really boggled the imagination to have a restaurant - on my anniversary no less - to botch a simple brunch the ways these folks did
We were too embarassed to send our entrs back; however, the coffee was so bitter and burnt, we did request fresh cups
Too bad, the waiter only had to be reminded four times
He refused to bring butter for the stale rolls, as well
The folks next to us not only sent their food back, they had to send the wine back as well
I have heard so many horror stories about this establishment, that I now even avoid walking down their side of the street
This is also a good idea if you want to avoid the aggressive young thugs they have dispatched to shove take out menus in the faces of unsuspecting passers by
Ladies and gentlemen, if you really want to make a quick buck - obviously this is your plan - why not try trading pork belly futures? They will be much fresher than your food was
Best thing to happen to University Place in 20 years
Loved the food
Service is attentive and warm
Beautiful, romantic decor
Try the crabcakes, the steak frites, the sinful chocolate fondue, and the amazing selection of wines by the glass
Delicious food at reasonable prices? Warm, yet elegant decor? That's Jack -- a new and most welcome bistro in the Village
I now have had several dinners at Jack, tasting different dishes, and each was outstanding
I highly recommend the hangar steak with frites, the scallop salad and the Cod
The wine list is expansive and well chosen
You would do well to taste for yourself
This recently opened bistro is a great addition to the neighborhood
The top notch food and friendly service makes Jack a wonderful place to take your lunch break or enjoy a relaxing dinner
Fun bar crowd after 8pm and reasonably priced cocktails
Jack is one the way up!
FOR STARTERS, JACKS DECOR IS STRAIGHT OUT OF SOME GENERIC RESTAURANT AT A STRIP MALL
SECOND, THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE
THE WAITRESS GOT OUR ORDER WRONG TWICE AND OFFERED NO APOLOGY AT ALL! MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE! EVERYTHING WAS OVERCOOKED AND FLAVORLESS
THE PORTIONS ARE SMALL
NOT THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO EAT MUCH OF WHAT IS SERVED TO YOU
I really enjoy the brunch at Jack's
It is so causal and especially if you like to eat at the bar
The bartender is friendly and the food is good
Bring your newspaper and enjoy a nice brunch there
University place needed a new bistro like Jack! a cute place with great wine, mussels, and French specialties
I am looking forward to going back for the their special Mussels Night as well as the Wine dinner night
I went here to get brunch with my friend, and was a bit disappointed, despite the cute decor, nice setting, and friendly waitress
First of all the servings are tiny
I never seen such skimpy looking brunch items

On the expensive side though
Jennys was a favorite place of mines, a place where i would take my friends to have a quick bite and a nice bubble tea
But over time the food and the service has gone down in quality
the noodles arent as good, the dumplings are soggy, and the last time i went they were out of my favorite item on the menu =( i also dont think the staff is as polite as they use to be  maybe in time it will go back to being as good as it was, but for now its just average
My three cousins from Germany came to NYC
My family and I came up from NC to join
I had only checked out citisearch for Dim Sum, Indian, Thai, and a few other options and was unprepared for their on the-go-decison for Italian
Without any real guidance, they picked Lunella
Terrible mistake
We arrived on Saturday evening around 6AM and were promptly seated, but from there on things went bad pretty quick
Service was so rude that I got I got agitated and into arguments at the very end (only the second time in the last 25 years)
The food was not much better
Overcooked Pasta, lousy souce, chewy calamary, meats in tortellini were chewy too, chicken breast was try and without flavor
- Espresso was very good
- Overall, very very disappointing experience though
Some of the worst food I had in 20 year of living in the US
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL
WE COULDN'T JUDGE THE RESTAURANT BY THE CROWD BECAUSE THE FOUR THAT WERE ON THE BLOCK WERE ALL EMPTY
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE
THE MEALS WERE REASONABLY PRICED, WAITER ATTENTIVE, AND THE ATMOSPHERE SOPHISTICATED
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE
I found this restaurant over the Internet
They have cool and informative website
Thanks to direction link on the website, it was easy to find it
I had a diner with my boyfriend a few weeks ago
Food was great, our waiter was fantastic
We were sited at the backroom, the atmosphere was cozy and very romantic
There was a skylight and we could see stars
We were very impressed
I highly recommend this restaurant for lovers
We were strolling around Little Italy with some friends from Eng
had the misfortune to stop eat here
The calimari was so bad we sent it back but they wouldn't take it off the bill
The rest of the meal was adequate at best
Our English friends paid the bill were harassed by the surly waiter because the tip was only 10%
If I had been paying there wouldn't have been any tip at all! What an impression of American hospitality
My husband and I stumbled upon this little gem 2 years ago and immediately fell in love with the ambience and the food! We have been back here at least half a dozen times, including Valentine's Day, without a reservation - with NO hassle
The food is superb, especially the penne with blackened tuna- and you can smell the freshness of the mozzarella - and the prices are VERY reasonable which surprised us with food that tasted SO GOOD!But, if you go to Lunellas, you must dine outside - it is the ultimate NY experience to sip wine, while eating delicious Italian cuisine under the stars with your loved one
Lunellas is #1 for us
:-)
Mu husband, another couple and I made the mistake of not having reservations on Valentines Day and, after not finding any seating elsewhere, we stumbled upon Lunella
And what a happy accident it was! We were greeted graciously and seated promptly
Our waiter was courteous and knew the menu well, though he was a little pushy with the bottles of wine
The Seafood Salad anitpasto was fresh and very good
The food came out as we asked it to be: not too fast and not on top of eachother
The host and hostess checked on our table and were very nice
It was a little cramped at our table and our wine bucket kept getting bumped into, but the meal was good and we had a really nice time
In Short Stephen Latargia draws from his background in restaurant management and from his mother's upbringing outside Rome at this unadorned one-room restaurant
The name comes from an Italian word used to encourage friends and family to eat, and the encouragement at Mangiarini comes in the form of minestrone soup, Arborio rice with seafood, baked rigatoni, and ricotta balls stuffed with chocolate
Red shiny tables with candles and white linen napkins put an upscale twist on an unfussy dining experience
Great Gnochi in the most Italian tradition (and at only $13 the dish)  Unpretentious; very attentive service; they will do their best to please you
A don't miss
Any time you want a great meal without spending $100 per person, this is a great place to go
The service is really wonderful - attentive and knowledgeable
We've had great success following their lead for best courses/wine combinations
They'll treat you the same way weather you're splitting a salad and entree or buying 3 bottles of wine
The food is superb - try the lasagna or gnocchi
They're starting to get popular, so reservations on weekends are probably a good idea, or for groups larger than 4
This place is tiny
we walked right past it even though we were looking for it
However, it was worth the visit
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant
The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go
The whole experience was satisfying
A nice find in the neighborhood
The food is ok at this small Italian place but when I say, BAD Service, it's probably the worst I've ever experienced in nyc
Just sloppy, indifferent servers that have no idea what they're doing
They brought the wrong dish and incorrect change
For the 1st time in my life I wrote a complaint letter and guess what? no response
That joint is filled with walking corpses and it bothered me tremendously
My friends and I vowed to never go back
Last night my friends and I had a wonderful dinner at this cozy Upper East Side restaurant
The food was delicious and the service was outstanding! The friendly owner made us feel like guests at his own house
Please don't try to skip desert! I almost made the mistake not to try the orange tiramisu but I'm glad I did since it was fantastic! We had a great time and I'm sure we will be back many more times
I can highly recommend this restaurant
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly
The menu has so many fish items and oysters
We all ordered different entrees so we could share
The fish was really,really fresh
I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly! Service was great; wine was good, only concern would be that there were too few light beers
This place is right on my corner and I will never go back
The service was clutzy the food wasnt good, and it was one of those I'm stuck in the twilight zone services
We went here late on a Sunday night
It was almost 10, and the restaurant we wanted to go to had closed, so we went to Mare because it looked nice
My wife and I shared a mussel appetizer which was tasty enough, though some mussels were small and there was too much grit in them
We each got a sea bass entree, and that was quite delicious
Also, it came with 2 kinds of vegetables (green beans and carrots) as well as potatoes
Good wine by the glass, also
The only thing I found slightly annoying was when the waiter offered us only bottled water
Every New Yorker knows that NYC has the best tap water in America

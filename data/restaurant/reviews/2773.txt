So come on by for the best pizza experience of your life!!!!
This, in my opinion, is one of Brooklyn's best pizza parlors
They offer many varieties of pizza, all very delicious and very fresh
Prices are reasonable, and hot dishes such as heros and pastas are also good
Seating is not plentiful, but turnover is fast so one doesnt usually have to wait long for a seat
Truly a standout pizzeria
I;ve been having their tomato and broccoli slices for years now
Friendly staff and fresh, piping hot, colorful pizza make this place somewhere to come back to time and time again
Their seating area is betetr than most pizza joints and is more itlian than most places too
Just simply great
Trio is one of the best local Brooklyn pizza places
Delicious crust, pies, chicken parm and all the classics done perfectly
Best pizza in the area
This pizzeria has been around for ages, but it used to be better
The regular pizza is not very good anymore, but they have something called a marinara slice (cheeseless square) which is delicious
Hero sandwiches are mediocre, salad and pasta dishes are ok
To their credit, they offer free and relatively fast local delivery
The best Israeli food around
This place is worth the getting to
Order a falafel or shawarma plate and you get as many salads as you want -- and they are YUMMY!!! Everything is super fresh, and Kosher, of course
They bake their pitas on site, so they are warm and thick, just like they make it in Israel
This is the only place in New York that I like the falafel at; I am picky since I am Israeli, and I am used to the best! I really recommend this place, even if you are coming from manhattan, its worth the subway ride
Oh, their fries are amazing -- a total must! Careful when ordering soup, the portion is huge, you need to share, but its worth spending the extra couple bucks on just to taste it -- its all home-made food
YUM YUM!
Was a time that this place was the grande dame of brooklyn diners
now its just one of many
ordinary
ho hum
except for fish
They do know how to cook fish well
Most items are overpriced
I used to be a very big fan of caraville
The food was always very fresh! The waiters were also wonderful
Then, new management took over
They kept the same reliable waiters on, which was a relief, and they kept the menu as it was, but now, things are getting bad
While service is still ok, the food has been not up to par on my last few visits
I recently ordered a lobster dinner to go for someones birthday and the person said it was not edible
When I complained, I was told that it was my mistake for ordering it steamed and that everyone should know that one should only order it broiled
NOT a way to keep a customer, thats for sure! Verdict: Still an ok place for a cup of joe and a piece of cake, but dine elsewhere
Caraville is a great place to eat lunch
It's also a nice place to get a coffee and a snack for a reasonable price and you can sit at the counter and talk with whomever you're with without time constraints
Food is ample, occasionally a bit overpriced on some items, but with other courses it proves to be a great deal
The feisty geriatric crowd proves to be amusing at times
The wait staff gets to know you, and is great to befriend
They're not cheap on bread or water
This Ukrainian/Russian food take-out deli caters outstanding home-made cuisine
We usually purchase something from there on a weekend just for ourselves or order large quantities when we organize parties
The food is enjoyed by everyone, regardless of the nationality or origin
if you want serious italian kosher pizza, you can't beat pizza times squares!!!
The Scene Dominic De Marco's takeout pizza parlor hasn't changed much in four decades
Potted herbs still grow in the sun-bathed windows; the counter conversations are loud and in Italian; and the few wood tables still wobble--though they seat more city folks
While his three children expedite orders, Mr
De Marco cooks in a world of his own, glancing up only at the recognition of regulars' voices
The Food No one does it like this anymore: After stretching homemade dough, Mr
De Marco swirls his sprightly sauce, meticulously hand-grates three kinds of fresh mozzarella and drizzles olive oil over the top
Once in the oven (electric, mind you), he shifts pies every few seconds to attain nicely-charred, chewy crust perfection
Both options--thin, roundish, Neopolitan-style pies with puffed edges, and thicker, cheesier rectangular ones--get a sprinkle of shaved Grana Padano and fresh basil before serving
Even slices are superb: He shaves on the mozzarella before reheating
This place is too far away and the restaurant itself is dirty and decrepit to boot
The owner is a sweet man, but he has no rhyme or reason when it comes to running his business
We were standing in line for over 1
5 hours and he was making pizzas for people who came in after us
Another guy on line who was there before us tried to complain and the owner just shrugged
We just got fed up and ended up leaving
Wake up people! This is NYC, you can practically trip over great pizza don't bother with this place
If you want to wait 1 hour for a fresh slice this is the place for you
(Try to spent minimum 10 minutes on checking out how he (the owner) makes the pizza
Awesome pizza !!!! Not expensive at all
Made fresh - never reheated !!!!!!!
One can debate what is more rewarding: Watching Dominic shaping his pies as if he was Stradivarius making a violin, or actually eating one! Be prepared to wait LONG time (by NY standards) - but it is worth it
The pie is fantastic: all ingredients are fresh, crust is thin and juicy! The biggest problem is finding parking space
The first time my husband and I went here we each ordered two slices
Thank goodness we did because we waited over an hour
I never waited that long for a pie, let alone a couple of slices, but my husband said that it must be worth the wait because some guy just left with six boxes of pies tied up and heading for the subway
Was it worth the wait? ABSOLUTELY!!! The fresh cheese and basil make such a difference
Will I go there again? Of course - but I will CALL in my order ahead of time and pick it up
My friend said that there is no better pizza
The owner is proud of his store, takes great pride in his ingrediants and is beloved by his patrons
The wait is long and the place is dirty but has a certain ambiance anyway
I really wanted to love this pizza
Unfortunately, the pizza was just not that good
oily and burnt, great cheese though
The best tasting pizza by far, a long long wait for service but well worth it
It is best to order a pie with something that no one will typically order
For Example, pizza with garlic(that way you can judge the time that it would take you to recieve your pie)
This pizza is really fantastic! (especially when a person like myself is willing to travel from Baltimore,Md for a pizza pie)
amazing intoxicating well worth the hour plus wait
simply put no matter if you're Bill gates you could not buy better pizza
Dom is an artist there is no other way to put it! The care and love that goes in to his method of madness leaves Robert De Niro in the dust! No where on earth will you get better then this! So the ambiance is non exist'nt so what? You're not going there for the decor you're going there for the best freeking pizza on the face of this earth and I garuntee you Dom delivers big time!
Dominic is a pizza god
There is no pizza like Dom's
I have traveled all over the US and nobody comes close to making a slice like Difara's does
The Sicilians are also out of this world
Dominic is friendly and his children (adult son and daughter) work along side their father in the preservation of one of Brooklyn's best traditions--great pizza
I used to work next door in a bagle store and I would rather pay for the pizza than eat free cold-cuts and deli food
Dom, molto gracie!
Having grown up in the neighborhood , it is isn't surprising that Di Fara's made this list
When I really need good pizza I fly in From Arizona for a few pies, go to friends house , freeze them and fly home
Friends here beg for more
The journey may be long and the wait may be longer, but there is nothing that could keep me from this pizza

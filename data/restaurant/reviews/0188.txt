I was able to walk in Sunday night without reservations
No hipsters or tragic loud players so dining was enjoyable
I called Pipa yesterday afternoon to make reservations for 4 people at 9:00
I was told that only outside seating was available at that time
I said, that would be fine and had the hostess confirm my reservation before hanging up
My friends and I showed up promptly at 9:00 and we were told (by both the hostess and the manager) that our reservation was for 9:30 (not 9:00) and that I misunderstood
Too make a long story short -- we didn't wait until 9:30 to be seated, so I can't comment on the quality of the food
BUT if the quality of their service is any indication, then you do the math
I decided to take 3 friends who don't know each other very well out for a night and picked pipa with some reservation after reading poor reviews
My doubts were cleared immediately, the host was friendly and yes they suggest the pitcher of sangria before you look at the menu but you should take it anyway! The food wasn't great (but I'm admitely not a fan of anything other than bland food- so perhaps that's a good thing!) but the 3 chocolate desert dish was divine
The waitstaff doesn't rush you
The decor would have given us enough to talk about had everyone not gotten along well!
Pipa is one of the best secrets in NYC
I have been there twice and both times were equally wonderful
Food is very unique and use alot of combinations not found in American cusine
I wouldn't have guessed it Spanish when I walked in, but you can see hints in the types of spices and cheeses they use
TRY THE CHEESEPLATE! The cheeses are wonderful, as is the Chicken Rice dish
Sangria is wonderful
but get the hidden smaller version for 15$ less
gets about 5-6 glasses! Little crowded and service could be better, but no complaints from me!!
Walking into Pipa, I was expecting the worst after reading a lot of these reviews
But the food was excellent, the sangria was great, the service was very good and the atmosphere was wonderful! The only semi disappointing aspect was the price, considering how much food you get
But the quality was certainly outstanding! I recommend!
After checking out some bad reviews, I was hesitant about giving my girlfriends reservations to PIPA a try
It turned out great! Service was great, and it was trendy and stylish without being stuck up
We ordered two appitizers, one of which we didn't enjoy much
Our waiter quickly appoligized, removed it from our bill, and gave us free desert! A very nice treat - we plan to go back with a bunch of friends
I've read other peoples' reviews, and I'm disappointed to see the reaction
I've been to Pipa over 10 times in the last 6 months, and every time has been outdone by the last
The food is PHENOMENAL, I've yet to be disappointed
The service is also good; the waiters always try to explain everything as if it were your first time there
Most of the time they ask if you've dined there before, in case you need an explanation on how things work
The sangria (red, i've never tried another) is SPECTACULAR, and quite effective, at that
:o) Try it, enjoy it, and return for more, like I often do
The Scene Glowing orbs and a spicy palette of oranges and reds set the festive mood at this West Village hot spot, where the lounge scene and rooftop DJ help sustain the buzz
An inventive cocktail list--caipirinhas and rum drinks with fresh berries--is just part of what attracts a steady, sleek after-work crowd
The Food The combined cuisine of Japanese sushi and citrus-marinated Latin seviche inspires a successful cross-pollination in many of the kitchen's starters, such as miso soup brightened with cilantro, and vibrant chowder with tender shrimp
Sharing different dishes is a good way to go, though the quartet of the succulent seviche may leave your sushi rolls tasting unexciting by comparison
An Asian pear crisp or chocolate Menta after-dinner drink finishes the meal gracefully
Went here for restaurant week in the summer on a Tuesday Night
After reading other people's bad reviews, I suggest definitely making a reservation and it is NYC and trendy so dress like it! - if those ppl didn't make a reservation and dressed like it was your neighborhood pizza place to stop by, no wonder they didn't get the service (no offense)
Dress code is business casual at the least
Besides, if you have to wait however many minutes, the bar and lounge area (sunken floor banquettes) look fun and the drinks are DELICIOUS!  I was 10 minutes late (thanks MTA) and yet we were seated promptly with my reservation
Also, when I made the reservation I requested to be seated upstairs, and even though there was a private party they managed to save us a table (but we were only 2ppl)
Perhaps they took your reviews because we had a new waiter in training, and he was VERY attentive to us
They didn't rush us out; they kept checking to see if we needed anything even though we signed our bills and we were just sitting there chatting with tap water
Weather was so great to be seated outdoors
Young twenty-somethings, trendy and a seeing area
Sushi was OK, but the crisp short rib was fantastic
Watermelon and crab salad was interesting (never had watermelon with soy sauce) and the banana chocolate cake was great topped with sake sorbet
Their strawberry cocktail is great - easy and I had three
I have to say their sushi combo plate was sort of just OK, but presentation of food is great
Portions look and are small, but for us we were full by dessert (pace yourselves! America is growing obssessed with anything-bigger)
Fun experience
If anything, with regards to the meal - I didn't see any samba (brazilian influence) part
Mostly japanese
Compared to other NYC establishments, SS7 is nothing but a wanna-be trendy spot
Hostess was not professional and extremely unfriendly
She sent us to the bar and told us she'd come and get us in 15 minutes (it was not busy at all and there were plenty of seatings)
40 minutes later, I went to ask her for our seats since she was seating other people
With a straight face, she asked me if we had reservation
Apparently she forgot about us!!! Nice hospitality skill there
Food was average to say the least
And manager did not seem to care when we complained about the hostess
Absolutely horrible
Don't waste your time and money
Go somewhere else
Anywhere but Sushi (no) Samba 7
The only thing that's GREAT here is the Tapas (for 2 or more, $10 / person) as an appetizer
They really are to die for
Oh, and the Calamari
Absolutely spectacular with diced tomatoes and that interesting glaze
When I come into the City this is always the place we go with friends and I've always recommended it until now
Hostesses extremely unfriendly
Took 45 mins after our reservation to get seated
After we were told to wait 3 times they sent us to the bar, then forgot to come get us, then sent to the upstairs bar where we were told to stand on the side so the waitstaff could pass by
on and on and on
Portions seemed to shrink and not as great of quality
In the upper 40's while eating upstairs, but didn't pull down the vinyl on the upstairs for heat
Drinks, scene and upstairs bar are still awesome
I have been to Sushi Samba 7 on several occasions
After my experience last night, however, I will not be returning
It was a nice evening so we decided to dine outside
The atmosphere on the upstairs terrace is very lively
Our waiter ruined the evening
He was THE WORST! We had to ask him for everything
Our appetizers arrived AFTER our meal
When we asked what the problem was, he answered that since he was upstairs, he didn't know what was going on in the kitchen
LAME! He even had the audacity to get an attitude
I realize this is Manhattan, but the meal was overpriced
I'll give credit where credit it due, so I must say the food and drinks were excellent
Still not worth it, especially when the service was sub-par
Don't waste your time and $$$
There are so many other better establishments in NYC
Went to dinner with a group of friends to this place and albeit pricey, it is well worth it
The drinks are really tasty and made with fresh ingredients
The tasting appetizer paltes are full of flavor and my entree, the seafood stew came out in a sizzling iron pot and is really filling
The place is crowded with a young 20-30ish scene and there are quite a lot of beautiful people here
Our waitress Ashley was great!
I've been to Sushi Samba many times

for a regular or a special occasion
Hosted a Bachelor party at the strip house and I cant say enough great things
The food was outstanding as was the advice of our waiter and the wine steward
The prime rib was awesome as was the spinach and the fries
Ambiance was warm and friendly
Even though we werent a huge group the staff was attentive and friendly
If youre looking for a great steak with awesome service in a comfortable atmosphere, this is your place
If you want to be brow beaten by the surly staff at a classic steak joint, youd be happier elsewhere
Id recommend this place for any guys night our or even a fun date
I love this place
The steak is yummy
The bibb salad is delicious
My husband really likes the ceasar
Sides; french fries and creamed spinach-a must
GIGANTIC CHOCOLATE CAKE TOO!!
My boyfriend took me here for a romantic evening
It certainly was
The decor was fabulous, the food was amazing and the music they played set the mood
I recommend the Rib Eye
The cheesecake is so big you will need a shovel but it is well worth it
Enjoy!
Strip House is easily one of the top 3 steakhouses in NYC, it is the perfect place to go to impress a lady on a first date
Steaks were cooked exactly to our order and the side dishes were delicious (black truffles w/ spinach and crisp goose fat potatoes)
Service was great, our waiter (Nigel) couldn't have been better
Finish off your meal with the chocolate cake
One downside was the near 45 minute wait despite reservations
and thats on a wednesday night
Spend your time sitting on one of their couches enjoying a cocktail from the bar
All in all i HIGHLY reccommend Strip House and although a bit pricey it was well worth it
when I have money
I dream about the juicy steaks and especially the creamed spinach, garlic french fries, and stuffed heirloom tomatoes
When I have even more money, I order the lobster! I also like the fact that I have my own table
The one near the restrooms
So what, I like it
The place makes me feel like I've stepped into a private club
Most restaurants ignor single diners, but the waiters at Strip House are so kind and attentive when I dine alone
And I'm not even a blonde with big B----!! This is my absolute favorite steak house
This is not only a place to go for fabulous beef, but it is a fun place
Not romantic, best for a crowd
We had dinner last evening (Sat
night) w/ 3 couples
First we had drinks across the street at the fabulous Gotham Bar Grill (how convenient!) Food at the Strip House was excellent, steak done perfectly
The sides were so yummy
Creamed corn, onion rings, sauteed mushrooms, goose fat potatoes, and my favorite the creamed spinach
Don't bother with an appetizer, not necessary
Worth the $38
price tag for each steak
Fun atmosphere, noisy and happy! Great drinks
Only complaint was that we sat down at 8:30 and didn't get our food until after 10 p
m
, but no one cared because we were having so much fun!
If you are looking for a steak that melts in your mouth
This is the place! The creamed spinach is excellent too
The waiter was very snooty, but that may have been a fluke b/c the hostess was pleasant
If you are willing to pay for a pricey meal this place is your best bet!
from the moment we entered the strip house, we were treated like queens
the maitre d, douglas, was the absolute BEST!!! and our waiter jody was fantastic as well
not to even mention that the filet was to die for
and the sides and salads are amazing too! needless to say, i recommend this restaurant hands down
The rib chop could not have been any better - (the quality of the meat and the flavor), and they were cooked exactly as requested
The creamed spinach fabulous and it is the best in NY, the special side of wild mushrooms was wonderful, service excellent (we could not decide on which one out of 2 choices and the waiter suggested the $100 wine over the $120 one) and the bittersweet chocolate ice cream was worth killing for
We will be repeat customers for sure! The place is doing so much that is right
We waited almost an hour to get our table even though we had a reservation
The restaurant had a trendy vibe, and was crowded
It would be hard to maintain a conversation without raising your voice here
The seats were wooden, and a bit uncomfortable
For a steakhouse, the steak wasn't memorable- good, but not as flavorful or tender as I expected
Reservation for 7:15, figured wed be at a table by 7:30
Sat down at 10 after 8:00, 45+ minute wait with 4 different excuses from 4 different people is ridiculous
Appetizer specials were great, shrimp cocktail was awful
Filet- very good, Strip- okay, Ribeye- not good
The sides shine
The spinach was the best thing on the menu, the shrooms were soaked in reduction, and the goose fat potatoes were very decent
Strip house sauce was a pleasant surprise
Dessert was okay
The best thing about the place is the service
The wait staff is well trained, honest and courteous
Overall, the Strip House was a big disappointment
The steaks were overly peppered, and smaller than advertised
The service is better than most of the other NY Steakhouses, but the Steaks are not
A definite must for steak lovers! I had the NY Strip and it was the most delicious steak I've ever had
And, having grown up in the midwest I know good steak!!! The service was very good and the presentation was nice as well
Nice atmosphere and a good place to take a date
Expensive steaks but well worth the cost for the good quality
Interesting decor as the wall paper features nude women
Except for Peter Luger, I think this is the best steak house in New York -- way ahead of the others like Smith Wollensky, Ben Benson, etc
Although the prices are slightly higher, there is definitely a difference in quality and portion size
Also, lovely ambience and great service
We had 9PM reservations and weren't seated until 10 on a weekday
When we asked at 9:30 the doorstaff said that there were still tables in front of us
The crowd was mostly male and extremely loud
But hey, the steak was amazing
I was truely disappointed with the entire experience
My steak was sent back twice for being undercooked, then replaced with a cut just as poorly cooked
I returned it uneaten and asked for the check, my appetite now lost
My wife's steak on the other hand was OVERCOOKED, but she managed to eat half
When the bill came they had the audacity to charge me $20
00 for the uneaten steak which I promptly had removed
Not even a gesture for my ruined meal! We will NEVER return here
A steakhouse that cannot cook steak is worthless, and a restaurant that cannot recognize dissatisfaction is doomed

Their hamburger's were quite good also, but not on par with Paul's Palace
Good Show, Yanks! I will certainly eat here when I return
I've been eating at Pauls for the last 11 years and it is by far the best Burger in New York City! I've tried the other burgers at most of the top 10 spots on this list, and not one, (NOT ONE!) beats the Burgers at Pauls
These Burgers Freaken ROCK! Period! Now go and try one for yourself, and you better be hungry, cause Paul's ain't for dieters, light eaters, and vegetarians!
Paul's has the best burgers in NYC
Period
You get a huge juicy burger with some excellent steak fries for a very reasonable price
If you're looking for a great hamburger, look no further than Paul's
I live a few blocks from Paul's, and I go there at least a few times a week
The burgers are big and juicy, and they give you a lot of steak fries with the deluxe
I'd say I've been there in an upwards of 100 times, and the food has tasted good every time
I don't usually dine in though, so I wouldn't know about the experience
great burgers, all the pickles you can eat and a good selection of beer, what else could a person want?
Don't be fooled by the flame broiled burger scam
Burgers are best fried on a flat grill surface where they stay moist and juicy, just as they do it at Paul's
Unlike other joints, there really is a Paul, he is a great guy who will lead you to burger nirvana
Go once and you will never eat burgers anywhere else!
Paul's is by far the best burger joint in the city
I've since, taken my girlfriend there, friends and family and they all agree
Paul's is the best
The best part is that they will custom make any burger if it's not on the menu
And they know the difference between Medium, Rare and Well-done! Go there on an empty stomach
This stuff is what America is all about
Burgers are great, good choice of sides
Service is sometimes slow but worth the wait
Four to Five people can eat for the price of 2 in any other place
And they have Philly Chessesteaks!!!!
The burgers are really good here
However, the buns are soggy and service sucks
especially for take-out
they never get it right!!!! Eat-in for a okay experience
Great food in a friendly atmosphere
Huge burgers and meals are quick, good and inexpensive
and their hamburger tartar is to die for
Large servings, yummy burger
this place rocks
there are smaller sized tables so it is best for 1-4 people, really the best for 2 going to eat together
However there is stuff flying back and forth across the ceilings, great smells, and oh the anticipation of your burger
I am not sure how they do it, or why it is so different, but these burgers are unbelievable
cooked so well, but they stay soft somehow
just amazing
the only other place even close in nyc is corner bistro
Simply the best bugers in town
Wide variety of burger styles - all are winners
beef, grease, no-frills bun
What more could one need? Sweet potato fries are a nice addition
This is the best red meat on the face of the planet, I swear
I grew up in the midwest, and NEVER had a burger this good
If I lived near Pauls I would accept the fact I'm dying of a heart attack before 30
I recently ate at Paul's burger palace and I must say the burgers were a good as sex! It was juicy, the buns were soft and squishy, the onions and tomotos were sliced thin
OOOO
OOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I've tried them all and this is best I've had
Without a doubt, the Absolute Best and Tastiest Burgers in New York! Go ahead and go to the other places on this list (I have), and you will still wind up coming back to Paul's
The Burgers are just too good to pass up, and it's a fun place to eat
If you're hungry, and NOT on a diet, then there is no other place to eat a Great Tasting Burger than Paul's
My Favorite is the Very Juicy Bacon Burger smothered with Fried Onions and Cheddar Cheese!  Not only will the burgers blow you away, but the service at Paul's is downright Friendly and Sincere
Just ask all the Police Officers, Fire Fighters, EMS Techs, Eclectic Locals and Tourists that you will find committing the Sin of Gluttony there
You simply WILL NOT FIND a better burger, Period!
Paul's Palace has tasty juicy burgers - they are the right size with the right size buns
The burgers are about the best in the city
I used to work across the street from Paul's in 1989 and that's how we discovered the place
We live in Jersey now, but whenever we have a chance, we would go and eat the burgers at Paul's
Very tasty, huge burgers, great atmosphere
NEO
Juicy burgers bulging out of hearty buns
excellent fries and cold beer
Very reasonable prices
PLUS all those great, whimsical characters buzzing around the place that keep my 2-year-old daughter occupied throughout the meal
This place is paradise!
Man, just reading the reviews about Paul's is making me hungry
I stop in there a couple times a month and gorge myself on the City's biggest and best burgers
Needless to say, I have to crawl home more often than not, but I guess that's the price you pay for eating one of those masterpieces from paul's
If you are looking for a damn good burger Paul's is the place
They have a wide variety of choices and all toppings are served in abundance
The decor reminds me of a roadside diner along Route 66
This place is for all types, from trendy NYU'ers to sports lovers - games are always on
their burgers are unreal, they taste like a burger you would dream about say on a desserted island and satisfy that burger urge for months
Quality of meat is good enough to eat as tartar
Burgers any way you like it
The best toppings with fries to match
Definitely the best burger there is!
Burgers is what they do
About 50 different ones, plus you can create your own
Be prepared, they are huge!
It's hard to find burgers where you get what you ask for
Paul's is one of those few places where you get a medium-rare when you ask for medium rare
Milkshakes are pretty darn good, too
Waitstaff is awfully friendly
This restaurant is located in a great area
The food was good, as well as the service
They had great music playing, and there was plenty of entertainment in the back
Most of the games were playing and it was very comfortable
Plenty of room, cozy lighting and cool crew
They do have outdoor seating, and are very well know for their frozen drinks
Not the best service but the wings are by far the best I've had since I left Buffalo NY
Drinks are good too, espically the Beseme the Margaritas
This place is only recommended for an outdoor afternoon with a margarita on the sidewalk
Do not eat the food here, it's definitely over-rated
Well other reviews are right

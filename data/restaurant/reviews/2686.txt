My cousin and his wife were there this weekend and were served sushi w/ WARM RICE!!!! YUCK!
nothing really stood out for their sushi, hot foods appetizers
sushi was just ok the hot food also so so
prices seemed kind of hi
this place will have its following tho
SUM IT: if i had my druthers, i'd would rather go in the city for better sushi
but this is ok for the neighborhood
They are everywhere, the take-out delivery guys wearing New York Eats t-shirts, spanning the neighborhood on bikes or in those compact cars with the triangle plastic cap on the roof
Big portions of everything
Fast service
Everything fresh, the kitchen is right in the dining room, so there's no secrets
Good prices, they know how to feed the neighborhood
I love this place, great service, nice friendly workers and the food is excellent
It is definetly worth the trip
Saturday night is my favorite time to eat at this restaurant, since they have free live music
Go have a bite to eat
you will not regret it
Excellent food , quick service and very affordable
Two thumbs up !! Warning: you may become addicted
:)
Eats is a sure, why not? kind of diner
You'll stuff your face for fairly cheap prices and the food ain't so bad either
It's right on Queens Blvd, across the street from the el (7 line) and doesn't look like it belongs there - an extension in the back and a few couches would do it a lot of good
The service is ok, nothing out of the ordinary, and the eating area has been decorated nicely with murals and such
so sure, why not?
Seriously
All my friends are jealous that I live down the street from this place - the people who run it are sweethearts, the pizza is a really good deal (10 bucks for a large, and it comes with a free small), and it's absolutely delicious
They have a lot of other diner-type fare on the menu too
In Short Operating since 1960, Domino's is best known for its delivery service and pizzas arrive hot, thanks to the company's plugged-in HeatWave delivery-bag technology
Build your own pie--add toppings to either Ultimate Deep Dish, Crunchy Thin Crust or Classic Hand Tossed styles--or select a Feast Pizza, like the MeatZZa Feast, topped with pepperoni, ham, beef and Italian sausage
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix
It's sad that enough people order from this Domino's location to keep it in business
Anywhere else is understandable for factory-made pizza, but New York City??
Amazing appetizers, amazing seafood, amazing salad, amazing drinks
Didi I mention amazing??? Mezzo Mezzo is a beautiful, charismatic and welcoming restaurant
The food is wonderful as is the waitstaff, who are both friendly and knowledgeable
A wonderful experience from start to finish
Oh, they also have a lounge upstairs too, which is always fun
Definitely highly recommend!!!
I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed
I've always had good service, and the food is wonderful! You might have to wait for your bill, but just get your server and tell them you are ready for it
its nice to sit at a nice place and not feel rushed to leave after the meal is finished
FYI: They do have a kids menu with chicken strips and burgers, just ask
We've stopped at this local eatery a number of times, for convenience and great outdoor seating
Each time we hope it won't be as bad as the last
The service is horrendous
It's unfortunate because the food is generally pretty good, although the waitstaff did try to convince us once that the flan they gave us was really creme brulee
Today was the last day we will ever stop there
We waited 25 minutes for 1 coffee and a mimosa, they told us the bartender was making it from scratch
We ordered food which was meant to be hot but didn't show up that way and then waited another 20 minutes for the check before searching for it ourselves
Always a disappointing and frustrating experience
Wineturtle dropped in for lunch over the Memorialday weekend, they had a nice crowd for a normally slooow period ;first good sign

I had the most beautiful unforgettable exprience at Mezzo-Mezzo
I had my wedding rehearsal dinner there with my 17 person wedding party and it was unbelievable!! The customer service was soooo great! They really bent backwards for us
They even stood open later than they do too! The overall ambiance is nice, but the upstairs is gorgeous!!! They have outdoor seating too
It is a cool eclectic artsy cafe
I highly recommend!
I went to Mezzo Mezzo with a big group of 14 people and had a very enjoyable time
The staff was very open to us and allowed us to mingle and talk before dinner in addition to handling the special needs of our party
The portions were huge and the upstairs area had comfy couches with a firelplace and live singers with guitars the night we were there
All of the staff couldn't have been more hospitable and I would definately recommend it to a group
We went on a Sunday night
Wow! Not only were their cookies delicious, but the service i received was incredible
i called 7 bakeries in the area to deliver something for me to a family in mourning and not only did the owner, anna go to the post office herself to have it shipped, but she picked up a sympathy card for me as well! Unbelievable! It isn't everyday that you come accross people so willing to help others in need
This is the sleeper right here folks
This is the best slice of Sicilian pizza I've had in Queens for certain and probably anywhere
This is a bakery, and a fine one at that
But they also make only sicilian pizza
Now that I've started working out, I've had to cut back, but it hurts
The crust is buttery and crunchy and the sauce is incredible
Plus Joe of Rose and Joe is a really nice guy
Have a slice
Take home a tray, but enjoy this pizza
No frills, No bells and whistles, No LINE
simply put the best sicillian slice onearth for the last 30 years
On any day of the week, anyone in the Ditmars neighborhood can stop by La Guli and get a taste of one of Astoria's most established pastry shops
Their treats are decently sized, fresh and abundant, and reasonably priced
Its a great place to pick up treats for the kids, for gifts to others, or just to fulfill that sugary craving that exists within many of us
The place is small, but loaded with plenty of goodies that range from Italian inspired treats to Greek pastries all well prepared
Recommended for many occasions
Its that special type of local pastry shop that you get nostalgic about when youre traveling around the world
Always saying in my head I would love some Gulis right now
This is the place that should be landmark for what it truly is
It is your perfect little local pastry shop that has helped define Astoria along with its many fine restaurants
Queens knows its pastries, and La Guli is the queen
From cannolis to gelati and everything in between, classic Italian desserts and breads are made with love and perfection
A neighborhood staple that I learned to love from my Queens-bred family at a VERY young age
You won't be disappointed!

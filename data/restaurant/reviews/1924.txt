The authentic food is always fresh and portions large
The servers are nice too
I recommend the specials
Okay, so it's not the *best* pizza in NY, but it is good for a quick mid-day snack while shopping around Nolita
The pizza is decent, the fare is simple
The service?
could use some work
We waited 45 minutes (yes 45minutes) for a chicken roll
they said it was baking, but I at 12pm, the baking should be done and ready to heat serve, don't you think? Cute outside tables to ppl watch
With a huge image hanging inside of E-Street Band Rock Great, Bruce Springstein Eating a Thin Crust Slice
It is Symbolic of the Great taste of their Pizza, Calzones, Rolls and Garlic Knots
The Cheese is always right, the Crust always Perfect the sauce always fresh and steaming
And they Serve Beer
Bleeker Streets Pizza Booth is definetly the Best Pizza Place In NYC
I have been to Pizza Booth countless times after nights out with my friends
It is my favorite pizza place
I made my friends walk from another neighborhood just to eat the pizza there one time! They weren't happy but I was once I ate the spinach and tomato slice! Too good!
In Short From the outside, Bar 89 looks like an exclusive club with a blank faade and black-clad bouncer
Diners dress the part, too: Models clad in couture sip fruit-infused 'tinis at the arced mahogany bar; Soho-alites, rocking the latest $400 jeans, fill the black leather booths and coyly gorge on mounds of nachos, grilled cheese, herb-salted fries and burgers topped with everything from fried onions to Alfredo sauce
Going to this BAR 89/restaurant was a great experience
I loved the bathrooms
I initially wanted to go there just for the bathrooms but the food and drinks was delicious
You gotta try the buffalo wings!!! We celebrated one of our girlfriend's bachelorette party there
I went to Bar 89 several months ago with a girlfriend
On a Friday night at 8:00, we were seated promptly w/o a reservation
I had the Burger Au Poivre II, which has crumbled blue cheese and bacon, and I craved it again for weeks afterward
I also had a coconut martini, which was delish as well
I found the service unpretentious and loved the decor
The food is surprisingly good, the ambience is relaxing, and the service was unpretentious
I was told the art work installation changes periodically
One must use the bathroom at least once
A good place to rest and eat a little after shopping in Soho; slightly pricy but affordable
I don't drink so I can't comment on them but the bar was packed
I think some people never had good fruity drinks to know the difference
It's just an upscale diner, the only haute clients must have found a place with better ambiance
As for the food you are better off buy a tv dinner
I just called to ask about reservations for my birthday party for 12 people and the guy who answered the phone was extremely rude
I had enjoyed the place before however this definitely put me off
Instead of being nice and working with me he was competely rude
I will definitely let my friends know that bar 89 does not care about its customers
What a shame!
The space is still slick and very comfortable, the bathrooms still amaze, it is still a cool haven on a sticky NYC day; but it's not really a place to go for the food, nor for special drinks
Several times I've eaten here, I've always had a large amount of wilting fruit slices on garnishing my dish
The Buffalo Chicken salad has a dispraportionate amount of blue chees and sauce, smothering all other flavors
The delightful thick bacon in the BLTs is not complemented by the feably soft bread
The Bloodys are different each time and are usually on the sweet side
And this Summer's special Front Porch Iced Tea tastes like it is full of corn syrup, like one of those giant deli-bought southwestern iced-teas with a hint of vodka
Have a beer, a simple martini or a glass of wine, enjoy the ambience and then go somewhere else
This place is AWESOME! The 1st time I visited Bar 89 was 5 years ago - and today, the Bar is still fabulous, still sceney, and still one of the BEST BAR/RESTAURANT's in NEW YORK! THey have incredible drinks and incredibly reasonable pricces for food! Everytime I walk into Bar 89 there's a different artst display that captivates me as i dine! This place is truly a gem
and one of the best kept secrets in NY!
Models frequent this SoHo hot-spot to sip champagne and not eat vegetable plates (which are really amazing, so you should eat them!)
In-the-know New Yorkers come for the fab ahi salad, filling burgers (veggie and cow, both rockin') and, well, the bathrooms
Just check them out, they're the coolest
I went there to celebrate my birthday and had a pretty large crowd of about 10 confirmed and a few other possible
It was after work on a Thursday so the place was getting packed
They were very helpful in finding an area for us all and when more people than expected came, they were very accommodating in trying to make the fit with the rest of the party
The food ordered, some had appetizers and others main courses, arrived in a timely fashion
Our drinks were always correct, regardless of how many were ordered at one time
It was a mix crowd and you didn't feel like an outsider
The bathroom, of course, are fun
There was always someone scared to go in
we had placed an order for the wings combo platter and waited for 30 minutes before getting the food
the drinks, however, came in a more timely manner
when someone from our table of 5 asked the waitress for refill on water, she comes back and fills only that person's glass, leaving the rest of the table with almost empty glasses
and when we asked her back to fill the rest of the glasses, she gives attitude


Went with a party of 6 and found the food to be on the rather poor
greasy burgers, a tad cold and nothing to write home about
About half of us felt unwell at the end of the evening
I think we got a bad batch of nachos
In essence its slightly upmarket junk food
and only upmarket because of the price hike
This place is great- great atmosphere and great food and drinks! They make burgers, sandwiches, nachos and wings - basic foods but they make them really GOOD! The service is really friendly and the bathrooms are really COOL
Drinks are potent and large :)
VERY COOL PLACE, HUGE MARTINI'S, THE UNISEX BATHROOMS ARE VERY COOL, EXCELLENT DESSERTS
WILL DEFINETLY GO BACK
A good place to go if you want to get something to eat after shopping in Soho
Although the menu is somewhat limited to appetizers and sandwiches, everyone can usually find something they like
The burgers are excellent especially the one with the jalapenos
A lot of people go just to check out the unisex bathroom
a good place for a casual but not slobby dinner
Had lunch here
grilled cheese was excellent and very filling
Great spot to grab lunch, great atmosphere
Bathrooms are pretty cool, a lot different than I expected
Drinks are a little pricey but are hip nontheless
The service was top-notch
Everyone was very friendly and the food was very good
My friends and I met there on a Friday night and had a great time! The food is delicious and very well priced and so were the drinks and you even get free coat check
I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant
Guaranteed great food, drinks and ambiance
If that's not enough the bathrooms alone are worth going for!! I'll definitely be back there!
Drinks were costly, but good, food was great, and i've never seen a bathroom like it
I would go there everyday, if I lived in the area
Bar 89 looks like what it is; an over-decorated diner with a nightlife
The food here is actually pretty damned good; portabella sandwich is delicious, and grilled cheese is above par
Appetizers are less exciting than they sound
All dishes are pretty large, and come with an assortment of extras, though side dishes seem to vary on an arbitrary system (fruit? vegetables? fries?)
Share with someone (but don't tell the waiter - extra charge)

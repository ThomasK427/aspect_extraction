He is the GREATEST, always compliments the women and takes great care of all

Enough Said!! Simply the best steakhouse in New York City
The other don't even come close
Quite possibly some of the best steak I have ever had
The creamed spinach is to die for
This place is a power-business hangout
I'd recommend men wear a jacket or you'll feel out of place
Great for drinks and people-watching
It's easily walking distance from time-square (around 4 blocks)
yummmyyy!  i went on a thurs night and it was super busy
service is top notch if you are buddy buddy with the maitre'd
did not have to wait at all
Whether it be 11am or 11pm, this place always seems to be packed
If you want to impress your guests with friendly service, a spectacular wine list, consistently great food, and an overall feeling of being part of a scene, then this is your steakhouse
I'll admit, it's a little pricey, but if you have a corporate card on hand, or just need a central location to celebrate a special occasion, it's worth making a reservation
I dined here on Christmas Eve and I was amazed at how warm and enthusiastic the staff was, when surely many of them would rather be elsewhere
If you can't afford a bottle of Cakebread, order a glass of Penfolds
And if you want a bargain, stop by early and enjoy the prefix menu -- while also enjoying the view
It's a single girls dream
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BLOWN AWAY BY A DINING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE
FROM THE SECOND WE WERE SEATED, OUR WAITER WAS THE GREATEST
THE STEAKS MELTED LIKE BUTTER IN OUR MOUTHS, THE CRABCAKE AND THE POTATOES WERE PERFECT
I WILL NEVER FORGET MY EXPERIENCE AND PLAN TO TAKE EVERYONE I KNOW THERE
KEEP UP THE SPECTACULAR WORK GUYS
Its service is one of the best so far
The prime ribeye was excellent
The staffs were very attentive
The table that we were seated was occupied by the Rock about half hour prior to our seating
I believe the table is called the point
The lemon cake and the scotch cheesecake were delightful
I don't usually like the chain restaurant, but this one is the exception
Yet, parking was a little difficult
We like it so much that we are thinking to have our son's third year old birthday there

I went here for a Grgich Hills vintner's dinner and had - no exaggeration - the BEST dinner of my life
The dinner was five courses of exquisite quality - well, perhaps four as dessert was only adequate compared to the wonders that went before
It was very expensive - around $200 a plate - but it was worth every penny
Highly recommended
I dined here with a few financier colleagues for Prix Fixe Friday
PFF is year round at this midtown eatery and I challenge you, reader, to find a better prix fixed meal this side of the Mason Dixon Line
The decor is nice for a steakhouse and the waitresses serve perfect steaks and serve as nice eyecandy while chomping down on your perfect slab of beef
This would be a prime location for a power business lunch
I would consider myself to be a PFF Coneisuer and this is the best front to back meal I have had
The salad was delicious, steak mouthwatering, and the Soufle was perfect
No downside to this restaurant
Del Frisco is Del-icious
I thought that Del Friscos was a wonderful steakhouse
Our waitress was very attentive and the food was promptly served
The atmosphere was a little loud but being mostly businessmen, that was to be expected
Overall I would definately revisit Del Friscos! And their pineapple martini was amazing as was their turtle soup which i was too quickly dubious about!
I'm not much a steak-lover, but I have to say this is the only steakhouse I will go to over and over again
I must've eaten here over a dozen times now and everytime we have guests from out of town come and visit us, we ALWAYS take them here
Their steaks are awesome (I usually order the ribeye)and their service is wonderful
Once, they prepared my husband's steak incorrectly, so they took it back and redid it but what surprised me was, at the end of the meal, they gave us 5 different desserts, all compliments of the house for messing up his order
That was a very pleasant surprise to us
I am not a promoter of any kind for this restaurnant, but simply, a resident of the city who comes to this restaurant all the time because the experience is CONSISTENTLY great here
I have been to the Del Frisco's in Orlando, FL and was elated to find one here as well in NY
The place never fails - it is always a winner
The steaks are cooked perfectly and taste wonderful
No one compares in my book
The side dishes are great too and big enough to share with the table
The service is always top notch as well!
We had the very fortunate opportunity to eat at Del Frisco's in Las Vegas in May, 2004
It was a wonderful experience
All of the staff were very polite and helpful
The food was a true dining experience
We were extremely happy to learn that there is a Del Frisco's on the East coast in New York (we live in New Jersey) and cannot wait to compare the two with respect to service and food
Our steaks were outstanding and cooked exactly the way we wanted them (with the help of our excellent waiter)
And there is much to be said about the great sides (vegetables)
It was a true dining experience
I would like to add that the decor and atmosphere was very classy and romantic
Thank you
Looking forward to trying out your restaurant in New York - real soon
Excellent food, atmosphere, service and staff
Very accommodating to customers requests
Even sends follow-up thank you letter and welcomes you back

Great decor, and the food is even better
Awesome steaks and side dishes, great salads, and the most incredible desserts
Try the molten chocolate souffle
it's a great place
Don't miss the crab cakes either, pricey but worth every penny
Like many of you out there, I pride myself on my ability to accurately rate each steak house I go to on everything from food, to service, to experience, attitude, etc
etc
Del Frisco's is far and away the absolute best steak house in Manhattan
Its FOOD, (above all else) its service, its location and decor
The best
No question
Unfortunately for the editor of citysearch, the crab cakes are one of the major reasons I got hooked
They are full of flavor, and worth every cent
I don't work for Del Friscos, and Im unbiased
but Ive been to them all, and this is just unfair misrepresentation
Thanks
Fabulous steaks, and we have tried a lot of fine steakhouses
Great waiter, colin, great peoplewatching, INCREDIBLE wine list, and the butterscotch cheesecake for dessert was so incredibly light it was sinful - spectacular night, really loved this place
Great location walking downtown
A bit of a wait even w/a reservation but so worth it
ENJOY!
I was a little concerned about the editorial staff's Lone Star mention, but this place exceeded every expectation

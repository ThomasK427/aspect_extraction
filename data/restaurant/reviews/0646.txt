I've been a number of times and the food has been consistently good
The crepes and scones were delicious and fresh
The sandwiches were all tasty too
As for the price, it's not at all comparable to expensive high teas
It's much cheaper
The price is comparable to most brunch places in new york
The service is excellent
The servers aren't breathing down your neck, they leave you to enjoy your meal
Alice's Tea Cup is more about the ceremony of tea rather than good tea
If you're not a big tea drinker or enjoy 'fruit teas', then you probably won't notice and will leave relatively content
The food was okay - I enjoyed my croque madame and accompanying salad
(The cucumber sandwhich, however, was awful)
As for my tea, it was not hot and evidently, there must have been a fruit tea in the pot before b/c there was a distinct fuity aroma coming from my black tea
Because the cafe is below ground and has no windows, it's probably a better place to stop by in colder weather
Also, as I was there on a weekend, it was extremely loud
Although it was not a bad expereince, it was not memorable either
Overall, it's a nice place for mothers and daughters which appear to be the primary clientele
Perfect place for brunch or tea
Great for little kids girly girls of all ages
It's also a fantastic respite during an afternoon of shopping, movies or schlepping around the Upper West Side
The only edible food item in this place is the scone
Everything else is horrible
The smoked salmon sandwich must have been sitting in room temperature for hours
The egg salad was tasteless
The worst part has to be the service
It is nonexistant and leads to an unacceptable wait
The price is comparable to high tea at a nice hotel
Where the food is actually fresh and there is service
Admittedly the decor is cute but it's nothing special
I don't know why anyone would bother
We have been going to Alice's since they opened
It is such a whimsical place
My daughter loves the Alice theme, I love the service and the food
They have converted me from coffee to tea drinker
The owners are so very hospitable
Thank you so much Lauren and Hailey
The place has become quite popular, and it does get crowded during the weekend; it is more relaxing on weekdays
I love Alice's
I've never had a bad meal, and the tea is excellent freshly brewed
Scones are heavenly (never dry) change all the time, so you never get bored
The salad with tea-smoked chicken is also a favorite
All food is fresh incredibly flavorful
Atmosphere is truly enjoyable, a real refuge in a crazy city
It's like having a meal in a country inn
Super delicous
Also a great place to pick up a small gift for a friend like a book or photo album
This is the perfect place for a quiet, peaceful tea on a rainy afternoon
Subdued, charming, small but not too small, just right for you and a couple of friends as an alternative to the crowded weekend brunch or for when you just feel like sitting alone to read and sip some tea and nibble on their great scones
The menu is great--not overwhelming but enough to offer something to everyone, plentiful teas to choose from, and the price isn't hard on the wallet
I'm coming back here whenever I need a little escape
The Scene Like Tudor City's secluded streets and courtly buildings, L'Impero seems untouched by time or trend
Hidden behind an Italianate courtyard, past a cozy, blue-lit nook of a bar, sits an unpretentious, split-level dining room warmed by tall candelabras
An all-ages crowd eases into teal and plum banquettes, pampered by outstanding service
The Food The rousing, Italian-inspired menu marries rich, country-rustic cooking with the light, bright flavors of the sea
Cranberry bean soup, flecked with root vegetables and smoky speck, is as satisfying and texturally thrilling as its culinary antipode, three intensely-flavored raw seafood compositions
Pastas are riveting: reduced Passito wine and salty Parmigiano tempers to-die-for foie gras-duck agnolotti; garlicky gnocchi tangle with snails and porcini; miniscule calamari and creamy sea urchin boost briny squid-ink pasta
Simple main dishes, like succulent roasted Vermont-raised baby goat, outshine busier ones: Too many flavors ruin a short-rib, tripe and sirloin trio
I visited this place sometime back, we had reservations but was still asked to wait at the bar for a couple of minutes which was fine
The bar is really nice (kind of small though)
We were seated by the nice hostess
Our waitress was friendly but very quirky
The food was good
The crowd in this place is a much older mature crowd
Nice place to take your parents
The restaurant itself was kind of loud
Very upscale restaurant, excelent for a business lunch/dinner
Although it's costly, you get exactly what you pay for
I've come twice, both times for special occasions, and I've yet to be fed a bad dish
I'm a big fan of the pre-fix menu with wine pairing
I believe the menu is different for each day of the week, but from what I've seen, there is always something new and exciting
There isn't much to say about the atmosphere as I found it somewhat average, but the service makes up for it
Truly a place for the 50+ crowd
The food was quite nice but i felt out of place in what was an older crowd
The service was OK
Slow and deliberate
If it wasn't for the quality and presentation of the food i would have dissliked the place overall
But the food was teriffic, especially the pasta's
Wine was overpriced and the sommelier was not helpful
A place to bring your parents
Had been waiting some time to come, it was worth the wait!!! Prix Fix is the way to go
We were a party of four, we each ordered differently and passed aorund, got to try 4 entrees, 4 apps, 4 pastas and we ordered the crab risotto to share
Service was oustanding, food was pefect!! You will not be disappointed!!!
After reading all the bad reviews, I was prepared and bracing myself for absolutely terrible service, but from the minute I arrived at the restaurant the food and service was spectacular!  The prix-fixe menu had many options and every dish was delicious
The only minor glitch during the evening was that the staff brought out the wrong entrees twice
It wasn't a big deal as we were not waiting long for the food and to make up for it, we were comped all beverages (including wine) and anything extra we ordered outside of the prix-fixe menu
The wait staff was more than congenial and friendly with great menu and wine suggestions
I haven't had such a great dining experience in a long time
The 4-course Prix Fixe is an amazing value, allowing you to experience an Italian meal as it is meant to be experienced
The food is expertly prepared and full of delicate and intriguing flavors
Trust me- get the duck and foie gras pasta, it's absolutely delicious
Excellent service and great ambiance round out this wonderful dining experience
I've already been here twice for lunch and have always been pleased with the high quality of food and impeccable service
The lunch menu is a great bargain, which includes dessert
Presentation of food is excellent and the menu's variety makes it a successful venue for business lunch
It's both casual and formal at the same time, and the muted colors works well to create a relaxed ambience
I highly recommend this place and think the chef has an excellent eye and palate for presentation, taste, and texture
L'Impero is truly a wonderful restaurant
We ate outside and, for a second, you think you're not in Manhattan
The food is fantastic, specifically, the fish dishes, however, I felt the waiters to be very arrogant and rude
We tried to make conversation with one of the them and he blew us off

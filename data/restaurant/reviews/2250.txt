Very delicate
and the eggplant they used
I don't know what they did, but it was the best I've ever had! The bread pudding was very nice, unique, and tastefully presented
Service was very gracious
Molyvos was absolutely delicous
I have never had better greek food or more wonderful serivce
The atmosphere is warm and festive
The staff delightful
I truly recommend that you all enjoy in this dining experience
The lamb chops and baklavah were outrageous
Worth every penny and more
Molyvos is certainly unlike the tavernas and restaurants I have visited in Greece, but the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is welcoming and soothing
I had lunch there yesterday with 2 friends, and the service was quick and thoughtful, and the food delicious
We each had the lamb sandwich, which we all loved, which comes with a wonderful little Greek salad
The round baklava was also delicious, and the house blend herbal tea was a nice finish
great food, service, and wine
If you are looking for Greek food - this is the place!
food and wine was superb; service as well
highly recommended mid-town greek food
We went to Molyvos last night, good food but nothing special
The service staff is well trained
Very good wine list
This restaurant is certainly one of the best the city has to offer
The food was incredible, as was the service
I would definitely come back
My comfy little restaurant never disappoints
Decor is minimal but, cleanly maintained
The food is dotty
It's hit and miss
I would stick with the sushi menu or staples like chicken teriyaki
That being said, they get sushi right on! The Dragon roll is delicious and my favorite thing there
Menu prices are LOW
Lunch draws the huge business/tourist crowd who know a good cheap eats place when they see one
Avoid lunch as you'll wait forever for a table
i go to kikku about twice a week and they never let me down
service is ALWAYS prompt
great fresh sushi at a great value make this place a real midtown gem
By far better than any of the fast food sushi places with catchy names, Kikku is about the same price and worth every penny! Its location makes it an undiscovered gem in Midtown, sshh
don't tell
where else can you get tea, soup, and a full sushi lunch for under $10???
I've only had take out from here so I can't comment on the ambiance, but the food is great
You get plenty of food for the price, enough leftovers for lunch and they actually serve garlic chicken with lots of chicken and chinese vegetables
not just broccoli!
They have the best General Tso's Chicken
I tried many and this place tops it
Lots of food for the money
The info is incorrect
They DO NOT have a private room at all
I asked them when I went to have dinner and they looked at me puzzled and said, This is all we have
Just go for the food though
i have been to this restaurant a couple of times and the service has been consistently great
the food is average quality for the price but the staff and ambiance make it a wonderful place to eat without busting your wallet
i especially like their pad si iew and hot thai tea
The food here is very good, although it is slightly more expensive than Thai places downtown
I usually order chicken, and it tastes great, especially the Pad Thai
The soup is not as good, though, as some other places
I highly recommend at least trying it once
And each time I go, the taste of food is consistent, which is rare at least in NY
Seeda Thai has a great menu and very pleasant staff
For an affordable meal this is a wonderful place! The chicken curry in coconut milk was delicious and just the right kind of spicy
The restaurant touts JFK, Jr
as one of its most famous patrons
Overall, an excellent dining experience!
This place has the BEST pad see ewe thats not even on the menu
but they were serve on request, and most amazing peanut sauce
I loved thai food until I had seeda, and now I won't eat thai anywhere else
That must be an old photo tho because the sign looks different
and I have been eating there for a year now
Amidst Midtown's high-rise buildings Columbus Circle's glitzy boutiques sits an unassuming store-front catering to those seeking a higher cup
There's a bit of a downtown feeling at Reunion, it's as if it set itself up in New York before knowing where the gourmet coffee shops are supposed to be- and never bothered to move
It doesn't quite fit in w/ the rest of the nabe, and this out-of-place polish only adds to it's charm
Neighborhood residents, 9-to-5ers, and in-the-know Time Warner shoppers refuel on some of the city's best coffee at this small shop
The service is friendly if somewhat perfunctory; they brew a tasty cup- hot, fresh, and -most importantly- really, really strong
Note: While the coffee's good, there's little to no seating: Take your Cup O' Joe to go
The decor obviously hasn't changed since they opened in '59
The pre-dinner bread is hard and chewy in a bad way
The main courses display a complete lack of imagination
My seared tuna was cooked through and was simply a piece of meat
no seasame seeds, no salt/pepper, nothing
The vegetable side dish reminded me of my third grade lunch room
Imagine our surprise to actually find such a fine establishment right in the heart of the theatre district or close enough anyway
The service was wonderful and responsive, ambience very nice, food excellent and reasonably priced
Even the restrooms was immaculate! We will definitely return to this wonderful restaurant
They talked about traditional Thai but the dishes look more fusion than their traditional COSTUME
Whatever happen to FAMILY STYLE Thai cooking, the portion are too small and tradtional thai cooking uses MSG which I prefer not to have in my body
After all, I'm still searching for that delicious thai cooking
But here, wasn't it but was a disappointment
There're so many thai food on ninth avenue that you can't just look good but your food has to be also
We ate at this place yesterday
The food was fine
The ambience was in the Thai traditional old style but acceptable one
The service was fine
Good to try out
I have been ordering in from this place since I read reviews here
I love spicy food, and they really make it spicy when I tell them to! But their quantity for entrees is low compared to other Thai places, and it is more oily
I don't know about the ambience since I usually order in, but the food is definitely good, and they deliver fast
I've only heard good things about this place and usually don't judge by cover (good or bad) and can't really say anything pos
or neg
about this place in general; but what i can warn is to stay away from the red snapper! it should really be described as sliced ginger with some kind of fish underneath
the texture was definitely fish but the taste was a painful amount of ginger (and i do like ginger) infused with misc

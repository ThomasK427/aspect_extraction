Stumbled in with reservations but was seated promptly and courteously
Waitress was friendly
Food was OK but great service and value for money
Nice dessert and huge cup of coffee
Ladies room was very clean
Food and location are great
Very lively and bustling
Would definitely come here again for lunch
Our dinner was a disaster
After we were seated and ordered our meals, we were asked to move because the restaurant had overbooked
They moved us upstairs to an area where they were setting up for a private party -- we had no server, and had to flag down people setting up for the party to get us drinks, silverware, water, etc
Then, we were asked to move AGAIN because the private party was about to start
When I told the manager about it, he apologized and gave me his card and told me to come back and he would give me a discount
Considering the absolute ridiculousness of being asked to move TWICE, I will never be using that card
On top of the horrible service, the food was very average
Very nice design when compared to other midtown latino restaurants
Still going through some growing pains week 6 but improving steadily
The food is good, the after work scene is also very good
The service is sometimes spotty but not for lack of trying
This place opened a year or two ago in my neighborhood so we decided to try them out (back then)
The seafood empanada I got was mushy and parts were cold inside - as though they were frozen and sent in
I suspect they all are
Service was incredibly slow
Yet there is a Time Out review framed in their storefront
the folks at TONY must be asleep at the wheel because this place is an insult to the few remaining other great and authentic restaurants in the neighborhood
Not worth eating here
You get the same or if not better empanandas on a street corner on the upper west-side
I ordered the chicken tamamles and it was soggy inside like cream of wheat
The young lady taking the order had no personality, was slow to the point that it took 10 minutes to get 2 empanadas just to go and even then she didn't put napkins or plastic-ware inthe take out bag
I was short 1 cent and she wasn't willing to write it off
I am afraid to post a really good review of Empanada mama in fear of losing it to others
the pizza empanadas have no comparison and the mango shake is to die for
How hard can it be to be courteous, smile, and provide good service at a counter service restaurant? Obviously, very hard
The people that work there don't want to be there, give plenty of attitude, and make you feel unwelcome
Don't go near closing because they put the chairs up on tables 15 minutes before closing
When you get the food, they are tiny
Since they are so tiny, they should really offer orders of 6 like McNuggets
If they could be nice, listen to what you say, smile, and say thank you, it would be make for a better experience
Glad the engine selected this station
didn't need much gentrification but good additions are always welcome
Not sure if i like the food or the service better
This restaurant has the perfect combination of great food, great ambience, and great service
The dry-aged steak and yellowtail appetizer are a MUST TRY
The ambience is trendy, yet conservative enough for a business dinner
Service is top notch
I used to eat at the Wild Tuna before Mainland took over the place
When Mainland open its doors I was ready to sample the goods
My favorite dish in any Chinese restaurant has always been the Peking duck
Chef's special Crispy Duck for two served table side was the first choice at the Mainland
My score for the duck was 80 over 100
It was good, nicely cooked, fat removed and served with the usual sides but I had better ones
I enjoyed the lamb rolls as appetizer and bottle of Shiraz
Becasue it was just open the service not in place but I hear things got a lot better now
I am hoping to visit again to see how things are now but until then I would be happy to stop by for a glass of wine at the bar and maybe have the lamb rolls again
It is outstanding
that's all I can say
I could not wait to review mainland as the meal is haunting me and I will be back very, very often!
I went to Mainland with an unsure feeling after a lukewarm review from the Times
How glad I am my friend dragged me there! The lounge/bar is really beautiful with lots of comfy club chairs and banquettes and perfect service
Our server was really warm and reccomended one of the specialty cocktails which was awesome
(3 kingdoms I think) We were then taken to our table where the level of service was continued and the food was amazing! Beef short ribs are a must as well as a selection of dumplings
Next time we're getting the Peking duck, which they roll out and carve tableside! This place is truly a wonderful experience!
My boyfriend and I just stumbled upon Miriam's early on a Friday night
We were inticed by the specials listed on the board outside- and we quickly found the place to be everything we expected and more! The waitress was very knowledgeable and gave us excellent recommendations
The menu was unique and hard to choose from
I highly recommend the Mediterranean Salad--diced avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, and pine nuts, wrapped in grilled eggplant strips
Delicioso! The lamb chops are to die for, and the striped bass was interesting and pleasing to the taste buds
Large portions and reasonable prices for the quality that accompanies the exciting taste and experience that is Miriam!
The fish dishes were overcooked but tasty and interesting
We enjoyed the chopped salad but the meal itself lacked the frrrrresh seasoning and wasn't as good as the one we had on our last visit
we were the only couple in the restaurant and the vibe was kind'a strange
what's with the bar lights?
Seven of us met for dinner and we all ordered different things and not a single meal was a disappointment
The fish dishes were the best, seasoned perfectly with interesting and tasty side dishes
We loved the white bait appetizer
The drinks at the bar before dinner were a highlight
The bartender seemed genuinely happy to have us there and he was easy on the eyes,,,
i have eaten at Miriam's a few times for brunch and it is always great
the food and the service is above par
the waitress (i have had the same one each time) is always very attentive
the food is also very good, especially many of the egg dishes
it is a very welcoming place where you can relax on a saturday or sunday morning
Well, most of it
Yes, the first experience I had was horrendous (probably just one of those nights), but my boyfriend and I received a personal invitation to come back to alter our initial opinion
We did and we enjoyed it
The server was friendly and knowledgeable
The braised veal was tender and succulent
The kugle, he said, was on par with his mothers recipe
For a time we were the only people in the restaurant but we never felt rushed
We even asked for a break between entrees and desserts and she did it gladly
Thanks, Miriam, for a wonderful evening!
We tried this place with a group of 6 last weekend after glowing reviews
It seems that many of the reviewers have dined in a near empty restaurant but it was completely full at 8pm on a recent Saturday
While friendly, the staff just couldn't juggle that many customers and the service suffered tremendously
After receiving only 2 menus for whole group, nobody came back for another 15 minutes
Our bottle of wine took another 15 to arrive and the appetizers took over half an hour
We got 4 glasses for the wine and were told that they ran out of clean glasses
The food was very good but the portions are pretty small, so while the prices are low, the place is not quite a bargain it seems to be
Just came back from a Friday night dinner, we were the only people in the restaurant - the white bait is tasty, jerusalem bread is interesting, but not for $6 for three little pieces, the grilled halumi salad was fantastic though
What's most disconcerting is, despite the previous reviewers claims of a mega-friendly owner, we saw hide nor hair of anyone being friendly to us, again, as the only ones in the restaurant for more than an hour

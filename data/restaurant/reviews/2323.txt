No mind you there was no room to is at the bar because of the world cup quater finals
Since we already have our drinks there is no choice, so we are forced to pay full price
Then our burgers had the smallest serving of fries I have seen
Yet, no patato skins
So we just start eating, now mind you we are also being ignored by this waitress
Half way through eating the server notices finaly that we don't have the patato skinds and goes to find out what happened
She comes to tell us that they did make them
Although they were so burnt and small that they cant serve them to us
She asked if you wanted anything else instead
We desided to get some nachos instead
Well after alot more of being ignored
I even at one point had my credit card out in plain sight on the table and she just walked right past us
It was so bad my date had to walk home, across the street were we live mind you
To rest people we were forced to wait there for so long
Once I did get a bill after half a hour of waiting for it
I noticed that I was charged $11
99 for the plate of nachos
That we only ordered because she was offering nice they ruined our order
I expected it to be comped or at least half off
No full price, when the patato skinks I wanted was $5
99
Now the $12 plate of nachoes was the most pathetic serving I have ever saw
It was so small I was hoping it was free, because that was all it was worth
This is just one horrible experience after another
My firend and I decided to eat here after being here on a Friday night and enjoying the bar atmosphere that night
The BBQ smelled great and we were looking forward to it
We both ordered the same thing, 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken
It comes with corn on the cob, slaw and pickles
We were very disappointed
The corn was cold
cold as in barely cooked
The 1/2 rack of ribs were defined by the owners as 3 ribs only
and they forgot the slaw
we had to ask for it
The only thing that made the meal palatable was the very kind waitress who by now, should be looking for another place to work if she wants to make any tips
The meal cost us with 2 diet cokes, $40 plus a generous tip
total $48 for crap
My advice, go there to drink
don't waste the time on food
We live a few blocks from Copperfield's and go there all the time
It's a very laid-back place and the wait staff has always been very nice to us, if not always the quickest
We love their DC blackened burger and their pulled pork
It's an easy place to go where you know you'll get reliable food and almost always a table immediately
The place is terrible
I live less than one block away from Copperfield's and use to go there all the time
They have recently fired their staff and brought in new people who dont even know how to serve a beer, I might add you are on average paying $6
50 to dink on the upper east side
The place is always empty and attracks no one
The food is terrible and also over priced with the menu never changing
Also, the biggest thing is the owners, they are extremly rude
I would never step foot in that place again
Save your money or go to the bars on second avenue, much nicer scene
I am not a big user of Citysearch
I admit it
However, I visited a restaurant recently, enjoyed my experience, and was doing some web surfing when I noticed these reviews
First off, these one-review wonders are no doubt enemies of the restaurant for whatever reason
Copperfield's is great
Great food, good service and an incredibly nice ambiance with wonderful beers, perhaps the biggest selection I have ever seen in one place at one time
The manager who greeted me was friendly and seemed busy all night with assisting the servers and bartenders
Don't believe the negativity, and they don't even serve a cheese plate of any kind
Too much overprice pub grub
The waitstaff is nice, but I totally agree with the other reviews that say the manager is horrible
I have been there twice, and both times he humiliated a waitress in front of my table and then proceeded to be overly nice (read: annoying) to our party
I will not be going back here again
Wow
My boyfriend wants to go to this place with a lot of beer
So I go, thinking it was going to be just another swill hall
So we get there, and its like, just beautiful
Nice and clean, attentive service and they make cosmopolitans the best
There was a lot of beer on tap, and my boyfriend had to try them all, like 30 of them, but the food was excellent too
I had a really great shrimp salad and we shared the best burger
Everything was pretty good
A great restaurant I highly recommend
These reviews are right on the money! This place has gone downhill in a short amount of time
If you do want a hard-to-find brew, stick to the basics (the beer) and skip the food
The staff (namely the manager) needs to chill out and work the books, not the customers
and not much else
It's also on York, so factor in cab fare
The staff is really very nice to everyone and aims to please
I did not see David Copperfield when I was there
Does no one else remember this guy?
I started coming here and it was great
Food overpriced and not great, beer overpriced not a special selection, but decent
What made it was the laid back atmoshphere of most of the staff and bartenders
The owners have fired all those people and now the place is just not worth the overpricedness
Sad
it was one of the least pretentious places on the East Side
The chicken ceasar is great though
Beautiful Ambiance, large, warm and cozy
French Bistro like with a vast marble bar
Huge row of imported and domestic craft beers on tap, including quite a few rareties
The bar service we received while awaiting a table was impeccable, severals samples of beer were generously proferred prior to our making a selection
Quality was spot on: exactly the right temperature, and to be sure they must clean their lines frequently
Fajitas were out of this world, and the fish chips were sublime
Best pub food I have ever tasted
Nice tunes emitting from the sound system, soft lights, great food and drinks combined with speedy, thoughtful service and fair prices
A great place for family and friends
I went to David Copperfields a few years ago and even though the food was pretty flavorless and overpriced, the beer selection made it worthwhile
I was there twice in the last week and both times, the beer was warm and flat, and on the second trip when I finally worked up the nerve to complain, I later overheard the owner complaining about me
There are plenty of perfectly decent pubs on the upper east side/yorkville

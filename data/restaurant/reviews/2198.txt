The atmosphere is one of a kind with rows of pipes covering the ceiling, and vintage photographs of showgirls, and posters
It's a macho atmosphere, but still very inviting
And don't miss the bar: polished wood, vintage cash register, a wide variety of single malt Scotches and hard-boiled eggs to hold you over until dinner
Oldest steakhouse in Manhattan
Great old NY atmosphere
Have to see it
Try the chopped steak
Great old style hearty steakhouse
Perfect steaks along with the best condiments
Diligent service with no rush policies
Great Friday night hangout
First hangout at the bar, then have dinner, and end with satisfying dessert/cordial
The steaks at are simply great
Keens has surpassed every steakhouse in the city - and I know them all! In addition, it has lamb cops to make you weep and - surprisingly - a Dover Sole just as good as Wilton's in London, England
And the zillions of pipes are something else!
I don't normally frequent steakhouses, but when I was taken to Keens I was surprised to discover not only succulent, sizzling steaks, but the most delicious lobster - barring none - that I have ever eaten
The oysters on the half shell that I ordered as an appetizer were also excellent
All this came with attentive and polite service in spite of walking in to a bustling room with no reservation
As a women, I felt very comfortable among the mostly male crowd
When you first walk in, it's crowded, dark and pretty run down
But the food is pretty fresh and creative
The price is also average for a diner
I enjoyed what I got, and that's what counts
My friends liked what they got also
It was crowded when I went around 6PM and but once you ordered your food, it was prompt and the service paid attention
The decor is a little rundown and while we were in the restaurant a loud clanging noise persisted for several minutes (pipes?)
I didn't think dinner was all that cheap
We ordered 2 cheeseburgers with fries and 2 cokes
The bill came to $35
00 including tax
The cheeseburger was good but not sure it's worth that much
My family and I just happened upon this restaurant when we were looking for a place to eat after the auto show
It's walking distance from Javits Center and we had a delicious lunch
The food was fresh, nicely presented and good portions
What really got me was the prices-v
inexpensive for the quality and considering how expensive it is to eat in Manhattan these days it was a treat!
My boyfriend and I were going to an off-broadway show in the area and a friend recommended Market cafe for pre-theater meal
Now I can't wait to back! Though not top decor, it has a hip vibe, cool music and the food is outstanding
We started with cocktails-a superb margarita (served in a brandy snifter!) and a yummy Apple Martini
We split a scallop appetizer that was de-lish
Next we had a steak frites and a salmon that were both first-rate
We finished w/chocolate cake and I almost fell off my chair when the waiter brought it over, it was the biggest piece of cake I've ever seen
I almost fell off my chair again, when the waiter brought the bill and it was under $60 for all of that! What a find, we'll definitely be back
The scallops and cod were delicious
They burnt the bruschetta
Most of our meal was really great, until the very, very end
It was a few minutes before Midnight, and there were three tables leftperhaps 10 to 15 people all together
All had paid their bills
We were all leaving in a matter of moments, when a waiter came up to each table and said We are waiting for you
All the customers were kind of stunned
We even joked to each other, wondering where the waiter wanted us to go with him
My table instantly wished we'd given less of a tip
Everyone walked out promptly into the cold, rainy night
They definitely lost 10-15 customers last night
This spot is perfect for pre-theatre, if you're looking to save some $$$ but want a great meal, and your theatre's in the lower 40's
(it would be a bit of a hike to the Neil Simon, for example
) Delicious skirt steak, but be sure to listen for the specials; they're often marvelous surprises at unbeatable prices
I had a DELICIOUS saddle of rabbit over mashed potatoes; I still remember how good it tasted
Cupcake Cafe down the street for a quick dessert!
the food here is spectacular but most of the waiters have serious attitude problems
Be prepared to wait a long time for a person to seat you while there are many tables free and you aren't allowed to seat yourself and the occassional terrible service
This place is a life-saver
Helpful and cheery service, tasty and fresh food, amazing amazing fries, and not to costly
They'll end up naming a booth for me, I go so often
Best place to eat near the Jarvits Center
Food was absolutely fantastic and the service is friendly and prompt
No matter how busy, your food always comes out on time and fresh
Recommend the Cod Cake and Smoke Chicken Salad w Endive
eureka! this place is nyc's hidden jewel!! Fantastic food and very well thought out wine list
Zagats,NY Times ,wake up, this place is a must for any serious food lover
and what a bargain!
One of the absolute best Eggs Benedict for Sunday Brunch that I have ever had
During the week the rest of the food is just as amazing with such reasonable prizes
It is my favorite restaurant in the area
It gets very busy at times so there might be a wait
Great food atmosphere with simple but charming decor
Also surprisingly inexpensive with generous portions
this is one of my favorite places to go in NYC
the food is always amazing and never fails to leave me dreaming about the next time
the rigatoni with chicken is bursting with flavor and the farfalle with sausage is always a winner
it's a great cozy and fun neighborhood joint so let's keep it a secret!!
No frill what so ever but a good place to grab beers in midtown
Semi smoker friendly on slow nights
Never eaten here
Good place to meet up before heading out on weekends and better for after work
I frequent Blaggard's on Tuesday nights, and it's always fun
At Blaggard's you can kick back and hang out
The bartender is very friendly and the drinks are resonably priced
Pool table upstairs
Good place to party low key
for you to tuck into
The food is fabulous bar fare, always tasty served up by your friendly barkeep who's on hand to keep the beer and the conversation flowing
Dont expect a late salad at the Avenue of the Americas store
The shelves of lettuce and spinach are cleared as early as 2:30
Too bad for you late eaters
Not to worry though, theres plenty of other place in the area to choose from
The entire staff was so helpful when I needed a platter made up in a hurry
I will definitely be back!
Shala by far is one of the best lunch joints in the neighborhood
They make FANTASTIC from-scratch veggie burgers, fresh roasted chicken daily and have HH bagels

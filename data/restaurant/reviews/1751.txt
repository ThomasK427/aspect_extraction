I would highly recommend visiting this establishment
You will not be disappointed!
Red Cat has a charming, rustic decor with an urbane menu
The appetizers were creative and interesting - the lobster with potato chips was a particularly fun and tasty combination of haute food with junk food - and the extensive wine list is stocked with solid, reasonably priced bottles
The entrees we tried (skate, trout, liver, and duck) were well-executed, but not terribly inventive as far as flavor combinations went
Service is friendly and attentive without being overbearing
Plus, we stopped by on a Saturday evening without a reservation, and were able to get seats right away
It's nice to have a place where you can go and count on being seated quickly, getting good service, and getting a satisfying - though not necessarily revelatory - meal
Wow - the food was great
Some menu items that you don't see in most restaurants - very creative chefs
Appetizers were unique, fish entrees were quite good
Small place with laid-back vibe
Good service
just not impressed with either the service or the food so was startled to read the editor's review above
the whole of my group thought that while the place is adequate in terms of style and abience, it has little to recommend it from a food or service p

would not make the same mistake twice
I'm sorry -- I just don't get the glowing reviews here
It's not that the food was bad -- it's just that some of it was mediocre at best
As far as the atmosphere -- nice for the person facing into the restuarant, but really bad for the person facing the unattractive wall
Dinner came to over $70 -- not bad for a great meal -- but this just didn't hit the mark
Appetizer (rabbit) was good, but main course (trout) was dried out and tasteless
Dessert (sundae) was completely average
However, the service was very nice and attentive
Red Cat is an experience that anyone, whether you're a foodie or not, should experience at some point
Quaint decor, fantastic staff (that bent over backwards for us), delicious cocktails and of course, the food, all contribute to a fantastic dining experience
I highly recommend the lobster perogies as a starter, as well as the pork tenderloin entree
Their champagne cocktails are also quite wonderful
If I had to sum up this place: it's ideal for a special night out
Noise levels are not low, but the atmosphere is buzzing with an energy and spirit that will make you want to stick around for a little while and soak it up
Met a friend for dinner last night and was pleasantly suprized with EVERYTHING that we ordered
The appitizers, entrees, sides and desserts where all phenomenal
The waitress and staff where knowledgable, friendly and effiecient
There is nothing better than a fabulous dining experience
would recommend!!
The Red Cat is a great neighborhood place
The atmosphere is very nice, but not stuffy
The service has always been excellent
The menu doesn't change all that often, but the food is excellent
A good range of dishes from seafood like skate and salmon to steak and pork tenderloin
They also have a great wine selection and a nice bar to eat or drink at
Just moved to NY and have been hopping around areas and eating out lots - this place is definately my fav so far
Great neighbourhood place, excellent food, great service and attention to details as well as knowledge of wine
Low key yet impressive atmosphere - all in all a great package
I live close by adn will definately be back on aregular basis
The restaurant was amazing
It was casual with a great ambience
Everything we ordered was wonderful
Our group had the pork chop, steak and duck
The wine list was wonderful
The location is hard to get to but I will be back when I am in NY again
Our waitress was rather unattentive
She also seemed a bit annoyed when we asked for a few minutes when we first sat down before actually ordering
However, the wine she picked for us and the food we ordered certainly made up for this initial annoyance
I had the wild striped bass and it was cooked to perfection
The skin remained crisp, while the meat maintained its succulence
Excellent!
I was taken to the Red Cat for my birthday, pre-theater and I can't put into words just how quaint and wonderful this evening was
The decor reminds me of something you would stumble across while travelling the french countryside
All the staff, hostess, bartender was very attentive, however the waitstaff could have slightly reduced the attitude
Regardless, they provided everything we needed quickly
The highlight of the food was definitely the appetizers and dessert
The entrees were excellent, but missing that finishing touch
Living in the city I'm always trying something new, but I would definitely come back to pet this cat
Way out in Chelsea, Red Cat is worth the trip
Given the owners' past project, you could guess that this restaurant would be a success, but it is a perfect mix of chic and home-y
The dining room is lovely
The bar area is small, but they do a great job of seating promptly
And the specialty drinks are delicious if you have to wait
I had the peach and pancetta risotto first - who would have guessed that those two ingredients could be so delicious?!
Delightful place - great atmosphere! Wonderful service
Would definitely go again
Plus - Very Romantic!
Being from Chelsea I've always wanted to try this place
I'm only sorry I didn't go sooner
The service was pleasant
The food was good, maybe even very good
We were seated right away
But don't get the parmigiana fries - they were the only downer
Everything else from the wine suggestion to the dessert was delicious
lively restaurant - fun place, the atmosphere is perfect for a great casual meal
we had a reservation and were seated right away
waitress was nice, without being pushy
the food was very good (not great but certainly not disappointing)
the only thing i was disappointed with was the foie-gras appetizer, which couldn't really compare with its counterpart in other restaurants
the light tempura of green beans was the best part of the meal! desserts were also very good, particularly the chocolate cake
definitely worth the trip!
Host was great, very friendly and accommodating
Our server started out miserable
It took about an hour before we saw her stop sneering
Never went out of her way for us, but eventually someone friendlier came by to finish the job
Food was OK, but Ive definitely had much better
Appetizers we had were creative and tasty, which increased expectations for the main course
My pork chop was a bit too fatty and not as succulent as I had hoped
The salmon was quite dry and lacked oomph
The peanut butter mousse desert was enjoyable
Good wine list with many quality wines at a wide range of prices
Dcor was rather uninspired, but clean and had enough space, but still a little too close to other tables for my liking
I wouldnt wish one of the tables in the crowded bar area on anyone, though

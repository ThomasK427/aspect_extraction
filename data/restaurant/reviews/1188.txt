They update the menu each week depending on seasonal ingredients and hot finds
You cannot be disappointed
There is something for everyone, and the most delicious homemade cookies
The space is cool, earthy, and hip
The staff is so friendly and really believe in their menu
Great wine list and drink specials
Would go there every week if my schedule would allow
Their infamous sticky toffee pudding tasted like old fruitcake soaked in jarred toffee sauce
It didn't come with bananas or vanilla gelato like the menu says
just a handful of berries and creme fraiche
It's rare for me to try a dessert I don't like in NY, but this rates as one of the worst
And to top it off, this bland concoction was overpriced at $9
Definitely skip this overrated dessert
The atmosphere, however, is nice, mellow and loungy and it's located on a calm block, away from the loud LES scene
Decent service also
Little Giant was a warm and almost cozy oasis on a rainy Friday night recently
We were greeted warmly and seated immediately
The service fell just short of good, drifting off as the evening waned
But our food was terrific
The nosh platter was generous and delicious, and my scallops with brown butter sauce and a minty pea puree was really one of the best entrees I've had in a long time
Desserts were lovely too, including a selection of just-baked cookies
Tighten up the service a little and this place would be killer
The food here is great -- it's imaginative, high-end cuisine at mid-level prices
The spot is tiny, though, and this might impact your comfort, depending on where you are seated
A destination restaurant on the Lower East Side
I really only have one thing to say, cutesy little names and a kitschy decor do not a great restaurant make
For example, it's one thing to adapt and modernize classic recipes, it is another thing entirely to appropriate a name of a true classic and attach it to a dish that has nothing in common with its namesake
Their Lower East SIde Reuben has no corned beef, no swiss, no sauerkraut, and NO RUSSIAN DRESSING! Instead one's sandwich sensibilities are accosted by a few slices of sickly sweet braised pork that's more fat than meat, syrupy red cabbage, and some salty italian cheese
Furthermore considering the prices you pay, you'd expect to leave at least somewhat satisfied instead of having to stop next door for a very tasty pickle
Go elsewhere for brunch
Having read numerous reviews we were very excited to try Little Giant
As is typical with the advance hype, the experience did not hold a candle
The service was very average, the menu extremely limited (especially if you do not want a heavy meal)
More disconcerting was the bill; $200 for two with wine pre-tip!?! Little Giant has west village/tribeca/midtown prices but unless the food or ambience improve, why make the trip when you have so many better options that offer the whole package for the same price?
Little giant has little to be desired, little professionalism and giant attitude
There are many finer experiences than this amateur little place
From people who dine all over NYC, we recommend you avoid this giant disappointment
I went to Little Giant for brunch with some friends
It was freezing outside and we found the space cozy and the staff friendly
The menu was varied if you're not a vegetarian
The food was good but the portions were tiny which is a bit cheap on their part considering the price
The Brunch Special didn't include a drink--that cost an extra $8 or so
I wouldn't want to be there when it was too crowded--I'm patient but not *that* patient
It took a long time for the food to come to the table
There are places just as quaint with better food in the neighborhood
I'm always on the search for the perfect, fun restaurant
You know, the one with an intimate atmosphere in a cool neighborhood with a hip clientele, fun waiters, festive cocktails, yummy food, and chic owners
And yippee! I found it all at Little Giant
Our group of 5 was seated promptly, the drinks and wine came as fast as we could consume them, the food was delicious, and best of all, our waiter was loose and quirky fun
The very lovely owner described him as pistachio ice cream, either you love it or hate it
We loved it
One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long long time!
Waited for an hour to get our food and there were only 2 other people in the joint
When the food arrived it was cold and over cooked
All the waiter kept saying was sorry we're out of that
I was expecting great things but they failed
Hope they get on the stick or they won't last long
Many better places in LES so no matter what we won't go back
Sorry guys you only get one shot
We were seated promptly on a Friday night at 7:30 with reservations
Service was prompt, attentive, and they even offered us more of that delicious bread
I had the Swine of the Week which consisted of tender pulled pork butt atop a sweet biscuit and paired with cabbage slaw
Simply delightful
We also shared the savory Cavatelli Pesto as an appetizer
The portion was just right for 2! I was totally at ease in this LES joint
comfy, intimate ambience
great experience!
Great food, fast and friendly service, Good wine selection
Quiet and clean
I can honestly say that my dinner at Little Giant was one of the best I've had in more than 10 years of living in NYC
The ambiance is welcoming but still hip
The service was spot-on
attentive without being in my face all the time
And the food, well the food was perfect! I went with 2 friends and tried all the dishes they ordered as well as my own and each was better than the last
I can't recommend it highly enough for dinner with your sweetie or your friends
The service was so friendly and wonderful- it felt like I was eating with friends
They were totally accomodating, we were three initially and halfway through our meal a couple more friends arrived and they were seated and fed
I wasn't even hungry when we arrived but couldn't stop eating because everything tasted so good
Deviled eggs, sirloin platter, scallops, tasty drinks, all the desserts- the apple toffee concoction- so good! We've all been talking about the great dining experience for the past 3 days
Everything my friend and I tasted here last night was nearly perfect
We tried 2 kinds of oysters, the Reuben Salad, Sausage Onions, and lamb chops
Seasoning, doneness, portions, presentation were all without any complaints
I normally despise sitting right next to strangers in rowes of two-tops, but here, somehow, the smallness of the space did not distract from the gastronomic bliss
Great service and fair prices too
After waiting 15 minutes on a saturday night, I was about to give up, when miracles of miracles I got a seemingly coveted corner table at this gem of a restaurant
The service was attentive and accessable
And the food, amazing
You can not go and not order 3 courses, the appetizers are inventive, fun and fresh
The entrees we had were all good to great
The swine of the week is about the best thing I have had this year and the steak sandwich were standouts
And then Whoopie Pies!!! Place is just too much fun and seems to reflect the (hot) chef's attitude and talents
Little Giant is everything I ask for in a resturant andmore
This is going to be a go to place for us
Got a reservation at the last minute on a Friday night
I guess that should have been the tip-off
We'd been here once before for appetizers and dessert which were both quite good
Everything sounded delicious and we were cheerily seated by the hosted in the corner table (she even remembered us from our last visit more than a month ago)
That's where the fun ended
The drinks took nearly 20 minutes after the order
Appetizers came up just after the drinks

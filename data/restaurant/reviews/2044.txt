They messed up on 2 items in the order
$4 of a $84 dollar check
They forgot to bring one and messed up the other
The waitress argued with me, then scoffed at me
The check arrived with the items still on the menu
I asked to see the manager
She refused, then stood over me waiting me to pay the bill
I refused and asked again to speak to the manager
When the manager arrived I explained the situation
Honestly $4 on a $84 check (jalopeno's and pico de gallo)
He said I had to pay for what I ordered
Now, yes I ordered both items, but both were mistakes
I will never go back
I felt insulted and ripped off
If I had ordered a steak and got chips and salsa they would, I guess, charge me for the steak?  Do not go!
I used to enjoy cominng here - but it seems this place has really gone down hill - fast
The only saving grace was that the food was cheap fast the servers were decent - meaning - they looked clean reliable
Now - your lucky if your server doesnt look like they just came here in an inner tube - sorry - but its pretty bad when they have to get the bus boy to translate Can I have a napkin? Also - I really dont think you should pay extra for chipolte sauce when you simply ask for it on the side!!! ALSO - I tried the 3rd Ave location - it was actually WORSE than the 7th Ave loca
Good food, great atmosphere, awesome bartenders, and the best margaritas this former Texan's ever had
We had a fairly dismal experience dining here this evening
The music was too loud, the DJ was constantly and repeatedly announcing names and advertisements for the restaurant, and we had to seek out the host ourselves
As for the food, the fajitas tasted as though they had been roasting on a grill that hadn't been cleaned for six months, and the tacos were grossly misrepresented (much larger than I were told) and encased in a stale corn shell
We won't be returning
$13 for a slushie machine margarita in a souvenir glass? I would have never ordered it if the price was on the menu
We also weren't given the option of ordering one in a regular glass
Bad food, inadequate service, smells like a tourist trap to me
Don't get caught in it
I have gone to Caliente many times and its alot of fun
the food is great and the drinks rock!If you want something great I recomend their checker fuel and if you are hungry anything from the specials menu will make your day
You should be able to tell from the moment you see it but this is no more than a tourist trap
The place has a great location outdoors during warm days but that is it
You'll have to wait for a seat and will be greeted with bland, overpriced food
As this place ages it gets worse
Bland food, arroganrt waiters
Thank god there are far better Mexican restaurants in the hood
I went to eat at this place because my cousin said it was good
But it was a complete rip off
The food is awful and the chips are stale and salty!  The drinks cost $13 and thats because you get to keep the souvenir glasses
which are sooo not worth it
I highly recommend that you NEVER eat here
We were charged extra for the parmesan cheese!
Margaritas were great, the food was good
It was not bad, it was average
Places to hang out add get great Mexican food without the grease!! Strong drinks
Outdoor seating
When you want some fun food and drinks w/out attitude look beyond the cheesy taxi and go!!
i went to caliente cab co because their margaritas got such great reviews
from the margaritas to the food, it was by far the worst mexican restaurant in new york
the margaritas cost $13 each and had no tequila and no taste
the food was terrible
total waste of money
I always bring my out of town guests here for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning and to this day they all continue to rave about the place
Three free frozen margaritas and delectible Mexican food
You can't go wrong especially on a gorgeous summer morning when you can sit outside in thier patio section and people watch
I once sat right next to Bjork
Too bad some people confuse this location with then one on Waverly
Completely different atmosphere
I have been to this restaurant many times and I have always enjoyed the food here
The drinks are bit expensive but hey who goes to a restaurants for drinks
You can go to a bar later on
Another good thing about this place is you can sit outside in the sumer time (ofcourse)
Thats always nice
Overall I would recommend this place at least once
I liked the feel of the place overall, but the drinks were super expensive and the bartenders barely spoke english and had no concept of buybacks
As a transplanted Texan, I once got suckered into going to this miserable excuse for a Tex-Mex restaurant
The margaritas taste like windex and it is probably the worst food i have eaten in 3+ years of living in Manhattan
PLEASE, save yourself from a wasted evening and skip it
I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and the frozen margaritas were exceptional
The service was excellent and we were treated to a somewhat special event when the former (and future?) Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his gal Judi Nathan happened to be walking by
It was all in all a terrific dining experience
The food was, at best somewhat average, but the entire experience was delightful
I have been here twice and they were both great
The first time was with friends, we were seated promptly and the waitress was great
The second time was on a date, again we were seated promptly and out waiter was wonderful
Drinks were delicious, try Long Island Ice Tea
Food wasn't good, or authentic
It is nice to sit outside on a sunny day and watch people go by though
I went to this place and though it's been around for awhile, it continues to impress me
I go out a lot in NYC and it's one of the few places I go to where the crowd is overall very good looking
The music is a good mix of hip hop and dance
Only thing about this place is that it is a bit small but it's perfect for smaller parties
Halo was a pleasant surprise
After reading the review in another nightlife publication, I was downright scared
It said, you'd be lucky to get in and you'll feel uncomfortable if you're not a size two
I don't disagree with these sentiments (we had to wait until our group was equal in the ratio of guys to girls) but the atmosphere was very pleasing to the eye and ear
Good music and a really luxurious yet homey setting punctuated by the carpeted floors lent itself to an upscale yet relaxed evening
And, you can dance if you want to but with the carpet, you might feel as though you are in your basement playroom making up a dance with your best pals
In Short The interior time-warps diners back to the days when the West Village was known as "Little Spain" with matador and flamenco dancer portraits, comfy booths, Tiffany-style lamps and bustling old-time servers
Longstanding fans line the bar while young newcomers, weary of waits at packed, trendy neighbors, spill into the comfortable dark-paneled dining room
In addition to the famous paellas, patrons favor piquillo peppers, garlic-doused mussels, two types of bacalao and various veal preparations
Certainly one of the best Spanish places i've been
Being a Good Food lover, I can say that this place is a definite return type of restaurant
From the appetizers to the main course and through dessert, I couldn not have enjoyed it more
Very fresh and delicious seafood
For appetizers we had mussels (mejillones al ajillo), fried calamaries, crab meat stuffed mushrooms, spanish sausage
and one was better than the other one
The Paella definitely had high quality ingredients and the Green Sauce seafood main dish was also fresh and tasty
Great staff
Honest, nice and helpful
But just like the other reviewers said

50 for a bottle of sparkling pellegrino and $8
75 for a bowl of minestrone soup
It was pretty pricey, and I felt like I was looked down upon for being young when I'm paying the same amount of money as everyone else
Very expensive, excellent food, if you can afford it, I would go, but if you're budget is tight try somewhere else
There was no wait and it is in a good location
In Short  With half the space devoted to the open kitchen, this small restaurant has only five tables and specializes in takeout and delivery
The owner and staff put their attention into the food: shawarmas, beef and chicken kebabs, chicken livers, falafel, hummus and other delicacies are available in a pita or on a platter
The platter costs more but comes with a scattering of salads, dips and relishes, making for a sizeable meal
first time, I dealt with it, second time, I had to tell them twice what I wanted and they still got it wrong
Called to complain and the response was well, we didn't charge you for the falafel sandwich we shorted you
I'll give them a 3rd try, because their food is amazing, but they really need to pay attention to their customers
Delicious Middle Eastern food at cheap prices
Could come right out of Tel Aviv
Ezra Cohen is a friendly host
I've had lots of falafels in this city and the middle east as well
Up until I went to this place, my favorite falafel was Sam's falafel (he had a cart down near the WTC)
I think I can say now that Azuri is by far the best falafel I've ever had
Yeah, the guy can be a little rough around the edges but that's just part of the experience
The falafel were perfectly crispy and flavorful
The other ingredients were EXTREMELY fresh and delicous
I highly recomend this place to any falafel lover
You want be disappointed
The small falafel plate is one of the best things I've ever eaten in New York City
Don't expect a leisurely meal, though
This place is tiny
EXTREMELY tiny
The food is worth the sometimes prickly owner and crowd
The last review is correct- the hummus was amazing! The $6 small falafel plate is not at all small and a great bargain
It comes with falafel, hummus, babbaganoush, several vegetable salads, pickles and bread
The atmosphere is cozy, although I imagine it could get pretty crowded as there are only four little tables
The owner was warm and genial, joking around with everyone
Found this place on Zagat's after searching for a restaurant under $15 with a high rating in the West 50's
I went early, around 11:30am, for lunch b/c I hate crowds, especially in midtown
The place was small and simple, but I never cared about service or decor
I had the large falafel plate
The falafels were ok (only 3) but the 8 side salads were super
I have never had such delicious hummus, even in Israel
Miriam makes excellent pita bread that she even sells in bulk
Overall worth the schlepp
First, Mr
Cohen (the owner) is one of the nicest and warm restaurant owners I have ever met
I came with my brother last night (he has been begging to drag me all the way there for ages)
and Mr
Cohen welcomed us with open arms
The food is amazing! Even though it is a hike it is definitely worth it!!! I can't wait to go back! Thanks Mr
Cohen!!!
I have never in my life wrote a review about anything, but after last night's DISGUSTING experience at Old San Juan, I can't keep quiet
I read so many good reviews about this restaurant, so it seemed like a great place to try for our friend's birthday
Forget the service (which was horrible) and forget the food (which made me and everyone in my party sick) as I was sitting at the table, I felt something walk across my foot
I looked down to see the biggest cockroach walking underneath our table
I understand that many NYC restaurants have them, but I'm sorry - out in the open where people are dining??? That is just VIAL DISGUSTING! I will never go back there again, nor will anyone I ate with nor should anyone else
I come to this restaurant often
No where can you match both the service and the food
Portions are large, food is amazing
The churrasco is tender and delicious
And no where else in the NYC area can I find mofongo de camarones done so well
I cannot recommed this place more!
went to old san juan on a friday night
the atmosphere is not romantic as it suggests, the service is average, the food sucked
we did get a lot of food, but the food was not good
arroz y pollo (chicken and rice) - bone chicken, not cooked fully, no flavor in rice
chicken and garlic sauce - fried chicken in butter sauce
the only item that was some what decent was black beans
not recommended
After reading some great reviews for this restaurant I was excited to try this place
I went with a friend on a weekend early afternoon
We waited for our food as many of the other tables around us were served, most of which came in after we did
When we asked the waiter what the holdup was, he told us it would be out in just a few more minutes
After waiting another 30 minutes, we got our check and left hungary
Total time waiting for our food over one hour
I was shocked to have gotten no apology from the management, and to top it off were charged for the drinks we had while patiently waiting for food that never arrived
If you want to go spend an hour and never get served go to this place
This is where Puerto Rican co-workers took me for lunch
and what a place! The place looks old and well-worn, but in a good way
The service is somewhat slow, but that feels sort of authentic also? And the food
wow
I really recommend the chicken and rice
My absolute favorite dish
I have gone there once and loved it, I came back with my family and we never stop going
It is the best placed to eat spanish food, the service and friendly atmoshere is the best
My daughter who's nine loves to eat there all the time? the tamales are delicious as well as for the mofongo, pefecto?
Finding this gem was lucky
It's hard to find good Puerto Rican food that's not from a cuchifrito, or some small mom and pop shop
Harder still is to find a Mofongo that's not dry
Old San Juan gives me the delicious Puerto Rican food made just as I was in the island
Add to the fact that the restaurant is a restaurant with impeccable service
1/2 the menu is Argentinian and they have a wonderful selection there too
Service is impeccable as the waiter held out my chair for me and was on top of our every need
I cannot recommend this place enough
OMG! The food is delicious
The Mofongo is excellent not to mention the fresh Sangria! I haven't had a meal that I did not like!
We went with some friends not sure what to expect given the rating on city search
The rating doesn't do it justice
The food is fantastic and is the kind of place where if its not on the menu - they will make it for you
The wine selection is superb as well
I love this place
The food is healthy and priced reasonably
What more can you ask for a restaraunt that you can rely on for everyday dinner
Not the most tasty dinner but if you have a palate for healthy food it's a great choice
This place is a hole in the wall

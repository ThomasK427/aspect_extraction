The place is really authentic
Even most of the people sitting in the dining room seem European
The service was pretty pleasant
Laid back, but not in a negligent way
I had the steak frites, which, though good, wasn't mind-blowing
Overall, I enjoyed it, but it could improve
Country French cuisine, like you'd find on a typical sidewalk cafe in a Southern French Atlantic Seaport town
Excellent Moules Frites, excellent couscous, excellent steak, and a good choice of wine and cocktails
It's a fun place to go for a casual dinner, and truly a great deal
The Frenchie feel is both exciting and intoxicating
Good afforable food - and wonderful staff
I love this place
It's so nice in the summer when they open up the doors to overlook the park
it's very social and friendly and the food is a bargain
someone said this place must be for locals
well maybe it is
They are always so sweet to us because we go there so much
The decor is just aborable too! I always bring my guests to flea market when they visit the city
OH! And the bread is so perfectly yeasty and crusty! Yum!
The Scene This neighborhood kitchen in the East Village, though pleasantly cozy, is scarcely big enough to hold four tables
The few diners-in are jostled by the constant flow of takeout customers
Service is counter-only, but the turnaround is remarkably quick, given the tiny staff and kitchen
The Food The inexpensive menu features reliable versions of dishes like pad thai and papaya salad; the latter is tart and faintly spicy, with crunchy strips of green papaya in a limey dressing
The pad thai has a nutty, mild flavor and can be ordered with chicken, shrimp, crab, lobster or tofu, or combinations thereof
The tom kha soup has a coconut-milk base, but not a heavy one, and is redolent of lemongrass and laden with succulent mushrooms and tofu
Red coconut curry is mildly spicy and harbors chunks of cauliflower and tasty mock duck
This is a travesty to Thai cuisine
I don't care how cheap it is; it's really god awful food
I've lived in Thailand
Any self-respecting Thai person would disown this!
The food was dry and not very tasty
I would not reccomend this at all and I have tasted thai food all over the world
This is probably the cheapest Thai food that I've had in the city
You cannot get great-tasting Thai food at this price anywhere else
The restaurant is really tiny, however, it is a great place for a date or intimate dinner
Kai Kai was recommended to me by a friend and I was not dissappointed
Everything I tried was fresh and tasty
Most of their seating is for couples, so it is a great place to take a date before heading off to see a show
my vegetable pad Thai came with two vegetables: soy bean sprouts and a few pieces of scallion
the noodles weren't even well-seasoned
Kai Kai's other dishes may be better than their pad Thai, but I can't say that I'll rush back to find out
I had tapioca with coconut milk for a dollar and I've got addicted to it
Also rice and spicy curry for $ 4
50 and a can of soda for lunch
Yummy!
tiny place with only 3 tables and no restroom, but the lady working there said the guys next door at Grey Dog's would let us use theirs
Chicken Pad Thai is a must try
and pay the 50 cents for extra peanut sauce!
Discovered this little Thai Bistro late one Friday nite
It's not the best Thai food I've ever had, but great if you are looking for a cheap cheerful bite in the area
The place is small (10 tables), atmosphere is warm cozy, service is friendly and food is good value for money
Delicious steamed dumplings
Excellent pad thai
Fast service
Reasonable prices
What more can you ask for?
Reasonable, delicious food served quickly - how can you go wrong!
Cannot believe the 10 ratings above
Ordered take out from Kai Kai last night and can confidently say it was my worst dining experience in NY to date
They said food would be with us in 15 mins
four times
When it finally arrived over an hour later the green curry was stringy chicken with actually NO sauce at all (made the rice a bit redundant without sauce to absorb) and the beef was tough, dry and totally lacking the promised chilli basil topping
Rude on the phone clearly hopeless in kitchen
It's hard to ruin a green curry
not, it seems, for Kai Kai
In Short No other establishment has better capitalized on the changing demographic of the East Village than Lucky Cheng's
When the restaurant first opened in the early 1990s, who could've have guessed that singing drag queens serving Chinese food would become a big-ticket lure for bachelorette and office parties? And yet, stretch limos full of tipsy accountants and brides-to-be line up for campy decor, belted karaoke and catty jokes about menu items like crackling duck and the pupu platter
We just went to Lucky Chengs on Sat evening
We had resorvations for 7pm which when we arrived only a hand full of tables were taken, but that didn't last
I think we arrived just at the right time
We had and Amazing time
The bachelorette lap dances were so great they were really comical our bachelorette was like hell no because they were very up close and personal if you know what I mean
The food was good but it all was a little to much money
We had a good time
Although the big hard crazy drag queen did turn man on me for minute and yelled at me because I was tring to take a picture of my friend up on stage which we tip $30 so she could get up there for part of the show
But all in all it was fun
I brought my brother there for his birthday, needless to say all the guys in our party were gaga'd over the queens, and they were beautiful The food was good, the decor great and I loved the smoke-free atmosphere in the main restaurant
Great not having to smell like a cigarette for once
The entertainment is not for th weak-hearted, so if you are prudish, not a good spot, but if you like getting drunk, then you might be able to stomach it
Addendum: I brought my friend here for her bachelorette party
it was amazing, everything went spectacularly and the bowl drinks are a good tasting value!
Brought my mom for her 60th birthday and could not have had more fun
The performers are professional dancers and comedians and had her in stitches
They even got her up on stage for a lap dancing contest which she won
Food fabulous as are the drinks and the girls
Can't wait to go back!!!
Came here with friends and had a wonderful time! Our waitress Tora was beautiful and made everything sound so delicious and sensual that we had a hard time deciding what to order! The menu is a 3 course dinner for $32 with some dishes costing a few extra dollars
Drinks are strong and can come in a large scorpion bowl for you to share
Went to see the all male revue later upstairs and while some were cute, most were flabby
Definitely not Chippendales! All in all, this place is an adult playground and I highly recommend it for your bachelorette party!  Biggest con is that the guy bringing the food to our table was extremely rude
He said something gruff in Spanish and threw the plates down unapologetically
We went here last night for a bachelorette party
It was awful from start to finish
Very unorganized! We thought we had reservations for dinner before the show, but no, we were only signed up for the male revue
After reading the reviews I'm glad we went to dinner afterwards! The male revue was a joke
The men were cheesy, flabby and unattractive
The MC was cursing at our crowd and telling us how lame we were
Then the strippers would walk around and gyrate on you for tips
If they were even remotely cute, it would've made it better! I'd rather have seen the drag queen show than pay $20 for this!
Never had such a bad time, way too pricey, crappy service, too loud for a restaurant

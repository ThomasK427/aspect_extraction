I had seen this restaurant on The Food Channel
I lived nearby, but had never eaten here
I took my mother here for Mother's Day
I was very excited about their brunch, having seen it on Rachel Ray's show
The staff here is very good
Our reservations were intact, and we were seated the minute we walked in
The place was packed, but it didn't effect our service or getting our food/drinks promptly
The portions are not huge, but they do include an alcoholic beverage or fresh juice, so that made up for it
I highly recommend the eggs benedict or the fresh seared tuna salad
This would be a nice place to go after the theatre for a drink!
we celebrated our friend's engagement here, great spot for a small group of 12
brunch menu had nice variety to choose from, miniblueberrrymuffins better than some bakeries, included in their price mimosa/bloody mary's were nice
but svc SUCKED big time
we had 2 persons serving us
they messed up our orders, the eggs came out cold, the chicken sandwich fell apart, forget it if you want water refills
they were only attentative to see if we wanted any more bar drinks
me big mouth complained
anyway, nice place for brunch for selection under $20 meals desserts were great (3 flavors for creme brulee!!), funky restrooms
but sorry can't tip well for poor svc
My husband and I enjoy Sangria
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise
We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier
10 minutes later our drinks arrive and were not what we asked for
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave
When we asked for the check TO OUR SURPRISE the check was $40!!! WE were charged for two glasses of sangria and 4 shots
Needless to say we will never return
We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49
The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show
Fast service
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic
Went to Thalia on 2/4, our group was 2 couples
Beautiful space and we were seated immediately
Tables a bit close together, but did not have difficulty hearing each other
Smaller menu, but everyone found something they liked
I had a salad (very good, nice portion) and the duck - which was FANTASTIC, some of the best I've had
Overall, I recommend Thalia as a nice place to go for dinner or a quiet drink after
Tuna app was too small, but tasty
Mussels were plentiful, but sandy
Lamb was also plentiful, but not great- rissoto was gorgeous but not tasty
The Pumkin Scallops were great, and the kale was perfect
Sorbets were too strong and upside down pineapple cake was yummy
SO, what does this all mean
It means that if my date and I were one person, the meal would have been PERFECT
Too bad the perfect meal was my appetizer, my entree and her dessert
Restaurant week got us in the door, the normal prices will keep us out- but tourists and hipsters will keep them afloat
Cool, hip and spacious Thalia is, but a great spot it isn't
Thank you Avi for taking care of my family/dad's b/day
The brunch menu was excellent - great choices, my kids loved the blueberry mini muffins! The chicken crabcake sandwiches were delish
Lobster eggs eggs benedict were also good
We finally found a nice place with good food for brunch - so many others disappoint! Tho $15 for my kids shared butter pasta was a bit pricey
SUM IT: you have to try this place for brunch, can't speak for dinner
free parking is not bad if you get in early enough to walk around before your brunch
A friend of mine suggested Thalia because of its location to the theater of the show we were seeing that night and we were pleasantly surprised
The restaurant is beautiful and the atmosphere was truly New York
The host was gracious and we were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating waitress
Although she was obviously busy, she was helpful in describing certain items on the menu and suggested a duck dish that was out of this world
She even suggested a wine to accompany the duck and it was perfect
My husband had a scallop dish that was also excellent
The staff seemed friendly to customers and well as each other and we were very impressed with how well everyone seemed to work together, even in such a busy atmosphere
I would recommend Thalia to anyone, it was wonderful and set us in great mood to see our show
I went here on my boyfriend's birthday
The decor is relaxed and soothing
The dishies were a bit scanty but delicious
Good for dinner date
Great location
The service has always been mediocre
The hamburgers were once really good, the fries once delicious with little bits of crisp tasty herbs covering them
We looked forward to lunch
LOOK AGAIN! The service went Ker-Plop
From the moment we sat down, our waitress treated us as though we were an inconvenience
We waited 40 minutes for our burgers hoping someone would fill our water glass
Finally the burgers arrived
To our surprise, they were uniquely prepared (twice-baked)
Once on the grill for 15 minutes, then for another 25 minutes under a food warmer
They were unique! If you want a great burger at half the price go to The Corner Bistro in Greenwich Village
When in the theatre district, try McHales and be prepared for plenty of food
Better yet, get a great sandwich at Carve on 47th St and 8th Ave
Quiet impressed by the look and feel of the place when entered, seems to attract a wide and varied crowd which I like to see
We get seated and the whole experience changed, we had not sat down 5 minutes and the tablle staff moved our table to reset another table without a reference to us and did not put it back in place once completed
We proceeded to order a couple of drinks and our meal
We waited 35 minutes before any food was served, this was after complaining to the waitress who seemed to be overwhelmed dealing with the number of tables
Once the food was received one meal was cold and had to be sent back to be reheated as seemed that one meal had been left to the side while the other was being prepared
Overall an unsatisfactory experience from a service, food and cost perspective
I live in the area and eat at Thalia at least twice a week
The seafood is amazing and their brunch is excellent
I've probably had everything on the menu and have never been dissapointed
Oysters, mussels, shrimp cocktail (which are enormous) are great
Excellent wine list
A tremendous selection of scotch
I prefer to sit in the lounge area or at the bar, as the service is quicker and the space is more attractive
By far the best restaurant in the Theater District
i went there on a friday night and our server ignored us for 20 minutes
i also had to answer an important phone call and they simply left my plate at my empty seat for 15 minutes
not what i expected for $25 an entree
I was recently in there a couple of days ago, and I was glad to see this spot still busy

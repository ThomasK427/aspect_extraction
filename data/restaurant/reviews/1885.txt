You won't be disappointed
disappointed
pizza was far from what it used to be
The rest of the meal was okay,not great
Arturo's is a fave among locals
Tourists are often enticed by the if its crowded, it must be good mentality but they are overwhelmed by the transfixing atmosphere pulled straight from an early Fellini movie
The kitch paintings, dusty light fixtures and sunken-eyed staff give an Addams Family appeal
Free jazz too
Waiting for pizza means people watching
Matt Dillon, Mike Piazza, Ethan Hawke and other late-night pizza moshers are often seen galavanting about the bar area
Once the pizza does arrive, you are sent into culinary experience
Mid-westerners find the pizza too smoky, europeans want more cheese, but New Yorkers love its authentic coal-over flavor, crispy crust and savory sauce
(Arturo leaves chalk for people to confess their closed door antics)
Complaints are met with empty stares and a feeling that you'll be thrown out to the curb
GREAT PIZZA, NY style
and keep on reading lava10012 new yorker reviews we will keep the nyc spots to ourselves! making pies long before you came and long after you leave
This is the best local Italian place in NY
Meet neighborhood people, hang out, hear onf of the best jazz piano players in all of NY (Harry Whitiker) and meet the friendly staff
This is what a NY neighborhood bar is all about, which are sadly disappearing
Long Live Arturo's!
I was in love with their pizza but when i went back couple days ago, i was so sad to find their pizza soggy
I was very disappointed that i wanted to tell the waitress but since they are almost always so busy, i didn't get a chance to
The pizza here is really great, and I even love the cheesy atmosphere (no pun intended) in the dining room, but maybe it's the presence of the heavily packed bar but I always feel as though when I go I am being gawked at as something of an outsider
The waitresses always seem to be staring me down or something - aggressive in that weird way that's neither friendly or rude, just sort of curt and unpleasant
I always end up there and enjoy my meal, but I don't know, last time I went everyone was looking at my friends and I as though we had descretaed their sacred stomping ground with our presence
And we're just two normal guys!
It will be a sad day when I can not call Arturo's my neighborhood pizza place
My favorite pizza when you want to sit somewhere or when you want a pie
I still am partial to Joe's when you are looking for a slice to go
Arturo's is by far the most underated slice in the city
The nightly live music classes up the place, and the low prices keep me coming back for more
The service, while not terrible by any stretch, could use a little work
Went in with high hopes, left disappointed
Atmosphere was cool(seedly feel) and the pizza was pretty good(nothing amazing)
Service was very poor to non existent at times
Appetizers were horrific
One taste of the ministrone soup and it obviously came from a can
Who eats canned soup let alone serves it at their restaurant? Salad was not edible
Not touching your appetizer is apparently normal for the wait staff, they never said a thing
Advice, get a pizza to go
I was looking forward to trying this pizza after reading all the rave reviews
Taste is a subjective thing, and I'm not laying down the law here, but I found the pizza to be slightly too cheesy
It was clearly good, and a cut above most NYC pizza, but a tell-tale sign was that I started to feel full after 2 and a half slices
You can bet that doesn't happen at Totonno's!  The place is crowded and a little cramped, but has a nice atmosphere
On a recent hot late afternoon we sat outside and enjoyed a great 'regular' pizza
There were several tables outside and the service was efficient and courteous
This was our first coal-oven pizza and it was delicious: Crispy, great cheese, and just the right amount of sauce
This place is absolutely wonderful! Old photos decorate the walls of this restaurant, and every time I've dined there, they've had a musician performing and filling the room with music
The food is hearty, flavorful and delicious
They also have delicious seafood: raw clams and steamed mussels in a savory garlic and wine sauce
Superb
I am a pizza conasieur and this is by far the best pizza
Even if I am stuffed I will keep eating the pizza until I can't anymore
I get cravings for this unique coal oven pizza
It is really light and it is nothing like you have tasted
It simply is
THE BEST
The food here is great, and it goes way back as a local jazz venue
But the service was unremarkable and really slow (40 minutes to get wine and antipasto)
They're not really a wine place, and for god's sake don't sit outside
They're on a corner; on one side you'll be dripped on by the air conditioners above, and on the other side you'll be sitting in the hot blast from their own AC
Not to mention the traffic on Houston st
Inside is a different story
It's not quiet, but it's a great place to see local jazz guys doing their thing
The pizza is some of the best in the city
I went to Arturo's recently with a large party
They did their best with seating us as fast as they could, on a busy saturday night
Which was pretty fast! And everyone found something on the menu that that wanted
And LOVED! I had the mussels and absolutely devoured them! The garlic bread with the maranara dipping sause was yummy too! I reccomend Arturo's highly!
Pizza, cold beer, live music and pasta
what more could you ask for? The pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is something that you would expect from the olden days
Would recommend being patient because the lines can be long at this West Village/Soho staple
The Scene If the whiff of homemade peanut butter doesn't grip you, then butter-yellow walls lined with vintage tins and classic ads for Sunbeam bread and Welch's jam are bound to make you feel good
Aside from a milk selection that includes soy, rice and Lactaid, the novelty rings true
Kids, parents and everyone in between appreciate the old-fashioned sandwiches served with a pile of chips and carrot sticks
The Draw Though the "Elvis"--grilled peanut butter, honey, bananas and bacon--reigns king, many of the sandwiches on the menu are sweeter compositions
Oddly enough, the kitchen turns out a heck of a tuna melt and a particularly tasty grilled cheese
Feel free to save your peanut butter for dessert: Milk shakes, cookies and sundaes (one with peanut butter Cap'n Crunch) are worth the trip alone
The Bananarama Split with peanut butter, graham crackers, whipped cream and chocolate sauce has a cult-like following
i took my little sister here on saturday before seeing the circus and it was fun! sure, its $6 for a peanut butter sandwich, but this is ny where else are you going to get interesting flavours like spicy peanut? i had their daily special sandwich, which happened to be chocolate peanut butter mint
delicious dark chocolate peanut butter with mint jelly
my little sis tried the cookie dough surprise cream cheese, chocolate chips, and peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)
it didnt taste like its namesake, but it was interesting
sandwiches come with complimentary sides of chips and carrot sticks
staff are heavy-handed with the spreads
wash down your sandwich with a variety of milks/drinks
the store also sells a bunch of peanut related foods, so grab a jar of their gourmet peanut butters or a can of roasted peanuts ($5/can try the barbeque flavour)
my friend and i decided that the guy who took our orders was yummy--probably yummier than the sandwich
the crust was a bit stale, the peanutbutter was a bit runny, and the potato chips had a funny (stale?) after taste
it was OKAY
they were out of bagles, the building is a bit cramped and over $9
oo for a sandwich and drink is a little much
however i was full when i left
also, when i asked for one sandwich, they were out of one of the ingredients so i ahd to get another (they couldn't run to a grceory store and pick it up when they ran out?! gosh
)
I have been to pb co many times
Service is the worst part about this place due to alot of young teenagers running the show, what would you expect? The best part is their desserts, I love them and so does anyone else i have ever brought there
I would go there for dessert and the peanut butter sampler so you can pick what you would like to buy
I have also seen a plate with fire in the middle that is a smore maker, looks good

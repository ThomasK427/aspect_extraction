i love this place for dinner
they have a very nice menu and the service is very good they take care of you when your there
you should try it
My bf lives on the same block so we have plenty of chances to go there but we never go after 3 visits
Yes, their decor is very warming and trendy but their food is worse than any diner food i've had
They make it look 'trendy' by decorating the plates but fish dish was dry and so was the meat
We also tried their brunch too but what a disaster
Go here if you want some drinks(their wine menu is ok) and some good time with friends but otherwise, cook at home
The ambiance here is wonderful, which is why its such a shame the food drastically fails to live up to it
I've eaten there twice - dinner was overcooked and boring grilled shrimp and bland pasta
For two, with wine and dessert, this came to $90
Brunch was a greasy omellete and a passable frittata
The food is simply not good - the chef seems to trying to experiment but doesn't have the skills to back it up
This is a modest neighborhood restaurant trying to be something more than it is, and charging its customers way more than it should for the attempt
Wineturtle has only snacked so its back to try the grub
Wine has had C-Tails at the bar(SUPRISE!!!) and was happy
B-tender actually can use Boston Shaker in the correct way,rare for new breed of drink Chefs
Glasswine was hit or miss but found something or two on the list
Priced equal to the area
Played Bargames with people at the bar and used the stick matches to do those move thh match to make
games Until 3ish A
M
closetime and was not alone
Reminds Wineturtle of G-Village in the 60's lot of trendy people not knowing that they are trendy
Mayor Mike this place needs indoor smoking to complete the vibe
will talk on food soon
From the moment you walk in to the second you leave you forget that your in New York let alone Astoria
Every detail is taken care of from fresh flowers on every table to the creative menu in both style and options
Friends and I tried many appetizers and entrees so I was able to sample numerous choices from the menu
The waitstaff would ask as they cleared our empty plates if everything was OK? We'd joke saying sorry we hated it as we'd hurry to scrap up any last morsel with the bread from our plates before they took them away
I have come back several times since and have been equally satisfied on each visit
Thank You Brick Cafe for making a neighborhood place such a great dining experience
A very consistant, well prepared meal in Astoria
Charming decor and friendly staff
They offer an amazing Brunch that shouldn't be missed
The could improve their champagne choice and offer more by the glass
this neighborhood was in dire need of a restaurant with atmosphere and brick cafe fit the bill beautifully - and the food is great! it is consistently good and the service is right on
i've had fantastic fish and pasta dishes here and they don't skimp on portions
in warm weather you can dine al fresco
the mood is romantic and candlelit, great for dates
next door is the brick cafe bar where you can go for a nightcap
you really need to check this place out one night
Wonderful food, cozy setting and really personable service here
Will certainly return
Astoria needs more places like this!
This place is a jewel in Astoria
Highly recommend brunch, sophisticated and elegant, this place stands out like a sore thumb in Astoria
Do the trek and you will not be disappointed, before it becomes popular, enjoy it while you can
The atmosphere is of an European bistro, Amelie soundtrack playing in the background, wonderful, sweet servers and delicious food
Love it all, especially for brunch!!
I hate being wrong and hearing my lady tell me that she told me so but I have to give it to her
Brick Cafe is great! Romanticly dimly lit, the meals are prepared with detail and the waitstaff are good looking and friendly
Don't mind spending my money there and it made the old lady happy
Viva la Brick Cafe!
Just a stones throw outside the city, is the perfect little brunch site
The hostess is a local girl with an infectious smile that makes you feel right at home
The menu has a multitude of temptations that carries you from breakfast to lunch flawlessly
The Brick cafe staff are friendly, efficient and professional
The greatest pleasure is the elegant simplicity
some of the trendier city brunch spots should take a lesson from the borough who knows how to enjoy a meal!!!!
The cafe is airy and bright with a cheerful atmosphere
The staff are professional and friendly
The hardest decision was what to choose of the menu, my complements to the chef! Brick cafe captures the essence of the european cafes
A place where old friends meet, eat good food, drink good wine and create good times
I can't recomend it enough
It's rare to find french food in New York that doesn't set you back in terms of $$
It's even rarer to have large portions, friendly waistaff and an intimate time
Chez Isabelle's was all that
It feels like being in the neighborhood eatery in Paris, and with the number of French people dropping in that night it pretty much was
The proprietress was friendly and helpful, paying a lot of attention to my wife and I
She is also georgeous, an added benefit to this little eatery
Bon Appetit!!
I've been meaning to write this review for some time as I have never been disappointed by my numerous visits here
During a recent celebration for a friends birthday, our entire group, 2 of 6 visisting for the 1st time, could not extend enough praise for the food, serice and atmosphere - [the perfect tri-fecta !!]
Notable mentions must include the delicious seafood paella and savory sangrias; the exemplary service of both Renee and Giovanni - they make you feel like you have known them all your life and the authentic murals and live band
It can be genuinely felt that both staff and guests are having a great time !!   I have heard rumors of a possible expansion
My only reservation would be - that may ruin the romantic feel to this very special place
Kudos to everyone
This place is great! a little wait and a little small but the serice was great and prompt! Will continue to go there and tell people about it
I discovered this returant 9 months ago during my last visit to NYC
When planing a recent trip with my family, I knew that I had to introduce them to Havana Alma de Cuba
The food is wonderful, the staff is friendly, and the sangria is definitely worth the cross country trip
This past visit we were lucky enough to be served by Fabian
We found him charming, attentive, and witty
He and the entire staff definitely made our evening
Thank you all
Just went here last night and can't wait to return
Warm staff, well-seasoned Cuban dishes (I had the arroz con pollo and beef empanadas)
We ate in the (covered) garden during the thunderstorm, a lovely spot for intimate eats with friends or a date
A bit of seltzer in the classic mojitos gave them a nice kick
I had a surprise dinner party for my husband here
The whole family loved it
We reserved the back room
Fabulous
I never want toseat no where else
The wait staff was wonderful
We were not made to feel rush even though some members of the party arrived late and there was a seating after us
Everything was wonderful, Had a great time
Becuase of that experience I have gone back again and all seem to love it
I made a reservation for my boyfriends birthday and as expected our little table was reserved

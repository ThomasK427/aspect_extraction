Dropped in without a reservation at 5:30pm
We were seated immediately
Staff was busy but attentive
Food wasn't spectacular, but pretty good
Wife had lasagna and commented 'too much cheese on top'
I had a tortellini dish which was pretty good
Ceasar salad dressing was too thin and croutons were stale
Dessert of tiramisu was good
We came from the LA area for a weekend in NY
We discovered this from Citysearch, and the ratings were right
The food was excellent and they had a lot of reasonably priced good Italian wines
We loved our server
We'd go back, but its 2500 miles away
Though somewhat small and cramped, the wonderful food and spectacular service make this a cut above other nearby Italian fare
The dessert cart is to die and the staff is friendly and attentive
You can't go wrong with this one and it's a bargain to boot!
Early evening dinner with my 3 year old grandaughter, son and daughter in law
We arrived with a mcdonald's milk shake that my grandaughter would not give up
We were willing to throw it away, this wonderful staff wouldnt hear of it and made her feel special by putting it in a glass like ours therefore making everyone happy
Did I mention the food is excellent
I go there every time I am in NYC
I am never disappointed
Sincerly, L
Dennis Ocean City Md
I read the other positive reviews, so I had to check it out
and they were right on
You can not go wrong with any dish, however, the Veal Sorentino could potentially be the best in the city! The staff is certainly friendly, and the prices are phenominal
Also, the creativeness behind their daily specials is brilliant! An A+ all around
For what it tries to accomplish--provide tasty food, with great service at reasonable prices--there is no finer place in NYC
All around a tremendous place to grab a great lunch or dinner!
This is the best place to go! Amazing service, delicious homemade food, very reasonable
I would recommend this to everyone!!! The calamari fritti melt in your mouth and make sure you save room for dessert because the Chocolate Mousse Cake is to die for!!!!!! Definitely need to try it out!
We we seated right away
The service was great
The food was great
The tiramisu was amazing! It was reasonably priced
I would go to this resturant again and again
!
The service was great, the food was terrific, the atmosphere was nice, and the value beyond belief
To find a great reasonably priced Italian restaurant in the theater district was fantastic
We will definitely eat here again
I LOVE this place! I think it's romantic and cozy and a truly terrific restaurant
No matter what I order, it's always delicious and their tiramisu is not to be missed!
As an avid visitor to the Broadway district, when desiring Italian food, my family always visits Trecolori
Without exception, this is the finest Italian resturant that I or my family have ever eaten at
The food is incredible as is the service
To the owners and staff, Thank you and we will see you again soon
Excellent food and service
The best meal we had in NYC
The Veal Martini is to die for
The night we found this place they were getting ready to close and the owner asked us to please come back
When we went back the next night, he recognized us
I worked across the street from this gem of a restaurant for more than a year, and never failed to eat lunch there at least once a week, or to arrange to meet with clients, business associates, family and friends there when possible
The food is heavenly (try the puttanesca bianca- olives, roasted garlic, capers, slivers of anchovy in a light chicken-broth and white wine sauce with lots of lemon and pepper over linguine, or the amazing amatriciana sauce with pancetta and sweet onions in a delicate tomato puree), the waiters know my name the second time I went, as well as my favorite table and smoking preference
Everything on the menu is so reasonably priced and sooooo good that you can not go wrong, and the waiters and staff are so friendly and helpful that you will feel like you're dining with family
I went out with someone to this restaurant
We liked the outdoor seating, but we thought it was extreemly rude that the waiter kept asking us if we were done, but then it got worse
He stood behind our table and watched us and kept asking us from there if we were through yet
Then, I put my fork down while I was chewing, and he tried to take my plate! Then a minute later he brought us our check and said they were closing shortly
It was 9:45
I continued talking, and he clapped to get my attention and asked how I was paying
I paid, we left
Never to return
Given the plethora of places to have dessert in the Times Square/Theatre District, this has to rank very low on the list of plaes you should go
With several tables clearly open and available, we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated
Then the actual desserts were not much better than those available in most delis
The cakes were dry
the mousse bland
and the coffee not fresh and burnt
$7 for a piece of cheesecake which was slightly better than average
Convenient to theaters / time square
A good non-bar spot to talk to a friend
Service was brash/hurried despite the place being empty
the best food
the most accomadating service
a little pricy but well worth it
The Scene Frankie and Johnnie's opened as a speakeasy in 1926, and it retains much of that atmosphere, with deep velvet benches and tiny wooden tables
Though the room is no longer filled with smoke, it feels as though it should be
Big windows with heavy blinds look out on Eighth Avenue
Waiters are slow but meticulous, caring for every detail
The Food Steaks are well-aged and perfectly broiled: The T-bone in particular is juicy and full of flavor, and the porterhouse for two is also top-quality
Outside the realm of steak, things aren't so certain: The pork chops can be a bit tough, lobster tails aren't the greatest and the "special salad" isn't
The chopped-liver appetizer, though, is among the city's best
I brought my girl into the city for a night of good eats and the theatre
Frankie Johnnie's made my night! Not only did we get limo service to and from the restaurant - but the dinner was amazing
If it was up to me, I would have rathered to stay there all night then go to the play!
I must start off by saying that my boyfriend THINKS he works for Zagat
We go out and he critiques
No matter what, he always has something to say - something could have been better
Frankie Johnnie's silenced the critique
He did not have a single complaint! THANK YOU! The food was phenominal, service on-point and the limo service put this place off the charts
This is my new favorite place! I am so glad I decided to check it out
Me and my friends went here for dinner on Saturday
Food was great, atmosphere was terrific, real old school New York
Felt like we were in a movie or something
Server was very cool to us and didn't rush us out
The food and service was absolutely terrific!! I would recommend this place to anyone
It is the best steak ever!! Service was wonderful too
I love this place
Whenever me and my husband come into the city I make him take me here

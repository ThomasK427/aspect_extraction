The only decent thing about this place was the bread with good dipping sauce
Other than that, save your money time on another place
Will never go again
One of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at- and my friends and I jokingly refer to ourselves as Team Food so guess how much I eat out
Every thing was perfect- the food, the service, the spot itself
We started with mixed apetizers- I really think that's the best way to go
We all ordered different things for entres and desserts so that we could all taste each others
And everything was amazing
I especially liked the desserts- the baklava isn't as sweet as the Greek stuff I'm used to in the neighborhood
and this sweet porridge like dessert was simply heaven
Mombar's a great place for a nice dinner with a friend or two
The decorations really are amazing, and the chef might come over to say hi when you're done eating
I really recommend the mixed appetizers -- I don't know what they call it, but it has a little of everything
I didn't like the dessert I had there once -- but that might have just been my taste
A drawback: I don't think they take credit cards
Also, their hours are a little random, so check ahead
Possibly the most amazing looking restaurant in NY, all the more so because the chef made everything himself
The food, service and decor of this hidden Egyptian gem are top notch
The design of Mombar's building (the facade was designed by Chef Moustafa himself as were the tables and wall hangings inside) drove us to look inside, and when we did we were showered with warm smiles and hot Egyptian delicacies
The glazed duck was unbelievable as was the appetizer sampler
If you have time to visit Queens, make sure you visit Mombar
Mombar is a just that, an oasis in the middle of a busy market street in Astoria
The surrounding atmoshere mirrors one of those Discovery channel types of busy Moroccan markets
The food is absolutely and positively the tastiest of all Egyptian/ Middle Eastern delights you can find around
The exquisitelly and tastefully designed mosaic tables and restaurant space--designed by the chef/ owner-- create a perfect setting for exotic dinner
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the service was really good
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure
Love the Happy Roll and Eel Roll
For some strange reason Sunday and Mondays fish is not as fresh as other days
Happy hour is a bang for the buck
my fiance and i go to oki a few times a month
they have a great happy hour (2 for 1 pieces, half price rolls i think) sushi
some of my favorite meals have been the red white sushi and the alaska rolls
the staff is very nice and friendly
In Short Boomerangs, Aussie flags, kangaroo portraits and faux aboriginal art honor the homeland's wilderness, but Outback delivers a polished version of rusticity with varnished blond-wood booths with matching wainscoting and casually uniformed waitstaff
Besides more than a half-dozen cuts of steak, diners can pick from large-portioned entrees like ribs, chops and shrimp or chicken "on the barbie
" The Bloomin' Onion, a large onion dipped in batter and deep-fried, is an appetizer with a following
Some Outback rests are offering a service where you order ahead, drive to the place, and they bring it out to you; not sure if this one on Bell has it yet, but they should if they don't
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare
Bay Terrace mall is nothing (ok, almost nothing) without it!!
I have followed the chefs at Pacific for over 20 years and I have enjoyed every meal
Originating from NYC Chinatown, this restaurant has what it takes for me to be a regular patron
I used to eat at Pacific several times a week, until I moved out to the suburbs and I long to return for some excellent Chinese food
The food is affordable and always fresh because the restaurant is always busy
You can't beat the prices with live seafood starting at $6
95
Try it, and I guarantee you'll love it!
looking for jap in queens??? look no further SATO is the place to be!!!
I love this quaint restaurant in Forest Hills
The owner himself does the ordering, and insures the food is always fresh
The service is friendly and very helpful
They do offer specials daily that are not written in the menu, so make sure you ask them for the daily specials
I highly recommend this restaurant, it serves the best Japanese food in Queens! So if you're looking for great Japanese food without driving in to the city, this is it!
If you are looking for a moderately priced Sushi place with a nice low key ambiance you will be surprised what this little GEM Offers
In the middle of Queens Blvd, this spot makes a great dinner place before the big night on a town
Expect to spend on average of $50 to $70 for two people with some drinks and FRIED CHEESCAKE Dessert
(A must)
IMO Great value for quality food
My husband and I LOVE this place
Generally we just have rolls and sushi, but they also have main course dishes
The appetizers are great
consisting of the usual, gyoza, edamame plus other apps like scallops in spicy mayo sauce (excellent), grilled squid, etc
In general, a good deal for the quality (affordable but not cheap)
I've never had bad sushi here
And leave room for desert
try the fried cheesecake - it's actually pretty light (for cheesecake)! If you have a large group, make reservations
Small Indian restaurant with great food and great service
The restaurant's namesake dish is a must try
One of the best sauces you'll ever have
Great value
Dinner for 2 shouldn't run you more than $40 and can easily end up under $25
Reminds me of when I visit japan
Real japanese taste
Only downfall is that its closed on Mondays
but any other day, its open pretty late
a quaint and small hole in this busy and bustling block, many are opening up food stores way to fast without testing out their menu
this isnt really authentic japanese as other reviewers have claimed but rather a hawaiian spin off of true japanese food
the big draw teriyaki is bland and tasteless, test your taste buds elsewhere!
Oh my god!!! As I was born and raised in Japan, I can say that this is a real Japanese food, not like restaurant food but domestic food
All of their food are that everyone in Japan loves
I don't know if it's good for Americans, but if you want to try Japanese moms home cooking type of Japanese food, GO TO TOKYO TERIYAKI!!!
I love this place! You have to look hard to find it (or stumble upon it, like I did), but it's worth it
Yummy Japanese food, I love the katsu curry and katsudon
And for anyone with ties to Hawaii, the couple that owns the place used to live in Hawaii, and you can get spam musubi there! Mmmm
As a person from Japan, I love this place
The owner is Japanese and the food tast real Japanese food
This is a small restaurant and most people get food to go
Price is very reasonable
Whenever I am tired, I buy some food from here as a treat for me
I like Katsu Curry, Chikin Kara-age, Seafood salad, eal and cucumber roll
My American friend loves Salmon Teriyaki
My Korian friend loves Spicy-tune roll and Seaweed Salad
You shoud go if you want to tast real Japanese tast food
If you are looking for a nice European meal, then here's your place
Good food, lively atmosphere, and a nice homey feel is what Tricolorii is all about
And the Thursday Ladies Night drink specials are hard to beat
Tricolorii is where the local Romanian community goes for a glass or a bottle of Romanian wine and where there is good wine you will always find good food
Although the meals are not exactly cheap they are decent and the lunch specials are great (lunch is till 6)
Thursdays are ladies nights, the perfect opportunity to try Blue Ice, one of the owners specials, you won't find this drink anywhere
Tricolorii is an interesting restaurant that many like to call home, the perfect place for a drink, dessert or a meal

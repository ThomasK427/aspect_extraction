the dou sashimi with the espresso-soy is to die for! my friend had the salmon riette and said that it was magnificent (she loves the curry dressing) then i had the lamb chops with the most delicius potatoes puree i had ever taste (green !!!) and my friend had the shrimps that was nice, but not amazing like the rest
we were full and ordered just coffee and tea, but the chef sent us some of his home made ice cream, saying he couldnt send us home without trying any of his dessert so that was the most unexpected part: lemongrass vanilla, five spices chinese chocolat (unbelivable)and coconut with citrus zests
during the night we had a nice service, and i'm sure, i'll be back there
this is a real good chance to take
GREAT NIGHT OUT! I have been to Chance a few times now - you cannot beat the amazing food and the wonderul service
It was a culinary delight - one time I had the filet (to die for) and another the lamb chops (delicious); both time I started with the Ocean Box dim sum (woah) and the desserts (creme brulee, banana spring roll) are fabulous
But the place would only be ok if the food was great - the wonderful service makes the whole experience that much better and allows you to truly enjoy all the epicurean delights
Plus, the atmosphere is perfect for dining - the lighting is dimmed just so, making it possible to not sit in glare but still being able to see your food and your fellow diner
I highly recoommend Chance - EAT HERE!
The food here is a very good deal for the price and portions are very large
The filet mignon, lamb, and creme brulee were all excellent, while the salmon rillette appetizer was disappointing
The Scene Energetic servers whip about the dining room, describing dishes--"the crust is made from dehydrated cashews; the noodles are made from squash"--to a curious and somewhat skeptical audience
Fuchsia high-backed chairs punch color into the dimly lit room
In seasonal weather, the outdoor patio, a gorgeous expanse surrounded by thriving herbs, captivates
The Food Because everything on the plate is organic, dairy- and meat-free, and--gasp--entirely raw, dining here can be distracting; it's difficult not to analyze each bite
What's surprising is that everything is delicious
Standout starters include lettuce wraps filled with mango, cabbage, ginger and cashews and an outstanding tamarind-chili sauce
Ambitious entree creations, like squash pasta in truffle sauce with shaved truffles and lasagna with a striking basil-pistachio pesto and ricotta made from pignola nuts, are worthy of a return visit
A blueberry tart with lemon verbena ice cream is a summery finish
I have to admit that Pure Food and Wine ranks as one of my favorite vegan restaurants in terms of food and creativity, if only it had the service to match
Given the price of an average meal, I was very unimpressed with both the attitude of the servers and the lack of attentivness
While pretentiousness is not normally one of my pet peeves, the Maitre'D went too far
I saw him yell at one couple attempting to expedite the service, and actually kick out a family of four because they had the audacity to ask for quicker service
It's sad to see food so good ruined by a couple of hiring mistakes
I went here for the first time with six friends from out of town for a celebration
I was the only vegan in our party and the only one from NYC
My friends absolutely loved this restaurant
We sat out back in the garden and it was peaceful and calming in the heart of the city
Our waiter was adorable, friendly and sociable
He took the time to proudly explain all the dishes, and since we were all very interested in the recipes, he invited us to have a walk thru their kitchen
It was spectacular! Spotlessly clean and bright, with a friendly staff of chefs who seemed to love being at their jobs! Yes, I want these happy people preparing my food! We took our time and enjoyed hanging out here, tried many of the appetizers, all ordered different entrees' to have a taste of each others, then relaxed and talked while waiting for the amazing desserts to arrive
There was no sense of being hurried thru our evening
Even the owner, who happened to be there enjoying dessert at the next table, came over to say hello
Pure Food is a total sensation experience for the eyes as well as the tastebuds
Every thing was wonderful, and beautifully presented
When our bill came, not one of us was disappointed
$65 bucks each, and in NYC, that's a bargain
It was worth every penny
I'm looking forward to going again
Can't believe I've lived here my whole life and never went
Everything good you hear about Pure Food and Wine is true
Forget about the portion size complaints
there's enough food to fill you up and the meal is extremely satisfying on many levels
Worth every penny, if not more
Ambience is almost worth the price tag, that is the outside garden area on a beautiful night
However, for the average non-vegan diner, the prices for the amount of food served (probably less than a fistful of edible grub) may be too raw
We spent $150 (this including a bottle of wine, 2 additional glasses, appetizers, and entrees) and were starving afterwards
It may be a novel experience, but don't expect heaping portions
However, the food was fresh and (somewhat) tasty, especially for vegan cuisine
First time eating vegan/raw, did the tasting menu
Everything was amazing and fresh
Didnt love the bayleaf sorbet, but it was a good palette cleanser
Desserts and wine were the highlight, try the chocolate mint sundae and tiramisu
Servers were kind and knowledgeable and fun, we had a great time talking to them
Overall great night
Pretty expensive but worth it, will be back for sure
As a raw foodist, Pure is a dream
It's one of the only places we raw, vegan, 100% organics can eat guilt-free
I fequent the take-out and go to dinner every few months (can't afford more often)
The food is always inventive, delicious, and perfectly portioned (unless you're accustomed to super-sizing)
The ambience is great
The bills are stunning
But you can't get food like this anywhere
My bone is the service
It's awful
The wait staff are friendly, but they disappear after they take initial drink and food order
Unless you flag them down, you're on your own
On my last visit, my wine emptied after my appetizer but I was never asked if I wanted another glass
I wasn't even offered water
Appetizer plates were not cleared
We were never asked how our food was
I sincerely hope the management gets to work on this problem
I was expecting a much better dining experience
I found the menu to be apealing but the actual food was only average, while the prices seemed too high for the offerings, especially considering the size of the portions
It won't be my first choice for a healthy yet tasty experience (probably won't be my second or even third choice)
Towards the end of my meal the service was extremely slow and lacking
If you decide to try this place come prepared to spend a lot of time and a lot of money
The meals do seem skimpy compared with traditional American serving sizes
Keep in mind that the they use the freshest, organic and local ingredients
All dishes are made fresh daily, and many to order
The service is acceptional and the staff is knowledgeable about all of the dishes and the extensive organic wine selection
I could not afford to eat here everynight
But, I choose Pure when I want an awe inspiring meal in an enchanting setting
I love coming here
The food is incredible, the ambience is marvelous and the waitors are the cutest
What more could one ask for? After an incredible dining experience, my friends and I were pleasantly astonished when the bill arrived
We lost track of how much each item on the menu cost but had an enjoyable evening
Goes to show: every great thing has a price
My only complaint is that all the dishes have nuts seeds, so if one is allergic to either of these, it's not the ideal restaurant
We knew based on other reviews here that it would be expensive, but as a novelty we wanted to try it
It was definitely worth having an unusual experience (thai roll ups and the lasagna are must haves!)
But we each got an appetizer, an entree and a dessert, along with 2 cocktails each and the bill was $162
It was insane
If you want to try it, I'd skip the $13 drinks (or save them for another time when you come just for drinks)
That would cut down on the price
But for what you get, and how not-full you are when you leave, the price is way too hefty to come more than once or twice a year -- if that
the concept is hard for most to get
live food
however after experiencing it, one can not denie what the live, organic, vegan ingredients do to your senses--it's pure abundence for your body and spirit
The portions are not 'traditional' American-super -size, it's not neccessary, each slow bite is so gradifying and full of flavor, your left content and happy rather weighed down and full

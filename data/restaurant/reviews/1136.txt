WE SAT ON THEIR OUTSIDE SEATING AREA
IT WAS SO PLEASANT
FOOD WAS SO DELICIOUS
WE COULD NOT STOP EATING
ALL THE DISHES WE TRIED WERE SO SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS
SERVICE WAS VERY INFORMATIVE
AND ATTENTIVE
I CAN NOT WAIT TO GO BACK
THANKS

Last summer we were there when they first opened

A

Same satisfactory, great food
Service
interior
We were hoped to sit in their cute side walk cafe
but because of the wheather it was not open
we trully enjoyed the specials
highly highly recommend this hidden place
we just wanted to drink something at their happy hour
we end up staying at least 4 hours
drinking and eating their fab tapas dishes
beatiful interior, great service with big smile and ofcourse fantastic food
we are lucky to discover this bar
Through a recommendation from a friend ,I decided to give a visit to Zipi Zape
When I entered the restaurant Iwas taken aback by so authentic cold tapas bar right by the entrance
Everything was so colorful
Try the 10 tapas tasting menu
Tortilla espanola was the most flaky ,delicious tortilla I've tried
Then slowly find your way to the hot tapas menu
Bechamel croquetas,choricitos,grilled gambas,chipironcitos
everything we had was fantastic
and the finale
warm chocolate souffle
the best I've had so far
LOOKING FORWARD TO COME FOR MORE
loin of pork,camarones al ajillo, mushrooms, pulpo a la gallega,fried baby calamari, scallops, chese plate, jamon serrano
more and more
we enjoyed every single dish
each of them was preped with care
highly highly recoomend this place
MUST GO PLACE
TOP ON MY LIST
GREAT DECOR, GREAT SERVICE
VERY CLOSE TO MANHATTAN
LOVED IT
TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
BEHALF THE SPANISH RESTAURANTS IVE BEEN INTO
THE BEST OF ALL
MY FRIEND IS A REGULAR CUSTOMER
BEFORE HE ORDERED FROM THE MENU HE GOT MOST OF THE SPECIALS
THAT NIGHT THEY WERE SERVING SUNNY SIDE UP QAIL EGGS OVER CHORIZO AND MIMI POTATO PANCAKE
WAS SO CUTE AND THE FLAVOR WAS UNBELIEVABLE
MONK FISH PATE WAS DIE FOR
I PERSONALY ALSO LIKED THE FRIED BABY CALAMARI, LOIN OF PORK AND GALICIAN STYLE OCTOPUS
SERVICE WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND FRIENDLY
I WILL BE BACK WITH MORE PEOPLE
If I could go out to eat everynight I would like to come and eat here
There is something for everyone
Very atractive and tasty menu
Great Sangria
beer and wine selection
Feels like you are in Spain
We were there last night
The place was packed
combination of europians and Americans
Was very pleasant
I am little bit of shock about the previous review as well
To me who ever wrote this review does not have any clue about spanish food
I also highly suggest that person to take a look at the NEW YORK TIMES sunday issues to see Spain's upcoming high end can products
Yes they use some of these products in a very genious way but their hot tapas selection comes right out from the oven or grill
Obviously these people opinions were only one sited
They did not try the hot tapas dishes
Again very happening place
we were glad to be there
I AM VERY SURPRISED TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEW

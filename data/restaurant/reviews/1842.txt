Good food, but the service is horrible
After being seated with my dinner party it took 15 minutes before we even got someone to look at our table
Funny thing the restaurant was empty
The waitress paid close attention to all the patrons dinning outside the restaurant, but when she finally got to our table she never introducted herself
She then informed us that what ever you wanted had to be gotten now because the kitchen closed at 10:30pm, it's now 10:50
Had to ask her who she was, never offered water, disappeared after she brought our food
The next time we saw her is when we wanted to pay the check she came over and said are you done? I would never in my life go here again or recommend it to anyone
Well maybe if you wanted to feed you dog
Knowing nothing about the restaurant, we stumbled upon it last night and was more than pleasantly surprised
I would highly recommend it for the huge, inexpensive meal and enormous amount of choices
All three meals we had were great and the service was perfect
I'd definitely go back and recommend it to anyone looking for a restaurant in the area
I thought the location, the room, and the service were a pleasant departure from the aloof/trendy restaurants in NYC - but the food was a MAJOR disappointment - I hope this was an unusual experience as this restaurant had been recommended
This place has a convienent location and has plenty of options for all tastes! Their mock meats are EXCELLENT and from the few times I have been there, I don't really have any complains
I liked VP2 before I went vegetarian and now that I'm vegan, I love it!!!
They added some pretty cool items to their ever expanding menu
The BBQ ribs is mouth watering and finger liiiiicking good
Highly recommended
Beer battered portobello is another must try
This place is still the bomb
The Soul Chix and Garlic Mashed Potatoes are a MUST have!!!
I've been coming to VP2 for years, their menu is just exceptional and expanding
love their citrus chicken and chicken and fries
I wish they bring back the Taro Fish, my all time favorite
Staff are friedly, and you get the best value for your money
I've always recommend this place to my friends when they come visit the Big Apple
This place ranks among the worst I've been to
Soup was a gelatinous goopy mess with a really vague flavor to it
Our main dishes were also soggy messes
Overcooked, unflavorful vegetables in yet the same goopy sauce
Unbelievable
I can't understand how it got such great reviews
Service was fast and professional, which was the only highlight
There is definitely no ambience to the place, though it trys
Also - what is the deal with it being a self proclaimed ZEN restaurant?!? good grief
We are traveling with a couple who believe in meat 3 meals a day, but since tey;ve never been to NYC and we had, we took them where we wanted to go
We (my husband and I - both vegetarians) and they, were all happy
The other guy, avid carnivore, ate every bite
The portions are very large, and the meat substitutes were very convincing
The menu has a varied selection, it was hard to choose
I like the location too, Greenwich Village is fun to walk around
My partner and I have been members of The Kitchen Club for almost three years and even today it continues to surprise us with wonderful new dishes and that remarkable romantic feeling we felt on our very first visit one evening in late September
Tonight we even managed to sit at the same table with a perfect view of the original St
Patricks Cathedral
The service was wonderful and well paced
And of course, there is Chibi, those in the know will know who I am talking about
(Ask where is Chibi?) everything on the menu is delicious especially, Marja's(the owner) dumplings
Anybody looking to spend a leisurely evening with friends and loved ones, join The Kitchen Club, still taking new members even after 15 years since it all started
Food took so long doesn't worth for the high price
Service bad, waitress never come back check on us and charged us 20% service charge for 4 party people just because she think we are tourist
She was mean when we asked her about the service charge she included in the bill
DON'T WAIST MONEY TO GO EAT AT THIS PLACE
BAD and HORRIBLE!!!!
I arrived at the restaurant on time for my reservation at 7:30pm on Saturday April 1st
The restaurant was not full but the host wanted to seat us in the back dark bar room
When asked why we couldn't sit in the front room, which was not full, he said I just can't sorry
He was extremely rude and when I asked to see the manager he stalled
So, we went to Public around the corner and had a great meal instead! If you like being treated badly go to this restaurant, otherwise don't bother!
My date and I made last dinner service
That's no excuse to be ignored by the server, but she forgot my wine, our water, never came by to check on us, and couldn't even bother to bring our check (the owner did)
Menu items are well thought out - the head chef really knows ingredients
Unfortunately staff was lacking
Pumpkin soup was foamy - lacking the depth expected from winter soup
Shrimpspinach dumplings came out stone cold
Crab cakes were tasty but greasy - fryer temp was off
Salmon with orange sauce was an excellent recipe, but the grill master charred the salmon skin - instead of crunchy goodness I got a mouth full of bitter charcoal
Japanese dinner box was decent but unspectacular - especially disappointing was the pickled meat (pork? chicken?) - tasteless and undefined
The chicken teriyaki was very tasty
Overall - overpriced given the spotty quality
My favorite thing about Kitchen Club is that no matter what the weather or season, it is always the perfect place to be, romantic in a downpour, intimate when it's chilly, graciously open when it's fine
The food is superb, beginning with delectable dumplings, delicious seared tuna or quail, a nice wine selelction
Pretty and welcoming, the whole experience is a reliably happy one, and one that I am delighted to share
As a busy New Yorker, I find myself in restaurants at least three times a week, and look hard to find places with high quality organic foods, that are deliciously prepared
I was delighted to discover The Kitchen Club whose imaginative mix of Japanese and French food intrigued me
Dumplings are a house specialty, and the mushroom dumplings with a hint of ginger were fabulous
The crab cakes were also great, and my favorite was the chocolate mousse, with chunks of chocolate and not overly sweet
It was some of the very best mousse Ive ever had
The atmosphere presentation is warm and romantic, lively, and not too noisy
The atmosphere, handsome and unfussy presentation, the courteous service, the quirky photographs and spectacular bouquets of flowers made it a great evening
I cant wait to go back
I have to say, I was totally appalled by the Chef's behavior
I watched as the Chef and Waitstaff treated the table near us with such disregard and total and utter rudeness
I felt embarassed as I sat there and did nothing
It was one of those moments I wish I had the courage to get up and leave but I didn't
The food was very disappointing but then what could really taste good knowing the chef was so disrespectful
It seems that this restaurant is nice to a chosen few, and the rest get treated like garbage
Even if my meal had been amazing(which it definitely was not), I would not return on principle
You managed to not only ruin the particlar table's evening, but also those seated near them as we could not help but watch this debacle in shock and horror
To celebrate our marriage, we recently invited 35 friends to join us at The Kitchen Club, and the combination of intimate surroundings, brilliant food and wonderful service made for an evening we'll never forget
We gathered early at Chibi's next door for drinks and then were treated to cooking as inventive and nuanced as on a regular night, which is rarely the case when you take over a restaurant
With all the windows/doors open, The Kitchen Club's interior, jewel-like on its own, became even more entrancing -- this may be the perfect Manhattan corner for a restaurant
And we were able to give our complete attention, all evening, to our friends
We've never thrown a better party
The chef at this restaurant is known for her adorable dog as well as her cooking! I read about her in many magazines and decided to come for dinner one evening
Fabulous wine, sake and the dumplings were delicious with a perfect soy
This adorable spot is one of my Soho favorites!
as we entered, we were told a 20 min wait
so we waited at the bar
a drink or two went by, but as we slowly realized our wait had become an hour from the promised 20 min, the server noted upon our inquiry that they recognized and remembered us and would seat us soon- rolling eye look- matched by a tone protesting the uncouth annoyance
still

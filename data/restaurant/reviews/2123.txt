Soggy on top, and charred on the bottom, this nightmare dish tasted overwhelmingly of egg with the oddest aftertaste that can only be described as 'fishy
'   I dare you to try this for yourself
On your way out, take notice of all the uneaten brown lumps left by your fellow patrons
My friends and I did, and we're still laughing in complete disbelief over this experience
Chez le chef is definitely unusual
from the handlebar mustache of Frederic to the pink bagels
It sells an incredibly wide selection of foods, which mostly hit but sometimes miss
(some things are a little fussy for my palate)
Something to watch out for in summer is the gazpacho
I haven't had better in NYC
The pastry is heavenly, the service divine
This not-too-pricey little shop will give you a beautiful latte and cookie for $5-6, and much better than Starbucks to be sure
Chef Frederic is very nice, informative and friendly
It's a great place to brunch
A very pleasant owner, who patiently told me all of the specials and items on the prix fixe over the phone, but that's the only nice thing I can say about Chez le Chef
Well, I suppose their bread was also good
However the entree was truly awful
My wife and I ordered the Thai Beef Stew to go
She tried a bite, spat it out, took another bite elsewhere, and spat it out
I took only one bite
Then the entire $17
50 entree went straight into the garbage can
We declined even to feed it to our dog
Hi
The bakery items are wonderful and the food is amazing (but pricey!) This is definitely a place worth coming to
I have the advantage of working within two blocks of this place and have seen the quality of the food improve significantly
I get the feeling it is under new management who happens to be a superb chef/baker
The plain bagels are oh so perfect, dense and slightly salty
Makes for a perfect bagel sandwich
Sandwiches come with a side salad
I highly recommend the German potato salad
They also have two cases full of baked goods
You won't be able to resist the chocolate chip cookies
Overall, this place is a gem of a lunch spot
A couple blocks from the trendy Park Avenue restaurants, La Posada is a comfy spot with old-style california mexican food
The people at the next table are more likely to be Baruch students on a date than model wannabes
It's kitchy, but fun
There is no fancy fried sushi on the menu--just basic enchiladas, burrito, taco and beans
For take-out, La Posada is head and shoulders above the other neighborhood burrito places
The drinks are cheap, too
This place is a great little fast food Mexican joint
Everything is fresh and flavorful and the service is friendly and helpful
Just as good delivered or eaten at the small no-frills restaurant
The Scene Meals at Hangawi have a ritualistic air--pass through the heavy wooden doors at the entrance and a soft-spoken host gently asks you to remove your shoes
A minimalistic, serene dining space waits beyond, where patrons sit on cushions at small, sunken rows of wooden tables
The Food Ordering a la carte from the all-vegetarian menu can be fun, but don't be surprised if Hangawi's atmosphere makes your decision-making faculties melt away
The solution? Opt for the spectacular Emperor's Meal, a multi-course tasting menu loaded with velvet-textured pumpkin soup, mesclun greens sparked by a simple but savory sesame-soy vinaigrette, crispy sauteed tofu noodles and steamboat soup, a heady clear-broth crock of cabbage, carrots, watercress, mushrooms, walnuts, dates and cherries
We were impressed with the authentic decor and elegance of the restaurant - floor seating, but interesting enough has a well/pit under the table if sitting in the lotus position is not your cup of tea!  The Emperors meal was an adventure - at times bland, but the presentation, colors and flatware made us raise an eyebrow each time the server came with the next course
What disappointed us was the *2 person minimum* for the emperor meals which are $37
50 per person - which limits you from experimenting with something else on the menu
Overall very original !
We were looking forward to try this restaurant after reading good reviews on both citysearch and zagat
Unfortunately, it was a total disappointment for us, not sure if this is authentic Korean cuisine
Every dish was unnecessarily sweet, especially the sesame porridge
It tasted salty and sweet at the same time
The Emperor's Roll was nothing but a few bland pancakes wrapped with shreds of steamed carrots, zucchini and pepper, dipped in a sweet mustard sauce
This is probably the worst meal that we had in New York
The food is good
The porridges are a must as a side dish
Very tasty
I enjoyed the experience of trying different items, but the main dishes are not extra special
The atmosphere is serene
The staff is pleasant but sometimes difficult to understand
I like to drink a variety of teas, but I've had some here that are really weird that I would avoid next time
The price can run high
Despite this, I have been there several times and have enjoyed it, although moreso the first time (many years ago)
There's nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about
The atmosphere is serene, comfortable, quiet
Decent vegetarian food (although my mongolian hot pot was tasteless, everything else was pretty decent
I particularly liked my moji red bean dessert-- YUM)
If you're curious about vegetarian in a relatively upscale nice atmosphere, this is a good place to visit
I'm not sure what the problem for the last couple of reviewers was but we had a great experience
The service was attentive, polite, and unhurried, the food was subtle but creative and thoughtful, and the decor was just gorgeous
As for price, it's not cheap-cheap but this is hardly an expensive restaurant
Most main dishes are in the $15 dollar range - and well worth it
We had early reservations (pre-theater) and had no trouble getting a table
I would suggest that if this place gets crowded later, come early and relax
Go to Hangawi for vegetarian fare and beautiful ambience
Service is OK, food is pricey
The service were horrible
I had to get them 2 or 3 times just to order my food
Even worst, after we got our entrees, we had to ask 4 times for 4 bowls of rice and got it 20 minutes later when we were nearly done with our dish
If I paid that much on food, it better be great food and great service
The food was average, and do I have to say more about the service?
After arriving at Hagawi with no reservation at around 7:00 we asked for a table
When they said they had one we asked if they would need the table for a reservation that night because we didn't want to rush
That's all they did to us
Considering we ordered appetizers, main courses, and dessert you would think that we could enjoy each
The main courses came out half way through the appetizers and they proceded to ask us if we wanted the check several times starting just as they removed the dishes from our table
We even asked why we were being rushed when we asked if they need the table and got no answer
The food was good, but not better than we've had in many other places
I wouldn't subject myself to this place again
My mom came to NYC from Korea and so I took her to this restaurant cuz I thought she might enjoy a nice Korean meal
When we got there however, none of the servers spoke Korean
That was really strange, but when we looked around the restaurant, we realized there were no Koreans eating in the restaurant either
This restaurant is great for vegetarians and the ambience is very serene, but it's really catered towards Non-Koreans and would probably be more interesting for tourists
Hangawi has lost its charms
I frequent Hangawi about a year back and had always enjoyed my meals
Sadly, during a recent visit, I felt that it is no longer able to live up to its charm
The biggest complaint here is its food

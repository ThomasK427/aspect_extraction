The tables are so close together that it is impossible to have a private conversation
The food was not tasteful at all! It is very expensive for what they offer
The wine list is also not very good
There is nothing special about this place
very simple, but pricey
My boyfriend and I did not even have dessert because we wanted to get out of there as fast as possible
I just wonder how Michelin could give a good rating to this restaurant
There are many good places to go in Manhattan, so dont waste your money and your time
I have just written a review that was deemed too long to put in here
Suffice to say everything is bad about this place
From the inept service to the surly maitre d' to the stupid experimentation
The prawn cous cous is one of the worst dishes I've ever eaten
You need to learn from someone like Heston Blumenthal about experimentation before blindly doing stuff to food
You could excuse the kitchen which clearly has passion and tries if the service was good but the maitre d' was simply horrible and seemed to blame us for the fact that she sat us 45 mins later than our table was booked for
A joke from start to finish and definitely a case of emporer's new clothes from some of the reviews I've read
The food was inedible
They are trying way too hard to make tech food that winds up tasting disgusting
The music, service and food was bad
I wanted to send my food back and am sorry that I didn't do so
Don't waste your time-there are too many excellent alternatives
A friend ordered the pork belly and it was 4 strips of fat that went uneaten
My order of riblette turned out to be a VERY fatty piece of sausage
The portions are also mini-me sized
They also kept six parties waiting even though there were many open tables
This fad has lasted too long and should end now
My partner and I have dined all over
Nantucket to Napa
Chicago to New York
This was the best meal ever
We went for the 10 course tasting menu paired with wine
The price was exceptionally reasonable for the amount of food and wine we recieved
not to mention, we were able to talk with Willie(head chef) afterwards and have a tour of the kitchen
The cocktails were just as creative as the food
I wanted to try them all
Willie is a mad scientist in the kitchen
so is Sam (pastry chef)
Everyone was pleasant and I would go back anytime
I also recommend Moto in Chicago for a simular experience
OK enough wth the small portion thing! People, go see Super Size Me and get real
My god!! The portions are perfect size and the food is unbelievable and unique
OK maybe you won't have to unbutton your pants after the meal but, you know what??? You shouldn't be eating that much anyway
I had been wanting to try WD-50 for a while and went for the first time recently
I had read a lot of mixed reviews so I was a bit skeptical, but it was great
As others have said, the portions are a bit small but a three course meal is enough to fill you up
The appetizers and desserts were the best part (the banana dessert was amazing)
The couple at the next table had the $95 tasting menu that I wish I had ordered
I will definitely go back here
It's nice to be able to eat great food in a relaxed setting that's not stuffy like so many other places
There are too many reviews stating that the portions are small at WD 50
Alas I think these were written by people unaware of what a proper portion of food should be after eating at Applebees too often
The food is fantastic, and three courses is a perfect size meal
The ambience and service splendid, and having budgeted for a grand night, I was pleasantly surprised at the cost come the end of the meal
If you know who Ferran Adria or his restaurant Il Bulli then you should immediately go to WD-50 and see his American equivalent Wylie Dufresne
If you know nothing about Adria then it will be impossible to understand what WD-50 is trying to achieve with their Tasting Menu and dishes
WD-50 is not about satisfying your hunger as much as it is about satiating your food curiosity
Food and flavors are broken down to their essence and reconstructed in a thoughtful, artistic way that challenges any and all ideas you had about the ingredients
The food portions were so small, that this is the first time that I reviewed a restaurant
If I could type with a size 4 font, that would be appropriate to convey the lack of food served
For example, the scallop entree consisted of 4 scallops and a forkful of potatoes
Making matters worse, the cost was higher than most fineer restaurants and the service was slow
Also, we happened to think the food was not tasty
But, we understand that taste can be subjective
But, lack of food served is not subjective
After having an appetizer, drinks, entree and full desert- we THEN had pizza and garlic knots at a pizzeria to fill our stomachs
To each his/her own, but I'm not really sure who would like this restaurant
Maybe an anorexic person with money and time to burn
Convinced by all the accolades about the tasting menu - a few friends and I tried it out
At $95pp for 11 courses, we thought we were gettign a great deal
However, the rumors are true
The portions are all the size of an amuse bouche
Normally the portions get a bit bigger for the signature tasting dishes
Not the case here
Everything was about 2 bites
Ok - so we didn't leave stuffed - but the food was also SOOOOOO salty
I'd chalk it up to a bad sous chef - but WD was in the house
Off night? I hope so
Also - who ends a meal with curry dusted nuts? That what we were served after dessert
Talk about leaving with a bad taste in our mouths
We asked for something sweet - Supposedly there was not one bit of chocolate in the restaurant
Hmmmmm
This meal was amazing
I love to challenge my palatte and this meal certainly did just that
While all the food was quality enough to stand on its own, Mr
Dufresne's creative combinations and inventive presentations made the meal standout
The venison tartare with edamame ice cream was a great way to start the meal, but the ocean trout was most impressive- an explosion of flavors, textures, and colors
For dessert, the parsnip cake with coconut ice cream is a must, but I would probably skip the strawberries with parmesean ice cream, as it was not as exciting
I liked the unpretentious ambience, and the servers were knowledgable and polite
I definitely will be returning soon to try the tasting menu
My boyfriend and I both went for the tasting menu with matched wine pairing (roughly 160 each) with an additional cocktail beforehand
We asked the chef if it was possible to have two different tasting menus, to which he was quick and eager to comply
The food, while in very small portions even by NYC standards, was definetly the most creative and thoughtfully prepared meals I have ever eaten
The service was impeccable, the ambience understated but cozy, and by the end of the meal, I knew I had chosen the best birthday destination
Mr
Dufresne's father came over at the end of the meal to thank us for our service, which I thought to be an awfully fine gesture
The desserts prepared by Sam Mason were also quite delectable
If you can afford it, and like to challenge your palate, this is a place for you
Presentation - great, very artistic
Atmosphere - cozy enough
Food - duck appetizer was great, as was the beef and ocean trout main courses
The milk chocolate parfait with orange was okay

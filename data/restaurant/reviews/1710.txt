Also, their house (carrot vinegrette) dressing simply cannot be beat
It's so prized that they won't even give it to you in a take-out order (because they're afraid someone will figure out the 'secret' recipe)
This place is great for first dates, kids, artists and people from all walks of life
The food is not amazing, but the atmosphere is
Everytime I go there I feel utterly at home and don't want to leave
It seriously has to be one of the hippest places in town
I went to Yaffa because of all the good things I had heard about this place
Prices are cheap and the place has some character but the food is pretty bad - just not worth eating
Too bad, because the place seemed to have potential
This place rocks- open 24/7- can't beat it- and they have the best carrot ginger dressing in town
For $10 Yaffa can't beat
Cheap, fast, good food in a comfy and interesting setting
The inside of Yaffa is decorated as if Boy George exploded inside
The huge and beautiful summer garden is every visitor's must see
The staff is not eager to please but more ready to entertain
A motley crew of actors and artists, provide great laughs and hijinks
Just don't bother these future divas with any of your needy behavior, they won't stand for it and will give you more attitude than you can handle
Ecclectically decorated, dark and snug (inside), with a beautiful garden in the back, this is an ideal (relatively inexpensive) getaway from the outside world
Their sunshine burger platter rocks, as does the rock shrimp pasta plate
Oh, and they give out Yaffa condoms upon check out, in case you were so inspired you needed to take your date and treat him/her like the hot piece of meat s/he is
But the only meat you can hope of having at Yaffa's is the winged or the finned type
Main reason why one would go to Yaffa is the decor and the staff
The decor is funky, out of place and somewhat corny
But for some mystical reason it works together as one of the greatest decors in NYC
The staff, about as colorful and odd as the decor, is enthusiastic and always makes up for a great show
It's watching a bunch of actors, musicians and artists put down their show
I love the way the waiter covered with tatoos and the eastern european runner serve us
It's a show you don't want to miss
Staff can be rude at times, especially when it is busy
The food, on the other hand, is only alright
It's st
marks quality
Go figure
At least it's cheap and the variety is good
Overall, the Yaffa Cafe is definetly worth the trip to the east village!
I have been to Yaffa about four times now, and I'd highly recommend it! It's open 24 hours and has a really cool ambience - funky leopard seats, cool lamps, and a gorgeous, peaceful little garden to sit in outside
The food is very affordable and has been delcious everytime
I'd never had carrot salad dressing before - but now I always choose it
It's something a little different, and really delicious! I've had some great chicken dishes with veggies and rice on the side
A delcious noodle, veggie, and shrimp dish, spinach crepes, salads
All good
They have an extensive CD collection here too, and they are always playing some good music while you eat too!
I can't believe this place gets such good reviews
The food here is at best very very ordinary but more often just bad
The staff are unfriendly
The only thing that it has going for it is the decor and the garden which I grant is nice
This place is cool
Funky mixed decorations, nice back garden, good food, good prices
It's a great place to meet with friends for dinner, or for a date! Definately worth the try!
Perfect for pulling the all nighter
Waitstaff is usually intimidating but also quick to get you the delicious food they offer
No matter what you order, use the carrot dressing on the salad liberally, it's worth the trip
I liked the hummos platter, the brie sandwich, and about 20 other things on the menu (if they still have the chocolate cake you need to get it)
Sit outside if you can, it's pure refuge from the noise of the lower east side
One thing -- watch your bags while you're there, I saw more than one pickpocketing attempt happen in the dining area
If you're looking to be bemused, try their delivery, which seems to be available only on every other full moon
cool joint, Yaffa
cheap, good food, nice garden and relaxing
good place to bring a date on the way out, or better yet on the home--grab a free condom when you pay your bill
Go during the day - it is a place out of the city: you'll be, during your stay, at a quiet patio cut-off from the bustling city at a peaceful sun-lit garden
Food's decent
My friend took me to the Yaffa Cafe when I visited him in NYC and I was just blown away: not only was the food cheap and yummy, but whoever decorated this place has an open invitation to come to my room any time and see what he/she can do
I didn't know so much kitsch could be stuffed into such a small space
I swear, that Elvis painting was thisclose to coming home with me (along with the complimentary condom I got at checkout)
Even though the space was a little cramped, it was such a fun environment to be in
I can't wait to go back!
The Scene Luca Lounge is home to one of the leafiest and largest patios in Manhattan, which makes it popular hang out for diners, and drinkers, alike
Inside, the decor is homey, with comfy chairs, tin ceilings and funky oil lamps
The vibe is casual, as is the service
The Food While the Italian menu is simple, the food is fresh and authentic enough to raise the standard of late-night snacking
Hearty appetizers include garlicky tomato bruschetta; a platter of prosciutto with dry-aged sausage; and baby spinach salad with shaved pecorino cheese
The signature homemade pizzettes are ample; the quattro stagioni (topped with prosciutto, artichokes, olives and mushrooms) is particularly stellar and pairs perfectly with almost any bottle off the all-Italian wine list
Mangia, baby
We live in the East Village and have walked away from most of our dining experiences with at least one good thing to say, however, there was nothing good about our dinner at Luca Lounge
It took forever to seat us even though the restaurant was almost completely empty, then we had to ask to be waited on, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 30 minutes to get our salad and then even more time to get our pizza and then our bill
You get the idea
We ended up asking three waitresses for plates, bill and change afterwards
We will never go back and don't recommend you do either
love the place
crazy on weekends if you want to go for dinner go during the week or early on the weekends
toooooooo busy and it will take away from your experience
in-less you want to drink then its perfect
I have lived in the east village for years and Luca Lounge always looks like a tempting spot b/c of the garden and decor
DONT BE FOOLED!!!!! Luca Lounge is quite possibly the worst restaurant I have ever been to
Every time I try to give it a chance I am disappointed with the food and service
The last time I went, my lasagna was served completely burned and worst of all, I literally had to carry my half finished plate inside after our server told us the garden was closing and we had to move
The staff is casually rude and lacks any kind of tact
A friend of mine had a party of 50 booked one month in advance, and after having confirmed the reservation, went in the week before to check things out
The wait person proceeded to tell him that not only was his reservation not on the books, but the entire restaurant was booked that night
The manager refused to come out to discuss and was apparently hiding in the back, leaving the wait person to make ridiculous excuses
Unless you want irresponsibly rude service do not go to Luca Lounge
My fiance and I go here about once a week, and love it! The staff is a bunch of cute, friendly NYC girls, and I'm surprised to see so much negetive stuff here
Maybe people are expecting something ritzy, or don't know the policies in advance(every restaraunt has em!) Or have never been to an east village hang out before
This is a very cool, laid back place with shabby chic decor in the back, and candle lit nooks, and really attractive young clientelle
It gets crazy busy like any other bar on the weekends, so don't go there on a busy night if your looking for a quiete dinner party or fine dining service
In short, if you love the east village and the cool, atmoshere that goes with it, you'll love this place for the tasty italian food, rockin music(weekends) candle lit enviornment, and thouroughly new york staff
I really had a great time at Luca Lounge, I have been with my best friend, we enjoyed the fresh food and the cosy terrasse with candles everywhere
The chicken salad is amazing !!! The best time to go is during the week to enjoy the terrasse early in the evening
I go to Luca Lounge quite often because it is my favourite place to hang out with friends
I was badly hurt when I read all those postings because I have always been stronlgy pleased with the delicious Italian cuisine, with the friendly service of the staff, and the awesome coctails they offer

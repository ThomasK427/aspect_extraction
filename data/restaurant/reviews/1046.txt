Entrees cost $18-$26
Appetizers $7-$15
We went as 2 couples
Ordered 4 appetizers 4 entrees + 2 desserts
Final cost $90 per couple (includes tip)
Entrees were good
Generous portions
Great little space, great food, great fun
Went at 9pm mid week and were seated right away
Service was friendly fun and knowledgeable
Nice little wine list with some inexpensive gems
Our party of 4 ordered only appetizers (about 6 of them) and made a wonderful meal out of it
Would definitely recommend
It's almost never a good bet to try a restaurant within the first few months of operation
However, I am happy to say that August was an exception to that rule
The menu is simple and rustic, and trully runs the gammut of flavor and texture
Try the hare and squid
Saturday night, waited about 30 minutes for a table at 9pm -- not bad
VERY good service -- glasses were always refilled, plates cleared, etc
Food was *deliciousl* It's billed as regional cuisine, ie, rustic food from across Europe
I had the yummy rabbit, friend had the top-notch bass
Wine cheese were marvelous, they comped us 2 glasses of dessert wine
I'd happily go back
Dyin to return for brunch! Warm, sincere energy -- great date place
August is a wonderful little gem with delicious food and nice atmosphere
We were greated welcomingly and seated right away
The atmosphere was comfy yet elegant
The food ranges from rich and sumptuous (the beef), to delicate and delightful (the seabass with fennel and oranges)
The food wasn't overwhelming, but was very tasty, and the space wasn't overcrowded or obnoxious - the waiters and waitresses were attentive and helpful, but not obtrusive
Overall, a wonderful dinner
We ususally don't like to try a new restaurant within its first month, but needed a last minute dining spot
The restaurant is very small and we finally managed counter space at the small bar in the back
The restuarant doesn't take reservations, but I was told at 8pm the wait for 4 people would not be long at all
We finally sat at 9:30 having been told the crowd was very slow moving
When we finally sat we didn't get our wine for 15 minutes because they ran out of glasses
Then, they forgot one of our appetizers, though once reminded they brought to us at no charge
The food was actually quite good and very satisfying
They need to iron out a few kinks in the service, but we would definitely give it a second chance
August feels like it has been great local standby for years
The food is very rustic European peasant food, not just Italian as Citysearch has it listed
August seems to be going for a mixed menu of regionally specific dishes from all over Europe and somehow it all comes together perfectly
Service could use a little work, but then again when you are at August it kind of feels like your at a party in the loft kitchen of one of the NYC great chefs on his night off having fun
I also love that they play great rock and roll, both classic and new instead of the eurotrash lounge
Go check out August soon and build a relationship with the owner Jason before it gets to busy and you can't get a table, well at least until the back garden opens
The Scene White walls, bright wood and exposed brick give a homey feeling to this snug East Village trattoria
Although the restaurant is carefully assembled and managed, the low prices and informal vibe have a mellowing effect
Service is warm and competent, if occasionally rushed
The Food The regional Italian cooking is joyfully simple
Pillowy fried dough rectangles partner well with an array of salami as a starter; an intensely flavored appetizer of chicken livers in balsamic reduction is also delicious
Pastas can be little marvels of texture, exemplified by a basic yet remarkably good ricotta-filled ravioli with sage butter, while tagliatelle fails to thrive in a prosaic meat ragu
Meat and fish entrees hold their own: Plump, creamy boiled cotechino (pork) sausage is full-flavored yet delicate; filet mignon, tossed with fresh rosemary, is juicy and satisfying; a stew packed with shrimp, clams, fish and croutons is rich and ruddy
Went here for a friend's birthday--the staff was extremely accomodating: reservations for 10, kept her b-day cake cold, and then brought it out with candles
I'm a vegan---but all of my friends love their cheese, meats, seafood and they thoroughly enjoyed their meals
Cute and Cozy
The food was not particularly noteworthy, but I was happy to be there
Most entrees are $15 or less
The portions are huge -- neither my date or I could finish our portions
There's no bar, so expect to give your name and then have a drink at Voon next door or possibly at Manhatta
The decor is country-house charm, though there's one unfinished wall (of exposed brick), which needs some covering
The tables are too close together, but the crowd noise manages to create some privacy
Went there for my birthday with my girlfriend and loved every minute of it
The food is great and well priced
The atmosphere is perfect for a date - felt very comfortable
It can get a little cramped since the place is pretty small, otherwise it's extremely cosy
Remember, they don't accept credit cards
This is a small Italian place in Noho
It does not take reservations however there is usually not a long wait as they try and get you in and out as fast as possible
Prices are very reasonable however they do not accept credit cards
The food is good although the portions are a little small
The staff is pretty friendly
You eat very well at Bianca
It's a wonderful dining experience and perfect for a date (very romatic)
Small place, very cozy - down to the tables
Portions are healthy and prices are very reasonable
Great Filet Mignon and gnochhi with salami
Service is friendly
We plan to return soon
Definitely a favorite for all the right reasons
I have now had dinner at Bianca three times and my experience just keeps getting better and better
From the kind staff who managed to store all of our work bags and even 2 suitcases to the unbelievable meals, I could not be any happier
As an appetizer, you must start with the puff triangles with cheese - it is the best! I can't wait to bring more friends to Bianca
It is a perfect spot any night of the week
And there is a terrific wine bar next store for an after dinner drink
The food and service were excellent and not intrusive, and the atmosphere was ideal for an intimate and comfortable meal
The crowd was friendly and reflected the best of real New York City
Thank you
Went there with a friend last week, and was delightfully surprised by the host's humor as he sat us
We were a bit chatty so it took us a while to decide what to order, but when we made it abundantly clear we were ready (closed the menu, looked around for our waiter) he was slammed from the recent filling of the space
We ended up placing our order with the host about 10 minutes later than we'd have liked to, but the host was, again, extremely kind
The food came quickly and my chicken was delicious, just seemed like they were a little understaffed for the night, or had a lot of people come in right after 8:00
Other than that, really cute, charming restaurant with a surprisingly good menu!
I visited Bianca with my wife an two kids
What an amazing time! The food was great
The service was fantastic eventhough we were not the typical village crowd
I will certainly go back soon when I'm in town
Highly recommended!
What a shame
The food's good, the prices are reasonable, the decor is pleasant
But the service ruined the experience
I ordered the spaghetti and asked for mozzarella on top

The waiter, the same one, was much less attentive when I was a couple vs
with 3 other women
My meal, also the same, (the seabass) was missing the crabcake dumplings on the second try
The place is beautiful, but the noise level is unbelievable
It was so hard to hold a conversation with all the noise surrounding us
I think if you are 3 or more, and get a four-top table the experience will be great
But, the two seaters are less appealing
I think it's a very nice place, but lose the attitude and keep the food consistent and it will thrive
Ate at A Voce for the first time last night and will DEFINITELY be back
The food here is INCREDIBLE! For appetizers, order the sheep's milk ricotta (out of this world), the duck meatballs, and whatever addition to the menu they are featuring that evening (we had the rare ahi tuna - melts in your mouth!) Dessert was great too - try the donuts and tiramisu
Overall an excellent experience, highly recommended
The food does not waver at any point in the meal
Duck meatballs were outstanding
The desserts weren't as polished as the apps/entrees
One criticism is that the service needs a little bit more polishing
A bottle of pinot bianco was ordered for the table for a toast and the waitress finished the bottle by the fourth person
We definitely going to get a second bottle anyways but def
didn't want to wait the 10 minutes it took to get it
Rookie mistake
Overall, the food shines here, wait till they perfect it, it will be a very good choice
We tried A Voce, though we don't like to try very new restaurants, on Sat
night
It was excellent
The hostess and hosts at the front were super nice
The waiters were professional and friendly
The food is the star here
Terrific pasta w/ ramps speck (ham), and the BEST white tuna from Hawaii entree that I have ever eaten! Great desserts and excellent wine
The only, and I am reaching for something that is not stellar to say: the crowd is a bit older, I am 40, and the crowd was late 50's and 60's
Could've been the night
Still a great eating experience! GO!
We came in from CT, and after seeing a great Sweeney Todd, limoed it down to A Voce
The hostess was the mostest; our waiter Tim very attentive, helpful and kind
Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming to our obviously touristy group of 6
The back white linguine with shrimp was fantastic, as were the salads
Bonus: Bobby Flay and Stephanie March sat at the table next to ours and were also having a good time
Tasteful decor (nice chairs!), cool bathrooms, pretty window-side table, delicious cocktails, celebrity scenery and a joyously noisy roomful of diners all added to the wonderful experience! We loved it
Thank you Tim!
A close friend and I dined here 1 week after opening
It was already running like a well oiled machine
Our experience was spectacular
The warm ambiance is perfect for a business dinner, or a romantic evening
The service was superb, and our sommelier recommended an amazing wine! The food was wonderful as well! We started with the carne cruda and mama's homemade ravioli - both good, but the ravioli trumped the beef
Then I had the veal, it was fall-apart tender and full of flavor
My friend had the scallops - our waiter told us that he didn't recommend them from the seafood options - we probably should have listened (but pretnot bad for a non-recommended dish)
We shared a warm chocolate moltent cake for dessert
okay, but it doesn't touch Del Frisco's
I'd say skip dessert and splurge on a great bottle of wine! I'll be back!
Came from Philly to eat here for my birthday
My wife and i sat at the bar and loved everything
Duck meat balls, octopus, Lamb pasta, all great
Morimoto, Anita Lo were having dinner
Go before you can't get in
Service great, grapa perfect
After a long delay, a Voce is finally open
Restaurant is simply decorated and comfortable
Large windows give an open and airy feeling
In the warmer days expect to see their large sidewalk dining area
One advice is if you want to have a quiet dining experience then ask for a table in the main dining room instead of the entrance/bar area
Food is based on traditional Italian recipes simply prepared yet creates tasty combinations
Octopus is a good dish to start with
Chicken Cacciatore was a popular dish with among the diners
Definitly get the potato side dish, one of the best
Traditional Tiramisu with a twist is a nice way of finishing your Italian experice
Wine list offers a nice selection with an average price of $45
00 a bottle
An addition to the new lower Madison Restaurant Row
It had only open for 5 days when we visited last night but you wouldn't know it
The service is knowldgeable and always there when you need them without being overbearing, space is large but stylish very comfortable but the real highlight is the food
A simple Winter Insalata was much more than the sum of its parts, octopus was superbly tender, veal sweetbreads were done very nicely and the chicken cacciatore was perfect - I don't know how you make chicken taste that good
We live nearby and whist this won't beccome an every day destination, as it is a little pricey, we'll certainly return
I've been to a couple of the Grand Sichuan restaurants in the city (the one on 9th and the other on 2nd)
The food has always been good, especially some of the more authentic Sichuan dishes
The price has also been reasonable
This one is a notch nicer than the others - the decor is a touch more modern and the menu is also expanded to include some Hunan dishes
Each of the restaurants is a bit different, but this one may be my favorite
Super nice servers, terrific mexican food, and we saw Mike Meyers there
Cool vibe overall
What else can you ask for? Highly recommended
Yes the place is small ( 4 tables?)
The guacamole ($5)needed some salt
I had the chicken chilaquiles ($8?)which was good but needed a little something
The drinks ($10) were STRONG!
Saw a celeb stop in
Overall, not bad but not great either
My freinds didn't like it but i think it's cuz they're accustomed to mexican tasting more like taco bell (no offense to my friends or taco bell)
I'm an Upper East Side resident and my Lower East Side friend brought me to El Bocadito for the first time last night
I have to say, it was well worth the trip - I'd definitely go back
The mole enchiladas (I had steak in there) were amazing -- chocolate and spice at the same time - awesome
The chicken nachos are the best I've had anywhere - seriously, they're that good
Great margaritas and not expensive
And we had a flight of three awesome tequilas for like 12 bucks I think
The service was great, too
There was a little wait to get seated (we sat at the bar near the chef) but it was not that long (15 min?) and totally worth it
It must be good if we had to wait on a Tuesday!
My roommate loved this place so we went to check it out and frankly, I just don't get it
The food ranged from average to below average: chicken chilaquiles came with about 4 tiny bite-sized pieces of chicken floating in a bowl of salsa verde, the chile relleno was decent, but was lukewarm and accompanied by a cold pile of rice mush, and the guacamole was fine, but nowadays even Chipotle makes great guacamole so I don't consider that to be a selling point
The lowpoint of dinner came when our waitress asked us to change tables midway through our meal so a larger party could squeeze in
We agreed and did we see any freebie desserts or drinks for our trouble? Nope
I guess the dearth of good Mexican joints in New York has people convinced that El Bocadito is a real find, but for anyone who's eaten great Mexican food outside the city, this place is a big fat letdown
Those of us living in Chinatown/LES are forever scoping out what is new and different

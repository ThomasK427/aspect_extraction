joy!
this spot has alot of charm especially when the outdoor cafe opens in the spring
great value for high quality italian food
Finally- a new restaurant that lived up to the hype
The space is charming with old wood tables and soft light
The staff is exceptionally friendly though the service did drag a bit and the wine we ordered was out of stock (sort of odd for a new restaurant) but the cheerful interactions of the employees made the experieced relaxed
And the food was worth any obstacle
The bruschetta was incredibly fresh, the salads were filled with tasty produce
The entrees were perfect - and the portion sizes were appropriate - not too big or small
Can't wait to go back!
This Pippa chef is something else
I had a squash soup to die for and the risotto
well, just don't find the words except
I want more!
I went to Poetessa this weekend, after eating at East Post for the past 4 years
Unfortunately, I will never visit this restaurant again
While the new chef is extremely disappointing, the horrible service is is even worse
I used to love East Post precisely because the service was so good, the food was great, even all of my vegetarian friends loved it
This time, the waiting time from when we entered the restaurant to receiving our entree was over 2 hours!!! We had to ask repeatedly for bread and water, imagine my embarrassment after gushing about East Post, my guests asked if we had entered a prison
When after 2 hours we did ask for our entrees, the waiter and busboy were both extremely rude
One of my guests ordered the gnocchi with a pesto sauce instead of marinara (which appeared elsewhere on the menu) and was refused unconditionally
This is my favorite korean restaurant out of ALL the korean restaurants in both NYC and LA!!! It has all the elements of a great neighborhood restaurant; somewhere you want to go everyday after a long day of work and just linger over a great meal
Best of all, you don't come out smelling like bbq
In response to the previous poster, it's actually not any more expensive then any other korean place, and all the great things about it make it much more worth it to go
This place has a modern, fresh ambience
But what's really great about this place is the fantastic wine list, which is 2 pages long, and the selection is excellent
The meat was fresh and of very high quality
Try the sirloin kalbi or the wine samgyupsal
Although this place is slightly more expensive than the other Korean joints on the strip, it's worth it
This is my new favorite Korean restaurant in town
The Scene Two separate rooms offer widely divergent atmospheres: The dim, cozy corner space offers calm and warmth, but next door in the takeout shop, confusion reigns
Cooks and counter help scramble to keep up with orders and stay out of the others' way, sometimes promising slices to walk-ins without having any to sell
The Food Despite borrowing the name of legendary pizza man Dominic De Marco, owner of Midwood pizza mecca Di Fara, the good pizza here has little in common with the ethereal pies of the original
Round and square pizzas alike are topped with a bright, basil-specked sauce, dotted with fresh and solid mozzarellas, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with grana padana after baking
But while the square pie gets approving nods for its pleasantly pillowy crust, the round pies' crust is a bit too flimsy for the wet cheese atop
go there and see for yourself i had a great time thanks to not listening to people say its not worth it i'll be back
I went here after reading about it at Di Fara's
De Marco, the nephew of the Ave J
Mr, De Marco, is a genial Roman who came out to inquire about the pizza and briefly chatted afterward
We had a very good medium-thin crust round pie with extra cheese, which, although not as good as Di Fara's New York pies, can hold up as one of the top 10 I've had in the city
What really makes this place great was the sexy, intimate, but unpretentious atmosphere (dimmed lights, exposed brick, candlelight, empty not desolate), which I did not expect (and the takeout counter next door, for convenience)
I shall return
Been here 3 times, (because near my job) and every time I have went I was diappointed
Last time was the worst, the service was real bad and terrrible pizza
The slice I bought was burnt and the pizza maker says that the way it is
WHAT? I demanded my money back and would tell everyone never to bother the walk to this out of the way place
This is New York, but this place is not New York Pizza
This place is great
I have gone to a few Happy Hours there and have eaten the pizza too many times to count
It just keeps getting better and better
The pizza is a concert of aromatic spices, gooey cheese and a wonderful sauce that always tastes fresh - not to mention the crunchy crust
I also love the Chicken Parm! I am headed there this Thursday for another Happy Hour and Karaoke
can't wait!
DeMarco's has been sort of a weekly stop for us in the last couple of months
But it seems that while they claim to be improving upon their pizza, its quality has gone down hill
The staff's familiar faces have been replaced by a younger, less knowledgable, less friendly group of BTers
I hope that the charm that we once knew can be recaptured
I've been there a bunch of times since De Marco's first opened and the pizza gets better each time I go
Their sauce is incredible, the crust is amazing and it's simply the best pizza in NYC
You must try it!
While the salad was very good and the waiter was pleasant, the pizza was swimming in oil
I couldn't eat it
How bad can pizza be? It depends how much you like your heart
Both the takeout and the restaurant suck
The service is absolutely terrible
The takeout store need some experienced staff who know how to cut a pie
If you are going to charge almost $3 (without toppings) make sure whoever is cutting the pizza makes the slices even - I saw a guy get the smallest slice i've ever seen all because the pie wasn't cut evenly
They tend to burn the base of the pizza too - we were given slices with black carbon on the bottom - ok if you like eating coal!!
Nice start to a new place
Give them a chance to work out the kinks
I'm sure things will run a lot better in a few months!
I couldn't believe it when i first heard the De Marco family was opening in Manhattan
I got there as soon as i could, and even with much anticipation, it was incredible! The De Marco's clearly know how to make a slice of pizza
The quality is unmatched-- the sauce is just the right mix of spices and sweetness
This pizza is out of this world!!!
I have been there twice now and the pizza is just awesome
It's far and away the best pizza in NYC
It's not quite as perfect as the Brooklyn store yet but it's pretty darn close
If you haven't tried it yet, you must!
While the staff were quite pleasant, our server was clueless and unexperienced
I was shocked at how soggy and oily this pizza was-I couldn't even eat a whole slice! Very dissapointing--and they were out of 90% of their bottled wines
Who in their right mind is going to get a $180 bottle of wine with their pizza??
If you are a pizza lover, then look no further for the best pizza in all of NYC
They use the freshest, top quality ingredients and make every pie with tender loving care
It's not a place to go if you are in a hurry, but it is definitely worth the wait
I'm drooling just thinking about it!!
I looooooooove Kush! It's *my* place
The owner is super friendly and the wait-staff is excellent
All the food is great--brunch, lunch, and dinner
The atmosphere is casual and comfortable
I especially enjoy the back patio now that the weather is warm--during the day or in the evening
You have to try the hang-over soup on the brunch menu!  This is a great place to go with friends, on a date, with a group or by yourself
They do take-out too! It ALL good


Cool little hidden restaurant
The staff was real friendly and the food was good
The service was a little slow but the friendly staff made up for it
A must try is the Sorrel Martini and the chicken gizzard appetizer
I never had chicken gizzards before but I like to eat so I can give them a thumbs up

Ate at the bar and started with an amazing bowl of french onion soup with 3 cheeses (3!) and then chose 5 different cheeses from the menu of well over 100 - the wine list is extensive and impressive, I tried 3 different whites and each were perfect for the massive cheese intake
I noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and food - my thoughts and suggestions are: eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and Artisanal's reputation is based on the cheese, get the CHEESE and not the steak or whatever
Go with what they are known for!
the cheese is the reason to go here
The decor is nice and the service can be a bit spotty, but the fondue and cheeses are the best in the city
i went recently for the first (and most likely last) time
i was annoyed that i had to wait even though i'd made a reservation
it was unbelievably hot inside, and i'm the type who is usually cold in most rooms
our waiter wasn't unattentive, but it took him a long time to get to us in order to take our order and get us our check
i had asked for a special dessert since i was there celebrating someone's birthday, but it never showed
i was actually relieved, cause by then i was ready to leave
paid about $60/person with a drink, appetizer, entree, tax and less than average tip
the food was nothing special, though the fondue was good
had heard very good things about this restaurant from people i respect
last night was hot outside but air-conditioning in the restaurant was very sub-standard (i
e
hot and sticky)
food was just so-so
in some cases, worse
my appetizer of escargot in biscuits and sauce was so salty it was inedible
dover sole (at $38) had lost its texture and some of its taste
restaurant was noisy and tables were too close together
if you REALLY like cheese, are willing to put up with everything else and pay (not counting tip) $180 for two, then this is your place
otherwise, stay clear
The food (cheese) was quite good, however, the a/c was not
It was so uncomfortably warm
We complained 3 times and there was no improvement
Eating while so uncomfortable was miserable! What made matters worse was the lack of concern
Not once did anyone apologize until we were out the door
way too little, way too late!!! Sorry but there are too many resturants in NY to put up with such poor service
I recently dined at Artisanal because I was given a gift certificate
I went having read the other reviews posted on City Search
I have to say that overall I was not impressed
The decor was nice, but the restaurant with it's high ceiling and tiled floor was very noisey
The music was also strange and not appropriate for the restaurant
Our appetizers were good, but not worth the price of an entree at another restaurant
My dover sole was good, but my friend's lamb was all bone and no meat
Most importantly, the service was impersonal and rushed
Although our water glass was never left empty, the numerous servers felt more like guards hurrying us out of there
Bottom line: There are so many good french restaurants
Don't go to the one that is over priced, has bad service, and not that great food
- t's like a dressed up Pastis
If you go for anything then go for the cheese - the Fondu is good as are the finishing cheese selections
Fromage is the winner here - everything else it truly valueless
We tried the escargo - it was ok but Blue Ribbon's on Sullivan is supreme
I had the Steak Pom Frittes - for 23$
I was disappointed
It tasted fine - but I would have expected a small filet instead of 7 micro portion - pre cut slices
That and it came with ketchup - since when does steak pom frittes come with ketchup? It's like the chef telling me on the side that the steak is utter junk right from the get go
- service - despite other reviewers claims - was suprisingly good -
There's nothing magical about this place, which is how I feel after dining there last night
While the cheese was outstanding, the entrees, drinks and service were lacking
While I enjoy French food, there are certain things that I'm unaware of in various dishes
The French waiter seemed annoyed that I was asking so many questions and offered little to no assistance in helping me choose the right dish
The atmosphere is that of a steak house, very loud, not romantic, with a very ordinay decor
I would recommend if you like cheese, but not for the $140 bill that comes with an average meal
I go out to eat in NYC quite often, so I was eager to try Artisanal
One word: Overrated
Don't get me wrong, I love cheese (their specialty)
but there wasn't even that much cheese on their menu
Maybe I was just expecting too much, but I honestly didn't see what all the fromage hoopla is about
I would say everything my group tried could best be described as eh
and for the prices, eh just doesn't cut it
As for the service, don't get me started
If you want your servers attention, bring your flares
there is a slight chance someone might respond to that
Maybe being exposed to so much cheese for prolonged periods of time has an adverse effect on one's personality
just a theory
My advice, skip Artisanal
if your in the mood for cheese, grab some Cracker Barrel for $3
95 at Gristede's and call it a day
While the atmosphere and food at artisanal was pleasant and tasty respectively, the service was inexusable for a place of that - possibly self appointed - caliber
He was rude, impatient and not even all that informed
However the rest of the staff was great and we loved the cheese expert!  FYI: the mesculin salad may as well have been the salad mix from Costco with bad dressing
Our Service was actually good up until the end of the meal, when the waitress obviously took a turn for the worse and decided that throwing our dessert menus down on the table would be an effective way to get a tip
food was great - but you have to put up with less than par service
Needless to say - we had no dessert and her tip was below standard
Apparently the bar staff of Artisanal did not receive the memo on the poor economy and the importance of retaining customers, ruining an excellent food experience
Instead, the customer service at the bar is deemed less important than discussions of personal lives with the other maybe-I-can-make-it-in-a-C-grade-movie-someday staff
I guess when your life can be described by Donald Judd sculptures - untitled and minimal - the concept of service is tough to grasp
Hopefully management will give them more time to do so in the near future and replace these malcontents with the congenial and fun cheese cave personnel
I like this joint in Murray Hill
The food was great and the service was fine
I had Sunday Bunch on Easter Sunday and I really enjoyed the experience
The Fried Bone Marrow was cute even though it was kinda fatty
I paid $20
03, pretty reasonable considering it's a French Restaurant
Don't forget about the cheese!
Be forewarned, if you don't like cheese then this is not your place
Excellent fondue with an onsite cheese expert who will graciously choose a wine to go with your cheese or even select a plate of cheese to suit your palate
I can't imagine going there too often but enjoyable experience
Typical French bistro decor
Artisanal is a great restaurant! I love french bistros and this is sure to be one of my favorites
They have a great and affordable wine list and amazing cheeses, but they also have a wonderful bistro menu
I had french onion soup and steak frites and I enjoyed both dishes
I shared a cheese plate and profiteroles for dessert and both were delicious
The price was very reasonable and the decor is great
I have to say that I prefer Balthazar a little b/c I think the food is a bit better, but I will definitely be going back to Artisanal
It is not as loud or crowded as Balthazar either and that is a plus
and went on a Wednesday night expecting the worst

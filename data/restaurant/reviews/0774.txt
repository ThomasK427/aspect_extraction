A pleasure
I went with my friends and the food was horrible
The waiters were so rude
For many times and for many reasons this place deserve to be the best
Always the food is exellent, very well prepered and presented
The grilled calamari are the best you can ever find, also the codfish in polenta crost is an wonderful find, for dessert try an amasing panna cotta
I am always pleased there with a warm, personal and a care e service, not easy to find it in these days in NYC
All the best to BASSO EST
Pund for pound, this is currently my favorite Italian in NY
Reasonable prices, great food (try the maccheroni alla chitarra with lamb rag), and the service by the very zealous waiter will bring a smile to your face
Basso Est knows how to give diners a great time, and that a meal is an event
You MUST check out this restaurant
I made reservations, mentioning it was my boyfriend's birthday
The place is one of those small, intimate places that you can only find in New York
When we arrived, we were warmly greeted and brought a tasty free appetizer of bruschetta
Alex (who seemed to be in charge of everyone) was an amazing host
He made sure we were well-fed and our glasses were full
I recommend the grilled calamari to start, and, for entrees, the papardelle or the lamb chops
When our scrumptious chocolate crepes came out, Alex had included a candle and he, the staff, and the entire restaurant sang Happy Birthday
I couldn't have been more pleased, especially when the check came out
A bottle of wine, appetizer, two entrees, two cafe lattes, and dessert for under $200 in NYC?? Now I KNOW you want to check it out!!
I went on a Thursday night and it was almost full, but not at all crowded
It was quiet enough for conversing without having to raise your voice and we had plenty of room
The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful and the bussers were attentive, not at all overbearing
The BUCATINI ALL'AMATRICIANA is amazing, and very reasonably priced! We will definitely be back
This place is small and they pack tables in here
which could be the only downside
If you are on a date, avoid the ones by the bathroom or back by the kitchen b/c people will run by you all the time and you won't have that 'alone' feeling
Service was alright
The waiter was shmoozin other clients so someone else took our order
They all were friendly
The place was a bit loud as others have stated
And you can hear the music through the walls of orchard bar next door
Food was decent, the special of ravioli with red peppers was very good
I had reservations at 10pm on a Friday and ended up waiting about 15 mins for a table
Place was empty by the time I left around midnite
As an Italian living in New York for many years, I'm often asked where to go to eat good Italian
As I mostly eat at an extremely high level at home with family, I could never recommend anywhere, until now
Chef Paolo Catini serves up the freshest, tastiest, and most authentic Italian cuisine I have ever had in New York
I highly recommend any of the antipasto or pasta specials, the wine list is well-chosen, reasonable, and all Italian
The staff is efficient, fun, and really seem to be enjoying themselves
In short, if you want to have Italian, and don't mind going a bit out of your way, run here as soon as possible and enjoy some of the best food outside of Rome
Nice cozy place, very friendly service
Came with my girlfriend, loved this place immediately
Great setup
Food is delicious, look like artwork
Started with grilled calamari as apetizer
Bucatini pasta with bacon- one of my favorites--lots of meat sauce, another one is Fettuccine with portobello mushroom
Dessert is tasty but not overly sweet(which is good)-crepes in chocolate
Everything was to our liking, very tasty
If you want great Italian food, nice atmosphere, this is the place
authentic wonderful food in the village
the home made raviolis were awesome, the service impeccable and all of this from a tiny bistro on orchard
i live in restaurants so i know, this is good stuff :) try a drink with every course
Apart from the outstanding service at both the bar and the table, this small gem deserves all the priase it has received in recent months
Take a friend, a small group, or a date but be sure to call ahead - people are starting to hear about this place from their friends!
This was one of the best Italian restaurants I have been in
Although the place itself is kinda small, the service makes up for it
Me and my date came w/o reservations and not only were we promptly seated, a table was taken from the back and placed there JUST FOR US! WOW! The food was good, the price is decent, and overall it's a place where you can have a romantic night and enjoy Italian food
My wife and I travel to NYC a few times a year
We had tried to find an Italian restaurant that had great food and ambience
We tried a couple of expensive and a couple of moderate places with food and ambience that I could easily get at local Italian chain restaurant
I read about Basso EST hear on Citysearch and gave it a try
I honestly could not say enough
The wide boar Ragout dish is excellent, Service is superb, and the location althought well away from where we typically stay, is well worth the trip
We now go there every time we visit NYC
The price is overly reasonable for the total experience!
The restaurant is small cozy, the Mussel w/tomatoe sauce the grilled calamari appertizers were great
For entries we ordered the Cappelini Angel Hair pasta seafood the linguenie with shrimps
Both were delicous the tiramisu in a wine glass were so tasty
The service was outstanding
Alex, the manager was very nice pleasant
for the price, wow, it's worth every penny
Highly recommended to anyone visiting New York
Good Italian spot, but should raise the bar on the food before some newcomers challenge its standings
Good service, small space, oaky wine list make this an average bet in the Lower East side
I read the reviews here and thought I'd try it out
The place is great
Good portion for it's price
The dishes were above average
The people who worked there were extra-friendly and very helpful
All in all, it was a pleasant experience
I would definitely head back for seconds
thirds
Went to this restaurant on a Saturday night and had the most delightful time
The food was great, the ambience was fantastic, and the service was outstanding
Great for a date if you want a romantic place without the schmaltz
Also not bad on the pocketbook
Tons of great Italian wines for a reasonable price
I think this is a real hidden jewel
I don't know why the place was almost empty until 8PM, but the food and service were perfect for the price
You might find it overrated, but you won't find a better culinary experience anywhere else in NYC for the same price
What do you say about a place you can't find any fault with whatsoever? I'm headed back, and SOON! Not once but twice did I arrived here attempting another pricier and certainly more pretentious establishment nearby
Visiting for Sunday brunch and for dinner, both experiences were so positive Basso Est is no longer my backup - it's my first choice!
We came for the all-you-can-drink booze-a-thon, and stayed for the delicious food charmin service! This tiny place has a FANTASTIC $11 brunch which includes bloody marys or mimosas to your heart's content
Yum! The marys are superb: strong, fresh-tasting, and spicy
My eggs benedict was excellent, with a thick tarragon(?) hollandaise
Yum! All my companions were happy and tipsy when we walked out
Great bread strawberry jam while you wait, too! The Italian waiters were absolute gems
I can't wait to try their dinner menu

I frequently bring clients and friends to Shane's
The wood paneling is charming, the bathroom clean and the food is very tasty
There's something for the veggie lover and omnivore
It has a selection of coffees and teas, as well as beer and wine  IF YOU FREQUENTLY EAT out it's a winner
Shane's includes live entertainment certain evenings
I cannot believe how bad the servers can be here
I used to be a waitress (and not the best either) so I'm pretty forgiving, but this place can just be horrible
They used to have a decent staff, but recently it's been atrocious
The last time we came they screwed up our order 3 times (and we weren't ordering anything that's not on the menu!), we had to get up to put milk and sugar in our coffee because by the third time we asked in 20 minutes we gave up
And, the waiter then told us it was the kitchen's fault, not his! Give me a break! The food is very good, but I wouldn't go unless you don't care what you get, how long you're there or how cold your food is by the time you get to eat it
I like this place - it's a little hideaway with down home caribbean food
I had the BBQ chicken and Mac and cheese and I was STUFFED! It's a bit overprice but with the changing neighborhood, they will be around for a while
I enjoyed the friendly people and laid back atmosphere
If you want some real island food, stop on by Islands!
I find the food inconsistent
The barbacued chicken is sometimes good and other times comes with a watery sauce which is worse than canned
Most dishes are warmed by microwave as is the fried chicken which has a fish odor from the oil in which it is fried
Dishes are overpriced relative to quality and neighborhood competition
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING
don't come here if you want fast food
the food is SLOW-COOKED AND ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! best jerk chicken and mac and cheese
the ambience is great
and the staff there is soooooooooo friendly and helpful
like real down-home style
we waited about an hour for our food but it was worth every second
and the prices were soooo good! i'll be back again and again and again!
Islands is a teeny tiny place with a counter and 3 stools, and a ridiculously steep little staircase leading to a small but cozy 2nd floor with about 4-5 tables
The food is simple, and simply good
Subtle and interesting tastes in the main dishes and the accompanying sides
Everything has that homemade quality, but a cut above
The staff is friendly and welcoming, and neighborhood regulars drop in to say hi
Air America can be heard on the radio much of the time
A definite find across the street from the newly fabulously renovated Brooklyn Museum
They have the best ice tea until they moved next door
Everything looks almost the same
I love it when I ordered the Shrimp and pineapple fried rice! They serve the dish in a pineapple
I never knew there was fried ice cream before I saw it in their menu!
This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant in the Flushing area, but then they bought over the Malaysian place next door and merged
I still go often, but the prices went up a little and the service is even slower now that they're always full during dinner hours
The seating arrangment isn't the most practical because people get in the way of each other a lot, but the food makes it worth it
The thai iced tea is my favorite, and the thai food is great
I don't know if other places make it this way, but the ice cream was encased in a fried dough, kind of like a zeppole
Intriguingly yummy
Noodle soup and a shared dessert came out to $8-9 per person, including tax and tip
Not bad
Gum fung has great hong kong style dim sum with all the standard dishes and some specialty plates as well
It's also very conveniently located right across the street from the large municipal parking structure! During the week there is no wait, and the food is still fresh
There is a larger selection on the weekends but the wait was not so bad compared to some places in manhattan (15-20 minutes
) The dining room is large and spacious
great for groups!
Food does not taste fresh as it doesn't taste homemade
It taste as though they bought the food elsewhere and serve it at their restaurant
It's a cozy little dining room with a small bar, but it makes you feel like your right inside Mama Conti's dining room
And the small quarters is actually deceivingly big, allowing a table of 8 in the corner to enjoy the pleasures of Conti's! The Italian family run restaurant is just like going to a real Italian family dinner! It's cozy and the whole staff is so very fun and friendly that you'll want to stay the weekend! And the food is made with so much love and care
The bread is freshly baked and the food from the tender duckling to the juicy steak will make your mouth water for more! And if you're lucky Mama will come out with a plateful of her homemade Italian cookies! Mangia!
This is a great neighborhood restaurant where the waiters and waitresses wear red berets (as in the name of the restaurant)
They serve large portions and their beef dishes are delicious
They also have delivery, if you live in the neighborhood
This is the second restaurant
The original is in the 80s
This place has great indian chinese food
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal
Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny
Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash! Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself
Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food
There are no negatives to speak of
In Short Live lobsters wriggle in a tank inside this seafood emporium, where nautical-patterned booths and colorful, fish-shaped tables in the bar area add subdued touches of whimsy to the room's classy dark wood accents
The menu can be downright decadent, with starters of artichoke lobster dip, seafood fondue, and crab-stuffed mushrooms
Entrees feature lighter, grilled fare like mahi-mahi and North Atlantic sea scallops, along with signature lobster dishes, snow crab legs, and jumbo fried shrimp platters
Sorry but you gotta love this chain
the place reminds me of being a kid
But the fried- been frozen for days- shrimps an old time fave
The food
I love it, as mediocre as it can get, but just YUMMY! inexpensive and near by
The oversized pina coladas are just the needed combo to have an SPF day
LOVE ME SOME RED LOBSTER! even after going to real crab-houses
I still dont give up RL
Look no further than Chikurin for fresh sushi, only $2
50/roll and $1/piece (for most) all day and every day
My favorites are the Alaskan roll and Spicy Tuna roll
The Beef Teriyaki I got once had a hard texture though
The Miso soup is pretty good
The prices are reasonable but they don't have a sushi lunch
Their answer to that was the get the sushi appetizer with a side of salad or soup
The staff is friendly
Delivery usually within 1/2 hr and I live one train station away
Before La Terraza, it used to be Tutta Pasta where the service was horrible but the prices were great for the location
The restaurant has a nice outside area where you may have dinner or just go in for a drink on a nice summer evening
It is also dedicated to it's customers but with the economy not doing well, this restaurant makes it difficult for couples and families to visit
This restaurant has good food and great drinks but the prices are for a 4 star restaurant
The restaurant is in Queens with much competition in the area such as Pasta D'Giorno and Porto fino where prices are not as high and have remainded the same for quite awhile
The food wasnt bad and the service was fast but not as friendly as it could have been
The location is ideal being close to movies and other things to do
If you are planning a small dinner with family or looking for a place to eat when not going on your first date, it's not a bad choice
Take your credit card because it is a little on the Pricey side for the food and service that you get
They make some of the best Tom Kha Gai
All the food is excellent and the atmosphere is nice

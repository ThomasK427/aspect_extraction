A restaurant this unfriendly, unproffesional and classless should never be visited
To make matters worse the food was cold and undercooked
I think it is the worst restaurant in Manhattan
Dropped in for lunch before and thorougly enjoyed it
This time (Sunday evening 2/9) was not memorable
Food ok, but not outstanding
No one orders off the menu, which is part of the fun her
However, specials (e
g
, swordfish, chicken marsala, et al, were not)
Wine over priced for what tasted like standard industrial swill jug stuff
I dicovered Rocco at my pals Bday party a couple of years ago
And then returning months later, I was shocked to find the staff remembered my name and treated my party like gold
I was hooked
The food is the best and the staff doesnt get any more authentic
Carlos will recommend the fish that was just caught from the sea, or perhaps a nica veal in a burgandy sauce
don't forget the red potatoes
I would have to say the calamari and mussels are to die for
it's true
I killed my friend Joe for his plate! If you are from out of town, please do not come
you will be hooked and probably come back as much as me and take my seat
Rocco is the best
The Best!! No questions asked
After stumbling upon this quaint spot downtown, we were treated to the best italian food we have ever had
The service was wonderful, not rushed, and ready with excellent recommendations
It's really the food that is the stand-out however
Pure and simple italian food with deep flavor and wonderful presentation
You will love this cute hole in the wall!
This is one of the few real Italian restaurants left in Manhattan
It looks and feels like Little Italy (though it isn't there) circa 1900
It reminds me a bit of the restaurant in The Godfather, very old times kind of place
The menu is limited, but you won't be disapointed with what you order, and the service is very friendly
Try the fried calamari when they have it
In Short The menu offers chicken and lamb shish kebabs, but most folks are lining up at the takeaway window, or waiting for the handful of inside tables, for the doner kebabs
With the requisite tomatoes, onions, yogurt sauce, plus a generous portion of lemon-garlic beef, this stuffed pita is a meal in itself
The falafel--available a la carte or in a pita sandwich--rounds out the menu, along with hummus, spanakopita and other traditional Turkish foods
I am Turkish and was craving for something familiar today, so on my lunch break thought I give this place a try
Well let me tell you; eating area is not very sanitary, the place needs a serious renovation, the looks not so appettizing, even with the famous people pictures on the wall! The doner pita portion is huge for $5
00, (ofcourse I am a petite lady but I am sure it's plenty for anyone), the taste is fine but the meat was kinda undercooked, which is not so pleasant for Doner sandwich
Baklava was just not right, but I am very particular when it comes to that! Ohh yeah and mine was burned to top that
And one last thing why do Spanish guys run a Turkish restaurant? There are no Turks left to do the job? Nothing against the Spanish and there is no rule that Turkish food has to be prepared by Turks but just confusing
No wonder Americans mix us all up, :) Spanish guys serving Arabic food in a Turkish Kebab joint (I mean common'now! TABULI, FELAFEL is not Turkish)!!!
I have been here only once
Ordered a lamb dish
It came to me bloody, I mean it was barely cooked
When I asked for it to be well done, the service person gave me an attitude
i was very suprised, its not like he told me that they cook their dishes rare in default
Man, this place rocks
For reasons beyond me, this gyro is better than any other hole in the wall in the city
Do yourself a favor and fork over 4
25 to the nicest gyro men in Manhattan and get yourself a LOADED sandwhich
On your next trip
go for the falafel, good eats, great price
The Sunday night bellydance show is amazing! There are three dancers, and live music, and everyone gets up to dance (if they want to)
There is a $20 minimum, but no charge for the show
I've been there a few times, and always enjoyed it
They don't take reservations, though, so you have to get there by 8:00 to get a good table
It's a really fun evening, and the lead musician is a hoot (even if you are not used to bellydancing music)!
My boyfriend and I were a bit under the influence and this was the only restaurant in the vicinity (on a Friday night around 8pm) with any people inside
We were incredibly disapointed
The mussels were inedible and the pasta was drowned in garlic
I can only assume to cover up the only average taste
My boyfriend had the hamburger
who knew you could get a bad hamburger in NYC? Try one of the many other restaurants in the neighborhood
This place was BAD!
No matter what I do or who I'm with, I always end up at Le Figaro for coffee and dessert in Greenwich Village
The broody interior and the unique wall pasted with the French newspaper, Le Figaro, has the weathered charm I don't think of as deliberate
It's always been a Village staple that I'm glad is still around
Sipping the specialty coffees (my favorite is the Valencia with the Orange Liquer) and having the chocolate mousse or mud pie gives me a rich indulgence but it's cozy
The appeal never changes even if I'm still there at 3 AM and it feels true that the city doesn't sleep at all
The Scene  Weekends bring bedlam to Arturo's, as crowds surge in, packing three deep near the bar, sucking down Budweisers while waiting for tables to open up
Comfort is decidedly not a factor in the Arturo's experience--once patrons escape the bottleneck near the bar, they're shoehorned into a miniscule dining room
The laughably overpriced melange of paint-by-numbers fruit still lifes that adorns the walls is the stuff of legend--regulars claim never to have seen a single one sell
The Food Generously-sized brick-oven pies, with properly smoky thin crusts, fresh sauce and a greaseless layer of fresh mozzarella
Arturo's also offers an impressive array of homestyle Italian favorites, from pastas to steamed mussels
I was taken there by friends that are 'locals'
Now each time I come to NYC I insist we go to this place - it's the best pizza in town and the best pizza I know! On my last visit we managed to secure a place outside
I greatly enjoyed the people watching, thought the staff was great and the peperoni and the mushroom pizzas did not dissapoint
Didn't see John Favreau, though!
Thin, very crispy but still foldable, nice taste of char without being burnt
All in all I'd say it's was the prototype NY pizza crust
The toppings were unremarkable
All in all though a good pizza
The service was slow and the waiter definitely gave the impression that this he really hated his job
The people watching sitting outside was fine, the inside is pure old NY kitsch, and I'd eat there again - although I wouldn't make a trip to do it
Some better toppings and I might
Arturo's has the genuine feel of old Greenwich Village, with its time worn nooks, primitive art, and staff that seems to have worked there since the 1930s
It's a lovely atmosphere, rarely found in the City these days
Unfortunately the food is not that great
Pizza crusts are a little too firm and the toppings don't seem much different from your corner pizza place
With gems such as Lil' Frankie's, Franny's, Joe's, et al
, this brick oven doesn't do much for these pies
The apps are just terrible piles of cheap ingredients, oily cheese and iceberg lettuce
So come for the atmosphere only
By far, the best pizza in the city
The crust is perfection
I have tried all the best pizza in the city
and none can come close to Arturo's
Any guests that visit me here in manhattan, will be having Arturo's for dinner
JUST GET A PIE

wed 9pm
seated quickly without reservations although place was quite full
table was cramped, packed in right next to the adjacent tables
loud
a bit too bright to be romantic
my capellini thing with italian sausages and zucchini was good
al dente
homemade type noodles
my wife's fusilli and pancetta was too salty for her to finish
the glass of house white was ok
Good food and friendly service (amazing value)
It's a shame the owner/manager/hostess is an evil witch
She ruined an otherwise pleasant dining experience
Went to this lovely restaurant twice in one week--that's how much I loved the food
Each time the waitstaff was sooooo accomadating and the food was quick and excellent
The price is incredible for what you get
5 diamond cuisne at a 2 diamond price
Took a bunch of business cards and gave them to everyone I know
Fresh pasta, tasty sauces, inexpensive dinner, what else can we ask for? It is simply delicious
Try the Pescatore or the pasta with walnuts
my co-workers introduced me to this great little italian trattoria in soho
the service is incredibly fast, and the food is excellent
my one gripe about the place would probably be the noise
it is rather small and fills up pretty quickly, so it can get rather loud
but other than that, it's a wonderful place for a romantic dinner
I went to Il Corallo for lunch with my sister, and what a pleasent surprise it was
The food was fresh and tasty, the service was just right, and the restaurant was cozy
Great place for a date that won't break your budget
Give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised
We get this delivered every Sunday, and have never been dissapointed
The mixed grill is so flavorful, the hummus is perfectly whipped with the right authetic spices, and the pita is really fresh and fluffy
It is exactly what it should be
I recommend this place
Do not miss the kube, morrocan cigars and the legendary hoomoos
In the heart of NY, there is a middle-eastern restaurant which brings the best taste of the orient into the city
Hagai, a cheerful yemenite-israeli, does magic
Found a great and cheap middle-eastern restaurant in the heart of SoHo
Very fresh food, large servings, and extremly friendly waitress
Loved my food ( has varities from Yememni to Lebanese to Israeli dishes)
The weekend special of Juhnoon bread is awesome
Humus is nice, but the koftas are the crowning peice here
I did not try other dishes, but will soon
BEATS ANY BRUNCH IN THE CITY HANDS DOWN
(heck, its healthier than eggs/bacon and potatoes!)
Fine Establishment which should be held at the highest regard
Great Humus, great mixed grill good appetizer salads, real thick fries, fresh falafel, fresh pita cheap
what else you want in a restaurant
Hands down, best falafel ever
I worked in the neighborhood for almost a year, and ate here at least once a week, every week
They have a nice variety of awesome isreali food, and everything is fresh and of great quality
The fluffy pita is the best around
The staff is friendly and efficient
Great for a quick bite--you won't be disappointed!
A rare dining bargain in the Soho vicinity
The atmosphere is plain and takeout-like, but the inexpensive Middle Eastern food has a tasty, hearty quality
Good weekend lunch option if you'd to skip some of the pricier brunches nearby
Went here July 13
Was seated at a booth in the back, near the kitchen
We had just received our drinks when a r-o-a-c-h the size of my thumb crawled up the arm of my boyfriend, who seated across from me
Utterly grossed out, he jumped up and tried to find it while I got a hold of the host and asked to be reseated (would have just left if I hadn't gotten my drink)
At first he was brusque and, bored/rude, asked what the problem was with where he sat us
I explained the vermin-crawling-on-my-boyfriend situation
Unstirred, he told me I didn't seat you; ask her, pointing to the hostess next to him
Only he HAD sat us, which he then realized moments later
At this point my boyfriend trapped the b-u-g beneath his messenger bag and managed to (a) squish it and (b) throw it out
Many children and yuppie onlookers in the packed dining room
Our fearless waitress ran into the kitchen for cover while this all played out
The couscous appetizer we were eventually served smelled strongly of acetone--obviously gone bad--I've made couscous salad before at home and it smells that way when it's turned
Not wanting to run the risk of complaining again, but not wanting to eat food that smelled strongly of Cutex nail polish remover, we sent it back
The host, while apologetic, proceeded to tell us that he tasted the salad we sent back and that it was the gorgonzola that probably smelled weird
I know what gorgonzola tastes/smells like, Thanks
The salad was bad
Finally, it was necessary to order a beer three times before it arrived
Though he comped us our drinks, I was disappointed during this visit
I've been there a half dozen times before and have generally enjoyed the food and service
But I don't think I'll be going back--not worth the time/money and distraction of looking at my sandaled feet constantly, expecting large vermin to crawl up my leg any moment
They need to exterminate there
i've only been here so far with my girlfriends and i love coming here
i think i've had the tuna salad, some sort of sandwich, the hummus platter, and the fried calamari
all were great! i love organic food
i haven't had dinner here yet but i'm surprised to hear other people say that the food was bland as usually in my experience, organic food is the most flavorful
anyway, this is one of my favorite spots to get a drink and a light snack with my girlfriends
I came here last night with a group of friends
The food was bland, everything seemed underseasoned
The service though was amazing
I would expect better food at the prices they were charging
Worst Food Ever
Dont Waste Time or Money!!!! The food is way too bland they use no type of seasons
This place SUCKS!!!
why this place is so crowded! I've been twice(to give it a second chance) and was a little let down
Honestly, the food is a bit bland and it seems that the food is prepared with little thought and care(wilted lettuce, cheese chunks too large for salad)
I really want to like it, but I just can't say that it's worth the price
The service is good, but in once case we waited over an hour for our food and we only ordered salad!
this place has a great brunch menu and everything i've tried has been delicious (and i've been back 3 times!)
the drinks and the food in general is all really reasonably priced, and the atmoshphere inside is very fun and lively or there's seating outside for perfect people-watching
definitely try it!
Whenever I have dinner plans with people I don't really know, I go here
Not too expensive, great atmosphere, food options for all sorts of diets
The bathroom is ridiculously tiny
The bread basket used to be better, but I always eat it up anyway

I would recommend this place for good food and service
In Short Founded in 1954, this ultracasual eatery (often with a drive-through) made its name with hamburgers cooked over flames and finished with the customer's choice of toppings
The signature sandwich has always been the Whopper, a quarter-pound burger with tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, ketchup, pickles and onions
The menu also features fish fillets and spicy chicken sandwiches, garden salads with fire-grilled shrimp and chicken, the breakfast "Croissan'wich," crispy onion rings and even veggie burgers
After standing in line for fifteen minutes to order, I again had to stand in line for 25 minutes in order to get my food
They got the order right, and the food was okay, but the service, and managerial design were beyond terrible
This wasn't fast food
The first time I ate at Johnny's was in 1987
My children now drive themselves to Johnny's
BTW I live in Bayside and have to cross the bridge to go there
The service is average, the wait at times can be monstrous, and waiting for pizza to finally arrive at your table can take an hour or more
Why do I keep going back? THE PIZZA IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I have tried to find pizza like it elsewhere but can't
I have tried most of the best and still think Johnny's is the best
This is by far the best then slice pizza in Westchester! Johnny's does not deliver
You are better off eating at the pizzeria because by the time you take it home the pie will be cold
Do not ask for extra toppings etc
because if you do you may get yelled at! But believe me this pizza is terrific
The slices are very thin so you will eat more than your usual amount
My children will be the 4th generation to eat Johnny's Pizza
The pizza will keep bringing you back
It is not like the pizza you see today where you eat two slices and you are full
You enjoy every bite of a Johnny's pizza
Made the same way since 1940 (they have to be doing something right)
If one can get past the notion of a difficult parking situation and a considerable wait standing in line at the doorway, this hidden pizzeria offers quite an incredible pie
Perhaps the previous reviewer was there on a bad night, but we have been here many times and have loved it each time
The Basil dressing always gets rave reviews and leaves diners wishing they could buy a bottle
The fried chicken is good and the red beans rice are great
Definitely use one of the 1,000 bottles of hot sauce placed throughout the restaurant, as that will only enhance the flavor
The portions are good sized and many times you will go home with extra food
I definitely recommend this Cajun gem in Mount Vernon
It may not be strictly traditional cajun, but it is still very good
Many nights they also have live music
This is possibly one of the worst restaurant meals I've ever eaten in my life
Even if you disregard the fact that the dishes were not even in the same neighborhood as authentic cajun food, the appetizer and entrees were bland, overcooked, made with old ingredients and no imagination
Even the mashed potatoes and gravy tasted like they were made in a high-school cafeteria
The food was appallingly bad, and to add insult to injury, the entrees were nearly $20 apiece!!! Why this place is popular is beyond me
The bar has a nice vibe and a good crowd, but stay away from the food at all costs
The food is great
The people are great
The music is great
The fact you can forget you're in NY is great
Go be great
Joe's is the BEST pizza in the world
Crust is perfect everytime, full of cheese (no missed spots); no need for toppings
I moved away 20 years ago and would never go home without getting a couple of slices everyday and taking one home if there is room in the trunk
Is the ultmimate pizza I've ever tasted!!!! Ittastes just like it did back in the day and I recommend very highly, any one to head over to try it!!!! And if you'd rather stay home, they deliver!!!!!
Joe's Pizzeria in Fleetwood is perfect
Hungry for a slice of that famous New York City pizza, but don't want to go all the way into the city to get it? Just drop in at Joe's Fleetwood Pizza in Mount Vernon for Big City Pizza in a small town restaurant
(And be sure to visit the bakery around the corner for dessert -- great Italian ices, too!)
The only thing I liked was the small portion of zuchinni
I ordered a pasta plate with crab meat worth 13
00 and all I got was a HEAP of spagetti and a miniscule amount of SHREDDED crab meat
I thought I would be getting crab MEAT chunks not something that resembeled shredded cheese
The spagetti tasted like they soaked it in pure ocean water and it smelled bad
My husband could have bough a better sandwhich elsewhere
The waitstaff consisted of one woman and she acted like she didn't have to work
It took 2 managers to sit us and get us going
It's not that big of a resturant! The bottom line is this place is HIGHLY not recommended
OH one more thing
we paid 8
00 for 2 drinks each, guess they need to make their $ somehow!
Great location to have coffee and dessert with friends and family
Try their great authentic portuguese desserts - pateis de nata, pudim flan - just to name a few and their great coffees as well
Very responsibly priced and friendly wait staff
No one is ever rushed out of the door
If you're looking for a sweet sensation, go to Cafe Porto
the portuguese cream filled canoli is a dream
oh, and the pastries are good too!
We just went to Tombolino's last night for dinner and it was amazing! We started with the Manicotti (which just melts in your mouth!) and some Linguini Carbonara (the linguini was fresh and the sauce was flavorful but not too heavy); then we had the Filet Of Sole Francese (really great!) and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (excellent! I loved it even though I'm not a huge fan of cordon bleu ordinarily); then we finished with the chocolate-caramel mousse pyramid which was the perfect ending to the meal
The food is top notch - flavorful, good portions, but doesn't stuff you to the point of feeling bloated or anything
The facts that the staff is so attentive, the ambiance is romantic, and the Friday night entertainment's voice is very smooth were just a bonus! Overall, I say A+!
This is really a great looking place
The food is good, the bartenders great and the drafts superb
It can get VERY crowded on the weekends and every other Thursday night (NYC workers paydays)
A great mix of girls, Irish, cops and locals
Worth the trip north of the city line
I'm not quite sure why Rory's is in the restaurant section
It does have good food, but it's really a bar/pub
The giant square bar takes up half the place
It's a great place to go to have a beer and meet people
Especially nice, unpretentious, working people
They have nights for teachers and nurses and nannies
This place is a great bar and it's huge
Great for B-days or for any occasion
I have been going here for 17 years and it keeps getting better with age, resonably priced with great service and amazing food
We have celebrated many family occasions here! It's always a must when we have company in town and don't want to head to the city for the night
Fantastic good and amazing service! You totally feel like family and they are willing to meet your every want (I order things not even on the menu and my very picky sister always gets exactly what she likes)
There is plenty of parking! It is a small restaurant, so there may be a wait
we usually call ahead, but we've had more than 12 people show up for dinner with no problems! Enjoy!!!
This place has just about everything on the menu lovely whote linen on the tables
The service is quick very good
From Cheese fries, Fish chips to salad steak, this place is reasonably priced a great place to take out-of-towners as an alternate to stinky Applebees blocks away
OK
so the place is a bit pricey not too true to the authentic japan style of serving taste
But the staff is friendly the food is good ( if you like ameri/jap )
Many americans don't like the traditional style for good purpose (taste)
If they've never been to Nippon (japan) tasted the difference they wouldn't know
There you have 2 types ameri/jap just japanese
This restaurant like all others in NY don't have the japanese taste
But I have found that this restaurant is frequented by some japanese locals I've seen shoppping @ Meidi Daido

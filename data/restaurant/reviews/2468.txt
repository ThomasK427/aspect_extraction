Highly recommanded!
The food was excellent!! The service was good and I had a great time
I look forward to eating there again!
They have quite good chinese food at very decent prices
Recommend!
Fast and reliable delivery and above average food
Definitely recommended for a night at home
My noodle soup was lacking but my friend's orange bean curd was to die for!
The Scene Hundreds of photos of the owners' eponymous black lab Fred, alongside endless other canine-related bric-a-brac, cover the dining room and bar walls
It's a fun, casual place, full of brunching families and friends catching up over cheap bottles of wine
The college-aged servers should give lessons in their craft--they're friendly and efficient, even when sprinting through the dinner rush
The Food This is real (as opposed to retro) home cooking
The menu lacks a cohesive theme (fajitas, chicken parmesan, and fancy Stilton-apple salads are all available), and the kitchen isn't flawless, but portions are sized for leftovers
The food almost always hits the spot: Mom's crispy-topped, oniony meatloaf with real mashed potatoes, aged-cheddar mac-and-cheese, and garlicky linguine with chopped clams are favorites
Beef, turkey or veggie burgers come on oversized egg rolls, dripping with cheese and surrounded with greaseless fries
Though the place looked packed as we approached it on an overcast Sunday afternoon, the Lady Friend and I were seated almost immediately
It could have been the L(B)F's good looks but the waitstaff seemed genuinely interested in making everyone's experience there a good one
The Lady Friend got the French toast and I got an omelette, and we managed to eat everything before it started to rain
This was my first brunch experience, and I would do it again with the Lady Friend
A very nice place, with great food where the friendly staff gets to know neighborhood regulars
Fred's can get crowded on the weekends, but it's worth the (usually) short wait
The home-style menu with such comfort foods as meatloaf and spaghetti with meatballs are all excellent
The ample portions fill you up, but you'll want to save some room for the desserts - which are also ample and scrumptious
Overall a great place for a nice date or a night out with friends
Of all of the amazing places to eat Brunch on the UWS, Fred's definitely takes the cake
The Fred's French Toast is amazing!! The waitstaff and management are extremely friendly, collaborating in hanging a pictures of our two family dogs the day that my family was visiting
The atmosphere is warm and the food is delish!!! I'd recommend Fred's with two thumbs up!!
#1 spot on the UWS for a real meal with great service at affordable prices
How cool to see my favorite neighborhood spot in the Sunday NY Times Business section this weekend
They are obviously doing something right
It seems like the owners and management have not changed for years and I always see the same faces over and over
Greatest burgers and Mac -N- Cheese! A little too kid heavy at times but Fred's really has the dinner crowd, cafe and bar done right
If you haven't been there
RUN! You won't find a better overall place in the neighborhood
Cheers!
This place used to have great service
I think management has changed over the past year
The service is ok, food ok, and they just don't seem as friendly as they used to
And what happened to the cute bartender on Friday nights?
For years this has been my neighborhood restaruant
I have enjoyed going to Fred's for over 4 years
It has a wonderful atmosphere, and great food
I eat at the bar on Sunday nights
I have enjoyed, over the last few years the lively and insightful conversations with the bartender
He is no longer there, and will be missed
I would love to know the next bar he will tend, as I will follow him there
I live in Brooklyn and travel to Fred's almost every Friday night
The food is good and the atmosphere is even better
The bartender has been there for years and is always pleasant, and the waitstaff is attentive and nice
Fred's goes to show that waiters and waitresses can be efficient and good at their jobs and have good attitudes at the same time
I often think of trying some of the other NY hotspots on Friday nights, but I always end up where I know I'll get a good meal and great service
I also LOVE the dog pictures covering the walls
Everyone needs their neighborhood place and this is mine
I can alway count on fresh food, friendly service and a great atmosphere
The perfect cozy/romantic place on the UWS where the staff is friendly, the food is very good and reasonably priced
Best neighborhood hangout!
it's small and cozy
one of my favorite places to go for salads (love the shrimp and tomato salad--and the salad nicoise is also good) and burgers, pastas, etc
it's also great for brunch
unpretentious and neighorhoody
you can never really go wrong
good food, nice and relaxed vibe
sometimes on the weekends you have to wait for a table and it's a little cramped in the front bar area
but it's also comfortable, though a little like a yuppified frat house
Fred is a black Lab that flunked out ouf blind school and open a fabulous restaurant
Excellent homey food, unbelievably friendly accomodating staff
A must if you want a true feel of a great neighborhood!
Freds does basic fare very well
The service is always great, and the wait is never as long as it looks
People watching on Amsterdam is worth the often noisy outside seating
Its THE quintessential UWS pub
Creamy, yummy macaroni and cheese- just like from your childhood
If macaroni isn't your cup of tea, try the salmon or burgers- you can't go wrong
And the homemade mash potatoes are like grandma's
This is the no fail place for me
Love it and it never diappoints
Good Guinness on tap and the mac-n-cheese rocks
The Scene This Haru branch is a medium-sized room with a small sushi bar, decked out in dark blond wood that shows a few signs of wear and tear
Large windows look out onto a gritty stretch of Amsterdam Avenue
Service, though attentive, doesn't go much further than recommending the yellowtail
The Food The giant pieces of sushi here provide value in terms of quantity, though the fish is unremarkable
Usuzukuri, a fluke appetizer, is light and transparent, but sashimi ceviche is waterlogged
Enormous pieces of toro are bland, and filet mignon teriyaki is slightly tough
The special rainbow roll allows curious diners to sample a mix of flavors
Haru is consistently good
It can get crowded and loud though
The disco music is a bit loud, but I still come back for the fresh fish
The service is efficient and skinny(to squeeze between the tables)
I've only had one bad experience there when I ordered scallop sushi
It tasted bad
I went to send the other pieces of it back, and the waitress was insistant that it couldn't be bad b/c it was fresh from the shell
Nonetheless, it was bad
Overall, I'd recommend
I eat at this particular Haru's ALL of the time
I am addicted to their spicy titanic roll


which could be easily renamed to PRICY titantic roll, but it is still damn good
I prefer to go when it isn't so crowded (weekends, late lunches, or early dinners) but late at night is good as well, if you don't mind eating after 10 p
m I've found the service pretty good an attentive at least 90% of the time

The service however is what really distinguishes Elio's - it's absolutely awful
Steer well clear of this over-hyped pretender
Felt like I just snuck into the country club at this high-end east side italian
Clearly a gathering spot for the affluent in the area but worthy of their praises
Everthing was fresh and delicious
Waiters were helpful and friendly
A little cramped but the Old New York feel to the dining room makes it OK
Would even go back with the kids if I could get in and out before the rush
BY FAR THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD ON THE UES besides Scalinatella
Everything is DELICOUS
I promise you will be coming back for seconds
Had reservations here last night(was recommeded to my family and I by a friend)
First of all you have no clue where to go when you walk in and no one was helpful in pointing us in the right direction, then the host was as rude as he could be--said it would be at least 20 minutes and then told us to move out of the way, but there is no where to go because of the crowd
Needless to say we walked right out
I am sorry but there is no excuse for the rude treament we received and no food is good enough for that
I don't know who the staff thinks they are, but they need to learn a few lessons in manners!!
Never again will I order linguine with white clam sauce in a restaurant other than Elio's
Their's is simply the best
Fresh clams
Light
Flavorful
Fresh, perfectly cooked pasta
Heaven
And try the pounded veal chop
It can be crowded and noisey
But if you want mediocre Italian food and quiet, stay home
In Short Though the owner hails from Croatia, he salutes his Italian relatives with dishes like artichokes with melted cheese, veal with fresh tomatoes and capers, and spaghetti with seafood
The name Girasole (which means sunflower) also originates from Italy, and a painting of the namesake blossom hangs amid the evenly spaced posters decorating the walls
Upper East Side patrons, who know the employees by name, dine frequently and leisurely at the cloth-covered tables
I walked into this restaurant expecting someplace I'd been before, but my memory was a few blocks off
The manager was more than happy to put us down for a table for an hour later since the place was packed
Considering it was our mistake and should have planned ahead, we thought this was more than accommodating
So we grabbed a couple beers at a local pub and then headed back at our reservation time (8:30pm)
We were seated right away, three of the waiters walked by and complimented us on our wine choice (we brought in our own bottle) and the food was amazing
Overall, a very happy accident
The food was amazing, filling,and worth every penny
The service was ok but a little more casual than expected
I highly recommend the chicken with herbs and mushrooms
Nice creamy and thick tiramisu
Never have I encountered a manager so full of himself, and so uninterested in his customers
The service was terrible, and the only response he could come up with was to insult me and my family, and to tell us that he had been there for sixteen years
DO NOT GO HERE!!!
I was shocked to read the negative reviews, below
My husband and I adore this place -- for its friendly staff (and yes, they do have thick Italian accents; we think that's a GOOD thing!), the lovely (free) plates of cured meat and cheese they put out with the bread basket the instant you sit down, the sunny yellow decor, and most of all, for the food
The selections are simple and fresh, just like you'd find in Rome
Reservations are certainly helpful (hello, it's New York!), but the couple of times we've wandered in and had to wait, the maitre d gave us free glasses of chianti
We've brought our parents and friends (as many as 6 at a time), and everyone always enjoys Girasole
The prices aren't cheap, but for the UES they're truly not bad
I have never been treated so poorly by a wait staff and a manager in my entire life
When the service was a bit below par, I complained to the manager, who told me that he didn't care what I thought because he usually doesn't seat parties of two and that he has been in the business for twenty years
He was the rudest restaraunt manager I have ever met and if you have the option of eating anywhere else besides patronizing Girasole and giving them any business, I would reccomend doing so
These are a few adjectives to describe the owner/manager
DON'T GO HERE
The food was decent but the staff was completely out of it and the manager actually yelled at us when we complained! I would NEVER return even if they offered me a free meal
With all the restaurants in the city--pick another
Worst service, with an even more inappropriate manager! Tried to order, and the snappy, obnoxious waiter, who was difficult to understand thru his thick italian accent, could hardly be bothered and bristled when asked for more time to decide
Do not dine here, too much $$$ for nothing
Had to wait a bit even with reservation, there was no room to stand and wait as waiters ran by us
We were charged for an extra plate when we shared a salad
Overpriced with a bit of attitude
Although this restaurant was listed in all of our EATS and We Deliver magazines I had never ventured to it until recently
I was pleasantly surprised to find a small, cozy, inexpensive gem right in the neighborhood
The portions are large and reasonably priced
The food is tasty, has a large enough assortment to please everyone and is served by a single waiter/manager with a smile
The only draw back is that the place is sooo small that on a busy night you have no hope of getting seated
Check this one out!
The Scene Twenty-year-old Paola's is a trattoria in the classic sense: a family-operated spot that has a rustic feel and is intimately linked to its surroundings
This is the sort of place where regulars invent frequent reasons to come, though it's so casual no special occasion is required
On the first visit, service--invariably attentive--runs the gamut from hospitable to gregarious
The Food Sublime pastas, robust meats slow-braised to fall-apart tenderness, fresh-dredged seafood
Mozzarella is made to order, served as a warm, still-settling mound resembling soft dough left to rise
The largely homemade pastas achieve harmonic heights--witness a tangle of silky pappardelle in meaty duck ragu, and buttery trofie (a narrow twist) with pesto as coarse as whole-grain mustard
Seconds are uniformly great--stinco d'agnello and braised lamb shank are both tender and substantial
Seafood specials, such as grilled African tiger shrimp, run out rapidly, so be on the lookout
I went to Paola's for dinner last weekend with a friend
We both knew very little about the restaurant going in, so it was basically an experiment - and we enjoyed a truly exceptional meal
The front dining room was cozy and easy to have a conversation in, despite it becoming more and more packed as the evening went on
(Definitely make reservations!) Appetizers arrived quickly and were delicious, the main dishes were distinctive and memorable, and the desserts were scrumptious
Service was quick, helpful, and friendly throughout the meal
The wine list is extensive, as is the variety on the menu
Summing up, I have only great things to say about Paola's!
WE ARRIVED AT 6:OOPM SAT NITE
AND WERE PROMPTLY SEATED IN THE COMFORTABLE ,COZY BACK ROOM
WE WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE ITALIAN WINE LIST HAD A WONDERFUL SANGIOVESE RED FOR $35
THE 1/2 ORDER PRIMI PASTA DISHES BLEW US AWAY
TRY THE PAPPARDELLE WITH DUCK SAUCE OR THE LINGUINI BOLOGNESE, THE GRILLED CALAMARI COATED WITH CRISPY BREAD CRUMBS WAS WAS ALSO A WINNER
THE BRONZINI REMINDED ME THAT FISH DID NOT HAVE TO BE BORING
THE DEBONED CORNISH HEN WAS MOIST AND FLAVORFUL
FINALLY , THE RICOTTA CHEESE CAKE WITH AN INTENSELY FLAVORED DECAF ESPRESSO WAS A PERFECT FINALE
THE SERVICE WAS CIVILIZED INFORMATIVE;WE NEVER FELT RUSHED , EVEN THOUGH PATRONS WERE WAITING TO BE SEATED
BY THE TIME WE FINISHED
WHAT A GREAT FIND WHICH IS SOMEWHAT UNDERATED BY ZAGAT AT 22
THE TAB WAS $200 FOR 4 PEOPLE

If you enjoy eye rolling from the waiter, spending tons of money to have horrendous service, and getting average food for your money, then you've found your restaurant
First, I went on Valentine's Day and waiters were running around like chickens with their heads cut off
Not very romantic at all
Second, my waiter (male) obviously has a superiority complex
When i did not want to check my coat, i got an eye roll
Another when I did not feel like wine

I have been going to Ino for several years and always love it
a lot of the staff stays consistent, so you see a lot of the same people and they usually recognize you
wine list is great, there's always something to suit my mood
the atmosphere, although cramped, couldnt be better
it's perfect for a date, catching up with an old friend, or a simple lunch by yourself at the tiny bar
the food is terrific
my favorites: the truffled egg toast (i'm drooling right now) and the panino with cacciatorini, goat cheese, and black olive tappenade are the top
cheese plate is a little disappointing (average/cooking cheeses like grana padano and taleggio, if my memory serves)
i'm not much of a dessert person, but i go crazy for the nutella dessert
as for beverages, i dont know an awful lot about italian wine but i usually get the prosecco
once i remember enjoying a really nice dolcetto
as for beer, they usually carry about 3
one is a seasonal brooklyn brewery beer on draft, and two are bottles, one of which is a favorite of mine (schneider aventinus, which is hard to find in nyc bars or restaurants)
service is quick, not overly friendly, but hey it's a small place and the servers are constantly busy
always prompt, though, and i have never had anyone there make any mistakes
even at their busiest times, i have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table
overall, one of my favorite places EVER
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating
(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!) Wine list is extensive without being over-priced
Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials
Definitely a neighborhood favorite
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it! The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly
The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy! I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's
I don't live in NY but my best friend does
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone
The prices are great, the food is excellent (try the white bean soup when they have it, it's excellent!) and the service is good
I've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!
We went to Ino for Valentines
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service
We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited
When we sat, we got great and fast service
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes
Make sure you try this place as often as you can
We'd heard great things about this restaurant and loved 'Inoteca, but 'Ino was awful
The waiter was incredibly rude, the bartender was antagonistic, and when the check was wrong, they looked at us with scorn
While 'Ino's food is delicious, nothing is worth the attitude
I had the best pannini I have had in the city last night
We went to this small great place in the villiage
We started with an antipasti plate that was amazing
Then we moved into the great pannini
I opted for the special they were running for the day which had a homemade spicy mustard that was amazing
We started with a great glass of wine that Jeff suggested, then he suggested an amazing bottle
He knew his stuff
If you have the chance go to this place
I love this place
The truffle egg toast is sublime
They have an small, but amazing wine list (have the Prosecco)
The space is small and quaint and cute and casual
Which leads to my only complaint about 'ino: the service can be a little too casual
If aloof is what they're going for, 'ino takes the cake
I walked into a small gem
They serve great sandwiches paired with amazing Italian wines
I couldn't believe how great the food was done in such a small kitchen
The man behind the bar, Jeff was very informative and very friendly
'ino is a simple idea pulled off well
They serve mostly paninis (fancy Italian sandwiches)
They are DELICIOUS!!! The wine list is great and helps improve the ambience
The space is a bit cramped and the waitress seemed to avoid eye contact at all costs, however, I would recommend you go just for the food
The bruschetta appetizers are also DELICIOUS!!
i love 'ino
they serve consistently good food and i find that the bartender and manager really know about the wine
the waitresses are horrible, however
they don't even know what cheeses are on their cheese plate
try to aviod them and have the manager serve you
try the cachitorini (sp), goat cheese and olive pesto panini
you will dream of it
and go late! you'll get a table
I had read about this place and really wanted to try it, but I was not sure about it given the limited menu
However, this place is great! Its cheap and everything is fresh and good
If you are in the mood for good, fresh paninis, check this place out
The first time I went to 'ino, five years ago, I was unfamiliar with downtown, and was unable to find it again until I was taken there a year later - but never forgot the amazing experience I had had
Since then, I have moved downtown, and have been nearly a regular for the past two years
What a consistently, great place to go! Their food is always good, and the waitstaff is always friendly, even though they are thoroughly crowded
Hint - go late
A perfect place to stop for a quick bite to eat, made from quality ingredients for an affordable price
When it gets packed, it can be a wait, given the tiny space it's in
But the space adds to the charm of the room
Always try one of the daily specials, in addition to all the tasty morsels on the menu
Although I've only gone in during the day, I'm tempted to see how the ambiance changes during the night
This is an adorable and affordable answer to the trendy and faceless cafes in the west village
'ino provides stability to the wine menu, while pairing up Italian classics with a big serving of charm
The only drawback is that the tiny cafe can only hold so many people with even less tables available, so if you are lucky enough to score a table, stay put with a date and some wine, because no place nearby can serve so much romance with such quality eats
The experience you have here depends on who serves you! Most of the staff are friendly but if you're unlucky enough to be served by the waitress that isn't, then the experience can be rather unpleasant
After 3 years of dining here (and always tipping well), I expect to be treated better
If I wait an hour for a table (which I often do) I don't expect to be rushed once finally seated and be forced to order everything at once
I also don't expect to be handed the check the minute I finish eating
Granted the food is excellent and very cheap but would like to be served with a smile occasionally
I simply cannot get enough of this place
I almost hate to write a review for fear that it will become too crowded
The food, the wine, the sweet and funny wait staff = a perfect combination
Go to 'ino to sit with your girlfriends and chat the night away over delicious eats (cheese and olive plates, antipasti, panini, basil pesto bruschetta -*a must-have*) and reasonably priced wine
You'll be planning your next visit before you finish with your first!
i try not to eat there too often but i can't help it - i crave their antipasto platter and arugula salad
it's a great little place that's open late and serves delicious, simple food
Totally delightful! My favorite new discovery is this tiny cafe

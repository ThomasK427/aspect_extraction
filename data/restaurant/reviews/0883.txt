Starters such as shrimp rolls and chopped salad are fresh and flavorful, if average
An appetizer of polenta with mushrooms, however, melds taste, texture and presentation--tangy dressing deftly pulls together the smoky flavors
The juicy burger (available at all hours) with a side of perfectly crisped fries beats out upscale fare like somewhat bland pork chops
Homemade desserts include light, airy cheesecake and rich chocolate mousse cake
Went to Downtown Atlantic the other night for the first time, but definitely not my last
The food was incredible
Crab cakes that were mostly crab! A polenta appetizer that was so simple and so tasty
Entrees were equally as good
And a nice selection of wines under $20 - which is great for the wine non-connoisseur
The waitress checked up on us just enough not to think she forgot about us or that she was overbearing
Overall, a great dining experience
One thing - it was a little warm in the place so don't overdress
In all fairness I have given this restaurant 5 chances once, only once did they get it right
Everytime I order the food for delivery they forget something--different times they forgot my fries, one time my soda, another time a cupcake
They never brought me my soda when I told them it wasn't in the bag when they forgot my fries they brought them to me cold
Their delivery time sucks--often over an hour wait the girl on the other end of the phone always rushes you
All in all the fries are phenomenal, the cupcakes delicious (try the reeses peanut butter one) the sticky buns are even better they serve the best carrot soup I ever tasted
My only criticism is that the restaurant gets very loud
The food is wonderful, and the desserts and baked goods are really wonderful
I'd passed by the Downtown Atlantic a few times on my way to work, and noticed the sign in the window advertising live jazz on Sunday nights
So last night my date and I decided to have dinner there
It was a smart move! The food was excellent and served in very generous portions; the seared tuna appetizer was especially delicious
(I only wish we'd had room for dessert from the bakery, but we were way too full for that! Next time, for sure
) The jazz was terrific and we found the restaurant's ambience elegant but not overly formal
A diverse dining crowd and friendly service added to the pleasure of the evening
I'm looking forward to becoming a Sunday evening regular
i've been to downtown several times now and it's been consistently good- both food and service
after appetizer and my main entree i usually don't have room left for dessert, but i have had a piece of chocolate cake once and it was a sweet ending
when you walk through the door you are welcomed by a wonderful display of desserts that are tempting
(although i have to admit i am a little bias, since i've come to love sweet melissa's on court street and nothing compares to their desserts
) overall, downtown atlantic has been a great dining experience and i will continue to go back
I can not believe the reviews for this place
I haven't had a plain old burger here but I did try a fish dish that was absolutely the most tasteless meal I have ever had
My husband's meal was equally tasteless
Would not go back
I have been here a few times, for lunch and dinner
The food is excellent
Service is very courteous and helpful
I recommend the pulled pork sandwich
Delicious
Prices are also extremely reasonable
This place is a great deal and worth the trip from Manhattan
Downtown Atlantic is a great eatery! The food is traditional american with a great modern flare
The bakery is absolutely phenominal between the cookies and cakes to specialty items that are provided
I think that everyone should go to Downtown Atlantic if they want to experience old world Brooklyn!
Love this laid back, spacious, comfortable restaurant
You can actually have a conversation with dinner (no neighbors sitting on top of you or loud disco music) and the food
the crab cakes are the best, but so is the rack of lamb and the salads and desserts
So I guess everything is good but the wines priced around $20 are wonderful
I just keep coming back again and again
Maybe I should not be telling too many people but this
I've been to this restaurant several times now and the food is consistently outstanding
What's also great is the innovative and different specials that are offered
and the wine list is really amazing - in that there are 20 wines o the list that you can enjoy for $20 and less
Overall I found this restaurant to be a place where my wife and myself came come to and enjoy a hamburger and beer and at the same time order a rack of lamb with a bottle of Silverado
Bravo!
I felt that I was home at a family gathering the food was delicious the staff was attentive the spring rolls were out of this world
I had the cod fish
which was delicious
my wife had the crab cakes which I tasted and will have on my next visit
she also had the rack of lamb which she has not stopped talking about
this is the only restruant where i was able to buy a bottle of wine which was delicious for under 20 dollars
the deserts were delicious dont pass the cheese cakes by
My girlfriend and I went her last Saturday night and we had one of the best dining experiences ever
We live in the area and were excited to find a new restaurant, that was unlike anything on Smith St
, and we did
We were made to feel like one of the family at this family owned and operated gem
The service was very attentive and the Franks may just join you at your table to say hello
The 20 wines under $20 was a great surprise, and the food was outstanding
Try the crab cakes, we have never had any better
The live jazz was great as well
I could go on and on, but try it for yourself
Robert's Cafe serves the best coffee in Bayonne - hands down
Prior to discovering that this establishment existed, I would drive all the way to Jersey City for a decent latte
The prices are reasonable, and the shop is tastefully decorated
In addition, Robert's Cafe carries soy milk - unlike many of the other coffee shops in the area
My only criticisms are the hours (they don't open until 11am on most days) and the service (they appear to be understaffed)
Other than that, this is the best destination for a hard-to-please coffee connoisseur
This restaurant is fantastic
Their menu offers dishes from Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, China, and Thailand
Everything I've tried has been heavenly!! (Last time I was there, I had the fried gyoza, spring rolls, and crab rangoon
OH MY GOD!! You have to try them
Even their California Roll just bursts with flavor
I don't know how they do it
) With the great food comes warm and friendly service
Although the restaurant is small, it works out very well because the waiters are able to provide you with more attention
The restaurant is very clean, so are the bathrooms!! The next time you're in Hoboken, have lunch or dinner here
It's so worth it
Get the massman curry, the curry puff, the calamari, the spicy seafood noodles! Get everything! The food is great and the setting is great as well
The servers are polite and helpful
It's a little hard to get a stroller in there, and they don't have parking, but the food makes up for it
Don't forget the creme brulee in the end
=)
Artistic, romantic, poetic, inspiring, and classy
Not enough words to describe this secret utopia
From the minute I stepped inside I knew I was hooked
Coffee is amazing and food is flawless
If you are familiar with Cuban culture, you will definately appreciate it a lot more
Caramel Latte's are my favorite and the Barcelona Sandwich
Starbucks is tasteless garbage compared to this heavenly place

The chocolate flan was fantastic and all the ice cream flavors are original and delicious
Superb service and unassuming, accomodating somalier
A definite must!!!
Let me set the scene for you
Mas is located along a hip side street in the West Village
There was a bar directly in front of the door that had a trendy barkeep mixing up martinis and gabbing with regulars
There were beautiful, rustic fabrics that covered large pillows and a long cushion for those sitting along the wall
The silverware was laid upon a slab of slate and the table was adorned with cymbidium orchids
We had an incredible lobster bisque that was served with various breads
Next was a delicious squid salad
This was surprisingly superb
We each had a unique entree, mine was the venison wrapped in spinach and served with figs and such
Probably the best tasting morsel of food I have ever eaten
And the array of desserts were even better
The place is truly something to write home about
I ate at Mas the other night and had one of the best meals ever
The service was great, the foot was awesome, and the wine was superb
What more could I ask for? I took a date there after a friend told me about it
She loved it too
We are both going back again--together
What a beautiful place
We were treated like family
The nicest service in the city and the best looking wine captain (Eugene!)
The wine list is mostly French, and fantastic
Food is equally great
We can't wait to go back
Thanks for a terrific evening, our friends were most impressed!
What a great neighborhood restaurant
They made the most of the space with the decor
The bar was uncomfortably warm but the bartender took good care of us while we waited for our table
Once seated, we were well cared for
The service was gracious and warm
We followed our server's recommendations - and enjoyed the food
Overall well balance and well executed food
A few dishes still need to be tweaked and worked on
Absolutely loved the wine list
I look forward to my next visit!
I felt that the service and ambience were ranked high at Mas
However, the overall consensus of my dinner group of 8 ppl were that the portions were extremely too small and the wine pairing even more frugal
The quality of the food was excellent, but mere bite sized portions did not justify the value of our meal
I would not return to this restaurant
I went to Mas the other day and had a lovely experience
The waitstaff is very knowledgeable and attentive, but not overbearing
The food (only the late night menu) was really creative and good, although the portions were miniscule
The wine list is nice and the coctails are delicious
My friends liked the dessert and the chocolate stout icecream
Don't sit at the tree stump seats in the front if you can help it, they are uncomfortable
Beautiful ambiance, try the tuna
I ate at Mas last night and found it to be one of the most beautiful dining experiences I have had while living in NYC
The tuna beurre noisette was stunning and the blending of scallop crusted halibut with an alfonso olive sauce sang to me
The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing and each described the manner of my food's preparation perfectly
The staff was also extremely knowledgeable about the restaurant's wine list and recommended an excellent pairing
My partner had the rack of lamb and raved about it the whole ride home
Absolutely try this place
It is a gem
Crowded on a Monday night, even with reservations, we waited about 25 minutes
But the excellent wine list and friendly service at the bar made the wait easy and pleasant
Once seated, the meal and service made the wait well worth it
The tuna appetizer was flavorful and fresh, squab entree tender and juicy, cherry sorbet dessert refreshing -- the perfectly sweet ending to a wonderful meal
Soft lighting beautiful surroundings abound at this phenomenal new treasure
The food was astounding, everything that you would expect from such a highly decorated chef
The service was great - An amazing wine list
Perfect for a romatic evening out
The food was good (the place is new, I understand and I REALLY look forward to dining here in a year or so when kinks have been worked out) - drinks were great, the perfect spot for a second date - if you don't feel chemistry in this place, you probably never will
It's charged
But lets talk about the aesthetics
AMAZING
This is such a sexy space - the furniture is beautiful, the BATHROOM is beautiful, the staff is beautiful, the patrons are beautiful

Maybe the drinks were a little TOO great
It makes me so sad to report that we didn't love the food at Mas because the space, service, wine list, cocktails and overall vibe were all really amazing
The lamb was ok, the tuna was good, the zucchini flower with crab in mint soup was not so good and the vegetable terrine (sp?) was not great either
Please take another look at your menu because i really want to dine at Mas again!
I am a very tough critic, and I found the food to be excellent
The atmosphere was delightful- great for a romantic evening
I've already recommended it to everyone I know
I checked out Mas on Saturday and was blown away
Excellent food, great looking spot
what more can I say
Mas is definitely worth checking out
Dinner at Mas was amazing
Galen's food was phenomenal, and the decor was spacious yet warm and cozy
I will definitely go back
The Scene The most striking feature of this Flatbush Avenue restaurant is its arched, blazing oven in back of the open kitchen
Exposed brick walls and a long row of square wooden tables lend an earthiness to the frequently packed room, which leads out to a leafy patio
The Food Sustainable, independent farms provide the majority of ingredients, from veggies to milk to beef
Among the starters are a zesty house-cured sardine crostini, a delicate yet heartily flavored prosciutto di Parma and a "Jewish ghetto style" fried artichoke with an onion-skin crispiness
Toppings on the stellar thin-crust pizzas include vibrantly seasoned, tender meatballs; ricotta and parsley pesto with a refreshing accent of mint; and pancetta, ramps and fontina, which play off each other in pungent harmony
Desserts of smooth anise pannacotta and homemade pistachio ice cream with crushed nuts are subtle and beautifully textured
A meal at Franny's is guaranteed heaven
Go when you first get your paycheck in the mail; the prices are on the high side, but it'll ruin the experience if you waste your energy trying to be stingy
Every pizza on the menu is divine - provolone and onions, anything with sausage, and the classic bufalo mozzarella and tomato are hard to pass up, and one time they had one with fontina and porcini mushrooms
it was my absolute favorite but I havent seen it since, so if they have it when you go, GET IT! And whatever you do, save room for dessert and order one of everything
I'm not kidding
Especially if they have the Fiore di Latte gelato - it's otherworldly; the panna cotta and chocolate sorbet are equally dreamy
If the wait for a table is too long, just sit at the bar; you will still have a great time
Bon appetit!
The pizzas are generally very good, but can be hit-and-miss at times
The Tomato and Provolone Piccante with Red Onions pie was simply divine, but the Anchovy pie was so-so
Since the portions are small, it may not be easy to share with a large group

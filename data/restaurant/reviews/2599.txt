Those parts that were not brown were hard -- apparently from sitting out too long
When I pointed this out to the waiter he told me that all of the lox is like that
It seemed that the waiter randomly decided which tables he would be nice to and which he would ignore
Our service was not bad but people all around us were getting frustrated and walking out
Do not waste your time or money on this place
New York offers so much more
I've never been more disappointed and angry over a meal
Overpriced, bad food
Service terrible
Never NEVER go to this place, it is AWFUL!!
Made the mistake of going here with out of town guests prior to moving to NYC
The WORST meal I've ever had in my life! The prices were horrible as well, as any place usually is in Times Square
The awful cheese omlet that I had was $12 and arrived ice cold
Even the coffee was horrendous
very weak with no flavor and coffee grounds floating in it
Go anywhere but here!
Most unsatisfying experience I've ever had at a NY restaurant, and I am not prone to exaggeration
The food is thoroughly average diner fare, comparable to what you'd find at any truck stop in the country
The difference is that the prices here are extortionist - $17
00 for a burger? This place is your classic tourist trap, attracting people based on some vague name recognition
To top it off, the service was extremely poor
Avoid this place like the plague
We, 2 people, went here after being the the studio audience of Good Morning America on a Monday morning
I usually try not to go anywhere in Times Square to eat
You can get better food, quality and priced, in other areas of NY City
None the less, we were hungry so we went there
They sent us downstairs, which was very quiet
Only one other couple down there
We both had breakfast
Mom had Lox and bagel
I had 2 eggs over med
I figure those are pretty hard to screw up
We both had coffee, which the waiter (nice guy) kept filling for us without us asking
Our total for this was about $30 including tip
I think this is very expensive for breakfast
But oh well
If I had the choice again, I'd go here if I had too but would prefer somewhere else
The over-priced food aside, the service here was terrible
The waitor refused to pick up our plates after we were finished and was very rude throughout the entire meal
And when I left him a VERY tiny tup, which he deserved, he actually started yelling at us!!! Even the cheesecake was not memorable enough to warrent coming back
Businesses don't just fail - they fail to change
On a recent visit to Times Square, we decided to catch a sandwich somewhere and popped into Lindy's
For starters, the ambience is archaic
It isn't new or energetic - it is stale
The place wasn't very clean either
The hostess escorted us past empty tables and booths to seat us (3 women) in front of the kitchen door
We asked to be seated in a booth instead and were (this time next to the beverage station), but the damage (the insult) was done
When we saw the $17 price tag on an egg salad sandwich, we decided Lindy's didn't have anything we wanted
This place was WAY overpriced and the food was nothing to write home about
I do not know how they stay in business except that they rip people off royaly
The service was not good and I did not enjoy our meal there
I would never eat there ever again
What a waste!
I think they try to seat people downstairs so it's harder to bolt when you see their prices
So-so food, overpriced (at least for breakfast)
The waitress kept vetoing people's orders (e
g
You don't want the corned beef hash
It comes from a can
Apparently a favorite with the famous decades ago, but nothing impressive today
Decided to have lunch here, as we've heard the cheesecake is good
When the waitress came over to take our order, she said there was a 20 minute wait on all orders since the kitchen staff was back logged
We decided to order soup (over $6 a bowl), thinking that would be quick, however our waitress then said the soup is OUT OF A CAN and still would be a 20 minute wait since the tickets are processed in order
We then left and ate somewhere else
The food is very overpriced
$15 for a sandwich, which didn't seem to include anything else
$3
50 for a coke, includes free refills, but how much coke does the average person drink?
Horrible! The food was poor
The prices were an absolute joke
I will never even consider going back there
I'm assuming the only peole who frequent this place are the first timers as I was when I went
The cheesecake was good (at that price it ought to be)
The rest of the food was OK, but no better than other far less expensive restaraunts
The food arrives, heavy with flavor and is poured onto a large circular dish with a cool injeera roti on the bottom
Shared between all members at the table, the large dish also contains a sublime collection of lentils and vegetarian
Yes, the service is a little slower than average but the food has been worth every visit, every time
All of it is good but I have to recommend the meat sambosa, doro wat, tibs wat, yebeg alecha and the whole fish
Except for the sour Injeras (bread), I like this place
The food is great, the wine is good and I always go for the veggie combo
Dont like the somboza too much - I prefer their washington street branch
The space and decor aren't much to look at, but the low lighting and ethopian music soften things up and the food is delicious - i always get the vegetarian combo which used to be enough for two people but these days it's a bit smaller and a nice big meal for one
This may have been the worst experience I've ever had
The service was so unbelievably slow, even though we were practically the only people in the place
They blamed the slow service on the fact that the dishes we ordered take a long time to make
Out of their entire wine list, they had maybe two bottles of wine actually available
The food was practically inedible
The bread was a texture I can't even describe
I'll never go back
I could write a long diatribe about how this restaurant failed to meet expectations, but suffice it to say, as we were walking home, having given leave to our friends, my gf and I struggled to come up with any dining experience which had ever been worse, and we both came to the conclusion that we had just suffered through the worst meal we had ever had
We planned on going to Queen of Sheeba, another Ethiopian restaurant in the neighborhood, but it was full
We then found Meskerem and decided to eat there instead
The service was awful
It took 20 minutes for anyone to even come by the table
The menu looked great but the tender beef was like well-chewed chewing gum and the other dishes were not any more tender or palatable
The bread was also awful
The food arrived after we'd waited an hour
This was a funny experience but we will never go back
Never had Ethiopian before, and thw wait staff was very helpful
The food was very good

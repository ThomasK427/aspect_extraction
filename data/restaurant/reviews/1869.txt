Service is friendly and they have random live performances- On a sunday, the waitstaff broke into song and dance every 15-30 min, and once on a saturday a lady was playing experimental music on an electric harp
The characters that come up from downstairs are always fun
Usually I end up at Marion's for a friend's birthday or when I have out of town guests
I recently went to Marion's just for dinner with my boyfriend hand had the most wonderful time! The food was excellent, I had forgotten how great it was there
I had the Pork Schnitzle with a martini off of their new XXX Drink Menu
Go to Marion's, you will have an amazing time!
I went to Marion's recently with a large group of friends for a birthday
Although we waited a significant amount of time to be seated, the staff made sure we were happy by accomodating us in other ways
The mixers here are fantastic and personable- we all left very happy with our experience at Marion's
Beware their Cajun Martini- it will burn a hole in your belly!
Marions is a gimmic place
It's nice, but Citysearch had this in their top 5 fondue roundup
That is a mistake
Marions only has Cheese fondue that tastes like velveta
Not their stong point
If you want really fantastic fondue, cheese, beef or chocolate - there's only one place in the city that does that: Mont Blanc on W
48th
They have a fondue special each Sunday so we trotted on down to check this out
The wine selection is non-existent - 2 reds and both not good
However, they had an entire card dedicated to fancy mixed drinks
The decor is dinerish
The fondue was mediocre to slightly disappointing
It was an ample entree but left you wanting something more in the taste department
Yes, the atmosphere is fun, and the Pontani Sisters are brilliant and beautiful
But the cocktails and the food just don't match up to the fabulous ambience
They're fine, but not spetacular (nor cheap), which makes them disappointing in comparison
I went with my family to Marion's on Thanksgiving
The menu was a traditional Thanksgiving menu
There were interesting cocktail choices, but they were not as good as they sounded
The food was only slightly above average
What stood out was the service
We were dining with a not-quite 2 year old, so we didn't want to linger
When we told them so, our food arrived very quickly
And all the staff helped out with the baby
The atmosphere was warm and friendly
A friend came into town for one night
New York is a lot of things, but it ain't a one night town
I could have bribed my way to Babbo, or dragged him to any one of New York's innumerable cloned McNally McBistros
Instead, I remembered Marion's - a place with class, real style, and real character
All that makes good food and good drink that much easier to enjoy
This place is so cute, love it, love it, love it
you have to check out the brunch and all the great local fashion shows put on my the up-and-coming designers!
Jean Claude is such a quaint spot with friendly wait staff, authentic French menu and a relaxed charming atmosphere
The scallops are my favorite and my friends and I love to stop in for a glass of wine on a Sat
afternoon
I've honestly never had a bad meal there
Highly recommended for a casual meal with friends in a fun neighborhood!
My boyfriend and I were lured into going to Jean Claude because of its quaint and cosy outside look but we found the food and the atmosphere to be completely lacking
a je ne sais quoi
The prix fixe menu seemed like such a bargain but we could not really finish our meals, they were so incredibly bland!
Strolled into this restaurant, randomly because it looked quaint and romantic, yet relaxed and also because my sweetie was ravenous ! The food is inexpenisve for a french restaurant in the city
The dishes were good, not exceptional but good and great for the price
The atmosphere is cute, quaint and romantic and great for a relaxed date
I wouldn't reccomend the cod however, it is very bland ( although our waiter recomended it) But the hanger steak is good
I went to Jean Claude on a Thusday evening and it was wonderful! The food was fantastic
great salad and a delicious Skate dish
We were seated right away and the atmosphere was very quaint and intimate
I will go again in a heartbeat!
keep jean claude on your short list, everyone
it's rare to find such top-notch, high-quality authentic french food, especially in soho
quiet and quaint, romantic but casual, it's perfect for a laid-back date night with your sweetheart
This is one of my favorite restaurants for a casual, fun, intimate, delicious meal
I couldn't believe the quality of food considering the inexpensive prices
This is how restaurants should be--offering good food without trying to rip you off
Service was friendly, atmosphere relaxed and pleasant
I'll always come back here
Great wine and good french food for the price
Inexpensive and fullfilling
The foie gra appetizer is fantastic and the steak frites is a good value
I suggest if you want a medium steak ask for it bloody, it seems they usually over cook mine, but other then that the service was good and my waiter was very attentive
The only downside is that the place is small and the seats are too close together therefore not much privacy if you are there with a date
Inexpensive french food, Jean claude? yes
Food was great - romantic for dates
The service was ok, but the staff was charming
While I could do without the quail appetizer, the skate was fabulous
Service was a little slow but in some weird way, it added the French atmosphere
This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
It's a place I like to go to have a chat with a close friend or have an intimate evening with my date
The food here is divine, especially the seafood
Try the skate, it's sooooooo good
The place is pretty small, so if you intend to go with a large group, you should go late into the night or in the early evening
The intimate setting in this French Bistro is perfect for dates and double dates
The menu, although not extensive, includes a must-try foie gras appetizer, as well as very tasty red snapper and hangar steak
Most entrees average $16-$21, making it very reasonably priced
Since the restaurant itself is not large, it is probably difficult to get a table during peak dinner times on Friday and Saturday
We have always gone during the week around 8pm and have never had a problem getting seated immediately
We take all of our out-of-town friends there at least once and they have all loved it
In a city where you all too often over pay for bad food and poor service, Jean Claude shouldn't be missed
Reasonably priced good food and friendly service, what's not to like? There are few places in the city where you get what you pay for, this is at the top of the list
I've eaten at Mexican restaurants all over, and this is the best Mexican food anywhere
The restaurant is homey and cozy with wonderful service
When I lived in New York, I ate there on an average of once a week! I really miss Mexican Village
Inexpensive, great food, run by a family that is very friendly
The decor isn't much, but the food makes up for it
My husband and I ate here for dinner on a Friday night
We were attended to very quickly and courteously
The atmosphere is warm and inviting - loved the murals
We ordered the Pulpo a La Gallega as an appetizer and shared a Paella Marinera as an entree
For dessert, we tried the Tartufo
We loved it all

Cozy comfy place
Nice friendly staff, interesting wine list, amazing food
Service was still a little clumsy, but perhaps still working out some kinks
Great wine pairings and terrific service from the sommelier
Bread soup was so good, can't wait to go back
Food is the main attraction
Top quality and a lot of thought went into the menu
The pre fixe lets you select from anything you want, a refreshing change
Our waiter, Stever, I think was possibly the best waiter we have had in Manhattan! I will be back
My entire experience here was great
I went last night with a dinner group, we were 5 total
We had reservations for 7pm but waited for a late member and were not rushed at all by the host
Our waiter, Marshall, was so good
He kept up with our banter and wasn't overbearing in any way
He was also very familiar with the food and made great suggestions
We all chose to go with the $65, five course, fixed price meal - great deal, very filling
I highly recommend the the asparagus with garlic custard from the 2nd course - very tasty
I could go on on about this place if only I had more space here
Pros: The food was all really good
Some things excellent--the foie gras terrine, lobster bolognese
The service was well-coordinated
The menu is wide-ranging
Seating was comfortable and tables well-spaced
At $55 the 4-course tasting is a decent value
Cons: the waiter we had was overly effusive about the wines--we had the 4 course tasting with paired wines all of which came from the wines by the glass list (rather typical these days)
The very green-ness didn't bother us though we sat in the smaller area to the right of the bar
The crowd was surprisngly old for a foodie destination
Made my first trip to Telepan this weekend for my birthday dinner - what a nice experience! The menu is full of interesting choices and the 4-course prix fixe is a great value, although they could have been more generous with their pour as far as wine is concerned and with some of their meal portions
The breakdown: The yellowtail appetizer was only okay, but the rabbit was excellent
Lobster bolognese was fine (the lobster was delicious but the pasta was only so-so), but short ribs were fantastic
The scallop entree was again only okay (and skimpy - 2 smallish scallops), but the pork entree was wonderful
Steamed chocolate cake was a little dry but caramel brioche profiteroles were brilliant
CHOOSE CAREFULLY and you'll have a great meal!
The four course price here can't be beat, and the quality of the food is amazing
However, our waiter had the learning curve of a 2 year old
After getting the managers attention, however, the rest of our night was great
Braised short ribs are good, sirloin is also great
With wine the meal goes well above 55 per head but is totally worth it
Just ask not to get the Ecuadorian waiter
I've been to Telepan twice, and sat once at the bar and once at a table
The bar service is wonderful
It was about 10pm on a Friday and the place was packed
I found friendly, generous bartenders who made sure to keep my wine glass full and neighborhood locals at the bar who were always up for conversation with strangers
Table service (there were 3 of us, with a 9pm reservation on a Saturday) was fantastic as well
Our waiter picked a fantastic wine, helped us navigate the menu, and we were all very pleased with most everything we ate
The smoked trout appetizer is fantastic! The only thing that was disappointing was dessert
The carrot cake was iffy at best, though the cream cheese ice cream that came with it was fabulous
Overall, I really enjoyed myself at Telepan
I'll definitely be back!
It was our second visit to Telepan that really impressed us
We had learned how to successfully navigate the tasting menus and had one of the most memorable meals of our lives
The depth of the wine cellar is outstanding the knowledge of the sommelier should be taken advantage of
The service was impeccable the staff was eager to cater our meal to our every whim
Ask you shall receive! It will be a fantastic experience
1st visit to Telepan Friday 2/24 at ~ 7PM
place already in full swing
Unusually sophisticated serene for UWS (knockout color scheme rear-wall murals), crowd an eclectic mix of mostly 40-up, cordial vibe
NICE, wood horseshoe bar area of ~ 15 seats but
TOO COLD, PEOPLE!! Since their bar seems incredibly hot, any chance mgmt
could install one of those winter vestibules to actually keep it WARM?!? Those leather door drapes just can't do it all alone
And OH YES! Food very good, wines excellent (though their 'pour' could be a bit more generous)!
I've eaten in many top-rated restaurants in NYC
and have returned to Telepan *twice* since it opened, so impressed was I
The yellowtail appetizer with mint is sheer bliss
The duck is the best I've ever had
The halibut is so tender, it's as if were made of ice cream
Take advantage of the $55 four-course tasting menu -- a STEAL that allows you to choose absolutely anything on the menu in any order you please
That could mean 3 main courses and a dessert, people! Think about it
Martha Stewart sat at a neighboring table and was having a grand ol' time
Ambience is unpretentious, yet romantic
Some delicious, affordable wines on the menu -- sommelier is EXCEPTIONALLY gifted in food/wine matching
A delightful amuse bouche begins the experience, complimentary sweets provide the finish
Impeccable
Chef Bill Telepan is a culinary great -- you will not be disappointed!
I saw the New York mag review last week and was hopeful only to be disappointed at every turn
It began with a matre d' that had an attitude appropriate for Nobu not a poorly designed UWS spot with food to match
Not that I got to really appreciate the food
Mine was served cold and my wife had a salad
There are so many good restaurants around, I will not be back
When you walk through the door, you will find yourself standing below deck in a ships cabin
The ambiance is very warm and inviting, as are the owners and staff
Go a few times and youll feel like Norm at Cheers
Probably the best jukebox in Manhattan, with some of the owners own compilation cds thrown in
In true NYC form, Woodys is a mini melting pot
People from all walks of life frequent the place, from fashionista and finance to fireman and biker
Guys, the walls are covered with flat screens so you wont miss a second of the game
Ladies, some of the tastiest drinks in the city, (cute/clean bathroom too always important!)
Amazing food, great people, good times!
I went here with my girlfriend and a couple of friends just to grab a quick beer and we wound up staying the whole night
The staff made us feel right at home and the food was fantastic
the bartenders and waitresses all have a great sense of humor, which was why we decided to stay there the whole night
I had the Philly cheese steak and it was probably one of the best I have ever had
Highly recomended
I work nearby on 16th and 9th, and in four years I have not encountered bar food like this
These folks have possibly the best chicken wings I have ever eaten
I go in for lunch whenever I can and have the thinnest sliced pastrami, along with fresh cut home-made potato chips
My fav dish is the stuffed skirt steak, which you can choose 3 of any stuffings
The cut is top notch
It's an inviting bar
Cozy, sort of like a ski lodge

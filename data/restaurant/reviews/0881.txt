highly recommend the yellowtail appetizer (the big chunk of toasted hamachi)
i actually like smaller portions b/c that way you don't get grossly full, so i definitely enjoyed the sushi, extremely fresh, same quality as the original jewel bako on 5th st
The sushi here was phenomenal but there was just too little of it
We ordered the $50 sushi/sashimi tasting menu
The sushi pieces were really small
I left here wanting more food
Service was alright
The waitress spoke limited English so it was hard to understand what she was saying and ask questions
They really should put an insert of specials in the menu
Also, the waitress did not come by once to refill the water
However, we were treated to complimentary appetizers albeit small and complimentary sakes
Just keep in mind before you come here, to not bring your full appetite but make sure your wallet is full
Sushi here is fantastic, but they don't spare much!
The food is very original absolutely deliciously fresh sushi
The decor atmosphere is also great
Wait staff is very courteous attentive
Would strongly recommend a tasting menu option
One of the best sushi spots hands down! Excellent service, freshest fish, delicately prepared
Truly a unique experience that I would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates quality sushi! A new favorite of mine
I went to JB Makimono, and it was a horrible experience
The hostess is the rudest I've experienced
The place is cramped, you'll be bumped against the entire dinner, all wrapped in a 'faux zen' experience
For the food, it depends on where else you've been, I've had much better
This place is midrange
no sea urchin served the night I went
The sushi was adequate, but no unique pieces or inventive touches
A raw bar appetizer came with two pieces of cooked shrimp, which I would've deemed ama-ebi a more appropriate choice in a 'raw-bar-appetizer'
Shrimp cocktail is for a steak house folks! Don't sit at the sushi bar, it's really cramped when they bring out dishes
That's if the strange hostess decides you're cool enough to get a table
Most people are asked to sit at the sushi bar, though they don't take reservations, hmm
how odd
Overall review:No stars
When I say this was the best sushi I've ever had, I mean I can never eat sushi anywhere else
The texture and flavor was indescribable
It was like I'd never eaten sushi before
There's only ten tables and it's shaped like the interior of a jewelry box, hence the name
I had the tasting menu which was about 10 pieces of sashimi and 10 pieces of sushi, plus yellowfin soup, many assorted sushi-type appetizers and a sake-steamed mushroom dish
It was sublime - just totally amazing
I left there feeling very full, but at the same time so contented and happy
Although a little pricey, it was worth every penny
If I ever top that, I'll be in heaven, literally
The service is no better than Jewel Bako
We were treated average but another couple was ignored because of the way they dressed and because they didn't want to spend as much
The food is decent, it passes for Japanese
However, I don't agree that another rest
should be opened when the first still lacks in many basic things
Service is slow, food is slow to come
Staff seems unhappy under the owners' glares
That ruined the flavor for us
The Scene With a prime corner view of the passing East Village scene, the dining room is full of life and high-energy
The decor is only faintly Mediterranean, with craft paper on the tables and a colorful assortment of plates
Most diners live in the neighborhood, though word of mouth draws some customers from further afield
Service is knowledgeable and amiable
The Food This is superlative northern Italian fare with an emphasis on fish
Cicchetti, a Venetian take on the small-plates concept, make a terrific starter or stand-alone bar snack: fried artichokes with tapenade, sour-sweet sardines and a luscious cod mousse stand out
Entree options are as inspired, especially the hearty braised lamb shank, delicate baked salmon and a host of fine pastas, including a prize-worthy spaghetti and meatballs, and tender hand-rolled pici with asparagus in butter sauce
The tiramisu more than holds its own against the competition
My birthday was yesterday, and i took 7 of my friends to eat here
all i can say is that the food is delicious, and that it is the best value in town
try the fusilli (though be warned that it is VERY rich), and the ciocolatissimo dessert is to die for
my one complaint is that when we were finished with our dinner, it took an abnormally long time for our waitress to get with the program and bring us our check
other than that, absolutely no complaints
highly reccomend
foods delcious, great corner location and outdoor seating, however service is lacking ( staff are all very friendly, just not very attentive or organized)
We have been to this place around three times now and everytime it is a different experience
This place is pretty romantic in the summer when they have outdoor seating and great musicians
Our favorite appetizer before was the calamari but on our latest visit it was tasteless and a bit stringy
Their pastas are usually very good and the salmon is not bad either
Service is fine and the prices are not too expensive compared to other area restaurants
The place looks nice from the outside, but the positives stop there
The brunch menu looks like a value, however, the service is incredibly poor
The server drank his coffee while we waited for our bread basket and drinks
The food was served cold
I asked for a cup of coffee, but had to ask several times
Management needs to take staffing decisions more seriously
Good Luck!
We were there this weekend and I must say the review on Citysearch is outdated, the menu is completely different than what is written here
Anyhow, we had a GREAT time! The young, friendly staff was very attentive, we were seated promptly, and the food was terrific
I had their special pasta with cheese fondue that was to die for, and my partner had the rib eye steak with roasted potatoes
Yummy!
I was very excited to try this restaurant after hearing about their Cicchetti - small tapas-like plates
But we were very disappointed to find out that they no longer serve them
In fact, the waitress said that about a year ago, new management came in, and that they are no longer even Venetian anymore, just a run-of-the-mill pan-Italian joint
The food was below average, being rather uninspired and very plain tasting
We ate upstairs, where at first, since we were the first table up there, it was pleasant
As soon as other people came up, the accoustics of the space just sky-rocketed the noise level
The service was not too bad, although it was a little slow and the dishes, when they came, were just thrown down on the table, without regard to who ordered what
We attended Le Zoccole's Sicilian party last Thursday and it was fantastic
The food was delicious, the service warm and friendly and at $30pp including wine the price could not be beat
We especially liked how it felt very much like dining at someone's home
The servers were extremely professional, especially considering the entire room needed to be served at the same time
Thank you for a wonderful experience, we will definitely be back to try the regular menu
Friendly service that shows in the repeat business
I enjoy watching the waiters with all the regulars
Great food
For all the Italian that is out there filling the streets, here is one that should last
The place was run by a bunch of I think I'm better than you and you should be serving me! type of people
The servers were rude
The food took forever to come out and when it came out it wasn't done well and had to be taken back to the kitchen
Once the bill came - we were expecting to get our change and when we had waited long enough we realized that the server had KEPT OUR CHANGE AS A TIP, which might I add was way more than 20%!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!

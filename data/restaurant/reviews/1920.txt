We also ordered a couple of appys
We'll be back to try the dinner menu soon
Went to the UWS one and was irritated
Average food way overpriced, OK drinks, bad atmosphere with blaring music, and bad service
When I spilled my drink because of the wobbly table the waitress not only charged me for it without giving me a new drink but threw a towel on the table for me to clean up the mess
I have no problems cleaning up messes I make, but not when a waitress gives me a disugusted look and tosses a dirty towel at me
NO TIP FOR YOU! Maybe it's bearable if you want to meet a few co-workers only for drinks, but why bother since there are so many other good Mexican restaurants in NYC with good food and service? Don't reward bad service and overpriced food
I occassionally go to Senor Swankys to meet with friends and grab dinner over some drinks when I'm looking to stay within a certain budget
They have two for one margaritas during happyhour, and serve nacho chips and salsa at the bar
The decor is very cute and its a friendly, upbeat place to be
The food is average, but with two for one margaritas, who's there for the food? I've never had anything but good things to say about the waitstaff-they let you take your time eating, they don't rush to clear your plates like some of the more upscale restaurants in the area
All in all, a great place to hang out and meet with friends during happy hour
I frequent a lot of Indian restaurants and I am so glad I found this restaurant from Citysearch
The lunch buffet was very fresh, perfect blend of spices and choices
The price is unbeatable as well
Service was prompt
A True Find!
We went there on Friday February 17 for dinner and we got a booth
The place was looking very nice and the service was excellent
The aroma of the food and the food itself was so delicious
I can't wait till I go back to eat there again
You will really enjoy yourself when you go there to eat, as for me I really did!
I used to go hear for the lunch buffet
The food is OK, nothing special
Recently, however, they started adding on a 20% service charge, which is totally riduculous
It's a buffet, for chissakes
20% for bringing water - no thanks
Put it out with the rest of the stuff and I'll serve myself
Not to mention the fact that the rude host does everything in his power to kick you out the second you finish eating
I've had my last lunch there
I went on a Tuesday night, so seating wasn't a problem at all
I enjoyed the atmosphere immensely
When we were seated we were led to this candlelit booth/nook that offered lots of privacy, however the seats were a touch uncomfortable
The waiter we had was courteous and conversational
Our food took about 10 minutes to arrive, but I attribute that to it being a Tuesday
I had the chicken curry and it was wonderful! The mango juice was tasty as well
At first they played traditional music, but turned on the radio to today's music, I would have much rather listened to the traditional music
All in all it was a great experience
The rating is a strong 8, but since I was dining with a 10 the restaurant was that much better ;)
The food is delicious! Service is very quick and waiters are very friendly! I will definitely go back!
Taste of India has delicious paneer and chicken tikka masala
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the saturday night live sitar and tabla music, it was fantastic!
I strongly feel that the two ratings of 10 that this resturant has are rigged ! I fell for the ratings and wasted my dough there
Not only was the chicken curry stale it also had the wrong spices
I grew up in a family of excellent authentic Indian cooks and I know my masalas (spices), but the cooks at this resturant dont
Also, this resturant doesn't offer any Indian chai which is the mark of hospitality for and good Indian resturant
'Cafe Dante' is a bit of a misnomer
The cafe exists, but it is only one part of the restaurant
The other part is a nice Italian restaurant
It is quiet, romantic, and offers delicious food
My friend ordered spaghetti, and I ordered the Chicken
The food was excellent and the portions were hearty
Best of all, the price for two came out to $35 without liquor
That's quite a bargain given the quality of the dining experience
Sadly, there have been some unpleasant recent developments
The waiters, for instance, have on occasion behaved in an abhorrently rude manner
Still, the food is outstanding, and the prices are reasonable for the area
The mere fact that they didn't serve American coffee is enough for a standing ovation
If you are going to be traditional you might as well go all the way! The waitresses bartenders speak Italian to one another, the menu is identical to what you'd see in any small town in Italy the deserts cafes are phenomenal
This place is a perfect stop after a dinner in SoHo
The one knock is that the restaurant furniture could be a little nicer to capture the mood, it's just a step up from folding chairs which is a bit of a disappointment
Nonetheless, a very cool, completely Italian desert cafe place in NoHo
and frankly one of the best in all of the city
maybe some will confuse the cozy little coffee-and-cake cafe for the restaurant next door (both owned by the same good owners), but dante is so much more than just a sweet little coffee place
its authentic italian food rivals much more expensive and celebrity-ridden joints (da silvano's food is nothing compared to dante's, but yes, you won't see de niro here
his loss
)
A bit pricey compared to what you would find on Arthur Ave, but Caffe Dante boasts friendly service, a variety of Italian desserts (including cakes imported from Italy), and a convenient SoHo location
The chocolate mousse cake was rich and smooth, but the chocolate mousse by itself was another matter, lumpy - a sign of error in preparation
Despite that, a solid choice for coffee, conversation and cake
The coffee was ok but was taken from us before we had a chance to finish
They were in a rush to get rid of us and when I asked for an explanation I received the rudest response from the manager himself
Even though I was a regular I would never set foot there again
I'd rather give my monet elsewhere
For scrumptious, authentic gelato, Caffee Dante is the only place in NY to go
Neck-in-neck with Eisenberg's Coffee and Sandwich Shop for the best BLT in the city
For $6
50 you get a 12-inch, toasted, BLT hero with herb mayo and plenty of crispy bacon
There's a good reason you'll wait in line to get yours
Watch out when ordering sandwiches here
The pricing system is very weird and you might end up with a very unexpected tab
Got a mediocre turkey on hiro with tomatoes and mustard for $8
00
Ha!
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St
, so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i
e
, surprisingly fresh)
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get
I'd definitely recommend this little place
Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is)
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees
Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother? (or sister, in my case!)
While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees
Food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh
And its absolutely DELICIOUS
Ask any Pakistani/Indian taxi driver to vouch for it as they're the main clientele - and that's how you know you've struck gold
This place is a great bargain

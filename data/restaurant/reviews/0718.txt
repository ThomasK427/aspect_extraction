This is the perfect place to go with friends or on a date, especially if you want to stay close to home or show off your neighborhood
Food was bad for the price (risotto was very bad)
Service was horrible
Also it was very crowded and noisy for the atmosphere
Maybe in times when it's not crowded it is romantic
I live in Astoria
Restraurants in Astoria tend to serve average food in great price
This place serves average food, tiny portion, in high price
I understood that I paid for the deco
I had a horrible experience with my shrimp salad, they charged me a fortune for a plate of greens and ONLY 3 small shrimps
I'll never go back!
We love this place
Food and service are always great
Nice ambiance
However prices are a bit much for Queens and the menu has not been changed in the past 3 years
I'm not sure what some of the recent reviewers were expecting - you want salty food at any restuarant, then sorry, you're probably gonna have to add salt! My wife and I eat here pretty often - it's just down the street, and we're glad to have such a great place so near us
They've got some of the best french toast you'll ever eat for Sunday brunch, and while their dinner menu hasn't changed much in the past few years, their food is reliable and they I always find something new in their chicken or fish specials, which are usually prepared with a red or white wine-based sauce
Everyone I've ever taken here has been impressed, and this in a neighborhood known for great European food
I've not even been to many places in Manhattan better than the Brick Cafe, especially not in this price range
I moved in the Area Several months ago, and could not wait to dine at this restaurant
What a disappointment
I went there with a party of 5
Each dish ordered (all different) was worse than the other
What a mistake! never Again
I don't understand all these good reviews
Maybe it was a new chef, but the food was very mediocre
I never put salt on my food (especially at restaurants) but I used it here
I noticed other people at other tables doing it as well
I had chicken francese and I think they forgot to add the lemon
Out of our party of 3 no ones food was terribly good
The ambiance was very nice though, but you want more out of a restaurant than that
I have no idea what the last reviewer was talking about, I do know why it has such a high rating
The food is good, the service is not bad at all, they are always packed, and everytime I went had no complaints
So trust me, it is worth trying, you will be happy, and you will return
I dont know how it has such a high rating
The food is nothing stupendous, and the service is way below par
Who has ever been to a restaurant that takes your cake to refridgerate it and then refuses to serve your cake after your meal? Not to mention a $400 tab
Will never return again
There are MUCH better restaurants everywhere
Aesthetically it's lovely
The waitress came to our table once for our order, but then we were tended to by who I thought was the hostess
That's okay, but it's hard to judge what tip to leave since we didn't know who it's going to
The food's a wee bit overpriced, but not outrageous
I ordered the Brick salad which was delicious, but I'm not really picky
My husband ordered a hamburger which he loved, and he's picky! The ambiance was relaxing and romantic that I did not want to leave
Excellent for a date
I wouldn't say it would be good for a large group; it's not a big place
The menu is not for the buffalo-wings-for-appetizers type, but I'm sure they'd certainly find something to order
It was pleasantly crowded
We were seated right away, but it was after normal dinner hours
I would absolutely go again
I have not once been disappointed by Brick
The service is wonderful, the food is delicious everytime
I usually order the specials but if not there are at least 5 great dishes that I would choose from any given night
The best SOUP I've EVER tasted anywhere
You must go!!!
If you want Manhattan, stay in Manhattan; this is a great local place with a pretty good wine list and a very talented chef
I don't know that I have ever been disappointed by the standard menu or the specials
If there is a wait, try the lounge area next door
Service can be a bit sketchy and this is not cheap eats, but overall Brick is definitely one of my favorites
If you don't feel like a trek into Manhattan, stay in Astoria and go to Brick
It's a great date place - the food is good but expensive
The atmosphere is romantic
But the service is slow and confusing
And, every time I've walked by, they had a 20-minute waiting list
If I wanted to wait, I'd go into the city and eat at Balthazar's
Good food! Not too fat, no deep fried
is it NY? The food is delicious, healthy, fresh!
Even if Brick wasn't right down the street from me, I'd travel out to Astoria for it! The food really is amazing (and quite unlike anything else in the neighborhood) by any standards, and the ambiance and staff are perfect
I've been to Brick a million times and have never once been disappointed
The penne a la vodka and the chocolate souffle are the best!!!
I normally don't take time to do this kind of thing but after going to Brick I felt I wanted to let them know about my experience
From the minute we walked in to the moment we left it was a great experience
The feel of the place is just perfect-homey, comfortable and relaxing
I tasted several things from the menu b/c there was 6 of us and one thing was better than the next
There were also some pleasantly different things on the menu-foods I'm not used to seeing in Astoria, let alone the US
Whatever your doing please keep it up 'cause I'm definetly coming back
I finally came out to this place from Manhattan
I should have stayed in Manahattan
Loved the decor of the place, however I was waiting for a waitress for about 10 min
Drinks were OK, nothing to rave too much about
A nice crowd was present, and good for a private date
Recently had bridal shower for my sister at Brick Cafe
Great food, cozy space and excellent service
I looked at many other places- this by far was a perfect choice
Looking forward to coming back-keep up the good work
This is a great place to unwind or meet up with friends for drinks in their rear cafe
But their food leaves much to be desired
Everything is smothered in heavy, greasy cheese and oilso much so that you can't taste the food
There's very little on their menu if you're trying to avoid cheese and oil - not many grilled entrees at all
Food can still be prepared creatively and tastefully without being heavy, greasy and salty
You can't even get a simple mixed green or veggie salad
It's also overpriced for the area - at $80 for 2 at dinner, I can do better at many places in the city
Too badthe service and the ambience are wonderful, but they need some new talent in the kitchen
This is no questions asked the best place in Astoria
I was reading some of these rewievs and i don't even know what are you talking about
At least 10 times went there and every single time is the same - Exelent- fod and service
I took my perents last week and i got few phone calls over the weekend, they want to come again to the their new spot
All the best to BRICK CAFE
GREAT JOB

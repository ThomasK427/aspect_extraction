Bring cash!
Just visited Totonno for the first time, the decor was cute and the service was friendly; although my friends and I felt like we were in someone's kitchen, as the personal conversation between employees was loud! I had high expectations based on the other reviews
The pizza was very good, but I still say the best pizza in Brooklyn is found at Ciccio's on West 5th and Ave U
(Close to the N train)
For some reason, this pizzaria didn't seam to make it to the best pizzaria survey, perhaps because of it's location
But the trek is certainly worth it because it's simply the best pizza ever, ever, ever! Made from homemade sauce, fresh mozzeralla cheese, freshly made dough
the freshed ingredients, always
Old Italian style
This place has been here since before my dad was born, right down the block
Before the previous owner past away (current owner's uncle i think), it was only open on weekends, and closed after the dough ran out, 1 hour wait for a pizza was good, and there were no markings on the store to suggest it was even open! Things have improved on all fronts
This is it
Better than any other pie in NYC
A true art form
I am amazed at how unassuming this little whole in the wall pizza joint is considering how utterly magnificent their pies are
Get here
It will probably take you an hour
Maybe two
Completely worth it
If NYC has the best pizza in the world, and Totonno's has the best pizza in NYC
better get in there
What they say is true
There's a lot of great pizza in NYC (and some dreadful pizza too), but this is the best
It's a bit of a trek to walk there, but that just helps you build up an appetite
This place looks like an ice cream shop from the outside but is actually much more
Tony, the owner is extremely friendly and ready to talk about good health
He made me an excellent vegetable juice, and allowed sampling of the tamarind juice and ginger beer
The food I had was also real good - a vegetable patty and some other good vegetarian options - including some real tasty barbecue fake meat
Next time I'll try the ice cream
On any given day when you walk in vee's restaurant it's always packed with customers waiting Hungrily to eat the delicious food that had to be cook with love
the chef is great
when I was in the restaurant I was servrd by kayann (I hope I spell her name right
) She is a dilegent worker, and has sunshine for an attitude I give the chef and kayann 2 tumbs up
vee keep up the good work
Good luck and God bless
Not bad, but not the best
You won't be disappointed in the food
But I would avoid the cheese calzones--to watery
I grew up in the neighborhood and whenever i'm up in new york, i stop by for the canollis and the elephant ears
Egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast is great too!
If you're looking for Caribbean comfort food, you can't do better than one of the Roti Shack's plump, delicious rotis
This is a sensory experience
They look (appetizing), smell (spicy), feel (warmheavy), and taste (divine)! I left out sound because there will be nothing but that familiar silence when you know you're eating some-ting seeer-yuss! Overstand?
Being that I grew up in the neighborhood, my whole childhood all i can remember is San Remo's always being there
And now that i live in Maryland, every time I drive up to New York, this place is the first stop I make to get something to eat
The sauce is the best! I recommend trying a cheese slice, a mozzarella and tomato slice, and for the pasta lovers, try the penne a la vodka! Those are top on my list
Yummy! The guys that work there are great too! Very friendly and personable
The best sicilian i've had in the entire city! It had some of the best sauce on earth, along w/ pretty good cheese
bon appetite!
but of course that's not saying much
The owner and pizza guys are super friendly, and they make some great pasta dinners
But their pizza is top notch, in an area where there isn't a lot to choose from
I have had a lot of cheesecake -- I would even consider myself a expert on cheesecake
Aunt Butchie is the best cheesecake ever, ever, ever
It's almost like having pudding and cheesecake combined -- like chocolate mouse cheesecake
You go Aunt Butchie's
Ive never actually been to Aunt Butchies, so I cant really rate the establishment itself, but I can tell you that the cheesecake that I tasted of theirs was the best ive ever had!!! It was the Raspberry Almond and it was wonderful!! I would greatly recommend them to anyone looking for a great New York style cheesecake!
Mona Lisa has got the BEST pies! I remember buying a Peach Cobbler Pie
My friends and I finished it in one go!
If brick-oven pizza is your thing, then this is the place to go
Their pizza is crisp, a little bit cruncy, and a little bit burnt, just the way I like it
It's also a good place to unwind after dinner and have some coffee and cake
For those with a sweet tooth, they also have a variety of gelato flavors to choose from
I have been going here for 15 years and the food has never been better, stick to the specials of the day and ask for the some recomandations
as for the people whom posted about the salad, I never had it, as for the person that had no sides with the steak, they must have made a mistake, everytime I go its come's with awesome potatoes
I grew up in this neighborhood and patronized it with my family
Tried the homemade lasagna for a goof and was pleasantly surprised
Stuffed veal chop awesome as well
Have taken customers there specifically for the extensive wine selection and no one has ever been disappointed
Wait is sometimes long but I appreciate the color of the staff and the opera singer owner
Heard endless praises of this place from Italian locals
Our car was valet parked our coats checked, we were seated in the BACK of the restaurant
Our waiter took his time taking our drink orders ('97 Italian red was good)
He dropped off a bread basket which we devoured because they took so long bringing the menu
The salad I ordered was nothing special, mushrooms from a can (ew), very bland and served in ugly bowls - no worth $9
I asked for balsamic vinegar, it was acidic and cheap
For dinner I order linguine w/ red clam sauce, the pasta was perfect and the sauce was flavorful but the clams tasted funny so I ate around them
My boyfriend ordered pasta fagioli and loved it
We didn't stay for dessert
The valet guy couldn't be bothered going out in the cold so he just pointed to our car
This had to be the worst dining experience I ever had
We had to wait for almost an hour to be seated
My father's entree was served ten minutes after everyone received their meals and we always had to wait a long time for our drinks
In fact, we never received the last round of drinks we ordered
Our steaks were served plain without any vegeatbles
Who ever heard of steaks served without something on the side? When we complained to the waiter, he brought us burned french fries
The service was lousy and the management was extremely arrogant
Also, the seating was very crammed
Definitely don;t go here with a large party
You'd get a better meal at White Castle
I've been going to this place since I was just a thought in my parents dirty little minds
I've had just about every single momentous occasion in my 35yr long life celebrated here
Always a great time out
The food is as warming and pleasurable as your couch on a rainy sunday afternoon
Tony's gone, sadly Ernie's passed on and now the waiters have corn rows and less finish to their chosen profession but it still maintains it's class and place as a brooklyn landmark
I've had everything and now go for my mood foods
Zuppa di mussels in red sauce, chicken castelli romani, baked clams, fried zucchini, and the list goes on
get a carafe of red and finish with a piece of cheese cake don't over think it
it's just good food
One thing more, Steve if you're reading this PLEASE renovate the bathrooms
They're nasty

She refused to seat us, despite several open tables
We ordered an appetizer at the bar-- two small unflavorful tacos for $10! It was not enough to share
We ordered dinner and again requested to be seated
She said she would seat us only because we were leaving in an hour, despite the open tables
In less than an hour, they cleared our table
They took away our chips and guacamole before we were finished eating
They broke the glass of my friend's drink before she had finished it and didn't offer her another or to take it off the bill
Cafe Frida is NOT worth the money or the headaches! The quality of the food and drinks is average, if that, and the ambiance is forced
What a rip-off!
I was meeting 3 friends on 1/28; I arrived at 6:30 and asked if they could accommodate us (leaving by 8:15) no answer
At 7 we ask for a table (again), they begrudgingly agree, warning us that at 8 they need the table back (Weve already spent $60 - squeezed at bar
) 10 minutes later were seated in the empty restaurant
Another 10 minutes a waiter arrives
I ask for the check at 8:10; they immediately clear our table forks in mid-air; taking unfinished cocktail breaking glass 5 from my hand! No apologies from the staff 4 giving us rude, unfocused service nor an offer for a complimentary cocktail due to crap service
I worked on the floor of a restaurant for 2 years and now work for a leading restaurant magazine - this is not how service should flow
We went to Cafe Frida during Mexican restaurant week as well, they explained to us that the organizers of the so called Mexican week had done a really poor job (we had gone to other Mexican restaurants and we were told the same story)
Whoever organized the resaturant week made a mistake with the dates
We stayed and we had a BLAST!, GREAT FOOD, SERVICE and they even gave us a round of driks on the house
We consider is fair to explain this
We are coming back this week end already
Gracias muchos!
If you are in the mood for Mexican and want to eat on the UWS with friends, great setting and good food
A little pricey, but it is great place
We went as a group to celebrate and we had a great time
The big plus for this restaurant is the food - interesting food concept, good flavors, and good food presentations
On the other hand, the cocktail drinks need extra attention and charge a lot for it, waiting service is slow and you still pay for it
The space is tight, crowded and noisy and not suitable for accomodating large groups of people
Just celebrated my b'day there
The best idea ever! Everybody was just amazing, the guacs were the best and the mojitos better than in Cuba
Good pices
Love you guys! We'll be back this week
On the 1st true Spring Saturday, we all decided that sitting, drinking margaritas, and eating guac was the best idea
This was the wrong place
After being treated like we were at Nobu by the hostess, our waitress brought us our check before we even asked for it and denied us a 2nd round of drinks because
they had a reservation coming
There were 3 other tables open and they chose to ask us to leave! Talk about uptight! NEVER AGAIN! Ruined a perfect NYC spring day with friends
Excellent Mexican food--great guacamole, excellent entres--and generous portions too, very friendly and helpful service, great and interesting desserts
Also--a delicious, generous margarita
Would definitely go back!
I visited this place a few weeks ago w/ a friend and had a great time - good place for conversations with friends, the bartender was really friendly we ate at the bar - they make the guacamole right in front of you and it tastes great you have to try this place if just for the guacamole and margaritas
Outstanding food at Cafe Frida! If you're looking for elegant true Mexican food, this is the place
This is not Tex-Mex or the American version of Mexican - this is the real deal
The tacos al pastor rival any we've ever had anywhere, and the margaritas are mixed perfectly! Thank you for our short vacation
The highlight of my meal here was my ice cold, bottled Pacifico
Cafe Frida is one of the lesser restaurants on the UWS
It tries to be something that it is not
It should stick to the traditional (albeit uninventive) Americanized tex-mex instead of venturing into culinary innovation gone awry
The fish dishes all seem to contain the requisitie fish plus a side of rice and a vegetable (or even fruit)
The problem is that none of the flavors are complementary
sliced citrus and tomato sauce? When I told the waitress I wasn't a big fan of corn, she recommended a fish dish that was filled with it
The floor is cold, the seats are uncomfortable and frankly it is not worth the price
Money better spent elsewhere
I'd walked by a hundred times, seen the tableside guacamole, and thought, well
the ratings are decent, I guess it's worth a try
But there are a lot of better options in the city (Mexican Radio, Mexicana Mama, Mi Cocina, Alma) and even on the UWS (Calle Ocho)
Service was OK, though a bit disingenuous
The server advised us to get dishes that sounded a bit stretched and turned out to be so
For example: Grapefruit slices on tomato base, Vegetarian enchiladas filled with a pre-fab side dish that turned up on someone else's plate, and bland fish and lamb dishes dressed up with nuevo-latino flourishes
Overall, the menu is stretched in too many directions and mediocre even at the 15-20 entree price
Spend a few dollars on transportation out of the neighborhood if you want good mexican
A great place to go for a low-key dinner and drinks which promises good quality contempo Mexican food, courteous staff, and charming ambience
Not usually crowded on weekdays or weekends
Try the chipotle pork tacos and strawberry margaritas - yum!
This is one of the best Mexican Restaurants in New York
I am originally from CA and have a hard time coming by something so authentic
Hooray for the Guacamole and the Sangria
great place to get a yummy meal
was surprised at the quailty of the food in such a small, charming place
great made to order guac! will be back
Went for brunch yesterday for the first time, though had previously dined at Isabella's for dinner and loved it
Brunch did not disappoint at all
though this is quite a popular spot, the wait was not too long
Great food, service, indoor and outdoor dining options (outdoors is great for brunch) and proximity to the park
This place is great
My boyfriend and I went there for our first date two years ago and ever since we have been going back, and going back, and going back! The bread basket is really great
The tuna is wonderful! Goat cheese salad with walnuts is very light and a great starter
I personally like to sit by the window when they have it all open - but in the winter I love sitting upstairs because it feels more secluded (my preference)
LOVE IT!
Best value and fabulous food
Every time I go I order the eggs benedict which comes with home fries and an alcoholic beverage
The Bloody Mary is perfect and the basket of breakfast breads is a great starter
This is my favorite brunch spot and the only place worth the wait
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Upper West Side because of it's great service and wonderful food
The wait staff is great, leaving you feeling attended to but not cloying
The only problem is getting a table, so make sure to make a reservation
My friends and I went to Isabella's during our recent trip to NYC
We usually go there several times a year but this year the food (the bass) and service were exceptional
Our dinner was excellent, the staff was wonderful
Our waitress, I think her name was Megan was very helpful and kept the drinks coming
This was one of our best dining experiences in NYC
We will absolutely come back again
My boyfriend and I recently had dinner at Isabella's
We both agreed that the food was decent but that the service was just terrible
We had to wait 30-45mins after we were already seated to get our orders in, waited what felt like an hour to get our food, was not given utensils with our dinner (had to wait for that too), and had the wrong dessert brought to our table and never remedied even after we brought it to the waiter's attention
We're normally 20%+ tippers but that night was the first time we actually gave less than 10%
Outrageous, overrated, and definitely not recommended
We made the compulsory Saturday night reservation for a birthday dinner and were not disappointed
The restaurant is an oasis from the hectic life outside
Our choice of a table on the second floor was perfect for a quieter, leisurely dinner
It was available on time, the staff was pleasant and unobtrusively attentive

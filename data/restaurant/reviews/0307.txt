I came on sunday night with my parents to have some moroccan food in new york
My mom was so happy she had been IDeed by the doorman
A super pretty hostess suggested to my dad a very nice table by the terrasse and we decided to seat at the entrance
We had a french waiter who was so nice and so professional, the food was great and they have a very extensive wine list from all over the world (you can even ask you waiter to suggest you wines that are not on the list)
As we were having dinner more and more people were coming, le souk is very trendy beautiful girls did not stop calling our waiter as well as the music started to pump up the place
Enjoy!
I'm a french student, and since I've been in NYC (one month), The Souk is the best place I have ever gone
There are four main rooms, which are all different and present an unseen gathering ambiance
People are convivial, service is fast and the place is full of beautiful girls
The design is original, lightnings are slight, and the music is just amazing
Definitively a place to be !!!!!  And, most of all, prices are really inexpensive which rare for such a place in Manhattan
You must go there !!
one of the most amazing nights was last friday when i went there for the1st time me and my friends to celebrate my fiance's birthday , the place is very exotic, i loved the style, the lamps, tables, chairs, the decor is totally gorgeous!! the service was excellent, that was Shakira who served us, a very nice waitress that looks like shakira!the food was good but not as expected to be, the flavored hookas were great and the music was amazing! so check out le souk that very exotic place let the exoctic shakira serve u and be ready for an unforgettable experience in le souk!!!!! for all readers if u wanna go to le souk go there after 11, cause the place get very crowded and go there only for drinks cause the food is not that tasty! overall, its a nice place , nice staff and wonderful ambience!
I invited 32 people and all of them decided to plan a party at Le Souk
This place is ideal, the food is great and the service is very helpfull and strong, they defenetly know what they are doing
Belly dancers enchanted the room and some of my guests start dancing so we decided to stay
We moved to another room of the restaurant inspired by the music and the vibe
We stayed all night drinking, dancing and loving the party
The place is so beautifull and ready for a top service from dinner to late night
Thank you
The attitude from the staff was so unbelievable that I was moved to share my experience with other new yorkers
The lines were long
The door man thought he was working at the Marquee
The hostess charged us $400 for 6 people
It was over crowded
The mixed drinks were over $10 and suffered from a lack of alcohol! I will never be going back even though I live on that block
The staff needs to be reminded that we new york offers many options!
last friday i was forced to go to le souk for the birthday of a relative that was flying from beverly hills
I indeed noticed that the attitude of the new staff complitely changed
I can't believe that they were that nice and so helpfull in the description of the different new dishes added to the menu
I am so glad retrieving one of my favorite place inn the city after so much time
Her birthday was a total success we had dinner wonderfull wine from all over the world we smoke the shisha, few belly dancers appears and start dancing all over the rooms
Fantastic experience
Thank you
I heard that a new French cordon bleu is taking care of Le Souk Kitchen he used to cook for the king of Morocco and few of his friends including french president Jacques CHirac
I went there with my wife looking for a venue to celebrate my birthday
As soon as i entered in the place i felt like home, we been taking care very quickly, the service was excellent and the food was delicious
In the back of the restaurant they have that beautifull Riad that reminded me Casablanca
The atmosphere and the music are very pleasant and they have enough space to hosts the group of people that i wanted to bring for dinner
You should try
This is a truly wonderfull restaurant that turns into a club in the later hours
The cuisine is northern african
The place has a perfect harem room decoration, and even waterpipes can be ordered giving the place a nice apple smell
This place is seriously not worth your time -- at all
My friend waited 30 minutes and when he finally got to the front of the line was simply told that he is not coming in because he is not with a girl, keep in mind my friend is an absolute stud
When asked why he wasn't told about this policy (while waiting for the past 30 minutes), the girl in the front with the clipboard had no answer
So essentially, if you are a single guy you are not allowed into a little filthy hookah restaurant which is overpriced and overhyped
We agree that we have NEVER encountered a staff as rude -- this establishment has no class and runs a poor business
It is just a matter of time before people catch on to the fact that this place is pure junk
I went to Le Souk last night with two of my old high school friends and we had a terrific experience
We were given the option of sitting on the bed which is fabulous but we declined since we thought it might be uncomfortable to sit on
However we sat in the booth right next to the bed in the lounge which is a great area to sit and we enjoyed the music, the hookah, the drinks and the food was a delicacy
Also the waitstaff was very cordial even when they were extremely busy
We recommend Le Souk for a good time any night of the week
I come to le souk for all occasions
Recently I was there having a dinner party with my girlfriends and had a great time
The food was great and so were the hookas
We sat in the lounge by the bed and enjoyed several differnt belly dancers throughout the night
Le Souk offers its customers an array of annemities; great music, great ambiance; and great service, a msut go for anyone out of town
I had a great time and would reccomned this venue tio anyone
We celebrated a friend's birthday here and while everyone agreed the food was great, the undeniably rude service would prevent any of us (a group of 10) from ever coming back again
Our server simply had an attitude, for reasons we'll never know
We were squeezed together even though we had reserved enough tables, we were rushed through the meal, and even rushed out of the restaurant - they had another party booked at our table, and clearly hadn't allowed enough time in between
The bill was a bit of a shock, as we discovered how much the watery pitchers of sangria cost us, but the ultimate insult was the waitress accusing us of shorting the nearly $700 bill by $20
If she would have counted it out one more time (as we did, right in front of her), she would have realized that the amount given her was correct
This place just sucks
The most obnoxious and rude staff u can ever come accross
Unless ur a party over 6 expecting to shell out a bomb, u'll be treated like crap
Seriously
just crap
The waitresses act like they're doing u a favor
Hookahs are overcharged for
and u can forget requesting a coal change
its against their policy
Overall a horrible and hulimiating experience
A DEFINTE NO!!!!
Very Rude/Obnoxious Staff/waited forever for food and drinks
When requested a hookah bar
we were ignored for 1/2hr to be told that they were tooo busy to accommodate us and not to forget by their rude manager
What's the point of offering a hookah bar? The total experience SUCKED!!! Definitely, NOT a restaurant you would want to take a date or if you are trying to impress someone!!!
Wait staffs are very unprofessional and rude
Service was extremely slow
My friends and I had dinner and wanted to smoke hookah, but, was asked rudely to leave our dinner table because we did not order hookah before dinner
One of the worst dinning experience I have ever had in NYC!
I have been going out to Le Souk for 3 years, especially because of the Sundays, which feature great techno
I have tolerated the fact that the place is packed on weekends, pricey and not that great drinks, often poor music on Saturdays, and bottle service that is slowly turning into a must
Back in the day, this place could boast with the most polite door personnel in NYC, but as of recently they hired some guys that are below even NYC standards
On the evening before the Labor Day, my party (3 ladies + 2 guys!) was literally removed from the line because we refused 200$ bottle service, although we were ready to wait until there was more space inside
At this point, there are enough masochists for the place to make profits, but such poor culture will soon put an end to this place
I have gone out to 'Le Souk' for last 3 years: Sundays are best, thanks to great techno by AstroGlide
It gets packed on weekends, with expensive drinks and sometimes bad music on Saturdays, but used to have the most polite bouncers in NYC
However, my experience was worse and worse each time: more packed, people being pushed aside to make place for the ones who bought the bottle service, etc
On Sunday, 9/3/2005, we encountered all new bouncers - rude and arrogant
When our turn came to get in, we were told that the place was full due to the Labor Day weekend and we could not get inside unless we bought a 200$ bottle of vodka
That was simply preposterous for a place which is not even a club
As we decided to wait until there was more space inside, bouncer got upset and ordered us to leave!!!
sangria for 50 bucks???? are you kidding me????? And with that service, I would never go
Trully Le Sucks!!!!!
Le Souk is like any other pretentious place in New York that offer both food and dance but for a price that may be hefty for some
The decor and food are excellent for the Middle Eastern / North African theme they are presenting, which dark yet enchanting

50 you get the picture
Food Quality: The skirt stake had not been trimmed, chunks of fat dripped from the edge, it also had a strong cumin flavor
The grass fed sirloin was fairly tender and properly cooked, if it wasnt for the heavy rosemary aroma that permeated it and hid the flavor of the meat it would have been enjoyable
A true Argentine restaurant? Not
Coming from South America and growing up eating absolutely delicious and mesmerizing Argentinean steak, I would say that this place has pretty good meat
I recommend it to anyone who would want to try this place
Yet, what really got me was the decor, very old and typical of its area type of setting; very beautiful
Great cozy place!  Steak by weight, fresh meat, awesome decor, warm atmosphere and appropriate service
A romantic night may be somewhat ruined by loud corporate parties but usually it feels very comfortable and warm
Nice wine list and a friendly bar
A must for a steak lover!
Happening in one evening, the place was bustling
Only table was a shared one, and we agreed
The ambiance was nice, yet on this table was a big candle spilling quantities of wax on our table
Of the dish I ordered, it didn't arrive as listed, and after a query the waiter told me it was what I ordered
Checking again, he told me they were outof the high end item on the dish, so substituted cheap chorizos instead
They knew I was miffed, but the waiter was a tad rude
My dish was weak with raw shortribs and a crappy shish-ke -bob
House wine is $12 per glass, so watch out
The couple across us on the communal table was aghast when their check arrived with $72 for the 3 glasses of red they each had
I think I arrived on a bad night for the kitchen
Went there last night for a special dinner with family
First there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant
She was good but obviously overwhelmed
Secondly, the steaks on the menu can only be ordered by the ounce
For a 10 OZ filet, I paid $25
50
It was very tender but not a great value
It does not come with anything, so you have to pay another $5 for their limited choice of side orders
Also my glass of wine cost $12
For one glass! I guess that's part of the restaurant's strategy- to get you to spend more money! When the check came out to $100 for two and my mom didn't even have an entree
I'm glad we didn't! Skip it, try a Le Steak for a better value and great filet mignon on the Upper East Side
Pros: None  Cons: Overpriced, Understaffed, Loud Music

We wanted steak, to stay on the UES, to try something new
we stumbled across Hacienda de Argentina are delighted that we decided to give it a try
The ambiance, service, and food were top notch
So romantic! With only 9 tables beautiful decor - you feel like you are in your own living room
The wine list is spectacular with full descriptions of each wine
The hostess was very knowledgable allowed us to enjoy our meal without feeling neglected
We shared the Ensalada Especial Empenadas de Queso Y Salchicha each had our own Lomo a la Argentina with a side of humita
(What a great idea to allow you to order your steak by the ounce
) We shared a banana crepe for dessert which was the perfect ending to our fabulous meal
Everything was amazing and i would highy recommend you try it!
On Father's Day, my husband and I took my parents to this restaurant to celebrate the holiday
It was the worst experience ever! In the beginning, nobody even gave us any menus
We had to get up and get the wine menu ourselves
After we ordered the wine, we still haven't received the food menu
We waited for about 30 minutes to get the menu
Then another 30 minutes for our waiter to take our order
They were obviously understaffed because of the long wait
And then, 30 minutes later, I saw a table who was seated after we were seated and they were eating their appetizers! We didn't even get OUR appetizers! I understand if they were short on staff but serving another table who arrived after us was just unprofessional and frustrated us even more
So we ended up leaving the restaurant
What a gem
Food was really good(get the natural sirloin), the staff worked well with eachother to make it feel like my table was the only table in the restaurant(though there are only 9) The manager was very helpful in helping me choose just the right wine and the bartender was nice trying to help me select my single malt after my meal
On the UES, this breath of fresh 'Argentine air is a welcome change from googies and the cookie cutter Italian joints
Do however plan for a meal that is cooked to order(takes a little bit of extra time) but worth the wait and be sure to make reservations
I was lucky to get a table without one, but a couple after me was not and were not
The ambiance is beautiful, although cold and too dark
Beautiful furniture, but the round dinner tables have a lip that make them uncomfortable
The Service was good for a California Restaurant; Too sticky!!! Nobody is Argentine there so they know little about the food
The side dishes are small for what you pay, and the grilled provolone looks like a V--it!  Definitely not Argentine! The buss-boys are great the soda is flat and over all Very Expensive 3 people nowine no dessert $160!!!
I have been a steak lover all of my life, but the meats and the food in general that my friends and I had at Hacienda de Argentina in our two visits in the last three weeks has being as good as any meat eaters dream come true
I had been waiting for some time for it to open
I lived next door and saw the work ongoing
This is a great addition to the Upper East side mix of restaurants
Geraldine will make sure that your meal is great
We had empanadas and the veal meatballs for an appetizer
The skirt steak and parrillo mix were fabulous
For dessert go with the flan as the chocolate cake was not too moist
It looks like an old castle with romantic hints such as candelabras, mirrors and small plants
Get here quick before it starts getting crowded
The Scene The white-washed interior of the bi-level space feels like an exclusive beachside hacienda, especially in the second-floor dining room, which always seems filled with light
Palm trees sculpted onto the walls, lazy fronds spinning from the tall, angled ceiling and arched doors leading to an outdoor terrace add to the "on-vacation" vibe for a mix of midtown suits and funkier food lovers
The Food Chef-owner Richard Sandoval applies his chile collection so skillfully that he never masks the essential flavors of each fish
An improbably delicate chipotle and manchego cheese sauce gracefully embraces shrimp and bay scallops, and refreshing cubes of salmon tread above the citrus-habanero sting in the ceviche marinade
Whole red snapper arrives like a seafood sculpture, artfully de-boned, rounded out, stuffed with tangy cactus salad and surrounded with a chile de arbol lake
But most impressive is crispy, guajillo-enhanced pan-seared pampano, which is worthy of the restaurant's good name
In terms of food, the ceviche is truly outstanding
We had the 4 ceviche sampler and all 4 were great
The entrees, however, don't measure up
The signature dish is the whole red snapper, but the component parts didn't mesh together well, leaving basically a very nice piece of fish accompanied by mixed vegetables rather than a unified, cohesive dish
The swordfish was good, but not outstanding, and for the prices we had expected better
With that out of the way, we won't be going back to Pampano for reasons other than the food
We had arrived early for our reservation and had a drink at the bar, and when we went to be seated the hostess hemmed and hawed before offering us a table downstairs
We indicated that we would rather sit upstairs, which is by far nicer, and the hostess hung her head in shame and directed us upstairs, where there was plenty of seating throughout the course of our meal
The hostess acted like a kid caught with her hand the cookie jar--she clearly knew that she had tried to do something she shouldn't have done and that we had caught her
Worse still, it was completely pointless
The restaurant just isn't that crowded
Why try to treat customers with poorly when it isn't necessary? Just silly and unprofessional, and enough to keep us away from Pampano in the future

For only being open 6 nights, it was unbelievable
The place is beautiful, spacious, modern, yet warm
The food was beyond good
Try anything from the wood-burning oven
The chicken fried duck livers were perfect, and I loved the whole porgy fish
All the desserts we had were great, my favorite was the lemon-verbena granita
Service was so on target, attentetive professional
I think it is one of the best restaurants to open in a while
Go while you can get in
Given that Cookshop is owned by the folks behind Five Points, one of my favorite NYC restaurants, I had high hopes for it -- which, unfortunately, were only partially met
I know I probably shouldn't expect a restaurant that's been open all of three days to have its act fully together, but the (admittedly friendly) service was a bit of a joke -- first courses served before the wine had arrived and all that
I also have to question the acoustics, since you'd think restaurant owners would've figured out by now that concrete floors and high ceilings make for a constant, irritating din and conversations held at near-shouting level
The food is really quite amazing though, so at least they got that part right
DEFINITELY get the spiced fries; they're wonderfully tasty, and you get a huge basket of them (practically a meal in itself!) for $6
I spent the last school year working and living in Turkey, so I'm very familiar with Turkish cuisine, and this place had it down perfectly
I couldn't believe how tiny the dining room was and there was only a curtain between us and the kitchen, but the food was delicious and our waiter couldn't have been nicer
We had the sigara boregi and the falafel for appetizers- both hit the spot
The cheese inside the sigara boregi was melted to perfection
The main courses were as equally appeting , especially the meat casserole, which was huge (I was still a little hngry after finishing my kofte dish)
I was just in Istanbul this summer and loved the food there
101 Restaurant brought me right back to Istanbul
Everything tasted authentic and it was a really great, romantic dinner
I had the doner and girlfriend had the adana kebap
They were both amazing
I would highly recommend checking this place out soon
They have only been open for five months or so, and it's still BYOB
There was no one else there when I ate there, but once the secret is out I think this place will be full every night of the week
It should be
101 is an original turkish restaurant where you can get your hands on to a real turkish taste in new york
very similar to what you can find in istanbul
although very small, it's clean, simple and you get tasty turkish dishes at reasonable prices
they deliver too
This small place (seats only 16) features delicious food and a warm, friendly atmosphere
The hummus was quite fresh and tasty; we also enjoyed the zucchini pancakes
Entrees were also cooked perfectly
Our dessert was excellent also
This is a great value-less than $50 total for two people
They've only been open for 3 months-go soon, because I think when the word gets out there will be a line out the door! Also-they don't have a liquor license yet, so you can bring your own bottle of wine or buy one from the store down the street
THIS IS HOW THE FOOD TASTES IN ISTANBUL
i must say as an ameriturk who has been living outside of Turkey for 15 years i have not eaten in a Turkish restaurant that offers Incredibly original flavors; not only for 1 dish but the whole menu
prices are so reasonable that enables you to taste the whole menu if u want
place is small but everyone is friendly
during the day it is more like a fast food style but in the evening mood changes to a intimate dinning atmosphere
i dont think this place could stay as a hidden gem so try now b4 it becomes way too crowded popular
excelent option for take away or delivery
A cute little spot with a wonderful selection of turkish specialties
We were completely taken by suprise as we loved the food, whether it was the freshly made Imam Bayaldi (an eggplant appetizer stuffed with tomatoes, pine nuts and currants) or the delicious shishs (the lamb shish was very very tasty!)
Then of course, we had to finish with a little treat - the Baklava was just perfect
The place is small but it is definitely worth it
A friend of mine took me to this tiny Turkish restaurant where she ate before
I was positively impressed by almost everything here
The food is really wonderful
Having tried most of the Turkish places in the city, I'd gladly vouch for the food at 101
Salads and appetizers are fresh and very tasty, but the meat is definitely the best I've ever had in a Turkish restaurant in New York
Prices are reasonable, ambiance is cozy chich, and the service is friendly
I usually get disappointed when comparing different countries kitchens homeland states with their offshore presences
I mean until last week
At a Turkish restaurant named 101, newly opened in Manhattan, I experienced how a kitchen of a country could preserve its pure originality
Actually this originality is very important
The ones dealing with meals prefer to change the original recipes as to the place they are locating in
I do not think that they ask for the ideas of customers while making these changes
Obviously, eating these meals made of these clever (!) changes seems like watching a basketball game played with a soccer ball
The Turkish meals I ate at 101 were exactly the same with the meals I ate in Turkey, especially doner and adana kebap, besides in a way I have not seen in the Turkish restaurants I visited during my previous stays in NY
I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!!!! If I could eat Chipotle every day, trust me when I say that I would
Whenever I dont know what to eat I quickly turn to Chipotle because I know that I cant go wrong; with the prices nor the food
I must admit you might cross some people that work there and arent the friendliest, but everyone knows that no matter where you go you are always going to find at least one person that brings the rating for a certain restaurant or hot spot a couple of notches down
I have came to the location in Herald Square many times, and a couple of time I have gotten a ''complimentary'' meal
It was very thoughtful
First time was because I had to wait for the chicken and the second time was just because
:) If you havent eaten here then you should definitely find a location and try, I'll bet you get addicted
I have been to three shabu shabu joints in the city, (and that probably covers all of them
almost) and this tops them all by far on multiple levels
First off, you get free bubble tea with your food
Second, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is straight out of a Kubrick film, which is cool cause most hot pot places I went to were very boring and drab
Thirdly, the food is fresh, and the table set up for the hot pots somehow makes this usually very messy method of eating very clean
If you want shabu shabu, go here and you will be happy
Oh, and yes, your food arrives quickly
I had my birthday there
My friend made a reservation for 20 people then 22 came
We occupied the whole downstairs section (downstairs has 7 table, about 24 seats)
The food is great, fresh and taste
I had a lot of fun
We went there yestergay for college union
That place was rock!! Food was perfect!!And i loooooooooooooove their bubble milk tea!!oh~tasted like heaven!!!!service was great as well !waiters wore smille all the time!  i am soooooooooooooo ganna go!
go early for seating if you have a group (more than 6), we had a table downstairs with great service
waiters were very attentive, and they have a variety of sauces on the side
and bubble tea!
By far this is definitely the BEST Shabu Shabu place in NYC! Being a Shabu Shabu geek, i have tried numerous in the city and this one certainly is on the top of my chart
Definitely has earned my respect just on my first visit! The restaurant serves wide array of vegetables, meat and seafood, and they are really really fresh! It's also a great diet for those who are concerned about carbs and oil and grease
This is definitely healthy and you get to mix your own dip and sauce, so fun! It also has a Bubble Tea department which gets me excited everytime i am there, definitely order the Tricolor Tofu Pudding in GreenTea with tapiocal pearls! So yummy~! *drool* Service is pretty prompt and the serve team is highly energetic, ready to help any customer with any requests - i m certainly impressed!
The first thing that caught my eye was the long line outside Quickly Sabu Shabu
This is the first time that i've seen a bubble tea and shabu shabu place with a red velvet line rope infront of their resturant
The tapioca bubbles is perfectly done, soft and chewy
Definitely one of the very best in New York
The Shabu Shabu is a real delight
You'll get the nice culterly and classy dishes that is very unusual in Chinatown
Their shabu shabu is one of the tastliest, not to mention the very unique kim-chi soup
Yum
The service staff is eager to please
Another anomaly for a chinatown resturant

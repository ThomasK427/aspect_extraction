My friends and I had the good fortune to happen upon this place and absolutely loved it
The food was delicious, we had a smoked chicken wrap, sirloin steak sandwich and caesar salad and all were very good
The drinks are also very reasonably priced
Great atmosphere too
We'll definitely be back!
The Scene This bustling, energetic little corner restaurant is a pleasure, particularly for those lucky enough to snag one of the bar stools facing the kitchen, where chef and part-owner Andy Nusser leads in a remarkably well-choreographed dance
The room is compact: Tables are right next to each other, leaving just enough space for squeezing in and out
Service is knowledgeable, efficient and, with the exception of the brisk welcome at the door, pleasant
The Food The tapas here are the real deal--brightly flavored and distinctive
They rise to greatness via careful preparation and fine ingredients
A trio of poached egg, roasted potatoes and Mojama--salt-cured tuna that resembles and tastes like cured ham--is spot-on; even brussels sprouts--simply grilled--are memorable
Other dishes show a hint of extra inspiration: Charred-rare wild boar is transformed by a squiggle of honey
Palate-refreshing tangerine sorbet topped with muscato and pomegranate seeds is an exceptional finish
Certainly a trip to Spain! The service was prompt and extremely helpful when suggesting what to eat, size of meals, and the wines that would accompany your food best
The restaurant is fairly small making tables very close with just enough room for the staff to get by
I certainly recommend the Mussels, Calamari, - and the Dorado was absolutely delicious! Definitely a great date spot or even to treat yourself to dinner with a friend from out of town- Def make reservations
The wine is a bit pricey but certainly worth it
Authentic spanish cuisine which makes you feel like you just left Europe! A+!
Being fans of Mario, and having frequented other Mario restaurants, my wife and I decided to check out Casa Mono on a Saturday night
We did not make reservations, and we knew that it was a small place, but we figured 'what the heck
' As we approached the hostess station, we were greeted with a great amount of contempt by the Ice Queen of Irving Plaza at the front door
Despite the fact that there were several tables and bar seats open, we could not possibly be seated for an hour
Well, Saturday night, small restaurant, no big deal
The Ice Queen took our mobile number and assured us she would ring us when they have two seats available
Sure enough, close to an hour later, we got the call and were given two seats at the 'wine bar
' We each had two plates of food and a few glasses of wine, and even made friends with one of the cooks who later bought us a glass of sherry
A few weeks later we tried to pop in again, this time on a Sunday evening
We were again greeted by the Ice Queen, were told that we couldn't possibly be seated for two and a half hours, and were were sure we really wanted to eat there? We told her yes, gave our mobile number, but then decided that we really didn't want to wait over two hours and headed elsewhere
Roughtly 45 minutes later we received the call saying our seats were ready, but we had already left the area and were forced to turn them down
The moral of the story is: Great wine list
Decent food - a good chance to try small portions of uncommon foods (sweetbreads, tripe, etc)
A holier-than-thou hostess who tries to dissuade you from your desire to actually eat there
Rude service - we were told we had to be out of our seats in hour and had to order at least two items - Waiter just seemed as though he'd rather be elsewhere
Greasy - pure layer of inedible fat, lamb spare ribs, when we complained we were told that's just the nature of them - Well, Casa Mono and Mario should not be serving them at any price, let alone $16! Cod fish crouqettes were bland, more like potato fingers, and were only saved by the orange flavored mayo, rabbit was over salted and chopped in pieces that had bone fragments clinging to the breading - should I go on??
Good wine, good food
Lively atmosphere with an open kitchen
Service was fine
A little noisy, a little pricey for small plates
Went here on a Friday night and the food and service could not have been better
Try the quail egg and the lamb chops
The wine selection is also incredible
So many wines for all different prices
It's small and cozy just like a little neighborhood restaurant should be
i live around the corner and have eyed this restaurant since it opened but it always seemed too crowded for me
a friend and i were walking to my house around 2pm today and we saw that the restaurant was practically empty so we dicided to give it a try
first, the hostest insisted on seating us at a table that had to be pried away from another already occupied table even though there were 2 empty tables right next to it
second, we sat down and then sat there for 10 minutes completely ignored with no menu or water
when the food came it was fine
i could have done without all of the waitstaff's formality if it meant that the strainer they brought me for my tea would not have had old dried tea leaves in it from the last user
not going back
A friend of mine and I had a late dinner here on Friday night
We didn't have reseravations, so we didn't mind being seated at almost 11 pm- the hostess was very friendly and apologetic about the hour
What was truly obnoxious was our waiter
The entire menu is in spanish, and even as an experienced NYC foodie there were several items on the menu that I didn't recognize
When I tried to point this out to the waiter in a friendly and humored way, he glared back and made us pick and choose which items we would have the privilege of having translated
The plates are also too expensive for what you get- much better tapas at other places in the city
Not worth the attitude
Don't listen to the hype! the food is definatly over-rated
I guess I expected too much when I knew that M
Batali's name was grazed all over the restaurant
The food was BELOW average and the space is extremely small and uncomfortable
The tables were so close I was able to hear my neighbors comments on the food and not to my surprise they too felt the same, the food was definatly BLAH
DO not order the Mono Salad w/manchego cheese
the cheese couldn't save the salad, the dressing is horrible
do not order the pumpkin croquette,it's leaves an undesirable taste in your mouth
Do not order the fried duck egg, they are trying to charge you 15 dollars for 1 fried egg over 2 slices of potato's and 3 small slices of italian ham
The Calamari was just tasted like salt, yes salt that's it
no calamari
just salt
Babbo yes!Casa Mono,Hell no never again!
Fabulous experience
great service, great food, great ambiance
a must visit for anyone who hasn't been yet
The food is unique and interesting without trying too hard and just plain great! We ordered 5 small plates and a bottle of wine for the 2 of us and it was perfect
duck egg with mojama was our favorite
but all of the plates were wonderful
I took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner
We had to wait about 30-45 mins even though we had a reservation but we went around the corner and got a bottle of wine (which they bring back around to your table when it's ready) and the bartender made a great recommendation for us
While we weren't thrilled about waiting so long, once we were seated the waitress apologized and promptly brought over a plate of carpaccio for us on the house, which was a nice gesture
Our food was outstanding and it was a great date
My favorite neighborhood spot to go with a date
Recommendation: put your name on the list for bar seating then walk around the corner to grab a drink at the W as you wait for them to call your cell
The food is excellent (par with my experience in Barcelona) and who doesnt love cava :-)
Great date place--place is very small/intimate and dimly lit
Can go with friends too but seems more of a date place
Food was great
Had the skirt steak which was excellent
Dinner for 2 with wine came out to less than 80 bucks (we had 4 tapas dishes) w/o tip
would go again, but make sure u rsvp! this place gets packed! Service was friendly and prompt
Recently ate there on a lazy Sunday afternoon
The food lived up to expectations, the tripe, croquettes and razor clams all wise choices
Service could have been a bit more attentive, wasn't around to refill champagne but sometimes not a bad thing when on a quiet afternoon date
Would definitely go back
Better with a group of four so you could try more dishes as they really make this place!!
My friend and I just had lunch at Casa Mono--we were surprised to be the only guests in the dining room when we arrived for our lunch reservation at 12:15 pm on a Wednesday
The food was all delicious and well served
We particularly liked the skirt steak, the duck, and the guinea hen
The chocolate cake for dessert was great too
It isn't cheap, but we found it to be a great spot for a quick and delicious meal
The service was good, but again the dining room remained nearly empty throughout the lunch hour

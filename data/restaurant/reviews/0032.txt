This will be our first stop next time in NYC
Try the ribeye steak it was delicious
We had always heard so much about Jekyll and Hyde but never tried it before
I am so glad that we did
It is so much fun from the first moment you enter the door
I felt like I was in the Haunted Mansion in Disney World and Twlight Zone Tower of Terror and Rockin Roller Coaster all in one
What a show! 4 different floors all with their owncool things going on
My kids favourite was the Seance show in the Library
We really enjoyed our food too! I had a veggie burger, my wife had teh salmon and my kids had pizza and chicken fingers
All was good and hot and vey large portions
I can not say enough great things about this place
Horrible rude staff and manager, lousy food, none of the entertainment was at all up to par
we waited 2 hours for our food and were treated terribly
I would never take my family there ever again
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!
Not recommended! The best part of our night was the small cup of hot chocolate that we received while waiting in line to get into the restaurant
Our waiter was terrible
He should have taken the time to write down the orders, then maybe we would have actually received what we ordered
My boyfriend received a different drink than what he ordered
I received potato chips instead of the french fries I ordered
My boyfriend's burger bun was so soggy he couldn't eat it
It took forever to get anything you asked for
The place wasn't clean
If you sit in the Attic section, you miss all of the good shows that are going on below you
The actors try to draw your attention away from the better stuff that is happening below
The are very loud while you're trying to eat, and the lights are constantly flashing
Listen, if you have kids and arent a stick in the mud type this place is a total blast
If you are expecting gourmet food, or you are an adult on a date
what the hell are you doing here
The food is adequate, but its made up in fun and a great staff
You dont go here for some great NYC meal
you go for fun and to watch your kids
The place is a lot of fun
My six year old loved it
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience
The food however, is what one might expect
It is very overpriced and not very tasty
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once
We had a good time
This place is so much fun
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build
I think the stuff was better than Disney
Our food was great too! And really large portions
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York
We will go back every time we are in the City
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO! I LOVED THE SHOWS
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YOU MUST GO
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde! I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors
Our server was very helpful and friendly
I am bringing my whole family back next time
The food was good too
What a great time for the family
All the entertainment and actors walking up to the tables deressed as Zany characters really makes this place special
My kids explored all the floors in this four floor mansion on sixth avenue
The food was suprisingly very good and the chocolate fudge cake for desset was superb! The prices are on the expensive side, but we expected the prices to be a little higher in midtown manhattan
It was worth the time and money
The server was very hospitable and actually took my kids around and explained all the different puppets
If you are looking for fun while you eat I reccomend you must see this place
This restaurant wasn't what I expected at all
First you have to pay an entertainment fee to go inside
The entertainment fee was clearly not worth it
They had cheesy special effects with animatronics that looked like they were going to fall apart
The lighting is very dark and makes you sleepy
Who wants strobe lights flashing while they're eating?!? Be prepared to pay $3 for a glass of soda that doesn't come with any refills unless you purchase the souvenier glass
The food was horrible
Our appetizers were room temperature and the chicken in the salad was way over cooked
As with any themed restaurant in NYC you're basically paying for the name and entertainment
I visited jekyll and Hyde Club for the second time over the past 5 years
Well I had more fun than the first time
The service was friendly and really took the time to make my family feel special
The restaurant was very busy but the server sat down with us talked, gave us directions to central park and Radio city
They added several new puppets and characters from the last time I visited
Order the nachos appetizer it was enough for 4 people and the Ribeye steak was delicious
Try chocolate fude cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert
This was my wife's 40th birthday
I used to go here 7 years ago when my travels brought me to NY
Great place when you are young
Ordered the T-Bone the way I liked it, medium rare
It came to me well done
I asked to have a new one, and the adventure began
I got bad service, and the night went down hill from there when the waiter told me the chef said it was not possible to cook this steak as I requested, because of the two different cuts
I should have him over for dinner
He would leave happy
We visited the restaurant yesterday and had a terrific time
It was fun and very entertaining
Something different which is great
The food was good with very large portions
The service was good as well
We definitely recommend this place
We will go back again!
Amazing how many people wrote favorable reviews about the food
it is cafeteria quality at best! And certainly not cheap either
The atmosphere is certainly fun with entertainment and all kinds of haunted house like decorations, but it still doesn't quite justify paying $20 for a t

WOW!!
Went there for the first time yesterday
EVERYTHING was just delicious
Had a grouper special in a tomato broth with saffron mashed potatoes, it was awesome
My friends had the pork chop and jumbo shrimp entrees and they were fabulous too
Our wait person was helpful and friendly
A most pleasant dining experience, except for the screaming 2 year old a few tables away
Great atmosphere and delicious food
We are a huge fan of their brunch - specifically the blt with a fried egg and avocado and their asparagus omelette with truffle oil
They often have a live guitar duo ala Django Reinhardt on Sundays
Dinner is delicious, too
Great pasta
Overall, just a nice, relaxed place with affordable, tasty food
I want so much to like this place
The food is delicious, the staff is getting better
The last 2 times I went there the wait person told me they were under new management
I hope that works
One time the waitress left in the middle of our dinner
No one gave us the check
We just left the money on the table
One Saturday brunch
I ordered bacon and eggs
I had to put more money in the meter and the food had not arrived
Over one hour I waited
I had to pay for 2 bloody mary's
Toni and I go there when we don't feel like walking
The beet salad is great

Went here with people from out of town, there was a great variety of food, great service, and a pretty setting
will definitely go back
Consistantly great food and service; if you want to invite somebody to dinner and not worry that the experience might be ruined by food or service, this is a good, safe place to pick
Service is always great! Attentive, knows the menu, etc
Last Thursday I was invited to the patio opening at McCormick and Schmick
I had  a wonderful time eating some of the best and freshest seafood and coldest draft  beer in NYC
I love the great happy hour they do there
Bring your appietite and don't worry about when the check comes, because the oysters, brie, mussels and beer are half price
WOO HOO!!!
We went there looking for what the restuarant used to be but found that it had changed to this about 2 years ago and thought lets give it a try and we was not disappointed
Food was fantastic (providing you like fish!!) service first class and the restuarant had a great ambience
Great value for money too at $125 for the two of us!!! I will definitely go again when im next in New York
Couldnt recommend it enough!
The menu has something that everyone will like on it -- including great seafood choices
Overall the food was great, and the experience was enjoyable
We plan on going back
My family and I ate dinner at McCormick Schmicks during our visit to NYC over Thanksgiving
Food was good and our server was right on top of our needs
Daughter's steak was not done enough and server noticed right away; got it recooked
Prices were about what expected for a midtown restaurant
Overall, an enjoyable time with good atmosphere/decor
This place is really overpriced
$6
50 for tea
but I guess this is the norm
I'm new to NYC! But
I would love the owner to consider hosting a 'tango bar' once - twice a week
this is the typical kind of place where tango could thrive
bring the dancers
offer free lessons at first
then play the music
and ppl will come
NYC is lacking in tango bars
I loved the atmosphere and friendly service
closed a little early [2 am]
but I'll be back for a cigar and a book
and
hopefully tango sessions soon
consider it!!
It's a bar, a tea parlor, a brunch spot and late night gnosh nook
It is quiet, spacious and clean with a charming and friendly waitstaff
My first visit here we had a sweet Euro waiter with a cute little accent
I was introduced to High Chai by a friend of mine with very discriminating tastes all things luxurious, so I came with high expectations
Those expectations were met and exceeded
He ordered a chocolate tea cake that was simply transcendental I ordered a tea infused vodka beverage that was exsquisite
This is the only place in the city that I know of where you can order dim sum, gravlax and latkes, passion fruit creme brule and a Chinese Cha Tao Ceremony under one roof
You may choose to induge in an English High Tea complete with chocolate dipped cookies and strawberrys on a romantic date or just go out with friends for an afterhours drink at 2:00am
Nothing about the High Chai experience is ordinary or quotidian
The music, design even the wash room art contribute to the ambiance of an establishment designed to transport customers back to a genteel refined moment in time
In these smoke-free, polystyrene cup, over-regulated and under-atmospheric times, High Chai somehow still manages to exude a smokey, exotic, old-world charm
Maybe its the fantastical looking bar with its huge crystal vats of infused vodka, maybe its the 1920s French love songs they play, or maybe its the friendly staff and musicians and writers who frequent the place, but whatever it is, the food alone was enough to bring me back
While they adhere to a certain traditionality in serving their teas; eg: samovar for the russian, chinese tea sets for the green, the food labours under no such restrictions and there is nothing ordinary on the menu
With a strong emphasis on combining different textures and flavours in each mouthful, dishes such as the masala chai brownie or the spiced tea rubbed steak are taken to another level
I recommend washing them down with a chilli margharita
I found High Chai on a fluke and it was a most pleasant surprise
The lemon-drop and lychee martinis were divine
The food was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully
The prices are reasonable
I will definately go back!
I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across this gem of a restaurant on Avenue B
The chic atmosphere offers a seductive mix of European elegance with Asian undertones
I brought several guests, from out of town, to the restaurant and they were truly amazed at the quality and selection of fine teas that were offered
Each of us had our own pot of tea and they were all heavenly
High Chai brings a new level of sophistication to the neighborhood and I for one think it is long overdo
Last night was the first time I tried High Chai
Friends recommended the place
I agree that the food is quite good and the ambience is nice
Service was terrible
Everything was late coming out, food arrived separately for all guests, one of whom received his food almost 2 hours after he ordered! Drinks were consistently late, and complimentary drinks were promised and never brought
To finish it all off, having brought out a bottle of complimentary wine, the waiter asked us if we were finished with it, when it was half-way done! I highly doubt that I will ever return here
I went to eat at this newly opened restaurant on the Lower East Side last friday the 23rd
It's been opened for only 4 weeks

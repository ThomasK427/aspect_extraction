we asked for a recomendation of a pasta that doesn't have tomato sauce, they bring out something that ends up being basically penne w/ manarana
And I gotta say, even after they 'comped' us the chucky-cheese style spaggetti w/ olive oil replacement dish, the bill still seemed a little over priced
There are better restarants out there, enjoy them instead
I went with a couple of colleagues from work for lunch
Immediately and without provocation, the waitress develops an attitude
As we looked through our menus after only a minute or so at a time when the restaurant was not particularly crowded, the princess waitress says with a sarcastic tone So, are you just going to have water? We were shocked
Since this seemed to come out of nowhere, it is clear she is unhappy with her job and has other things on her mind
Other things were said, but I will not list them here
So, if Bread wants to hire staff with that type of attitude, I will spend my money elsewhere
Good luck, Bread
I love this place, the food is just great and the place is so relaxing but fun
Recently my girlfriend and I (regrettably) decided to grab a bite and a drink at this supposedly hip place
In plain and simple English: the service at Bread Tribeca is disgraceful/miserable/pitiable, the food is just average
Ex
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables
we were just wondering
what if 6 out of 10 tables are going to order a bottle?
our glasses had been empty for a long while yet nobody was coming over to refill them (let's not even mention the never-refilled glasses of water)
The place was empty
When politely questioning the service, both of the waitresses showed the savoir faire and attitude proper of an irate truck driver (no offense to them, please)
Sad
this place is very cool, very hip, quite a good bar w/ a great bartender and it's pretty hard to beat the setting when they have all the doors open to the street
the only place in my view that they came up short was with the food, as it was just average
Now I'm only speaking of the pasta, people in my group had the pork chops and quite liked it, but the pasta was just bland food, nothing interesting or creative or different just sadly regular
It was disappointing given all the other elements of this restaurant that I like
Oh the brushetta (sp?) was BIZARRE (all pesto one cherry tomato???)!
My wife she is Italian wanted to try the restaurant for hearing about the pesto that had a write up in the times a year ago
What the times said about the pesto was right on the money
I had the calimari and the ribeye which was told by the most helpful attentive waiter a tall african american gentlemen that he was right, this is excellent
My wife had the trofie with pesto that reminded her of the pesto her grandmother had made
The drinks, were very good so good that I tried at least five of them extremely to my liking
And the desserts, I highly recommend the banana tart which came with the best vanilla gelato that I have ever tasted
I left with a smile on my face for the very good dining experience that I have had in awhile
Bread tribeca it is so choice
i don't know
i think it does not worth neither the waiting or the food expectation you might have
tasteless and overated i think- too much for nothing special
I think the pasta dishes are a little overpriced
The food is decent
Restaurant is chic
The music a little too loud for a regular restaurant
All in all, it would be more attractive if it doesn't charge $18 for a pasta dish with no worthy ingredients
I like this place and had a fantastic experience
The atmosphere was great, the drinks were delish, and the food was hearty and very yummy
The only downside was our waitress -- she forgot to order one of our side dishes, was not attentive, and then gave us our check before we finished our bottle of wine
This might have turned me off, but without us saying anything, the maitre'd (who was this AWESOME amazing person) gave us complimentary desserts
I think becuase he saw the mishap
Anyway, because of the great atmosphere and the maitre'd's more than generous and accomodating personality/service, I will come here again and again
It rocks!
The drinks were good if you like them fruity and the bread basket was very good w/ a nice selection
Our main dishes were horrible
My friends had to send the ribs back three times b/c it was too raw, blood raw
The waitress insisted it was well/medium
Why a waitress would agrue is beyond me especially when there's blood all over the plate
The pasta was boring
I was very unhappy w/ my experience at Bread
I might go back, but only for drinks at the bar
The space is very average not so sexy not so trendy just inbetween
Onto the food
I was with 11 other people and I tried most of the dishes, everything was either average or below average
The rib-eye was an exception and the ONLY dish that was satisfactory
The pasta was dissappointing!there was even one pasta dish that was like ramen noodles with green and red peppers! So my advice is
PASSY PASS spend your $ elsewhere
I live in the neighborhood and should have heeded the advice of several of my friends and not gone to this restaurant
The service was poor, the food marginal, and the ambiance so-so
There are so many better places than here, save your money for some place better
We were expecting greater things from this very cool looking restaurant
(It has cool lighting interior design inside)
The service was impeccable, though cool
When we shared our thoughts with the matre d' about our main entrees (and it wasn't a positive review), he merely shrugged and walked away
So much for their interest in our thoughts
The food was VERY bland and boring
Definitely not worth the price they ask
There are MUCH better Italian entrees out there in the world of food! QUITE a disappointment
On the up side, dessert was beautifully presented
So - see this as a place for a drink dessert to soak in the atmosphere, but DEFINITELY not for dinner!
Lots of places in New York can deliver great food, but the staff at this place is exceptional for a restaurant in this price range
They were very attentive to presentation and the needs of our table, especially the guy in the long-sleeve black shirt (who was a hottie to boot)
Will come again
I work around the corner from this place
Very nicely designed, good atmosphere, good waitstaff, not expensive, delicious food! Need I say more?! Well, I do think that one of their waiters should change their hairdo, it looks like some cow licked his hair
:-o
What a great place! I would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu, but I can comfortably say their mixed veggie panini was yummy, the pansotti (ravioli-esque pasta in some sort of cream-walnut sauce) even better, and their lychee basil twist cocktail--amazing
It sounds weird, but trust me, this drink should be served in bars all over the country
The vibe was cool--comfy but still chic, laid-back, minimalist; I'm sure it would be just as great for an easy dinner with girlfriends as for an intimate date
One thing: I DO wish they had a few more options as far as the dinner paninis go
I mean, the original Bread was/is known for these great sandwiches
It seems to make sense to have more of them available at this bigger outpost
I have to say that the food at Bread TriBeCa was a major letdown
Its sibling in NoLita has good food at a reasonable price
The food at Bread TriBeCa was bland
lacking
The pesto dollop ontop of my penne with red sauce was bad as it was uninviting
The calamari was bland and rubbery
The menu seems muddled
wants to be a TriBeCa restaurant, but can't shake its humble, simple roots
What a great new place! Loved it! The food was really good
I had the grilled shrimp served on a huge cutting board
The atmosphere was trendy yet not with the rude door attendants or velvet rope attitude
The staff was attentive and always noticed when we needed or wanted something

and salads( try mixed green with mozzarella or chicken)
They have free internet , huge flatscreen TV, and out-door sitting
P
S: Have to say couple of words about the previous review
Didn't they notice that the bathroom is under construction at the moment? Sunburst is a little gem of the area, nice and cosy, great and friendly staff!!!!
A terrific place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner
The crepes with fresh fruit are incredible
The split pea soup is great and the paninis are fresh and tasty
I visit Sunburst on my way to work almost every other day for breakfast and usually order out lunch for the office
The delivery is on-time and the service is first-class
Speaking as an over-weight man who loves to eat, this place is great!
Not sure what the other people are talking about, but breakfast and overall food is terrific
I go there to eat almost daily, and can't get enough of all the delights
Fantastic choiced in coffe for less than the average starbucks prices
Can't beat that! Home made deserts are a treat as well
Today I ordered a smoothie, as a co-worker recommended
Instead of getting what I ordered, I received something else - which contained an order I'm allergic to
Instead of owning up to their mistake they refused to re-deliver the correct smoothie, insulted me and told me it was my job to ask the server to re-read the order back
No apology -nothing
Any other company would have offered to bring the correct order and fix the problem
I will NEVER eat at sunburst again, and no one else should either
September 24, 2005
The coffee fruit tart were good; the actual breakfast food, terrible
My frittata was dry and tasteless
I think the fact that it was prepared in less than 10 minutes should have been a clue - other places slow-bake them
My dining parter's eggs Benedict was horrible
The eggs weren't poached - they were baked in a mold as evidenced by the neat rectangular shape they came served as, and the consistency was hard-boiled, not fluid yolk like poached should be
Also, the Hollandaise sauce was greasy and lumpy, and there was about a mere teaspoon on each egg
It tasted a bit odd and within an hour of eating, her stomach turned ill
The serving staff was completely confused
There is a wide range of food here
The breakfast/brunch menu is excellent
The prices are amazing- inexpensive and you get a lot for what you pay for
Coffee is also very good
We were ready for the New York scene
Great deli's, ma and pap restaurants, etc
, but was given the first hand experience of all of this at Sunburst Espresso Bar
When we walked in there was a huge menu that had everything from French Toast to Salads and Sandwiches to Pasta
The food was excellent
We would be regulars if we lived in New York
I am a picky eater and everything was great
Ambience was great
The male server could have been a little more personable
Soda is not fountain, it comes in a little bottle, so order a water just in case you are thirsty
Mostly a local hangout
When we were there it seemed like there were very few tourists
Credit Cards are accepted
Very good cafe food
Range of scrumptious deserts
Great place to meet a friend and hang
A great neighborhood joint
Menu boats wide selection
Breakfast, lunch and dinner
Definitely recommended
Nothing quite like it in immediate area
Best Coffee in NYC
Fantastic menu
Great choices of breakfasts, lunches, dinners
Great food for the buck
Excellent coffee, great prices, good food
All around, a great choice for a light meal
The Scene Choose from 40 feet of sweets at the takeout counter, or get a table inside one of two dining rooms
Marble floors and stamped metal ceilings do nothing to soften the caffeine- and sugar-charged chatter, but Veniero's is a popular stop for the dating crowd
Look your best--the lighting is quite harsh and there are lots of mirrors
The Food Italian pastry of the sponge-cake variety, soaked in rum or liqueur and filled with custard, whipped cream or sweet ricotta cheese
Tiramisu, the ubiquitous lady finger and mascarpone dessert, is still better here than most anywhere else
Wash it down with the very good espresso; do likewise with the cannolis
The baba rum comes in three flavors--sweet, sweeter and sweetest--and there are a half dozen styles of cheesecake
The pastries here are fantastic -- and cheap -- but there are so many of them and I really wasn't sure what everything was
Some of the rum-soaked stuff tastes really strange to an American palate
Nevertheless, the custard tarts were amazing
i will come back here time and time again - with every trip to NYC i will stop in and get a cannoli and a pound of italian cookies - reminds me of grandma!
Quickly - this is a very average restaurant, nothing to write home about except for the cheesecake that, to this out-of-towner - seemed the ultimate
BUT
I am heading to the Big Apple in mid April 06 with my family and intend to a very scientific blind taste test on Venerio's versus Johnny's, D'auito's, Ferrara bakery and Eileen's
I will consider other candidates fellow Citysearchers nominate ;-) Watch for results!
My wife and I bought our wedding cake at Venieros andn everyone thought is was amazing
I am not a cake fan and i even liiked it - i will tell also tell you that the service, price and friendliness of the staff was great! I would highly recommend this fine bakery to anyone in search of a delicious cake and they have FREE delivery too!
I love the Cheesecake and Cannoli's
I can't get enough
I wish I had one right now
NEW YORK! NEW YORK! This was the best bakery I have ever been to and thats no lie
Every time I visit New York it's a must!
I love this place
Simply the BEST CHEESECAKE in NYC
No one else even comes close
I've been here 3 times now, each time because someone in my group wanted to try out the hype
and each time, I was left thinking what's the big deal? The desserts I tried were bland and a little too sugary
The service was slow, due to the crowdedness, and the tables were cramped
I've been living in NY for more than 5 years now - and I can say that this is the most over-rated bakery in the city!
This place is by far one of the best bakeries I have ever been to
I am also seriously considering having my wedding cake from here
This is also one of the few places that is opened for dessert later compared to other places
I highly suggest this place for anyone, especially tourists
I've taken close friends here for post-birthday dinners for dessert and it has never failed to please
The coffee drinks are strong, so beware if you order any with liquor! Every dessert I've have ever ordered or had to-go has always been simply mouthwatering
every piece of every dessert just melts in your mouth
The great thing about this place is that the cakes have cream that is so light
it must be the secret recipe they use to make the whipped type of cream used in the cakes
If you can squeeze this into your trip in NYC, I highly suggest you try!!!

In Short A rotating display of funky local artwork decks the walls at this cozy Carroll Gardens coffee shop
Students, artists, and young parents with their tots in tow linger all day on the mismatched couches and chairs--the place closes way too early to lure a late-night crowd
Behind a small counter that's piled with baked goods, laid-back servers leisurely prepare coffee, tea, and light fare, like breakfast burritos, bagels, oatmeal, chicken chili, and open-faced brie and apple sandwiches
This is a neighborhood joint in the best sense of that word
Breakfast food and a few sandwiches
Coffee, Tea, Iced but not two hundred ways to drink a cup
I don't drink coffee so I can't judge that but if you want a friendly place to take a time out- read - people watch and enjoy a bagle, pastry or sandwitch this is a great place with liberal politics and nop pretensions
This is an amiable little place -- service is very lowkey, and the chairs and sofas scattered around seat locals who look like they've just come out to enjoy someone else's coffee instead of making their own
Which is a nice switch from the hordes of Manhattanites out to explore the new destination row
The atmosphere's a bit grungy, yes, but the music and the coffee are good
You will not find a burrito bigger or more tasty than Buddy's
A plus - they are fast! When I have them deliver, my food comes in less than 15 minutes
Always
They have everything from burgers to burritos and offer lots of salsa toppings for free
It's right across the street from a movie theater so it's a great pitstop before or after going to a movie
The yummy fried fish tacos provide enough of a reason to come back
I wouldn't bother with the burritos though
It's not fancy, but just try a fresh quesadilla with tender, smoky carne asada, hot off the grill and scattered atop the melted cheese and homemade guacamole
Perfect, perfect food
A complete meal, and only $6
95! Soooooo gooooood
I hope Buddy's is open forever
In Short This family-owned neighborhood spot was one of the first eateries to open on Smith Street's restaurant row
Regulars saddle up to the bar or settle into pink-clothed tables in the brick-exposed dining area, where a boisterous maitre d' recommends the house specialties--rice balls, crab cakes, and chicken stuffed with fresh mozzarella, eggplant, and prosciutto
The homey red-sauce Italian menu also includes baked clams, fried calamari, veal scaloppini, shrimp scampi, and pastas galore
We have been eating there for at least 20 years, and it is still one of the best Italian restaurants in Brooklyn, in our opinion
The Romano family is very hands on with the father supervising the kitchen and Santo, the son, running the room with a high degree of personal attention
The dishes are all cooked to order and made from fresh food; and, in additon to the outstanding Italian offerings, there are always delicious fish and meat specials
Also, there is an excellent selection of inexpensive wines from many regions
Treat yourself and become a regular there
I know Brooklyn food from Italy
Go to the Red Rose! In the mid '80's - when I was young - we'd travel all the way from Bensonhurst - which was full of Italian Restaurants- and go to the Red Rose with my very Italian family
I remember I had a crush on the waitress (An Irish girl related to the owner thru marriage) As I got older, I continued to eat there with friends family
In 2000, 2001 the food had become just OK
I didn't go back until the Winter of '02/03 O

- The food was great!! Now I go at least once a month!! Great Food - Great Wine - Great Place!
Great neighborhood restaurant! Very good menu very creative specials! A real TREAT!
I have been going here for years but on my last two visits I couldn't believe the difference
The food was awful and the prices went up
I guess they are trying to catch up to the prices for the rest of the street (Smith St
)
What a disappointment!
I have been to Red Rose several times over the past year and the food has been incredibly fresh and delicious every time
The service is great, very helpful
A better wine selection couldn't hurt, but this isn't that kind of place
First, I live by this place and it's easy to get a seat
Second, they have Sapporo (i can't imagine why some japanese restaurants don't)
Third, the cocktails are fantastic
Fourth, service is friendly
Fifth, it's not expensive
Sixth, the sushi! I love the sushi and while I admit you can get bettter, the menu is inventive and the food always fresh
I go at least once per week
See you there!
Osaka is hands-down the best sushi in Brooklyn- or Manhattan
Excellent, fresh, creative rolls (try the viagra roll)
Lovely outdoor seating, friendly staff, interesting Japanese entrees
Go early on weekends, as there can be a tiny bit of a wait
I found the service to be very good
We ordered a great deal of food for a party of four people, and had to pack a substantial amount of it to take home
The hostess came over and asked if everything was ok
The busboy kept our glasses full; the waiter warmed up to our table at the end of the night by cracking jokes
We enjoyed the ambience (garden was great)
The food was average at best
The miso broth was flavorful but I didn't like that they used baby bella mushrooms instead of asian mushrooms
The salad dressing was pretty bland (I don't think there was ginger in it)
The sushi pieces were large but didn't have too much flavor to them
The Elvis roll and Mike roll were good for the cost
I love this place
I live in the city and travel all the way to Brooklyn on a regular basis just to eat here
The food is just
amazing
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
I've been eating sushi now for approximatly 20 years, and have eaten in many places
I've now had the pleasure of dining in this fine establishment a few times and everytime the food is better and better
From sushi to sashimi to even the Japanese kitchen this restaurant not only touches on every cornerstone of a Japanese restaurant but they do each so well, that I have found it hard to eat sushi anywhere else
The garden is beautiful and romantic place to share dinner with that special someone or just with friends
The sushi itself comes in eight large pieces and is inexpensive but most importantly is good
If you don't take my word for it, just try it I promise you won't be dissapointed
I hope this review was helpful in making the choice of where to eat in a often restaurant overcrowded city
We went to NYC last March to visit my brother at school and he said that this was the best sushi in town
When we got there were were seated promptly and were served rather quickly
The only problem my party found was that when people asked for knives and forks (there were only chopsticks on the table) the waitress laughed at them
Overall a great place to eat
I have been to many sushi restaurants in NYC, i think Osaka is one of the best in food and value
I went with 3 other friends on a Friday night, it was packed with people
We only waited for few minutes for our table because we have made a reservation
We ordered beef tataki and was delicious! We also ordered sashimi and they are fresh and big in portion
You must try the blue fin toro, the best i ever had! I give them an overall 9
5!
I have been for sushi in 100s or places around the US and internationally
I realize that there may be more high end places out there
But they know there fish here
Nobu is fantastic and innovative, but these guys are an everyday kind of thing
Yes, the slices are huge, but they're also the best quality in town
Their kobe is unbelievable, their monk fish liver was an eye opener
The one thing I recommend is to get either the Sushi or Sashimi Chef Special and tell them to make it exotic
I love the back in the summer
Although they did mess it up with that rust this year

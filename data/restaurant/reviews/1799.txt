Fuelray for dessert and drinks
Good combo for a good night
If you ever ordered or even picked up food from this Restaurant on a Monday-Wednesday night\Saturday mornings Tameka is the person to talk too service is fast, but good
I also love their Carribean Rum Cake it' wonderful
The Scene The two-tiered restaurant's Fiestaware-inspired plates are lime, sea blue, yellow and rose; the upholstered seating boasts a rousing cowboy print in red; the ceiling fans spin inside blown-up, flea market cages
This is no ordinary upscale dining room; it's a celeb chef's winking paean to the Southwest--complete with killer cactus-pear margaritas
The Food Flay's dishes are fresh and vibrant, flavored with tangy fruits, chiles and herbs
Sweet corn explodes in the garlic-corn and shrimp tamale, as well as in the preview basket of warm muffins
Messy mango-basted short ribs make a delicious appetizer, and while the tuna steak is solid but not dazzling, the blue corn-coated snapper sings
Pucker-intensive passion fruit ice cream and a white chocolate ice cream sandwich topped with warm cherry sauce end the meal on a high
Interesting range of southwestern inspired dishes - a few too many for my tastes having too sweet a flavor, but ok apart from that
Deep fried zucchini flowers were fun (but small quantity), rabbit was nice with cumin flavor, good basic vegetable selection
If you are going there I would try the more imaginative dishes
Service was ok but took some getting attention
Reasonable choice of pricey wines
Would think it is the place to go back to when you want a change from your regular type of fare
Not a destonation restaurant though
Sat upstairs which seemed to be a good compromise if you wanted to talk
I went during restaurant week which was probably a mistake-- the food seemed to have been assembled on a factory line without much presentation or pizzazz
Cold shrimp taquitos and a chile relleno filled with pink mush (okay it was goat cheese and beets) were definitely sub-par
The service was lousy
It was obvious that we were NOT from NYC and they promptly assigned us the worst waiter to ever grace a pad and pencil
The food was good and the decor was fine
But honestly, I can find that in most any restaurant I walk into in my hometown
What I am not used to and is hard to find here in Chicago is bad service
The margharitas were not exceptional, just okay
I would not return
They said that is the best place for margaritas , well I had better
Even though I can say that are strong
The hostess had a bit of an attitude when we told her we were early for our reservation even tough the restaurant was half empty
Our server was very nice
The food was just okay
I had the red snapper
I really think their food is overpriced
The ambience and decor was great
Party of 4 on a Monday night
Nearly full but not crowded
The lamb chops were cooked just right, great taste and a good size portion, with the corn tamale a real pleaser
Good tequilla makes good margaritas-- they use good tequilla
The chopped salad was not only generous but had a wonderfully light and tangy dressing
OK, its costs around $65
00 per person with tip but you get a wonderful meal, good service, plenty of food and can say that you ate at Bobby Flay's flag ship restaurant
We will return!
Too much hype
Food can be a lot better for the price you're paying
Went with a group of 25+
not one left the restaurant happy
We were seated upstairs and there were barely any room for us to breathe
Food was overly and unneccesarily spiced, desserts were horrible
overall, just save your money
I went to Mesa Grill with a large group of colleagues
The food was outstanding, as was the service
Funny - we were also seated by the door, which was freezing! That aside, the pulled pork risotto cake appetizer was some of the best southwestern I've had in awhile (and I'm from Texas originally)
After such a great intro, the entrees were disappointing
The salmon was completely tasteless except for a suspicious fishy flavor
The chicken was very tender, with some great spices
but is it really worth $27?! I'd have to say the best part of the meal, aside from the app, was the catus pear margarita
However, the house glass of zinfandel is underwhelming, especially at $13 per glass
Also, the server said all of three words to us the whole night
Great place to try during restaurant week, but we would not recommend this restaurant to friends
i went during rest week and had an amazing dinner
i was too seated in the front, it was chilly and i politely told the waitress and she sent the maitre'd over who said he would warm it up
the service was amazing, we had a great report with our waitress
the food was amazing!!! every plate was beautiful and full of many tastes
an amazing value at restaurant week
We look forward to Restaurant Week to try new things and to give gourmet places a try before investing over $100
We were excited to try Mesa and read great things
We were greeted by a hostess who started,Well, you didn't call to confirm but we have a table anyway
We made our reservation online, nothing about calling was mentioned
They gave us the worst table, just beyond the cold front door, next to the entrance to the stairs with the jam packed bar on the other side (grand central)
We were freezing
Our waiter said 3 words to us, wisked away our food as we were finishing, and the maitre'd could not take his eyes off our table waiting for us to leave
I would recommend the food, but even when paying Restaurant week prices you are paying for service and we got the bargain basement bare minimum
i love this place
the food came out in a timely manner, it was not rushed at all and the server was very helpfull
i love bonny doon wines and they serve a white one by the glass and a red they serve in half bottle which is such a nice treat! as for food, the pork was out of this world!! i will soon be back at this grill
Dinner at Mesa Grill was so great
The waiter was very helpful and attentive, but not over board
The margaritas were great, the appetizer, main course and dessert were all delicious and artfully arranged on the plate
We even saw Maya Angelou while dining at Mesa Grill that night
It was great food, great service and good value
Having enjoyed a fine meal here years ago, my wife and I decided to drop in with the kids on a whim
Her lamb porterhouse was very good, but my spiced pork loin signature dish was simply stunning
It's nice to know that some restaurants can still pleasantly surprise you even after many years
Their homemeade blackberry icecream is also a winner
Bravo Bobby!
I have been here three times now and love it! Those that have joined me here have enjoyed it too! I have also heard from friends of friends that have worked at Mesa, that Flay is actually not a bad person to work for
I guess that is just the way he comes off in public
Back to the food
it is great! I have gotten something different each time and been satisfied
My favs are the Steak and the Rabbitt
Always get the blue corn pancake with BBQ duck appetizer
The spice is more for flavor than for heat
They do a great job of balancing that
Tends to be a bit more expensive than it should, but it's still good
*** Recently had brunch here
Very, very good and less expensive than dinner
The meal I had last week was good
However, the restaurant was running out of items, there was only one daily feature, which they had run out of, and a few other items were out of stock as well
Sorry to be a nitpicker, but that is a restaurant problem, the ordering, while wanting to err on the side of not wasting food, should be done properly

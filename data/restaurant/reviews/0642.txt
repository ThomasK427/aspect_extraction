Our taste buds were simply amazed by the food; fois gras appetizer followed by tuna with horseradish sauce and whipped potatoes
My boyfriend went for the rabbit loin, which was also fantastic
The dessert list, although a bit limited, still offers inventive combinations
The staff was super friendly and I highly recommend this place
You will walk out thinking about the next time you are going back
6 of us wanted a new, good, reasonable restaurant to try
We found it at Kloe
very fun drinks - the Kiwi is awesome - good food, great atmosphere and fun waitstaff
I had the scallops which were pretty good, but others at the table made better choices - the duck and the sea bass were great
We keep recommending Kloe to friends, which will bite us when we want to go back and can't get a reservation
Visited Kloe last night for dinner and was amazed that this little gem is located in my neighborhood
The cuisine of Erica Miller is truly unbelievable
I had the Mahi Mahi with orange foam and the mushroom consume
The organic tomato tart as an appetizer was absolutely delicious
The service could not have been more attentive and the preservation of the inside speakeasy makes it a special find
The bartender Marty is quite a welcome character
The food was below average and the service was not memorable
The atmosphere was the highlight
The hostess gave us a poor table and we asked to be reseated
She promptly explained that all tables were assigned and they needed to turn each table over twice that night
I insisted (since we were the first to be seated) and she unwillingly seated us at a better table, but certainly not the best in the house
She didn't give us the early tasting menu
This seems to be a good deal for $25
It includes appetizer, entree, and dessert
I only found out about it because another table was offered the menu
The menu attempts to pull off gourmet, but fails
You would think a new restaurant would err on the side of trying to hard instead of hardly trying
I left dissatisfied
The food took me by complete surprise: at first we couldn't choose from the great menu/wine list
Settled on the Spicy Tuna Tartar, better than most
Strong, robust flavors
Yum! My date had the special pasta w/ lobster basil
Portion was too large, but we ate it anyway
Did I say Yum? Well best was the Salmon w/ Spoonbread
Intense tasty flavors
Mexican Hot Chocolate was only very good
I celebrated my birthday with friends at Kloe the other week
I wanted to try something new, different and near the West Village
I was very pleasantly surprised - the food was absolutely delicious - everything that everyone at the table ordered, from the appetizer to the dessert
We were seated promptly (thanks to a reservation), the decor was cozy - kind of ski-lodgish, and the service was good, though when it got busy, it was a bit hard to catch the waitress's attention
All in all, highly recommended
(Tip - the entrance is to the left of the glass door - don't walk in to it
Also, the Gnocci with mushrooms is TO DIE FOR - so is the duck!)
Great vibe- a local hang w/ gourmet food---light, tasty, delicious
Visited last week for a late dinner, and every single item was carefully executed and delicious
The service could not have been more gracious
At the end of the meal, I had a chat with the chef and raved about her food
She offered to send me the recipe for her fabulous horseradish sauce by email, went through the whole prep for the pepper-crusted seared tuna, etc
This is a great restaurant for foodies!
Atmosphere and decor is comfortable and familiar, it feels like you are at your coolest friends house (not the look but the feel)
Great selection of liquor offering hard to find brands (i
e
- Hendrick's Gin)
Staff is courteous and accomodating but just a touch too relaxed
The food selections are varied and great for a group outing
Some of the individual flavors in the dishes we tried (sweetbreads, beet app
, rabbit, vegan vegetable medley) got overpowered or lost due to the introduction of other elements in the dish
The rabbit for example tasted more like wgat it was stuffed with than rabbit, and the vegan vegetable medley got overpowered by a prevading taste of garlic
Dessert was beautiful to look, tasted good but not to die for
The service was friendly but disorganized
It's a new restaurant, so give them a few more months to get it together
The appetizers were delicious
The duck breast was excellent, but the gnocchi was too buttery and way too salty (and I love both)
Overall, I'd go back for another try
There are some restaurants that just have a great vibe, and this is one
I went with 3 friends and had a wonderful evening
good service without attitude, beautiful but low-key ambience, great wine
the food was also quite good, though I have to say it was not as memorable as the overall experience
I loved it and will return
Utterly Delightful! Wonderfully inviting atmosphere, comforting though not somnolent
Absolutley inspired seared tuna a poive! Salads and appetizers were tasty, too!
This place has a wonderful mixture of great food and ambience
Kloe is a great space with absolutely amazing food
It's appropriate for a romantic dinner or a birthday group
The menu is varied enough that even my difficult friends found food they could eat
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great
The food was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the wine excellent
Save room for dessert
Dug the blue bar area too
Imagine finding this little inviting enclave on busy 14th street
The ambiance was great - quick seating and friendly hostess
The food was delicious - I had the tuna au poivre and a beet and goat cheese salad
The bill was not bad $200 for 4 people including appetizers and a nice bottle of wine
Chef Erica Miller brings class to an area that needed a great, friendly restaurant
Perfect place for a first or 21st date
There is also a great private downstairs dining area
Gave us such a run around to get our table even though we had a reservation
Food is pretty good, limited menu - expen$ive drinks
Hostess is way too young an inexperienced makes for a bad first impression
The wait staff was great though!
A warm inviting environment with the menu to match
It was a cold, rainy day when I walked in and the ambiance and service immediately melted my day away
then, the appetizers and wine did the rest of the work
Loved the diversity of the menu
Creative tastes in every entree
It was difficult to decide what to have
would highly recommend this restaurant as a great night out! My favorite of all: a welcoming host/hostess without tude! bravo for that!
The pork loin was a little on the overdone side
The NY strip steak was excellent

I have to admit that the 6 or so times I've been here, I've gotten the same thing to eat every time: Swordfish with crabmeat/sweetpotato hash
I love it! I've tasted off of friends plates and different desserts and have never put a bad thing in my mouth here
You do have to keep of top of the waiter for drinks, bread, etc
They are very slow or not attentive at all
Go at 5:00 on a weekday and enjoy
Went there with a friend for early dinner
The food was all right, nothing special
The waitress was so mean that she didn't guide us to a table when we were obviously waiting to be seated! She eventually gave us a table on the very corner, which was so uncomfortable! Couldn't believe it
What is it
She didn't like it my friend and I were looking damn sexy?! Never again!
Like all BR Guest Restaurants, BWG, sells class (the restaurant looks nice, the hostesses are pretty, etc
) but fails to deliver
We waited half an hour (we had a reservation) and when we asked to be seated, were given the worst table in the place
Once we eventaully got seated (all tables are practically on top of each other), we were hustled through our meal by a waitstaff that clearly knows how quickly they need to turn the table over
If you want a nice dining experience, there's a million restaurants to go to other than this high-class TGI Fridays
What a delightful spot to have dinner on a warm summer evening! There was a short wait for a table, which we spent at the bar, then we were seated on their patio
The food (blue marlin, carb-buster sushi, chocolate fondue) was wonderful, the wine list extensive, the sommelier helpful - all in all, a great place for a romantic dinner!
Everything about this place is at least good, but there isn't too much that qualifies as great
The appetizers are very good, the entrees are good, and the desserts are rather mundane
Overall, the food is good, though I recommend skipping dessert and just going for an appetizer and entree
The service is good, and the atmosphere provides a very comfortable place in which to eat
I would certainly go there again
Went with a group of 5 for Restaurant week
Wanted to check it out because we had heard so many good things, to see if it was worth coming back on a regular night
The food was average at best
I can't say I haven't had better
The restaurant itself was beautiful, and we understood that they were having a busy night, but a badly cracked water glass, no silverware and an inattentive waitress (had to ask for a knife, among other things, repeatedly) was unacceptable
The dinner arrived 2 minutes after the appetizer
We felt rushed and uncomfortable
Certainly not what we expected from the famed Blue Water Grill
We were given second rate treatment because we were ordering from the restaurant week menu
I believe that the place did not put its best foot forward
My friends and I wont be coming back
I brought my family here when they were visiting me in NY and I had heard great things about this restaurant
It was good, but not great
The Mahi was definitely better than the Swordfish which I felt was pretty dry
The drinks were ok but could of been stronger
We had 7 people and were squeezed into a table probably made for 6 so we didn't have a ton of room
The service was good though but I won't be back for a while
The food and service was excellent
The prices are very reasonable
The portions are not huge but filling, and leave enough room for desert
My only suggestion is to get there early on a Saturday night if you don't like big crowds
I had a 6:45 reservation and by the time I left at around 8:15, the bar area was mobbed and hard to pass through to the exit
With the most fabulous atmosphere and service in the city, the location, food, and charm all make this one of the most spectacular scenes in all of New York
One will walk away, feeling full and entirely satisfied by the extraordinary wine and food (not to mention the first-class service)
The Blue Water Grill is an absolute must for anyone living in or visiting the tri-state area
Don't forget to sample the lobster mash potatoes! It's a must! Yum!
Four of us went for a perfect evening out
The food was excellent, with lots of choices and nice sized portions
From the hostess to the waiters, everyone was friendly
We especially loved the tuna and the desserts
We made reservations however they aparently overbooked or something so we had to wait for about 40 minutes
and even though we were the ones who were put out, the hostess was rude to us about it
However, the wait was worth it, the food was just great - make sure you have the tuna
The upstairs room was pretty warm but not that crowded
It was an alright dining experience
my boyfriend took me there on friday night
it's very crowded, so you sould make a reservation in advance
very nice atmosphere
it gets kinda noisy, but all the tables are not too small or too big; just right size so you and your girl/boyfriend can seat closer and talk without yelling
food was great
i had a robster
they are famous for seafoods, but meat was great as well
my boyfriend had steak and he absolutely loved it
most of the wines (bottle) are on pricey side
The wait was very long, even if you have reservations
The food was absolutely wonderful
I cannot forget the salmon in wasabi sauce
Great ambiance with the live jazz music
Expensive
romantic
impressive
Great place to bring your date
Very nice place
Went there for drinks and dinner
The upstairs bar was kinda busy when I got there, but it dind't really matter
was able to fit in and have a couple
Diner downstairs is GREAT! They had a 3-piece jazz band playing that was really good
They played all cover songs, but switched them up really nice
Only drag was that there was a long time inbetween sets
The bar downstairs was a nice place to grab an after dinner drink and take in some more music
The food was delicious (crabcakes, spring rolls, blackened tuna, lobster/scallops and definitely the chocolate fondue all fab)
Our wait staff all pleasant, easily available and courteous as well
Definitely sit in the jazz area, music is low enough to talk over and enjoyable enough to have playing during your meal
Bring family/friends/dates to impress
Meal was worth the money especially for the city
DEFINITELY worth a try and a revisit!
The restaraunt was classy and romantic
The service was good
The food was fair
I've had better meals
The jazz bar is a good place for couples
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! We made reservations for 8:30 pm on a tuesday but we were not seated for almost an hour because they were running behind schedule because the management overbooks
Maybe the management should have more faith in their chef who makes an AMAZING chilean sea bass
but then again it is loud and many customers get drunk and obnoxious and waitresses are sub-par
hmm
great food, but not a great place to dine
Best seafood I've had in the city yet! Great atomosphere
Jazz room if you like

The service is slow and the waiters are not friendly
In addition, once they delivered the wrong meal to my home which I didn't send back
On a second occassion they delivery bad quality food and instead of replacing it, they offered a credit which they never honored
I will not order from them again because they have no regard for their customers
consistently good food
we order from them all the time and are never disappointed
the pad thai is great, and so are the chicken dishes
delivery takes a while
definitely a good, solid place for a casual night out or order-in
if you like your thai food fused with mediteranian, french, or even american, steer clear of this park slope hideout
thankfully, i like my thai fused with THAI
Rice Thai Kitchen delivers
from the pad thai, pad see yu, to the duck dishes and of course to the ubiquitious thai tea and coffee, Rice delivers good quality, affordable and pretty darn authentic Thai food in a city known for fusing it with every other imaginable combination
head out and see for yourself
recommended
because of the food
The decor was respectable
Their prices were commendable
Our first disappointment came when we were informed, at 8:30 pm, that it was too late to be served soup
Then we found out, at no fault of the restaurant's, that they only serve beer and wine
Out of fried ice cream
Credit card machine broken
SLOW service
Then, the trip to the bathroom made me feel like I was at a gas station
(A clean one, though)
But, the food was so amazing, nuanced flavors layering on top of one another
We will DEFINITELY be going back
Consistently one of the most delightful restaurants in the Slope
Great food, complex flavors, delightful atmosphere and really good prices
Waitstaff is always pleasant
Hey, if they're sometimes crowded, it's because the secret is out! Try them for lunch, if you can
now that's a tasty bargain
Can't beat the chicken with spices
Yum
Definitely the best Thai restaurant in Park Slope
Food is very good and quite affordable
Service is impeccable
I once went to the restaurant, only to discover it was closed, but the owners were eating with their family
They invited me to join them for lunch - no charge
Can't ask for more hospitality than that!
My friends and I LOVE this place!!! The food is consistently amazing, and ALWAYS served quickly
The service is very good in the restaurant, and for the most part good for delivery (although they do expect a generous tip)
And the food is so cheap for the taste!!! Whenever I can't decide what to eat
Rice Thai Kitchen it is!!!
Best delivery food I've eaten in the Slope
Chicken options are fantastic, notably chicken with spices
Pad Thai is great
Pleasant decor, great carvings, but WAY too crowded, and the food is not what it could be
There are a few toehr Thai places int he local 'hood, and I'll be going to those instead fo coming here again
I gave this place a few tries, but won't be heading back
this is the best restaurant ever
when you go order pad si ew and chicken masaman w/ sticky rice
it's a little expensive but trust me
the food is worth it!!!
My mother and I were two of five girls in the entire restaurant so that made me a bit uneasy, however, the friendly at home like atmosphere made me feel at home pretty quickly
The drinks (beer, wine, soda and water) are self-serve
help yourself
The food is ordered for the table in very large portions
If you order individually, the check will be triple what you expected so just order for the table!!! The waiter/owner will tell you what is on the menu for the day and you order any number of antipasta, pasta and meat dishes for the table and pay accordingly
I'm not quite sure how this place has still survived considering it's lacking decor and isolated location but it seems to be a favorite with da boys!
Two Tom's food is excellent, it more than makes up for the lack of decor
The one waiter will tell you what fresh item are available that day and you can't go wrong
Its great for groups!
The Scene This neighborhood Peruvian restaurant manages to feel upscale and homey at once
The inviting scent of rotisserie chicken is overwhelming--once you recover, you'll find a warmly decorated room with exposed brick and romantic, but not-too-dark, lighting
Service is inconsistent, but while you wait for your food, at least you can nosh on complimentary plantain chips, served with tangy dipping sauces
The Food The mid-priced traditional Peruvian menu includes one of the borough's best selections of super-fresh ceviche, as well as a long list of roasted and grilled meats
Crab meat marinated in tart yellow pepper sauce makes a fine start, particularly when followed by the juicy rotisserie chicken, a house specialty that goes beautifully with a baked sweet potato side
Be sure to save room for the sensational lime coconut flan
We were bored of the almost daily Thai and Chinese take-out, so we decided to order from Coco Roco
For the most part we were quite happy
The cold potato appetizer with a spcy cheese sauce was somewhat of a disappointment: the sauce was bland not spicy and the potatoes were large and mealy chunks, not quite cooked through
Everything else we tried was very good
I loved the roast port with flavorful rice and fresh tomato sauce
The chicken empanadas were flaky, hot and tasty
The beef stir-fry was a little tough, but tasty, and everyone knows that it's not a good idea to order beef for delivery (or sushi
) Generous portions reasonably priced also helped with out opinion of this place
I love the brunch at Coco Roco and each time I have been there the food has been AMAZING
There is a litte bit of a wait on the food, but it is well worth it!
I've only had take-out from here but a couple of their dishes, along with the spicy green and orange sauces, are amazing
Try the pulpo olivo and their yuca
Those along can make a great meal!
Seriously, the worst service I've ever had at a supposedly decent restaurant
Took 20 minutes and three requests to the waitress to get a drink, and then my steak came opposite to how I ordered it--twice! The third time, it still wasn't quite right, but I was starving at the point
Food was mediocre at best
And the waitress barely apologized
Would not patronize again
THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW
I WENT TO COCO ROCO, LAST NIGHT, IT WAS NOT BUSY AT ALL
I ORDERED CEVICHE, AND IT TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR TO GET MY FOOD
THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE, AND FINALLY WHEN THE CEVICHE ARRIVES, IT TASTE LIKE VINAGER
I TOLD MY WAITER, AND HE SAID THAT IT WAS FINE
SO I ASKED, TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, AND ONE OF THE OWNER WHO MANAGES THE PLACE CAME TO MY TABLE, TOLD ME THAT THE CEVICHE WAS FRESH
THEY DIDN'T OFFER ME TO CHANGE THE FOOD OR TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE
THEN HE SAID THAT IF I DONT WANT TO PAY FOR MY FOOD HE WOULD GAVE ME THE FOOD FOR FREE, HE TURNS ARROUND, AND INSULT ME IN SPANISH
I COULD NOT BELIVE IT
I went there twice this past week
I had the sesame salmon ceviche and the snapper, both of which were perfectly seasoned and sauced
We also had the rotisserie chicken, the smell envelops you when you walk in the door and it was just as good tasting as it was smelling
We also had the fried sweet plantains (snack!) and the salads had this mustardy-limey dressing zig-zagged all over the plate, plenty of freshness and bite

This restaurant is near my office, and I consider it to be a very good, inexpensive Thai restaurant
I like the vegetarian box, which includes a variety of carefully prepared items
The people from San Francisco who panned the place must have come on a bad day, which in my experience is not at all typical
Though sparse on vegetarian selections, this restaurant has great ambience and a great bar
Try the Bangkok fruit punch, or floating market drinks
The service is prompt and attentive, and lunch was pretty quick
In Short This late-night landmark--and one of the city's finest examples of deco-diner architecture--is a low-key, after-hours favorite with everyone from club-hoppers to drag queens to investment bankers
The kitchen cranks out a steady roster of embellished diner fare like omelets, club sandwiches, and burgers
Sun-drenched diners enjoy sidewalk tables, and at night, this just might be the only candlelit shiny diner in town
Quite frankly, the only people who think this place can be good are drunk partygoers
After trying this slop once for a Sunday morning brunch, and then vowing never to go back again, the only reason why the Empire can still be in business is because of its 24 hour dining
Only if you're absolutely starving
Service was good, however, in contrast with other reviewers
After waiting for 45 minutes (tables around us who ordered after us were served), I politely enquired how long our meal would be
The waiter replied 'When it's ready!'
When I picked my jaw up from the floor, I asked him to actually check
The waiter returned from the kitchen to say it was still going to be a few minutes
Some time later he came back to our table to say that one of our meals had run out! Clearly that hadn't started to cook our food and the order had been forgotten
We were repeatedly told how busy they were but that really isn't an excuse in NYC
Needless to say we left
In a city where restaurants open and close every week, Empire Diner can't seriously think they stand a chance with such petulant, incompetant and sarcastic staff! Don't waste your time
these people are imbeciles who don't even know the basics in hospitality (e
g
- graciousness? promptness?)
also, their food is overpriced and bland
i would say it was a totally underwhelming experience, except i left there feeling very angry and annoyed
i'm glad that i went there so that i can never return
here's a tip boys, just b/c you think that you lead the high-life after hours, doesn't make your waitstaff job any more glamorous, it's still food service
The Empire Diner, while it looks legitimate, complete with neon signs and the word diner in its name, is not a real NYC diner
The menu is a sparse one-pager (no pancakes, no tuna melts, etc
), and apparently substitutions of any kind are not allowed
I asked for sweet potato fries instead of the Empire's greasy, tasteless, crunchless chips, and I was informed that substitutions like that are not allowed
Also, oddly, they don't offer diet soda of any kind - apparently diet soda is not in high demand among New Yorkers, who are surely neither weight-conscious or observant of sugar intake!?! Here's a substitution I recommend - substitute the Empire Diner for a real NYC
There are plenty along 23rd street across the entire island
I used to go to Empire Diner all the time
Many of the dishes are great-tasting and good value
It's knock is really the service
I'm not someone who complains about service, but sometimes you can get a server whose attitude is just well out of bounds
Your chances for a difficult server can really go up on the weekends in nice weather when the outdoor cafe fills up
Plus, despite being a diner, Empire doesn't have pancakes
What kind of diner doesn't have pancakes?   I started going to The Half King, just around the corner, instead
A more interesting menu, consistently good service and no attitudes
They serve food until about 2 AM
Learned about it from The Diner's Deck - they take some of the most quintessential diner fare items and deliver them with flair
It was a late night and we really enjoyed the quite live Piano Music (I don't believe they were show tunes like a previous reviewer mentioned) and classic rail-car experience
The vanilla malt was the best I tasted in New York
The blackout cake was fantastic
My buddy said his omelette was really good
This place is truly wonderful
Best of all, our bill came to $16 after we dropped our Diner's Deck $10 OFF card
Empire Diner is cozy, sometimes even pretty and you get to hear cheesy showtunes performed live by hired musicians as well as by the restaurant's guests
But don't come for the food or the service
The burgers are decent enought, but the french fried potato slivers that come with them are artless greasy little crimes
Other items we tried were pretty awful too
The worse part is the most awful service imaginable
The waiters here just don't give a hoot about their customers
While we were trying to have dinner, all of the waiters spent their time playing with spilled milk at the counter, not paying any attention to the diners
We literally had to yell to get their attention
Really dreadful
Empire may not have the best food, or be the cheapest, or even have incredible service
But it's not a mediocre feeling place at all
You feel special eating in this rail car and slowly drinking coffee, looking out onto a rainy 10 Avenue
The food is actually pretty good and it's the only place I can find Abita Turbodog, a microbrew from Louisiana
So I'll keep coming back, and feeling special
I've been going to the Empire for years
I love the food and the ambience
The chicken soup is to die for
This place has a sense of humor and look sharp -- you can often spot celebs
This place is not even worth getting off the train for
The eggs are runny, the steak is almost possible to chew, etc
The only good thing about this place is the decor
It's hard to find a place with outdoor seating in NYC--and this one is a block away from my front door--but twice I have experienced bad service from the snotty glam guys who moonlight as waiters
If the food was good enough, I might bite my tongue and return, but its not
Don't bother
Had lunch at the 58th St location, thought the food was very good for the money
Not a destination restaurant, but if you're hungry for breakfast or lunch, big portions and good quality for the money
We only ate their once, but the service was very good on that occassion
The Scene The succession of dining, takeout, and kitchen areas appears never-ending as it meanders for half a city block, finally terminating in an unused corner ala the Flatiron building
A quiet Chinese-food delivery shop on most weeknights, Sammy's explodes with young and eclectic West Villagers at the peak weekend sittings -- and the staff turns the food out pronto
The Food The Chinese menu is large, but remember: It's called a noodle shop for a reason
Order the noodle and soup dishes, as well as their dumplings and fried rice cousins
Cantonese roasted meats are also surefire, as are several of the small appetizer plates like sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves with red bean paste
Don't miss the vibrant sesame spinach or the abundant sauted watercress with sliced garlic
The vegetable offerings are strong enough to make up for slightly less optimistic meat and seafood entrees
I placed an order in advance for delivery for a cake from their new bakery next door and it turned out to be a complete nightmare
The girl behind the counter BARELY speaks English and short version of the story the cake did not arrive at 1pm as promised
When I called to find out where the cake was at 1:45, no one had any kind of reason as to why it wasn't there in the first place, offered a fake apology as she brushed me off and no compensation for ruining the surprise party that was planned (it's hard to have a birthday surprise party without a cake!)
The sad part is that the cake was great but they are completely unreliable and were just downright rude at one point
My finance stood by and couldn't believe that they didn't even offer up any kind of compensation for all the trouble they caused
Aside from the bakery, I think their noodles are overdone and seriously overrated
There is more sophisticated Chinese food to be had in NYC, but Sammy's does a pretty good job for good value
The Chilled Cold Noodles are delicious, but VERY spicy, so beware
Wonton soups are ok, not great, but lots of the other noodle soups are very good
Roast pork is top notch, so is the chow fun
The place is a factory, but it's great to have in the neighborhood for takeout or quick stop-in gorging
I thought that I've been to most of the good Asian eats in the city when a friend of mine invited me for a West Village dinner
To my surprise, Sammy's is Chinatown eats without the crazy traffic and detritus of Canal Street
The best bets to order are the roasted pork, crispy chicken and duck
Water Cress with garlic is a real veggie delight
Plus the noodles and dishes are so huge that you have no choice but eat family style

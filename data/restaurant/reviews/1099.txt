The cooking process is a lot of fun! Perfect place for hanging with friends or a laid back date
Excellent service, environment, and more importantly, excellent food
I'm an experienced shabu shabu lover
To me, what distinguishes the good ones from the bad ones are the selection of raw material(meat, vege, etc
), the flavor of the soup base and the dipping sauce
Swish definitly belongs to the higher end of the scale in all three categories
Swish Moo is one of my favorite on their menu
I also love the house special and chicken flavored soup base
ShaCha dipping sauce would always be my #1 choice
Did I mention they also come in big portions? yup, they do, unlike the other japanese restaurants
Oh, one more thing, definitly definitly eat the soup after you finish swish swish
The soup in the end contains all the good flavors and nutrients
That just pushes the experience of eating shabu shabu to its highest climax:-)
It just completes the meal
Bon Apetite!
Happy to have found this place! It's in a good area - a pretty block right near NYU
The food is incredible
The staff are great and explain all of the customs, how it's done
They serve HUGE portions of fresh food that you cook in a pot of broth yourself - it's different, but interesting to learn this Asian custom
I had the coconut tea with tapioca pearls to drink - a new experience, very interesting, and very delicious
I had the beef lunch and I could barely finish all of the food they served, including steak, two types of noodles, mushrooms, taro root, etc
Definitely ask to try a variety of the sauces
My mouth is watering just thinking about their chili pepper sauce
You get huge quantities of healthy food that tastes so delicious AND it's such a good deal!!!! This place is definitely my new favorite!
Shabu shabu is a fun and delicious!!! way to cook your own food
Great for a date or a group of 4
Just opened, and this place will definitely take off
The Scene Elegant dark wood tables, comfortable circular booths and aged brick walls with glowing tea lights make for a cozy and intimate dining atmosphere
The open bait bar displays the fresh choices of the day and visually lends to the subtle aquatic theme
Service is warm and helpful
The Food The restaurant boasts an impressive raw bar and samplings from the bait menu a big draw
Spanish mackerel with delicate jalapeno and golden raisin puree is an excellent choice along with a daily selection of fresh clams and oysters
Other notable starters include charbroiled octopus white bean salad and spicy tuna tartar seasoned with capers
Main courses like the lobster risotto and seared tuna with mustard sauce are stand-outs
Don't miss the inventive desserts, particularly roasted banana with dulce de leche sauce and caramel gelato
We'd been walking by this place in our neighborhood for the longest time and finally got around to trying it
The crowd is a bit uppity, so there's really no scene to speak of (think cableknit sweaters)
The wait staff are nice and attentive
The menu is pricey (mid 20s for most dishes)
It is tasty, although not as imaginative as others have said
They use a ton of butter to make things tasty, which masks the true flavor of seafood and is a shame
Skip the salads, they are small and nothing special and very expensive
Overall, we thought this place was just okay
We have had far better fish on our many visits to other places in the neighborhood, such as Zeytin
The fish was very good, and the service was fine
A little cramped at a table by the door, but reasonably priced for the quality of the food
I live across the street from this place and never would have thought of stepping in until my friend told me about it
The outside really does not do it justice - looks like an outdated lounge from the outside
But inside is amazing food, service and ambiance
It's pricy so I like to wait for my parents to come in town to take me but one of the very great restaurants popping up on the UWS
Request a booth if you go and make reservations!
The Upper West Side has a restaurant to rave about- and worthy of a the trip uptown!   After a a series of not-so-impressive meals at new restaurants, I can't say enough positive things about The Neptune Room
From the cocktails (tasty pear martinis!) to the decor (cosy banquettes and wood panels) to the food (oh
the food!) to the service (exceptionally knowledgeable waiter who perfectly described the seared fluke special), we were impressed on all fronts
The Bait Bar is irresistible: amazingly fresh fish and creative preparations
We could have eaten nothing but this all evening and still been satisfied
We argued over whose entree was better (whole fish vs
cod vs
fluke) and still managed to taste three desserts (hands down winner: roasted bananas)
A trip uptown to try the brunch is definitely on the calendar!
The quality of the owner's other restaurant- Jane in Soho- in itself justified a visit
However, they did more than meet my expectations at the Neptune Room, they thoroughly impressed
Although we had to wait a few minutes for our table, the manager bought us a round of drinks and proceeded to take care of throughout the entire meal
We were brought an excellent oyster appetizer, a sparkling desert wine and trio of sorbets all compliments of the kitchen
Everyone was quite pleased with the entrees which included a range of seafood dishes I have not seen on many other NY menus
(I recommend the branzino and crab ravioli
) The service was attentive, the food was excellent and it has an enjoyable ambiance
It is a must-visit if you are in the UWS and certainly worth the trip if you are anywhere else
We came looking for a nice meal to celebrate some good fortune
It turns out that the real good luck was ordering a side of gnocchi
Holy moly
My girlfriend licked the bowl clean
That might be the best thing I've eaten this year
Otherwise dinner was above average, although the raw bar appetizers are overpriced and lower quality
The tuna entree is suprisingly interesting and particularly fresh
Great place and overall excellent experience
The shellfish is fresh and highly recommended
The flounder entree recommended by the waiter, who by the way was very pleasant and knowledgeable, was an outstanding dish
An otherwise bland white fish was so flavorful, prepared slightly golden-toasted on the outside in a light delicious cream sauce
The atmosphere is warm, set in a more classic-infused but contemporary design with exposed brick and hush lighting, conducive to casual conversation and a mature crowd
Notably, the staff all-around was very attentive from the Madre-d to the bar tender to the waiter and bus staff
Seating was prompt and parking was also pretty good
Otherwise, plenty of garages nearby
Will be back soon
BTW-The owner also owns Jane Restaurant on Houston Street, which we learned from the waiter, and also have been to on occasion including Thanksgiving Day a couple of years ago
Great place too!
The Neptune Room is a lively addition to the upper west side
I have been twice already and I will be back
The first time I went with a group of five and we sat in a comfy booth and shared the biggest selection from their Bait Bar
It was fresh, innovative, and delicious
The next time I came with a girl friend and we sat at the bar drank white wine and tried other items from the menu
We had a fabulous time
Get a reservation because this place can be busy, and will only get busier I'm sure
I was very skeptical going in - the prices are high and it looked like it might be a bit pretentious for the neighborhood
However, the food was superb - very interesting combinations
Service was excellent - a little over the top, but it is a new restaurant and they are settling in
The only drawback is it is definitely over-priced for what it is
Still, I will certainly return
The Scene Music throbs and loud chatter reverberates throughout this small, vibrant restaurant
The room's fun, quasi-psychedelic style--shiny reds, oranges, yellows and purples, glowing swirls throughout and vaguely Aztec motif--suits the youngish crowd

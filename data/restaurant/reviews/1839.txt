I have been in many restaurants in Manhattan and have found Five Points to be TOP NOTCH
The service was excellent and the food was devine
The chef stopped at our table and we spoke a bit about the preparation of the meal
The ambience is great since it appears that everyone is enjoying themselves

I came here for Easter brunch around 1:30pm it was very busy and we wanted to sit outside to enjoy the day
The very nice staff honored our request and seated us within 5 minutes
Food was great, Cod and eggs platter, Ricotta fritters were YUMMY!! Great place and staff, I will definetly be back
I've been to Five Points a few times and each time I've had a great dining experience
The menu is quite varied and changes frequently so if you are a regular (which I am quickly turning out to be) you get to try new dishes made with what's fresh and in season
Thankfully they keep a staple of favorites on the menu also--the steak and the chicken are great
Try and leave some room for dessert
The warm chocolate bread pudding and the sticky toffee cake are out of this world
In the summertime they have a great sidewalk patio (not a garden- as was posted in another review) and a very nice bar area
One of the best brunch menus in town
Great Riccota Fritters and Huevos Rancheros
The Caramel French Toast starts out as amazing but tends to seem too rich and too sweet by the time you are half way in (hey do you really need to finnish that much french toast anyway)
After Spain their version of Churros and Chocolate did not do it for me but others seemed to be enjoying it
I'd definitely go back and try other things on the menu
The first time I visited Five Points was for the Sunday brunch I'd heard so much about
Suffice to say it was nothing short of exceptional
Great atmosphere,creative menu,friendly staff, the whole nine
I've been back many times since
Upon having dinner there I realized how extraordinary this place is
Some friends and I went on a Thursday night,no reservation,it was hoppin'
We weren't sure we'd even get a table,surprisingly the lovely hostess assured us she'd get us in if we gave her 15 minutes in the bar
We obliged,settled at a bar table and enjoyed some delicious specialty martinis
Within 15 minutes we were seated
The food was heavenly
Some really fabulous dishes, from the striped bass to the oxtail gnocchi,to the buttermilk chicken,eveything was delectable!There's something for everyone,an innovative menu which upon leaving,was pleased to discover changes nightly
Don't even think about leaving until you've tried the chocolate bread pudding
Five Points I'll be back,just try and keep me away!
A group of us went for a birthday dinner
The food was great
The service was excellent
We are all looking forward to going back again in the near future
Plan your dinner selection to allow room for the best chocolate fondue on the planet
The food is never bad, and even though the place is crowded, the service is outstanding
I have gone there many times
The food is always fresh and innovative, but will still satisfy your need for familarity--if in that mood
The menu is varied enough that everyone can find something special
The deserts are great, as well
The staff is very welcoming
They make every guest feel special
Be it for a night on the town or if you want to sit in the bar and slurp or sulk through your supper
A great place to take guests
Five Points is the place to go
Five points pulls off an impressive combination of relaxing hip atmosphere, an innovative menu, delicious food, attentive friendly service, and reasonable prices
brunch: The churros are gourmet, which sounds like a bit of a contradiction
Churros at Five Points are light as a feather and not greasy
Definately spend the extra $2 for the excellent Mexican Hot Chocolate for dunking
The baked eggs with tomato and cheese are very good
Dinner, the soups are excellent
Their beer batter fried onion rings are amazing
I had a very good and fairly priced burger with very sharp and flavorful cheddar and thick bacon
My companion had a wonderful salad
Drinks: Their flavored martinis are quite nice, but a little pricy at $10
The sangria is the best I've had outside of Spain--they use very good dry wine and fresh fruit
Go for a pitcher
Excellent brunch - interesting menu that most foodies would find very intriguing
The cocktails are great - spring for a pitcher or two of the mimosas (could be a bit stronger, but still delicious)
Service was very attentive
Five Points always has new great dishes to choose from - my latest - the sea bass was fantastic
I enjoy going often to see what the chef comes up with
I love love love this restaurant
It is amazing
The food is always great, always seasonal, fresh well prepared
The prices are amazing for the quality
I had great chantarelle mushrooms from the wood burning oven, the best short rib in town and chocolate bread pudding from heaven
The resaurant is also drop dead beautiful
They go out of there way to make every diner feel special
Excellent food for a really fair price
Service always makes me feel welcomed and remembered
One of our favorite NYC restaurants
Highly reccomend
maybe the brunch is good, but dinner at this place was overpriced and only fair
Five Points is a great place for drinks, dinner or brunch
It is just what you want in you in a neighboorhood place and definately worth trip from other parts of the city just to see their stream in the dining room
Very relaxing, sensuous decor
The exposed kitchen, well, I don't know about that, but everthing else is lush
The food was tasty, especially the chocolate fondue
Service is sketchy sometimes
This was such a find on a night when my friend and I were unsure of what we wanted
Their menu does change frequently, but their signature dish (buttermilk chicken) is a must-have
The wait staff was so friendly, and never rushed you along no matter how busy they got
I'm going back over and over again!
Food is very good, with an ever changing menu, reflecting what's best and freshest in the market
It is complemented by a well chosen, well priced wine list
Service is friendly and helpful
The look is nice, but they should lose the music which detracts from the overall experience
This is my new usual place
i dine out a lot
so many places are boring or used to
I like Five Points for few reasons: 1
option to sit outside (sidewalk) or bar or restraurant or a large group table near the kitchen i like having options 2
friendly services (no snobs, no stiff waiters)  3
ABOVEALL: I love their foods
on the menu seems same ol' stuff but their seasonings stand out tickles your taste buds
they deserve more recognition but lets not -- i dont want to share with too many ppl
i find myself going there all the times

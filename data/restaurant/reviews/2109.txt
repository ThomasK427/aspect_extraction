Friendly service, nice owners
a boon to the neighborhood
Some good food too
Most restaurants ban dogs outright, citing health regulations (though there is a peculiar exemption for assistance dogs, which for some reason do not pose a health threat)
Isn't it odd that despite this supposed threat to human health and welfare we as a species have managed to survive, even thrive, for millenia with dogs at our tables
Cheers to the Grey Dog for this simple act of civil disobedience
Further proof that this is THE place for a true blue mug of boho java
The Grey Dog is exceptional in both its service, wait staff attitude, and the fabulous breakfasts
Once you have a cup of their coffee, you'll never go anywher else again
The best cup of coffee in the city
No chain coffee shop could ever be as good, in terms of menu, quality of food, ATMOSPHERE, service
Grey Dog is to Starbucks as Al PAcino is to Carrot Top
Amazing breakfast food - even something as basic as oatmeal is superb here
For five years the Grey Dog's Coffee has anchored Carmine Street's amazingly varied restaurant scene
Their secret? Simply great food at competitive prices
From huge omlets to gigantic sandwitches to the best coffee in NY, the Grey Dog is a great place to eat
The home of the new quot;Carmine Street Cognoscentiquot; that other restaurants could take a lesson from
I can't rave enough about their coffee, their sandwiches or their management! Everything I have ever ordered has been done to perfection and done as if they put a lot of thought into it
From the extra cheese I ask to be put on my Philly to the not too sweet way I like my Smoothies
They definitely know how to work it!
Grey Dog's is known for their coffee but the best kept secret about this Urban Must is the food
Give the club sandwich a shot or an omelet for the early morning hours
The coffee is superb but plan on eating brunch or lunch when you go
You can't make reservations and this place is packed on the weekends
Bring your dog on a leash and expect a wait in the early hours
Prices are reasonable, service is good and the location is fantastic
Cannot believe that this little place in the village can turn out some of the best coffee
Eventhough I am a starbucks fan, this is the goods
The breakfast is really good too
Owners are nice and everytime I go in there is is packed
The bread
Some of the best bread in New York City, really
They make nice sandwiches, sure, but the bread is even better by itself, or with jam and butter and a hot beverage
When GD first opened, I would go there several times a day just to sit and watch people and drink coffee; it was absolutely wonderful
Now, I think it's a bit too much of a scene -- too crowded, too loud, too cool
But it's still a good place to go for a glass of wine and a snack, and there are always interesting/ridiculous conversations to eavesdrop on
And when it's not at its busiest, it feels like a real neighborhood hangout -- very comfortable for vacationers and Midwestern transplants
As I mentioned before, this place simply is the best
You can find in it wonderful Croissants in a delicate French style, with a delicious Italian flavor and a teaspoon of Spanish love in the dedication and elaboration of your products
Also I have found in this formidable place, fat free and sugar free pastries
I was sooo extatic when I found this little bake shop
A bit of nostalgia
Amazing baked goods! Simple but sooo delicious
Their coffee is oh-so-good and cheap! I love this place
The best apple turnover in the City!
You've got to wade through the line that's almost always at this place during peak hours (not really a good place to sit at those times)
It doesn't look like much from the outside, and the pastry display cases near the entrance also look a little sad, but the stuff near the front is always good and they're usually sold out of muffins and such at the end of the day, so I'm not the only one who likes them
Cheerful folks behind the counter too
When hungry and limited on time, try Village Pizza
The slices and calzones are both good and the staff is quick and accomodating
My favorite is the pepporoni slice
Right out of the oven upon your request provides the freshness needed for a top flight slice
The Scene Located at the mouth of the main Bleecker Street drag, Joe's is a perpetual melee of activity
There are a few small tables crammed into the dingy space, if you're really set on eating here
But most people order pie delivery or grab a slice to go
The Food Most of New York's top pizza joints don't serve slices, and most of New York's slice palaces serve pizza with cheese oozing off the pie
Joe's occupies a crucial middle ground, churning out crisp, thin-cut slices with just the right amount of cheese bubbling lightly on top
It's best to stick with the plain slice; extra toppings tend to get thrown on carelessly
Pies are a different story--pepperoni, mushroom and other staples are properly cooked through, in large or small sizes
There's Sicilian, too
When they say New York has the best pizza, they definitely must be talking about Joes
No matter where I am in the city, when I get an urge for a slice I will travel to Joes
The crust, cheese sauce are perfect
Nothing beats it in my opinion
Get the fresh mozzarella slice
heaven!
I have been frequenting Joes in Brooklyn which has the exact same amazing pizza until i finally had the opportunity to visit the original place
This pizza is perfect
It is the most perfect crust I have ever had and they are very generous with the toppings which are thrown on top last minute
Make sure to have their fresh mozz slice and be prepared to wait for awhile on the weekends- it is beyond woth it
In the middle of Carmine St
appears as a small pizza joint, with only a single table and three counters for customer space
The entire place looks modestly kept, and one would not know of the great reputation it carries
I ordered a slice, and it was out to me, hot and fresh
As I walked over to one of the counters in the restaurant, another person coming in accidentally knocked my pizza face down onto the floor
The first thing I heard was not an apology from the man, but an offer from the cashier to give me another slice
And let me tell you, once I finally was able to enjoy it in peace, it was well worth the $3
00
I enjoyed it so much that I got another slice before I left
Famous Joe's Pizza serves the best pizza in the City
I had to see what all the fuss was about, and I'm glad I did- it was the best pizza I have ever had, and it deserves all the street credit it gets!
Dont go expecting a warm welcome
The servers want you in and out
You wont get any small talk from these guys
I have eaten at this place for years, and its still one of my favorites
There small little park across the street that is always great to sit in ( Its under construction right now) If you are visiting the city, make sure you hit this place!
Joe's pizza is the best in the NYC
I used to work on Varick Street and would go there for lunch, that was my first time and I've been going back there ever since (I left my job on Varick in 2000 plus I live in Brooklyn) I would purposely get on the train to go to Joe's from Brooklyn
I have my whole family liking the pizza
The chese and sauce is perfect together and the crust is baked to perfection
The decor is plain and there is no seating, but going there to get a slice is worth it
All the years I've been going to Joe's, the pies that come out of the oven quickly vanishes within 10 minutes
I've never seen a pie just sit there waiting for someone to buy a slice
It's just incredible and I want to thank Joe for such delicious pizza!
I went to joes on my first trip to NYC and was pleased
I had heard about it via a friend who lives in NYC and decided to go
It was about 1:30 on a saturday and the place wasnt crowded
I had no trouble getting seats
THe pizza was excellent and a great value!
The pizza was very thin and it was slightly burnt

Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down
It's all about the food !!
Planet Thai offers some of the best spicy tuna in town
I have regular cravings that are tantamount to an addiction
Besides the sushi, I believe that some of their best offerings can be found on the specials menu
Thus I suggest you take the time to peruse it because this is where you will find a number of hidden treasures
These rare treats change daily, though if we are fortunate enough some dishes will make repeat appearances
Planeat Thai is hands down my Williamsburg staple for food
I love their sushi and habachi grill
Over the last four years, since they opened in the newer, bigger space, the food has had many fun evolutions
My least favorite evolution is their increase in prices (about 1-2 bucks on everything), and their cutting back on accompaniments (japanese entrees used include both soup and salad, now it is either, or)
Another change that bothers me is that they no longer offer low sodium soy sauce
However, they still use the green low-sodium bottles (a little misleading, don't you think?) Bottom-line the food's still great, but they have decided to give you less food for more money
And no more low sodium soy
I still love to go!
big restaurant
very roomy
good for big groups
decent prices
but theres a long wait sometimes
food is average
This place looks like an old warehouse/factory, and the menu suggests the same: hundreds of items, a fair amount of Thai dishes and a plethora of sushi, rolls, and other Japanese goodies
I had the coconut seafood soup, which was good, and the curry was adequate
Service was not terrible, if not superlative
Would go again, if in the area
OK, here it begins: 1-Waitress would not tell me what drinks from the bar were available
2-Our appetizers main course were served together
3-Unless we repeatedly asked, soiled plates were not removed from the table
WE HAD TO DO IT OURSELVS! 4-Got attitude from the waitress at every moment she was at the table
5-Quality of the food is less than what it once was
I Had The Pleasure Of Dining Here 'YEARS' Before The Masses Caught On
If The Same Can Be Said Today, This Restaurant Had Their Stuff Together Since 1995/6
GREAT FOOD, ATMOSPHERE AND MOST OF ALL PRICE
REALLY GOOD FOOD FOR NEXT TO NOTHING
IF YOUR GOING ON THE WEEKEND PREPARE TO WAIT IT GETS VERY CROWDED
i love planet thai
it's a great place to grab some really good food in my neighborhood
however - the service is the worst i've ever experienced ANYWHERE
i'm beginning to think it's a prerequisite to getting hired and possibly a reason the price is so cheap
go there and get really good food, just don't expect to get out of there quickly and when the server comes to your table ask for everything you'll be needing for the rest of the evening
bring flares for when you're ready for the check
they have very selective eye sight towards the end of your meal
In my few visits to Planet Thai the food has always been good to excellent
As for me, I've never had a problem with the service
But then again, I'm not looking for conversation or even a smile from the help--just give me my Thai and make sure it's good
And it is good
The only complaint I have is that for all the customers they feed nightly, they still don't accept credit cards
The first time I ate there I had to use their godforsaken ATM and pay them an extra 2 bucks for the privilege
(Made me rethink the tip on that occasion
) Other than that, it's a great restaurant for a spicy dinner after work or with a gang of friends on the weekend
I'm still trying to understand the DJ spinning vinyl next to the kitchen, but I'll be back
I love planet thailand! It's cheap yummy -what more do you need?? A lot of reviews talk about bad service, but we've never had problems
NOW it's a waste of time to go there
I've been there about 7 or 8 times, varying days of the week and with different people each time
Sometimes the food was great, sometimes, just OK
But the last 2 times I went, it was just plain bad
And I have had enough of the AWFUL SERVICE
Forget about the hostesses screaming out names at the bar for parties to be seated
I mean SCREAMING
But how about the completely unaccomodating staff? Ordered a Grey Goose and Pineapple around 6pm on a Friday
My server said, We're saving the pineapple juice for when it gets busier
Another time, I asked for a few extra limes with my pad thai
My server that day asked, What for? Why you need more? Should be called PLANET WACK
While I cannot take credit for coining such a phrase, an individual at our table of 7 came up with this brilliant 2 word description for Planet Thailand
'Planet Dookie' was a complete accurate description for our entire dining experience
I've been here a couple of times and each time the service was different
Sometimes I got my food promptly with no problems, other times I had the worst possible service where I had to wait an hour for my food (although that time the waiter was new)
The consistent thing about this restaurant is their food
My friends loved the combination platters, while I enjoyed their curry
I did try the thai spring roll once which tasted bland and gross, but otherwise, the food was good
I have been here twice with my sister
I like the atmosphere to the place
It is never crowded but it seems like it is
One thing is that they DO NOT take credit card (the last time I went anyway)
My sister ended up using the ATM in the bank which charged her $2
And guess where that $2 was going (according to the ATM message) to Planet Thailand
My sister didn't think that was fair so she took the cash out anyway and just deducted the $2 from the tip
The waitress took our drink order
Another waiter attempted the same but couldnt understand that wed already ordered
The drink order got screwed up
Then an appetizer arrived wrong one - sent back and corrected
The entrees arrived BEFORE the rest of the appetizers
My entre was wrong - was sent back and corrected
Then the rest of the appetizers arrived partway through the entre
But soon, the manager arrived and apologized for everything and gave us a round on the house
He seemed like a nice and genuine man
The food was delicious and quite inexpensive
Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price
My wife had decent service last time she went
The food was good enough that we might even be back
Th Hot and Sour Shrimp Soup at this restaurant is absolutely fantastic
The soup is mostly just broth with a few shrimp and mushrooms thrown in, but it's amazing
One the better flavors that has ever rolled across my tongue
It's quite amazing that this place dares to be so nasty all the way in Oklahoma
It takes 2 hours to get there
The food is good and cheap BUT the attitudes of the bartender and wait staff are almost unbearable
I seriously think this place has a good thing going, if only it would re-staff and hire some decent human beings
I sometimes go here when in the area and though the food is always great, the Basil Chicken and Shrimp Tempura roll in particular, the service has much to be desired

Decor there is really Japanese
They also have tatami place (the room that you can sit on floor
) Waitresses wear kimono
It's ok to go there once a while if you want to impress someone (it's pricy
we are two girl and we paid 100 in total
)
The Scene With an otherwise hotel-lobby feeling, the dim lights, fresh flowers and flawlessly set tables make this an elegant place
Since it's located in the Daily News Building, it's not surprising that the the two rooms are full of journalists at lunch
At night, residents from Tudor City make this their dining room away from home
Service is extremely knowledgeable and friendly
The Food Two former chefs from the Sign of the Dove have created a Tuscan-inspired menu that changes seasonally
Expect fresh produce--fava beans, fiddlehead ferns, peaches and vine-ripe tomatoes--to appear in inventive recipes, such as peach butter served with the foie gras appetizer
An onion marmalade tart, served with smoked duck carpaccio, is a highlight
Lobster Newburg, baked in polenta, is outstanding
Desserts include chocolate souffle and peach cobbler
Great food, great service and great decor
If you want ultra-private, ultra-romantic request a booth
The service is knowledegable, friendly and very accomadating while the food was delicious and the wine was even better!   I highly recommend making the trip
I'm so glad I live only a short cab ride from Cibo
It's the perfect place for my business lunch meetings and getting together with my friends
This is the only sane oasis I've found just block's from Grand Central
The kitchen is consistently on the money - I've yet to have a bad meal there
One time my pork chop was a little underdone and it was just a few minutes before I was tearing into it again
The prices are tame by NYC standards and I'm a big fan of whatever they're offering by the glass, for wine
Very comfortable and chic, too
I was recently at cibo for a holiday corporate event and I was amazed with how wonderful everything was
It inspired me to return a few weeks later and I was again thoroughly impressed
Called for reservation for 5 - got there on time, no reservation noted = no table ready! Salads were wilted and brown - Pastas were ice cold - pre-cooked and microwaved and all the dinners were served lukewarm, including supposedly fresh fish
The service was terrible and the only one working hard was the busboy serving water
Very disappointing and an expensive mistake to go here
i cant figure how this one got a 9
3 rating! total tourist trap, way way over price for its value, microwave quality food, cutleries and plates are blurry and somewhat not restaurant caliber
old and tired!
This is my favorite restaurant in NYC
The service and food are superb
Equally capable of handling dinner for two, a large party of 10 or more, or, they will close for a private party
Their menu changes seasonally and is excellent
Try the mussels, sliced Burrata mozzerella salad, any fish dish (especially the soft shell crabs, my favorite), all the desserts
A very good price fixe, for lunch and dinner
Brunch is great, includes many items from their regular menu, and is a very good value
Try it--these people will make you feel truly cared for
The place was so snotty, too expensive and It was Valentines day to boot! The food had to taste for how much money I paid!
Lets face it, there are few restaurants in the 40s on the East side, with many bad places
This place is one of the few places where I know I will be happy with my meal
I have been to Cibo numerous times, even on Thanksgiving one time and have always been satisfied overall
No the service is not like a 5 star French restaurant, but it is average
One time the air conditioning was blowing right on our table, making it uncomfortable and they took care of the problem
Between myself and everyone I have taken to this restaurant, we have never had a bad dish
Having eaten there a number of times in the past, I recommended it confidently and took a party of 12 clients
Dinner, service was fine but unfortunately, we were in a corner which was quite overheated
My clients were sweating, mopping their brows, etc
One of the wait staff enthusiastically agreed that it was indeed quite hot at our table
No attempt was made to adjust the heat
Afterward, the senior member of the party provided his Diner's card to pay the check and was advised 'we don't take Diner's over $500'
This is especially annoying as acceptance of Diner's was one criteria for selecting Cibo
Guess they would have been happier if we gave them 12 Diner's cards and told them to split the check 12 ways
I won't return or recommend the restaurant again
I had visitors from out of town and all 11 of us went to Cibo for Saturday brunch
There was no one at the door greeting us to start with and the waiter didn't seemed to care about us at all
The waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink until 20 mins after we got seated and he never came back to explain why the food didn't come out for another hour
I understand that preparing food for 11 people can take some time but, we would've appreciated some attention
Letting the costomers know what's going on and be attentive is one of the basic things a restaurant should offer
Best restaurant in the neighborhood
Always good
The menu is seasonal, which makes me confident you're dealing with a real kitchen
The service is proficient and equally real
I'm especially impressed with the gorgeous decor: fresh cherry blossoms, abundant flowers and candles on the tables
What's not to like?
I have been at cibo for lunch in Feb 2002 and I wasn't really crazy about the food
I had the rugula salad and the rib-eye steak, which were both very plain and not exciting at all
However, the pana cotta was great
Overall, not a good value
The Prix Fixe is an unbelievable deal and the food is great no matter what you order - the wine list could be better - but there is something to suit most palates
The atmosphere is where CIBO really wins - it has a very stuylish bar in the back and a cozy dining room to the left as you enter and a more expansive room to the right
the decor is tasteful but trendy
you feel as if you are at a much more expensive restaurant
only downer is it is occasionally closed for private parties
The brunch, which begins at 11:30am, was delightful
The prix fixe and a la carte menus had appealing options and the service was attentive
Of particular note was the Maitre D', who treated me and my party of 20-somethings with as much respect as the older customers, which seems to be rare at some of the finer restaurants in town
The atmosphere was quite sophisticated, simple yet elegant and not too stuffy
I look forward to going back for brunch and trying it out for dinner sometime
2nd Ave and 41st is not an area bustling with fine restaurants, but this is a destination, not just a happen upon
Any salad with seafood in it is worth a trip from California! And they are one of the (very) few restaurants in the city who actually know how to prepare duck properly and know the main ingredient in a crab cake is about 80% crab! The service is consistently superb- they are casual, but smooth in delivery and attention to detail
Go out of your way for this one and let's hope for CIBO II in the future
They got it right
Oh- and their bar is even more of a treasure- large enogh to be comfortable, but not a loud scene
great for singles or a group
We enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service
Going back very soon
You will not be disappointed! The 5 of us ate off of the Prix Fixe menu and were completely satified
Attentive, knowledgable wait staff
Extensive menu choices
Fantastic confection creations
We chilled, were filled and thrilled with our dining experience
Will definitely go back
We actually, did NOT have the greatest service because our waiter (polish or hungarian or something - NOT Italian) didn't speak any english, but mt pasts was tasty and my friends chicken was also delicious
Decent Food at a decent price in a cute, tidy restaurant with cute Luna Blue (Moon Motif) plates
Nice (Albeit tiny) bar area, too
The food was delicous and atmosphere is very warm and inviting

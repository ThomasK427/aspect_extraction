The problem was that the air conditoning was not working well
For an expensive restaurant like this there is no excuse to have customers sweating during dinner
The food was just ok
No way worth the price
For two people: ($270 for the tastings menu, and two drinks and tip)
I will not be going back
Thank you Tom Colicchio you have managed to pull off a wonderful establishment where food, service and value rank way up there! A treat from start to finish
Every course was innovative and delish, even the complementary offerings between courses were wonderful
Gracious, diligent, unobstrusive only begin to describe the service
Gosh, even the nicely wrapped chocolate ribbon muffins they gave us with the bill intended for the next morning's breakfast were the best I have ever had (and who does that anayway??)
This is what a dining experience should be, others need to take notes
Simply, the best in NYC!
Sorry for such a nasty headline but I would feel horrible if you were a NYC visitor and read a negative review here and decided not to go to Gramercy Tavern
As many have so eloquently said before, this is simply the perfect New York restaurant
They take food and service very seriously
It's popular for good reason
It's popularity is its only drawback
It ain't cheap, but that's isn't the point
The good news is, it isn't ridiculously expensive and it is definitely worth the money
The food in the bar is great if you just want to check it out without a reservation
Anything negative that is said about this God-send of a dining experience is an insult to people who love fine dining
P
S
They have an under-rated cheese service if you are so inclined
An evening to remember
Their tasting menu was superb, service at its finest, we were immersed in true luxury for the shortest 2
5 hours I can remember
Ah wait, Jean Gorges is up there too
Well done
Come to Gramercy Tavern experience their Pirx Fix Dinner
There's no words but just tastebuds of DELIGHT! Everything is so amazing, the details, the service, impeccable food combination, the experience is simply unforgettable
Don't miss out on celebrating a special occasion here, this place is simply not to be missed!!!! Every thing rocks, the appetizers, entrees exquisite desserts
You would not be disappointed!
Gramercy Tavern met and exceeded all of my expectations
The service was on point and non-obtrusive
The cuisine was an experience in subtle blendings of tastes and textures which wowed my palate
Overall, it was a great dinner and a reminder of all that NYC fine dinning can and should be
Make sure you order dessert
delicious!!!!
My boss and I recently spent 8 days in NYC on business
We are always looking for good restaurants
We read reviews and ask around
What a pleasure to find The Gramercy Tavern
The entire evening was beond good
The service, food, the ambience all combined to make it our favorite experience of the trip
I heard the hype and had to see for myself
I went to the tavern, not the back restaurant
First the good: the food is interesting and innovative
I had the striped bass which was quite good, my chocolate soufle was also excellent
My companion, a vegetarian, had a nice combination of the vegetable appetisers
Best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted
The not so good: the wine selection by the glass--especially the reds, is disappointing
The appetisers were just ok
If you're going to spend this money, I'd expect a little more
The Valentine's Day dinner was the nicest dining experience I've had in years
We were seated promptly, the waiter acted truly interested and eager to give the best service he could
The entire meal - 3 hours worth - was worth the price
The desserts were fabulous, and the coffee cake reminded us the next morning how much we had enjoyed the evening
Thank you
The service was outstanding
The staff was very friendly and helpfull
Unfortunately, the food was overpriced
It was exceptional
but not worth what I ended up paying
You can usually count on this place for great, cordial service and delicious food
Was there for Restaurant Week lunch and impressed by wide selection available for each course
The appetizers were nice; my halibut ceviche didn't have much of a bite - but luckily I love sushi, so it tasted great to me
The entrees were both too salty, but the lamb shank was pretty tasty
The desserts were too sweet, so that you can only eat about 1/3, but well-made and pleasing to the eye
I'll definitley be back and do the prix fixe dinner; I can bet the quality is even better then
I went to Gramercy Tavern for the first time with some house guests and I have to say that I was a little disappointed
I guess I just expected a little more from such a highly rated restaurant
My appetizer was amazing and it was the braised veal shank with gnocchi, but my main course was monkfish and it was very bland
The waitress was a little rude and wasn't very helpful esp with the wine selection and I was surprised that there was no sommelier
The desserts were all great and the atmoshere was wonderful, but I just thought that a person should enjoy anything they order from a place like this and this was not the case with me or my guests
A wonderful place
On the last night of our winter vacation in New York, we wanted a special place to go
Grammercy Tavern was it
We were seated in the more rustic/formal dinning room, but the bar area would be fun too
The waiter was very kind, the food fantastic, yet still interesting and the service is pretty much the best I've ever experienced
GREAT place to have a wonderful meal
Agree with the other reviewer - good place for to take a parent or a date
I'm a born and raised NYC foodie and this place continues to top my list of favorites
Amazing food - every dish is unique and delicious, every bite is wonderful
The menu is sophisticated, but at the same time accessible, the atmosphere is elegant and but at the same time cozy
Staff is superb
Excellent for any occasion - whether taking your parents out for a special meal - or your lover out for a romantic dinner
If you arrive by 7:00 you can almost always quickly get a table in the front tavern room with no reservation!
I've eaten here a few times and it's always good
The eligantly rustic decor grounds the restaurant from being too fancy and pretentious
The milkshake that accompanies the chocolate dessert MUST be upgraded to an adult size -- BIGGER is BETTER!
This restaurant is not just about the food, although that was very tasty
The ambience is peaceful, and feels like you are in a colonial farm house
It was not tightly packed, and there are constant edible bonuses coming out of the kitchen to surprise and please you
YES, it is expensive, but this place will impress your guests, and you'll enjoy it too
We did!
i've eaten at gramercy tavern 4x's in the last year it's always a treat
for service alone, an area where many restaurants fall ridiculously short these days, it's still the best place in town
sure, everybody has off nights, but i've never experienced one at gramercy
colicchio's food is always very satisfying, he never goes for style over substance, the wine list is decent, another downfall of many area restaurants

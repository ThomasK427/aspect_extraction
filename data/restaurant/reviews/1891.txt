Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable
Somewhat crowded, but laid back bar scene if you want to grab a drink before or after dinner
The ambiance in the dining room was nice as well, good date place
IMHO, this is one of the BEST restaurants in the city
My boyfriend and I went on a busy night and were not impressed - especially for such a lofty price tag
The waiter was a unattentive and forgetful, not to mention that the booths are very uncomfortable
The food was not memorable - the snapper too dry and the boiled potatoes too wet but equally flavorless
We thought that dessert would make up for the previous courses, but the chocolate cake left much to be desired
I will say that my one cosmopolitan (only one because the waiter was not around to offer me another) was fantastic!
Went there for a date the other night, what an atmosphere
the vibe is just unbelievable, and so are their sweets
you HAVE to try their WARM CHOCOLATE TART for all the chocolate lovers out there its truly heavenly, and the service was great
the bar tender is adorable
Thanx
I took my wife out for our anniversary dinner there, the whole evening was just perfect, she couldnt be happier
from the hostess, to the servers, we were treated like kings
The monkfish was so tender, and scrumptous
we know were we're going back to
ok so this it, i have found my spot
if you want to sit down in a great and relaxed atmosphere cub room is it, we stopped by there this afternoon, sat there in one of the booths
eating thier fish and chips, which bytheway
best i've tasted yet
and drinking a smooth cocktail
great place! thanx
Had such a fantastic time tonight! Our server was so sweet and the food was exceptional
The chef even came over to the table and chatted a bit
Will definetely go back!   ps
the creme brulee was to die for
My friends took me out to the CUB ROOM for my birthday, it was such a fabulous time
We had such a good time, my first time there
The music was mesmerizing, we didnt want to leave
The chef came to our table with my birthday cake and it was quite delicious
i am a very hard critic, but wow they've surprised me
just beautiful, everything
cub room cafe - service was horrible - slow, inattentive is an understatement - their version of a glass of wine is 1/2 a glass - and although we were only a group of 4, they added a 20% tip to the bill (which was not mentioned beforehand or on the menu) - when we questioned the manager about it - he couldn't care less that we had been dissatisfied by the service and did not want to leave 20% - he was more than rude - Im never going back
Cub room is my favorite Dinner restaurant in NYC
I've taken numerous people to Cub room and recommended others and it never fails to impress people by the quality of the food and the ambience
Nothing beats this place for overall quality and quantity of amazing Dinner
Service times were atrocious
I waited an hour for food and that was the better part of the service
I ordered a medium Cub burger and it came out well done, not that my server would have noticed since we didn't see her again until she brought the check
We had a great time with the family, great atmosphere, and the food, oh the food!! the beet goat cheese salad was amazing start and the filet mignon has never been done better
I wont even get started on the desserts
great location too! bravo cub room and chef!
We have been to the Cub Room for drinks a few times and have always enjoyed ourselves
Last night we came for dinner
Let me say that this place has it right
We ordered the duck and it was awesome
When it came to the dessert, our server suggested the special(chocolate torte with macadamia nut ice cream) and it was AWESOME!! I have to say the whole experience was great
My only complaint are the drink prices
I don't think that a Gray Goose vodka with pineapple juice should be $10
as delicious as the food was, and as charming as the dining room was, neither made up for the 1 hour wait for our table AND subsequent 1 hour wait for our entrees
based on the citysearch reviews, i had high hopes for the cub room
unfortunately, my friends and i all left truly disappointed in what COULD have been a very nice dinner
I went to the cub room for the first time last week with a group of friends
The atmosphere is warm with lots of class, but it is not so upscale that you feel uncomfortable
We had a 8 or 9 course dinner with a different wine with each course
The food was fabulous, the wine was exciting, the dessert was a treat for the palate
The waitstaff was attentive, but not vulture-like
It was one of the best meals I have ever had in New York
I would highly recommend this restaurant
My wife and I recently celebrated our 20th anniversary with a weekend in NY and dinner at The cub room
We couldn't have chosen a finer restaurant
The restaurant is romantically decorated in red, the staff was professional, friendly and attentive to our every whim
The food was magnificent as each mouthful was better than the last
Highly recommended
Dinner for two, champagne and tip was approximately $155
00
Try the potato latke
very good
The server was very friendly and we weren't rushed
In nice weather they open the front
Cub Room has a great weekend brunch
Make sure you try their biscuts
Their eggs and bacon is great
Their lunch menu is good too
They have the freshest salads
I went for a late lunch today and was very impressed
Great room to do business as ambience is calm and there's room to stretch out
the lunch options were great and my salad and sandwich were fantastic
Seems like nice ownership as well
I love Suzie's for the comfortable atmosphere and the decent prices
However, the food is heavily Americanized so don't expect authenticity
(The food isn't bad, just not Chinese
) The service is alright
I like their takeout- they're very thoughtful and the food is still hot when it gets to you
The food is pretty good, the lunch specials are fantastic, the staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean and pleasant, and the delivery in unbelievably fast
Overall, it's by far the best chinese restaurant around
I liked this restaurant's food and service within the restaurant
BUT the delivery men are RUDE!! If you like the delivery man breathing over your shoulder to monitor the tip you're giving and telling you what you're giving isn't enough, or having money SNATCHED out of your hand without a word, this is the restaurant for you
I was a customer for 3 years, but these incidents have happened 3 times in the past 2 months, and I'm tired of being disrespected
I'll never give my money to Suzie's or their mean delivery guys again
Believe me, there are other good Chinese restaurants in the area!
I've eaten here, and I have had food delivered from here many times, and I have never been dissapointed
The food has always been good, and the people there are very helpful
The prices are very reasonable and competitive with prices from most other similar restaurants
There are places where you can get a meal for less, but you pay for it in terms of the quality of the food
If you want good Chinese food for a reasonable price, then come to Suzie's and give it a try
I have to say, I have gone to quite a few chinese restaurants, and this one blows all the others out of the water
EVERYTHING that I or my friends and family have ever ordered here is delicious

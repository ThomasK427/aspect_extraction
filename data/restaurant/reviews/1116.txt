Serving sizes were fine and so was service
Good looking wait staff abound, go for the ambience and exotic cocktails
I dined at this Rest on 9/4/04, the service was completely clueless
drinks took 25 minutes to arrive
the food was served lukewarm
very small portions(this isnt french
its thai), water glasses remained unfilled the entire meal
The food quality was very poor, my jewish mother could have cooked better Thai
Our waitress pulled a david blane and dissapeared after our maincourse only to comeback 30 minutes later after I put out a APB on her
Avoid at all costs!! Very dissapointing
The waiter was genuinely distressed when we told him that we do not eat meat including fish
Just about everything in this restaurant is doused in fish sauce, even the salads
The kitchen staff either cannot or will not accomodate special diets which is surprising given that there are so many fine dining establishments that do have special menus to cater to vegetarians
The drinks and decor were wonderful but unfortunately we could not stay for dinner
YUM! Ambience is equal to Spice Market (love the reflecting pool with floating votives)
Doesn't quite match the feeling of being in Thailand that you get in Spice Market
Food is WAY better - for starters, try the foie gras, rock shrimp, spicy Thai beef and the bluefin tuna carpaccio w/orange soy sauce
Ginger lemongrass highball is a tasty drink, but definitely sweet
Entrees were good also - try a curry dish - the curry w/mixed vegetables is a little deceiving w/eggplant overpowering the dish (needs more veggies), but the sauce was yummy
Don't waste your time at Spice Market - COME HERE!!! Not much compares to Thai food in Bangkok where it costs $3 at the Peninsula Hotel for a YUMMY dinner, but this is sooooo close!
Hate trendy restaurants, loved this one
Excellent food (and I have been to Thailand twice), great service, cool atmosphere and overall just a great vibe
Really looking forward to returning to this one
Walking into the restaurant was almost like walking into Thailand
Beautiful decor
Definitely a place to take a date
The food was so so
The food has potential to be great, but on its first night it was a bit too salty
Maybe give it a few months and the food will be great
the ambiance is already!
While the wait took over an hour (with a reservation!) and the ambience was a little shabby chic
, if still hip/romantic
the food was incredible, and well worth the wait! Service is a little clumsy (we had our place setting set and reset for each course) but sweet and friendly, which made up somewhat for the lack of polish
The menu choices were all varied and appealing and the presentation and execution were excellent! Go for the food, but go ready for a wait!
Wow! unbelievably pleasant surprise
once you've experienced this winner concept, no restaurant in nyc comes close! food is amazing, cocktails spectacular and a friendly priced A quality winelist
service is most pleasant however lacks the routine of a well oiled machine
but the friendlyness of everybody made me totally forget that
in short, possibly the best new restaurant i visited in a while
i'll be back soon
This is one of the best meals I've had in a long time! The food was amazing, and the prices were definitely reasonable
Beautiful decor too
I can't wait to go back!
I stumbled across this great find two weeks ago and have been back 3 times since
The sandwiches are fresh, great tasting, and pretty filling
The chef combines a unique variety of flavors in each sandwich, which really hightens the taste buds
If you are undecided about which sandwich to choose, go for the Indecision, which is a trio of smaller sandwiches on the menu
Last but not least, you have to try the Mac and Cheese
yum, yum! The only downside to this place is the limited seating
Go before 12:30 to beat the crowds
I was working in times sq
for a few months this past fall and the only decent food, to be had quickly, was Carve
Now that my office has moved, I miss the indescision lunch box
I eat at Carve everyday
I just happened on this review page and I couldn't believe that people were talking bad about it!   I've ordered every single thing on the menu and usually have a hard time choosing
They have yummy soups and a 3 cheese macoroni and cheese that is awesome! They also have fresh made scones in the morning that I dream about at night
I invite the people who didn't like to go back and order the Indecision
You will get to taste 3 small verisons of larger sandwiches and maybe you'll find something you like better
Oh yeah, cool staff too!
I try to stop at this great new shop a couple of times a week
Contrary to the reviewer who found the meats inedible--i find them irrestible
They look great and are artfully assembled into really good sandwiches
Most of all they are really real--real chicken, pork, beef and more (soft shell crabs!) Highly recommend--though I, too, wish there was seating
After reading all the opening clippings about Carve, i thought i'd wander down the street from my office and give it a shot
The place was packed but was moving peple through pretty fast
Finally a bright and clean sandwich shop
I order the 4th of July Picnic, the new cobb and an order of the pecan cups
Both sandwiches were awesome
Totally fresh, great bread
I just wish there was a place to sit
It's my new place to eat!!!
I had the pork loin sandwich lunch box special
With a soda my lunch came to $12
75 which I thought was a tad pricey
The lunch box included a loose handful of kettle chips (not in a bag but a handful in the bottom of the box), an underripe peach and an OK choco cheesecake brownie - could havae been sweeter
My pork loin sandwich was very yummy but a little chintzy on the pork and way too much red cabbage
but still tasty
The real winner was my friend's Thanksgiving Dinner sandwich
The turkey was amazing
thickly sliced and juicy with a delicious apple stuffing
I think her lunch with soda came to just over $8
00
So I recommend going a la carte unless you are guaranteed edible fruit and a truly delicious desert
The Scene Futuristic design fuses with colorful warmth at this Thai eatery
Panels of white canvas sit above the banquet; spot lighting utilizes Day-Glo colors, as do the napkins; while baskets with candles and decorative prints provide a serene touch
The extensive menu covers all the basics of Thai cooking, with noodle dishes and vegetarian options well-represented
Duck merits its own section, and a grilled fillet of fish (salmon or tilapia) comes with a choice of six sauces
my opinion is the best thai in newyork
I've been in Thailand numerious times My big complain in Newyork why we do not have such authentic food like in thailand, every restaurant in Newyork mostly loses their flavor and adjust their dished according to Newyorker's taste
And finally this restaurant came along
Every single dish is perfectly done in the right way,the produces are so fresh,sauces are excellent
they definately know what they were doing
the restaurant is very cozy,tastefully decoratedand service is very good,attentive yet not overly done
highly recommend it
I love Teeda
The food is terrific
The best Thai I've had in the Bococa area (God, I hate that word)
And I eat loads of Thai food
I recommend the Thai Fried Rice, the Pad Ki Mao, the Charred Beef Salad, and the Laab Gai salad
Yummmm

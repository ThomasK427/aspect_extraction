white tuna dragon, morgan stanley, mango rolls, baby tako, amaebi, cal
uni, home made ginger dressing salad, banana ice cream temp
are the best tastes we've ever had
I know your menu insideout, so regardless of your love affairs w/ the women in my life, my insatiable love for great sushi is well worth it! You're catering our wedding!!
Dining at Raku was one of the highlights of our trip to Manhattan
Being from Atlanta, we didn't know our way around the city and stumbling upon Raku was something we were very fortunate to have done
We were seated immediatley, the service was great, and the sushi was exceptional
After our meal,the manager, even took some of his time to sit with us and give us a lesson in Sake 101
He allowed us to sample of of his famous milk and thus turned a typical hot sake drinker on to a whole new world of sake
We plan on dropping by Raku on our trips to New York from now on
Thanks for everything!
Wow this place got a 9
0 and Im in total aww
As in awful like the service was
It was average price for a japanese restaurant only everything in this place was below average
Located in a great area if only the food were up to par
Definately would not reccomend
Below averge food
terrible service
and it was like eating in a closet very very small
This place is overrated
I do not understand the high marks this place gets on Citysearch
The service was okay but the food was not abundant or fresh
So many other better japanese restaurants than to waste your money or meal here
The ambiance is one of uncomfortability and it is not so innovative as others say
Don't waste your time here!!
2 yrs ago we came after the Yanks kicked our butts - we drowned our sorrow with great sake sushi
Last yr we came back gloating after our Sox knock their you know what's off I really busted on Ray
This yr
more sorrow
At least his sushi has maintained it's excellent quality so many new rolls were fantastic
Sake that tastes just like water so smooth crisp but oh so dangerous his milk still delish
We repeat that the sushi is world series class (white tuna, firecracker cinco de mayo rolls), Raku can hold their own w/ the best of nyc
Ray will be open 3 yrs we always come back (after the ALCS) home for sushi
We visited Raku as it was close to our hotel, and had some good reviews on this site
It was definately not what i was expecting, but we went inside anyway
I would describe the decor is more irish pub/steakhouse rather than modern sushi
We ordered a bottle of wine, which took ages to arrive
Both sushi novices, Ray the owner guided us expertly through the menu, and made some suggestions
The food was good we ate most of the sushi presented to us
We watched some amazing looking dishes being prepared for other tables
Not sure on value being a londoner, but it didnt seem over the top
Overall, a good meal, but a clear case of one mans beer is another mans whiskey
All depends on your expectation here
Ray definately a top man, but this is by no means a world beating sushi restaurant
As a former resident of Washington D
C
, I journeyed into NYC Midtown looking for the district's Raku, a Asian-fusion comfort food restaurant
I was quite surprised to learn that RAKU - IT'S JAPANESE! has no relation to the D
C
Metro area Raku restaurants
This Raku provided fresh and sumptuous sushi, sashimi, and deliciously prepared cooked entrees, which did much to alleviate my jitters about fishing (or dining, as it were) in unfamiliar waters
With a patient and helpful wait staff and an affable, accommodating owner mixed in, Raku quickly catapulted to the top of my go-to sushi spots
A little off-put by the eclectic background blend of house and techno music, I had an otherwise enjoyable time at this cozy, affordable Midtown haunt
Have been to Raku several times, but never entered a review
My last stop there was so wonderful I decided to put in my 2 cents
This charming little restaurant serves great sushi and the sake selection is great
The staff is very helpful, especially Ray, the owner
This is now my only sushi stop
This place is wonderful - the menu is unique and delicious
You will find me there again and again!
Raku - It's Japanese was as good as my local favorite Sushi restaurant
The ambience and service was wonderful, and the food was fantastic
The special rolls were my favorite followed closely by their seaweed salad
this is now my before theater dining spot
We have tried so many restaurants in the theater district and found them to be lacking in many aspects, but Raku - It's Japanese was near perfect
It's not handicap friendly and definitely not for the kids
Small and intimate
The salad was not leaf lettuce and I thought we were in for some excellent raw fish
I ordered the sashimi deluxe my wife the sushi deluxe
I got 6 different fish, but the cuts were so small it took 2 pieces to get a mouthful
The cuts were so thin I thought I was in one of those all you can eat buffets
Where you get all rice and little fish
My wife agreed with the amount of rice and tiny pieces of fish on her sushi
The dinner cost $66, what I have paid for a boat with at least 45 large pieces of fish
Very dissappointed, and would not recommend except to people I don't like
My wife friends 1st visit to Raku for pre-theater - place is amazing (not the ambiance - it's their food/sushi variety that's superb!!)
Specialty rolls are SOOO AWESOME - mango ray, super gerard, cinco de mayo is hot hot roll, the marina dragon rolls - you can't go wrong! we ordered so much ala carte we almost wiped out their white tuna
Hot foods/vegetarian selections were very good also
My group was well taken care of - espec
w/ his famous milk
But overheard Ray speaking w/ another couple at sushi bar about opening in Roslyn replacing Maguro (b
t
w
overpriced but excellent sushi)
We concur!! Ray if you do, we can refer you a slew of new customers - close to 30 families!! So we beg you open in Roslyn 1st!! Thks for great time - we already referred more friends who rave about your spot already!!
I've been to many sushi bars/restaurants and many were good, however, this quaint little Raku I'ts Japanese restaurant is great for the money and freshness
I enjoyed the originality in their menu and the friendly atmosphere
The new menu is great, what a selection!!!
Close to Times Square, great atmosphere and an incredibly friendly staff
The sushi was very good, and very well prepared
Price was reasonable and completely in line with every other sushi restaurant I have visited
An extensive menu is available
The owner even came by several times to chat and make sure we were pleased with the food and our service
I will be back many times in the future
I dont see the hype around this place
What's up with that?! I once had their special of the day dessert
chocolate glazed over asian pear
hmm sounds good
but come on now, it was an asian pear - not dipped- not glazed, but chocolate syrup poured over a wedge of the pear

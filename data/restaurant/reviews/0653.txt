For dessert the Malakoff torte and the Linzer tart are my faves
My gf is partial to the salmon with spicy (jalapenos ?) spinach puree, and the salmon cake appetizer
Anything featuring salmon is likely to make her happy
I don't know how they managed to keep their prices at the same level for 6 or 7 years now, as far as I know there has never been a price hike since they opened
And I almost never miss the 5 buck goulash mondays, can't beat it for value and fun
Nice special drink menu, which changes daily, as well
The music can get a little loud, but the sidewalk eating is great people watching
We know almost everybody on staff by name, all very lovely individuals, and recognize many people from repeated visits
It is our Cheers indeed, but worth a trip from outside the hood as well, I would say
I've been wanting to give them a positive shout out for a while, here it is
Cafe Steinhof is a big disappointment
I've been there three times
On the first visit, a Saturday, the service was friendly and prompt, the food was delicious and plentiful, and the bill was cheap
On the second visit, a Sunday, the service was unfriendly and lethargic and the food was bland -- if plentiful
In particular, the waitress, a middle-aged malcontent, had to be hailed down to get a beer -- after waiting for five minutes -- and a request for additional bread took another five minutes
She never bothered once to ask how the food was
On the third visit, also a Sunday, I encountered the same waitress and waited the same five minutes to have my drink order taken, even though there were very few customers
The mussels -- what all the hipsters eat as they dine al fresco next to the heaps of garbage on 7th Avenue -- were tough, the sauce bland
Apart from the food, on the second and third visits, the beer was warm, the restaurant was noisy and the temperature inside must have been close to 90 F
What a shame! Bottom Line: Don't waste your money here
Instead, try the Thai restaurant next door
It's BYOB, the waitstaff is polite, the food is delicious and the price is right
The food here is excellent, the drinks are excellent, and the staff is incredibly nice
They show movies on Sunday nights and treat the customers like they are actually glad they came
Go there--the place is fantastic
We went to Steinhof about a week ago and sat at the bar since the place was packed, but they have the full menu at the bar
We had the grilled sausage platter with spatzel and a weiner-schnitzel and both were excellent
Great selection of beers, especailly their german draft beers
Just don't go if you are hard-of-hearing - the noise level can get incredibly high
But great food, nice bar and atmosphere, child-friendly
Bar staff very nice but wait staff snooty as all hell
Fab Schnitzl, Goulash, tomato soup, cucumber salad, Bratwurst and Kielbasa
If you want cheap food with your drinks, you can't beat this place
Outside seating in the summer but be warned, it's literally just wobbly cafe tables on the sidewalk
I was there a few times with adults only and a few times with quite a few kids
I was pleasantly surprised by how great the service was despite the kids running around, knocking down glasses, etc
The waited was very friendly, very patient, and recommended chicken paprika which meat literally was falling off the bone
It was so good that my 2 kids ended up eating like 3/4 of the portion while I had to nibble on the other 25%
The drinks are one of the best I ever tasted, especially the martinis
From a Park Sloper who has lived in Vienna, and his German roommates: this is the real deal, if you are looking for Austrian/German/Hungarian pub fare
The Wiener Schnitzel covers the whole plate, the Sauerbraten is tender and full of flavor, the salad platter way too big to finish, desserts excellent, all in all huge portions
extremely friendly staff, inventive drink menu, low prices, we are hooked
Steinhof is an Austrian insane asylum and nowhere is that better reflected than here
We were hassled about seating by our waiter who seemed at the end of his pony-tail, so we opted for the bar, quaintly decorated with giant fly strips
The specialty drinks were good, when we could wrestle our bartendress' attention away from conversation
As far as the food, some was spectacular, some was wretched
The tomato soup and the keilbasa were tasty
The Beef Gulash was lacking beef, but had plenty of gristle and fat
The Weiner Schnitzel was tough and came cold
Still, we tried desert, the Topfen Cheese Crepes are fantastic
Worth a twenty minute wait? No
But very good
Still, the worst part was there was no one to voice our complaints to
Hopefully there's a manager present on weekends
As I said, it wasn't packed
Food was good, waiteress was very helpful with all our questions
We moved to Park Slope a year ago, and Cafe Steinhof is hands down our favorite place for friendly atmosphere and very satisfying food
The saurbraten and chicken paprika with spatzel are superb, and all main courses come with a tasty salad
Love the chocolate custard and the malakof tort (reminds me of tiramisu)
Kid friendly, and generally always very accomodating and nice staff
Great beer selection, and the Sunday movie nights are fun
the only german is the name  food sucks music inside very loud, had to seat outside
Wiener Schnitzle looks and taste like pork chop from cheep bodega
Waiter needs a course on savoir vivre
Place looks nice inside but this is the only benefit
When we ordered pepsi , waiter gave us something that looked like pepsi but tasted like mixed leftovers of vanilla soda and ginger ale
when asked he said it's generic pepsi  Since I lived in Germany I know about German food DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS JOINT
Great food, ok service, crowed house
If you cannot get a table eat at the bar the bar service is great
This is a cool place to get drinks
My Schnitzel, with pork in lieu of veal, was pretty good
My gf's seafood ragout was less impressive
We had chocolate crepes and chocolate flan, both delicious
My only grievance is the $10 corking charge--a bit steep for a place like this
I would come back here, for a lighter meal--beer and a sausage
I have been going to Cafe Steinhof for about 3 years (since it opened) and I have found the food to be consistently deliciouos and the service always to be friendly and welcoming
The ambience and decorations are unique, interesting, comforting
I can't say enough about this place! The $5 goulash on Mondays is delicious, but really, I've never had a bad meal
It's my favorite place in NYC
My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice German place in Brooklyn and were pleased with this place
The food was good (I had the weiner schnitzel and spaetzle, my personal favorites) and it was really good
The portions were enough to completely fill me up and the price was about right
All in all, I highly recommend Cafe Steinhof to people who are looking for something other than takeout Chinese or pizza
Stopped in Cafe Steinhof randomly one night and was pleasantly surprised with the food! The cheese and meat plate is a great value
Potato pancakes and the kielbasa were enjoyable
Definitely a place I would good back to in the future!
Came here more than once, and have to admit that it's as close to Austrian/German as anything in Brooklyn ever gets
BUT, having actually lived in both countries I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this place offers an equivalent food substitute
The food ain't all that and the service was a bit slow
All in all it's a very laid back and reliable place
I lived in Germany for several years and must admit that Austrian and German cuisine was not my favorite
Cafe Steinhof reintroduced me to some old favorites and made me rethink Germanic fare
The Hungarian inspired dishes are especially good (Chicken Paprika, Goulash), the salads satisfying and the drinks are downright creative
Try the elderflower spritzer or the sour cherry martini
The service is very attentive, friendly and welcoming
I've enjoyed Cafe Steinhof more than any Biergarten, Gasthaus or Kneipe in Europe
You must try the chocolate custard -- Wunderbar!
A fantastic little neighborhood bar/restaurant
The ambience and attendive staff is really what keeps me going back
It truly has the feel of an Austrian cafe - very European and laid back, always great music playing

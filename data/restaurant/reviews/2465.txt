We showed up and they would not sit us until our entire party arrived, although the place was almost empty
We objected and they gave us a table that would not fit our party, but assumed they would accomodate when the rest arrived
When our party was all there, they told us we could squeeze in
Offended and irate we left and went to cafe lalo where although they were packed they tried their best to accomodate with class
I will never go back here
Since everyone else on here is praising the desserts, I'd like to put a word in for the salads, which I also found excellent (and gargantuan)
The coffee's quite good, too, and the decor's a blast
One of my favorite destinations in Manhattan for Saturday night coffee and dessert
Never a long wait for a table
Friendly, prompt service
Very scrumptous desserts
It's a treat
The Scene With three outposts around town, Sarabeth's Kitchen has become a well-known and reliable spot for casual dining at breakfast, lunch or dinner
This Amsterdam Avenue outlet has a citified rustic decor featuring small pastry cases, mullion windows, bentwood chairs and brass touches
The Food Lines form early on weekends for chive-scrambled eggs, pumpkin waffles lavished with sour cream, sticky buns, raisin scones and other quality baked goods
Lunch and dinner follow similar patterns--seasonal highlights include a robust autumn vegetable salad with apples, cheddar and celery root, and the cornmeal-crusted crab cake with julienne beets, sweet peppers and watercress
The dessert selection features simple winners like the candied pecan tarte and the spicy gingerbread ice cream
Ordered a seafood salad, tomato soup, and ice tea, it was great
Service was cordial
I nice quiet atmosphere to refresh and reflect
After YEARS of hearing about the amazing brunch at Sarabeth's, when I finally went for the first time on Mother's Day I was EXTREMELY disappointed
After waiting for an hour outside, when we finally got in, the place was very loud, and the food was pretty bad
The $15 eggs benedict was awful, the omelet needed some serious seasoning, and the potato waffles were rubbery and mushy
The only redeeming parts of the meal were the coffee and the croissant
I MUST point out however, the waitress was FANTASTIC
She was warm and friendly despite the enormous amount of work she was doing
The hostess was also excellent, and working brunch is a tough job
In one word: overrated
I've wanted to go here forever and finally pick Sarabeths for Easter brunch
We were a bit turned off when arriving the hostess at the door was completely rude to any person trying to put in their names, she was so rude that one girl said Im scared of her
After waiting over an hour, the food turned out to be less than desirable
I could have made a better farmers omelet and it only came with a small muffin
They charge you for home fries or other sides
The point is it wasn't worth it
Our brunch club agreed no one will go back
NOT recommended
cook at home or check out better spots
From the moment you enter and lay your eyes on the feast of cookies and beautifully jarred pudding, you know you're in for a treat
Many people already rave about the brunch (have the lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of chicken sausage) But their dinner is superb! The butternut squash ravioli is a hit and you can never fail with any one of their seafood specials
It is truly a welcome dining experience when you consider the long waits, arrogant staff and mediocre food at trendier places in the city
Sarabeth's west is a GEM
There's a reason why the wait is so long for this UWS cafe
Well, there's are actually two reasons: 1
They don't take reservations
2
Their breakfast/brunch menu is superb
I highly recommend the eggs benedict or the lemon and ricotta pancakes (they taste like a light version of homemade Italian cheesecake)
Just be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes for a table if you arrive after 10 am on a Saturday or Sunday
The omelettes are so great here and so are the muffins
Cute atmosphere, service is great and you aren't sitting on top of each other like in a lot of other places
I love coming here - now only if they took reservations
I went here on a sunny summer day, and received great service and food
My boyfriend and I went to eat after reading the rave reviews from citysearch to sarabeths, and we weren't disappointed
Everything was excellent
the orange jiuce
the omelette,potatoes, desserts etc
The waiter was very attentive
I will go again
soon
Went to this place for brunch the last day of my NYC vacation
They don't take reservations for anything but dinner,, so be prepared to wait a while
After about 20min we were seated by a quite snobby girl (yet i don't blame her
it seemed super stressy!!)
It was worth it
The athmosphere was a cosy and nice, yet somewhat loud, a few babies screaming their faces purple
Though the place was crowded we got our food very quickly
I had the french toast with strawberries and bananas which was DEVINE!! My company had buttermilk pancakes, omelette and home fries, these were also excelent, but we all thaught the french toast was the best
Milkshake and orangejuice was also good
I went to Sarabeth's for brunch this weekend, and it was by far the best brunch I have ever had
We did have to wait a half an hour to be seated, but it was well worth it
The service was excellent
The coffe
possibly the best coffee I've ever tasted
Everything was just delicious
(Get the breakfast chicken sausage
it comes in applesauce and is out of this world good
) It was a tad pricey for brunch, but I still plan on going back
and back again
and again
I've never posted a review of a restaurant before, but after this positive experience, I just had to
Their coffee is excellent
And the fluffy frech toast
I can't never get enough of it
To avoid weekend brunch-rush hour, GET THERE BEFORE 10AM!
The place puts out consistently bland but filling fare
There is nothing memorable about the cuisine
Nothing terribly exciting about the cuisine, the only thing memorable on the occasions visiting the restaurant are the prices
The few bright spots are the decent waitstaff and the desserts which are very well made
For good desserts one may as well hit some of the cafes downtown
Delicious food was served with patience and grace
Food is creative, perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, and delicious
Although we were there on a Saturday morning and it was very crowded, you never felt rushed
Our coffee cups were always full
We especially enjoyed the Popeye Eggs, French Toast, Farmer's Omelette, the Lemon Pancakes, and the Buttermilk Pancakes
The Blood Marys were excellent, too
Although Sarabeth's is known for its bustling weekend brunch (get there after 2:30 to avoid long lines--the kitchen is open till 4), it's also a calm, quiet, restful place for dinner
The tomato soup is famous--it's almost like a creamy spaghetti sauce
Have some wine, or a robust icy screwdriver (my favorite)
The prices are reasonable, and there's a list of light entrees for the less-than-famished
Altogether, hard to beat

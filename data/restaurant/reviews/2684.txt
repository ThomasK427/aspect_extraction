Only thing that could use a little imporvement is the simple interior design
A little out dated, but i guess that's what give it its charm
And that doesn't matter too much when everything else is so excellent! I have italian all over mahanttan and must say this place overall tops them all!
This place is awesome
The atmosphere could be a little better, I'm not a fan of drop ceiling tiles in upscale restaurants, but everything else is absolutely top notch
The servce was impeccable, as was the food
A bit expensive, but well worth it
the decor and ambiance is a bit formal and stuffy as the waiters are in formal attire and the crowd is older
this is a great place to bring your parents - not that that's a bad thing
the food and service is excellent overall
i had homemade istrian bowties with grappa sauce that was outstanding
they have a remarkably extensive wine list that you can see on their website
You can't go wrong
Everything is made to order and delicious
Service is wonderful and the food is even better
It's like being in Italy
ITS THE ONE OF THE BEST COLOMBIAN FOOD THAT I TRY,  I LOVE THE PINA COLADA THAT THEY PREPARE THERE  AND THE MEAL PRICES
VERY GOOD FOR YOUR POCKET THEY HAVE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR PARTY OF MORE THEM 20 PEOPLE AND A DIFERENT KINDS OF COCKTAILS
This Colombian restaurant is a nice place to go if your in the mood for a good, hot, Latin meal and you don't feel like leaving Astoria to get it
The restaurant is decorated with traditional Colombian hats, paintings and woven baskets hanging from the ceiling and blanketing the walls
It's not a romantic place to eat
It's not lit by candles and there's no dim lighting
They serve wine and beer, but they don't have a full bar
It's a small place that attracts mostly families and some couples
As far as the food, the grilled steak is tasty
It comes with rice, beans and a salad
That'll cost you about $9
95
Enjoy!
Fresca Tortillas is as their title states: Fresca
This free delivery establishment relies on freshly prepared Mexican food with very affordable prices
Don't go in there expecting the place is beautiful, it is your typical Queens delivery restaurant
The chili verdes are great, even the nachos are plentiful
Recommended for a relaxing night at home
This place is a mainstay of my diet - its cheap, healthy and delicious fast food mexican style
In Short Owned and operated by Thailand native Valee Arjariyawat, this joint serves fresh, tantalizing cuisine
From Tom Yum Gai ( a clear chicken soup with chili, lemongrass, mushrooms and lime juice) to Masaman Shrimp (sauteed shrimp with coconut milk, peanuts, avocado and masaman curry), the food is always cause for out-and-out rejoicing
Don't miss the picture of Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford hanging in a gold frame as you exit
Both look especially happy, probably because they too had a super-satisfying meal
This is a gem of a place
The food and service are really great and the prices are excellent
food not good too much
too much the place is ugly
not for a first date service was just ok
not even
I've eaten a lot of thai food in my day
This place has, by far the best Thai food in Astoria
The shrimp are always fresh and delicious (and well cleaned) and the flavors are wonderful and the food is never too greasy
The staff could be more attentive, but there is an ambiance here that is confusing, since there is an air of stuffiness among the staff, while the decor is tacky and spare
Try the steamed vegetable dumplings, which are obviously homemade - very delicate
The shrimp soup is perfect
This Thai restaurant may not serve the most authentic Thai cuisine, but their sophisticated use of spices is excellent in any dish
Chicken with coriander and duck dishes are excellent, but don't try their Tom Yum soups
And don't miss Pumpkin Castard for dessert
I recently moved out of Astoria, but when I lived there, Piazza Pizza was my go-to local pizza place
Typically huge New York-size slices with oozing cheese and zesty sauce
I only hope I can find something as good now that I'm in Brooklyn
Also, if you order a dinner, plan to have leftovers for the next day because the portions are HUGE, the salad that comes with a meal is large enough to be a meal itself
Well,  What can I say
I've eaten here at least a dozen times in the past few years and I have never been let down
Their skirt steak is great and their Strogonoff de Frango is excellent
The last time I was there I met the owner, Mike, a Brasilian who has lived in NYC for many years
He was a gentleman and really wanted to make sure we were having the most enjoyable meal possible
For what the service sometimes lacks in attention is really made up by the great food
This is a neighborhood location that should not be overshadowed by it's new glittery neighbors
If you want to have an authentic Brasilian dining experience at a relaxed, comfortable restaurant in Astoria, this is your best option
This is the only restaurant in New York I've repeatedly eaten in - 6 times, at last count
The skirt steak with onions gets me back me every time! If only they'd get a better wine list - the reds are all so mediocre - this would be the perfect meal
I love Sabor Tropical, and I'm Brazilian
I have some problems with their service sometimes, though, because even when the restaurant isn't very full, they're less than completely attentive
Also, buyer beware: when you ask for your check, it comes with an 18% suggested gratuity
And SOMETIMES, when you give your credit card to pay the bill, they'll put that in the total and leave the tip space open! It infuriates me because it's unethical, and when you point it out, they'll only offer to give it back in cash, not RE-SUBMIT the CC payment through the machine
This has, like I said, only happened a handful of times, but I find it abhorrent
However, it's some of the best Brazilian food I've had outside of Rio, so I keep going back
What can I say!
the steaks are the most amazing i have ever tasted
You have to wait a bit for your food, but its well worth it! make sure u come hungry, you will appreciate it more
I have been here 3 times already, all thre friends i bring here raveeeeeeeee about it
Great food, great service, great value, great location! and some evenings they have a live band playing! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
The food here is fantastic
The cooked dishes are wonderfully seasoned and the steak is out of this world
SOO much better than any of the well known Brazilian restaurants
Try: their caiprinhas, lemonade, Brazilian beer, any of the shrimp dishes like stroganoff or bobo, and definitely the steak picanha -- served on a hot griddle, sizzling thin perferct steaks with garlic
If you are a meat lover this is the place for you
I have been to many Brazilian Churrascarias (Green Field, Plataforma, others), but non like this one
The service is great, the food is fresh and one of the very best
The best part of all it's about 30% cheaper than their competition
They make one of the best caipirinas (drink) I have ever tasted
My favorite is the chicken with rice dish
I just love going there on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon
very family-oriented and the staff is so nice and efficient
great chicken
also the place is very clean and I love the red white decor
very inviting
Their hot spicy sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had
Peppermill Turkey, Sharp Cheddar, Canadian Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mayonnaise and Mustard on a french hero roll
They also have a phenomenal selection of beers
This place has amazing pizza and they always deliver quickly
We've also tried lots of their appetizers and salads and have no complaints yet after two years
Really, really recommend this place

The River Palm chain, currently at three locations, offers amazing steak, lobster, and other steakhouse fare at prices a lot more reasonable than its New York brethren
Always crowded, you need to wait at prime time, even with a reservation
But it's worth the wait
The family-style salad bowl (usually refillable) is marvelous
And the choice of potatoes/rice, etc
is included
Sides are excellent
Highly recommended
I was so thouroghly disapointed that I had to laugh
The wait staff were all poor Peter Luger wannabees and the food was horrible
A NY strip was as flavorless as a supermarket special can be
A a beautiful looking piece of Chilean Sea Bass was bland and flavorless
Cant even nring myself to try again
Been going to The River Palm for years and it easily matches and arguably exceeds any of the NYC steakhouses
The steaks are dead-on (their porterhouse is as good as it gets), service is flawless, the wine list is impressive, and the appetizers are sensational
They recently expanded the place to accommadate the crowds and I actually prefer the atmosphere there as compared to the Luger's and Wollensky's of the world
it's just nicer
It's minutes from the GWB and well, well worth it
I've eaten at many famous steakhouses
River Palm Terrace is not that well known relative to Luger's, but they're definitely one of the best in the North Jersey/Metro NY Area
River Palm will give a Luger-headache waiting for a table, but the steak will force a Chicago Chop House-smile on your face
The fare are on par with those in Manhattan, but if there's one place to go for US Prime Dry-Aged steak and a fairly-priced wine list it's RPT
Theres three of these places in my home, the Garden State
Do what I did: search the web for their website and a menu, go there and educate your taste
MMM excellent Food !!! I especially enjoyed their remarkable sweet Tomato salad
Wow, they were very Sweet Delicious, just like garden tomatoes
The waiter told us that they were called Ugly Tomatoes purchased from an Italian Store in Fairview, called Dante's
never had such wonderful tomatoes ever in my life
The Tilapia fish was also very tasty, accompanied by a glass of fine Italian wine
What a fine Italian restaurant !
Excellent food, portions service in a very comfortable friendly atmosphere
Very reasonable priced menu
There is something for everyone on their menu or daily specials
The choices are difficult
Why you might ask? Because it's all good!! Choices are plentyiful, from seafood to Steaks Chops
My Favorites are too numerous to list
I've been dinning at Roberto's for at many years I'd recommend this restaurant highly to all
I always look forward to our next delicious meal at Roberto's!
I enjoy the cave setting with the hidden art figures on the wall, very creative
However, this place lacks quality service, you can wait a very long time even after making a reservation
My friend had asked our waiter several times for her drink, but he kept forgetting or got side tracked
We were done eating our dessert and he finally brought over her soda
I enjoy this place the most during the cold season, for a nice cup of hot tea which is served in a small kettle, very cute
Archetypus is a great dessert place on Old River Road
The seating is in caves built into the walls, with decor of greek figures protruding from the walls
Dessert is absolutely fantastic, the most moist of cakes
They serve other food, but you should go for the dessert
Service is a bit slow and you may have to wait if you get there during peak hours (late night)
Also, they only accept cash
Got a hankering for a Nerthus (fruit and Ice cream married together for a heavenly taste)
Or maybe you prefer a Lahmajun (Armenian seasonings with veggies and beef and tzatziki to dip)
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is fun
A great place to bring some friends, or even for a quiet date
The food is amazing
You really cannot order anything bad! I would travel here from Manhattan to eat
Definitely get a reservation though - this place packs up fast! Also, BYOB
Rebecca's is tucked away on Old River Road
It's small and intimate and has extremely tasty, fresh seafood
Presentation is outstanding
They use a fair amount of tropical fruits such as mango and coconut, so it's not for everyone
A little expensive but not overly, especially given that you bring your own wine
If you can't make soup dumplings properly, don't add it to your menu and serve frozen ones marked up 4x that of the Chinese grocery store
Nothing beats Chinatown in the Manhattan or Flushing-Main st, but if you have a craving for really good Chinese, this is the best spot I have been able to find in the Edgewater Area
Easy parking and food comes out quick
Try the Pan Fried Noodles and the Steamed dumplings!
It's a very good price for nice quality Spanish cuisine
It's isn't the best, but it's definately a good place to go for a simple lunch/dinner
no frills Korean tofu jigae excellent BBQ ribs, highly recommended for a quick meal
it's good food and great value, but don't be surprised if you're asked to place your order before even getting a table, and presented with the check before you could ask for more tea
it's always super popular for dinner
so choose for your tufu jigae carefully: mild, not too spicy, hot, and extremely hot


Everyone defnatly needs to visit cafe boulevard
It is one of the best restaurant in new jersey
Went on date with my boyfriend and had great time
Sexy interior, best sangria we ever had anywhere, and fresh seafood
Had a great time
The live band and dj was very good too
awesome music here at this place
i have been for brunch dinner and after midnight and always they play really great music
very impressed
and i can actually hear it it is part of the ambiance not just background noise
great energy
this is the only place in new jersey that plays good music all the time
i hear little bits from brazil, middle east, paris, italy, new york
great party late too
amazing new european dance music that you can't hear unless if you go to ibiza or a few spots in paris tha i know of
highly recommended !!
The bar has a huge natural slate water fall that drips down behind the liquor bottles
Great lighting all over the restaurant
I usually go alone or on a date and sit at the bar
My favorite dishes are the Balsamic Steak Salad or Asian Seared Tuna Salad - both are amazing and consistent
The martinis are fantastic also
My cosmos and fresh watermellon martinis are always top notch
Friendly, cool staff
Great funky mixed crowd here too
No other place like this in jersey
This place is the best kept secret in NJ for sure
NJ has a bad rep and rightfully so - the restauants, bars, stores, etc are generally lame

gnocchi melting in your mouth, discrete service, attention to details, seductive ambience, mesmerizing wine list, original decor, try it before you die
very cool, accomomdating staff sat a party of 10 of us on a busy friday night
the staff was very friendly, very italian, very knowledgable of every aspect of the menu specials, the setting was great, tight (but aren't they all) but a great vibrant atmosphere
food was a little slow in getting to us, as were the drink service which was my only knock on the place, but once it arrived it was very very good italian some great fresh seafood
plus it's in a great part of the west village from which to go out afterwards
I've been here several times, and always really enjoyed it
Proper Sardinian food, really flavorsome and rich
Good for treats
Only takes reservations for 4+ people
Since the opening I went there a lot of times but lately I found that the atmosphere I loved dissappeared, replaced by an annoying hostess asking money to check our coats, a barking owner and a manager more interested in tasting wines and chasing tails than attending customers
Food was still good but the experience has been a bit disappointing
I live nearby and this is such an advance over what was there -- stuffy old EQ
Adventurous menu and not insanely expensive
Only downside was service one night, but think that was because it was so crowded
Our waitress was really nice, but overwhelmed
The place has a sexy vibe
Actually, I was there the night they opened -- After a show at the old Westbeth while walking home with visiting friends, we were welcomed inside and treated like family for free drinks
free snacks and free cake
And that night, we weren't even dressed half way decently
Wow!  Must add that they have a hutch that serves paninni (sp?) and coffee during the day
I just had a freshly made iced Cap that was SUBLIME!
Went here for Valentine's Day
The place is very quaint, and dimly lit
The staff was very friendly and curteous
The host was actually walking around handing all the women flowers
Food was great, and it was very inexpensive for what we got
Definitely reccommend it as a great place
Romantic setting, affordable prices, ideal location in the Village
Osteria just opened over the summer and I've already taken out-of-town guests there a dozen times
Everything on the menu is excellent
Be sure to get there early because they do not accept reservations for small parties
Also, as the dining room fills it can get a bit noisy
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table
However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling
Then we saw another
and another
and the place was really overrun with them
I've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place (except in a really bad dream)
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected
As much as I like the food there, I can't bring myself to go back
I've been to Ottimo four times now, and can't wait to go again
The food is great, especially the fresh pasta, and the service is excellent
Try the grilled eggplant salad it's a very good
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
The food is authentic Italian - delicious! Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable
This is an amazing place nestled in between the Flatiron District and Chelsea
I've been looking a long time for great Italian food at not too expensive prices, and found it, the Veal Chop is OUT OF THIS WORLD
the ambience is Old World Italian and the Chef and wife, who also owns the restaurant are friendly and personable
it's an amazing find and you will not be disappointed!
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca)
Was surprisingly disappointed
Pizza was a little soggy
Ravioli was good
but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced
Not enough wines by the glass either
Service, however, was excellent
and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot
Food was just average
if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw
This place is wonderful
Excellent servers who are really Italian
and the homemade pasta is worth every penny!!! I haven't had ravioli that good since I was in Italy
It's rare that I go to a new restaurant and want to come back the next day
The people at Ottimo made it their business to know who I was; considering that English is a second language at this restaurant, that was no easy task
They might not have remembered my name after the first visit, but they remembered my face
And by the third visit I felt like part of the family
The genuine atmosphere is a comfortable one
Great food, warm surroundings and charm all around
The food from the appetizers to the desserts, will make your mouth water as it is set down on the table and will make you moan after each bite
Why wouldn't you come back week after week?
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito's home
When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit
His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious
Great wine list, reasonably priced

The $9
99 Prix Fixe Lunch Specials are the best I have found in this price range and the food is superb
I often dine here with my friend and we spend 3 hours hanging out over a liesurely meal
You are provided with a lovely marinated zuccini appeitizer with bread and the owner/chef is more than willing to cook anything not on the regular menu
There is a good selection of very reasonably priced wines
This restaurant is never crowded and I don't understand why as it truly is a great restaurand find in Murray Hill
There is also an equally pleasing $19
99 Prix Fixe Dinner menu
My wife and I dined at Dolcino several times since moving to moving to Murray Hill early last year
The food is always fantastic
Compared to the other italian resturants in the area and on 3rd ave (we've tried them all) Dolcino is simply the best both in terms of quality, and value
The owners here take obvious pride in the food they serve and the service is also great
Our only regret is not going there more because of all the choices in NYC but ineveitably when trying other Italians in New York we always use Dolcino as our measuring stick, and the others usually fall way short!
My wife and I had our engagement party here, and have eaten more than 20 meals at this lovely mid-town east-side italian restaurant
Ray, the owner/master chef prepares the meals, cooked to order, and greets most of the guests upon arrival
I highly recommend the Ministrone soup; the field greens or ceasar salad, the grilled portabello mushroom, the baked clams
For an entree try one of the specials or have the chicken franchese, the veal parmigana or the fine home made pastas
My boyfriend and I stumbled across this restaurant as we were looking for something to eat before catching a movie at the nearby Loew's theater
What a wonderful surprise it was! The ambience was just great, resembling the old European style with dark wooden walls and candlelight
The service was very attentive and polite

Just wonderful
I have come across this restaurant by accident
I'm a financial analyst, so work and live downtown
Going to the theater, we saw Trattoria Dopo Teatro and tried it
They squeesed us in with no reserations, and I'm so glad they did
What a delightful meal
I had the ossobuco - it was magnificent
My friend raved about her wide pasta tossed with chunks of wild boar
I was stunned to find such quality, so moderately priced and so close to the theater
We were so impressed, we stopped by for dessert after the show, that's when we met the chef and the friendly manager
It turns out the Chef, Roberto, was formally a chef at Osteria del Circo and Da Silvano
The prices here won't break your budget though
What a find
I'm surprized I haven't heard of them sooner, but I'm passing on the good news : )
I love the theater, so I go to the pre-theater dinner a lot
This is my favorite pre-theater and it's really close to almost all the theaters
They make their own pastas and desserts, so try
The pizzas are really good
I'm a meat lover, so I will recommend the veal, out of this world, and the steak - love it
Most importantly, they understand the pre theater crowd
The service is quick and friendly
They'll seat you promptly and get you out in time for the show
A glass of wine won't hurt
I love their wine selection
I'm from Texas, I moved to New York recently, this restaurant was recommended to me by a friend
I had a lovely time for pre-theater dinner
The service was quick and friendly
The food was excellent
I had the ossobuco that was spectacular
The restaurant was busy, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night before the theater
I read some reviews and I agree with most of them, however, the reviewer suggesting that tourists don't know about restaurant I find appauling
I've travelled a lot and I feel that gives me a better perspective on dining than some New Yorker that never left the city
Sorry, that comment just hit a nerve
The restaurant is lovely with amazing authentic Italian food
I'm surprized to find the bad review from the same weekend I was there, I'm assuming the previous reviewer was there recently
I was there on Sat and had a fantastic time
We had a pre-theater dinner, it was 7 of us
We had a table downstrais, very nice
We were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival
One of my daughters had spagetti and liked it very much
I shared pizza with my sister and we absolutelly loved it
The pizza is amazing
I'm a New Yorker and that is good pizza! I have to say, I didn't like the comment about tourists, who don't know any better
Well, as a New Yorker, I know pizza and love this one!
I just have to say, they did a great job
I surprized my wife with a dinner and Broadway show for Valentine's Day on Sat
I made arrangements with the manager beforehand and they delivered
I pre-ordered a bottle of wine to the table and sent flowers to the restaurant to be put on the table for her, when we arrived
It was perfect
We had a table downstrais in the garden, on a little balcony, very romantic
The wine and the flowers were waiting for us
The food was delicious, I had a steak - great
My wife had a lobster ravioli, she raved about
We were out in time for the play, a perfect evenning
My buddy recommended the place, we definately will be back!!!
I had to organize, on the fly, a dinner pre-theater on a Sat, before Valetine's Day for 12 women! Hey, good luck to me, huh
Well, I called my friend in a panic and she recommended this place
They were wonderful
I called ahead to make our reservation, I spoke to the menager, who assured me we would be seated at one table
This was a dinner for a fundraiser commitee, so it was important
Everything was perfect
We had a beautiful table downstrais
We were seated promptly
Our waiter was wonderful, very attentive
The food was amazing
A few of us had a wild boar pappardella, which was absolutelly delicious
The veal was excellent I heard from the ladies
The wine was very good and they had us out in time for the show
Wonderful, I can't thank them enough
Mario, the manager - a life saver
Thank you
After much research, we decided on this for our pre-theater dinner
We made reservations but arrived and had to wait 10 minutes moving out of people's way constantly before we were seated in what the hostess described as a beautiful table Our table was cramped in the downstairs area back corner literally less than 2 ft
from 4 other tables (they really pack em' in) The service was rushed and unfriendly, the food average (bread awful) and the portions small
You literally had to grab the waiter on the way by to ask anything and everyone around was frustrated
We got there at 6:10 and barely made it to our show
It was truly UNROMANTIC
I'm telling you
don't do it
We picked this place for a family brunch because some had a matinee to attend
After seeing all the positive reviews, I'm not sure if it's because they are from tourists who don't know any better, or if we just went on a bad day
Many of us ordered the pizza, and it was nothing like wood-fired oven pizza should be - crust was white and floppy, instead of crispy and flaky, and too much cheese
A few ordered the lobster salad, and the lobster was almost frozen
One person had a glass of pinot grigio, apparently from a bad bottle - yet the waiter didn't seem to understand this
He eventually got her a new glass of a different wine, but not without some confusion
2 people ordered a salad before their pizza, and had to wait a very long time in between
Desserts were decent, nothing spectacular
If you're going to the theater and need a great place, this is it
I took my 3 daughters, my parents and my wife to the theater last week and we had dinner here
Everything was delicious
The pizza is so great the kids will be satisfied
I had really good stracci, wide pasta, with panceettta, beans in a white wine sauce
My wife loved her gnocchi with lobster
My father raved about the steak
My mom had the chicken with mushrooms
Everybody was happy
They gave us a big table downstrais
We were seated promptly
Our waiter was very attentive and polite
I highly recommend it

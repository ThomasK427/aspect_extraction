It was so cute/sweet considering this is a fancy restaurant
The whole dinning experience was just fantastic
Beautiful setting, with elaborate and attentive service - at times
Very expensive, some arrogance in getting reservations
This place caters to some long-term 'important' customers, the other guests are simply accepted
Too expensive for medium quality food
I'm very reluctant about recommending this place, for fear that fad mongers will ruin it
I met up with my cousin and aunt for dinner and was completely enamoured with the quiet, warm, cozy, and very French charm of this restaurant and the husband/wife team that owns it
Here, you dine with special loved ones who won't embarrass you and vice versa
As for food, the proportions are small but the quality is excellent
I ordered escargots for appetizers and savored every bite
Service was outstanding -- if you want rushed service, go elsewhere
There's nothing pretentious about this place, but do not go here if you want to be seen or if you're a donkey around people
We were treated as guests, not just diners, at this homey establishment
However, prepare to pay beaucoup d'argent in the end
The food and the ambiance do not come cheap, whatsoever
An itsy-bitsy restaurant - husband and wife-fun with a limited, but delicious menu
A great place to take someone special for a cozy dinner
The steaks are delicious and the restaurant is authentic French
Delicious food with friendly service at a fair price
I definitely plan on going again
They have a very quaint backyard where you can have a romantic meal with your loved one or a cosy meal with your friends
Recently reopened, Caffe Buon Gusto is my favorite restaurant, whether I want an intimate dinner with someone special or if I'm getting together with friends
You'll forget all your troubles when your food arrives- I recommend their gnocci with alfredo or vodka sauce, although I admit, everyone I've ever brought with me to Buon Gusto has given their dish rave reviews
This place is the next best thing to my grandmother's Italian cuisine
and I don't bestow that honor to any other restaurant
Affordable prices, wonderful service and a quaint ambiance will make this your favorite too!
My fiance' and I has such a wonderful time here
This place has the potential to be an absolute goldmine
The service was great, the food was absoluteky amazing and the ambience is very warm as well
I definitely reccomend people to eat here
The price is right and you wont regret it
We will definitely be back very soon
Bonus also is, they have takeout or delivery!! Enjoy like we did!
This could be a pleasantly elegant restaurant
The atmosphere is nice, with low candle lighting, but the acoustics are not good
Even with only a few people in the restaurant, it's extremely noisy
The music playing makes the noise level even worse
My dinner companion and I had to scream at each other to have a conversation
However, the food is quite nice
I recommend the gnocchi with pescelli e funghi sauce or the sole in lemon butter
If you really want to enjoy this food, head up to their location on E
77th St
The Scene Traditionally the lair of well-heeled burghers from the East Side, Le Perigord has been splendidly rejuvenated, both in setting and cuisine
Gone are the dull hotel-like colors and unflattering lighting--peach is the new leitmotif
Soft leafy sconces, splays of flowers and well-spaced tables add to the comfort level
No, you won't see Leonardo diCaprio here, nonetheless the dining room has a palpable vitality that is now attracting couples who don't remember the Eisenhower administration
Service here remains among the best in the city, and the most welcoming
The Food Jacques Qualin, formerly of Jean-Georges, has tossed the rich quenelles into the river in favor of splendid dishes like terrine of salmon and spinach tinged with coconut; roasted veal chop aromatic of anise and hyssop (a mint-like plant) and tender venison with pickled beets and huckleberries
Desserts are simple and traditional, but terrific--and if chocolate makes your blood run hot, the molten cake here is a case of hypertension
My wife ordered the Warm Foie Gras and the Roasted Lobster, I did the Escargots and the Roasted Duck
my Goodness, the Duck!!! If it wasn't for the dessert, a Grand Marnier Soufle that was coming, I could've eaten the whole of the Duck, so I just ate half of it
Really exceptional, serious, authentic french
We loved the food and the 86 Petrus for $800, a good value, never seen it less than $1200
Very charming and attentious staff, too
My wife and I were recently in NYC for a four day Broadway experience
We had been to Le Perigord a few years ago and it was wonderful so the restaurant was to be our highlight
Well of the 5 evening meals that we had
this was truely the bottom!  The waiters were continually running to get things done
and still no service
The meal was improperly served
Wellington was over cooked
dessert never came because after 2
5 hours we ran out of time
I would never recommend this restaruant
I sent them an e-mail after returning home and they did not have the courtesy to respond
went there for restaurant week
the service was really really great
we were promptly seated and the waitsaff was very courteous
The food wasn't too impressive but above average
Overall, I will go back and try again maybe, their non-RW menu will be more exceptional
very bad experience
Bad food, and bad menu for restaurant week
It was like giving the worst dishes
We will not come back and we definetely do not recommend it
the worst restaurant,  food was way too salty,  uncomfortable, nightmare!!!
A very good traditional french restaurant that tries to be conservative rather than to be with the in crowd
I love this restaurant for the reason of it keeping up with tradition
Oh, did I mention that the owner has a good sense of humor too? I think this is the best bang for the buck in terms of french cuisine
Where else can you go in New York that is comfortable, you get spectacular traditional French Haute Cuisine, you are treated like a king without pretense, and you pay $62 from soup to nuts
My favorite NY restaurant
Don't expect to see any tatoos and piercings here though
The crowd is mature
We had a wonderful dinner here on February 21, 2004
The ambiance and staff are very welcoming and set the stage for a great evening
We enjoyed oysters and a fabulous artichoke soup
The entrees of filet mignon and duck breast were beautifully prepared and served
George, the owner, really makes you feel welcome here
The whole dining experience is first class and very refined
We can't wait to return
I ate at Le Perigord last week and was blown away
The host, Georges, did not only have a larger-than-life personality, but he attended to my every wish
If anyone is put off by his attentiveness, they need to get a life
The food was some of the best French food I have had in years
I recommend the roast duck and the vegetable tart, both menu staples for years, according to my new friend Georges
Wine selection was impressive, too
The food was exceptional here and the staff was very attentive, however the room was so dull that I thought I was going to fall asleep while I was there
If you want to eat real Japanese food, this is it
Don't need to go other Japanese place unless you want to enjoy the decor, atomosphare
Any food is wonderful

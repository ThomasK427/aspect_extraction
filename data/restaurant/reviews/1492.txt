Right then and there, I should have known this was a prelude of what's to come
As we waited patiently, the staff assembled our tables
The space that was provided was extremely inadequate
In fact, my friend had to stand up every time staff members needed to pass by in order to perform their duties
Staff - Friendly, but they need to brush up on their serving skills
For instance, they only poured water for half the table
In addition, they failed to remove wine glasses from the table from those individuals who were not drinking
Decor - Small and hot (no air condition)  Food - Where do I begin? What does it say about an establishment and its chef when its policy forces the Price Fixed, Chefs Choice Menu on every party six or greater? It is clearly a warning sign, STAY AWAY
The chef's choice of food combination was poor and uninspiring
The portions were tiny, fit for a boy of 5 years old
Lets just say, the one raw scallop we each received was the biggest item of all the entre dishes throughout the night
The waiting time per dish was approximately 20 minutes, which is hysterical since the restaurant was half empty and practically every dish was served raw to some degree
Price Definitely overpriced
Your money would be better spent elsewhere
Overall, it is quite obvious I would never recommend Knife Fork to anyone
Furthermore, I would question every positive review this restaurant has received
Unfortunately, my friends and I had to learn the hard way
You dont
Space was not particularly impressive but the staff is friendly and the menu selection, while small, does have several good choices
I ordered the foie gras appetizer and the Chilean sea bass and both were very good and had unique tastes, but extremely small portions (set on large plates)
Even after an appetizer, entree and dessert (strawberries balsamic), I still left hungry
And at $75 for my dinner, I thought it was a bit of a stretch
Some updated decor could really add to the appeal of this place
The restaurant Euzkadi located next door is a little more of a good time in my opinion
While trying to dine at the knife and fork, I could hear the chef cursing at and insulting the wait staff
It was very upsetting and ruined my appetite while trying to eat my food
The staff were very curtious and kind but it was obious they were stressed
The wait for the order to arrive was much too long and the food was not worth the wait
I would only reccomend going there if you want an experiment in observing a high-minded restaurant with a toxic atmosphere
A friend of mine chanced upon this place while strolling the East Village
The ambiance looked charming and cozy
Especially loved the finish of the bar, very rustic feel to it
Since it was our first time, we opted for the tasting menu
A real bargain for what it includes ($45!!)
Everything from the consomme to the ricotta was cooked to perfection
The marriage of flavors and spices, one would not imagine mixing well together, were excellent combinations
My pallette was no doubt entertained and left me wanting for more
K and F is a great culinary experience
I have been back twice since and the food is consistently top notch
Hurry and make your reservations, I think word has gotten around how good this place is that it's getting harder and harder to get a table
What a charming, laid back at the same time romantic feel at home kind of place with impeccable food presentation and incredible adventurous combination of flavors
from the appetizers to the deserts
and lets not forget the excellent wine list !!!!  In all for a great bargain! I had the pleasure of tasting the scallops and the dusted skate cooked to perfection
which is rare in NYC !
My mother who came to visit me from France was also impressed by the harmonious blend of each ingredient
She started with the carppacio of peppered beef followed by the Lavender rubbed duck breast
and finished with the thyme Panacotta
The chef is a Magicien ! The intimate atmostphere and service add to this little gem
Hurry before the word spreads
it is already too late
Mum mentioned to go again before her departure
I heard this restaurant through a friend of mine and decided to go since my mom just arrived from France
French citizens, we both enjoy good restaurants
We both impressed by the quality of each courses from the appetizers to the deserts
What surprised us the most was the unusual combination of flavors in each dish
i just joined citysearch to write this review, because this was the worst dinner i've eaten in my life
the menu looked great, it's a cozy space, and our bottle of rioja was nice, but that's where it ended
each dish got worse and worse until it became a joke at our table
the foie gras appetizer had no taste, the entrees were served on enormous white dishes with no sides, despite the fact the menu described the dishes with side items
the duck breast was charred and tasted like it had been marinating in Robitussin for weeks, the chicken was undercooked and just plain sucked - essentially, it's an ambitious menu that sounds delicious, but the combinations actually don't work at all or are completely tasteless; every dish could have been sent back, and finally the duck was - the chef offered a free dessert, which we took b/c we had wine to finish
expresso machines weren't working, the bathroom door didn't shut all the way or lock, and dishes were smashed twice in the kitchen throughout the night
i feel bad, the service was attentive and its a nice space, but it really was an absolutely horrible meal
looking around the room, it also seemed the people were politely just trying to finish and get out of there
don't go if you're hungry
it took 90 minutes for us to receive our dinner
the food was overpriced and undercooked
and to top it off, the chef refused to cook the food more thoroughly when we requested he do so
We went rather spontaneously on a Friday night and found a charming, wonderfully-athmosphered room with a long table that had been set for a group and a handful other patrons scattered within
giving us an immediate feel of intimacy and being welcome
Our hostess explained the dishes, recommended the tasting menu which already seemed like a bargain at under fifty dollars
We were served an exceptional Consomm made w Tomato and Green Tea, a seascallop w pickles, a cured salmon with dill, the adventurous duck-tongue and octopus salad (which was deliciously refined), a curried skate (my personal favorite) and a lavender rubbed duck breast, which was too fatty for us, but therefore only presented a bit of more labor by cutting it
desert consisted of a Thyma Panacotta
which left me begging for more (still is)
All in all a harmonious dining experience, which makes me dream about it 'til next time
My friend and I dined last night at this quiet, neighborhood jewel
Everything was impeccable, from the wine list to the presentation, the glasses, the service
But not stuffy at all
There was a laid-back East Village charm from its service but strict attention to detail and presentation, flavors in unique harmony
Excellent value
The chef is adventurous with his mix of ingredients that you can't really pigeon-hole his cuisine
No need to stab in the dark with the menu, each dish is sure to be perfection
We had the duck and the lamb; both were excellent
Go before the stampede!
If you want top quality food prepared with imagination and presented with a personal touch then this hidden gem is the place for you
Whether you are going on your first date, celebrating a special occasion or entertaing a group of friends or hosting a work function this venue can cater to all sizes
The wine bar offers top quality wines at reasonable prices along with a meal with flavors from around the world
It is certainly NYC best kept secret
New to the scene but not for long once the word gets out
A must try if your visiting new york or if your looking for a new fab local haunt
SPREAD THE WORD
Its obvious that Chef Damien Brassel strives for perfection
Although you may not believe that the one man kitchen can turn out such utter delights of aroma, taste and presentation
Each plate is thoughtfully constructed, each ingredient not missing an ounce of attention
His combination of flavors and tasty emulsions are of things you wouldnt think to be: House cured salmon with cauliflower puree; Curry rubbed skate with lobster reduction; Lavender rubbed duck with red onion marmalade and parsnip puree
Words cant properly describe the menu or the level of quality and layering of flavors of the skillfully crafted dishes
The five course tasting meal is an unbelievable price for food at this level
Wine list is reasonable
Dcor is rustic and pleasant
Damien and his wife Kristi (who is also the hostess) are very charming and engaging
Before we realized, 5 hours had passed! Go now before the crowds

It is a roudy, crazy restraurant that you can't go with only a few friends
Bring everyone and keep drinking- It's the best way to enjoy it
You get a 5 course meal and all the cheep wine you can drink- so drink up, relax and have fun
You can't be uptight or a stickler for manners and courtesy
It's just simply a great, fun, hilarious place to go with tons of friends to yell and laugh and have a good time
The food was great, and it's different everytime ya go!  It's no typical dining experience, so if you're ready to go with the flow and enjoy yourself try them out
not bad food, but an increadible rip off
The waiters are total jerks and the owner is worse
don't go here
Service was bad, decor was bad, food was worse, price was way too much
Cheap table wine better used for nail polish
Fresh mozzarella looked like plastic
Pasta dishes nothing to write home about
Meat dish served last so you filled up on the appetizers
Forget about this place
This is what Little Italy should be -- great food, shady digs, house wine, and friendly to parties
Hint: bring a big group and offer to pay with cash to haggle for a discount
Took them forever to clean the table and get me the check!
Must agree with other reviewers
Been here a few times
I was drawn to the fact that it seemed like a quiet, out of the way place my boyfriend and I could make a sentimental favorite
Unfortunately, no
Regardless of the amount of customers, the wait for food is insanely long
Once we were THE only table in the place and waited TWENTY FIVE minutes
Servers are disinterested, bra-less girls
Food is alright, but *way* too expensive for the portions and for the quality of the service/atmosphere
It's like paying forty bucks for a mediocre meal in a run-down place
and you might starve to death before it gets to you
Tried really hard to like this place, but it's hard to ignore all the low points
Don't bother with this place
It has bad service and overpriced/mediocre food
It took 15 minutes before anyone took our order and that's after I had to flag a busboy down to get our waiter/waitress
There were only 8 customers in the whole place
If the waiter/waitresses weren't too busy BSing with each other, there wouldn't be us unhappy customers
Another customer left yelling how bad the service and food was as well
It's no wonder they have their host standing outside on the street trying to get customers in
Who goes to Cha Cha's for dinner or even a pizza? You go for the homemade gelato
the chocolate cake
a cannoli
BUT the place is starting to look unkeep, dirty
and the help is helpless
Five years ago you entered Cha Cha's and you felt like you were in Little Italy, now the waitress has a russian accent and it doesn't seem special anymore
Crappy Service
But worth it
The hot and sour soup here is great- Both the regular and the vegetarian versions
The woman who takes the order over the phone is probably the most unpleasant person I have ever spoken too but I continue to get their takeout because it is just that good
I just suck up and treat her like my own personal Soup Nazi
My boyfriend and I always stop by for the steamed veggie dumplings and scallion beef pancakes--just these 2 dishes are worth the trip =) The food is great and the atmosphere is clean and comfy
not sure why those other raters didn't like this place, but i've been there a few times and never have had any complaints
the dumplings are really good, and the sesame shrimp is awesome
shrimp in lobster sauce is good too
ambiance has always been nice when i was there
the worst thing for me is trying to find the place everytime
I came here last week with an office luncheon, and I thought the dumplings were pretty good
(The service wasn't great, but that's to be expected with a party of 35 in a small restaurant)
I came back today, and I was really disappointed
The dumplings were still good, but they never brought the rest of my meal
We were the first people in there, and they brought meals to other parties, as well as the rest of my party's, and left me waiting ten more minutes
They forgot the spring roll, which came with the power lunch I ordered
Three people came to ask if everything was ok, and when we told them no, they just shrugged and said sorry
I eat lunch in Chinatown at least once a week, and I know there is a language barrier, but this treatment was unacceptable
Go to New Green Bo instead
Based upon reviews on this site, I took a group of folks to this restaurant and I was horrified by the terrible food
We tried 3 dumpling dishes and found the fillings to be tasteless and the noodle coverings to be thick, pasty and undercooked
The 4 entrees were equally tasteless
I don't understand where this 10 rating came from
My friends and I have always gone back to Lin's because their dumplings fill us up and satisfy our palates and all for under $10 a person! We order all kinds of dumplings and even though we sample only 1 or 2 of each, by the end of the list of dumplings we are all full to the brim
The three flavor steamed and pork and leak boiled are our favorites
The veggie dumplings are also great!!! The only thing I can't say anything about is the rest of their food because we've only ordered the dumplings! They are that good
Oh, and there was never a wait!
I love this place
I bring my non-vegetarian meat eating friends and they love it as well
The food is very good, so is the atmosphere
The dim Sum menu provides for many tasty pickings that usually serve as a substitute for the main course
Just make sure you pre-order Treasure Boxes if you go
Prices more like home, not NYC! Stopped in for a quick breakfast on a quiet Sunday morning
Attentive waitstaff
Food was made quickly
This gem of a find in Vietnamese food may not be a jewel box in decor but a real diamond in the rough for the gastronomic delights it offers
The interior is basic and sparse of the trappings of other so called gimmicky restaurants since the food is the real draw here
My faves are the stuffed calamari, Boluclac (marinated grilled beef over rice) and the Spring Rolls
The pho' noodle soups are also fantastic with the broth itself not needing much of seasoning
Best of all, the prices makes you feel like you can splurge for less than $20
This is a perfect small spot to go for dim sum
If you want an experience a little less large and intense than Jing Fong than look no further than Mandarin Court Restaraunt
I found this to be a superior experience
The decor is a minimalist cool grey, white and green with sleek understated sculptures set in lit recesses in the walls
The staff is courteous greeting customers with a hello; promtly seating them with a teapot and dim sum ticket placed on the table
There's no muscak in the background which is nice and it's much more quiet than the larger Dim Sum Parlours
The food is exemplary in both quality and selection
I went on a weekday and there was a cart with nothing but made to order dishes
I chose the salt crusted shrimp from this cart
In just 5 minutes I had hot shrimp as fresh as ones I've eaten from Mississppi Gulf catch
Delicious and filling
I was also pleasently surprised to find that they had shark fin dumplings which you don't find everywhere and they also had several tofu dishes
The dessert cart included almond dofu, fruit and almond dofu, red bean sesame and lotus sesame pastriesl to name a few
The a la carte lunch menu was very inexpensive as well there were only 5 items over $7
00
I went in this restaurant with troubles on my mind and left feeling like my load was lightened
This is a good place to take children as well because it is small and the floors are tile instead of carpet so if something spills it's no big mess

The servers know their way around the menu like a good New Yorker knows their way around the Barney's sale
Gotta love the new DJ spinnin beats and knockin' out the 80s music here and there
It got everybody in the mood last time I was there
Hot place for a date and good to take the fam, or dine alone
The staff is awesome and make you wanna cozy up to them after they feed you right
Wonderful atmosphere and music meet you immediately when you walk through the front door
It is fun and exciting
Alot of people in the bar drinking colorful martinis
The tuna tartare is out of this world - follow that with the salmon and your in heaven
The dessert list is so good but the E-wich (a huge ice cream sandwich) is pheonominal
Wow, I almost had to be carried out with all of the good food and drink I had
What made it all work was the relaxed and efficient service staff who are quite nice to look at
No children are found here which is a huge plus
Can't wait untill the weather improves and the open up outdoor dining!
Eatery Restaurant in Hell's Kitchen - My first visit there a couple if nights ago proved that there are gems to be found in Manhattan
Eatery is an outstanding restaurant because the food is sophisticated enough to warrant a hefty price tag but incredibly inexpensive
I say sophisticated because of the many different flacors working together in one dish
The tuna entree was Fab! My friend ordered the meatloaf - YUMMY! and with cocktails, I have to say, the bill was a pleasant surprise
My only regret is that I live outside their delivery zone
That's ok, because Eatery Restaurant has made visiting Hell's Kitchen more rewarding than it's ever been!
I've been to Eatery twice in the past couple of weeks because I just love the food and my friends and I have such a great time when we go
The casual ambience, the friendly staff, delicious martini's - I could go on for ever
Part of the reason for our frequent visits is the value
There aren't many places where a doggie bag is almost a necessity considering lunch is priced below $10
The selections for lunch are huge
I recommend the Mac Jack - mmmmm! If thats too much they have really great entree size salads
My friends returned for brunch last week and told me about the pork tostada
I see brunch at Eatery in my very near future!
I went to see a show the other night and my cousin recommended Eatery Restaurant before the theatre
Everything was wonderful
The staff was so nice and the food was delicious
I also dined with the most pickiest person I know and she loved it
My friend is a vegetarian and so our waiter recommended the Farmer's Market Pasta that changes daily
It was fresh and delicious
Even though I'm not a vegetarian, for my friend, I ordered the Wok Charred Vegetable Salad with Tofu and that was delicious as well
My friend liked that too
So not only have I found a great restaurant for me, I finally, found one that I can eat at with my picky friend!
I've now been to Eatery several times and every time I just love it
It's always pulsing with great music and a great crowd
I always listen to the waiters' recommendations, because they're always awesome - either a special or just one of their faves off the menu
Hell's Kitchen is such a great central location to meet friends, and Eatery is the best place that offers something for everyone, especially if you like a fantastic Cranapple Martini!!!
What a great spot I found to go before the theater
Never again will I try one of those touristy Times square places which are too loud and too crazy
I got seated very quickly and had a cocktail even before I knew what I wanted to order
I had a great crabcake app and my salad was fresh and tasty! Go there and you wont be dissapointed!
Went to a cool midtown spot for a bite and a drink
I'll definately go back
I was greeted by a gracious and welcoming host, led to my table by a gorgeous red head, my waiter was surprisingly unjaded, and as my girlfriend put it, easy on the eyes
A DJ played a cool mix, and the place was full
If you hate great food and fantastic martinis this is not your spot
Lucky midtown they deliver
Could you consider a Queens location?
I had a great time at Eatery
I ordered a few drinks, an app, and then dinner
Everything tasted fantastic and the server was extremely helpful when it came time for me to order
I ordered one of their specials and was glad I did
The food was very satisfying and went very well with the wine the server chose for me
I'll be back!
Eatery is my spot in the hood
I love my neighborhood and love that eatery is a part of that! Every time Im there its like an event
Always entertaining from the great wait staff to the Mac and Jack
What a nice mix of cool people, gay and straight
You will not be disappointed
I'm from out of town
Thank you Eatery for making my New York Experience so great
We had such a great time
The place was packed
So much going on, it was awesome
A DJ was playing a really good mix
Waited at the bar for our table, had a canapple martini, wow it was delicious
Server was nice and very prompt
Food was great
The Tuna Tar Tar was fantastic! Thanks Again
i have been dining at eatery for years now and the only thing that i have noticed is that the quality just gets better
This place is hands down the best comfort food in the city
It's hip decor and friendly staff are second only to the food
I dine out alot, (as do we all) and i keep finding myself back at Eatery
You simply can't beat this trendy Hell's Kitchen restaurant
I recomend it to everyone
Meatloaf the way I wish my mama made
This place is super cool, super fun and lotsa hella good comfort food
My date ordered the Mac and Jack and I fell in love
Don't go, unless you want the same
I had the Watermelon martini and longed for a swimming pool to lounge by
a winter taste of summer fun
Delicious! Treat yourself, I did
wow this place is great!!! I have lived in the neighborhood my whole life, and have just recently given this trendy spot a chance
The staff was inviting and friendly, the food was excellent ( i recomend the ravioli) and the ambiance was relaxed and hip
i love it hear and i think i just became a regular
Give it a try i promise you'll love it
If you are looking for a fun and local HK restaurant, look for the big, purple E
The staff is welcoming, the food is great and the speciality drinks from the E-bar are even better
American comfort food with a twist is this restaurant's flair
Eatery is a busy NY restaurant, especially for pre-theatre dining and on the weekends
I suggest making a reservations
I live in the neighborhood and could bever find good food without compromising service, or vice-a-versa, until I finally found the Eatery! They have the most amazing food with the best staff in this city
Amazingly affordable, you will not find a better place than this trendy midtown restaurant!
WE MET OUR DAUGHTER HERE BEFORE HAIRSPRAY AND HAD A VERY GOOD MEAL
MY DAUGHTER RAVES ABOUT THE ASIAN STYLE CHICKEN SALAD AND I ENJOYED MY SALMON DISH VERY MUCH
THE SERVICE WAS FRIENDLY AND EFFICIANT

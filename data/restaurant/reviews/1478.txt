I love the spring rolls and the spicy basil udon with shrimp
The service is cordial and quick and the ambiance is very modern
You definitely should try it
Delicious pad thai and dumplings
Service was efficient and waitress was attentive
A great place for a work lunch--our entrees were on the table in 10 minutes
The environment was very calming and lovely
By comparison, Spice seems like prison food served in a doctors busy waiting room
Usually places with such nice ambience have subpar food or sky-high prices, but Cafetasia was quite the exception
The spring rolls were to die for and the ginger chicken/shrimp dumplings were quite delectable
Let's not forget the most important part of one's dining experience- the DRINKS
The drinks here were delicious
One night my friend and I ordered 6 appetizers and 1 drink and the bill was under $40
That's almost unheard of in NYC
Oh, and the service was great!! None of that pretentious nonsense
I highly recommend Cafetasia as a date spot, or just a nice place to chill for drinks and eats w/friends
Finally a girl can get a well-made, inexpensive cocktail in a cool place from a sexy bartender! I've been in the village for four yearss, this place is going to turn me into an alcoholic
I started with the long spring rolls and then had bass somethingg or other, theis place is awesome
wow
the food is two thum up, the decor is very very beautiful, and the service is great the owner is very nice
i love the cheese and crab ragoon
but the music have to go
It's got a nice decor and, for a Thai restaurant, a pretty adversome menu
It's also a decent addition to a very blah part of town
What a cool new place for Thai food!!! Lunch menu is only 7$ for a main plus an appatizer
I'm so happy coz there was only fast food around that block
At night you'll see candles floating
I like the ambience, casual and chic
Very resonable price!
A great value for the money
A tasting from about forty of the top culinary establishments in Queens and free drinks!! A great event to bring a friend or client to, great food, lots of choices, great conversation topics and you get to walk around and interact with the crowd
My wife and I went there last year and had a blast! There are loads of restaurants that give you tastings of their best dishes
It really goes to show that Queens really is a melting pot because so many of the dishes would be next to impossible to find anywhere else in NYC- or maybe even the east coast
It's definitely worth checking out
We'll be back
I recently hosted a farewell party for a family who would be leaving New York, and we had it at CHANTO restaurant
They were very flexible for the party menu
The food was excellent including their original sushi
Their signature cocktails were delicious
The wait staff was very attentive and friendly
The dcor was attractive
We all had such a great time!
More midtown than 7th Avenue, a little formal for the neighborhood, but that's part of the charm
A lovely dining roommodern, serious, a little ironic (chrystal chandeliers overhead, meditative mutiple laquor squares on the wall
As for the cuisine, not your ordinary Japanese
Complex and satisfying appetizers, such as sashimi wrapped in kim chee and a de-boned chicken wing filled with dumpling stuffing
A savory short ribs dish was lovely as was my softshell crab tempora
Some dishes a few many ingredient, but many restaurants are guilty of this
chef trying to top chef
But I left the table more than satisfied
and will return
Half-priced sushi rolls they advertised on a paper were what made us decide to go to this new place in the neighborhood
But it turned out theres more to CHANTO than just sushi rolls
To our surprise their non-sushi dishes were great
(Undoubtedly their sushis are great
A roll is half priced if you say the password
) Their delicious and reasonably-priced food should make many other expensive upscale restaurants feel ashamed
We were told that CHANTO means Do it right
That's exactly what this restaurant is doing
This is a Japanese restaurant of a kind
The food is amazing
The staff is all nice
The price is reasonable
We had their prix fixe menu, which is an appetizer, an entre, a dessert, and some other small plates
Among its choices, the seared Yellow Tail sashimi and Teriyaki Foie Gras are to die for
We definitely recommend this place
We really loved it
We went to Chanto restaurant simply because we saw their ad on a paper
Not knowing what to order from their menu, we tried their prix fixe menu, which turned out to be a 6-course meal
That was well worth its price ($45)
Each of the dishes served was amazing and delicious
Especially the crab croquette was exceptional
It spread out its taste and aroma the moment it was put in my mouth
The desserts were great, too
Their yuzu scented cheese cake, my wife is claiming, was a charmingly perfect marriage of western taste and Japanese flavor
Also, the wine/sake list was diverse
Staff was friendly, attentive and patient, adding to the overall comfort of the great dining experience
This jewel in West Village is sure to become one of our favorite spots
The menu is invoative and, with the exception of the sushi, each menu item was superb
The ribs, the tuna carpacio and the tuna ravioli are all to die for
The sushi is mediocre, by comparison, due in part to the cool temerature of the rice it is served on
The atmosphere is elegant, although the projected fireplace is tacky
Overall a great pick
This place was excellent
The service was exceptional as well as the food
The food was extremely exquisite
I loved it and I highly recommend to those who want great food, service and ambiance
My girlfriend's birthday was the other day and a friend of mine suggested that I take her to Chanto, a new Japanese restaurant in the west village
Wow! As soon as we were escorted to our table the entire staff shouted something to us in Japanese (which I later found out was welcome
) This set the tone for Chanto's atmosphere
The lights were perfect for a date (warm and not too bright)
The staff was friendly and gave us exceptional care (three of our dishes were cut or mixed in front of us)
The food was not only mouthwateringly good but it was also filling (a trait, in my experience, not indeginous to Japanese restaurants
) As icing on the cake, the staff, perhaps overhearing that it was my girlfriend's birthday, brought out our dessert to the tone of all the lights off and singing happy birthday!! MUST GO RESTAURANT!!
We went to Chanto for the second time
It was a good restaurant the first time, but it's a great restaurant now
Each dish, delicious but rustic before, has been refined to be really sophisticated to its perfection
Seared yellowtail sashimi, one of specials of the day, was not just beautifully arranged on an artistic plate but was so yummy as if they were melting in my mouth
My favorite Sweet and Sour pork, which once was served brusquely just in a bowl last time, was now nicely accompanied with fresh green vegetables and steamed rice elegantly wrapped in a bamboo leaf
Recommended by a tall sake sommelier of the restaurant, we tried the sake flight

The actual cruise was breathtaking and was especially beautiful once we stopped at the Statue of Liberty (another native New Yorker who has never seen it up close!)
The food, awful
the service horrid! The waiters uniforms were filthy (made you not really want to eat!) The appetizer that I got was supposed to have chicken
well I think they drained a few cans of Campbells Chicken Noodle Soups and took the chicken from there and put it in the food
Just horrible! I will do the Circle Line next time and go to a restaurant to eat!
Being a Native New Yorker, never have I experienced such wonderful sevice and great food until I dined aboard World Yacht! Not to mention the always changing views of this city that I so dearly adore
What a wonderful night out! We danced until the yacht docked and sipped coffee on the top floor outside under the stars
A definite MUST DO!
A perfectly lovely evening! Ambience is un-paralleled; service is top of the line; the views are breathtaking
But the cherry on top has got to be the food
It's an absolute must for tourists and locals alike! You'll come away in a York State of Mind!
Fun for the whole family! The food and service are excellent!
A beautiful way to relax while enjoying the city's skyline and a delicious meal and evening of entertainment
Executive Chef Patrick Augustyn's winning menu is getting accolades from all over
Plan a romantic dinner for two or get social with a party of six or eight
Memorable moments are in the offing
Enjoy!
For a romantic and elegant dining experience--World Yacht Dinner Cruises is the place to be
Where else can you float among the stars and lose yourself in NY harbor while sipping champagne and eating cavier
The food is deliciously gourmet
Service is exceptional
Surround yourself with candlelight
Pamper yourself and do it right--go World Yacht!
Spectacular skyline views for a special event
If you expect high-end restaurant food
you will be disappointed
Go knowing that the food is strictly catering hall quality and you will still have a good time
(So-called recipes from well-known chefs poorly executed
Appetizer of smoked chicken sundried tomatoes on pasta had 1 tomato NO chicken
waiter said that's how it's prepared - NO CHICKEN!?) Another bit of advice: if you enjoy conversations with your dinner guest(s)
ask for a table away from the live music
My family and I have been buying cakes, cookies, pastires, you name it, from Pozzo's for over 40 years now
They're family owned and operated, and have never been a disappointment
If you ever need to grab a birthday cake in a hurry, they're the place to go to
I order cakes from them all the time and they are always very well received
They offer good quality pastries and at a very reasonable price (especially by Manhattan standards) - plus they deliver (also at a reasonable delivery charge)
I haven't been able to find any other bakery that would even come close to their prices and/or quality in the Times Square area a lot of them don't deliver at all
So I recommend Pozzo to everyone
If you like stale cake, this is the bakery for you
I ordered a raspberry mousse birthday cake for my Mother's birthday
The cake appeared fresh but when we ate the cake it was horrible-the chocolate cake part was stale and dry and fell apart
It was as if the cake part had been made days earlier
When I called to address this issue the person who answered the phone told me that they do not bake each cake fresh but make many cake pieces and then use them for a couple of days to construct the cakes
However they believe the cake would still be fresh and told me it was impossible for the cake to be stale
For the money they charge the cake should be fresh and baked the day it is ordered
In Short Owner Amy Scherber opened this, her first bakery, on Ninth Avenue in Hell's Kitchen in 1992
She's since expanded to the Chelsea Market, where most of the bread is now baked for all the stores, and then to a location on Bleecker
Most renowned for breads incorporating olives, herbs, nuts, even prosciutto, the bakery also features cakes like Red Velvet and coconut cream
Sandwiches and salads are available for take-out lunches
a culinary friend introduced me to amy's bread
it was warm in there, but uh
it's a bakery
hello?? i know; talk baked goods, not climate
i lugged bags home and gorged, in the privacy of my own home, a couple of chocolate twists, sourdough bread, a black olive twist, a cinnamon raisin twist, and my favorite
a half dozen ginger snaps
yea! there's something about ginger snaps in autumn
it's as though you're consuming the season in sweetness
the goods were fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced
the bakery was packed during that particular weekday afternoon, and as i struggled to pass through well-jacketed baked gooders and escape out the door, i knew i would return
for those cheese biscuits i have yet to delight in
enjoy
My husband and I ate breakfast at Amy's Bread just about every morning on our vacation in NYC in July of 2003
The sticky buns and cheese biscuits are the best I have ever had!
The Scene This traditional Italian restaurant near Times Square is on every tourist's to-do list
Decorated with spotlighted portraits and black-and-white photographs, the massive main dining room holds multitudes--but you'll still line up for an hour or more without a reservation
Large groups here for a celebration will love the raucous atmosphere; those in search of quiet conversation will hate it
Despite the hubbub, service is cheerful and efficient
The Food Count on going home with a doggy bag: The enormous portions are sized for three to four people, which makes for great value but much negotiation, especially if you're a couple
All the garlic-saturated dishes come on strong with robust flavors
Rich sauces make pastas a good bet, but chicken marsala and salmon special are middle-of-the-road and veal is rather ropey
After all the heat, strawberry shortcake with whipped cream makes for a cool, refreshing dessert
I went here early Feb
2006 for a friends birthday
The 7 of us (guys) had only 2 appetizers and 4 entrees! We came hungry and left very full and satisfied
I'd definitely be coming back
The atmosphere is definitely geared towards groups so don't expect a romantic night out here
The prices are very fair
My first trip to NY and a friend that lives there recommended Carmine's
It was wonderful!! Large portions
great food
The chicken parmesan was to die for
Best I have ever had
Atmosphere wonderful, waitstaff friendly
I LOVED IT AND WILL GO AGAIN MY NEXT TRIP TO NY!
The staff at Carmine's are always rude
I've given this restaurant three chances and it failed miserably every time
The food is nothing special--just huge helpings of thick pasta and overly-rich sauces
The caesar salad is good
Eating at the bar is a nightmare
Don't even think about going before a show on the weekends
I tried that on a Friday, told the guy otside the door that I did not have a reservation and he said, You may as well just leave now
Go to Virgil's BBQ across Times Square for polite service and awesome food
The wait was long, the place was crowded and loud but I expected this from a place with a reputation as stellar as Carmine's
It's fair to say that I was ravenous and my feet were very sore by the time our party was seated so it was going to take more than average cuisine to impress me
The wait and the pain was totally worth it
Yes it was pricey but I expected that
I had the opportunity to sample several of their dishes as I was in a party of 12 for a friend's birthday so their were about 8 different dishes at the table
Everything that crossed my palate was delicious
Go and wear an elastic waistband
Please do not go with a party of less than four

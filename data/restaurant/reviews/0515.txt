Any way you go, I'm sure that once you try it it will become like the place you call home
Here's another Italian option in Astoria and it's like eating over your italian friend's house
The ambience is reminiscent of the Brady Brunch dining room or a Southern greasy spoon located just off the highway
The food, however, is what's really important, right? And it's good- it's VERY good- it's GREAT, and cheap! We ordered the goat cheese to start- what a creation! Served with warm bread, it's a homemade spread worthy of praise
The Fettucine Alfredo was appropriately cheesy and dense but the show stopper was the Linguine with white clam sauce
It was probably the BEST, freshest, tastiest white clam sauce I've ever had, all dressed up with little neck clams
RECOMMEND!! Don't go there on a first date or when you're dressed up, but please, GO and GO often! CIAO
I love going to Phillies
Great food, great service, and great space
The chef is really cool and very friendly, the waitress (Billy) is sooooo sweet and very attentive, and the new bartender makes a killer drink
Been to this place at least a half a dozen times, and I can't wait to go back for more!
An All around terrific time for friends, couples families, or just yourself
The ambiance was delightful and fun
There are not enough places that offer indoor and out door seating - a thumbs up in itself
Delicious food and a great time! Very well worth leaving another borough or staying in your own
four shining stars on all ends!!!!
My friends and I love dining at different restaurants, so when I heard about Phillies in Astoria, we just had to check it out
It was EXQUISITE Italian dining
First we had drinks at the cocktail bar
We then ordered different entrees from the menu and each one was delectable
Everything about the restaurant experience was perfect: from the professional and comforting service to the gorgeous outside dining
There is no doubt about it-we will be going back to Phillies very very soon! I highly recommend this restaurant for an amazing dining experience
A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND I ATTENDED PHILLIES THE OTHER NIGHT
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT OUT, THE BEST WEATHER WE HAD IN A LONG TIME, AND WE SAT OUTSIDE IN THE BACK
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
THE RESTAURANT ITSELF IS DECORATED BEAUTIFULLY, AND THE OUTSIDE WAS SO RELAXING WITH THE LITTLE PONDS AND WATERFALLS
IT FELT LIKE I WAS EATING IN A LITTLE TOWN IN ITALY!
THE FOOD IS BEYOND AMAZING
THE STAFF AND CHEF ARE ENTERTAINING
IT WAS A VERY FUN ATOMOSPHERE, ALONG WITH A RELAXING ONE
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PHILLIES
IT IS DEFINATLY ONE OF MY TOP CHOICES!
What a great little spot
the food is wonderful, the service A+, and I felt like i was sitting in my dining room with family
Everything the chef makes is to order, so everything is fresh and delicious
This is our 4th or 5th time at phillies, we now make it a weekly event
YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!
How delicious! Food was excellent! The atmosphere is great, the staff is wonderful
there isn't a bad word I can say
I was very pleased with my visit to Phillies and I can't wait to take some more friends to taste the great food! I highly recommend! Great little place in Astoria!
I was talked into a blind date by some friends, we were to meet a Phillies
Well the date went great
but the food was even better!!! We started with apts
fired ravios and the best baked clams I have ever tasted in my life
Dinner was fantastic, I felt like I was at Grandmas for sunday dinner
The outdoor sitting was such a plus
quiet and very romantic
The staff was very friendly, I felt like we knew eachother for years
AND best of all the prices were very reasonable
(lucky for my date)
Phillies has just become my favorite place to go with this guy or anyother!!! P
S Don't forget about the desserts
they make HOMEMADE cheesecake
yum!!!!
I'm surprised to be the first person to review this place, given its popularity on Ditmars in Astoria
I had to see for myself what was so impressive about the place and within 15 minutes of placing my order I had found out why
My food was ready and piping hot while the friendly delivery person had change to spare
They make food nearly as fast as the fast food joints out there, except the ingredients are fresh and portions are huge
Each time I've ordered delivery, my wait has been no more than 15-20 minutes long and this is probably only because I live 6 blocks away
Even when I order for pick up, I'm told its only going to be ready in roughly 2 minutes
One thing to note that while the delivery is impressive and the food preparation is fast, the food itself is not best I've had
My favorite dish is their Mexican pizza and their nachos, but don't go into this place expecting fancy Mexican fare, because it will surely disappoint
It is also Chinese owned and operated, so Spanish speaking patrons may find it difficult to order especially over the phone
Recommended on a night for those who are looking to save money and who lack delivery patience
Standards for cleanliness by these Polish immigrant owners is very low
If the state cracked down on this area, numerous health violations would be found
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats
We got lunchmeat from here twice and both times it went bad in 2-3 days
Stay AWAY!!!
If you're looking for awesome grilled food at the most affordable price, this is the place
Great wine chart and the food portions are just in the huge range
They definitly caught the comfort aspect because the resturant is small but cozy
The food is well portioned and um um good!! Our waiter was everything a waiter should be!!! The curried shrimp and oxtails are must!!
Firstly I didn't see a sign saying this a Jamaican Restaurant this is a fine place to eat, Quaint,speak easy type setting, hold hands and get a little kiss before a meal type of place
you know Mamma's place; any persons Mamma
the food is very good, so, stop in before you roll out
The menu at Mobay's seems to be bastardized to appeal to an African American soul food market
Please, pray tell, how does a Jamaican restaurant serve Fried Catfish, Candied Yams, Macaroni and Cheese and Red Velvet Cake (all African American) and NOT offer BASICS like Fish Tea, Bread Fruit or Black Cake on its menu? Furthermore, when knowledgeable patrons inquire into authentic Jamaican cuisine by name, they shouldnt be met with perplexed expressions from the wait staff
If it is Mobays intent to serve up an amalgamation of soul food/West Indian cuisine than perhaps they should choose a less confusing name like, The Adulterated Jamaican Kitchen
If you are interested in experiencing pure Jamaican cuisine in a wide assortment, than look elsewhere
Unfortunately you will find the menu at Mobays to be too cluttered with soul food items for you to find many of your favorites from back-a-yard
Mobay's has become one of the classic soul food Harlem restaurants
They must have really considered initial feedback from a couple of years ago because my first visit last week was fantastic! Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service
The food did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute waiters' jokes and friendliness made up for it
I am a native New Yorker, born and raised in brooklyn and I have been to many many restaurants
This was by far the best food I have ever eaten
I had the blackened catfish and rum cake
The red velvet cake is amazing as well
I am most definitely going back for more
The only downside is that the place is small, but the food and prices can not be beat
If great food is what you seek, do not miss out in this place
A few standouts on the menu: BBQ chicken, Curry Chicken, Curry Shrimp and Jerk Chicken
Rummy Rum Cake also is great! Service is Okay at the restaurant, I like to go on weeknights to avoid the weekend craziness
We love the food at Mo-bay but have to be in the mood to deal with the S-L-O-W service
The servers don't seem to be all that concerned whether or not their customers are satisfied
We tried delivery instead a few times, that's not much better, takes an HOUR for food to get two blocks to our apartment
I've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend's birthday and I always enjoy myself
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied
The service is great
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party

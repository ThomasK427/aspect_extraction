Nicely presented, but lacking
The duck was bland and dry, same with the steak
But still I find the experience worth the trip
Also the lamb, parpadelle is great!!!
What a let down! We started out with yummy appetizers and a bottle of wine
Our entrees (I had rabbit and my sister ordered the pork) both resembled bad wedding reception fare
I had about three bites and the waiter didn't even question my virutally untouched plate
The waiter also cleared our wine glasses before we had finished
We felt rushed and unimpressed with the staff
The gentleman who seated us wore a wrinkled untucked tuxedo shirt
COME ON! I hope it was a bad night because I had higher expectations for a Todd English establishment
Everything I have ever tried here has been absolutely incredible
The menu is very unique, and offers a wide variety of unusual but amazing dishes
The service could not be more perfect - they are incredibly attentive, but very relaxed and casual, and make you feel so comfortable
I really can't say enough good things about this place
The service was fast and efficient
The wine was perfectly chilled and perfectly presented
The desserts were delicious and creative
I had high expectations of a declicious brunch at Olives, given the reputation of the exec
chef
However- the ceasar salad was soggy and the french toast also soggy (not even Challah bread) -- and to top it off the bartender couldn't make our drinks right! Don't waste your money on the food, and don't expect personal service and attention
I've eaten here a few times and it is always good
The black green olive spread for the bread is tasty
I recommend getting the tuna with spinach and polenta topped with fried calamari
If you are on a date I also recommend requesting one of the tables that is enclosed by a sheet hanging from the ceiling
It's private in there
And if you really want privacy you can get a room in the hotel
I had brunch here - not only were dishes substandard but the prices were outrageous
By far the worst brunch place in NYC
I was shocked at how bad the food was here
I had heard that it was a great place, but the food was outrageously overpriced, and it wasn't even good
Definitely a place to skip -- completely not worth it
You can find ambience at a place with decent food, and this is not the place!
really nice restaurant
beautiful open kitchen
appetizer- gross, entree- gross, strawberry dessert- gross
(how is a dessert gross?) bill: $90 each
would have preferred a slice of pizza
Went with a friend on Saturday night, and we were very impressed
Apart from a slight hitch when we tried to check in for our 8
15 reservation at 8
25 and the girl at the desk looked about to try and bump us as she had it down at 8
00 (quickly resolved by a smooth, non-petty manager), everything was pretty near perfect
The Olives tart was delicious, as was my chicken and my friend's red snapper
We didn't make it to dessert, but I certainly hope to next time
The service was perfection, attentive and charming but not overbearing
I look forward to returning soon
Todd English has a winning NYC establishment! Everything for our early Sunday dinner was near perfection! Wonderful and prompt service, inventive and incredibly delicious dishes (the goat cheese ravioli special was AMAZING as was the olives tart--for entrees the pork loin and veal saltimboca are must-haves)
Kudos to pastry chef Lincoln Carson for the molten cake duo (although the milk chocolate was definitely better)
Olives pleases even the most discriminating palates
I did find the portions to be on the small side, especially for the price, but I was also there almost 9 months ago
so perhaps things are different
The Scene Inside, the restaurant feels almost tent-like
Entering the candle-filled space is like opening the doors on Christmas in a gypsy vagabond hideaway
The Food Traditional and interpretive tapas that throws a sharp focus on the definitive themes of Spanish cuisine
Few styles of cooking place such an importance on texture--baby eels in a sizzling slick of oil, for example, is nudged just a shade away from pasta by the crackle of tiny bones under your teeth
Garlic is another constant, with its fascinating range of application throughout a meal--from subtle background agent to aggressive palate-prickler
Was there this past weekend to celebrate an engagement! Cute, intimate and great food
Sangria is also awesome!
Pipa has some real old world charm that you don't really notice from the outside
It's dark, and dimly lit with candles and chandeliers, kind of like being inside an old castle and kind of romantic
The food is amazing and during times when it's slow, you are also able to order from sister restaurant Lucy's Kitchen
The duck breast was amazing and they have a great, extensive wine list
the food is great, sangria is delicious and the atmosphere is very romantic
the piggy back dates are to die for
highly recommend!
The food and ambiance is great in this restaurant that I have now been to a few times
However, each time I am surprised by the slowness of the initial service to the extreme fast pace of the food to come out
When you initially sit down, the waiter takes quite some time to make it to your table
However, once you order, all the food comes in an incredible speed making your conversations concentrate at the beginning and end of the dinner
If only this could be improved
I really want to love this place b/c it's in such a fantastic, magical space, but I need a much better value
I ordered assorted olives which consisted of two kinds, the majority were tiny caper-size kind that are all pit and no meat
Next the bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates were delicious but with only 4 dates on your plate, I felt jipped
Lastly, I had patatas bravas
better than what I had in Barcelona
but lets get real! All they are is home fries with aioli! Finally the sangria was expensive grape juice
Maybe Im a lush, but I expect sangria to have a little kick esp
after 5 glasses! Lastly, the bartender didnt give me detailed bill, just my credit card receipt to sign
I asked for it, but he shrugged me off and since it was a birthday I didnt want to make a fuss in front of everyone
Food, service and ambience was great, but $112 for 4 tapas and a pitcher of Sangria is not good value
Simple the best I've ever had in my life
I been here several time the tappas are excellent
The main dishes are decent, you probably won't be able to finish both plates
Also very happy with the service
The service was average
It took a while for the waiter to actually get to us, even though the restaurant was virtually empty at the time
The atmosphere is fine but a little overrated - the light was so low that we had trouble reading our menus
We ordered seafood and were very specific as to make sure the dish had no meat, 30 minutes later we had, although a very delicious, plate WITH pork in front of us
Since it took so long we just picked out the pork - still it ruined the momentum
I would go back only if there was no other choice, or just for tapas
For well over a year Pipa was my favorite restaurant
I went there for anniversaries, birthdays, when friends visited, and just cuz
Then about 3 years ago I went with friends for my birthday and was so thoroughly offended by the extraordinarily bad service that I vowed never to return, and I stayed true to my word
Nevertheless, recently friends told me new management was in charge and that the food and service were better than ever
Armed with a healthy dose of skepticism, I decided to check out the new Pipa
Am I ever glad I did! The service was EXCELLENT: friendly, attentive, and prompt
The atmosphere strikes perfectly the balance between a party (relaxed, great music, great drinks) and intimacy (not so loud you can't talk, low lighting, classy decor)
As for food--delicioso! Try the seafood croquetas, and if you go earlier try the smoked salmon sandwich
Where is my friend Chef Douglas Rodriguez?? I've been going to Pipas since it opened

The crowd has many Japanese people, business men, and neighborhood residents
It is very casual and friendly
Have been to Eamonn's several times since finding it accidentally over Christmas, and my wife and I have found the restaurant to be relaxing and friendly, with excellent food
Though not a sports bar, the charming staff have always accomodated us with whatever games we wished to watch, and I look forward to visiting Eamon's on future weekends
This bar is amazing
My GF and I have been here 4 times now and have had a good experience each time
The bartenders are friendly though not real talkative
The food is unbelievably good (One of the better steaks I have had outside of home)
Great crowd and friendly
Beer is good and the selections are also good
The watressing leaves a little to be desired
We got Bread plates but no bread and when a table next to us finally got their bread they had to ask for butter, but again the food was delicious
i've dined there a few times with friends and i love it
we were greeted by a friendly and smiling hostess
the back area is my favorite, its cozy, private if you take a corner table and romantic
during the week lunch is pretty busy and may be difficult to get a table however its worth the wait
the burgers are the best and the apple pie is great
the staff members are cheerful, friendly and pretty!!!
Typically frequent Eamon's for business lunches, but have noticed a recent downword trend in the quality of service
Wait staff is seemingly non-existant, and food servers are way too agressive - our food was thrown on the table, and even knocked a member of my party in the head with a plate with little acknowledgement
Eamon's is slightly more than the average pub, and with that should be the expecation of better service
After being publically questioned on my poor tip for poor service, I will not be returning
The waitresses were friendly enough when you could find them, but it did take a lot of YOO HOO! OVER HERE! HELLO!! to get their attention
The maitre'd was not a Jolly Mr
Niceguy, though
But maybe he was upset that we asked to be seated away from the OVERPOWERING NOISE and equally overpowering refrigeration
One member said it's a little like a jazz club but feels more like a fake urban bar in Tennessee
But another thought it was a great time
--Drink Club (a weekly roving club of NYC drinkers)
having met clients at the nearby roosevelt hotel,we decided on eamonns bar grill for a late lunch
upon entering we were seated upstairsin a cheerful,spacious dinning room
a pleasant,friendly waitress brought 3 creamy pts of guinness and a pinot gregio to wet our whistles
the lady ordered the tricolor fusili primavera(veg) and the guys opted for 3 steaks(2 sirlion 1 gaelic style)cooked to prefection with homestyle steak fries and veg
skipping desserts we went downstairs to the main bar which was filling up with young professionals eager to unwind after the office
unfortunately,we had to leave the scene(as it was heating up)for the short trek to GCT to catch the 7 to shea but these met fans will certainly be back!
I usually avoid midtown restaurants because they're usually disappointments and this one was no different
We were seated in uncomfortable seats (think bar stools), it was hard to hear the person just two feet across from me (despite the fact that it was a slow Saturday afternoon), and the service was poor (again, despite the fact that it was a slow Saturday afternoon)
I was actually surprised when my stuffed chicken breast, mashed potatoes, and mixed veggies tasted yummy
My boyfriend's duck, however, was some of the worst duck we'd tasted in a while
We won't be returning to this place
The salt and pepper shakers are all collectors items
boy and girl, ferris wheels
etc etc
The food is average
on the mexican flare side
service is decent
Just a good place for brunch on the weekend
Nothing to write home about, but a great neighborhood joint to grab a casual bite to eat
Decent food, nicely prepared, good sized portions, etc
in a cute setting with very friendly wait staff
Cheap food doesn't have to be junk
While there is junkfood on the menu, there are plenty of options for the health junkie
I moved around the corner from this place and I basically subsisted on the food at Lola's for the first 2 weeks after my move, and since then I have become a regular
I like anything with chicken, and the fish tacos are good too
Unfortunately, the fries are subpar
They use fresh potatoes, but they're not done right, so they come out brown but raw in the middle
I wish they would fix the fries
I went to this spot after examining the menu in Appetite for a year
I was lured in by the fact that they have soy options for almost everything that includes dairy on the menu, as well as tofu subs for eggs; It is hard to find mexican tinged food with an optional vegetarian slant
Don't be put off by the minimal decor, the food is fantastic and a great value
My huevos Racheros were fantastic
Plus $5 pint glasses of Sangria!!
Steak frites alert! A standout French bistro on Atlantic Avenue
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene Another French bistro is the last thing this neighborhood needed, but that hasn't stopped Smith Street locals from showing up in droves
The railroad dining room, decorated with antique wine presses, distressed mirrors and simple wood tables, attracts a laid-back yet food-serious crowd
If you're feeling social, sit in the clubby bar area, where the gregarious owners chat up regulars; the wood-wrapped back room and leafy, smoke-friendly garden is more relaxing
The Food  It's surprising just how good familiar French bistro food can be
Rich-stocked French onion soup is chock-full of caramelized onions under a bubbly blanket of cheese
Steak frites--juicy, buttery (sometimes too much so) and nicely charred--arrives with a heap of crispy fries, and homey dishes, like moist roasted rabbit in a mustardy glaze, couldn't be more satisfying
Only a loose creme brulee and uninspired cheese-charcuterie plate can stand improvement
After waiting twenty minutes, we were finally seated, another ten minutes passed until a waiter approached us
A waiter rushed us through the specials and brought us the bottle of wine we ordered
Bacchus ran out of breadbaskets and bread! They brought us a tiny plate with toasted wonder bread and one slice of french bread
The foie gras was not fresh
the oysters
also not so fresh
Medium rare filet at Bacchus translates to tough red meat almost well done
The leg of lamb was fair but, like the filet, was served luke warm
The desserts were fine, nothing special- warm chocolate cake and a caramel meringue
We had full wine glasses and the manager asked us to get up and move to a table at the bar so they could seat a larger party in the space we occupied
Poor, inattentive yet rushed service
combined with substandard food
I have been going to Baccus since its first days and Although the friendliness of the owners kept me coming back, the food was ok but not that special
Now, I have to say that they have put it toghether
Food has been consistently good for a while and still at a great price
But their most amazing feature is their wine list
It can rival any upscale French restaurant but was kept at a very reasonable price
The owners are passionate about wine and love to talk about it
Baccus is going to be there for a while
Great!
Compared to the droves of mediocre restaurants on nearby Smith Street, Bacchus is a gem
It's the closest I've found to a real French bistro
The steak and coq au vin stand out
It's great for a date
the garden is very romantic
And the wine list is superb
This is a very warm, affordable neighborhood restaurant
It opened within the last year and each time I've visited I think the food has gotten better and better (after a so-so start)
Although the staff overall may not be so outgoing, the owner is extremely warm and friendly and welcomes you as if it was his home
The prices are very affordable and the ambiance in the garden or enclosed patio is lovely

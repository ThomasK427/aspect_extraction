Went there last night with some friends who had all been there before
The food was decent--yes, the mac and cheese is really that good--but the waitstaff couldn't have been worse
The bartender and host were fabulous (friendly and accomodating--try the Liquid Passion drink), but our waitress was terrible--practically refused to exchange the regular soda she brought my friend for the Diet she asked for
Then another waiter was shooting dirty looks at our table all night, shaking his head at us, maybe we weren't dressed funky enough or something
I have never been treated so rudely by a waiter
I can't stand the people working at this place
the mac and cheese is among the best - if not the best - in town
the staff is nice, the ambience is sleek and clean, and the prices are very reasonable
the turkey and beef burgers are thick and flavorful
the turkey burger is truly a turkey burger: seasoned flavor with w/real turkey, and not dry
the desserts are enormous and are impossible for even 2 people to finish
one of the best deals in town
As a tourist from London I really enjoyed this place - despite clearly ordering a chicken cesar salad but receiving a chicken
well, not quite sure but it sure wasn't a ceasar salad
Nonetheless it was delicious
Wait-staff were very easy on the eye, service was quick friendly (in a way you just don't get this side of the pond) and there was a very definite vibe about the place (added to by some very hot stick-thin drop-dead-gorgeous models masticating on salad)
As a tourist, and probably as a local, I think there are worse places to sit and watch the world go by over a decent meal
One word of warning
be beautiful, or else learn to breath in for at least an hour at a time
What a great restraunte! I went there last saturday with a friend from out of town
The atmosphere is great, the staff beautiful, and the food just as excellent! The pumpkin bisque alone made it a great meal
Out of fairness, I went to this place on two separate occassions, but had the same level of service and the same food quality both times
The bread they brought to our table was so burnt that we couldn't even eat it
The infamous maccheese was also burnt
My veggie burger came out a bit on the gooey side, with the bun being burnt
My partner's turkey burger was nearly raw
The service is not good at all
There are better places to eat in NYC
If you're starving, and you absolutely can't find any other place to eat, I would still have second thoughts about coming here
I love this place
The food is exactly what you want in these troubled times
No fuss comfort food
Cafeteria has held on to it's coolness despite the onslaught of the B T crowd to every venue that gets two words in any magazine
The service is friendly and on top of things
They seem to manage the drunken trash quite well
I love the outdoor seating and when they have the doors open this place is exactly where you want to be
The only other place would be the lounge downstairs
Oh yeah, and the prices are so reasonable you have to wonder how they make any money
This place is really ideal for the dinner before you go out sort of thing
It has fantastic mac and cheese, great desserts, and the drinks aren't too bad either
I found the ambience a bit shih-shih, but you'll warm up to it before long
i always go here for brunch or after a long night of lounging/partying
the eggs benedict with smoked salmon is SOOOOO good and the alcoholic concoctions are yummy too
it's a little loud, but you kind of expect that from a place named cafeteria
The food was excellent
I would strongly recommend the honey roasted turkey and obviously mac-n-cheese! Also, for desset get the peanut butter cup
It was out of this world
I enjoyed the decor
The staff was also very friendly except we got stuck with a brain dead waitress
I would go back in a second!
This is the best place to see any number of celebrities on a daily basis
Yesterday I saw Harrison Ford Calista Flockhart having lunch
In addition, I've seen many other celebrities dining on their favorite home cooked foods in a hip, casual downtown scene
Cafeteria is a understated staple for me, where I can dine shoulder to shoulder with the colorful people of our unique city
This place used to be nice, but it's overrun by JERSEY people and wanna be's
It's actually embarassing to be seen here now! If the service was nice or the food not so boring I might go, but it's soooooooo not worth it anymore
I'm just glad Elmo is across the street, I only wish it was 24 hrs
Cafeteria has become a Chelsea institution, and if it's no longer model-lookalike central, it's still a fun, inexpensive place to hang with your friends, scarf down some seriously good mac cheese, and throw back a blueberry mojito or three
The service has gotten much better and friendlier over the years, while the menu's tried-and-true basics are dependably decent
My personal choices: that great mac cheese; the huge slab of meat loaf; and a nicely chewy hangar steak
Tip: Cafeteria works best as a late-night option; not only is the crowd more festive, but by daylight, those brown leather banquettes and white plastic chairs are beginning to look a little ragged
This joint is pretty allright
I'd come back if I were in the neighborhood
But there are better choices all around
I was a little worried that Cafeteria would be a burger and macaroni and cheese place
It isn't
Great salads, even the bread was good
Cheap too
Nice atmosphere - dimly lit and modern
Terrible drinks though
great place for brunch - if you are not in a rush! and also has a tasty mac n' cheese (please see above title)
very loud, swanky bar, food is alright and overpriced, very small and smokey, not enough seating downstairs, long wait for table
Don't get too excited by the menu as nothing comes out nearly as good as you'd like it to
There are several diners in the area that are much more worthwhile
Living in the area, I always notice hordes of people eating here, but I never thought they were crazy until I myself had a meal
The service is pretty, but the food is horribly lacking
This is one of the over-hyped places in the neighborhood that people go to to be seen
The food is mediocre and I would never go again
The food looks great
, but I did not stay long enough because of the attitude of staff
We obviously were not fashionably chic enough for the door staff, we received glances that were reserved for peasants
The bartender was even worse
I love going here after a late night out
It is quite a scene with a wide variety of people to see
The food is good too, but not the service!
Cafeteria has been a favorite of mine for a long time! The food has been consistently good and the COSMOS are awesome! I usually get the tuna or the mac and cheese and all I can say is
YUM!!! I disagree with the comments about the service
Unfortunately, this happens at a lot of restaurants and it's a shame that a couple of people have had bad experiences (I have not)!
I came here with friends after reading the glowing reviews on CitySearch
The only reason to come here is the ambience, which I admit is nice and better than most late night diners
But the food was average at best and the service was TERRIBLE
The worst thing is that you can't even reflect that in the tip because this place adds 18% gratuity to every meal! No wonder you never see your waiter
And they had the nerve to serve a completely burnt bagel to our table
When we pointed it out, our waiter should have at least offered to get a fresh one or take it off the tab, but he just shrugged his shoulders as if to say not my problem
Two words: DON'T BOTHER
I make it a point to stop into Cafeteria everytime I'm in the city - and usually after bar hopping when I don't have to wait for a table
I SWEAR by their calamari, but their dipping sauces make it even better
I don't know if I like the ceasar more for its fresh lettuce and tangy dressing or for that scrumptious one eyed susan it comes with
I'm one of those people who talks up this place so much that they should call me and offer me a free meatloaf or fried chicken entree at the very least, but regardless, its reasonable enough without freebies
The servers are always attractive and know it, and i want them away from the table even before they come near it

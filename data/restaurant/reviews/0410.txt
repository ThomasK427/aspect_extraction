the din is fairly loud
Came here with friends on a recent Saturday night
Food was mostly good, and the owners have done a great job with the space
It's quite small, but seems bigger due to spare design
And prices are low given the neighborhood
The only downside was the service, which was rude and unhelpful
Sure, the setting is nice
It's convenient
What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered
This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated
Definitely not worth the price! Don't go
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily
It just wasn't Thai
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood
Four of us were having a very good time there until when we got the bill
The waitress came back with the bill and money (with a calculator) and asked for more tips
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST! I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced
I will go back to Suan soon! In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal
Suan has challenged this loyalty
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!! They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige! Try the green curry!!!
Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe
Staff was cool enough to exlplain all the different sakes (they have a small but delicious selection) and make amazing recommendations
There's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it
Kudos Haru
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing
What's the difference between the two? Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request! The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share! We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
Don't let my rating mislead you
their sake choices aren't as numerous as others but the QUALITY is on point! If you're looking for a place that has GREAT sake and pretty unique sushi choices, this is where you should go
It is CRAMPED, though, so unless you plan on taking over the joint, bring only one friend
Tasty sushi / appetizers
overall the food is quality
varied saki selection, too
Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you! I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable
It ain't cheap either, but then again, cheap food ain't good and good food ain't cheap
If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar! They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you
Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them
I went with a friend of mine and spent about $100 on drinks and when we got the check, I noticed that they charged us 50cents for the rocks (ice) per drink
When the waiter noticed that we were talking how ridiculous that was, he commented that he worked in several bars and that charging for ice was common practice
I have no problem paying a lot for drinks, but I feel their practice is terrible
I WILL NEVER RETURN to their restaurant or their bar
Seafood and surprising New American combos spruce up Columbus Avenue

My taxi just drove by and I saw a huge FOR RENT sign in the window
PLEASE tell me this isn't true? Their brunches are wonderful!
I liked this place a lot the first time I ate there a couple years ago
I've taken two trips since and it has been really poor, both the food and the service
This past time, the food was served to us cold, and several dishes were simply not very good
My red wine rissotto was extremely overbearing and tasted as if it had been doused in the stuff - and it was cold to boot
The service left a lot to be desired, as we were served in shifts practically, with some dishes coming minutes after others had arrived
Not what you'd expect from a high quality restaurant, and not a cheap one either
Sorry to say, but I won't be going back
I have been there about 4x for brunch and dinner
Today was most certainly my last
It always takes 15 minutes to get water
The waiter didn't even come by to see how our meal was, not to menion that every time we go something is wrong with the meal-they give us asparagus in the omelet instead of spinach
We ordered whole wheast toast; the waiter didn't bring it until 15 minutes after we had received our brunch
Instead of whole wheat, it was thick gross white toast
When I repeated what I had ordered, the server said, we don't carry that and walked away--the table behind us had whole wheat
None of the servers has ever had an ounce of a brain- I seriously don't understand why people continue to go to SQC
I certainly will not spend a dollor on their overpriced meals and crappy service ever again
Excellent food, always as good as expected
Inventive brunch menu, and the chef/owner's friendly wife always there to greet the regulars
Also, a good bet that you can walk in and grab a table, even on a Friday night
My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of going to this restaurant on a whim on New Year's Eve
The ambiance was wonderful and I must say that the service was excellent
I don't know what these other people are talking about
we were fawned over by several servers who attended to our needs and were greated personally by the chef's wife
At this restaurant I had one of the best meals I've ever had
Try the rissotto, its delicious
Overall we were very pleased with our dining experience and surprised by the small price we had to pay for the service and excellent quality of the food
Attracted by the restaurant's asthetics and interesting menu, my friends and I dropped in for weeknight dinner
We were seated immediately at one of the better tables near the front window
The waiter was always gracious
HERE'S WHERE IT WENT BAD: For the main entree, two of us ordered the veal tenderlions that were supposed to be wrapped in duck proscuitto with fotina cheese
The waiter also boisterously approved with our selections
When the dinner arrived, I thought a practical joke was being played on my friend and I
The plate included 3 tenderlions the size of my thumb with specs of this alleged duck procuitto on top
(keep in mind despite the $25
00 entree, we didn't even receive a house salad)
I ate the meal in probably 5 bites
We were so hungry that we went for a slice of pizza afterwards
I must say that I went to SQC after hearing a radio plug on 102
7 about this Haas promotion and was highly dissapointed
Not only was the dinner bland but the avocados were not even ripe
We were convinced to come in by the hostess on a relaxed Sunday evening- the food was bad and not cheap for what it is
We hated it and thought maybe we had a bad experience but we where at a dinner party last night and that place was mentioned and everyone who had gone there on different days hated it so
Been here a few times

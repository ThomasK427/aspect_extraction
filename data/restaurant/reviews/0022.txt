The drinks were pretty good
I've had better mojitos in the past, but it was good enough to have a second
Overall the food was very good and I'd recommend it if you feel like trying Cuban food
This was the best food and the best ambiance and experience I ever had!
I went to try Calle Ocho because it was presented on The Early Show promoting Mango Mojitos and I thought I'd check it out
Not only do they not serve Mango Mojitos but the staff attitude along with the non existing service make you dont want to go back
So dont waste your time on this place
This is the best food i have ever had! I forget the name of the dish but anyone going here must get the shrimp cooked in molases and rum
If i could choose to eat one food for the rest of my life it would have to be that
I even got to meet the head chef and he was very gracious
The staff is so lovely and friendly and they make you feel like you are the only customer they have
If you are interested in having a really special night or impressing someone this is the place for you!
I ate here once for dinner, and once for brunch, and both times I was very impressed with the quality and uniqueness of the food
I can't recall exactly what I had for dinner, but I recall that the appetizers were outstanding
At a recent brunch, I got the Brioche French Toast, served with a Star Anise/Coconut syrup, that was very good
It was served with the most beautiful fresh fruit salad I've ever had
pineapple, kiwi, guava, and raspberry sorbet
The decor is very colorful and sunny, and they have a really nice looking bar in the front
I find it difficult to not suck down the breads
If I can help myself I save room for empanadas and whatever beef dish looks best
I have been to Casimir many times
Trendy is the one word I would use to describe it
Bar service is always great
Wait service is good and bad
You'lll get your food, but you mightened get a smile! There is usually a good, buzzy atmosphere at night and there has always talent
Nice ambience, good food
It is quite pricey, but the duck dish is worth it
As a treat, it is well worth a try
This restaurant used to be pretty decent
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food
I would not recommend this place to anyone
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there
The food is great and reasonably priced
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people
Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least
Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet
Just an odd group
Anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list
So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it
Casimir is almost always packed, but I've never had to wait more than 15/20 minutes for a table
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in
The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious! I've had oysters, lamb, steak, and duck- all were well-prepared and tender
The specials are usually quite good too
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!)
Definitely underrated! The best steamed mussels you will ever have
This is a nice restaurant with good food
The service is poor during peak hours, but overall it is a place that I will visit again
I recommend any of the duck dishes, but stay away from the escargo
this restaurant serves consistently yummy food, the wines are very good, the ambiance is mellow and sexy, and the service is just fine
the only problem i see is the neighborhood it's in - it's definitely a more upscale place than every other dump on avenue b
perhaps that's why the boors who rated it poorly disliked it - they're expected to behave like civilized humans instead of the vulgar animals spilling out of the dives down the block
I made a reservation for this place in the afternoon specifically for an outdoor table
When we arrived, the guy near the garden(who later said that he was the manager) was horribly rude
First, he didnt even look me in the eye when I asked about our reservation
Then he insisted that they didnt take reservations for the garden
I can understand that type of policy but he was thoroughly unapologetic
He basically insinuated that I was lying about the reservation and shooed us to the bar
Ive been to so many restaurants in New York that are more popular and have never been treated like that
There is no way that I will ever go back
this is an amazing place- i've been going for three years now, and have yet to have a negative experience
i've gone with dates, for birthdays or just to hang out
the ambiance is amazing, the french waiters are extremely cute and charming, the food is great and the prices are to match-plus in the summer the courtyard is wonderful
definitely check it out
One of first things you learn in the restaurant business is not to make fools of your clientle
I went for dinner with group of friends
Had a very nice Vaqueras
Ordered a second bottle of the same wine which turned out to be completely corked
Four astute wine drinking friends confirmed this
However the manager, who refused to come to our table to discuss it, said we were wrong (through the poor waitress) and would not replace our bottle
Not only did he ruin our dinner, but we'll never go back
Wouldn't it have been a better investment to humor us even if we had completely full of it? Listen, I can get steak frite, duck confit, salade au chevre anywhere
it's about details, it's about taking care of your customers
Pretty good food for a neighborhood place
I wouldn't expect it to be as good as it is
Recently I had the salmon while my friend had the halibut and both were really good
Desserts- also good
Nothing groundbreaking but I had no real complaints The atmosphere is pleasant enough, just don't sit near the window if it's very cold outside
You'll freeze
Service is very pleasant, but a little careless
The backup service (runners, bussers, etc
) was great though
Stopped by for an early dinner on Sunday and this place is just about the coziest neighborhood joint around
Everyone seemed to know each other, and added to the warm ambiance
Our order was taken immediately; the food was excellent and served quickly
Most of us ordered their specials and they were definitely special (fresh, yummy, straightforward)
Their mixed drinks weren't so good, but they have nice selection of wines
The prices are very reasonable and if you're looking for a place to become a regular, this one's a smart choice
i went with a party of six was seated almost immediately
we had very good service, delicious filet mignon, a cute friendly bartender, a very good, but inexpensive wine
what more could one ask for! i loved the ambience
it's a hip crowd
i highly recommend it!
Nice atmosphere; it's dark and European
Not too expensive, attractive people

The service is good, the food is good, the atmosphere is just fine
It looks like a dump, but hey, it's all worth the price
While this restaurant/diner is pretty dingy looking and they are severely understaffed, the delicious food, extremely cheap prices (especially for a large sit down restaurant in the village) and 24 hour availability make this place brilliant
My friends and I come here all the time if we ever want an EXCELLENT breakfast or brunch and want to spend the minimal amount of money
You won't be dissappointed unless you're looking for a posh setting, which is this is definitely not
Don't expect good service too for these prices, but you can have a great meal their with friends
now it's only open 24/7 on Friday and Saturday nights
Sigh
Still, this place is a good one
All the food I've ever had here has been pretty good to delicious; really nice variety, especially for a diner
The prices are great for Manhattan
Service is hit or miss; hope for good service but don't expect it
One thing of particular note is the Bass ale on tap; it has always been especially delicious
I don't know why, but it is
Worth going back to again and again
Variety of food to eat
Great fruit crepe very healthy
Its a great place to hang out with friends
When warm weather comes by, sit outside in front of the restaurant
Food isn't bad
if you can spend the time sorting through the diner style menu
Priced well
Waitresses are mixed
I've had one really friendly one and another who couldn't have cared less about being pleasant
Nicely priced drinks and good selection of hot alcoholic blends (like hot cocoa with malibu rum)
Avoid the crepes ;-)
The food is always good no matter what time you get there
saturday brunch or friday night
Great desserts!
The dinner specials at this place truly offer a complete meal for a very reasonable price
For $13 you receive 2 entrees, soup, rice, salad, maki roll, and small dessert
I was very pleased and full when I was finished
All of the dishes are high quality and portions are generously sized
There are many japanese places in the East Village and I've tried many of them
Most J-restaurants in the area specialize in one particular area, such as sushi, ramen, or shabu-shabu
This restaurant stands out for being exceptional for it range and quality of cuisine
This is probably the worst customer service I have ever received
I just moved to the neighborhood and though I would give this place a try
I ordered delivery at 9:15 on a Sat night and was told it would take 15 minutes
An hour later at 10:15, the hostess called to let me know that they wont deliver becuase its raining and if I want my food, I will have to come get it myself
I asked to speak to the manager and she hung up on me! I was so mad and hungry but I ordered from Hiro and got my food in 10 minutes and it was fabulous
With all the competition for Sushi in the E Village--there is no need to eat at Sharaku--EVER!
The sushi is very good, especially salmon and yellowtail
They are much better than Nobu
The jumbo sushi is just way too big for a normal eater
It has the dinner special for $13
75 to $15
75 from 5 pm to 7 pm, best value in town
Kitchen dishes are so-so
The noodle are usually slightly overcooked
The atmosphere is quite good
Service is fine
The seats in the second floor are excellent
This place was very good and the price was just right
We went there with some friends from out of town, who were on a budget and 5 people ate for under 100 bucks
The sushi was good, hot dishes were good, and green tea was excellent
Service was very good
If you want good sushi on a budget, this is the place to go
Other music would have been better
The food here is sooooo very fresh! The service is on the money! And its not pricey
You can definitely enjoy a cozy dinner for two as well as an outing with co-workers
Its a fabulous place! Highly recommended!
Wonderful Japanese sushi bar! Consistently fresh
Traditional and unpretentious
Best fish for the price in NYC
Jumbo sushi just a skosh too big for my palate, but a definite satisfyier
Great Japanese Food, Nice Atmosphere
Def one of my favorite restaurants! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
I ordered miso soup and it was the most unauthentic miso soup ever with cabbage in it
The roll we ordered was big and actually very good
Big enough to be a meal for me
The spicy tuna tartare was delicious
The tempura was also not too bad
I would recommend this place
What previous positive reviews fail to emphasize is how good this retaurant is regardless of price
Yes it is a relatively inexpensive japanese restaurant, but the quality and freshness of the fish is unparalleled
It blows Yama and Iso away and in my opinion is better than many of the very expensive midtown establishments that i've attended
As a bonus the non-sushi dishes are also very, very good
It's not as trendy as the previously mentioned places, both the patrons and the personnel may not be as attractive, but I like the informality of the place, and not that it matters, but i see many Asians eating here
I highly recommend you try this restaurant and judge for yourself, everyone I've taken here has been astounded w/o my prompting
I frequently return to this East Village spot because it is such a good value
The dinner combos including sushi, half portion entree, soup salad and desert is a great value
The sushi rolls are all very good
However, you may want to tell them to ease up on the wasabe
They put more then you may want on nearly every roll, yeowch! The atmosphere is nice, try to get a table upstairs, it is much more quiet and cozy
The dinner combo is really good
For $15
you get miso soup
salad
some appetizers
rice
sashimi or sushi and another hot dish
the sashimi is really fresh
the service is great
But there might be a wait
but it's worth it
Sharaku may not be the most authentic Japanese restaurant, but they have great hours (for when you have sushi craving at any time) and quick, prompt service
In comparison to more expensive sushi places, that skimp on the size of the fish, at Sharaku, you get all that you pay for, and it is great quality
They cater to a more American crowd, which serves them well, their food is good!
Why? It's not authentic

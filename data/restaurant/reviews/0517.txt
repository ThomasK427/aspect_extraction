its the best thai food in nyc, i think, and when people ask me what thai food is like, i always bring them here
better than other places in nyc and westchester!
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves
Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure
My first experience at Siam Square was very pleasant
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall
The menu is great, with a good selection, and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine
Try the brick oven pizza here
it is very good, if you need to go to a good Italian restaurant, this is a place to relax, eat, and enjoy!
It is a very cute place
If you look at the murals in the restaurant, you might notice that it is a bit scary
The waitress that served us was very nice
Try the fruit tart from Italy that they have, it is excellent
i love kennedy's
the chicken ain't that great, they almost never deliver
and you have to order through a pane of bulletproof glass, but the fact of the matter is, after a night of hard drinkin', college style, nothing hits the spot like a big box of inexpensive chicken and fries
all of a sudden they card now, really, josie's, what's goin on man
burgers are good, bartenders funny and entertaining, crazy jukebox, lots of girls
This is one of the best places downtown
I have been going for years and the crowd is very mixed (not just NYU'ers) GO THERE
This bar is mainly an NYU crowd, so there isn't much versatility in the social scene
It's a decent place
Josie Woods is a warm, cozy watering hole
Filled with atmosphere, good food, good beer and great people, you feel right at home
The daily lunch specials can't be beat
Say hi to Trish
She rules
Located on a tree lined block in Turtle Bay next to a Korean nail parlor is one of the most authentic, unpretentious Japanese restaurants in the city
I can't say enough good things about this neighborhood joint
They have a floor to ceiling glass wall facing a pristine Japanese garden in the back (no seating outside) and the best spicy tuna roll in town
It's refreshingly different from all the hip Japanese fusion stand outs in the city
Not cheap, but the food is EXCELLENT
If you are looking for creative rolls, this is not the restaurant for you
Their sushi menu is limited, but the quality of what they do have on the menu is out of this world
Try the toro
it literally melts in your mouth
The thinly sliced marinated beef is delicious and the zaru soba is unique with its many choices of items you can add to the dipping sauce
If you order sake you have to buy a whole bottle
The bottles are small and expensive
This place is amazing
Amazing Tonkatsu, equally amazing Japanese Roast Beef with Ponzu Sauce, the even more amazing sushi
The staff is helpful and always polite
The restaurant is tiny, with a clientel (at least in my experience) being mainly Japanese
The prices, considering what you're getting, are quite good also
I'd eat there at least once a week if I could afford it
After my second visit to this impossibly charming yet peaceful space, it hit me
Seo has served me, on two separate occasions, the best tuna I have ever tasted
The quality and freshness of the fish here cannot be described in a review
In addition to the fare, the tranquil and understated dining area is a perfect compliment to this establishment's sleepy Turtle Bay location
For all you sashimi purists, make an exception and order a spicy tuna roll; instead of mixing the fish with the sauce, Seo serves beautiful pieces of yellowfin lightly covered in an understated yet delicious mix of spices
Along with a deep list of sake, Seo offers creative dishes as sushi alternatives, such as the mouth-watering calamari salad and gorgeous crab dumplings
In front you'll find a very comfortable sushi bar, with many of the fabulous dishes on display
Seo is fantastic
Its that simple
I absolutely love the fact that I can receive a hot pizza w/shrimp and fresh garlic in my neighborhood
the pizza has much pizzazz
I went to this place the other night and the service was sooooo slow and soooo bad and in the end the waitstaff refused to serve us coffee or tea after 10pm (wtf)
With so many other great places in town, why go to one that doesn't appreciate customers
The food was, at best, mediocre and the music was annoying
Not bad, but annoying
The other posting are all phoney
Do yourself a favor, don't go here
This place is awesome
I come here for good, cheap drinks, good sandwich food, and friendly service
Whether I'm alone with my laptop or book, or with a group of friends on a weekday, or week-end night for a pre-party, I always enjoy it
Tip: grab a seat by one of the tables next to the open wall, it feels like you're sitting outside
The couches are cozy
The food is a great value for the price, as are the drinks
Recently added deserts are yummy and go well with their huge selection of coffees
This place is soooo much better than Starbucks next door
As an added bonus, they have live music on one of the weeknights, I think on Mondays (?)
Great hangout!
Do not go to this Cafe
I was harrassed by the management of this establishment
After purchasing a caffe latte for $4
50, I was told to leave because I had not bought anything else
And soley for this reason
I did absoulutely nothing to provoke this
This is not the type of behavior one should get for buying a coffee for $4
50
They were rude and unreasonable
I was apppalled and mortified and feel ripped off
Go next door to Starbucks to get better coffee and respect
This seems to be an on going trend with many smaller business these days
A similar situation happened to a friend of mine at Mickey's Blue Room in the East Village, that place closed a year later
Don't believe the other reviews
You'll get ripped off here and treated like crap
This bar is right by where i live and its great
They are open late and have really good medittereanean/israeli food
Huge cups of coffee and tea
Try the chai with the ice cream
It's absolutely amazing
It's a good place to study until they dim the ligths and the music gets going
Though the service might be a little slow, the waitresses are very friendly
Couches, love seats, and lots of tables are available
It's not very fancy but it has a great atmosphere
I went around 11 at night on a weekend
Music was pretty good

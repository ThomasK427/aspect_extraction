Food also came out fast
Would go there again
High-quality Italian takeout
Best in Murray Hill
Generous portions, speedy delivery
The Scene Sophisticated, rustic Italian decor with an artsy, affluent clientele
A wood-burning oven and inviting fireplace warm the brick and wood interior, while a heated, covered garden attracts diners even on rainy nights
The noise level stays serene, even when packed
The Food This once impressive Apulian pioneer needs a menu makeover
Black chick pea soup is a bland novelty item, and salads and grilled seafood, though fresh, taste better with a shake of salt and pepper
Biggest gaffs come when the kitchen gets creative with scraps
For example, a grilled squid salad gets asparagus buds, but the stems turn up in the tonnarelli, along with unevenly diced raw peppers and mushy zucchini
(Bruised bananas also marred an otherwise luscious mascarpone-filled cookie)
Better dishes include tender orecchiette pasta with veal ragu or tasty, lean roasted rabbit
Servers are efficient and friendly
Thank goodness for restaurant week
I'd wanted to visit here and got the opportunity during restaurant week
Nothing was good here - well, except the fireplace
Service was slow and spotty and the dishes were tasteless
Thank God I didn't spend a lot, cause I would have been VERY upset
Do not go here, unless you're cold and wanted to sit near a fireplace!
I chose the outdoor dining which was nice and the dessert was delicious and THAT WAS IT! the shrimp was old, the pasta wasn't cooked well enough and it took me 10 mins to get a menu and the place was not even busy! don't go unless ur bored to deatH!
We've been here twice now (tonight and in early June 05)
We've had excellent meals both times
We like the prix fixe menu as it is a good deal for $35
Tonight we had the seafood salad and steak over arugula finished with panna cotta
The steak was cooked perfectly
Very tender
I don't know about the other reviewer's octopus
Ours was the best we've had
It literally melts in your mouth
Bartender made very good wine recommendations per usual
Overall a great experience
Typical NY afterwork restaurant with large groups, VERY noisy and cramped
Quite dull decporation
Were recomended the tasting menu by the waiter
First out the Panzerotti wich was average
Then onto the Cavatelli wich was very poor indeed, tasteless and poorly combined flavours
After that an overcoocked Fettuccini (asked for Parmesan cheese and the waiter showed up and shaved Peccorino instead!!!!! wich just destroyed the dish)
Onto the entrees Rabbit (dry and completely absent of any seasoning at all) and an uneatable streamed Octopus (smelled awful, told the waiter and he said what a shame we didnt like it!!!) The chefs here obviously havent been taught what seasoning is!! Well after this endeavour we werent surprised to find a Nutella filled pastry as dessert (Honestly the Nutella was the only REAL italian about this place)
Overall just a VERY poor experience
I went to NYC for the July 4th Weekend and had dinner here
The food in I Trulli is made fresh nothing out of the can
What I ordered was to die for
I had pasta with sausage in a tomatoe sauce
It was to DIE FOR! The wine list is pretty good
Best Pasta I've ever had
I give it FIVE STARS!!!
my boyfriend and i went to i trulli before going to see a show
our reservation was at 6, it was very quiet and we asked to sit outside and it was beautiful
there is a wonderful, laid back atmosphere and the servers were incredibly nice and attentive when needed
we were running a little late and told our waiter and he quickly got us our dessert and check
they were so sweet, the food was good but not typical of what you would think italian would be like
my favorite part of the meal was the caramel dessert with gelato
the entrees were a little bland but still good
i will definitely go back whenever i come back into town!
I'm always suspicious of restaurant week reviews and the reviews on this site explain why
I'm not sure how often these folks eat out, but it's pretty clear that they don't know their calimari from their squid
i Trulli is quite simply an outstanding restaurant
It's food is incredibly fresh, deliberately simple and flavorful and if you're not getting it folks, go back to the Olive Garden
The wine list is absolutely great and the staff are extremely knowledgable and friendly
Ignore the negative reviews here and the editorial review which seems way overly critical of a restaurant that uses the same ingredient in two dishes
I would eat at i Trulli any day of any week
I'm surprised by some of the reviews on this site for this restaurant
Our family had a fantastic vacation last summer in Puglia and i Trulli brought back so many great memories of that trip
Like the food in Puglia, i Trulli's cuisine is quite basic, but they do an incredible job of highlighting the flavors of the food and balancing them against each other with great skill
I don't know whether the other reviewers on this site are used to Northern Italian cuisine, but I can guarantee that i Trulli is an extremely authentic representation of the simple, rustic fair that you can enjoy in Puglia
We'll certianly be back to enjoy the food, wine and memories of Puglia
It's so easy to screw up Italian, but I Trulli thankfully gets it just right
Their pasta is freshly homemade, perfectly cooked, and presented rather plainly -- which is fine
The food stands out even without any grand efforts to make it look good
It may have been the best Italian meal I've had in the city -- our servers weren't pretentious, the outdoor garden is beautiful (though it can get uncomfortably warm), and everyone's meal was solid
I went to I Trulli during Summer Restaurant eek
The restaurant had nice service and cozy atmosphere
But I was unimpressed with the menu and food
Desserts were uneventful
Price was okay
Overall it was an average experience
Do not get the calzone appetizers
Its not worth if for you buck, you mind as well eat a lean pocket at home
The Rabbit ragu was not as flavorful as I had hoped
The Panna Cotta is a MUST eat
The BF's rabbit meat dish was mediocre
I would not even recommend this restaurant for first comers
I had the restaurant week menu and was very happy with it
Grilled octopus appetizers was one of the best I've had - and I love octopus
Service was attentive and I never felt like a second class citizen for ordering from the fixed menu
Sorbet could have been better, but otherwise really nice a good restaurant week value
Try to sit outdoors, its lovely!
Service was slow and indifferent, and nothing you expect at this level of restaurant (e
g
, no wine list was offered, cheese was not offered with the pasta)
One entree was not what was ordered - although the correct item was on the bill - and the other one was cold, rubbery, and disgusting
Waiter was nowhere to be found
Manager's attitude, was well, that's what happens during resturant week
At these prices, it should have been better
The food here was absolutely delicious
Try the ravioli stuffed with veal and spinach in Sicilian Pistachio sauce, it was great, as well as the fresh sorbet, the best I've ever had
I Trulli has one of the most extensive wine lists in the city, and you'll find its owner, Nicola Marzovilla, to be a friendly and knowledgeable man
If it were a bit cheaper, I'd be coming here regularly

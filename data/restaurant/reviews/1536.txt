However, good to arrive on off-peak hours since it does get crazy!
Overpriced and underwhelming food, in portion size and taste
Poor to non-existent service
My first and last time I will be dining there
Just loved KumGangSan!! To avoid the crowd, we arrived about 5 pm, which was a perfect time
We were greeted and seated upstairs
Our waitress, was extremely, pleasant and asked if we would like some help in planning our dinner
We choose the barbecue beef and seafood combination
which was Excellent
They start you out with about 8 different dishes of appetizers, which is included with your meal
We also decided to try a soup and rice dish, portions are large and can be shared
Try something different, you will be glad you did, as the food is really wonderful
Planning our second trip back soon!!
The food was plentiful and decently priced, the service was quite excellent, the restaurant was spacious, and I loved how they had live entertainment (woman stringing several instruments)
One thing that is a bit annoying is how there is a semi-thick cloud of somke coming from all tables doing Korean BBQ, you may very well end up reeking of the BBQ even if you had never lit up at all
I will definitely be coming back here again, great place for a date!
Kum Gan San is famous for having really great food, ambience and the greatest Korean BBQ ever! It is huge in size with a beautiful waterfall at the entrance
Sometimes, there is a woman perched on the waterfall playing the flute
Welcome to the world of fine dining
Food is abundant
You get about 10 tiny appetizers with each meal
Portions are meant to be shared family style
Food is excellent
Service is great but, the bill tends to run high at the end of the night, especially if you've had drinks with your meal
Overall, a fantastic place to try some quality Korean food
You may not be served quickly, and the wait staff can't be called overly friendly however this is a must have New York experience
This is quality Seoul food and it's open 24/7
They have a decent selection of soju and sake
The kimchee is excellent
My personal favorite here is the dak bul gui, however the sizzling rice bowls are enticing as well and if you're into noodles try the Jap che
Don't be intimidated by the menu
Choose something that has ingredients you enjoy and don't worry about being properly satiated or satisfied
This is a great date dinning experience, not for the atmoshpere but for the adventure and food
we ate at the Flushing, ny location
prices were high for some items
kalbi beef is done pretty well though portions are small
complimentary appetizers and fruit are provided
cocktails are not that great
service can be slow when the place is crowded
The food is average, and the service is definitely better for native Korean speakers
If you want a view of the waterfall and piano, get a seat upstairs
But ohnestly, it's not THAT great
You sort of forget it's there after a while
Good point: the banchan or the side dishes are great
You get a whole lo of them, and they are all varied and made quite well
I don't see this as a romantic place
it's more of a place to go with your long-term significant other late at night when you crave some Korean food
Or, to take your family
This is a great place for people who have never eaten Korean food and want the experience or for someone who loves Korean food and knows what the deal is
The food is a little expensive and I would avoide the sushi
When I look at the menu I was surprised at the relatively high price compared with other korean restaurants
I thought the food was going to be good but it wasnt
We ordered a seafood and pork bbq but the pork was done at the kitchen instead of at the table
The pork tasted just like chinese roasted pork at chinatown (which only costs under $10 for a pound) and the serving was very little but it costs more than $20
The seafood bbq only contains one shrimp, one mushroom, one oyster, and a bunch of vegetables, and it costs more than $40
The whole dinner costs $100 for 2 ppl
I think it is really not worth it
There are better korean restaurants with better food and cheaper prices
when this restaurant first opened in Flushing Queens, it was definitely the place to go to but the chef moved to Manhattan and the Queens location wasn't as great
The Manhattan location seems to be following because the food isn't nearly as great as the other places
I would say that it is only acceptable
If you do go, take advantage of the gahrl-bee bento lunch special
That's the only thing worth getting at this restaurant until they get skimpy on the meat
Four old Peace Corps buddies who served in Korea (South); one from AZ, one from PA, one from NC and me, from NYC; were looking for a decent Korean restaurant for a nice lunch
This place was great
The service was good, they tollerated our bad Korean language, served a decent pan-chan and a very good Bul-Go-Gi! All four of us, who served two years in rural Korea to all enjoy a space, that's good stuff! BTW, one of the members was married to a Korean, had children with a Korean, and wanted to get a doggie bag to take home to the kids!  I recommend it!
Curious about Korean food, we walked into this spacious, well-decorated restaurant
While I picked a fairly safe dish, my companion selected something the waitress noted Americans usually don't order, and soon found out why
Service was fairly attentive and a plethora of sides (unannounced) made up for the slightly outlandish prices
I recoomend going with barbecue, as this is the specialty (something I should have done)
ive gone to this restaurant on a number of occassions, and while i think the food is generally consistent, i was appalled at the sometimes rude service and even ruder manager
while this was just one occassion, it has kept me from returning to this restaurant
overall however, the service is pretty quick, and you cant go wrong with the food
I went to the restaurant with my girlfriend and her family
I did expect a good everning because the one in Queens is good
Sadly, it isn't
The price are same, but the portion is for cats
There were five people, and none of us feels had anything his stomach
We got a bill which is over $150 dollars and a bad night
Whenever my friends and I are trying to decide where to eat in Korea Town, we consistently pick Kum Gang San because it has something for everyone
Great place to get Korean BBQ
The Kalbi Tang (beef short ribs in broth) and Neng Myun (cold buckwheat noodles in soup) are my favorites here
This place has very good food, but was a bit pricey, for two people the total was over $75
I reccomend the Plum Wine, very tasty and goes excellent with the food
The complimentary appetizers were very good, though I'm still trying to figure out if one of them was snail or not LOL The table BBQ was fun, especially for two aspiring chefs
Great place to try something new!
Went here the other night with my sister for dinner
If you skip the Bimi Bop rice, which is delicious, and choose the meats, the condiments and the lettuce, you have yourself once hell of an Atkins meal
Plus you get to grill your own meat
Fun fun
But keep in mind you will walk out smelling like a BBQ pit and the prices can get steep
I prefer the short ribs and ribeye
The kimchee is also yummy! If you ever find yourself in the 30's West, I say give it a try
Even though the Kum Gang San in Flushing is better, the restaurant in NYC is still consistantly tasty and better than a lot of other places
The ban-chan (appetizers) are some of the best and the place is always packed with people
Best of all, it's open 24 hours a day!!
Had dinner here with two friends recently
Pleasant setting with live piano and cello music
The place is a bit kitschy but very nice inside
Extremely attentive service and FANTASTIC food! The korean chirashi was great, as was the BBQ we had

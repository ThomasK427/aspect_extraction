Don't forget to try some of their Thai Iced Tea and fried banana with whipped cream
The Mai Tais and Pina Coladas are tasty too! This restaurant is also dining alone friendly
Intimate setting but there is an area for larger groups
Very average, but also pretty cheap, so I guess the value might be a match


almost worth the good view looking down on 7th Ave, but not quite
Spring roll did not taste very fresh, soup ok but only had 2 shrimps
Might be a better take-out
I go to this restaurant quite frequently and they serve delicous and satisfying food
I recommend going there if your willing to walk up a couple blocks from the Q train or the F train
If youre not willing, order a delivery instead
The Pad See Eiw is awesome
They serve the most original and classic Thai food around here and it comes at an inexpensive price also
How better can it get? Everybody just go there, you'll be happy when you leave
How can you beat an environment that throws you back to the glory years of New York Italian cooking while giving a glimpse into the Pop America of the 40s, 50s, and 60s
The seafood appetizers are particularly amazing
The cold meats couldn't be fresher
It's a steal even for Brooklyn
In fact, you'll feel a million bucks richer when you leave
My husband loves old-school Italian restaurants, I decided to take him to Monte's for his birthday
When we first walked in, I was a little taken back by the ambiance
smelly old carpet and booths in need of re-covering made me a little nervous
We choose our courses from the tattered old menus and then the food started coming
First were the baked clams
They were by far the best we had ever tasted
The pasta fagiole soup -- fantastic! The house red was the perfect match for all the dishes we sampled
I could go on about the magnificent food, but then I wouldn't have room to tell you about the cheesecake!!! We were too full so they gave us a piece to take with us -- on the house! It was honestly some of the BEST cheesecake ever!!!
The Scene Since 1999, locals have quietly coveted this friendly trattoria, charmed by its casual, candlelit elegance and superb Northern Italian cooking
Now, an all-borough crowd crams the communal tables, sharing reverential sighs under a gigantic glass chandelier that dominates the small room
Venetian-born Emiliano Coppa is the quintessential host: He welcomes guests, busses tables and describes his wife's daily-changing menu
The Food  Chef Anna Klinger cooks the food of the Veneto, a region flavored by Venice and the countryside that surrounds it
Start with fennel-fragrant grilled sardines and the extraordinary pastas, such as poppy-seeded sweet beet ravioli, brown-butter-slicked squash tortelli, and airy swiss chard-ricotta "malfatti" (misshapen gnocchi with fried sage)
Days later, you'll dream about luscious polenta beneath braised rabbit with thyme and olive gravy, tender calves' liver slivered over sweet and sour onions, meaty monkfish with lemon-rosemary escarole and sublime chocolate pear tart
i've read so much about this place, i expected to be utterly blown away by the food
maybe we ordered the wrong items because the food was not spectacular, with the exception of the poppy-seeded sweet beet ravioli appetizer
this dish IS amazing and i would have loved to have it be a main dish
the grain salad was ok, the calf liver was stringy and the roast onions that came with it too heavy
my boyfriend's fish was overwhelmed by the sauce
and we did have to wait for at least half an hour to get a table
also, the interior is VERY loud, you have to almost shout to be heard by the person in front of you and end up hearing everyone else's conversations
not a romantic restaurant by any stretch
our waiter WAS wonderful and very helpful w/ the wine selection
i would try this place again but with lowered expectations
Service is excellent
ALL of the staff make you feel so welcome
I waited over 45 mins for my friend and never felt uncomfortable
As for the food FANTASTIC
My guest said the ribs was the best she ever had
My fish was delightful
Great Restaurant
Junie
I go here whenever take out or my own cooking doesnt cut it
The food is hearty and worth the cost
The wait is a little long, but once seated there is nothing you have to worry about except eating too much
Great food that leaves you satisfied
What more could you ask for?
Absolutely lives up to the hype
I went here with high expectaions and they were met and surpassed
The service and food was wonderful
Arrive early to avoid the crowds; we got there not long after 6 on a Thursday and were seated right away
Finally in Park Slope, a place to eat that is actually a very fine restaurant
If you cant handle the wait, go to McDonalds
If you like complaining about the cost, go to Plains, Georgia, or Hope, Arkansas
If you want great Italian food, fairly price, good service, in Brooklyn, a couple of subway stops from Union Square,(where you should complain about the prices) go to Al Di La
We went ot Al di La a bit earlier than we usually go to dinner, mainly due to the fact that reservations are not accepted
We still ended up spending a good hour in the wine bar next door, but it was completely tolerable, and actually a very nice way to start the night
The food was very good, the appetizers worth sampling, and the specials were great too
I would definitely go back
Its a great place to bring a friend or date if you want to impress
Just go
We usually hope that there is a wait so we can sit at the bar in back and have a glass of wine with an appetizer
Great service, knowledgeable staff, delicious food at a great value
Glad I got the good stuff, seems others weren't so lucky
Did have to wait, but it was quite bearable at wine bar next door; they even had perseco
Tagliatelle with meat ragu was delicious, I'd go back just for that
Similar to, but maybe a little better, than Il Bagato in East Village
Looking forward to trying it again
Yes, the hour wait was a bummer in the pretty crowded bar around the corner
But the place was worth it--delicious food (I got rabbit for the first time) and wonderful wine --I took the waitresses suggestion and couldn't be more pleased
Service was attentive but not overbearing
I plan to go back for the desserts!
Strictly an average neighborhood place
The Times has lost its mind; shouldn't even review the restaurant, much less give it two stars
Bacala had the texture and taste of whitefish salad; the famous tripe was disappointing, about as oily and chewy as ever (and we left plenty of the famous sauce in the bowl, uneaten); pastas was fine (beet ravioli is quite nice, bolognese ragu is poor at best); liver was praised by the Times and was no better than anything we can all do at home; steak had so much balsamic sauce, you had to eat around it
If you live there, go; if not, stay closer to home, definitely not worth the trip
Oh, and the wine is ridiculously overpriced
when the wine is the best thing at dinner, its not a good thing
polenta with cod was literally unedible
the saltimbocca a roman dish (strange for venetian kitchen anyway) was bastardized using pork not veal and turned out very bland, ok at best
i started out with the tauted malfatti were bland too
anyway ill try it again maybe it was an anomoly?!?
This place is overrated
I had a very good carpaccio and a good salad
Don't know why that day they had so many pork dishes (some were specials)
Ended up trying the one on the menu and it was tasteless it was kind of like pork parmessiana, not good
Everything else is o
k
Place is a little small for me
Service was good

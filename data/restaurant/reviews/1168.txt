The staff here are all courteous and professional
For a more casual night, order from the extensive menu in the front bar
From the moment you walk through the awesome front doors you step into another time
Silverleaf is one of the most origianl places I have been to on the restaurant scene
I love that it tries not to be so sleek and empty like most of the newer restaurants popping up all over Manhattan
The food matches the decor so elegantly
Try the frenchtoast and truffels
Amazing! Next time your there check out the paintings I think they are the four food groups painted as still life! now thats original!
Two of us went for a fairly late meal (around 10:30) on a Friday night
There were a few parties in the dining room, but it was starting to clear out
Service was impeccable
Friendly, knowledgeable, and not at all overbearing
The room is also very cool, decorated primarily in silver, blue, and black
The food was excellent
Even the bread basket was remarkable, accompanied by a ricotta and garlic spread and a white bean and yellow beet salad in addition to whipped butter
I recommend the goat cheese French toast to start
The mushrooms accompanying this dish were sublime
The hangar steak was good -- tender and flavorful -- although I found the short rib knish to be bland
The venison was very tasty, accompanied by crispy, highly-flavorful spaetzle and maple glazed carrots
A very well balanced dish
I would highly recommend Silverleaf, and will not hesitate to return
I do pride myself on being a foodie
I love trying different restaurants and new flavors
That being said
ANYTHING made with truffle I flip for and this time is no exception
This place has a goat cheese stuffed french toast over mushrooms and dressed with a black truffle fondue
I liked it so much, I asked the bartender if I could lick the plate (and you will too)
Loved the shellfish panroast and the hangar steak is great witht the NY style knish
While the deocr in the dining room is less than inviting, I recommend eating at the bar where there is full menu service
The staff is attentive and friendly and I think I finally found a place where the staff doesn't loathe serving you
VERY refreshing
This restaurant is not yet well known, but it will get there once the word gets out
The food is beyond superb
The waiters wowed me with their eloquence
A wonderful dining experience
The bottomless wine option, athough, for $48 is a gimmick, and quite expensive
Next time I'll just order by the bottle--drink more, spend less
Otherwise, I will be back there again for the food and dining experience
The service was extraordinary from our greeting at the door until the time we left
The food is creative, and the wine list is very cleaver
We thoroughly enjoyed every moment and will be back again
In fact we just made another reservation
4 of us had a really terrific meal
The calamari, goat cheese fondue and yellowtail sashimi all excellent
Entrees of duck, halibut and shellfish pan roast all very good
We had two desserts - a chocolate cake and a trio of sorbets, also very good
Disappointed with over the top decor
Service excellent
I had steak for two a week ago
It was very good
The steak was juicy and fresh
I love it
I brought my girlfriend to Tempo expecting to have a nice neighborhood meal - the result was a wonderful NYC dinning experience
I can say enough about this restaurant! It has a modern yet warm dcor with Manhattan feel
There's an extensive wine list with very reasonably priced options
The clam appetizer was the highlight of the meal, though the lamb chop and shrimp entree were also excellent
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone
The Food was really some of the best I've had in the city
The setting was modern interesting without being stuffy
Despite being a restaurant that attracted foodies, the prices were reasonable especially given the high quality dishes creative menu
Would recommend the Goat Cheese salad the Fregola w/ Shrimp-light fabulous
The Clam appetizer did win votes as the best dish
Left Manhattan to venture to Park Slope due to gift certificate
What a find! Decor is warm, interesting artwork, flowers
Bar has a wall of wine bottles behind it (options in the $30 range)
FOOD: Looked and tasted delicious! i'm a foodie and everything was fantastic
Starters of arugula with roasted baby beets and shaved feta on top, and mussel/curry soup with rizettes and a drizzle of some flavored oil
Mains were black seabass on top of pureed fava beans and an almond-date coulis
AMAZING! double cut pork chop with savory stuffing and dried fruit confit - yum
But the BEST THING: brooklyn blackout cake
I wish i had known and eaten that first
Fluffy moist with chocolate pudding in between the layers
simply orgasmic if you're a chocolate lover
Service: attentive, knowledgeable, fun (not stuffy)
I would go back there in a heartbeat - even to Brooklyn!
Our food was late (60 minutes,) we called our waitress, she ignored us, and we had to ask the busboy to call her
One dish (of three) arrived cold, and 10 minutes before the other two
After complaining we were offered glasses of wine of the wine we were drinking
But were given a different, and terrible, wine
They removed our plates, without asking, before we were done eating; one of us actually had his fork in his mouth when the plate underneath him disappeared
They present a pose of a high class' restaurant, but once they had do deal with human errors they lost it and had no idea what they are doing
It is sad, the food, if warm enough, could have been good, but alas ones taste buds are not as forgiving when the situation is unpleasant, tense, and frustrating
I suggest avoiding the place
Friendly, highly professional service, fantastic food, clean and comfortable and beautiful interior, and great drinks
I love the skate! Skate is the trendy fish to fry lately, and Tempo's preparation is best, hands down
Flavorful food, nothing is bland here
What's not to like? I expected the service to be a bit stuffy, based on the lovely, warm and elegant decor, but not at all
The host was very friendly, and made attemtps to seat us early
The wait staff was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious (goat cheese salad
mmmm) Would love to go back
This restaurant: fabulous
My wife and I eat out a lot, and this is the finest restaurant in park slope
I'm normally favor dining values, but if you want to celebrate and are willing to spend $45-60 a person for an unmatched three-course meal (estimate includes tax and tip), this is the best restaurant in park slope
We had a mixed greens salad (I don't know HOW they made leafy stuff taste so good), the ribeye for two (again, fantastic), and a dessert (I forget which, because I love all things buttery and sweet)
A sommellier recommended a great wine and we had the best possible dining experience (though, we certainly compensated them well for it!)
Modern, elegant decor matches the menu
Tons of space inside
5-star service throughout
This is just classy
I went here with my family and we were VERY happy - meets/exceeds many restaurants that are far pricier

We went to go see Ute Lemper
During the first 15 minutes of the performance, the sound system gave horrible feedback
It was so bad, at one point she said, Should I keep going? Paying $75 each just for the show, I expected the hotel to have a working and high end sound system
I naively thought dinner was served during the show, but the waiters don't come by once the shows start, so order your wine 30 mins before the show start time
The captain will expect a tip on your tab
Also, the Evian they put on your table is $10
I think it's a great experience, but the sofas weren't that comfortable, and I would've been mad if Ute wasn't so great
I would go during a weekday when it's not so crowded and you have the place to yourselves
Also, it's $10pp cheaper on a weeknight
Has the character, has Woody Allen every Monday
why would they care for more
The ambience is super! It was a pricey night but i can't even describe the retro magical feelings
a night to remember for sure
Cool and swing!
We went there to see Ute Lemper and she was fantastic
The venue is great
The people were nice and we had a great table
The food is bad and expensive
$15 for appetizer, $40 for main dish, no choice of tap water
You can either have sparkling or still for $10/bottle
My lamp was way too salty and my wife's porcini crusted chicken had not a hint of porcini
I would recommend going for the show and drinks, but not dinner
We treated ourselves to see Woody Allen play with his jazz band (mondays; $75 cover)
We didn't want to dine there, but our concierge said that it was standing room only without dinner reservations, and she was correct
We had a very good meal, nothing too ambitious
You can't go wrong with smoked salmon and an excellent new york strip sirloin, perfectly done and served with a too-seldom seen bearnaise sauce
Not a good selection of wine for less than $50
Real professional service
Expensive, but worth it!
The Scene Pastel walls decorated with folk art and glass shelves lined with silverware create a tastefully festive atmosphere
The dining room feels intimate but is actually quite large--nooks and crannies are dotted about everywhere
Service is variable: sometimes excellent, sometimes merely adequate
The Food Richard Sandoval creates haute takes on familiar standbys, and invents a few of his own creamy confections, too
In the former category, quesadillas stuffed with cheese and zucchini blossom are soft and crunchy, while mole poblano features unusually complex sauce and boneless chicken tenders spiralled around plantains
In the latter, baked oysters swamped with goat cheese, habaneros and crispy bacon are a gooey treat and perfectly seared scallops chime with halibut, lemon, chiptole, avocado and cilantro to wonderfully tangy effect
Off notes--like tuna seviche overwhelmed by a citrus juice--are few and far between
not the best Mexican I have had and very noisy
The Tuna entree was delicious but the appetizes were just ok
Its a little far away so I would not go back
The drinks were good but the food definetly too pricy for what it really is
Would rather go back to Rosa mexicana
I went on a weeknight around 10pm
Ok, you could say this place is cozy with tables around corners and nooks but it is also exceptionally loud
Don't go there on a first date and expect to have a meaningful conversation! That said, the food is very nicely prepared
Portions are large and (too) satisfying
My server was very good
She asked if we wanted some guacamole - mild, medium or hot, to start
Sure, hot
A large portion arrived and it didn't seem at all hot so I asked for some hot sauce
Their homemade hot sauce is excellent! I usually like to ask what they recommend or what the house signatures are
After gorging on the homemade guacamole and chips and this being my first visit, I opted to try the appetizer sampler (seafood poblano, veggie quesadilla cornmeal covered chicken)
It was really delicious and filling
Almost a perfect meal
Unfortunately, all of this good food and noise doesn't happen cheaply
Be prepared to spend, especially if you drink
I would certainly go back, but sparingly
If you a looking for a cozy mexican place to have a date or family night Maya is where you got to go
They also have a great bar to get some drinks - the fresh fruit margaritas and mojitos are amazing!  The food was extraordinary, all flavors reminded me of my childhood in Mexico; presentations are something I have never expected to see in Mexican cooking, kind of elegant
The flavors are very well balanced - not too spicy no too cuminy - just right! PLEASE order the queso fundido - it is a delight! and NEVER ever live the place without ordering the TRES LECHES for dessert, I've never tasted anything like that - wanna have it every day!!!
If you are looking for a good Mexican in the UES this is the place to go
The food is not pretentious, if you have been to Mexico, you will know what I'm talking about
It is full of flavor, chiles are used in many different ways and there is a variety of choices on the menu, from pork, lobster and shrimp to vegetarian entrees
The margaritas are awsome ( easily addictive ) , the tequila selection is one of the best in the city
The space ( I was told ) was just redesigned, it is simple, cozy and has a great mexican feeling
I don't recommend you go with kids, but I recommend it for an after work drink
I've walked past this little place many times, and finally went after work for a drink or town with friends
While the drinks were delicious, they were definitely over-priced
For an appetizer, he recommended a sampler platter that wasn't listed on the menu - but he said it included three appetizers that he pointed out for me
I ordered, I ate, I choked when I saw that this plato pequeno cost a whopping $38 - which is a lot for a girl on a budget! I have never in my life paid that much for an appetizer, I can't imagine what it is like to have a full meal there
All in all, I think this restaurant is trying to milk its hype as an authentic Mexican restaurant - while you can get a much better meal at one of the other hundreds of places in the city
I had passed by Maya a thousand times, being that I live in the area
I met some friends for drinks
I found Maya had an amazing selection of Tequilas
The margaritas are top notch
We had some appetizers at the bar
I highly reccomend the seared tuna and the Chile relleno
Ive been back to the bar a couple of times since then, cant wait to sit down and dine
Since having a drink at Maya a few years ago I had always wanted to eat here and so I made a reservation through this website
This is definitely recommended for a Friday night as the place was hopping at 8
15pm and we started on a drink at the bar before our table was ready
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed
The food was good, but nothing exceptional
The drinks were the high point, a strawberry margharita was delish and the tequila I ordered came with a spicy tomato juice chaser which was intriguing
Good for people watching, fun with a crowd, but much better if you're not paying!
When I arrived with my friend, we were told we'd have to wait 10-20 minutes
An hour later, we were still standing (or, rather, getting bulldozed by customers and waiters in the waiting area) while EVERYONE we'd arrived with had been seated already
The hostesses LIED multiple times when we inquired about the wait, promising you're next only to call multiple parties before us
They were rude, condescending, and unapologetic - never once did we receive even an insincere sorry for your wait
When we finally were seated at our cramped table, we practically had to read each other's lips it was so loud
When the bill arrived, I almost fell out of my chair when we each owed over $70 and did not order appetizers or desert
Bottom line - Nobody cares how good your guacamole is when your employees can't be bothered to treat customers with respect
Richard Sandoval's cuisine is outstanding! Excellent ceviche + quesadillas
Al seafood dishes are exceptional, with lots of kick
Happy hour drinks + appetizers are a bargain
Maya has a great choice of drinks and unforgeable food
The best thing for the apps is the chili relleno
Other than that, the ceviche and the quesadillas is very good!!!!!!!!!! Lobster and shrimp is my favorite dish and I hope they will bring back the pipian de puerco
Maya is no hidden gem of value, but if you're looking for a delicious Mexican meal, an attentive but not intrusive waitstaff, and a delightful atmosphere - you'll find it here
I thought I'd hate this place after reading all of the neg

brash, proud and hysterically funny
There are several fine piano players
But one, is the reason most people return
MR
BLUE one of the finest talents in the WORLD
He is a gem who can sing, play, tell jokes, wear costumes and IS a man of spiritual powers
There is NO COVER CHARGE
Two words- THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
Having lived in the area I have visited Mimi's many a time and find this place to be very unique
It's like a time warp when you step in and is truly the best people watching you'll ever see
You get a chance to drink, sing, and laugh your ass off at the absurdity, while enjoying some good Italian food
I highly recommend the pork chops and cherry peppers with fettuccine alfredo, the rigatoni bolognese, or chicken picatta
You can't take the service too seriously, many of the servers have a giant chip on their shoulder but it in my opinion adds to this crazy place
In all, go to mimi's if you're expecting someplace that's fun and different, not if you're expecting a queit romantic evening
Go have fun, get drunk and join in with the piano player, if you're lucky he may even give you a palm reading!
Mimi's has, by far, the worst service I've ever encountered at a restaurant anywhere in the world
It's not just that the service is bad - the waitresses, hostess, and bartenders are simply rude
It's almost as if they go out of their way to treat you as poorly as possible
I don't understand how they run a business like this - it would make more sense if the food were fantastic, but the food is average, for an average price
I wouldn't put up with service like this for the best food in the world, much less the mediocrity that is Mimi's
WE loved this place
We walk by occassionally and decided to try Mimi's for dinner one night
The food is great, not fancy but real and satisfying
There is a piano and the waitresses and customers sing
We had a fantastic time and highly reccomend the place to family and friens
Soon to be regulars
I arrived from Los Angeles for a weekend in New York
The concierge at The Marriot recommended that we experience a local restaurant called Mimi's
What a find!!! What Flavor
The food was exquisite, the ambience, beyond real!!! This is New York!!! This quaint, local, last of the real Piano Bars was a real treat
This is New York character at it's finest
I've been to Mimi's over a dozen times, so I've gotten to know this restaurant pretty well
I love dining there during the wintertime because the decor is just so perfect and cozy
I've always received good customer service, and the manager is extremely nice
The waitresses aren't the best, one is an airhead and the other is a bit abnoxious, but they're decent and we've never had any major problems
The food is really nothing to rant and rave about
Their chicken is always rubbery
Their pasta is so-so
It's decent food, but don't come expecting anything spectacular
My favorite is their house salad with the house dressing
I will return to Mimi's, but not for their food - for the feel
It's so cozy, it makes me feel so warm when I sit there sipping on a capuccino on a cold winter night
My friends and I make it a point to go to Mimi's each time we visit the City, their tortellini alfredo is delicious
The service has always been sub-par, but the last time we were there it was absolutely terrible
The waitress/manager was as rude and unaccommodating as ever, plus the bartender rudely told our friends to get off her bar while they were trying to enjoy an after dinner smoke
We mentioned the incident to the waitress/manager, who not only didn't seem to care that our friends had been harassed, but also made sure to point out that she had nothing to do with it, and the incident shouldn't affect her tip
Then the bartender had the nerve to cuss us out from across the restaurant as we were leaving
Needless to say, I will not be returning to or recommending Mimi's
I come back to NY about 3 times a year and have always made it a point to visit Mimi's cause it's right down the street and I love their tortelini alfredo
The service was always bad, but this weekend was simply ridiculous
We were griped at for making reservations and barked at for not having all 5 people arrive at once
During dinner, as some friends went to the bar for a smoke, the bartender told them You're at a smoking table so GET OFF MY BAR
We told the waitress about it and she said it wasn't her problem
Due to this and other rude service, we reduced our normal 20% tip to 12% on our $200 tab
As we walked out, the waitress and bartender screamed obscenities at us
Our night was ruined the moment we walked into Mimi's as the sour-faced manageress walked us to our seats
We stopped at a table behind the one she had picked out for us and asked if we could sit there instead
In response, she rolled her eyes and walked off, throwing down the menus she had initially picked out for us, four tables away
We were confused by her tantrum and looked around for some explanation as to why she had stormed off
After a few minutes, seeing we were without menus, a slightly more pleasant waitress approached us and explained that the manageress had asthma and wasn't in a good mood
As the food was so average, it didn't matter that the service had spoilt our appetites, because we didn't want to eat the food anyway
This is a quaint and interesting place
A friend of mine had extended an invitation, and I am glad I went
Not only was service timely, the food was refreshing and terrific!!
the food is great, fast but upscale
prices are very reasonable
the location is great, in the heart of manhattan shopping district
the staff makes you feel that you are home
ravioli porcini, and salads are recomended especially
There is an annex on 45th Street off Third on the east side
It is so wonderful there
The manager goes out of his way to see every patron is happy
The food is the best
Whether you order a pizza or crab ravioli it is fresh-perfectly seasoned and beautifully
The desserts are out of this world-the anise biscuits are made with butter and are to die for
A medium priced restaurant with extravagant food
Mix of an irish pub/sports bar with a nice dining area with well-placed flat screens
Crabcake appetizer was fabulous topped with their spectacular homemade tartar sauce
We follwed that up with more seafood -- scallop special and the traditional fish and chips -- loved them both
Service was great, but the crowd was mixed
Amazing that just a few steps above the 6th floor of Bloomingdale's is this quiet little restaurant
It's a great place to go when you are spending the day shopping on the Upper East Side
A true New York City Experience
It's no five star restaurant, but it is good for a nice lunch
The dining room is quaint, staff friendly, and views are great
Food is totally fine, nothing to rave about, but good
It's a nice place to meet a friend for lunch, and because it is inside Bloomingdales, it is convenient as well
The Pita Grill has something for everyone, a great take-out, order in or eat-in, from falafels to kebabs, salads to the best hummus and cucumber dip
very healthy eating as well! and affordable too!
My friends and I discovered Blockheads early this year when our office moved to the neighborhood
Since then, we've made sure we return at least once a week for a fabulous lunch of some of the biggest and best-tasting burritos that I have yet to experience in this city
The lunch specials are very well priced ($8 to $12) and include chips salsa and a drink, along with the gigantic meal
Service is professional, prompt, and friendly
Steaks and other muscular American foods stand their ground in this throwback to a grand style
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene This is a power-dining scene, with aggressively present staff, smooth, streamlined operation and a crowd that means business
The dining room is spacious and decorated with an abundance of Americana bordering on the ludicrous: folk-art bald eagles, Stars-and-Stripes neckties, a miniature flagpole on each table
The Food The menu includes both classic steaks and slightly more modern dishes
The headline entree is the crackling pork shank, a two-pound piece of unnaturally tender meat with a crisp, deep-fried skin
The rib steak is big, crusty and flavorful, and rare filet mignon is soft and juicy
Seafood entrees, such as an order of large seared sea scallops, can be a little lacking in flavor

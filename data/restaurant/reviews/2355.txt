Fun place
It gets a bit crowded but the bartenders are friendly, women are good looking and you've got a good chance at a buy-back every three rounds - overall a fun place to hang out and tie a load on
like the atmosphere of the upstairs bar
high ceilings, fireplace, spacious rooms, cozy couches and nooks
friendly bartenders
just a MAJOR disappointment in the attitudes of the bouncers at the door
there is no need to give attitude to the group who is holding a private party in the upstairs room - we are bringing you business! overall an ok place
GO UPSTAIRS!!! The 2nd floor bar/lounge with 3rd floor catwalk lounge is easily the most impressive space one can find along the East Side 2nd Ave strip
There is a long bar area wide enough to accommodate large crowds, large screen tv's on the walls to view games, but not that do not dominate the atmosphere, and up front there is a large lounge are with several booths and a working fireplace
This is a great spot for drinking, dancing, and hooking-up
The dj booth is perched high above the lounge and the brick walls accentuated with proper mood lighting and artwork, work with the extremely high ceilings to create a very spacious atmosphere for the 20 something clientele
(guys must be over 23
that's a plus!!!)
The Scene A fiercely loyal clientele of stylish urban professionals takes to the small, dark-wooded front bar after work to sip cocktails
Most eventually sneak back to the large dining room for a meal, where an army of pampering servers tends to each linen-draped table
Lined with heavily upholstered banquettes, white brick walls and oversized faux-floral arrangements, it's timelessly elegant, if a bit timeworn
The Food The lengthy, upscale menu features Italy's greatest hits
From the north, there's risotto studded with sweet shrimp, slicked with ultra-rich tomato cream
From the south, a mild slab of fried buffalo-milk ricotta with lemon-dressed arugula
Homemade pastas are boldly seasoned: Flat, chewy malfatti (misshapen pasta) tangled with piquant caper-artichoke is a good bet
Entrees range from hearty pine nut-spinach braciole stewed in spicy tomato sauce to simple grilled fish, de-boned tableside
This is a somewhat spacious Italian Restaurant
It's a nice place, the only problem is that it gets very loud when it's crowded making it difficult to hear
The service is friendly and the food is good although the portions are a little small
I met a friend for lunch here last week and I can't get the food out of my mind
The bread they give you when you're seated is so fresh and has some sort of pizza-like flavoring that is delicious
I ordered the wild mushroom risotto and it was amazing
Definitely going back!
If you are loking for subdued lighting, quiet conversation, and food cooked to perfection, go elsewhere
With reservations we were seated at a table that abutted other dinners
The wait staff is distracted
If you ask for cheese on your pasta be prepared for the waiter to grate it in the same spot on you pasta, apparently it is a great effort to move one's hands
The pasta is just short of al dente
But if you like over-priced ordinary dinner fare, this is the place for you
Reservations Required!! My boyfriend and I went here before seeing Proof (which was excellent btw), and the food was absolutely delicious and atmosphere romantic
On the expensive side, but hey, it's manhattan!!
I write a lot of reviews on City Search and rarely a bad one
But Lasagna deserves every negative adjective you can find
The food is bad
The service is horrific
The waiter ignored us for ten minutes, the restaurant was empty, got our drink orders wrong, got one main dish order wrong and the disappeared for another ten minutes before we could get the check
Eat here, knowing that the food is bad and the service is worse, much worse
I ate here with several friends last night and the experience was worse than awful
The staff was incredibly rude, the waiter ignored us and the food was cold when it was finally served
When we mentioned this politely to the manager he acted as if we had done something wrong
I don't write many reviews and I'm not a picky restaurant diner, but this was perhaps my worst dining experience since moving to new york two years ago
I have been there many times and really enjoyed the food and the excellent service
There must be a new owner because the place has really gone doewn hill since the last time I was there
The service went from excellent to terrible
We had to ask for water multiple times, there were no paper towels in the bathroom and even after informing a staff person they still were none an hour later
The orders were delivered to the wrong table and we had to flag down the owner several times
The place which used to be packed until very late was practically empty on a Friday night by 10:00
When I asked the owner (who was horribly dressed) what happened to the service he did not apologize and said that they were short staff
All in all a very disappointing experience
My husband and I went here on a Friday night
We got there early and by the time we left the place was packed
The food was great- we had the stratachilla soup, which was amazing, a pasta, and a chicken dish
We both loved everything
I was tempted to try the dessert because I've heard rave reviews about it, but we were stuffed, as the portions are fairly large
The hosts were very nice, as was the ambience
I can't wait to go back!
The food was totally awsome
We triped on this one instead of going to another place across the street!
I have been to this place mutliple times and always enjoyed myself! The lasagna is a great value as the portions are large and the prices are cheap
I would recommend it for a relaxed dinner though as the service can be a little slow
When visiting New York last week, we were recommended to try Lasanga
It was disappointing
The food was slow and when it actually did arrive, the order was taken wrong
One member of the group received their meal 20 minutes after the rest and the meal that was sent back to get the correct type of fish still came back incorrect
The only saving grace was the bottle of wine that was given to us in regards to the poor service at this restaurant
The dining room feels a little like a basement with low ceilings and a need of fresh air, but the staff is happy and helpful
Reasonable prices and laid back atmosphere where they will keep your wine glass full instead of rushing you
Consider getting their specials, especially the amazing Chicken Cordon Bleu
we walked in to the resturant, squeezed by our (to be) waiter (who ignored us and didnt step to the side), and straight up to the host (he was busy talking to the bar tender)
The host had asked if we wanted to sit outside, mind you it was raining
Then we were sat in the worst seat in the half-empty room
i asked if we could sit at one of the empty booths in the back
The host said that the tables were reserved
No one ever came to sit there
in fact, no one else came into the resturant after us
it was almost empty when we left
i had the ravioli, it was ok, at best, and small
my boyfriend had the lasagna, he said that it was nothing spectacular
note: they were re-modeling the interior, so the ambiance rating might improve
I went to Lasagna with a group of seven other friends and all of us had nothing but good things to say about this restaurant
The food was incredible, and the service very friendly, attentive, and prompt
All of us loved our dinners
I had the Mushroom Lasagna and all I could look forward to today was my leftovers
The Fusilli with Chicken that I tried was also wonderful
The prices were reasonable for New York
I would definitely suggest Lasagna Restaurant
(Because the restaurant is small, if you're going with a large group I suggest reservations, but there didn't really seem to be a general wait issue
)
This restaurant has preety good food, but the big plus is the bread
They serve you garlic bread when you come in which is probably the best in the city
It's buttery and served on large, toasted slices of Italian bread
They've got a bunch of lasanga's for entrees, and I got the four cheese one, which was very satisfying
I came to Lasagna as a second choice and I was absolutely blown away
The service was fast and very friendly
The atmosphere was great too

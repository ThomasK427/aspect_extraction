For lunch, opt for an outstanding, triple-decker roast turkey club or brioche burger with skin-on fries
The setting is warm and comfortable, and the staff is VERY prompt and friendly, but even more importantly, the food is DELICIOUS
My friends and I we have been here for most of the World Cup games, it is a very fun place with many good beers and the women are very cute! I recomend it a lot to anyone looking for a fun place to spend time with friends in a relax place
My Husband and brought my two your children adn me to the Cub Room for their Mother's Day prix fixe brunch and had a lovely time
The menu was creative and well-priced and the kids menu was, although not as creative satisfying to my very picky younger diners
The server we had was a sweetheart and made sure to wish me a happy mother's day twice and was very good about bringing out the kids' food sooner because they were hungy
I would definitely reccommend the place for brunch and/or for anyone with children!
I've been to many fine, hip and fun restaurants in NYC and this one is disappointing to say the least
Our server was nice, but overtaxed
The food came out late and when it did, we learned that the chef ran out of one of the items when our meals were already on the table
They actually tried charging us for a meal that we didn't even want
When we asked to speak to the owner, he didn't care enough to even explain the situation, let alone make good on a really disappointing night out
Finally we found him in the bar and quite persuasively dragged him over to speak to us
In the end, he begrudgingly paid for one of our bottles of wine
But he couldn't take back the negative experience! I'm sure it was a real hot spot once, but it's obvious, it's lost its luster
I go to the Cub Room a lot after work for drinks with my friends and coworkers
My parents were in town visiting me last weekend and I took them here b/c I thought it was a more accessible trendy spot that they would feel comfortable in
They really loved the atmosphere and the industrial/trendy design mix
The food, as always, was excellent (love the tartare!) and my dad was wowed by the scotch selection
The new server we had was surprisingly well-versed on the menu and gave really solid service
Definitely a great place for different generations to dine!
I had dinner at the Cub Room the other night for the 2nd and LAST time
I don't mind spending money on a good meal, but to spend over $230 for a under cooked and confusing dinner experience is ridicules
I do not understand how this place can stay in business with its prices and quality of food
I left the Cub Room with my date hungry, disappointed and embarrassed
Never again!!!
This classic NY restaurant lives up to its reputation
Great steaks and delicious desserts
The wine list was very good and the bar area was a cool place to hang before we sat down for our great meal
They also have a DJ who plays great house music on thursday night
(that was the night we went) Highly recommended
This lounge bar has the lighting, decoration and background music that gives a real feeling of an elegant, comfortable neighborhood place to hang out--definitely a great place for a dates
Also, the bartender knew everything when it came to whiskey and vodka
A bit quiet on Monday, but it was great to be able to hear my date
I would suggest making this your hangout  YT
The chef here means business
The food here is so good it makes you rethink what good food is
Among everything else mentioned below, the STAKE is one of my favorites
Wine list is great, waiters know a lot about the wines
Celeb sightings have happened to me more than once here
If you dont have a reservation for dinner (and you're not famous) dont even THINK about trying to get a table here - you will be turned away or offered the opportunity to scrounge for an open table by the bar which is always PACKED
You would never purposely go see a bad movie, or send a close friend on a boring blind date
So why subject your pallette to mediocrity that plagues us in everlasting quest for the ideal dining
Do yourself a much deserved favor and make plans to have a meal at THE CUB ROOM!!!
I must admit i was very skeptical of the cub room, having read so many bad reviews, when i walked into the restaurant this weekend
But i must admit, i left the premises feeling very satisfied with the quality of service and meal provided
The bar staff was excellent and charming and kept me entertained while my table was prepared
The server i was seated with was very nice and helped to put together a fine meal
I must recommend the daily special to all, mine was excellent
And afterwards I had a great time lounging at the bar and drinking myself into Bukowski-esque stupor
Good times
i really like this place, it's a incredible and beautiful place, i have been personnally surprised by the service and the food that i found perfect and just great, rarely are the restaurants in NYC with such a big space, it is huge, it's just like three restaurants in only one
I like the decoration , perfect for a date or a family dinner, I have been amazed by the 2 bars and the quality of the different cocktails
It is just great
The food is priced decent
it's the liquor that will run up the bill
I had a one apt, 2 main courses, desert and 2 drinks a piece and it ran well over 100 bucks
The place is quite nice and very large, you'll get confused on what door you need to walk into the place to get there
We went late nite
i
e
11pm on the weekend and the service was fine
They did run out of some of the specials and main dishes which was disappointing
Also the tables for 2 are small as hell
It's a good place to eat but nothing really stood out as exceptional
or bad for that matter
Just a 'meh
' but I'd recommend it
The food was great, once we finally got it
Hostess staff courteous, waitress pleasant but harried, but given the caliber of the restaurant, and the size of the bill, I was surprised to see rookie mistakes like we did
We got our starters, and then waited an hour for our apps
However, during that time, we were served someone elses main course, which we sent back, which the staff tried to serve to two other tables in our room, one of which had already received their bill
Why not use table numbers? Who was the expeditor? Where was the kitchen manager? There didnt seem to be any type of system in place or communication amongst the staff
Management should train the staff to be more efficient, it would have cut our meal time by an hour, and other patrons would not have to wait
My boyfriend and I were looking forward to the Cub Room to celebrate Valentine's Day
The place was packed, but we had reservations for 8:30
We were told to go wait in the little bar room in the back and weren't seated until nearly 10pm
The prixfix dinner, both us us got the lobster and we finished the order with the creme brulee sampler
While the sampler and dessert were wonderful, the calamari was tasteless and rubbery, the steak in my 'salad'- ie: lettuce, was apparently the leftover grisles from a better cut of meat and both our lobsters were cold and gummy
Definitely NOT worth the $85 per person for the food alone
The single red rose they gave out on the way out was a nice touch, but by then we'd already decided that we'd never be back
What a disappointment!
We were told they were serving their regular menu -- turns out it was $85/person, without a lot of variety or choice
We waiting over 20 minutes for the wine MENU, and then and additional 20 minutes for our wine
The first two courses were average, but then my lobster dish showed up cold
I sent it back twice, before finally refusing the dish altogether (and opting for the ravioli, which was average at best)
Our dinner took close to three hours, and we were constantly flagging down our server to get the next drink/course/bill
I would not recommend this place, especially on a special night
Our extremely long evening began when I tried to postpone the reservation by 15-30 minutes and was told that it was not a good idea because they were very busy
I agreed and moved our reservation from 7:45 to 8:45
We should have left our reservation for 7:45 because they were running over an hour behind
We finally sat down around 10:00pm only to be served cold and undercooked food
I ordered a steak medium and it could not even be called rare
It was definitely NOT worth the $35 per person
NEVER again!!!
I came here during restaurant week with a group of 8 friends
We had a private room out back which was amazing
There was a big, solid wood, country style, long dining table with a rustic fireplace and candles
It was quite impressive
The service was okay, although we found ourselves signalling for service quite often

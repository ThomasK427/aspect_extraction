Too much cilantro in the food
I used to go to their old branch on Second and that was a treat
good ambience
good food
etc
Too bad they had to close that one
Wish this one was just as good
Went here with my parents and it was fabulous! Although If you sit in the way back it is tougher to have a comfortable meal as you are always getting up and down
Service was very good (and the tablecloths were sparkling clean!)
Ordered 3 dishes and all were excellent
Was recommended in the Michelin Green Guide and it didn't disappoint
Hint: most of the diners were Chinese
Bland tasteless food
Dirty tablecloths
I have had better Chinese food from a can in the grocery store
Hard to describe the taste, since there wasn't much of one
Don't bother with this restaurant
In Short Asia Roma, a festive upscale retaurant that attracts lots of large parties, is aptly situated on the intersection of Chinatown and Little Italy
Many come for the Italian-Asian fusion menu alone, which features everything from clams casino to chicken satay to teriyaki salmon
But the karaoke downstairs is the real draw: You and your friends can sing yourself silly in absolute privacy, for nothing more than the cost of dinner and drinks
I've been visiting Asia Roma regularly, and finally decided to write a review for it
What can I say about this place; great food, great service, great karaoke
The karaoke system may seem a tad outdated
But boy, do I really sound like a star when I'm in Asia Roma
Foodwise, I love their hrimp with pesto sauce, clams casino and pan fried dumpings
For entree, I usually go for either the lamb chop or sesame beef
What I like most about this place? It's like Cheers
You walk in the bar, and everyone, from the patrons to the waitstaffs, know you by name and treat you like a friend
I Jumped off the bridge on this one
I decied to try thier Italian Food and was very disapointed
I should have just bought a jar of sauce and some dried pasta
I would have been happier
Maybe the chinese food was better but I did not see anything on the main menu
The place was a bit loud as well because of the Karoke in the Basement
Oh well you live and learn
Keep walking till you see the real italian fair

Decided to hold a B-Day party here based on the Citysearch ranking of one of the top group destinations
Let's just say that whoever took the pictures for the website must have been a Photoshop pro!! This place was dingy and had a dirty feel to it
The service was terrible!! One of our guests chose three different main dishes on the menu and to each one was told, we're fresh out of that
How could they be fresh out of it when we were the first ones to have dinner that day
Then they had the nerve to include one of those nonexistant dishes on the check
I don't recommend it and I don't know what Citysearch was thinking
So many cool reestaurants have so little staying power---but not Asia Roma
Their food is consistently extraordinary
It's my favorite
We went there with two friends from out of town, it took 45 for the appetizers to be brought out and even then only one came out the other was brought with our entrees all of which came out at different times
The food was passable but nothing special, the atmosphere was dank at best, and when we informed the manager about the poor service he didnt seem to care
My husband and I recently hosted a party for some family and friends, and we had it at the restaurant's lower level
Everyone had such a great time! The food was delicious (love that salmon!), the wait staff was very attentive, and even the DJs were accommodating
If you're looking for a good time and something different to try with the family, this is definitely the place to go!
Came here for a party and had such a good time I later wind up booking one for my boyfriend's birthday
It's not often that you can have a very enjoyable dinner and party all night
We all enjoyed the food so much
And the singing and dancing afterwards was absolutely the best time we've had
It was a busy night and they should have more staff, but it was ok
After making a reservation for my sister's bday party 2 weeks IN ADVANCE, I get a call from the restaurant 4 days before the date saying they can't accommodate me since they have another party coming in for the same time - would I like to move my dinner 2 hours before the time I wanted or 1
5hrs after? Ridiculous! What is the point of making a reservation if they bump you last minute?? Other reservation came in after mine but they decided to give that one preference, no explanation!
We were delightfully surprise at the food this hide away place
Everything tasted amazingly fresh, very flavorful
We didn't think the Italian flair of it would match up, but it was better than the food in Littly Italy, which we normally go to
And the karaoke was so entertaining (we just watched other people sing
)
I was on jury duty one day and stumbled upon this restaurant
I was very satisfied with my entire meal from the appetizer to the main course
I'd definitely go back again
Everytime I have been there it is a disaster in the service, food quality has gone down and they make you wait an hour , run up a tab at the bar only for no table in sight
We had a huge argument with them last time and refused to pay the bar tab if they didnt seat us and we were seated right away, but I swore never to go back there
Here's the scene
World Cup
We make reservations 3 weeks in advance and walk in 5 minutes after the game starts to find we have no table
We get berated and lectured about being 5 minutes late
It takes 30 minutes to get coffee, 40 minutes to get our order taken and are told we can choose from 4 Items
We choose and 30 minutes later, we are served
Unfortunately, my meal is wrong
Our coffee was never refilled, the food was mediocre at best and the staff was rude and arrogant
75
00 later (2 people) we decided we would never give Felix another dime
A prix fix menu and you still can't give us decent service? No thanks
Go elsewhere
These staffers are far too into themselves and each other to care about your dining experience
Decent food BUT the service was horrible
We had reservations and were seated immediately - good start
But then we were completely forgotten
Requests for drinks were repeated over and over (including water); then after waiting well over an hour we were told that they forgot to put our order in! Their desserts were limited - I mean REALLY limited to 2 items (nothing like the online menu)
And then, after being treated like we were invisible, after our bill was paid for, the hostess came down on our table like a hawk and told us that we had to leave immediately as there were others waiting
Others waiting
All of a sudden we were visible and not even given the courtesy of 5 minutes to get our coats on
I wonder if those people waiting had to WAIT well over an hour for their food, too!
Sunday is funday but make sure to bring cash
it looks like they like to add a little too much on the receipt
We were surprised how packed it was on an august Sunday yet in 30 min we had a table
The eggs Florentine and the spinach with goat cheese are really good
Price was reasonable and the hip crowed realises a positive and vibrant energy
It's great for a sunny, breezy day as the breeze blows from all angles of the ceiling-tall window doors
It was a very enjoyable spontaneous experience for two gals looking to catch up on their news
We had chosen with my wife and friends Felix for our Sunday brunch, and we were very pleased with the food (fantastic omelettes and eggs benedicte) and the ambience (lots of people, good spirit) ; so overall, a great place, better than many restaurants around
Don't forget your reservation if you plan to come on a Sunday
The attitude of the hostess leaves something to be desired
As my friends and I chatted - trying to overcome the pure average-ness of the food - we watched the hostess overtly point out our table to the waitstaff and patrons

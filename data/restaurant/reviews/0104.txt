You would never know it from the decor
And if you're looking to get drunk quickly
1 frozen drink from their machine is all it takes
What a wonderful surprise! This restaurant is great! The food was autstanding and the service attentive
Worth a visit!
Where do I start
Found restaurant from city search, menu looked outstanding
Only to go there and find that the menu was completely different than the website
Classified as a seafood restaurant they only had two fish dishes, and the menu was mostly bar food
18 dollars for a club sandwhich
The only positive thing was the bartender and his fabulous drinks
If you ever do go, request Andrew's own Cosmo
We went here for Valentine's Day and they had a very cute prix fixe menu
The food was wonderful and the service was amazing
Get the chocolate hazelnut cake
it was like heaven!! The place has a great ambience and is perfect for a romantic evening
good fish and great calamari, good service but a little slow, definitely worth a shot if you're in midtown
The 3 course lunch is a good deal at $20
The service is a bit slow
Our lunch lasted 1
75 hours
The food was good though
The Scene Although most of the patrons are tourists, you may spy a few locals noshing away, though they may deny it later
The chain's ostentatious Eastern-flavored decor looks like something out of the Asian pavilion at Disney's Epcot Center: Red cloth lanterns hang from high ceilings, oriental prints adorn the walls and a gold, supermodel-thin Buddha presides over diners
The Food While the samplers seem like the way to go, it's actually better to mix and match dishes like the sumptuous Malaysian curried chicken potstickers and the crispy calamari
Lobster and shrimp spring rolls and vegetable dumplings tend to be on the bland side, and while the sushi is tasty, it's not always spectacularly fresh
Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks
You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY
For great chinese food nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away
For asian fusion, there are many places further downtown
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price
The dim sum however was very good
If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount
If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq
I've always loved Ruby Foo's so when friends visited from out of town, I knew they'd enjoy it
With eye popping decor and a friendly staff, there are plenty of options for those who are picky; there's even vegetarian options
There's thai, chinese, and japanese to pick from and even an extensive drink menu
The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious however the server wasn't very knowledgable when it came to questions
The mango teas were delicious but didn't know I'd have to pay for each refill
Other than that, it was a great night out
This place is terrible

server was rude
Expected similiar food/quality to blue water grille since they charge blue water grille prices
sushi had no flavor
dumplings also had no flavor
crab and shrimp rice was decent
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls)
The food was great
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food
A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square
Overall, worht every penny
I love this place more and more everytime i go
Great food, great lay out and awesome service
I've always been seated propmtly
If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid
The only reason you wouldnt like Ruby Foo's is if you absolutely cant stand Asian Cuisine
If thats not the case, get there quickly so you too and fall in LOVE with RUBY FOO'S!!!!
I've been dragged here before and it's horrible
If you make a reservation, they'll make you wait anyway
If you don't, you're only allowed the table for a short period of time (and they will ask you to leave)
The servers are robots of too much information and everything is so rushed it was making me anxious
It's more of a feeding trough than a dining experience
The food is underwhelming and overpriced and after the last time I was there, when a manager pulled a server into the back and she reemerged wiping tears off of her face, I don't plan on giving them my business again
go here
if you love spring rolls like I do
If you don't go here anyway you are sure to find plenty of things that you will love!
This is one of my favorite resturants in the city
Yes; it may be packed with lots of tourists and may be on the pricey side, but the food is great
I have never had a bad dish at Foo's
All the aptz
are great; Lettuce Wraps, Crab and Lobster Spring Rolls, Calamari with peanut thai sauce, Asain glazed ribs, and always edamame with sea salt
The maki rolls are great, they will even make your own (if they have it, they'll make it), as well as the main dishes, one of my favorites is Kung Pao Chicken with peanuts
Passion Fruit Cosmos are great and the Triple Layer Chocolate Cake is heaven
Me and my girlfriends are always up for dinning at Fooooo's
I have been to both brodaway and times square ruby foos and each time i can not find fault
The decor is great as is the service and the food
portions are big so do not over order which is easy to do with the choices
leave room for one of their delicious desserts
I really enjoyed the pineapple rice and mixed dim sum
We found the service friendly on all occasions and the fact you can see the kitchen is both interested and reliving
it looks spotless
I went on 10/9/05  I was very disappointed! I heard of this Asian Fusion restaurtant in Time out NY magazine and was excited when I saw Ruby Foo's in Time Sq
Atmosphere is wonderful, decor is very nice, exciting and very crowded
May be crowded from all the tourist
Quick service from waitress and prompt sitting for a Sunday evening
Appetizers were gross and main course was worse

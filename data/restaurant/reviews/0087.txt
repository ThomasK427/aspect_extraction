Maybe I'd try dinner
But it is a bar
Liked the feel and look of the place, very authentic
Food was okay but way overpriced
Good place to go for drinks
The food is surprisingly good, and the decor is nice
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game
Too bad, has a lot of potential
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade
Busy, busy at lunch, but quick and friendly
People in the neighborhood seem to love it, too
The Scene Tall tabletop candles cast an amber glow across the small dining room, making everyone--amorous couples, business diners and casual Tribeca regulars--look their very best
Light glints off gold Klimt-esque paintings, and mosaics spiral across the ochre walls in a busy, Belle Epoque pattern
Few fine dining rooms are this comfortable; with plush velvet curtains and high-backed settees, it's easy to surrender to the sumptuous service
Prepare for lots of unexpected extras
The Food	 Executive Chef Mario Lohninger (a Munich-trained Wolfgang Puck alum) prepares David Bouley's Austrian classics and "modern eclectic" dishes with finesse
Wiener schnitzel, a puffy cloud of crisp crumb-encasing juicy veal, and fork-tender, spicy beef goulash, are nonpareil
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce
Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee
And desserts, such as the gigantic chocolate-hazelnut souffl, are unequivocally over-the-top
Danube is extremely romantic but also perfect to go for large parties since the dining room is not over crowded
We had the 5 course tasting menu and had the waiter select a perfect bottle of wine to go with our selections
They spread out the timing of each course perfectly so that we could enjoy the wine and talk without feeling rushed at all
The service is impeccable as well as the food
Everything presented beautifully and tasted as delicious as it looked
Definitely worth a visit to try different types of foods
At the end they present you with a taste of mini cookie platter
Also, the customer service is superb
When you leave they give you a little loaf of lemon bread
Wonderful place to eat!
Dined on a Tuesday night w/ a reservation and were seated right away (dining room was half empty)
The tables are close and there is a single, long candle on each table
The dining room seems a bit formal and there is no music
The menu consists of a tasting selection, Austrian, traditional American, and the chef's recommended menu
We ordered the goulosh (beef) and the halibut
Both good, but not excellent
While the staff was kind and attentive, our waiter never once broke a smile, even when I told him it was my friend's birthday, although he did bring a dessert with a candle at the end of the meal
The sommelier was knowledgable, friendly, and let us sample several before choosing
All in all a pleasant experience, but not worthy of an excellent review in my opinion (Our dinner for 2 came to $130 + tip)
We were there on Sat night celebrating our friends anniversary
The restaurant was recommended to them by someone who used to work there
She even recommended what to order
Us, girls, made a mistake of listening and ordered from the tasting menu
Nothing we tried from the tasting menu was good
My husband did make some good choices from their regular menu, but still it was not worth $150/person
Service was courteous, but something was missing
Waiters said all the right things but in a robotic kind of way
I didnt feel welcome there at all
The place is small, or at lease it felt that way b/c tables were right on top of each other
Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess that was clearly out of her league
She lacked refinement and taste
The wait staff were pompous and rude
The food was not memorable in any way
The wine list was very expensive with most, if not all, bottles starting at $100
We were extremely disappointed with so many other restaurant choices we could have made instead
We had 8:00 reservations on a Wed night and were not seated until 9:00
even though half of the restaurant was empty! It didn't get much better
Our waiter was harmless enough - we didn't see him much - if you want constant attention, this is not the place for you
The food was unremarkable
I was expecting something really good and it was marginal at best
We had the tasting menu and I know it was more than $200 and so not worth it
The decor was worn and staid
OLD crowd and there wasn't much going on
You could hear the trains running - it sounded like they were coming through the walls
People were wearing jeans and t-shirts in the bar and dining room
Not at all what I expected - I thought it was supposed to be a nice restaurant
Spend your money elsewhere
Great appetizers, good entrees
Didn't like having to flag down waiters for drinks, nor having to wait almost 15 minutes for a check after asking two servers
Beautiful space however
On a mid-June night, guess what? When patrons enter the restuarant, TELL THEM that the A/C is broken
We sweated our butts off the entire 2
5 hour meal (we ordered the tasting menu)
Then, when we spilled wine, the dirty tablecloth was never changed
The food was amazing
Everything else? Sucked
I realize it takes time to fix an A/C in Manhattan but come ON
$300 for dinner, and we sweat to death? Not cool
Again the food was truly incredible, but overall, the experience was horrendous
And the flowers on the table were wilted
What the??
The restaurant was very elegant with most guests wearing suits and dresses
The service was excellent with a wine steward recommending a great wine
The food choices were a bit unique so if you are a steak and potatos person then this may not be the place for you
The venison was excellent and I highly recommend it
The ambience was very nice and the restaurant was fairly small with excellent service
I would definitely recommend the place for a nice upscale meal
Celebrated my fiance's 30th b-day at Danube on a Friday night
The interior is absolutely beautiful and very elegant
The hostess and waitstaff were cordial, helpful and pleasant, not at all overbearing
And the food, was exquisite! My dessert was heavenly
Although it is very expensive it's totally worth it
The only con is the sommelier who kept pushing the expensive wines
The space is great and comfortable - not cramped at all
It is even quiet so you can have a conversation
The only problem was the 'over-service' - finally a place where you can hear your date, but you end up spending more time talking to wait staff
How many times do I have to decline bread and pretzels? The food is excellent so long as you like Austrian cuisine
There are less expensive places for sausages, snitzel, and wine and but none that look like this
I went for my 1 year anniversary and everything was perfect
I didn't see the bill, so I can't comment too much on the price, but judging from the prices on the menu, it was pretty standard for this type of restaurant

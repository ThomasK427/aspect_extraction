Also, the overall attitude was friendly and warm- no attitude at all
I'm sorry others haven't had a great experience but give it a try if you like great food, great service and reasonable prices for what you get!
While the setting is very romantic and the restaurant itself is beautiful, the food was bland and pretty unsatisfying
we got the $48 prix fixe and while it was a good value I guess, not really since we didn't particularly care for anything
Our waiter was extremely condescending, even though I work in the restaurant business, and was zero help with the wines
Our table made us feel like we were in the way the whole time, especially as servers zipped past us as we begged for bread and water
I called and wrote a letter to the management to let them know what an awful dinner we had, but have never heard from them again
Will definitely not go back and will tell others to do the same
I finally got into L'Impero and was very disappointed
The food was good, but not outstanding
The service was average and the table we sat at was incredibly uncomfortable
I won't be going back
The night we went they were filming for the new spiderman movie
The staff was attentive and helped us with questions o the menu
The fois gras/duck was great
The polenta w/ vegetables was also very tasty
I had their signature dish, the baby goat
It had a very unique flavor that definately hit the spot
The dessert was ok
Definately a spot to come back to if you want to make the trip to a unique spot in he big city
Had a romantic evening there and the food was fabulous, especially the baby lamb
They also have a very nice wine list, some hard to find wines but also priced accordingly
Well worth the money
We had a great time at L'Impero
The food was fairly outstanding especially the duck/frois gras ravioli and the pasta with sea urchin
The real deal was the 4 course tasting menu for $48
You get an appetizer,a pasta course,a main course and dessert or cheese course
And it's not restricted to the whole table,everyone can choose whatever they want
The place is a little hard to find (you have to enter on 41st street) but it's worth it
Excellent
We were 20 minutes late for our reservation and they held our table, and were more then helpful and gracious, excellent all around
I have been to this restaurant 4 times in the past few months
It is very located in midtown near the UN
The food is great, the service is smooth and the place is sexy! I have eaten here for lunch and dinner, the menu is very broad
The simple dishes are perfect and the more complex dishes, very interesting and creative
Unlike any other Italian restaurant in the city
I would like to mention the experience my guests and I had at L'Impero was pleasant
Then again, my guests and I are not overly demanding and set out for high expectations
What I do expect is the ability to spend quality time with our guests
Of course I care about the food, service, and atmosphere
and the delight of it all, my guests and I were taken care of with high expectations
It was more than what we had anticipated and without interrupting our dining experience
The food was hearty, aromatic, and served to the exact proportions
I had overheard this old Italian couple behind me, exclaiming how the food reminded them of home
I wanted to turn around and ask them, Where might that be? Yes, L'Impero is a restaurant that you will have a 2-hour meal
Isn't that what your guests deserve, unless misery seeks misery
After much anticipation for this restaurant, my party waited 35 mins to be seated after our scheduled reservation, even after being on time; There was no apology from the restaurant
We all chose the prix fixe, and only a select few items lived up to the hype
The rest were bland and not exciting
The service was extremely slow and unattentive
If you don't like your dinner taking a minimum of 2
5 hours, then this is not the place for you
Our waiter then miscalculated our check
We figured this was an apology for the late seating (the cost of the two bottles of wine)
We didn't say anything, just to save face
After leaving, the waiter chased us down the street and made us return to the restaurant to correct the error
We will never return to this restaurant again
Valentine's lunch
Easy reservation, helpful and unpretentious staff
Chef in the house
Unimaginative deco: tight spaces where busboys could hardly work; ceiling looked like shiny formica, drappery blandly covers huge pillars throughout
The prix fixe lunch is a deal
Polenta with a mushroom-truffle reductionis perfectly executed, creamy and earthy all at once
Braised short ribs over farro risotto come topped with ethereal parmiggiano shavings
Braised duck and foie gras agnolotti are gently kissed by a passito reduction
Sea urchin explodes in an aromatic strigoli al nero di seppia (black home-made pasta finished in mussel broth): mouthgasmatic
The capretto (young goat) should become a classic, while the branzino (mediterranean sea bass) over lentils does not light up the palate
Desserts are nicely unpretentious and complement an excellent meal
Wine by-the-glass is overpriced and on the small side
Conant's cooking is Apolonian balance to Batali's Dyonisian excess
Well worth it
Dined with 4 on a Monday afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away
Service was prompt and friendly and food was melt in your mouth delicious
Mushroom variety appetizer, duck entree and chocolate cake dessert were all delightful
The only thing that was somewhat disappointing is the restaurant's aesthetic - it's very dull and boring w/ white linen cloths and white drapes hanging throughout - this place needs to a new interior decorator
Was also a bit disappointed not to have been able to see the much hyped chef while we were there - I've been told he's quite easy on the eyes
I've been here three times now
Getting a reservation isn't the easiest but well worth a try
The have a great $48 prix fixe menu in which you can order almost any appetizer and almost any entree and desert - well worth it
Had the tasting menu last time ($89?) with the cheese pairing and the only thing I can say is 'Oh my God!' It was great and the somelier (or whatever they are called in Italian) helped us pair up some great half bottles of wine (we were only 2!) with the meal
Wan't cheap ($350ish) but WELL WORTH IT!!!
If unsure of what to order, follow the suggestions of your server
Excellent food, staff, lighting, ambience
Will be back many times
Low noise makes it easy to have dinner conversation without shouting
This place rox
I took my girlfriend there for X-Mas dinner, and we were treated to a very delicious meal, with the servive to boot
They won't rush you, nor are they quick to point out the most expensive wine/dishes
Also, there is no rush at all
You can take as long as you want
Given its superb quality, L'Impero's $48 four course prix fixe is perhaps the best dinner bargain in town
The cuisine is ultra-glorified peasant food; the stunning mushroom fricasse starter, for instance, sounds humble: four types of mushrooms atop polenta
But those mushrooms are bathed in a dreamy truffle reduction sauce, which is luxuriously absorbed by the meltingly creamy polenta
Spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce, that most basic of Italian pasta dishes, is a revelation of bright, fresh flavors; farfalle with bitter greens and sweetbreads is at once earthy and graceful, the tartness of the greens playing wonderfully against the richness of the sweetbreads
Savory baby goat has deservedly won accolades, while ruby-red slices of venison are tender and hint just enough of gaminess
The dessert list is short but sweet; and the cheese plate was tempting
I'll be sure to sample it the next time--which will be soon
Working at the UN there are a lot of old hat places to eat with in walking distance
It is rare to find something new wearth talking about
We stumbled onto this place on our walk up 43rd to Grand Central

) The portions were fair, good service
The restaurant is quite small and the seating is tight but everything was clean, including the surprisingly nice bathrooms
I'll definitely be back for a return visit
great soba, but other stuff is quite tasty-- my fave is the garlic tuna over rice! I've been here many times
be forewarned that it's quite crowded during peak evening hours (45 minute wait)
Lunch specials are great deals, and you get lots of food
My 3 year old neice also loves this place
Great noodle soups
Not exactly a Raman noodle, as Sobaya uses authentic buckwheat noodles
Now the price is in the 15 dolar range, not bad seeing as they have large soups w plenty of vegies/toppings
Problem is most people rank it as cheap
This is one grade above in food, service, ambience, and price
There are other more affordable noodle themed shops nearby
Staff was friendly and enthusiastic about educating me on Asian cusine
Not a bad affordable date spot
The soba is supposedly flown in from Japan, but I didn't taste anything special in the soup nor the noodles
I had the duck noodle soup, but it wasn't exceptionally good
The duck was tough, chewy, friend with batter, and simply tasteless
If you're looking for a japanese restaurant with less emphasis on sushi, Sobaya is a great choice
The noodles are good hot or cold, and I personally love their tempura dishes
The service is excellent as well
Friendly, and you never have to ask for more water et al
The deserts are a bit too expensive given their size, but it's still an excellent coice
I am a lover of noodles, and because of that, I am a lover of Sobaya
Rich, smoky, complex duck broth soups, excellent herring udon, nice little bites of sushi as accompaniments, a buzzing atmosphere in a beautiful setting
you really should go there
I like the soba better than the udon, and try to get in before 7 to take advantage of the excellent dinner deals
Watch the chef handmake your sobu noodles while you wait
Yes it's a bit packed, but worth a short wait (don't wait more than 20 mins)
Get the sobu noodles, and enjoy a taste of Tokyo tucked away
Great portions, a fun place to try with someone who wants to try real Japanese w/o sushi
Don't go with more than 4 people, it's too small
Very friendly staff
One of the best noodle places in town
A little crowded but who cares
Service always attentive and an amazing variety of noodle combinations
Great place
For a simple, no frills, and efficient meal, you cannot do much better than this place
The restaurant is so clean, and the food so immaculately served that I feel guilty every time I go there in a not-freshly-pressed shirt
Personal highlights are the Curried Udon and the Unagi
The staff are also very polite and generally knowledgeable about the fare
It can get a little packed at times, and the a/c is could be a bit colder - but then again, it is a noodle shop
As a novice Japanese food eater, I really enjoyed Sobaya's dishes
Even though I made the faux pas of ordering two entrees instead of appetizer/entree, I enjoyed every bite of both my dishes-- noodle/veg
soba and tuna steak
The tuna steak especially was very flavorful and succulent
My only dislikes were that the ambience could be a little cozier--it seemed rather plain in there, the waitress expressed disapproval at my unorthodox choice of orders, and the cramped dining area--but that's par for the course in NY!   All in all, thumbs up, and I will bring friends back for more! It seems to get very crowded in there so come early!
So the catchy title stinks
But this is another of the Japanese restaurants along E
9th/St
Marks Ave area that stands out
The food is both authentic and fresh; and the staff is very helpful and friendly
The biggest problem is that the restaurant quickly fills up (the counter included!!!) so I've had to abandon eating at Sobaya to eat anywhere else but Shiraku (Dallas BBQ
waaah!)
Though if the restaurant got bigger, the service and quality of the food would probably suffer
I'm big on ordering the vegetarian or chicken/egg dishes with either soba or udon noodles
The boiled spinach with sesame sauce appetizer is absolutely wonderful
For under twenty dollars for a filling, delicious, and healthy meal come to Sobaya
I tend to stick with the steamed Spinach and Salmon Chiriashi, but the entire menu is good
I think J_Hunmters review was on the money, but for the Soba Houses iu the Big Apple, Sobaya is great
Also J_HJunter thinks Kiev has a 10 for ambience, so he's probably confused
As a rule of thumb, quality Japanese food is found in Japanese restaurants OWNED and MANAGED by Japanese
Sobaya is no exception
The noodles, soba, etc my group ordered were all good (we shared)
The noodles are very fresh and well made, and the broth tastes right
A bit expensive for what they offer, but it's far superior to Menchanko-tei, for example
Probably one of the better, most authentic Japanese noodle shops in NYC
Lunch boxes are a good deal and the eel is OUTSTANDING
Hot or cold, it is hard to find a comparison for the noodles
When I went for lunch last week I got the sashimi tuna lunch box, reasonably priced however it didn't compare to the quality of the eel
Definately worth a shot!
I love this place
The service is great
Everyone is enthusiastic and friendly
I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table, even when it's really crowded
Food is very good
I heartily recommend the clear soup (great smokey taste) both as an appetizer and/or as an entree with soba
Desserts are also tasty
Appetizers and sake also very good (although the appetizers come in very small portions), but expect a steep bill if you partake
Another plus: clean bathrooms!
Soba-ya, literally soba shop, is overpriced and mediocre
Although the food is prepared correctly, I have visited many restaurants, in Japan and Michigan, that better expand on the soba theme, for less cash
The concept of Soba-shop, as it appears in Japan, developed out of a need for quick, cheap, tasty food, consumed after visiting a temple or shrine
Soba-ya is neither quick nor cheap and the food is quite bland
For Soba-ya is a mere bastardization of a good concept
In my opinion, it lives up to none of the soba/temple restaurants that blanket the Japanese countryside
This is the kind of place only a few people can appreciate
I don't think tourists who are just looking for fancy places do
This place is so original,non-pretensious,laid-back, and somewhat funnky
Food is also very good
Chirashi has so many fish on rice and they are all fresh
If you are looking for a secret, relaxing place, go to Natori
Natori is my local sushi joint and I am happy for that; it has reasonably fresh sushi at very good prices
They are very friendly, have smoking and non smoking in two seperate rooms, and it's small funky atmosphere is refreshingly laid back for a sushi place
They also sell alligator meat (shoga)! Very good
And my favorite, which I have never seen anywhere else, is  Yasai Don, fresh Japanese vegetables on rice, very good
In Short With a comprehensive breakfast menu, an extensive list of burgers, sandwiches, salads and desserts, and a full bar, Around the Clock is a reliable neighborhood mainstay, popular for its ability to serve a wide range of appetites and occasions
Up the few stairs to the right of the bar, the main dining area features basic wood tables and chairs, easily configured to accommodate groups of all sizes
I've been going to this place for about 6 years now and it never has failed to disappoint
The food is great, no matter how broke you are, you can get any meal for under $10 at any time of the day or night

I've been to Delta Grill multiple times, with different groups of people, and everyone has loved it so far
There is a wide variety of Cajun style food to suit everyone
The bread that comes with dinner is hot and tasty
Service is friendly at the door, bar and table
The fried green tomatoes are my favorite
Frozen drinks are weak, so stick with something else
My wife and I opted to skip Fat Tuesday at the Grille by showing up Sunday evening
We made a great choice in that there was a festive crowd, but ample seating available
I chose to order the Southern fried Catfish on a bed of succotash, smothered in an ettoufe' sauce that pulled it all together
From the first savory mouthfull I felt I was back in the French Quarter! I can honestly say I have never had better Catfish served in all of New Orleans! If you love Cajun-Creole, you must try the Delta grille!
My dining partner and I traveled to 9th street and stumbled on this place
From the outside, it didn't look like much, but once we entered, it was like we had entered an established place in New Orleans
Before we ordered, we dined on the corn muffins (which would have been better had they been served warm)
I ordered the chicken creole, and my partner ordered from the brunch menu (French Quarter Toast which is essentially a thick french toast)
The presentation was very good on both dishes
My creole was very tasty, and my only criticism is that the portion size was pretty small
The French toast was great and on a scale of 1 to 10, it scored an 8 (if you want french toast that scores a 10, go to Suburban House in Baltimore)
Just need a Mardi Gras parade to make this more memorable!
I've never been to new orleans but after coming here I want to go
I ordered the crawfish etouffee and it was great
I will definitely go back
Its not easy to find good Cajun / Creole food in NYC, but this is about the closest I've tasted to that down in the South
The service could be better -- lack of personal attention makes you feel like they're too busy for sometimes
While the food is delicious, it comes with a price
Expect to spend $18 for catfish and rice or entrees similar to that
Had an early lunch there and husband and I both enjoyed our meal
Had the soup of the day (shrimp/corn chowder?) and Po' Boys (shrimp for me, BBQ for him)
Very quiet at that time of day (or perhaps because it was raining), waitress was very pleasant
Would definitely go there again
I am a semi-regular at the Delta Grill, and unfortunately have witnessed the decline in their food
There are still some stalwarts that you can count on, but you have to be careful with what you order
The Muffaletta is a little disappointing, while the Cheese Grits still rock
The Gumbo is great, but the crawfish fizzles
Not sure what the problem is back in the kitchen, but yes I have to admit that its started to drop off
Hope they can get the mojo back
I'm not sure what these other people are talking about
I walked out of the Delta last weekend knowing that the pork chops were the best I'd ever had
Two thick and tender slabs of chop were excellent! That was the second time I'd been there and each time I'd been very satified with my meal
The first time I went, I got the crawfish etouffe
very good
If you're looking for an excellent, reasonably priced meal
this is it!!!
Went on a friend's recommendation, and I'm so glad I did
It was pretty crowded, but we were seated immediately (2 people, 6:30 pm on a Saturday night)
The jambalaya was delicious, and I don't know why some other reviewers are throwing accusations of blandness--it was very spicy, just at the edge of my heat tolerance
The portion was generous, too; I had enough leftovers for a good lunch the next day
The service was a little harried but well within acceptable ranges
And the key lime pie is to die for
My husband and I love this restaurant
We live in the neighborhood, and often bring family and friends to dinner at Delta Grill
Everyone has really enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere
I would highly recommend this restaurant--I've never been disappointed by its food
This is by far the worst meal out, I have ever eaten
The staff is nice, but they have the awful job of having to sell bland food as amazing treats
The appetizers are better tasting than the entrees
Skip the pork chop if you don't like tasteless slabs of meat on your plate
The food is so awful you will feel embarrassed for suggesting it to your friends!
My friends and I have returned here 3 times
We are often the kind of people who would not spend up to 20 $ a meal for each person
but this place is special!!! If your anything like my friends and I try this place at least once for a special occasion! Highly recommend the Leonores Chicken and Jambalya
New Orleans fare has become difficult to find as of late
This restaurant serves very good cajun/creole food
They are a little understaffed, making the service a bit slow at times
But it's forgiveable, where else can one get good jambalaya and a bottle of red voodoo ale?
This place would actually be a nice value for good food, but the service is terrible
Open tables abound, but they still act like seating you is a tremendous favor
After sitting for 15 minutes, the waitress finally gave us menus and took a drink order
20 minutes later she came back and asked anything else? without ever bringing us drinks or taking a food order
When our meal was finally done, she lost my credit card! The manager was obnoxious when I complained, saying it was all no big deal
The Delta grill is a nice slice of Nawlins' in New York
The hurricanes, though not as good as Pat O's, were nice and strong
The appetizers and soups were in such portions that we didn't order a main
The turtle soup (special) and chicken and andouille gumbo were great
Same for the alligator sauce piquant, hushpuppies, and fried okra - but get the dipping sauce from the hushpuppies instead
Service was more than adequate and on a Wednesday nght parking was not difficult
The atmosphere is like many bars I've been to in bayou country
I'm not sure how it is during the theater dinner time, but otherwise its a solid spot - good for a date, but sit by the fireplace
Raised in the great City of New Orleans, I have come to expect very much from eating establishments and I concede that immitating creole cuisine is not easy
I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant's attempt
Although it wasn't authentic, it was pretty damn close and pretty damn good all the same
So far, it's the closest I've encountered in the city
Try it!
Awesome Southern fare, Food is out of this world
Service needs improvement, but don't let that keep you from puttin a little south in yo mouth
Crawfish Pie to start with and Lenores chicken as your entree and you'll be in heaven
Check out the ceiling fans
Host - Older guy who acted as if he was doing us a favor
Bartender - had to wait and wait then actually call his attention for a drink when he was B
S
ing for at least 10 minutes three feet away
Food - Less than average
We tried 5 things on the menu (Crab fingers, Raspberry salad, Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Crawfish and Sticky Chicken)
In short - Service was horrible, food was weak and tastless
Still really like the theme
The food is as luscious as a long slow, southern sunset
This is solid comfort food with the Cajun touch
On the weekends, sip your coffee, enjoy the chicken fried steak and let twangy blues played live aid in the enjoyment
Anyone who thinks this is good cajun has clearly never had real cajun cooking
There was KETCHUP in my jambalya! You must be kidding! Kitschy decor
They really try to make the New Orleans cuisine authentic here, I think they do a pretty great job

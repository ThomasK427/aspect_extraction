Given that snobbish attitude we decided to walk down the street and discovered Le Gigot so we decided to try it
What a wonderful experience it was
Despite it's tiny space and smallish tables the food was excellent
I had roasted free-ranch chicken that was perfumed with garlic and served with beatuifully prepared spring vegetables
The service was warm and friendly and caring
This is a must try place
I just visited this tiny little bistro on the evening of my engagement
I had read all of the reviews on this site and it sounded lovely, but I was still a little hesitant
It sounded too good to be true
But it wasn't! The ambience at Le Gigot is utterly charming, the service is impeccable, the food is delicious
A nice meal for two ran about $110, but it was worth the price if you're looking for something special!
A tiny little gem that is so cozy, you will leave there feeling so mellow
Great food, superb service and friendly staff
You will leave her thinking only of food, wine, relaxation
Someone really special took me here
I suggest the very same!
I found this place to be amazing
My lamb shank was great, osso bucco was just amazing!! Also, their soups are to die for
Brunch is great too-eggs benedict is so yummy
They have the eggs perfectly runny
Great coffee too!!! This place is worth visiting on a weekly basis
I love this place!!!!!
Dined here twice, first time for dinner then for brunch
Most amazing food I've ever ate, outstanding service, and a very reasonable price
I loved this place - a little hidden gem
Wonderful food (try the scallops), great and personal service, no rush
Very friendly and personal atmosphere
Delightful food--especially the lamb
A very good value
Very good pre-theatre choice
Excellent food, outstanding service, short (safe)walk from the 1 9 subway at Christopher St
Great value, between two people had two appetizers, three glasses of wine, two specials (lamb lobster/shrimp), one desert, one cap, all for $118
00
Service was outstanding with attention to detail
Not rushed, great atmosphere, nice bathrooms, small place, make reservations
Talked to other dinner who said he ate there maybe 5 times a week and never had a bad meal
Friendly staff
I'll be back!
This restaurant was recommended to me by many people
It was fantastic
The service was great and the atmosphere is so comfortable
The food was very good and reasonable
I am looking forawrd to going back
I had a great romantic dinner here with a new friend
I found the restaurant very accessible to the 1 and 9 subwayline, the staff was most helpful and warm
I just thought the menu strayed from the french style of cuisine that I had expected
Wife and I traveled from Philly for a day in NYC and had dinner here that night
Le Gigot is a tiny place (8 tables) on a lovely tree lined street in the Village that is romantic and serves very good bistro food
Apps and entrees were very good with desserts being a little disappointing but still good
Fairly reasonable (but small) wine list
Service was outstanding
We loved the Village and we loved Le Gigot
I read about this place on your web site and my girlfriend and I thought that we should go check it out (the Blind Tiger was closed)
We went downstairs and waited for the waitress, played a game of pool, finished the game of pool and still no waitress, no drinks
Hmmm
so we left and went down the street to the greek place and were seated and served immediately
My buddy and I went in for a quick drink and ended up staying all afternoon
Cozy Pub with great beer list and great burgers
Cool staff too!
the best part of this pub is the service
ginger was the best bartender, ginger its rob with the mickey mouse shirt lol
I have always loved the Slaughtered Lmb Pub
It is a cozy place with 3 fireplaces and great beer
I really love it on a cool fall day
Big beer selection and friendly staff
I love the burgers there and the chicken wings
We are going to make this place our regular spot
The only positive I can give this place is that they have an extensive list of beers
Our seat cushions were in tatters, the table was sticky, the music and the TVs blaring
The service was appalling - our main courses arrived 1
5 hours after we sat down
The food was the freezer-to-microwave variety
And it was all cold
We'd had enough
Fortunately the manager took all the main courses off the bill
The waitress blamed the kitchen
The manager blamed the waitress
This is an authentic English pub only if you think English pubs have skeletons hanging on the wall and a werewolf in a glass closet
Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer
The cocktail was very watered down
To top it off, the evening was overpriced
2 drinks, one appetizer and one entree came to $40
And we *used* to like this place
Never again!
REALLY FUN PLACE IN THE VILLAGE
COZY ATMOSPHERE
FRIENDLY STAFF
GREAT PLACE TO HAVE A BEER AT THE BAR OR A COZT TABLE
GOOD PUB FOOD ALSO
GREAT BURGERS
A really fun English Pub
I thought I was in London
Great Pub food and beer
A nice fireplace and cozy woodwork
finally a place I can go enjoy friendly conversation have beer and a burger and have fun
They always have the best sporting events on their T
V
's and the service is friendly and without that city attitude

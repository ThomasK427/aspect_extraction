They have absolutely no justification for their attitude problems, since this is just a glorified tourist trap with pathetically bland food
An example of the worst this neighborhood has to offer
Avoid this place at all cost!
Waiter was not incredibly friendly, but host was
Food was good although I've had better
Prices weren't too bad, either
Paesano is amazing, I've gone there 2 separate times and each time was amazing with the food, service, and ambience
With all the restaurants to choose from on Mulberry St, why Paesano? Because the food is unsurpassably amazing, servings are huge and one taste will make you just pause and be in awe
Trust me, check this place out, beautiful setting, well priced, good service
A gem of a find!!
My experience here was great! the food and service was excellent, he was very attentive and my lasanga was excellent, very reasonably priced i had a plate that could of easily fed two for only 11 dollars
It was GREAT! Highly recommended!
We stopped here because of the relatively cheaper prices compared to the other tourist traps lining Mulberry Street
The biggest problem, aside from careless service (everyone at our table got the wrong thing) is the tasteless food
I had the lobster ravioli, which was listed under specials
While the sauce was admittedly tasty, I could barely taste any lobster in the ravioli, it tasted like the frozen variety
The chicken cacciatore was even more mediocre
I'd choose another option--far from Little Italy, if possible
you might want to enjoy dinner elsewhere
Management needs to turn the air conditioner on, no fun sitting and sweating over dinner
Definately not recommended during the summer months
I was recommended to this restaurant by a friend
I was highly impressed with the service I received
The meal was above average, the portions were enormous, enough to bring home for lunch the next day and the price was better than expected
I highly recommend the Calamari Luciana to anyone, but everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled great
The waiters were polite and courteous and very helpful
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal, great service with a great price
A real Little Italy feel to the place
Paesano is everything I had heard it would be and more! The restaurant is so romantic it's the perfect place for a date and the food was not only delicious, but the portions were massive, I had to take half of it home
I can't wait to go back to my favorite italian restaurant Paesano
I went here, and I received a very standard Italian meal
While the food was not bad, a couple more dollars and a trip next door to Pellegrino's would have resulted in a much better meal
This place doesn't deserve the horror story reviews, but it doesn't deserve the reviews that heap praise at the restaurant either
When I go out to a restaurant, I come expecting something very good, especially since I cook Italian food
This did not quite fit the bill, and isn't somewhere I will return to, but I don't regret eating here
On our first visit to Little Italy our expectations for a good Italian meal were pretty high
We had no preference and chose Pasano's
To our great disappointment our meal was a DISASTER from beginning to finish!!! The food was tasteless
My spagetti marinara was horrible and one could actually taste the freeze-dried onions in the sauce - YUCK!! The service was bad and no one bothered to clean our table between the starter and main meal
Needless to say they did not get a tip! (which resulted in no one saying goodbye when we left) DO NOT GO THERE!!
This is the worst meal I have had, period
Sure, the inexpensive prices and enthusiastic hostess lured me in, but when I had the meal
boy did I regret stepping foot in there!!!!  My firend has Fettucinni Alfredo
everyone knows Alfredo sauce is supposed to be creamy
I think I've seen thicker soups than this sauce!  I had Linguini Puttanesca
it was mediocre at best
Despite being empty, the wait staff was incredibly inattentive
I had to ask him for more more than one time
This was by far the worst meal I've had in my life
I have had better at Olive Garden, and I HATE OLIVE GARDEN
A box of Barilla a jar of Ragu would've tasted better
No flavor, no taste!!
I'd have to say one of the best value for meals I've had in the city
A friend and I had a lovely bottle of wine, two appetizers, two main courses and two coffees and we had change from $40
And none of the above could be faulted
The spaghetti carbonara in particular is pretty good
The worst Italian I've ever had
And I'm Italian!! The calamari was tasteless and rubbery, the lauded baked ziti was undercooked and there's no way the marinara wasn't from a can
The service was TERRIBLE
We ended up tipping the busboy because our waiter would disappear for several minutes and return only when we flagged him down, smelling of fresh cigarette smoke
Ugh!! This was just an all around BAD experience
Don't risk it
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING MORE APPETIZING THAN A HEARTY MEAL AT PAESANO'S
YOU WON'T REGRET A STOP HERE!!!
Greatest essence of little italy on mulberry
The menu covers everyones appetites
The pastas (especially the cheesy ones) are fantastic
(i recommend the baked ziti)
Cheap too! The help is great and food is quickly prepared
Great place for romantics
Dark and soft music
Mine and my girls favorite place by far
I love Paesano's and have been there many times
I never seem to order anything other than Lobster Ravioli (by far the best I've ever had), but I always convince my friends to try something different so I can taste theirs
Amazing food!
I do and you will too if you like Linguine with Garlic and Oil
Made fresh and perefectly
Man, Joey serves it up nice and makes everyone feel like they are home and they belong
The menu has some stalwarts and some dishes with a little flair/NY style
The atmosphere is standard fare Little Italy, and nothing to brag about, but man the food is right, tight and enjoyable all night
Me and my friends go here all the time for teh buffet - it's so good! they change the food and there is plenty of variety - vegetarians and meat eaters alike
The buffet gets cold sometimes, but otherwise is fantastic
the naan here is PERFECT
Don't overlook it - the staff is a bit off (not rude, just sort of not really there), but who cares?
Cheap wine, drunk Italians and a singer with a Casio
Puglia is fun, if too loud
The food was overall bland, but the antipasto was excellent
A good place to bring out-of-towners
If you are going to the city and want some great Italian food, Puglia's is the place to be
I was raised just outside the city and had since moved away
I visited Puglia's for the first time in the ealrly 1980's and have been eating there every time I come home to visit
My children now 11 and 9 know the resturant well and always ask when are we going back
I have proberly been there over 100 time in the past 25 years
And will continue till the day I die
Jorge will entertain you as you enjoy one of the best meals you will ever eat
Puglia's is a great place to have fun and be merry!!!!  Your Friend  Richie
Definitely a favorite
Their Italian bread is divine and frankly, I could go there and just eat a loaf of that and be happy! But their traditional Italian meals are the best
I love their spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna
No frills, but some of the freshest sauces and flavors I've had

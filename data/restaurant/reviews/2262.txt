Service left a lot to be desired, the portions are a bit gluttonous, especially for a tourist who can't take leftovers
The one thing that stood out was that they don't accept credit cards, so you must have a lot of cash handy for the expensive menu items
Furthermore, we discovered other delis that were MUCH better in terms of food quality, portion size, service, and more reasonable prices
and they take plastic to boot! Save your money, avoid this tourist trap and enjoy your deli experience elsewhere
There are over 400 other delicatessens to choose from!
to go with monster sized prices
Right off the bat you need to ask yourself: is this place a tourist trap? And the answer is yes
Yes it is
That said it's still worth checking out at least if only for that classic NY feel mixed with Hollywood hype
Coming into Carnegie you're immediately struck by the hundreds and hundreds of celeb pics that line the walls
As for the food
Yea it's a rip-off
There's no other way to justify $20 for a sandwich
That said what a sandwich it is
The portions are hugggggeeeee and will most certainly fill you up and you know whats more the food tastes pretty darn good to boot
Bottom line: you balance the good and the bad and decide if it's right for you
I ordered the ruben and it was gigantic and one of the tastiest things I had ever eaten
Well, half eaten due to it's giagantic size! The meat was piled very high and the cheese was awesome
The staff was quirky and bitter at best
Others in my party enjoyed their food/portions as well
The pickels they put on your table are a weird assortment of sizes, texture and taste almost like they collected them from other retaurants!
Overall the regular food was nothing special except for the large size
Also not a great value
Eat light and save up for the strawberry cheesecake which is simply beyond belief! Ignore everything else and keep your eyes on the prize
Just paid my first, and definitely not my last visit to the Carnegie Deli while on vacation
The atmosphere was right out of a Woody Allen Movie, the servers were quick, food was fantastic- the best pastrami and corned beef I've ever had! The desserts are amazing, especially the cheesecake and the coconut creme pie
We went at an off-peak time right before the lunch rush
A definite must-see and do for anyone visiting New York
I've been going to the Carnegie for over 20 years, every time I'm in NY
It is, bar none, the best NYC Deli experience you can have
Great food, excellent NYC service and a real NYC atmosphere
I always recommend it and I've never had anyone disappointed
i know this is a tourist trap but a trip to Carnegie deli after a red eye into the city is a must and i am a tourist when i visit nyc
i have been going for 25 years since I was a kid
my dad used to bring me a dozen knishes back to L
A
when he'd go to ny
the rest of the food is okay, not great and expensive
but its an institution so worth the visit
Sandwich was so dry, it would hardly go down! Prices are out of site, manners and customer service is not to be found
Take your money somewhere that will appreciate it and you!!!
worst sandwich i've ever had - yea, it's HUGE
but who cares
it was about $60 for three people (about 20 dollars per sandwich
literally)
TOURIST TRAP
First place I ate on recent trip
Also went back for my last meal in NYC
Got here at midnight on a Friday nite ordered pastrami
Still do not believe the portions-and I completely enjoyed it, although I did not finish it
Then I had cheesecake WOW! Again the serving is too huge, but I think it's the best cheesecake I ever ate
I think it's a good thing I live in Los Angeles don't have access to this place on a regular basis! Went back several days later had chicken salad-another whopper sandwich, which I couldn't finish
Why did I get such huge portions in New York every place I ate? Chicken salad was delicious
Place felt like NY to a visitor
Gargantuan servings of wonderful food are pleasantly served in a movie style atmosphere
Any sandwich is delicious and more than you can eat
But, be sure to save room for the onion rings and the cheesecake
Both are exceptional! Accommodations are spacious
There is room for large or small groups, including families
Service is friendly, fast, and efficient
Simply amazing! From the moment you walk in and notice the huge portions, until the moment you stagger out from feasting, you realize that, Indeed I am in New York City
The atmosphere captures each of the five senses, and the food is beyond amazing! The cheescake is unmatched anywhere! Ahh to only live a bit closer, would be my only desire
The pastrami was just a little better than something you may find in a grocery store deli counter, but for the price you pay you should be getting porterhouse
$20 for a reuben sandwich? Call me crazy
The first thing you notice is the HUGE portions on the plates as the waiters/waitresses pass by
The menu prices are a bit steep, sandwiches range from $15-19 and $3 extra for sharing
Its almost worth sharing among 3 people as a normal person could not finish 1 platter
Cheesecake is delicious!!!
As a native New Yorker, I've been going to the Carnegie since I was no taller than their sandwiches
Always a reliable place (albeit packed) to hit before/after a show
But recently I have witnessed one sneaky cost cutting effort that has made me rethink my loyalty to this midtown establishment
The Matzoh Balls, which are usually the size of a basketballs, have diminshed in size exponentially
Now they are the equivalent of golf balls floating in tepid chicken-flavored water
It's not as though Matzoh Balls are expensive to begin with
So I am hoping that this travesty is only attributed to the fact that winter is not yet upon us (Matzoh Ball soup sales are weak before the frost)
If not, then I must bid yet another long-standing NY tradition farewell - and write the Carnegie off for good
This is your average tourist filled NYC deli
They have pricey humongous sandwiched that one person can't possibly eat (but, of course, they charge you to share!) and celebrity photo's on the walls
The food is good - no question - right down to the cheesecake
But why anyone would come here if they weren't a tourist or with a tourist is beyond me
You can get just as good a sandwich and at normal sizes (and prices) elsewhere
That said, great place to take folks from out of town
Great idea: get a corned beef and a pastrami sandwich to go and have a picnic in Central Park
Your guests will love it!
great food
service is average
i have been here several times and never been disappointed - the pastrami sandwich is great as well as their cheesecake
even met adam sandler here once
Tourists and locals shoudl stay away
I have eaten here a few times recently because I work in the neighborhood
The pistrami and corned beef are pure fat and inedible (even when you ask for lean)
The burger, which used to be good a year ago, is 100% gristle
The tuna salad is all mayo, and tasteless
The chicken soup is all bullion, and no chicken
The matzoh balls are tolerable
If this place turns around, I will write back
Otherwise, it is an embarassment to a major establishment and the city, that is clearly taking advantage of the tourist crowd
No wonder there was a triple murder upstairs! They probably were dissastisfied customers
The WORST service ever! Compared to Katz's Deli,, this is a tourist trap serving swill
What a fun place! The sandwiches are so huge you'll be swollen from the salt for days

Over all a nice place to grab a bite to eat
The service is great since it's a small place, you can easily get the waiters attention
This is a great place to grab a quick bite and get real chinese food
Granted, it looks kinda shabby and the seating's kinda squished, but the prices are cheap, the food authentic and filling, and they always have takeout! They speak limited english, but the menu is bilingual so don't worry! I always get cantonese wonton noodle soup here, but the chicken is also almost always good
Sometime's there's a long line, if thats the case, just takeout and sit in Columbus Park
Stewed Noodles With Oyster Sauce  perfect little spot for the best authentic chinese food - don't tell too many people!
Always the best wonton soup, over rice and other dishes
No wonder, I've been loyal to this place for over 10+ years
This is the place for quick hearty food
This is the best place to get a warm bowl of Cantonese wonton noodle soup
There are so many selections to choose from, depending on what you'd like to put in your bowl
Also, their appetizers are very good: chinese vegetables w/ oyster sauce, tofu with special sauce, and Opp Hung with ginger and scallion are among my favorite
I have been going here for years
The restaurant is pretty non-descript, though they renovated recently but the prices are dirt cheap, the food is very yummy, and they're open past midnight
The Scene It's rare to find a New York restaurant space that allows both the spirit and the shoulders room to stretch out and relax, but Capsouto Freres is just such a place
Its exposed-brick walls, huge windows and glossy wood floors provide a soothing but dramatic background
The Food Standby entrees like poached salmon in a green herbal vinaigrette, calf's liver in sherry-vinegar sauce and roast duck form the backbone of the menu
Specials are likely to encompass such exotica as wild Scottish venison and free-range Australian lamb, or seasonal items like springtime's Hudson River shad roe
A creditable cassoulet is available for much of the year
At brunch, omelettes and excellent French toast are on nearly every table, and prices are quite reasonable
I would recommend the restaurant as a lovely romantic and affordable oasis, classic French Bistro with reliable food, and service
My favorite items are the signature Roast Duck with Ginger Cassis Sauce and any of the wonderful souffles for dessert
A very pleasant experience that is unpretentious, comfortable and good for a date or small party
Great food, although there are rare off nights, the service is amazing, with a great ambience, unlike many NYC restaurants, good spacing between tables
Recommended dishes include tuna, filet mignon, duck and hazelnut or any citrus fruit souffle
We love this place and think it is relatively decent value for the quality of the food
The best thing that this restaurant has to offer is itsatmosphere
The decor is beautiful and the facility is spacious (except for the restrooms)
The soufles are very good, but everyting else that my fiance and I had was not extraordinary
In my view, it was not worth the price tag
Also, the service left to be desired
Not once, did the waiter come to ask us how our food was or if we would like anything else
After hearing two stellar reviews, from reliable friends, of Capsouto Freres, I figured that it had to be excellent
While I would say that my experience was good, it was not excellent
The service was very good from the moment that my party walked in, and the atmosphere was very nice (formal without being uncomfortable)
The food however, was only mediocre
To the restaurant's credit, I will say that I did not choose a traditionally French dish for my main course, but my dessert (the chocolate souffle) was only decent as well
If they had an off night and the food generally is much better, the price for a restaurant that gets a 25 is excellent
If not however, you may as well go anywhere that gets a 21, it'll be the same
I went with 2 friends for lunch
The atmosphere is very romantic and French with high ceilings and fresh flowers
Because all of the reviews talked about their souffles, we passed over the prix fixe lunch for souffles
I started with the onion soup which was burnt and not good at all
The mushroom souffle was OK but then again, I was still trying to get the taste of burnt onion soup out of my mouth
We asked the waitor if the souffle was big enough to share and he went on about how people complain how its not big enough- the souffle was big enough to share
The chocolate souffle was light and rich but I've had better
Overall, the price is decent for what you get
We really enjoyed the room more than the food
The Gumnut Babes are still fantasizing about the relaxed, spacious and elegant atmosphere of the Capsouto Freres restaurant
The food is another story altogether We welcomed the experience of the charming waiter to make our menu selections and we were not disappointed
The chance at Escargot as an appetizer and succulent veal, roast duckling and tuna as mains were of amazing quality
However, the most drooling moment was the finale of Hazelnut souffl
Oh my!!!  We would certainly recommend this as an intimate dining experience for people who enjoy peacefulness and excellent food
One can't never image such a good restaurant right off the West side hwy
Lovely and romantic place
Good service
Good food
Most of all, it is spacious
Would love to come for the brunch
Desserts were excellent
Grand space that seems a bit back in time
Lovely big windows and brick walls
Great food and great service
$20 prifix lunch is unbeatable!
My wife loves this place and so do I
Great ambiance and service
The owners are 'hands on', and I like that
Extensive wine list and the food preparation is unmatched
i went there with my coworker for Ny restaurant week last night
it was such a great deal
food portion was too big for girls
the place is very romantic
great for a couple!  they have very friendly and attentive staff
they never annoy you or interrupt your conversation, but always at your table
i want to go back in the summer
(i think they will have tables outside when it's warm) oh, they carry good wines too
very important
I had dinner here not too long ago with two friends and we all really enjoyed our meal
The space is beautiful, all three dinners were excellent and the staff was friendly
Not on a par with Montrachet or Le Bernadin, but great value for the money!
Thank you again Capsouto family for a wonderful dinner
Tonight was my husband's birthday, and we went for a wonderful dinner
We passed the beautiful bar and decided to stop for a drink, a let's unwind drink before dinner
It was an UNWIND FROM MIDTOWN time and it was wonderful! I love Tribeca and dosntown NYC!  Dinner was super scrumption
Supberb salad and  the best Chicken in tangerine sauce I have ever had
A raspberry dessert souffle ( it was huge) and a coffee
A wonderul relaxing ( they don't kick you out quick) dinner and birthdya celebration
The lovely ambience at Capsouto Freres is second to none
The food is spectacular and the service top notch
There is no better restaurant in Tribeca
When the bill arrives, you will also be pleasantly surpsrised!
Excellent food - consistently
Worth every cent
And quiet enough to enjoy the conversation of your company throughout the whole experience as well
Not a scene - more a staple classic
The last time I dined at Capsouto Frres was 15 years ago
I'm glad to have returned and sorry it wasn't sooner
My party of 4 had a wonderful dinner, from cocktails through dessert
Service was excellent with Messr
Capsouto even running out in a thunderstorm to hail a cab for us

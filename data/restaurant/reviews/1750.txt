The staff was cool, there was even a cool celeb hanging nonchalantly in a corner table
What a great New York experience!!!
Dirty, crowded, over-worked wait staff
the food looks very, very scary! Otherwise, the drinks were tasty
sure, the margaritas are good, but those poor waitresses! This restaurant gets too busy for its own good
The waitresses try their hardest, but it is just bad management
The food takes forever, the nachos get burned and dont get the fish! youre better off going to the mexican restaurant across the street
It's a shame my first time here was tainted by bad service, because this is a great place to come with friends
The food was great and the margaritas were as good as everyone says, but both the hostess and the waitress were appalling
the hostess really underestimated the wait time for outdoor seating and never apologized, and our waitress was apathetic and unattentive
we waited 45 minutes for our food and before we even got it, she asked if we'd want anything else because the kitchen was closing (and when we asked if dessert was possible, she said no!)
i would come back, but i would avoid the tall skinny Pam-from-The-Office-esque waitress
The watermelon margaritas are out of this world! The on the rocks and frozen are equally amazing
The steak quesadilla is a really good deal
lots of meat and very filling
Def better for a group to share pitchers of margarita
not so much a date place
I was shocked when from the second I entered El Rey Del Sol, I felt like the hostess wanted us to leave
She refused to explain to us why we couldn't sit at an obviously open table
She proceeded to seat the next group who came in and glared at us as she sat them
It was the most bizarre thing we'd all experienced
We were about the leave when a nice waitress explained to us that she'd personally seat us when she witnessed the hostess' actions
While everyone else was wonderful, it was the food and margaritas that eventually dulled the bitter experience in the beginning
Both were GREAT!!!! I'd recommend a personnel change
No one wants to start their night off that way
The art on the walls is very expressive of Mexican culture
And it is varied
one can spend a few minutes looking at the different kinds of pieces that have been assembled
The food is great
I recommened the tortilla chip appetizer-it comes loaded with flavor and make note that it has a jalepeno slice on each tortilla
The main course was plentiful--a typical beef burritto order resulted in an oversized meal
Not the taco bell-like buritto at all! There are also meals for the health conscious
those that are low in cholesterol, etc
Drinks are strong too, and many beverages are served in long highball-like glasses
Bring a party or bring a date
even bring those who aren't familiar to trying new foods
I'm convinced that almost anyone can appreciate the spot
I love El Rey Del Sol! The margaritas are fresh and perfect
The food consistantly good
My friends and I love this place where we enjoy our tex/mex favorites: fajitas grilled to perfection, crispy flautas, great guacamole and a new favorite steak quesadillas
The place is truly quirky, but that's the fun of it
The garden area is the perfect spot for welcoming in Spring with a pitcher of margaritas and some Mexican snack foods like chips and salsa or quesadillas
The food was good- prices were reasonable and unlike many spaces with out door seating you CAN make reservations for the garden area
Service was a little haphazard but I think we were too early for the official wait staff
Once I tasted sushi at Zutto, I couldn't eat it anywhere else
Nothing tasted as fresh or flavorful
The rest of the menu is as wonderful and authentic
The establishment is very welcoming, and the dinner is relaxed
There's an upstairs room for more intimate dining
The service is terrific
This is one of those restaurants who are 'truly' Japanese owned and operated
The sushi chef is excellent and always has the freshest and most delicate cuts of fish
The 'chirashi' is always predictable and a great assortment of sashimi
Great atmosphere, service always friendly as well
We have 'walked-in' on a weekend night and have always gotten a table
Clearly, people have not caught on yet so enjoy before it gets crowded!
I've never tried great sashimi rolls ever
Such as Bull's Eye roll (Tuna/Toro/asparagus with original dressing), Casabranca sashimi (Amazing white tuna with original dressing), Velvety Eel rolls (eel/papaya/cucumber) and more
to say No soy sauce need!   Woops, don't forget to try special cocktails sashimi as well!  Also, sushirolls and apetizer are yammy
Never tried Salmon toro sushi, Spider woman roll (softshell/masago)
more  There is good atmosphere on 2nd floor for 4 people and more
I finally found a really good sushi restaurant that was reasonably priced and did not feel rushed or overcrowded
The sushi was extremely fresh(compares favorably to Yama), there was an extensive sake menu, and the service was very prompt and efficient
The atmosphere was a liitle more restaurant than sushi joint which is a plus, and there was plenty of room between tables
We were able to linger at our table to enjoy another glass of sake and some conversation without feeling rushed, and the bill was very reasonable
I highly recommend Zutto
lots of creative rolls, really fresh sushi, and full Japanese menu
The Scene  This laid-back, flying-themed restaurant/lounge constantly bustles with 20-somethings, while the cozy back dining room attracts groups of after-work revelers looking for cheap drinks and excellent eats
The airplane decor includes photos of vintage aircraft, a large suspended model plane, a WPA-looking mural and even authentic salvaged plane parts
The Food  Most dishes are fresh and fabulous
This isn't just bar food: In addition to chicken fingers and french fries, enjoy succulent steak, creamy mashed potatoes, a variety of pasta dishes and cappuccino
There's plenty to entertain while you wait for a meal: Draw on the table with crayons, play video games up front, or read the "story" of Flight 151 which involves Nazis and spicy chili
I love this place
I went to this place for the first over 10 years ago, I can't say I am a regular but I do stop by every time I am in the neighborhood and always love it
This is the last of the REAL New York Bar Grills
Very friendly (no attitude) staff; Cheap prices and very good food
You would not expect a bar to have such GOOD FOOD or a place with such good food to have such A COOL BAR
after the halloween parade, a group of us stumbled into flight for some after-parade revelry
the bar staff were amazing and provided refreshing bursts of comedy and quality service
did not expect a burger joint to be this cool and swank
i'll be back
I went to this bar totally by accident on a late tuesday night around 10pm with a couple of friends
We went in because their sign said that they were having flip night (bartender flips a coin, if you guess right, you get a free drink)
There weren't too many people at the bar, but there were enough of us to have a good time at this place
We won some free drinks, used crayons on our table, and played their video games
We didn't order any food
Go with a lot of friends, and make your own fun at this theme night relaxed attitude bar
To me, it seems to be a better place for drinking and hanging out than for dining
I love this place! Great food for low prices and really fun deals (i
e
Tuesday's flip night, where you have a 50-50 chance of getting your beer for free!) Good brunch too!
The Scene Linens cover tables, yet half of the diners are sporting jeans; it's this comfortable balance that keeps couples on dates and friends grabbing a bite so endurlingly loyal
Wine, well-built cocktails and cut radishes dipped in salt--clever bar snacks--attract solo diners and friends catching up to the bar
Service is smooth, warm and effortlessly capable
The Food It's rare to find a neighborhood restaurant where the cooking is this good from start to finish
Roast quail arrives with an addictive mix of sausage, mushrooms and raisins in a lovely tomato jus; decadent foie gras is countered by the mellowed tartness of sauteed grapes
Though the menu is brief, entrees range from a deeply satisfying, wintry seared calf's liver with oven-dried tomatoes to a much lighter striped bass drizzled with textbook perfect beurre blanc
Almond milk panna cotta finishes with aplomb, but the banana split gets the biggest smiles
Delicious food, attentive service, and perfect ambiance!!! What more can you possibly want from a restaurant?!?! My friends and I were treated like royalty even without a reservation
Everything from the appetizers, to the main course, to the desserts were worthy of endless praise

And they are all amazing! My favourites are the Wazah (crispy waffles with fruit and a brulee topping), the Very Berry Brioche French Toast, the Red Berry Risotto (oatmeal), and the Lobster and Asparagus omlette
Weekend brunch is very busy, but I've never waited more than 20 minutes
When I've gone during the week, I've never waited for a table
The service has been consistently good- they always seem to know what you need and when
I hope this place stays around for a long time!
I have been going to Nocello for the last 8 years
Their food always impresses and their service is amazing
Penne Ala Vodka is unbelievable - best I have ever had! Wine selection and desserts are also notable
Went during lunch, casual relaxed atmosphere, service was friendly, and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals
They did not offer any low carb options aside from a traditional salad
All of the chicken/fish dishes were covered in sauce or breaded
I would recommend Nocello to pasta lovers - but not for those on Atkins or the South Beach Diet
This place is fantastic! The staff really makes you feel at home
very personable, attentive, yet not overbearing
I've tried 5 different dishes here, and they've all been tremendous, but the Rigatoni ala Vodka is literally the best pasta dish I've ever had!
My friend and I were walking around after seeing Mama Mia, and stumbled across Nocello
We were delighted with everything! The pasta was really al dente, and the wait staff was attentive and accomadating
It was a perfect end to a wonderful day
I am taking my mother here after our visit to the city
I can't wait to hear her rave! Best of all, for two of us with drinks, the bill was about $100!!! Talk about incredible
Can't wait to go back
Recently had dinner on a saturday night with party of 7
Everything from making the reservation to birthday desserts to paying the check was a pleasure
Constantino and his entire staff were attentive, warm and friendly
The food was hot, tasty, well prepared and unique in a traditional way
No sundried tomatoes or out-there ingredients
Just great food with flair served by nice people
Service was a little relaxed but we were not in a rush (they did ask)
TRY IT YOULL LIKE IT
Recently we had dinner at Nocello - eight people on a Saturday night and we had no problem with getting a reservation, the atmosphere was lovely, the service was excellent and the food was excellent - all at a very very good overall price
Between the eight of us all had a dinner, some had appetizers, some dessert, some drinks, some wine, some after dinner drinks and cappucino and the bill was around $45
00 per person
Fantastic!!!! We will definitely go back to this wonderful find!!!!!
There's nothing to rave about this place
Just a small cozy place to have really good indian food at reasonable prices
Went there for lunch and will definitely go back again
The service nice as well
This is a great place for a lunchtime slice as evidenced by lines out of the door but service is fast
Far superior pizza to other establishment in the neighborhood
Undercooked pizza and very uninspired pasta with tomato sauce (i
e
some store-bought ones are tastier) combined with, at times, slow service didn't make for a good dining experience
Would not go there again
The food wasn't as great as I'd expected
I had a few slices of cheese pizza
There's definitely better places to go in New York than this, but the value was pretty good and it was quick
My eggplant parmigana was very good and the past was very fresh
My firends lemon sole smelled and tasted funny
the garlic knots were a little well done, and there was no butter on the bread
I was hoping that we would actully get plastic cups, but we were served in paper cups and straws
Nice for a quick bite, stick witht he pasta!
We had dinner here on Dec
27
We were seated promptly and treated very well by the staff
The food was excellent and a great value
I highly recommend this restaurant
what a wonderful meal and service couldn't be beat
We took our children and their families for dinner in the city and wanted to keep it reasonable,couldn't ask for more, the food was great and plenty of it
We will deffinity go back
We all left with a smile on our face and our bellies full
The food and location were superb
I ate before I took in a show
I enjoyed the delicious chicken parmigiana and my kids had individual pizzas
The service was great and the waiter was very friendly
I would definetely come again
Having time to spare before going to the Neil Simon Theatre, we found the Russian Samovar close by
What good luck! Small enough to feel intimate, large enough for variety, but heavily patronized by Russians - the language was predominant
Wonderful, real food - lots of protein, seriously delicious
Watch out for the flavored vodkas - you'll want to try them all


and they have quite a few
Thing I learned: singers will expect $20 bill per song to the jar on the piano, - ask for the singer you want
Spend a while watching and listening and you'll get the idea
Despite being in tourist mecca of theatres it draws a large contingent of Russians of all generations and so feels like a local 'pub' - for Russians
Just let them do their thing - and don't try to be Russian if you aren't
Great, great fun!!
I had dinner at the Samovar the other night
The experience could not have been better
The place is beautiful, the service is courteous and effective, and the food is outstanding
I had the rabbit and my companion had the lamb for entrees
We were both very happy with them
My companion had the cold borsch for an appetizer and was very satisfied
I had the vinegret, and thought it was pretty good but not as nice as everything else at the restaurant
Overall, the night was a success and the bill was $100 for two (appetizers, entrees, glass of wine each, tea/coffee)
I got into town Friday a little late (10pm) and had to find a place to eat
now I know why NY is such a great city
This spot was awesome
Outstanding service, great food , vodka menu
and GREAT crowd
and live russian and int
music There I met poets, artists and ordinary people Just enough of an edge to let you know youare in NYC, but none of the trouble with a hot restaurant
Special thanks to the owner Roman Kaplan and my waiter Chris
Highly recommended
Good russian food outside the home is hard to come by
RUssian restuarants are more about getting big groups together, getting drunk, and having a blast
I had a good time and the vibe was very jovial, but the food was pricey and less than fresh
downstairs was lively, upstairs was overly extravagant, big and empty
go with good people, and not to be blown away by cuisine
Great place to go for a chang of the norm! Took my friends after a show

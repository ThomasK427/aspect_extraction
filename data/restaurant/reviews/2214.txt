Yet because of the Old World atmosphere and the friendly bustling waitstaff, I'm always too glad to wait
Be sure to order a cup of Turkish coffee at the end
Everytime I go to New York I have to stop at Luigi's
It's definitley one of New York's underrated places
It's the best pizza I've ever gotten in New York
We literally stumbled on Luigi's trying to find the Letterman Studio's
This was our first meal in New York and hands down was the best pizza find of them all
We tried all the pizza places locals and books recommended, but none could touch Luigi's
The staff were not very friendly, but with food like that, who cares! It's worth going back to New York just for their pizza!
This place is a real find
Although you may have to wait for a seat, the genuine Italian food is well worth the wait
The portions are large, and can be easily split between 2 or more people
Luigi's is a real value and a true find for midtown
Prices are way too high for take out
$10
25 for Chicken Parm Dinner that was horrible and you can get better in the hood for $7
25
However, they have the best garlic knots in Manhattan
A pizzeria with relatively plain decor and too few tables (good luck getting a seat anywhere around 1PM on a weekday
)
This does not detract from the food, which so far has been great! The pizza is decent, but their modestly priced chicken salad is to die for
Get the small size and save a buck, since the large really doesn't give you a much bigger portion
Very pleased with this place
Kinda miss not working nearby and being part of the regular lunch crowd
My boyfriend and I have been coming to this elegant and comfortable spot at least once a week for over a year now
Although I can't vouch for many other dishes on the menu (as I haven't tried many because I can't keep away from the sushi), I can tell you that the sushi has never disappointed
They have phenomenal creations that just melt in your mouth (like the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Crunchy)
The chef will also make rolls not listed on the menu at your request
The service is always friendly, and the experience will leave you craving for sushi every week
My friends and I always go to Fuji for birthday celebrations
The servers are very friendly and the food is wonderful
I have very fond memories in this restaurant
I love Fuji - we eat here quite often for both lunch and dinner
Lunchtime is a record biz crowd from the Universal labels across the street
56th right here is loud and noisy due to construction - you open the door to Fuji andwalk into a quiet, tranquil, and beautiful traditional Japanese restaurant----  I love Sashami so: It is always fresh - the Tuna is just so good sometimes and I can't stop ordering more
My wife loves the sushi , the apps are also good
Friendly service - don't tell too many people please :)
HALE AND HEARTY is by far my favorite place for lunch
the soups taste great, and they tell you which ones are lowfat, dairy free, and veg
the tossed salads are amazing as well
it can be a little pricey but it is worth every penny!
The Scene The "Arte" at this teeming Italian triumph is represented by giant sketches of proboscises and other (R-rated) body parts, set off by brash walls of yellow and aquamarine
Typical of owner Shelly Fireman (he also owns Redeye Grill on the same block), the tables are neighborly, the lights unforgiving and the noise level, at times, numbing
Upbeat and capable servers add to the festive scene
The Food On this Mediterranean menu, don't miss the carciofi alla Giudea--fried baby artichokes with parchment-thin crispy leaves
Pastas are as imaginative as they are irresistible, especially the ricotta dumplings with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe
Seafood and meats, most simply prepared, are equally good: grilled swordfish with capers, olives and tomatoes, and perfectly roasted halibut with homey scalloped potatoes
Solo diners or those in a rush can perch at the spectacular antipasti bar piled high with more than 20 selections, most all of them satisfying
From the second I walked into Trattoria Del Arte I felt welcome
The very stylish and charismatic matrade greeted us with such enthusiasm I could have sworn he new us! (Later I found out his name is Brandon
Make sure to ask to him! He's a doll!) Once seated I had the most amazing fried artichokes, eggplant rollatini, and tuna steak! Everything was extremely fresh, and with the extensive choice of wines, I could never try them all
Plus our waiter kept us laughing the entire meal
Now I've lived in New York my whole life, and have never found a restaurant that makes me feel so welcome! Keep up the good work Trattoria!!!!!!!
I have eaten regularly at Trattoria dell' Arte for over 5 years
Usually I sit at the bar, but I have also dined at tables
It's a shame a few of the other reviewers had a disappointing experience at this restaurant but realistically there's no restaurant that can please everyone all the time
It's true this place can get VERY loud, especially on fall-winter-spring weekends before 8pm showtimes and I have seen lines stretch out the front door
The bar is extremely friendly and a great place to chat with other patrons
There is seating galore (including outside, upstairs and two private rooms downstairs!)
There is a fantasic Antipasto Bar with an incredible variety of delicious, fresh vegetables, seafood, etc
Their cracker-thin pizzas are the best I've had
The Tordelli with bolognese sauce is wonderful and my latest must have dish
I've eaten most of the menu and have not been disappointed
True, it is not a cheap eats place but I do think you get a good value for the quality of food served
I have to say that this restaurant is the top of the line in NYC
I get so frustrated when I go out, I can NEVER find a restaurant that has GREAT food and AWESOME service
This is the place! Can you tell me another restaurant that is inviting and makes you feel like your at home? Can you tell me of a restaurant that passes out trays of cookies, chocolates sparkling wine
FOR FREE! Well if you can Iwould love to know
Until then I am going to continue to visit Trattoria Dell Arte!
I don't know what these people or talking about, unless you have to know someone to get good service, I absolutely have no complaints about this place! Yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect from its location? I have had only the best at this place and the cannoli's are to die for
Ask for George, he'll take care of you!
The service is lacking, the tables are too close together, and the food is just okay at this teflon oldie, which despite these drawbacks seems to get good reviews
I suppose its location, just across from Carnegie Hall and the NY City Center, is a plus, but neither the food nor the decor (perhaps titillating in the 80s but old hat now) nor the service (ranging from diffident to obsequious) justifies its rating or the prices they charge
It is impossible to have a conversation without adjacent tables overhearing everything you say
Went to this restaurant with a group of friends and had the worst service
The waiter forgot many orders and argued with guests
Besides having an attitute and being very rude to us he also messed up the bill
Would never go back!
This place came recommended by the concierge at our hotel
The food was just average
The atmosphere was not bad but the food was just sub par
Maybe it was an off night, maybe not
We were looking forward to a good meal too
While they boast loud atmosphere, to my disappointment, while out at a corporate dinner, my group was asked to be quiet at the request of a dining couple
This, after our bill had well exceded $2,000
00! If a quiet environment is what they strive for, then they should advertise the ambience quite differently
I certainly will not be recommending Trattoria Dell' Arte to colleagues in the future
Where the food was good, the overall experience could have been alot better
If yuppies want quietude, then Italian really isn't your thing
But the restaurant staff should know better than to contradict their own credo
I don't know what happened to this place, the last coupel of times i have been there just turned me off
I sat for dinner by myself, had an appetizer, 1 entree and drinks - with tip my bill was exactly $100 dollars
This place, although decent, is definitely not deserving of these prices
I could not also believe how loud it was
It is honestly one of the loudest places i have ever been to in NY
Can't say i would want to go back any time soon
Defenitely felt rushed as well
I have been here several times with friends and family and have never left unhappy
The ultra thin crust pizza is a great starter, I loved the wild boar pasta, and the fish dishes have all been very good
The outdoor seating is also a nice plus

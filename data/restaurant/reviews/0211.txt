I had the spagetti carbonara which was OK, just a bit too oniony
We wrapped it up with Apple Streudel and cinnamon ice cream which was excellent
The service was great
They were always there exactly when we needed them, without being interefering
And now that I've seen the wine cellar that it has, I am definitely going to remember it for private parties
In summary, great food, relaxed atmosphere, no New York attitude
The Scene Though the interior is relatively open and modern, Rothmann's appeal still comes across as a big-money, masculine one
Men in suits smoke cigars at the sidewalk cafe, while perky women talk on cell phones
A happening bar scene rages in the background
The Food This restaurant's overall approach to steakhouse fare is safe to the point of conservatism--appetizers include smoked halibut with asparagus and baby greens, crabmeat cocktail, and oyster and corn chowder
In the steak realm, choices include juicy sirloin, filet mignon and rib steaks, along with colossal strip steaks designed for sharing
There is nothing lacking from this establishment other than the stuffiness that comes with an established name in the market
The staff are very attentive, the wine list is extraordinary (allowing for all wallet sizes from the 30$ to the 2000$ bottle), the sides are great and can serve a small party, the steaks
oh the steaks! Thier sommelier is knowledgeable, as are the waitors
The bar is a great networking location
The decor is a modern take on the traditional steakhouse
Rothmann's is pleasing in every aspect!  As a side note, just down the block you can find (since NY is a non-smoking city anymore) a Davidoff of Geneva to get your after dinner smoke (which you might want to do early before they close)
It is just off of 5th Ave
I have to admit Ive been to alot of steakhouses and Rothmann's I can say is one of the best Steakhouses I've been to
The steak is excellent, the service is outstanding, and the wine list is neverending
But overall the staff, management, cooks, and everyone else has attended to all of my needs except rubbing my feet
So I highly recommend this steakhouse to all
We stopped here on a whim while walking around NYC
The staff were courteous, the atmosphere was pleasant, and most of all, the food was FANTASTIC! The portions were a little gigantic (I can't eat a 16oz steak on a good day!), but other than that, excellent
Oh, and an excellent Cosmo
This place has good steak
If you tried all the other steak houses in the city and want to add another one to the list of top steakhouses, I recommend it
However service was a bit disappointing
It didn't run evenly with ambience and food quality
I would first make sure you've been to Ruth Chris, Lugers, Angelo Maxies, Bobby vans, S W, the Palm Mortons first
I think Rothmans rates along the lines of Old Homestead, Nick Stefs, the Post house
I still need to try Sparks Dylan Prime
I love this place
you are all crazy
The steak rocks and the sides are great
All cuts, creamed spinach, potato croquettes and wine galore! Sides are important to me when eating a steak!
Food was tasty, but nothing extraordinary
When the check came, they almost needed to give me oxygen- $300 for 4 and that was just basic dinner and a drink apiece
I had the crabcakes- decent, but on the dry side and a little burned
2 of my dinner companions had steak which they reported to be very good and my other friend had sea bass, which she said was extremely salty
Overall, staff was very friendly and we did have a nice time
Ate here the first night in New York
The service was absolutely wonderful
They were very, very attentive and very patient when we were not sure what we wanted
All my daughter had to do was comment on a certain bread they served and the waiter produced more for her to take with her
My husband's steak was very tender and my soup and Rothmann's salad was very tasty
Steaks were acceptable but not great, aervice was acceptable but not great, drinks were good
I would call it a steakhouse for visiting businessmen and their wives
In Short Tiny tables packed into a cozy dining room on a residential street are frequented by the Slope fine-dining trinity: parents who've left the kid home with the babysitter, chic gay and lesbian couples and the usual hipsters
Seasonal and organic ingredients are used to create garden-fresh meals
Dishes intensified with lovage, parsley-based salads, and appetizers served with pungent pickling sauces all contribute
Last time we were there we had the wine-pairing menu and dined with glorious abandon from about 6:45 to 10PM
Granted, it was a night of urban flooding but the service was spot on, the meal was incredible and the wines were so perfectly paired that for the first time, I wished I had taken the wine list with me to seek them out post meal
The menu varies with the season, but I would recommend at any time
I'm nervous to write this, but the last experience was not unlike the extreme pleasure I found in the wine-paired tasting menu at Gramercy Park Tavern
Really a lovely place with amazing food
The menu is creative and impressive and elegant, but the vibe is very casual and laid back
Tiny space, but charming and romantic
A great date place, not for a group of friends
The service is spotty, but always friendly
Entrees are about $20, and there's a few good wines on the menu for about $30/bottle
I have been to this restaurant many times, and every time has been pure bliss
There is such attention to detail and warmth from the owner, and the food feels like it's prepared with love
Speaking of the food, it is delicious, my friends all come out from Manhattan to go here-many think it is the best meal they have had in New York
Go!
Brunch is really delicious here! One of my favorites! But you usually have to wait a good while (30 min)
Definitely one of my fav places in Park Slope for brunch
My wife and I have been going to Rose Water since it first opened and it instantly became our favorite
We have brought everyone we know and have yet to have a single negative experience, or even witness it with other patrons
[OK, one friend thought his extra-rare hanger steak wasn't hot enough, but if it was it wouldn't have been rare
] Clearly the menu is different and even exotic, so not everyone will appreciate it as evidenced here
The staff is amazing
Every server is helpful, friendly and genuinely invested in ensuring that you have a wonderful experience
The host knows more about wine (and mead and beer) than any somelier I have met
The reviews contradict each other, and I'm ambivalent, too
The vibe, welcome, and service are awesome, and the menu is intriguing, but in the end the food is just not so
The chef is ambitious with his combinations, but they don't always work
Despite the promise of healthfulness implied by the use of organic ingredients, most dishes seem to have a greasiness about them
The starter courses (recently 3 squash tortellini with well-balanced seasoning and a bit of chestnut) tend to outshine the main courses (a whole fish that looked floppy and squishy and tasted like a lake, served with squash and mushrooms, which were mismatched in texture and flavor)
And yet I keep going back
The service, joviality of the host and fellow patrons, and the wine list make this place work
We'll be trying brunch soon
I hope that the chef will take reviews constructively
My fave spot in the hood
Food from the farm
Menu and wine list that challenge instead of stoop
Low-key but spot-on service
Still the best in the Slope for my money
I wanted to like this restaurant
Nice location, nicely decorated, warm and homey
Actually too warm and cosy - this was a hot June night and there was no air-conditioning! Very uncomfortable
Menu is extremely fussy with very strange mixtures
My chicken was certainly moist but was it really necessary or desirable to serve it with clams and lamb and some unrecognizable root vegetable
? My husband had the cod - one of the smallest portions of what should be an affordable fish
Salad was ok, but again super fussy
Dessert was dreadful - strawberry rubarb thing
Service was certainly pleasant and you can tell they are trying, but I would say simplify the menu and lay off the pretense
COLD FOOD CAME OUT SLOWLY
CHARGEDE TOO MUCH FOR FRINKS
Rosewater is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn

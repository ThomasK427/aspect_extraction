Plus, for an extra $6 they'll specially pair a glass of wine with your meal choices
I love this restaurant, but what I really love is sitting in the rear at the open kitchen bar, and watching the crew do thier thing
Right out of Kitchen Confidential you'll see Chef Morgan run a tight, strict, but friendly operation, and turn out hundreds of meals right before your eyes, all while you eat your meal
It's a little like a sushi bar, except your field of vision is much, much larger
You can watch the Grill Man, and all the others as well, and from time to time you'll the see Morgan or one of the number one's have the staff re-do a meal or a piece of a meal, since they are perfectionists
I really do love this place, it's food, and yeah it earns it's 10 full on
The Scene Much of the crowd has been loving Jerry's since its 1987 inception, but that doesn't mean they don't still look fabulous
Colorful local artists rub shoulders at the back bar, and couples--even families--eat against a backdrop of art that includes celeb portraits of Mic Jagger and Jerry Garcia
Diner-chic done right includes vintage floor tiles, fire engine-red booths, chrome accents, and distinctive zebra stripes
The Food Chef Eric Korsh helms the internationally influenced American menu that manages an octopus salad tossed with a light lemon-parsley dressing as adeptly as crispy calamari
You could order the burger on a savory onion roll--and if you do, upgrade to fries drizzled with white truffle oil--but the charred skirt steak puts many a bistro's to shame
Spaghettini alla turino seems forgettable in this terrain, which brings items more fit for a haute menu--like the braised short ribs, dripping in a thick sweet sauce and sided by creamy polenta
The atmosphere is fabulous
The service impeccible
The portion size - disappointing
I paid $14 for TWO scallops
Yes, 2 scallops
It was an appetizer, but nonetheless, I felt humiliated when the waitress placed the plate in front of me
I love eating at this place and I am so glad to see the big Jerry's flag is still there as I drive down the street
The service thankfully gets better and better each year
There is always a wait for lunch, but well worth it
Although, I have to admit, I wish the specials were a bit more interesting
Nevertheless, try the burger or calamari salad-delicious!
Wow, this restaurant has come back from the dark ages
I decided to give this restaurant another shot and I'm glad I did
What a Big change from 8 years ago
Not only did I get to see the general manager spring into action and save Mira Sorvino's baby from choking on a piece of bread, (talk about taking control and being prepared!) I had great service and the greatest BLT
The walls went from barren to covered with cool pieces of art from well known photographers and boring red banquettes to fun vibrant pony print
No wonder all the celebrities eat there
I certainly will be back
Jerry's is one of those rare places in Soho that is an institution
The food is great, service always friendly and the price sure is right
There's something for everyone and there are always some famous faces around
There are a lot of regulars so it's fun to hang out
Great bar crowd early in the evening
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
I am very surprised to see a few negative ratings
This restaurant is in my neighborhood so I frequent this establisment very often
It is great because seating is always promt
The place is unpretentious and comfortable
depending where I am coming from or going to, I have been there both extremely dressed up and very casual
This is why it feels like home
There are a many dishes you can always count on and the staff treats you like family
And ofcourse the food is always superb !!!!
My wife and I dined at Jerry's Thursday night and I have to admit at first we were skeptical, but from the moment we walked in we felt as if we were guests in someones house
We informed the host that it was our first time eating at Jerry's
He smiled, gave us a brief history of the restaurant and assured us we would have a great time
He was right
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed
I recommend the baby chicken with sweet onions
Needless to say, we will be going back to this trendy eatery very soon
I just got back from brunch at this place
I really wasn't impressed
The food was very average, and overly priced for what you got
I ordered an omellette which wasn't any better than I could make at home (or get in any mom and pop diner)
It costs $12
My wife ordered french toast which was better than my dish, but still nothing to write home about
I was really more in a lunch mood anyway, but the thought of paying $14 for a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato just doesn't seem right
The ambience, which isn't a huge deciding factor for me anyway, was that of a slightly upscale diner - nothing more
Bottom line: With so many good alternatives in the area, we will not be heading back to this place
I was at Jerry's a few nights ago and had a great time
I absolutely loved the jicama and shrimp appetizer, and the hand-rolled pasta with olive oil and tomatoes was excellent
The service was friendly and attentive, and you can tell that there are a lot of regulars who have been going there for years, which makes Jerry's a unique spot in a neighborhood that is known for its pretentious restaurants that come and go every year
Lunchs are very busy so I suggest you get their early
Dinner was incredible
Those risotto cakes are fabulous and the Jicama salad excellent
There is a gorgeous female Eurasian manager who is incredibly accomdating
my favorite thing about Jerry's is the variety of food selections which is excellent and this really pleases most people who seem to never agree on one thing
the soups are really amazing here and the food is pretty genuniely fine
even the desserts, we are always satisfied when we go here no matter what
the atmosphere is that of a diner, but if you get a booth that is the best! I saw John Turturro there once! give it a try for lunch!
who is the hot bartender who works wednesday afternoons? i was there a few weeks ago and saw him - dark hair, nice looks :) he wasn't the only good thing about the restaurant
good food, friendly waiters, nice atmosphere
i recommend it
I went to Jerry's on Saturday night
The manager greeted me at the door and talked to me and my husband at out table for 5 minutes
Our waitress (a female) was excellent and the food was so good
and after dinner the manager came back to ask us how we liked everything
This is a great place with great customer service
I will be coming back to Jerry's
Jerry's is a great place where the food is always good
I had the Pan Seared Cod Fish and it was melt in my mouth delicious
Two others had the Skirt Steak and both were very pleased and our third diner had the Risotto and thought it was the best he'd ever had
I would recommend Jerry's to anyone who wants a good meal for a reasonable price in NYC from a place that's clean and welcoming
I discovered Jerry's about a year ago, and it has become my favorite place in Soho
The food is excellent, portions are generous and the atmosphere is fun
The desserts are to die for! Best of all you get all this at a fair price with great service! I would definitely recommend a visit to Jerry's if your in the neighborhood
I dined at jerry's after a movie at the angelika theater and had a wonderful first date here
I had the filet mignon special with brandy cream sauce and mashed potatoes
it was outstanding and my date had an arugula sald and pizza
You can eat somethign decadent here or just something light
The service was outstanding and our waitress made us laugh and feel very comfortable
The coffee martini was also very good
(we had two each) If you want to hang out in soho and not feel like you are in a snooby place
this is the restaurant for you
I'll be going back there soon!
Year after year I am amazed at the poor reviews Jerrys receives in Zagat and Time Out NY
I have been here nearly a dozen times for dinner and lunch and have never been disappointed
The food is excellent, especially for the price
I highly recommend the Roast Chicken as an entree and the creme brulee desert

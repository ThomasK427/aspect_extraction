PRIVITE DINNING WAS EXCELLENT!
I took a friend out for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful time! The food was amazingly good - fresh oysters for appetizers, juicy dry aged steaks for entrees (we both agreed it was one of the best we've ever had) and delicious desserts! The restaurant itself is stunning, very good for group dining and perfect for a romantic date
We came in half an hour earlier than our reservation on a weekend, and they were able to seat us promptly
The staff is also very friendly and helpful
The prices are pretty reasonable compared to other fancy restaurants, it is worth every penny
Will definitely go back there again!
I've dined at The Capital Grill in Manhattan twice and numerous times at the Boston restaurant
Last night we celebrated my son's 26th birthday with dinner in NYC
Our reservation was promptly honored even though we arrived a little late
The ambiance is masculine luxurious and very comfortable
We all had salads and steak acompanied with luscious mashed potatoes and delectable creamed spinach
The porcini rubbed delmonico is heavenly and the sirloins were excellent
The wine selection is great
My son and daughter enjoyed the wonderful martinis while waiting for my wife and I to arrive
Service was very attentive and professional
There is no getting around the fact that the meal is pricey but considering the quality of food and service and the costs at competing steakhouses, I consider it a reasonable value for a fine dining experience
The experience is always fantastic at The Capital Grille
The steak never disappoints and the service is always top notch
This is for me the best porterhouse in NYC and maybe the US at a great price
Always consistent and full of flavor, the steak here blows away other traditional steakhouses that pass out fatty hunks of meat as prime cuts! Who are they kidding?  Come to the Capital Grille and you will never get a bad cut of beef
I went here for my one year anniversary and it was great! They honored my reservation request for a booth and sat us immediately
Our waitress Karen was the best
She was knowledgable about the various wines and was always around when I had to ask for something
The thick cut steaks came out perfect (not overcooked) and were filled with flavors
Overall, it was a pleasant experience!
Philip Johnson architecture with Dry-aged beef and hard to find wines make this spot awesome
The staff has great hospitality!
The Capital Grille has one of the more impressive dining rooms I have ever seen
Aside from the ambiance and beautiful surroundings, the food is superb and the service is friendly, yet professional
I ate at this restaurant last night with a group of friends
First of all, It is in a nasty, dirty part of town
As we walked in, the music was so loud that we couln not even have a conversation
They were playing rap music with explicit language
The service was very slow, and the food was horrible
The staff was not friendly or accommodating at all
Rest assured I will not be eating there again
Do yourself a favor and skip it!
No steam in this engine
would have thought a new engine would be firing on all cylinders
This one has poor machinery, poor engineers and very poor drivers
Coal is soo expensive that i would rather get it elsewhere
Four of us had dinner at Bette last night and had a great experience! We met at the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail before our 7:30 reservation
We enjoyed our drinks and conversation and took our time- we didn't ask to be seated until 7:45 - which wasn't a problem
The service was very professional and prompt
The menu has quite a price range - $17 - $40's for entrees
I had salmon which I was thrilled with!! The scallop au gratin appetizer was very good - rich, but perfect if shared
The restaurant filled up by 8:30 - there was a good buzz to the room - it was crowded, but we didn't feel rushed to finish or our table service delayed
We all enjoyed the evening!
I went there with a friend for afternoon tea service on a Sunday
The restaurant is beautiful and the service was great (granted we were practially the only people there)
The tea service is amazing: the tea is sublime and so are the desserts and finger sandwiches
And everything is 'all you can eat', which makes it an even better deal
A great experience overall
I loved it! Service, scene, decor, the most surprising thing for me was the food
I had heard mixed things but the sole was fantastic as were the short ribs
Go when you are feeling gorgeous and want to spoil yourselves
What a crowd! The night I went I saw Linda Evangelista and Jay McInerney
Everyone was chic and oh so put together
The food was outstanding, The scallops, Lamb, Whole Branzino all fantastic
Very good wines too
I highly recomment Bette for anyone looking for Style and Substance
My friends and I went to Bette last saturday night, we are used to places like Tao, Asiade Cuba, Nobu Dylan Prime, to name a few
Meaning we go out to some of the best places in NYC all the time
Bette is not one of them, first of all it's very small and not at all sexy or even plesant
The service was horrible I have never seen a waiter ignore 10 people like this guy did
The food is below average, if you can tell the difference between the truffle fries and burger king fries I'll buy them for you
The bottom line is, this place is horrible if you are from the area and have a little bit of tase stay away
A client and I dined at Bette on Thursday eve and we both loved it
We had a 9pm reservation but arrived a bit early and were seated immediately
We started with Pear Bellinis and it was one of the best cocktails I have ever enjoyed
All courses were delicious - we had the artichoke dish a half portion of pasta with caviar to start and a sea scallop special (unbelievable!) and tuna for the main courses
Pumpkin dessert was out of this world and I don't usually care for pumpkin! The only thing we ordered that I would not order again was the caviar with creme fraiche and baked potato - go w/half portion pasta (above) instead
Very mixed and interesting crowd and beautiful room
Perfect place for a fun, sexy, and flavorful dining experience!
i don't understand the negative comments
I had a very good meal with excellent service (thank you david)
the crowd was beautiful and the food was good, not amazing but very simple and good
I think some people come with a chip on their shoulder because they can't get a prime time reservation but if you want glamour and fun , I say go!
I went there last week with 4 other friends, it was the worst service I've ever seen!! The waiter had no idea about presenting and serving wine, eventhough we paid more than $90 a bottle
He brought us the check without even asking if we need anything else, while we were getting ready to order desserts
When we opened the check, we realized that they added 20% tip, for that awful service!! We paid anyway, without saying anything
I put a note on the CC merchant copy for the manager to see and mentioned that the service sucked
The guy was ripping it off while we were leaving
I hope he/she will read it hear and take some action about it
Otherwise they will loose a lot of customers
My advice; don't go there! There are so many better places to spent money at!! It doesn't worth it!!!
Great spot! The food is simple but very well executed
Unlike the other reviewer I understood what the artichoke dish is about: softened ricotta (not goat cheese), tomato fondue (not artichoke), and crisp baby arichokes, complemented each other beautifully
The wine list is excellent, with truly great finds, especially if you are somewhat adventurous and into organic or natural wines
Just ask for Benoit (did I spell it right?) the amazing manager/sommelier who will explain it all with words everyone can actually understand
The crowd was well dressed, including the celebs like Sting, Halle Berry, and Naomi which were really there
The staff is very knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly, without attitude
Kuddos to the management on the training and hiring! In all, go there to see, be seen, but above all go there to have a very good meal with friends
I know I will return again and again
I dine out frequently and enjoy trying new restaurants
I had read favorable reviews in New York Magazine and The New York Times
I'm not a harsh critic, but Bette's was nothing spectacular
The decor was nice, but nothing extraordinary
The food was below average
Don't feel as if you're missing out on something by not having dinner at Bette's

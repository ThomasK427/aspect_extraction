Nevermind that it is also close to the train and that they now have a liquor license! Perfect
out of all the resturants that poped up in the area over the past few years this one is by far the most comfortable, and most importantly for me consistantly the best food
The menu is small, but everything tastes exactly as it should everytime
Probably the best hamburger i have ever had ( w goat cheese
) A calm relaxed atmosphere, never as crowded as the other spots around the hood
Damn, i sound like i am selling the place, but after being disapointed many times by other resturants in the area quality of food, and execution of recipies, i have never been disapointed here
Everything is always very good from a cup of coffee to a potato soup to the steak au povre! Cant go wrong! maybe wine list could be better though
Just what you'd expect in Ft
Greene, right down to the soft-spoken waiter with the deep 5 o'clock shadow
A half floor below sidewalk level, it's small, a bit cramped, but very cozy
You're really in the neighborhood here
You can watch the kitchen from your table
I go for the steak frites
My companions have had everything from salads to fish to chops and everyone loved it
Great date joint
I have been to Paneantico a couple of times and I'm definitely not impressed
Their sandwiches are way overpriced for what you get and their pastries are tasteless
The only good thing about this place is the gelato
You gotta love this place
My husband and I are regulars here on Saturday and Sunday
Breakfast or lunch, the food is delicious and my husband can't help but love their cannolis
From their house salad to their scrumptious desserts, the quality and authenticity is there
It is a great place for locals, as well as Staten Islanders, who miss their Brooklyn roots
We simply love this place - as do the other regulars (which by the way, you see every week as well
sometimes even at the same tables they sat the week before)
Bay Ridge without Paneantico
forgeddaboudit! Shout out to Stacy (our favorite) and the rest of the girls on the wait staff!!
This is a wonderful Italian bakery, coffee shop, and deli
The desserts are probably worth traveling for (pistachio cookies dipped in chocolate, mmm
) But their table service is indeed extremely bad - basically they hire a bunch of kids and don't train them or manage them
On a laid-back day the food is certainly worth it
Horrible service
Great food
I think I'm going to start taking the food and coffee to go b/c everytime I go there (which is quite often) I get more frustrated with the service
In Short Behind a storefront, with flower-filled window boxes, lies this modest bake shop
But proprietor Raven Dennis III, is known for creating elaborate personalized desserts for celebrity clients like Robert De Niro, P
Diddy, Oprah Winfrey, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and Patti LaBelle, who celebrated her 50th birthday with a purple high-heeled shoe cake
He'll cater for common folks, too, baking wedding and other special-occasion desserts
I've tried a number of times to get through to this place, and they don't answer the phone
I really want to order a cake and pick it up for a party, but I don't have enough time to personally stop by the store
I guess they really don't need the business!
I was at the Tribeca Film Festival today and bought some delicious cupcakes from an elementary school in Tribeca
The red velvet cupcakes was donated from the Cakeman himself and they were out of this world
The cupcake had a wonderful texture and just the right amount of sweetness
The cupcake was just the right size and was such a wonderful treat
I have walked into this place 1/2 a dozen times, and they never seem to have any slices available--of ANY kind of cake--which is very infuriating
The red velvet cake is divine, but the service is ridiculously unreliable
If you are going to see something at BAM or if you are shopping at Atlantic Center, take a walk over there, but if you are seriously craving a piece of red velvet find yourself a more reliable place
I've had a sample of this red velvet cake and wanted to buy my own
That's when the problems began
No one answers the phone all day nor do they have an answering machine that will take messages (the recording said the messages were full)
When they finally do answer the phone they refuse to let you order a cake without 2 days notice
Nor do they seem to want walk in business - when I asked if I could just come in and see if they had any cakes available I was told that they don't sell cakes at the store, only slices - cakes must be ordered 2 days in advance
How does a bakery not have cakes to sell? Not a very customer savy strategy
Glad I didn't waste my time going there without calling, but now I won't bother to try
The first time I went here they did not have any cake available
why they were still open
no one knows
so I came back since I heard how wonderful the cakes are
the second time, again nothing was left and they were open but this time one of the many guys behind the counter mentioned that a red velvet cake was ready
Okay, I'm not from the south but I'm sure I wouldn't want to be since this cake was not worth going across town to try, especially not at that price
and the red velvet part was more like red food coloring and lots of sugar
After hearing all of the hype about this cake, finally gave it a try
Have to tell you: Not at all impressed
First try was a bust; the store was closed because they HAD NO CAKE(huh?)
Later, it was open
A stressed mob crushed around the closed door, a worker in front to give updates as yet again, there was no cake ready, but one was coming
Finally let into the store 5 at a time, to buy expensive slices from a harried staff
Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa
the icing MADE this cake, it was fluffy, not ultra sweet, creamy and light
Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees
Average cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype
The best cake ever
Fresh and delicious
Good customer service by very friendly staff
wedding cake arrives from bay ridge bakery and says happy birthday CAKE MAN arrives
not only refrosts the cake but CREATES a masterpiece!!! all out of the grace of his heart
HIGHLY RECOMMEND the VELVET!!! we LOVE THE CAKE MAN!
You have to wonder why Citysearch hasn't reviewed the sweets here since they are out of this world! I am so addicted to this place! Their Red Velvet cake is awesome, but so is their Coconut Pineapple and even their Chocolate cake is exceptional! Their big cookies are outstanding! Simple chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and peanut butter
just one bite and you are guaranteed to eat the whole cookie! Another treat is their Apple Squares
everything I've picked up in this place has been outstanding! Now if the counter people could be a little more friendly, I might move in!
If your looking for a bakery that specializes in Southern cooking this is the place to go! They have the absolute best Red Velvet Cake there is
Its tastes just like its homemade
My mom is a southern belle and she even highly recommends his cakes
5
00 a slice but 2-3 people can share a slice
Worth every penny
Brunch and dinner are both great at this casual, authentic, friendly garage-door restaurant
The food is delicious and the people who work there are just cool people
(I just hope they get the AC pumpin' a little stronger soon!)
I keep returning to this spot for their brunch menu
I love the Latin Eggs Benedict and on the rare occasion that I deviate from that, I get the very tasty salmon omelette
They make a great Cafe con Leche, and their brunch cocktails are good too
The only downside to this spot is they seem horribly under-staffed
It can take a very long time to get your order and similarly, you''ll be waiting a while for the check too
Another reviewer pointed out the the wait staff is usually stoned, which seems to be the case most of the time
But! They are very friendly and the food definitely keeps me coming back for brunch
Don't go if you are in a hurry
Great brunch spot
The brunch cooks will always honor a vegetarian request (say to substitute ham for spinach in an egg dish) and the pancakes are killer

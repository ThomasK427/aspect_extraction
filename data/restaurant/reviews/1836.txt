been coming for years
absolutely everything you'd expect from a bistro
In town for business, I was walking SOHO when I came upon this tiny hidden gem
Without reservations on a Friday night at 8:30 I was promptly seated and given top-notch recommendations from both the host and my waiter
The calamari was surprisingly tender--no rubber band quality whatsoever
My Chikean Sea Bass was melt-away tender
The wine made the meal and my entire dinner (two drinks, appetizer, main dish, coffee) was under $50
One drawback, the tables outside are small and unstable, really the only dissappointment
We picked Bistro Les Amis after not getting last minute reservations at other Soho restaurants and what a pleasant surprise
The atmosphere is cute French country without being cheesy
And the food is delicious without being overpriced
I highly recommend the mussels with fries and the escargot ravioli appetizer is tops
The service was friendly and they let us linger and talk without completely abandonning us
I will definitely return
The sidewalk tables looked like a great date spot
I found this place by accident back in march 2002 and it was as fabolous then as it was Sunday July 7, 2002
The food was well prepared, the service was superb
The whole experience was definitely worth it
Would definitely go back
having grown up in chinatown, it's safe to say that i have been to about every restaurant enough times to never want to go back
but - east boat is simply one of the very few exceptions
the seafood is ALWAYS fresh, the portions always hearty
cant say the food is inexpensive, but you get EXACTLY what you pay for
fresh food, good portions
Walking into a restaurant run by Chinese can be irritating to someone who doesn't speak Chinese
However, you won't need to worry here
While much of the staff doesn't speak English well, they are quite nice and ready to please
The food is amazing, and the price is even better
6-course meal for two (lobster, crab, shrimp, scallops, and more) plus tax tip: $65
We were lured in with a moderately priced menu, casual dress code and decent atmosphere
Appetizers were priced on the menu between 4 and 6 dollars
We ordered the special and the price turned out to be $22
Beverage costs were not listed on the menu
A beer cost $7
50 and a glass of house jug wine cost $8
Most pasta's cost in the $10 range
My wife was delighted that half portions were offered
However one piece of cannolini cost $9
50
I ordered a lamb ragu pappardelle that seemed reasonable at $13
50 but the portion could have been larger
One beer, one wine, one appetizer, one salad, one full pasta and one half pasta, no desert or coffee cost $95 with tip and tax
We felt that we were cheated and would not return
Went there and had there arugula salad with shaved parmesan, parmesan is old and not a good variety
Then had cheese ravioli with marinara
The ravioli tasted like it came from a grocery store and I was charged the same price as if it was with porcini mushrooms - $15
00! It was terrible and a very small portion! I've had bigger and better at some of NYC's best restaurants! Would never, ever go back
I went there with my boyfried before heading to a party
We figured prices where reasonable
What a joke! I ordered the Cod special and they charged us $25
00 the serving was small and not that good, I was hungry after my meal
Drinks were also very expensive
We definetly won't go back!!!
Once again Monte's was wonderful
Friendly service, delicious meals, great location - can't be beat if you're looking for good italian in the village!
As a graduate -and often broken- student at NYU 33 years ago, eating at Monte's was a delightful gratification
After all these years and many trips back to NYC, the pleasure of enjoying excellent Italian food and Giovanni's royal treatment dispensed to each and everyone of his customers -regulars or not- still makes going to Monte's a gratifying experience not only for your taste buds but for your wallet as well
I wouldn't say it's culinary genius, but Greenwich Village has become the last standout of real Little Italy culture, and this is a perfect example
My girlfriend and I live in the hood and have eaten at several of the Italian places around, and this one stood out as being worth returning to
The owner, Giovani, is one of the main sellinng points
As soon as you step down and enter Monte's, you're greeted -- hugged and kissed by Giovanni, the long time owner, and given your choice of tables
I have been coming here for several years and know that the staff and bartender would be there with my favorite drinks and dishes I like to eat and drink on any given night
Dinner is never rushed and I could relax and chat as long as I liked
The meat sauce used for the spaghetti and meatballs is fantastic
I also love the stuffed veal chop and sauteed spinach and escarole with olive oil and garlic
Try the Tortellini Monte -- fresh made, fat with cheese and a beautiful alfredo sauce, mopped up with good crusty bread
Calories be damned!
Monte's is the perfect place to enjoy good Italian food and exceptional service at a reasonable cost in NYC
There's a reason it has been around forever- you genuinely feel like part of the family when you are there
I have been there countless times, and still return even though I no longer live in Manhattan
It's clear to me that the other reviewers must be friends of the owners
The place is like a time warp, they actually have Christmas Tree metallic garland used as decor upstairs
The food was average at best, you could get the same quality food delivered from any diner
My trips to New York are never complete without an incredible meal at this resturant in the Village
Always a warm greeting at the door by Giovanni with a kiss for the ladies
Highly recommended is the Veal Chop and Seafood Marinara
On the days he is closed just amble down the street to his brothers resturant
Same menu, quality and service
This is the real Italian dining experience in New York that you have been looking for
I have had food from Monte's both in the restaurant and home delivered, and either way the food was excellent
The setting is beautiful and romantic, the food is delicious, and priced not so bad
Service is excellent
Monte's is by far the best Italian in the Village, if not in all of Manhattan
The fresh pasta and the marinara sauce are incredible
Also try the eggplant parmigiana - it's like being in Grandma's kitchen all over again
An added bonus - Yankee fans can experience some great memorabilia and sightings - Derek, Torre, etc
are regulars
Fantastic little place
Very small, only six or seven tables, but cute atmosphere
And they have the best duck spring rolls in the city
Green Papaya is a great little place for a quiet dinner
The chips and peanut dipping sauce are a house speciality and the pad-thai is second to none
Good and spicy food
for less than $10 you get soup, salad and a steaming hot entree you'll def
enjoy
Somewhat slow service
Lunch specials on weekdays are of excellent value
I had the Friday special, which came w/ salmon fillet, salad, rice
This little Thai restaurant combines a romantic ambiance, with fantastic thai cuisine
The seasonal menu offers a delightful selection

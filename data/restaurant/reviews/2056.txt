The encouraging atmotsphere to be commited to wed, the pleasent service, the food it was the iceing on the cake
The song from South Pacific (Some enchanged evening) Summed up my dining experience there
Everyting about the place leads to a special a evening
The food, the service,the most romantic restuarant I have ever seen
I recommend it highly to all who want to experience what New York is all about
My wife and I recently were in NY and dined at One if by Land
The appetizer was incredible, the desert second to none (I am still dreaming about it) but my main course of lamb was not that great
The waiter was incredible and the atmosphere was everything people say it is-great
Definitely a place to pop the question - or rekindle the romance
You will see a lot of kissing there :)
Romantic, peaceful and wonderful food tucked into the village! Great when the fire is lit
incredibly romantic and great food
it's expensive but worth the price for a special occasion
From beautiful roses, twinkle candlelight to attentive hostess, it's everything one would expect on a romantic dinner, and more
If that doesn't melt her heart, I don't know what will :-) Frankly, the food is not on our mind, and probably not the most distinctive in NYC
Tips for first timer: Reserve your table a week ahead of time
$75 chef menu and $55 prix-fix per person is hardly expensive
Pay for parking if you drive, or else $110 ticket
One if by Land has absolutely wonderful ambience, especially during the cooler months when the fireplaces are blazing
My fiancee brought me here for my birthday the first year we dated and we have been back for several special occasions since
So romantic, and the food is very well executed
It's not the best food in the city, but the overall experience makes it worth a visit
Simply one of the best in food, ambience and service! Worth every penny
I love this place - a well-kept secret for many many years
I got engaged here and have celebrated almost every anniversary here
The staff is always polite and accommodating, the food has gotten better and better each time we come, and the ambience can't be beat in New York
Simple, old-world charm
I love the piano playing and the candles - the whole thing is just so special
For anyone who wants a special treat - go there! Or if you wnat great food in an extraordinary place - go!
A great evening
Thanks for making it so special! Our waiter John was great, the hostess Maria is a gem - everything was excellent!
Have been there twice for dinner this year
If you're looking for an impressive place with great food and atmosphere, this is it
A bit pricey, but I've spent more for less
average, nothing special
It doesnt live up to it's reputation
I felt like I walked into a fairytale when my husband took me here
It's so delightful
The food and service is unbeatable
This place was made for people in love
It's a perfect place to propose
Everything was wonderful here from the charming bartender and waiter to the spectacular food and ambience
There is no address on the door because of its historical promience so from the outside it's not what you expect
Expensive but well worth it!
The best place to bring her to show her she matters
Every effort is made to accomodate the couple in love
Wonderful ambience, fabulous food, superb service
who could ask for more? And at Christmas
spectacular!
smooth evening all the way through
wonderful food with a fabulous ambience
received no attitude and encountered gracious hosts and waitstaff
it is a new york must
I've been here on two seperate occasions, each being a meal to write home about
The food was perfect each time, and by perfect I mean flawless
The service was attentive but not overbearing, and the atmosphere is second to none
Truly the place for special occasions, or times when you just want to treat yourself right
It's a wonder inside this restaurant that is small but give the appearance of space because of the staircase, balcony level and dark colors
It's especially nice in winter with the fire place
It's not a cheap proposition but if you want to take the apple of your eye out for a real treat this is THE PLACE in NY
Service is excellent, food fantastic (go for the lamb with basmati rice and the banana tartine for dessert - sensational)
The setting is the icing on this rich cake
Melt in your mouth Beef Wellington with impeccable service
The ambience is perfect for any special occasion- especially if you're proposing! If she says no after bringing her here, you're in serious trouble
My husband and I were fortunate enough to win a sweepstakes and we were given $300 to dine anywhere in New York
This is the restaurant that I chose and it was the best dining experience of my life
wonderful food, beautiful atmosphere, friendly service
perfect place for a special date
This is a delightful surprise in the midst of downtown NYC
Its one of those places that you would pass a hundred times without knowing what it is inside
The food is sophisticated and delicious and what could be more romantic than fireplaces and candelight?
What an incredible place this is! As soon as you enter the door the magic begins
I loved the fireplaces,candlelights and the authentic colonial decor
The food is superb,very well presented and good to look at
My waiter was excellent and helped make this night an unforgetable one
I will surely come back again so i can try some other items on the menu
Everything looked so good!
Six of us had a business dinner there last week
Excellent food, great wine list, professional service
Beautiful space and great bar
Would definitely recommend it
We had dinner here last week
VERY romantic
The food was great
I would suggest the tasting menu
Service was very down-to-earth but professional
Dinner here is great but my favorite thing to do is go into the bar during the week (I'm a star-gazer - so shoot me)
We all know the really cool people don't do dinner on Saturday nights
I've seen Liza, Uma, Dolly, Yoko amp; Regis there on weeknights
From the minute we walked in, we were wowed
This place is hidden on a small street in the Village without a sign
We walked past it twice before we found it
Going through the doors, you feel like you have been transported to another place
There's a pianist in the bar, exposed brick and flowers everywhere and an amazing viewing garden
The food was amazing
(We had tasting menus
) The wine list was imposing but our waitress was very helpful and suggested a great bottle in our price range
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to impress
I just had dinner there with my girlfriend and we had the best time
Food was stellar, service was extraordinary and I've never seen such a beautiful restaurant

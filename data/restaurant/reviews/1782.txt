Our table was in the back corner and we felt forgotten the minute we sat down
The service was horrible
We waited much too long to order and receive drinks, never mind the food that came hours later and was mediocre
overall a very poor experience
would not recommend, except maybe to eat/drink in the bar area
The best pizza I have ever tasted
Vinnie is the master pizza maker
This restaurant will get discovered and fast
It blows Mario Batali's new restaurant away
Mario's pizza doesnt even compare to Vinnie's
Maybe he should call Vinnie for some tips because something is definitely very wrong at Otto
Congrats to Gonzo!
Mediocre and slow service
Waiter new nothing about wine list and didn't offer to find out - we just guessed and came up with something good based on price
And don't even try to check your coat
It took 20 minutes, standing by the door, for them finally to dig ours out of the piles of coats in their teeny tiny closet
So
don't check your coat and don't expect efficient service or wine knowledge but DO expect incredibly great food
I took my boyfriend to Gonzo on Valentine's day and the experience was perfect from the time we walked in until the time we left
One of the owners greeted us and guaranteed that we would be out in time for the theatre, the service was impeccable and the food was beyond all of my expectations - we will definitely be back! Oh yeah - leave room for dessert!
Chef Vincent's cusine never disappoints
From the fabulous grilled pizza to the dried-aged steak I have never been anything short of amazed
I especially liked the new side dishes and antipasti that were offered
After following him here from Scopa-which has become far too loud for my tastes-I found the ambience much more to my liking
The dining room was intimate without being too cramped
Make sure to leave room for desert
Don't expect to find lasagna or spaghetti meatballs here
They serve authetic regional italian fare
The braised short ribs were delicious and so were the wafer-thin, chrispy pizzas
The service and decor were above average
The only low point was the nickle dime approach to the menu
If you want vegetables or potatoes with your meats, you pay for them
Touted as an under $25 restaurant -- sure, the entrees were all under 25 bucks, but add a couple of side dishes ($6 for mashed potatos? I don't think so) and your dinner is suddenly 30+
Our entrees were too, too oily, though when we mentioned it to the chef, he did comp one of our sides
A nice selection of Italian wines, though, and a pretty room
Service only so-so -- I saw a lot of wait staff standing around, and at the busiest moment, I watched waiter stroll through the dining room with two plates as if he had all the time in the world
After a few visits, here's our reactions: the pizza is divine, the cicchetti (little appetizer dishes) are generally very good but can vary in quality, the main dishes are all solid, and the service has been faultless
You must make reservations for dinner
There are a few tables in the front bar section that you can walk in for, but after 7 pm you'll end up waiting for those too
Oh, and the brown sugar cheesecake is one of the best things you'll ever put in your mouth
Went to Gonzo for the first time on a weds night and couldn't have had a better experience
the food was fantastic (must try the fried stuffed olives) and the service friendly and helpful
My waiter recommended several inexpensive and delicious wine choices
It's a really nice space - much bigger than I would have expected - and the ceiling is beautiful (also the tables are very well spaced -- you never feel crowded)
the bill was the best surprise - $62 for 2 people (app, 2 entrees and bottle of wine!)
Can't wait to go back
Considering the area, Gonzo's should be about 50 blocks north - the staff seemed way uptight in suits and the decor at the bar in 'Bombay Company' fashion- the front room was also uncomfortably cold
Our waitress was pleasant, however - and the pizza was delicous - I dont' know if I'd try much else, as the Arugula salad was mediocre and bread way too salty
I'd only go back for a lunch-time pizza visit
The food is amazing and the atmosphere was enchanting - try for the back room - it reminds me of a wine cellar in Tuscany! And of course - the Pumpkin Pizza is not optional
All of the thin Pizzas we tried were exceptional, and some combined unexpected toppings (pumpkin, pancetta) in tasty ways
Too few restaurants offer dry-aged beef anymore, and their's was perfectly aged and cooked to our taste
The fresh fig crostata was refreshing and not too-sweet, and our friends thoroughly enjoyed their Caramel-praline ice cream sandwich
Service was friendly yet professional, and tables allowed space to sit without crowding one's neighbours
While it's true there was a lot of staff and the service could have been better, the service was extremely friendly
The hostess asked us if we had ever been there before and then explained the menu
The food was very good and the dining room was lovely
We had a great time
Although we waited about 20 minutes for a 8:45 reservation, that was fine because my girlfriend and I got 2 seats at the bar
Great selection of wine, especially with the Quartino(1/3 bottle option)
Pizza was delicious, as was my calamari
The deserts were absolutely unbelieveable, rich and lovely texture
Good prices on all courses ans the 20 yr
port is also a steal
Will be back soon
I Love Chef Scottos food! The comforting pastas and crispy, boldly flavored grilled pizzas are my favouites
Nice room too !
I don't understand all the hype
Four us went at 7:30 on a Saturday night
More staff than I've ever seen in any restaurant, and service was still bad (they were tripping over each other)
Food wasn't good either -- shortribs tough, lasagne had absolutely no taste
Nice-looking space, even though the table they put us at was right in the entranceway and we kept getting bumped by the waiters
I went last week for dinner and was very pleased
The staff -- though it was an extremely busy time (Friday night, 8:30pm) -- was attentive
In terms of food, it was delicious, though the menu is a bit misleading
Items are a la carte, so if you order lamb chops, that's all you get
No veggies, no nothing
Regardless, the much raved about pizza was tasty and thankfully wasn't the round, regular cookie-cutter fare
It was oddly shaped, translating into a rustic, homemade feel
The lamb chops were superb
The atmosphere was a great hideaway in the city -- high ceilings and everyone seemed like they were having a great time
Highly recommended
Everything about this place is excellent! The pizza is a nice twist on the doughy greasy stuff so many places serve these days
Love the atmosphere
I've been back again and again because it's relaxed and enjoyable
A great date place
I visited here last Saturday night
The food was delicious and the service was excellent
I really enjoyed the mushroom woodfire pizza
That was fabulous
I sampled both the chicken/eggplant lasagna which really was great and also had the veal pasta dish
Everything was great
The serivce really stood out and when one small detail needed to be corrected, they could not have been more helpful
I also really love the way the place looks!
The grilled pizzas are wonderful, but the service was lacking
Waiters looked harried and panicked, and it took forever for dishes to arrive
Plus the place is deafening!
Gonzos is a wonderful spot
The food is very tasty and the chef's signature pizza's are a delight
The 1 rating makes no sense this restaurant is brand new and they haven't fianalized the menu

I was really shocked at just how bad they were
The cupcakes were so dry, I could barely swallow them
Icing was OK, but nothing to write home about
Maybe it was a bad batch
? Place is cute, staff is nice, but if they ain't got the goods, why bother?
Call it an extreme obsession with cupcakes but I've sampled a lot of them -- from Sweet Melissa's in Brooklyn to the famous Magnolia Bakery to Cupcake Cafe to the incredibly sweet ones at Amy's Bread that no one knows about (but should)
But this is the #1 yellow cupcake
Service and food were great however I was very disappointed that Billy's was not more authentic in it's 50's atmosphere
The music playing was modern which REALLY detracted from it's 50's atmosphere and the servers were dressed in modern street clothes
It was my husband's birthday (born 1959) so I thought it would be fun to take him and his 2 kids to a 50's style place for birthday dessert
We walked about 40 minutes from where we'd had dinner with high hopes of a real 50's experience but alas, it was a let-down
I have to ask the owners, why go to all the trouble of creating such a place if you're only going to go half-way with it
Being from Kansas City, I couldn't tell you where the closest bakery was to my house
I did know where the Krispy Kreme was, but does that count? Anyways, I was out exploring the city when I noticed a massive line outside of Billy' Bakery on 9th Ave
Learning to be a New Yorker, I hopped in line, and waited 30 minutes
When finally ordered, all they had was cupcakes, I thought what yahoo waits 30 minutes for a cupcake, then I realized how delicious the cupcake was, how cool the atmosphere was
Only New York could make a bakery the cool place to be
I love Billy's Bakery, it definately needs to be in a book/brochure for places to visit!
Billy's cakes and cupcakes are a true delight
The only comparison to Magnolia is that it is a bakery - the staff and product are a thousand times better
It's a shame people focus on that and not the fact it is a true gem in an up and coming neighborhood
You can sense that just in the attitude (or lack of it) when you walk in
They're actually welcoming, as opposed to get you in and out
And the cupcakes are just as good, if not better by cutting down the sugar in the frosting just a notch
The German chocolate cake and the pineapple upsidedown cake are the best, though
And topnotch Illy coffee is served
Pizza hounds, take note: This chewy-crusted, tangy-sauced pie is definitely a contender
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene Some speculate that when Italian pizza chefs left Manhattan for the outer boroughs and 'burbs, they took the best slice spots with them
Thankfully, this Long Island pizzaman commutes into his cheery Greenwich Village pizza joint to repair that image
The brightly-lit takeout spot with a few non-descript tables and chairs looks like any other, but it tastes ten times more homespun
The Food The secret to the superb "Nonna Maria" pie rests in the owner's grandmother's thin-crusted Tuscan recipe
Hand-pulled, yeasty dough, baked on a bed of crusty breadcrumbs with just enough puff around the rim, is slathered with tangy, garlicky tomato sauce, puddles of milky mozzarella, fresh basil and a sprinkle of real Parmigiano
For gooey cheese people, there's the "grandma," made with regular mozzarella, but it's not nearly as distinctive
The behemoth ricotta-sausage calzone is excellent, just don't order it with mushrooms--they're canned
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places
They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny
Try it side by side and there's no comparison
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great! Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect
Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!  The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
Walked by with friends and heard someone on the way out say it was one of the best meals they ever had, so we went in
Patrick the chef, owner, and waiter is one of the best in the business
The experience is like going to a friends house for dinner (except the food is out of this world)
The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book
This restaurant is like no other, it is the way it should be
My friend selected this place for dinner and I think we discovered a hidden gem
First of all, the cook/owner (Patrick) made my favorite type of pasta that wasn't even on the menu
Secondly, the waiters were welcoming, kind, and made us feel completely at home
Everyone was so warm that we ended up staying after dinner to hang out with the staff and have a few drinks/laughs
I highly recommend this place if you're looking for the secret hidden in such a hectic city
Bocal is a treasure found! If you want amazing food with cozy ambiance, a staff that is there for you, music that is always a good surprise, and a place that you will want to tell everyone you know about and at the same time want to keep a secret this is the place
Finally a somewhere you can bring your own wine enjoy fine foods and have rememberable service
Its absolutely FABULOUS!
Had dinner here about a month ago after spotting it on Citysearch
We started with some drinks on the front porch and then continued at our table with a bottle of delicious red wine
The atmosphere was very nice, perfect for a romantic meal
Both our meals were quite tasty and the service was attentive but not overbearing
We'll be back to try the Sunday brunch
Get to this place before its over-run with hipsters
This local restaurant, is exactly what we all look for in a Manhattan bistro
Excellent service, really good and imaginative food (with a nicely changing but not pretentious menu), and great atmosphere
all helped along by an owner who cares enough about his restaurant and your comfort that he is there to make sure you enjoy yourselves
Its just a great, casual place that is good value and sure to be a hit in the neighborhood
I've been there for dinner as well as lunch
Wonderful steak sandwich, sirloin burger house club (salmon, scallop salmon w/ avocado greens; delicious!) among other dishes
Very friendly people nice ambience
Outdoor seating is good too as Sullivan street isn't too highly trafficked (too much car exhaust at nearby main thoroughfares such as Houston or 6th Ave)
Definitely worth a try!
I went with my wife to Bocal for brunch this past weekend and we had a great meal
The food was very good and the service was excellent
Also, we were given FREE cupcakes
a great surprise and VERY tasty indeed! We'll be back to try dinner
Excellent service and food
The wine list is one of the best and  one of the best values too! The food is exceptional as well
At teh end of brunch, the waitress brought out this TOTALLY DELICIOUS cupcake on the house! I would highly recommend this place!
My girlfriend and I stumbled upon Bocal while we were walking through the Village
From the outside it looked cozy inviting
From the inside, the staff was friendly and the drinks and food were both quite good
We'd recommend it
Look: A few years ago, I visited this restaurant and was very happy with the service and the food, so, this might have been an off night for them, but I simply had (last night) the worst bowl of pasta I EVER had in NYC,do you understand how bad EVER means?I simply HATE to complain, but I HAD to, the waiter, at first, seemed like wanted to pick a fight with me, but then, called the manager(a Brazilian lady, who could NOT put two sentences together in English) who (as best as she could) gave me the take it or leave it atitude
I left
Waiters try to hurry you if you go during normal lunch/dinner time
Waiters will run behind you if you do not pay enough tips (enough is decided by the waiters)
No matter if you go there just for a quick pizza or a full five course meal you get treated like royalty and walk away with great memories
The food is great and the pizza is the closest I have found in New York to the real Italian pizza
Not to mention my kids got to wear the chef hut and head for the kitchen where they made their own mini pizza
An unforgettful experience
My husband and I were interested in trying out the place since it recently opened right next to Jo Jo
So we made a reservation for a late dinner after our concert, and were pleasantly surprised by the friendly tone of the person who took our reservation
When we arrived there after the concert, we found all staff to be very friendly and polite, especially the matre d'
Perhaps it could be that they were trying hard because the restaurant is still new, but still, providing such a service and atmosphere at a late Saturday night was something to be credited for
Food and wine was also very well prepared, and the finall bill was fairly reasonable
I would recommend to other people who want to try a friendly casual (but nice enough) Italian restaurant in the neighborhood, and would come back myself, too

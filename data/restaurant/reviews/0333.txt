Always lit to be intimate, but not blindingly dark
Would like to be able to hold a party in their private room downstairs
I took a friend visiting from overseas with me to Jane on Sunday for brunch
We both loved it
The Eggs Benedict were delicious, but the Bloody Mary was so spicy hot I couldn't drink it
The environment is great- minimal, soothing, plenty of room around your table
The service was attentive and the prices were fair
Clinton Street Baking Co is still my favorite place for brunch, but Jane is great and seems like it would be a dependable place to go
I went to Jane for lunch with my parents and we had such a great dining experience
Everyone was pleased with what they ordered
I had a wonderful chicken salad with a lemon vinagrette and the most delicious homemade raspberry iced tea
My father had an egg white omelette with spinach and goat cheese and my mom had a salad with pears and gorgonzola
They both enjoyed their meals and they are hard to please
The menu also had so many good things that it was hard to decide what to get
Jane is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
The staff is very friendly, and the food is wonderful
Try the shrimp and tomato flatbread to start! The side dishes are also worth sampling
Overall very good
The appetizers were a bit overpriced, given the small portions, but the entrees and dessert more than made up for it
Of the 6 entrees we tried, only 1 (the risotto was a bit watery) was disappointing
Our only complaint was that the staff kept whisking away plates while the utensils were still in our hand
Guess they needed the table back! We had a large group and didn't have a hard time getting a reservation--I suspect that won't be the case for long though
everything about my sunday brunch was perfect
lobster biscuit benedict was savory and delicious
complimentary white peach bellini was unlike any bellini i've ever tasted - fresh fruity
absolutely lovely
i can't wait to go back and try the other brunch options (johnny benedict sounds awesome too) although it's going to be very hard to resist those lobster biscuits
We had a great meal overall at Jane
I would say, however, that the appetizers and side dishes were both better and more interesting than the main courses
The goat cheese and carmelized onion crisp appetizer was particularly good
I've been there several times and they never cease to please! The bread is yummy, as is the Johnny Benedict (my personal favorite)
Service is excellent
(One of my friends had a chicken sandwich that she deemed to raw
They offered to switch it right away and when she said it was ok, they credited our bill for the amount)
Very comfortable atmosphere
and the bar's not too bad either
:)
Really love this place, have a great weekend brunch with awesome french toast! Lunch menu is stellar, nice and big for picky eaters
Their french fries are to-die-for! Great martini selection, too, always served in a nice frosted glass
salmon tartare was a bit salty
Taihiti vanilla dessert was heavenly
A nice, trendy venue w/ solid food service
Absolutely amazing service
Had to plan a party for 10 picky women, and Jane came through on all counts
Wonderful reservationist
Great Prix Fixe menu, not to mentioned the customized heading
Made for a memorable dinner that everyone has raved about since
And even though our big party was 15 min late, they had no problem seating us
Thank you!!
Had dinner last Saturday at Jane
Food, service (waiter seemed very happy to do what he was doing - when did that ever happen?), ambience and moderate prices all contributed to an outstanding dining experience
I had the fried clams for an appetizer which was cleanly friend without any residue grease
And halibut for an entree which was tasty, it could've passed for the richer Chilean sea bass
My friend had scallops for an appetizer and a big chunk of salmon on top of risotto for an entree
Both were excellent, as well
Dessert was a huge peach cobbler enough for at least two people
Wasn't too fond of their watermelon martini
The downside, if you're trying to have a intimate conversation, is the noise level (like many New York restaurants)
Other than that, I will be coming back again and recommending Jane to friends
I went earlier this summer and had a delicious dinner, but nothing compared to the Warm Peach Crisp dessert that I finished up with! Compliments to the chef
Ive already been back once and I know I will return again
I took an out of town guest to Jane on a Friday night and was pleasantly suprised--we loved the salmon appetizer and the cocktails were delicious
The prices seemed reasonable with entrees ranging from $14-$25
I will definitely be back--
I have been to Jane a couple of times, and I will continue to go until I have tried everything on the menu! This is simply amazing food; not too showy but fun and every bite is delicious
The service is friendly, the watermelon martinis are refreshing, and I HIGHLY recommend desert (try the panna cotta!) Heads up if you plan to have a large group as they only except reservations at 7pm or 9pm for them, and have a prix fixe menu - but they are very accomadating and I would plan any large dinner party here if I could!
Went to Jane with a group of 10 friends for a birthday dinner last week
I was a bit concerned about having to select a pre-fix menu, but all of the choices we were offered were fantastic
The meal, from start to finish, was extraordinary, and the service was great
Our waiter was very attentive without being overly obtrusive
Wonderful atmosphere and a great place to languish over dinner
Don't miss out
I have been to many restaurants in New York City and most of the time, I leave disappointed
It didn't happen at Jane
The hanger steak is the best I've ever had, it was more tender than filet mignon at most other restaurant
If you want to have a guaranteed good meal without spending too much money, you must come to Jane
The food is absolutely fabulous
KIND OF TRENDY BUT NOT AT ALL STUCK UP
WHICH IS SO NICE
the food rocked and was so reasonably priced for this restaurant era
wine reasonable and DELICIOUS, too!!! 4 of us girls went for dinner before meeting a crew out and it set up a good mood for the whole nite
great staff and nice bathrooms, too!!!
I went to this place for my birthday a couple of weeks ago
The drinks were good
The food was really good and the atmosphere was perfect
Open and a little bit of a trendy scene, but not too much
I definitely recommend this place; and it's cheap too! (well, at least for NY)
I recently held a WONDERFUL birthday dinner here
They let me select a customized menu for my birthday party, and were more than helpful at all the arrangements
The food was wonderful, and the portion large
The service was great and friendly
It is hard to levy any complaint against Jane, however, for large groups, it is somewhat annoying that they dont have round tables, so you are stuck at long tables, making it difficult to all be fully engaged in coversation
Otherwise its top notch for quality and value!
Who needs a candle to remind you of your birthday? If it's so important, bring your own! My best friend and I needed no candles to celebrate, the food was wonderful, the staff rocks, the desserts are wonderful on their own
and the drinks are plentiful
Recently remodeled and expanded, Michael's is a suave, European diner
The menu is extensive, adding tasty mediterranean specialties and fresh seafood items to the standard diner menu, and the meals are very good across-the-board
Another good choice for a late night, Michael's is located on Broadway (a lot of the local nightspots are) and stays open 24 hours
The ambience is clean and pleasant, and the service is nice
The menu is classic diner food, and is good and plentiful

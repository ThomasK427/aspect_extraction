This is one of my favorite NY restaurants
The host is efficient and attentive
The bar is a pleasure to be at
The food is always great, and if you're there for brunch, be sure to try their bloody mary! I come here all the time and have not yet been dissappointed
i love love rue 57
so did my husband
we couldn't find anything like this in london where we came from
they have everything we love
sushi a big hamburger and good coctails
when we moved to new york, that was the first place we went back to
p
s
tao is awesome, too
My wife and I ate at Rue 57 tonight and had a good meal but it was pricey
I ordered meatloaf and my wife had sushi
The meatloaf was really good and a lot of it
My complaint was the service was not that good but the food made up for it
My wife and I had lunch here on January 20, 2003 and loved the food, service and atmosphere
The salads are great
I had braised short ribs with a potato salad made with horseradish that were great
The sushi bar seems out of place in a Brasserie, but so what? It kind of adds to the fun
We will definitely return
You are kidding right about being a good steak house
If so, they succeeded without even trying
Upon passing Rue 57, I was not sure what to think
A brasserie named after a French street that serves sushi
uh-huh i thought to myself
My next thought was god i could use a few drinks and a bathroom
So in we went, ponied up and ordered some shots and a couple of drinks
We sat and drank at a hearty pace
Drinks were well priced and the buyback rate was fantastic
After buying another couple a round, they bought us some maki
It was such a surprise to find some very good, fresh rolls
Great fish prepared with a deft hand! All in all a pleasant experience
And i don't recall what they had out on the bar for munchies, but i remember it being pretty good
Rue 57 is a conveniently-located bistro which would be a godsend for midtown locals, if only the food were better than merely average
In trying to be a jack of all trades (steak frites, Moroccan chicken salad and sushi all share menu space), Rue 57 emerges master of none
Meat dishes are either miserably underseasoned or wildly overseasoned
Sushi is decent enough, but underwhelming
Salads are oddly and awkwardly composed--Cobb salad, which should be chopped, looks more like an oversized antipasti platter
And the scene? Well, the couple from Iowa at the next table in the track suits and fanny packs might be satisfied with the faux-New York buzz, but you won't
My husband and I ate there Friday night and the food and service were absolutely wonderful
We ordered sushi for our appetizer and lamb chops and filet for entrees
Our waiter was David and he was wonderful
(cute too); all that poetic icky stuff (in the other review) was cute but unfair; the tables had white table cloths, so they couldn't have been sticky; all the servers wore a buttoned, collared shirt with tie, so if there was a hickey, you couldn't have seen it; the only complaint was that some of the tables were too close to each other, so you have to sit too close to your neighbors; otherwise, it was a great place
My company had a private event in the private room at Rue last week
The food was amazing! And the service was impeccable! We had a such a great experience that we went there for lunch this week and loved it again
For parties or just dinner for 2, this is the best place!
Try Rue 57 for amazing sushi and service
especially Stephen
He was the best part of our meal
In a recent visit to NY, we actually ate there twice as it was convenient to our hotel and shopping
The pommes frites are a nice addition to the brunch menu and I loved the long table of magazines and newspapers to accompany our morning meal
Don't forget to try their French martinis!
I had such a wonderful experience, our server (Stephen) was absolutely delightful
The food was delicious and the the restaurant had a very stylish decor
If you are looking for something that satisfies a steak menu and sushi menu close to fifth avenue after shopping
this is the place
I definately recommend
One of my favorite restaurants in NY
Excellent food-especially the sea bass, salmon, burgers, and chocolate cake
Attentive service, great managers and friendly staff
Highly recommended!
I usually love to dine out at good restaurants and on my girl friend's graduation I wanted to make the night out really special
I've read reviews on citysearch and came accross this restaurant
I finally picked it and made a great night out
I made reservations and ve were seated immidiately
The service was great
You drop a fork and watch ten people pick it up
The food wasn't just good it was terrific
Not to mention that whoever arranged it must have been a true artist
The desert was the best, make sure to try their hot chocolate cake
It's to die for
The only con is the price ($110 for two people for a full meal)
The menue is also rather small, though you can expect whatever they do have to be truly excelent
Went there for lunch becasue it looked nice
Food was mediocore, service was terrible even thouh there was no on =e in the restaurant
It's more for toursist than it is for someone who is expecting a good meal and good sevice
Left a 2 dollar tip because the service was so bad along with the wait time for our food
Really disappointed
This place has a nice atmosphere, and the steak I had was well-seasoned and nicely cooked
The serivce could be a little bit more timely, but overall, it was a pleasant experience
The steak is well prepared and the sushi is fresh
It was a good selection for my friend and myself as we both wanted different things that night
Atmosphere was a bit loud but other than that an enjoyable meal
The Scene The space, fit with imported giant urinals, zinc-topped bar, large antique mirrors, mosaic floor tiles and mahogany trim, looks like it's been around forever
And like all McNally hot spots, it crackles with energy, particularly from the groups who gather to share a bite in the bar
Despite the enduring scene, the restaurant plays host to a surprising number of families
Service is breezy, yet professional
The Food An ideal meal here starts with lusty, cheese-encrusted onion soup or a salad of frisee and bacon capped with a soft-poached egg
It moves on to one of the city's best salads nicoise, the dependable steak frites--served with thin, perfectly salted fries--or to hearty braised dishes like beef with glazed carrots
At lunch, fish-and-chips, croque monsieur and a garlicky roast chicken are satisfying and soundly conceived
this place is a cafe rather than a restaurant
well, there is a variety of food to choose from and you feel like you are seating in a french bistro and served french influenced food
it is generally a noisey place and I do not believe anyone goes there for a romantic dinner
I heard this place was pretty awesome from reading a review on Scoutsider (if you Google it you can find the site)
It was reviewed by a Japanese-French girl who wrote about some other places too
just cause celebrities come here, does NOT make it a good restaurant
it was just average lunching food
to be honest all the hype made it a disappointing experience

The food was quite bad
Altogether a very very bad experience
Would highly recommend people to avoid this place
What is wrong with these people
We went there last thursday to have a good night out with friends
Instead we almost lost our mind
Nobody who works there have any manners including the manager
I have been to Turkey and to the other Turkish restaurants in the city
Turkish people generally are very friendly and polite
Except all the people who work in this place
We had beyond very bad service, we were rushed,orders were messed up,and food was not good at all
It is a talent to run a bussiness that bad
Never go back
And they have to stop writing reviews for themselves
What a beautiful night I had there with my girlfriend last week
i wish i spend all my Thursday in there
I had the best meal and service
I would recommend this place to anyone
They are very polite, smart and fun
Manager made us feel so comfortable that we felt like we've been here hundreds of times
He was attentive to all our needs
it reminded me of several upscale restaurnats in ny
Worth every penny
Having never been to Turkey, the dining experience here has made me want to go visit the country
The food is delicious, fresh and there's grreat consistency
I've never been disappointed in the many times that I've been here
The service however, seems to be a problem
With a bit of staff training, specially on how to properly pour a bottle of wine, this restaurant will be much better than it currently is -- and it will be around for a long time
it was my first time at a turkish restaurant in NYC
I loved it
Everything was great
the food, the wine, desserts
especially the almond pudding
I highly recommend
thumbs uppp
way upppp!!!If you want a great romantic experience with a loved one, I recommend turkish kitchen
Held a birthday dinner for 20 people there on a Saturday night
They were great in planning the party and selecting a very reasonably priced menu
The food was great and the service even better
Highly recommend hosting your event there
I was born in Istanbul and I really really want to like this place
Unfortunately, every single time I have been there the service was just rude and gets worse with each visit
Especially the manager or host who kept walking by and giving us the evil eye to see the progress of our dinner so they could turn the table over to other customers
It made me uncomfortable and I barely tasted my food watching him walk back and forth
Turkish people are warm and friendly
This place is just full of themselves
The waiter was just throwing our dishes on the table without even clearing the appetizer plates and then they started clearing the food when we weren't even finished yet
While the food is decent, I think there are better places to have turkish food in the city without the attitude
my name is steve; i went to the turkish restaurant with my wife
it was our first time in turkish cuisine
we were hungry and we were try to find a place to eat
thats how we met with turkish kitchen and turkish cuisine
that was a saturday night and we just walked in
we waited like 15 minutes
then we got a table upstairs
small table but huge service
nice dishes but great captain
we enjoyed our night with him
i recommed calamari and lamp chopes both great
If you really wanna go to turkish restaurant you have to go that place and ofcourse upstairs for great service
thanks for lovely night turkish kitchen and mumur
If you really must, the food is fairly good, but if anything goes wrong with your meal, do not expect service with a smile
I came in with a large group, they got my entree wrong and brought out a new one only after everyone was finished
I barely ate two bites and then had them clear it
After asking to have the item removed from the check, the waiter failed to do so and the manager came over and told me he would have to REVIEW MOVIE CAMERAS to see if I had eaten any
They finally took it off, but really, the food is not so good that it is worth being treated like a criminal when THEY mess up your order
Being a Turkish native, I tend to have an inclination to visit this place from time to time
The food is delish, you just have to know the manners to consume, if you don't want to be frustrated with the service
That's how you're supposed to enjoy your dinner, particularly your mezes which you should be sharing with friends and always with a glass of raki (consume slowly) I don't even get to the entrees most of the time
The meat dishes will never taste as good as they do in Turkey
For appetizers, try the stuffed vine leaves, the eggplant salad, sigara boregi and mucver
For other Turkish food places in the city, try Ali Baba if you're into carbs: Lahmacun (Turkish meat pizza), peynirli pide (cheese pizza) and baklava
For those uptown, Pasha (west side) is unmistakably good (grilled feta cheese) and try Beyoglu (east side) Enjoy!
I love this place - there's this chicken in yogurt dish with pita bread that is absolutely amazing
this place is a little overpriced, but for that meal and the turkish martinis, it's totally worth it! and the decor is also very cool
very yummy food, very friendly staff, and reasonably priced food
steve forbes recently had nice words to say about this place and i couldnt agree more
i had lamb, with hummus, and zuccini pancakes
We had a great experience here--the waiters were so friendly, they even taught us some Turkish words! And the food was delicious, I truly ate to my heart's content
We will be back for sure! Can't wait!
I was looking forward to introducing my parents to Turkish cuisine
When we got to the brunch, first thing they asked was whether we can finish in 2 hours! Like we were going to be there alll day! We were seated in the furthest corner on the second floor as far away from the buffet as possible
For my parents, it's not easy climbing the stairs
When asked if we can have a closer table, they flatly refused although there were tables available
But it was good we were far away because the FOOD WAS HORRIBLE! Cold dishes were warm, warm dishes were cold, fruit inedible, my glass dusty, and the servers gave bite size servings
To top it all off, we were given our checks in the middle of our meal when we were there all of 30 minutes! Such hospitality! We paid our checks and left immediately
For anyone who enjoys good food, excellent beverages, superb service, and a refined atmosphere, turkish kitchen cannot be excelled
i love upstairs
turkish kithcen's managment clearly refuses to compromise any of the standards and methods which have made that establishment the premier eatery for almost 10 years
Bravo !

Other patrons were oohing and aahing over the sweet potato fries and the bouillabaisse
No condiments on table or offered, service average, smokey upon arrival as the kitchen is fully exposed and the space very tight
And $15 for 1/2 dozen oysters is offensive when far superior venues charge a few dollars less
Felt ripped off, had as a neighborhood resident especially - not a midwestern transplant looking to gourmet slum
Loved the food, the design was amazing
Great place to go for something special in the neighborhood
Corn pudding was heavenly and the fried tilapia was succulent to the last bite
went ti Tides for dinner on Sinday night, started out with the Mix Greens and Calamari, both were exceptional, dressing was light and flavorful and calamari was fried in a light batter not greasy at all
Then went on the Bouillabaise which was PERFECT!, a real seafood broth base and grilled seafood, my hubby had the Lobster Roll, hint of terragon flavor and soft but tasty sweet potato fries
For dessert we had the Apple Crisp which was perfect and a Earl Grey Choc
cake that was good
All in all it was an amazing meal that I didn't think could be found in the LES but you really should go check it out
The service was perfect
I guess all I can say to describe the place is
Perfect
This little restaurant is packed with great flavors, staff and beautiful decor
We started off with the steamer and it was our favorite steamer of all time
We also tried their lobster roll and soft shelled crabs
Delicious! The only disappointing things were the limited wine list and the dessert
Our dessert was a bit hard and not enough of flavor
I think we had the brownie and keylime pie
Overall I totally recommend this place
I was visiting NYC and a friend brought me to this restaurant
The staff is really friendly
They helped us pick a wine suitable to our palets
My friend had the lobster roll, which was tasty, but not heavy at all
I had the scallops
seared to perfection! And the espresso brownie for dessert was heavenly
The decor and bathroom is real cute too! I'm definitely coming back again the next time I'm in NYC
so I went to Tides last night for dinner and it was absolutely great! We had the Steamers and Oysters to start, both were tasty and fresh
For our entrees we had the Lobster Roll and Grilled Whole Fish, the roll was amazing with the dill and cucumber, one of the owners Steven, said they are about to move into next season's menu where it will become a Terragon base roll (yummy!)
The whole fish was grilled perfectly and the meat was as tender as it should be
We had the corn pudding (OMG, it was FANTASTIC) and the grilled veggies as sides
Wine list was small and perfect
Me and five friends went to Tides last night
I live on the block and have read some stuff about the restaurant and any lobster spot on the LES deserves a try
Steve, the owner is really great
Our waiter was also amazing and the service was totally on point
They were very generous and brought out some things for us to taste
The calamari was gread and everybody was totally pleased with their entree
I had the cod and it was great
Go with the key lime pie for your desert
The red wine they recommended was phenominal (along with the white)
The ambiance is really nice too and all around its just very nice dining experience
Great for neighborhood people and service industry peop's
i'll def be back soon - along with all my friends
after reading the other reviews
i decided to give this place a try; and boy i'm glad i did
What a wonderfull place
Everything was excellcent from the service by our waiter to the owner Steve to the food
I went with my girlfriend and had the fried calamari which was very good but the best were the entrees
she had the pan seared salmon which was cooked perfect
I had the red-snapper whole fish which was prepared excellent
I hope this place last because i can't wait to go back
thanks again Steve for a wonderfull expericence
Can you say I want seconds, thirds and fourths! This little restaurant on the LES (Lower East Side) is a gem
The food is awesome! The oyster was to die for, the lobster roll was outstanding and service is fantastic
I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu
If you want a romantic seafood dinner this is the place for it
Also checkout the bathroom
My girlfriends and I dined at Tides two nights ago and absolutely enjoyed the steamers, which were succulent and bigger than what we had in other restaurants
The soft shell crab was delicious, as was the jicama 'slaw on the side
Service was excellent, the price was affordable and we definitely will be returning to Tides again soon!
We had the lobster roll and it was so refreshing, not bogged down with mayos, taste of dill and cumcumber, it also came with sweet potato fries
My friend had the scallops and we kept stealing them from her, it was so tasty, accompanied by Swiss Chard and corn pudding (the best)
The corn pudding remind me of having ice cream for the first time when I was a kid, just close your eyes and enjoy it
Softshell crab melt in our mouths
Very friendly staff and owner
Will go back again and again
We ordered steamers for appetizer which melted in our mouths
For our main course, we had the cod fish, softshell crab, which was really good but their fried whole fish was was to die for
Their brownie and lemon cake for desert hit the spot after that awesome meal
Can't wait to go back
Good food!!! Loved the decor
The space is small but well thought out and comfortable
Must have the fried oysters clams appetizer, so fresh the oyster just melted in my mouth
The menu was simple but covers all the bases
Friends and I had the cod filets and soft shell crabs! Both were excellent
We finished off the meal with an awesome expresso brownie
So good, we took one to go!
We went to LUZ for my Bday
As usual, we sat at the bar and after a year without going there we realized that the change a little bit the menu
we tried a couple of the new ceviches, and they were just glorious!! Then we had the lamb and the sea bass, and they were amazing!!! The dessert was even better, and the drinks
The Margaritas and frozen mojitos are the best
It was an amazing experience!
After reading the great reviews of this restaurant, we were excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood
However, we were very disappointed with our first visit for Sunday brunch
The food we ordered was ordinary - even bland
You'd be better off at a diner
We will give it another chance for dinner which hopefully will live up to our expectations
Until then, we will not return for brunch
The decor/ambience is great and cute
The Sangria was tasty and the food was delicious
The appetizer (lightly fried oyster layered with mashed platain and spinach) was exceptional and the dinner (roast pork, shredded, with rice and maduros) was flavorful (thank god I have left overs)
The prices are extremely reasonable and my waitress was very attentive
I would definitely recommend Luz to everyone!
Visited Luz three times and the service is wonderful
The barman is well educated about the drinks, knowledge of the food and history of the restaurant
The food is awesome
I love the cultural mix of the dishes served here and can say that each dish was tasty and well presented

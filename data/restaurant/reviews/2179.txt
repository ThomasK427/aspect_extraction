My favorite have a client to dinner place in NYC
Old boy atmosohere, prompt service, great steaks and sides
Expect to find good wine, but no bargains
Highly recommended
I've had much better steaks for a lot less money! I like mine med-well
This one managed to be med-rare, but still charred and crispy on the outside
Sparks is a good time with great food
The steaks are well flavored, and the wine is excellent
The menu is a little sparse, even for a steakhouse
no porterhouse, no prime rib, not even a ribeye
But the filet and sirloin were both superb
We were seated promptly and treated with nothing but respect
The waiter was not informed about the wine list, and offered no one who was, but we still got a great selection
Overall a very nice time
Big butter coated charred to perfection steaks and unbelievable creamed spinach - the wine list weighs about three pounds
Can be dark and smoky
Certainly not one of New York's best
A better steak can be found at any 2 star restaurant
Old school and old relationships do not necessarily mean great food
The establishment adds to their quality with an extensive wine list and knowledgeable staff
A little class goes a long way
Sparks is a fine place to wine and dine
excellent Porter House and filet mignon
Excellent service
Price a little high
If you be a great addtion if they served some good beers on tap
Overall, excellent
No one gets a 10!
I was expecting so much more on my first trip to Sparks
What I got was a good steak and good sides (no better on either count than any number of good steakhouses in NYC however) and some of the lousiest service I've ever had
The waiter knew nothing about the wine list so we asked for a sommalier
He replied, all the sommaliers are busy
Ooooookaaayyyyy
We then waited an hour and a half for our appetizers and another half hour for our steaks
I'll take Luger's anyday
Mike Pat Setta started as butchers and really know meat
Steaks here are as good as they get and the wine list is the most extensive I've ever seen
Always a first choice for the Wall Street crowd and many film personalities
Seafood is also an excellent choice; large Maine lobster a speciality
The restaurant has a warm tavern like decor; lots of wood and good table spacing
Top-notch service to go with a fine meal
Just make sure your AmEx card has plenty of room
Sparks is my favorite restaurant/ steakhouse in NYC
I get great food, excellent service and more personal attention than fom any other dining establishment in NYC!
ONE OF THE BEST STEAKHOUSES IN NY
COMPETES ON THE LEVEL OF THE PALM; BEN BESONS; THE MANHATTAN GRILL; SMITH AND WOLLENSKY AND MORTONS
IT MAY NOT BE PETER LUGERS--BUT IT HAS A FANTASTIC WINE LIST AND A LARGE MENU
THE SERVICE WAS PROMPT-THE QUALITY OF THE STEAKS THE BEST
THIS PLACE IS A MUST IF YOU REALLY ENJOY STEAK
very presumptuous, overpriced, and quite frankly, I've had better steaks in restauarants at a fraction of their price
excellent dining experience, from the time we entered the place to the time we left they made us feel a-one
I WENT TO SPARKS FOR MY 40TH BIRTHDAY
MY FATHER ASKED FOR A MARTINI MADE A CERTAIN WAY THE WAITER HAD NO CLUE WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
MY WIFE ORDERED A STEAK MED RARE IT WAS COLD IN THE MIDDLE
WHEN MY BEER WAS FINISHED I HAD TO FLAG DOWN THE WAITER TO GET ANOTHER BEER
FOR THE MONEY SPENT I WOULD GO TO ANGELO MAXIES ANY DAY
I take great pride in knowing good steak
I cook a great steak
I eat only a great steak
I've been to many steakhouses and I think I know the differences between nearly all of them
Sparks is the standard bearer in my mind
Despite service that can be hit or miss, the steaks are superb, cooked exactly to your standards, and just BUTTAH! While I respect other reviewers, I really cannot understand why some people can question the steaks
I can only chalk it up to bad luck
Ask anyone whose been here several times and they'll all tell you the same thing--just the best
We had a 7:30 reservation for 6 on a Thursday night
Was told we would have to wait 45 mins
bottom line, we waited til 9 and never got seated
Not to mention that the maitre'd was rude and obnoxious
I wouldnt go back even if they were handing out $50 bills
Save your time and money, go to the Palm or Peter Luger's instead
Sparks was an experience all in its self
I was there a few years back on a business venture after a Yankee game
There were 5 of us
we went nuts! Bring the company card, because it is expensive, but well worth it!
We went to Sparks for my sister's 30th birthday
Walked in, the bar area/atmosphere was great; bartender made a mean martini
Then it went downhill from there
We had a reservation but had to wait for about 20 minutes
The food was horrible
We were speechless at how bad everything was, the salads, bread, steaks
It was truly the worse good steak house we've ever been to
went with a group from work in a room downstairs i believe
filet minions were quite honestly a joke
meat was not tender and very chewy
since this restaurant has a good rating, all i can think is they have two cuts of meat there
one for people dining at regular tables and an inferior cut for people coming in a larger group in a private room
i cannot stress enough how disappointing this meal was
Yes it is pricey but the steaks are great and the ambience is what you want at a steak house
Don't go if you want seafood
This is a real steak house
Very large portions of great food
Good selection of steaks
Great staff! pricy
Great N

location
With all the talk I heard about this place, I thought I was in for a real treat
Man was I wrong!! The steak was so so, I think they were serving Paul Castellano
The appetizers sides were ordinary

The food, while small in portions, is simple, yet flavorful
Overall, a good place for dinner with a friend without breaking the bank
Good date potential too!!
Very disappointing, the tuna was okay
The mayo sauce was very runny
The beef was alright
Had much better in other places and for US$34 bucks it better be alright
Chocolate pudding tasted like jello version
Only with some fancy violet touches
Not worth it
The staff at Perry Street is beyond rude on the phone
When we finally got a reservation, we assumed it would be packed since they are so unaccomodating
The restaurant was empty
And after a disappointing meal, there is a good chance it will stay that way
The location is ridiculous- who wants to eat on the West Side Highway? And the decor feels like an eighties hotel lobby
The food was unexplainably salty
The dumplings that everyone raves about were mushy and salty
I had to take them out of the broth to minimize the salt sinking in further
Nothing seemed right; none of the entrees we tried tasted good
Even the dessert was a let down
If Perry Street is going to keep up the allure of exclusive, I guess they better continue being rude on the phone
Sorry but I do not know who all these food critics are who are lovin' this food
They must have eaten at a different place than the one they described
Their famed rice cracker crusted tuna was greasy and you could taste the oilness
It didn't help that it came with a mayo sauce either
I had the fish
The presentation was the fish was placed on the right side of plate and little bity tomatoes on the left
The waiter poured what looked like Campbell's tomato soup on top of it
My dish looked totally nasty, gross and unappetizing
My friend had the beef which had the same weak presentation
The only good thing about eating there is the place is beautiful and serene
This space has so much potential
The food is wonderful and the location and space is wonderful
But the interior is so sparse and white with no aesthetic direction, and the lighting after dark is so poor and subdued (not romantically candlelit) that my friend looked about 20 years older under the lights -- not the ideal lighting design
That being said, everything we ordered was melt in your mouth delicious - from sushi appetizer, to the fish, to the amazing chocolate dessert, Jean George did not dissapoint
It is very unfortunate that the the interior ambiance is not as complimentary and inviting as the menu
I was underwhelmed by the food at Perry St
Where's the flavor? I had the cod with fennel puree and at best it was mediocre
Also tried my friend's rabbit
It was only slightly better
Also, the service was overly present
The waiter was conspicuously eyeing our table the entire meal and there was a lot of scurrying by the wait staff in general
Kind of annoying when you are trying to have a relaxing dinner
We will NOT be going back
Minimal in style, complex in taste says it well
Genuine quality threads through everything from the service to the ingredients to the wares
(Example A: The hostess really seems authentically friendly
Example B: The water glasses are Riedel
) The view of the West End over the Hudson and the minimalist decor really allow the most simple pleasures to burst through
For a leisurely 3 hour lunch, I am unsure how to describe the loveliness of
bread
salt
tomatoes
mozzarella
chamomile citron tea
and a nibble of a good girlfriend's candied violets on the dessert
Sometimes less really is more
JJ's is a quality sushi place in Astoria Queens where you can get inventive and delicious rolls as well as a nice assortment of sushi pieces that are tasty in you mouth
The place is a little tight and can get busy on weekends, but they do take reservations if you have a large group
I've only ever had excellent service here, friendly and prompt, well worth the 18% gratuity that most people consider the standard tip in our troubled economy
But I guess since fellow user reviewer emeril13 is after all famous tv chef Emeril he shouldn't need to tip that much, just a friendly BAM! and all should be pleased
It started out to seem like an ok night but the service was lacking and it's not like the place is huge
Then the food was ok no out of this world food
Check time comes and the waitress takes it and comes back and says was there a problem gratuity is 18% well I felt I had left a generous tip which I usually do but apparently it wasn't enough
So I won't be going back
SO if you do go remember on $100 check they expect $18 or more as a tip
This place offers excellent Asian fusion food
I love blackened Tuna dish with potato spring roll and edamame pot sticker
They are both very well orchestrated
There arent many good Asian restaurants in Astoria area, so we are happy to have them
Very friendly service good price, too
Not sure why they keep claiming French, but I guess the menu is somewhat fusion
Anyways, we love thier food
(sushi rice can be harder
)
I was in ABSOLUTE heaven when I ate here with my husband
Food was top notch -- fresh, creative, modern, and wonderful, friendly service
I went based on the two reviews here on citysearch and now there are three
What we ate: the edamame pot stickers, crispy duck salad, seared tuna, Phonenix roll, and special of the day which I will be dreaming about forever -- Lobster Roll
JJ Restaurant is one of those hidden gems that you have been looking for
I am so happy it is here in Astoria!! No more trips to the East Village for Sushi
This is some of the wackiest yummy sushi I've ever had!  I recommend only getting the Chef's special rolls
there's no point in bothering with the traditional sushi rolls, they are pathetic compared to the delicious wonderful specials
I really enjoyed the Tropical Roll 2
Service was excellent- couldn't believe that one woman was handling the entire restaurant
she was amazingly efficient!  Prices are totally reasonable too, for this quality of sushi
It was $60 for a meal for two, with several drinks and dessert
Nice!

's is such a wonderful resteraunt, my gf and I eat here once a week religiously
They serve wonderful salads and noodle dishes, but the sushi is the best in Astoria -Hands-down!!! The service is super-friendly, attentive, and knowledgable
Try one of their special rolls (bluefin toro), or the edamame pot stickers as an appetizer
The resteraunt itself if small, but always bustling with the perfect ambiance
They have an extensive sake menu as well as a variety of beers
Did i mention that the prices are very reasonable - Come try this place!
Before I can even write my review, I have to ask how this possibly got stuck in the French Food category?????  For a Japanese/generic Asian fusion place, JJ's is quite good
The first time I ordered JJ's, through delivery, my dish was drowned in goopy sickly sweet muck to the point that I refused to try it again for months
However, when I finally was persuaded into stopping by for a meal there, my experience was 100% different
There were few vegetarian options, but the fried rice was some of the best I've ever had

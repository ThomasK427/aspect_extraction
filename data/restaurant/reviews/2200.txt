I've been to most of the steakhouses in NYC and this was far below them
The waiter was unattentive and grouchy, each of the three steaks in our order were tough and not tasty
Furthermore, the two sirloins ordered medium were served very rare
The side dishes were bland as were the desserts
Be wise and spend your money at one of the other steakhouses
Looked like a nice restaurant and based on the prices expected good service and good food
Sadly though have to say after a week of eating out in NY this place was by far the worst service we received and by far the most expensive place we ate at ($260 for 3 of us)
The waiter delivered our food and then walked away never once asking us how our food was or if we needed anything else
Then had the water boy in his food stained apron take our dessert order who also was the person who delivered our dessert
The only redeeming factor of the night was the dessert which was very good but certainly not worth the cost of an overall horible experience
When I compained to the Manager on the way out he had nothing to say, he just walked away
as a former meat cutter and semi gourmet cook, every visit to Gallaghers has been exceptional
We have eaten at Gllaghers 7 times and the tenderloin and service have been impeccable everytime
Old time ambience and worth every penny
If you are looking for a bargain, go elsewhere
If you are looking for great steaks and service, I highly recommend Gallaghers
Enjoy!
For all I've heard about Gallagher's, I expected more for my $$$$
The service was fine, our waiter was prompt and courteous
But in my opinion the food isn't worth the expense
I've had better crabcake and steak elsewhere, for a third of the price! My steak (ribeye), was flavorless
So was the creamed spinach
I've been dining at Gallagher's since the 1970's and have always found the entire experience to be enjoyable
Most recently, my family and I had lunch there on September 24th
My wife's Cobb Salad was large and delicious
My chopped sirloin was prefectly cooked and juicy
The $20
05 Power Lunch special is a real bargain for 3 courses
The ambiance is old New York
I especially love the dry aged steaks, an expensive process rarely found in steakhouses
We'll keep coming back!
There are steakhouses and then there are STEAKHOUSES
My parents first brought me to Gallaghers back in the early 60's and every time I am in New York, I stop in at least once
From its walls lined with autographed pictures of notable celebrities and the aged wood floor which once was covered with sawdust, to the checkered tablecloths and oak furnishings, Gallaghers first surrounds you with its history
Then the food and quality service take over to complete the fantasy
The appetizers are large and tasty and the steaks are out of this world
If you want to share in the history of Broadways first steakhouse while you have a wonderful meal with some of the cities notables, you must visit Gallaghers
The food is unbelievable, but the waiters are nowhere to be found
Despite being the only people in the restaurant on an early sunday afternoon, the service felt as if there was a 2-hour wait on a friday night
Still better than bensons or chris's
frankie and johnies still number 1
For those people that have poor reviews about Gallaghers-you should continue to go to mcdonalds or something- there is NOTHING bad about gallaghers at all teh food is delightful the service perfect and the wine list is just fine- it is a great restaurant with even better food
If you haven't been to Gallaghers-YOU MUST! The food is amazing-from the soup to appetizers and salads ( I must reccommend the caesar salad!) to the delicious steaks you wil enjoy every moment! And may I say if you leave without trying the chocolate mousse cake-you will be missing out! Whether you are a group of 2 or 20 Gallaghers wil accommodate you! Enjoy!
I went to Gallagher's last night with my friends from overseas and they really loved it
Tasty steaks and wonderful good old days decor
the service was not so great, though
it took us forever to get the server's attention
We ordered 4 dishes of different cuts of beef and shared with 6 people, in addition to a couple of potatos, salads and desserts
came up to be $55 per person including the tip
Not so bad considering that we were in the middle of the times square
In conclusion; excellent choice for forign visitors who don't have time to travel to Downton or Brooklyn and wants to have good Amrican food
But if you live in New York, I don't find much reason to go there
Wow It is the best steak I have ever eaten
I have eaten at a lot of steakhouses and find most of them average at best but Gallaghers is the best by far
The service and food were above all expectations and I expected a lot
I would highly recommend
The service was beyond belief
the quality superb
the best tasting filet mignon that I have ever had!!!
I found the real New York steak house, Gallagher's Steak House
This restaurant signifies the classic old New York with excellent prime steaks
Being a steak lover and knowing the difference between good beef and great beef, this is great beef
The staff is another New York classic experience, straight forward service with a true and positive New York attitude which makes it the real deal
No other place to eat and experience great steaks
I consider myself well-versed in steakhouses - this place truely legendary
Walk in and your stepping into good ol' New York
The steaks are as good as they get, and what sets these guys apart from the majority of steakhouses is that they take the rest of the menu just as seriously
Do try the baby spinach salad, dry-aged sirloin, hash brown potatoes and their killer rice pudding
Went to Gallaghers for the first time on a Saturday night, had no problem getting reservations, great staff-great service
Food was amazing, blows Ruth's Chris away!
I've dined at Gallagher's on a few occasions and have always been pleased
The steaks are wonderful and the service is good
Very convenient if going to a show nearby
Not one person working there, from the minute we walked in, was friendly, smiled or cared to have our business
We were 4 adults with 4 kids (aged 10), when we approached the coatcheck she told us she wasn't taking the kids' coats -- that we should hang them behind the chair! Our waiter was inattentive
Gave an attitued when we requested their much hyped pre-fixe menu, had to ask many times for water, extra soda
would never go back -- ever
Too many other places that I would give my $$$$ to
The meat was cooked wrong for half the group and the waiter was well done
Tougher than a bow legged steer
My steak was cooked ok but my attitude sucked after our group dealt with Mr
Personality
I had dinner with a few of my friends, and it was the best we've had in a long time
The porterhouse and filet were tender
Just being able to see the dry aging process in front of you is wonderful
The atmosphere and service was great
The waiters made you feel at home
But the most important thing is you get a huge steak for a great price, especially in Manhattan
You will be hard pressed to find a better steak in such a touristy area
But on the whole, the food is only few degrees above pretty good
nothing exceptional
The steaks we had (porterhouse sirloin) were generously thick and delicious
Not inexpensive, but the staff treats you like royalty and the experience was topnotch

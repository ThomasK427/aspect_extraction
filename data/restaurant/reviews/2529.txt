They love food here
They know how to cook it
Don't go here if you don't know food
Go as often as possible if you want excellent service, quiet, and fabulous delights on your plate
It's tiny
And wonderful
The flashy part is the cooking not the surroundings
You can eat at the bar across the street, too
And get the incredible guacamole there
A cramped room is where you can find excellent fare
I had a scallop ceviche, and a codfish dish which was great
Beside the small room, the decor was nice and the food was definately worth the trip
At first I stumbled into the restaurant when I was actually seeking the wine bar, but the host very kindly set me straight, so I crossed 81st St
and settled in for a lovely solo meal at the Bar at Etats Unis
Small and stylish, with persimmon-sponged walls and hanging paper lanterns, the convivial little room was filled with a lively crowd
I enjoyed perfect duck confit with a crisp, bright mango salad and a glass of steely Saint Veran, followed by the truly awesome date pudding
The limited menu is prepared onsite sans kitchen, but patrons can also order from the restaurant across the street
I liked everything so much I returned twice more in the next week
If only it was a tad cheaper I would go there every week!
The food is so good, so fresh and flavorful
I've eaten there many times and have never been dissappointed
Food is creative and perfectly cooked
Try the souffle, it is not too soupy as the review mentions
Enjoy the experience, it is a favorite hang out for chefs
Just like the best presents come in the smallest boxes (especially blue boxes with white ribbions!), Etats is an amazing restaurant in a very small space
The atmosphere is nuetral almost with tones that invoke images of a calm beach painting - definately a destresser
You can also talk to your dinning companion without yelling! The food is always awesome! I'm a really picky eater and I've never been unhappy with my dinner
We rate this as our first choice to celebrate lifes little victories!
One of my favorites, though I usually go to the bar (across the street) rather then the restaurant
The chocolate souffle is terrafic, but try the date pudding desert and you will see it is the best date in town
I was really fired up to go here after reading all the great reviews on citysearch, but I have to say, I was disappointed
There's no music playing in this TEENY space (we counted 12 tables in all) just the voices around you, and the decor is all but missing
Service is very friendly and there is a good wine selection, but my salmon was undercooked and not very flavorful
My boyfriend's crab served with corn on the cob was good, but nothing to come back for
And at $30 a plate, I expect much more
I find Joanna's on the Upper East Side a much better secret than this place
I've been going to Etats-Unis for 4 years now and never have had other than a great meal
Despite the menu's small size, it has variety and is perfectly balanced for diverse tastes
The date pudding was sublime as always, and the wine list offers some pretty well priced selections
Etats-Unis is not a flashy restaurant or a people-watching scene
It is cozy peaceful place with the best food on the U
E
S
This is the second time I've been to Bar Etats Unis in about a year (across the street from the restaurant)
Both times, I have been delighted with the wine selection, quality and deliciousness of their bar menu items
Cozy but sleek interior is so much more grown-up than BEU's East Village counterparts (I live downtown, so I am even a bit biased towards my own area)
This place one of only a handful reasons I would consider moving to the Upper East Side
Keep up the good work!
The Scene  The Scene Jasmine is simply appointed in dark wood
In the afternoons and early evenings, it is a bright, cheery restaurant, full of families with kids; then, when evening falls, the lights are lowered and the music raised (slightly), as the room fills with young Upper East Side couples
The Food The restaurant serves an array of standard Thai fare
Jasmine's version of pad thai, rice noodles fried with shrimp, egg, and tofu, achieves a nice balance of sweet and savory, with a good chewy texture
Coconut-milk curries, like a tart green one with vegetables, and a richer, ruddy Panang-style one with chicken or beef, are fine examples of the genre
An appetizer of vegetable summer rolls is on the dry side; much better is the yam nuer yarng, an excellent salad of grilled steak slices, onions, and greens, liberally dressed with lime juice
Coconut rice pudding makes a fine, subtle dessert
Just moved recently into town and used City Search to find this place
It had great reviews so maybe I had high hopes
However, our experience was very opposite to the postings
The food was so-so but what made it awful was the service
The staff was unattentive and extremely rude
Needless to say, I will NEVER go there again
Reliable food, nice atmosphere, great value
I've been here dozens of times and have almost never been disappointed
I wouldn't order the spring rolls, but everything else is very good, and the value can't be beat
Excellent for delivery or take out as well
I love this place! The food actually tastes like Thai food and not altered toward American tastes (i
e
bland)
This place is romantic for couples or fun with friends
I highly recommend this place
Though the overall review says this place isn't romantic, my man and I find this place so cozy
The food is always delicious
The price is always right and the service has always been pleasant
We've declared it our favorite Thai restaurant
beside i have to wait long time with my food, waiter service ok but unfriendly
that was really a bad time for me and my girl friend
if u try to find romantic place try other place
For a Thai first-timer, this was definitely a good start
Restaurant was casual and comfortable, but had enough ambience to make it a great date spot
Though the service was a bit lacking, the food packed enough punch to make up for it
Seating outdoors in the summer is a great option, as is their take-out
The food was very good
The ambiance was nice
I can't wait to go in the summer when all the doors are open (or at least they look like they open)
The service was good until it got busy
then it got slow
Overall it was pleasant and I would definitely go again
Jasmine has become a weekly ritual for me
Their Pad Thai is really good, as is the Mee Ga Thi
Their coconut milk soup is also delicious! Pork chop wasn't great, so that's the one thing I would say not to order
They are also good about catering to allergy requirements (i
e
no shrimp
not so sure about peanut allergies, though
) Service is pretty slow, but the delivery is pretty quick
I have been to a number of Thai places in the city but Jasmine is still my favorite
It has the best food
and at the best prices
In comparision Rain's food was horrible at twice the price
I have visited NYC six times and a visit would not be complete without eating at Jasmine's

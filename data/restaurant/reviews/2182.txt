I had soggy fried squash blossoms with a generic tomato sauce, and venison that was overcooked and overwhelmed by it's sauce
My boyfriend had linguini with seafood - the lobster was tough and the sauce, again, generic
Way overpriced, and the staff was aggressively moving us through the courses to boot
Excellent midtown Italian restaurant
Very warm, responsive service in a comfortable, spacious setting
Although they promise to 'make anything you want' I found the lack of a menu or a speacial board a bit overwhelming, especially after hearing the litany of appetizer and entree specials that took the waiter 5 minutes to recite
It also makes guessing what the total bill is going to be a pure gastronomical guesstimate
But the food was well worth the price nonetheless
Wonderful food, They can make anything you wish just tell them, The owner Luige is fantastic!! What a find!!
The restaurant has a pleasant appearance and outside seating is very nice in the summer
The only thing that separates Prime Grill from a good steakhouse is the lack of good steak
The steaks are overdone
If you want medium, ask for medium rare
The food is also unsophisticated
The steaks come with ketchup and French fries
Also, the staff will not allow you to substitute a side dish or accommodate anything that differs from what's on the menu
This restaurant would be acceptable for half the price, but a steakhouse it is not
Truly one of the better steakhouses in NYC and koshe rto boot - The Black Angus pecial on thursdays is the best steak I have ever eaten-
The best steak I have ever eaten
Specifically the reserve cut is amazing
I think that the foodd here is wonderful
They have a wide variety of dishes including sushi
The steaks are big full of flavor
I can't believe that it is kosher
i think this is the best kosher in the whole world
service improved alot
the food was better then ever
the new chef very talented and creative
i ant belive that this place i s kosher,i don't think any body can ever tell
its the best we ever had
we travel all over the world
If you haven't been here make sure you make a stop
Has to be one of the best and INEXPENSIVE places there are in NYC to have great Chinese food
I would like to recommend a few dishes although all of them are great
The Pan Fried Noodle and Sauteed Rice Noodle
Be sure to get their hot oil which tops off any of their meals
Quick service and cheap bill!
When you're spending your own $$, and you want a great Chinese meal within yodeling distance of Grand Central, this is the place
Although totally crowded at lunch, dinner is a quiet time, as most of that business for them is takeout/delivery
Result? A delightfully quiet, good meal for an extremely reasonable price
In particular, the Szechuan Dumplings with Sesame Sauce are the best I've ever had, the Fried Chicken and Spinach dumplings are great, and their Siu Mai and Har Gow are both wonderful and fresh
Actually, their whole Dim Sum menu is great, and only slightly more than you'd pay in Chinatown, with your northbound Metronorth conveyance just steps away
While lacking the romance of The Rainbow Room, the location, quality of food, and low price more than compensate
I've been going there for the past 10 years
Long Live The Oriental Noodle Shop!
fresh bbq meats (cha siew-roast pork, pork ribs both honey sweet tasting), the roast duck soy sauce chicken are as good if not better than c-town (get ginger oil sauce for ss chick)
price incl
tax is $5
35 - cheaper than big mac's 'value meals'
singapore mai fun beef chow fun are good
the other dishes are ok
svc is quick, if solo sit at the counter
lots of regulars
go early to beat the lunch rush
noodle soups good for the winter
i have been a regular for 3 yrs! I've tried about 5 other spots this is the best
SUM IT: a nice find - very good c-town food in midtown prices are reasonable
Hard to find decent and cheap Chinese food in this area, but unless you are part of the midtown lunch crowd, I'd recommend hiking down to Chinatown for cheaper and better fare
Chow fun and singapore mai fun are decent
Roast pork on rice is somewhat inconsistent/hit-or-miss
In Short Inside Nanni, the year could be 1950
The dark-suited wait staff exudes an old-fashioned warmth and courtesy, and the atmosphere is serious and stately--all of which, plus the well regarded food, make it a popular destination for business diners
The solid, classic Italian cuisine includes a variety of fish choices, a host of beef and veal preparations, numerous pastas and risottos and a gentle nod to vegetables
This was one of the best italian dining experiences! Nanni's intimate setting makes for a great, home town feel
The older staff is knowledgeable and will gladly make great recommendations for you
The service was impressive and tended to all questions and requests! I will definitle return and recommend to friends and family!
This is a flawless dining experience
Begin with a rustic cheese board and bruschetta to accompany the atmosphere of this divine old world charm filled restaurant
Allow the charming owners and staff to make special suggestions like little mouth watering, succulent soft shell crabs
Follow it with a decadently creamy mushroom risotto
This place is a little trip to heaven
Horribly tight
Six of us were stuck at a four top where the waiters and customers bumped us all night long
The lighting in that dump reminds one of the dressing room at macy's
The geriatric waiters were rude and incompetent (didn't get pellegrino until after entrees arrived, never brought milk or sugar with coffee even after being asked two times)
We asked for a side of sauce to dip the bread in and were told that the chef doesn't allow it to be on the table because he doesn't want you adding it to any of the dishes
Even Jean-Georges isn't that arrogant
Who does this guy think he is? I will NEVER return to this restaurant
I will admit that the food was good, but you could do better in a city with this many restaurants
If you do go keep expectations very low
For old-world Northern Italian, Nanni may be the best restaurant in the city
Nothing trendy,(you'd think you were in Italy) just superior food and great service
The Angel Hair a la Nanni is the best pasta in New York
They honor reservations and treat everyone special
Sure, it's great food
V
pricey
We had fresh soft shell crab and wonderful cream sauce pasta as a primi piatto
Appetizer was parmasan cheese
Later someone suggested a '94 Chianti Classico
There were 8 of us and came to US$110 ea
Zagat reviewed it well, but I can't see Joe Private citizen choosing on their own budget
Leave it to Corporate America
The Scene The walls are adorned with celebrity caricatures, which is surely a metaphor: the whole place is a caricature of the original Palm
Built in 1973 to catch the overflow from the original, which dates to 1926 and is just across the street, Palm Too is still second best
Though some prefer it for its more spacious and comfortable environs, the die-hards and heavy-hitters choose the original
The Food This place puts out a good-enough steak, and the double steak--an extra-thick New York strip sliced and served for two--is noteworthy
But with so many similarly B-level steakhouses clustered in Midtown, it's hard to understand why there's often a wait to get in
Stick to the steakhouse basics, such as tomato and onion salad, shrimp cocktail, crabmeat cocktail, and New York strip, and you'll do well enough
Steer clear of the attempts at non-steakhouse fare

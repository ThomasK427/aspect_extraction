One of my favorite places
Great food (the bacon wrapped dates and the garlic shrimp are to die for), great drink (I reccomend white wine sangria), and and amazing staff who make you feel comfortable and really quite at home
I've enjoyed every meal, but none more so than the party I threw here just last Friday
Stephen (the owner? Manager?) was wonderful
He accomodated 18 people, worked out a prefixe menu with our tastes in mind, and made sure we had the best of everything
So you can add great for large groups to my list as well!  And did I mention how affordable it all is?
Love the place
You will feel right at home or on vacation in Spain
Great and joyful staff, nice selection of tapas
Food is amazing, it is like in Spain
However, from time to time, I would welcome to see a change on the menu - since I know the menu upside down
Under new management, the Lower East Side is getting a taste of true authentic Spanish cuisine
Starting with the sangria that offers the perfect blend of specially selected Spanish wine and fresh fruits, the first sip will surely take you back to Spain
The Calamares Romana cooked meticulously and I dare anyone to find calamari prepared this well for under $10
The Solomillo is a carefully cooked asparagus wrapped with succulent filet mignon
The 1492 tasting is the super bowl of all tapas because there is something for everyone in this carefully selected surf-meets-turf dish (the oyster was dressed with a topping that left me speechless)
The Ximenez 1971 dessert wine was the ultimate companion to the selection we ordered
The flan is prepared the way the Spaniards intended and the chocolate souffle made our lady companions devour every spoonful
Awful paella
I woke up this morning in desperate need for anything- ANYTHING- good to eat after the awful dinner last night at 1492
Places like this make you think twice about being adventurous
We walked in to try something new since Falai next door couldn't seat us until much later
The seafood paella was bland and all the seafood was well overcooked
The wine list was nothing special and the waitress barely attended to us
Simply put - it wasn't worth it at all
So many reviews cited bad food, but I don't know what they're talking about
I also surveyed many of my friends (self-professed tapas snobs), and they really like this place
Some dishes are a little bland, a little salt does the trick, as opposed to overly salty greasy places like Pippa
I *love* the bacon-wrapped dates
Serrano ham croquettes, seafood paella, paella valenciana, shrimp in garlic (gambas al ajillo), spanish frittata with alioli sauce are all excellent
Bud the cod mushroom croquettes are mushy and tasteless
Desserts are also good - tried all 4
Very accommodating for a dinner party of 13 on a Saturday night
Romantic - wood tables and chairs softly lit with candles, with additional room in the back
One of my new favorites
This place used to be great, lived around the corner ate here all the time
Went last night to sit in the garden - which is lovely - but the food was terrible
Had Lentil soup, Spinach Croqettes, Gambas al Ajillio (shrimp) Chipirones a la Plancha (grilled squid), Patatas Tres Salsas (french fires w/ 3 sauces) and a side of Spinach
Bad food, over priced, bad service
So many great new restaurants with really good food and less expensive
Don't go here
Everyone seems to be doing tapas nowadays, so I was weary of coming here, but I am glad I did
This is the real thing, as authentic as it can get in NYC
I've had many great Tapas experiences in Madrid and this place brought back a lot of fond memories
The two of us shared very flavorful wild mushroom croquetas, classic marinated anchovies, garlic-y grilled prawns and a generous arugula/quince paste/manchego salad - all of it was satisfying
We did find the chorizo, artichoke and manchego torta a tad unbalanced and a little too oily, but it didn't spoil our experience
And we had some of the best Mojitos in town, delicate and consistent, not the sugary mess often found in other bars and restaurant
Excellent and friendly service too
One of my new faves
We made reservations for 6 on Sat night at 8
We were the first ones there, yet waited 2
0 hours for our food
When the food finally showed up, entrees came before appetizers/tapas
Tapas were drenched in oil
The sangria was a rip-off at $28 a jug and mostly ice
The water was warm
The waitress was nice and apologetic
She took one entree and tapa off our check and treated us to dessert
Nonetheless, after that whole experience, we will not go back
There are too many great places in the city to waste time and money on pretentious yet crappy food/service!
Decor: Charming! Rustic decor, wooden tables, candles and commodious chairs
The highlight of the restaurant is the garden in the back
The wall of the restaurant is adorned with vines, wooden fence is decorated with white lights
Service: Very friendly, unpretentious, accommodating and with a smile
Food: Spectacular! We had Dates, bacon almonds, succulent sweet dates wrapped in crispy bacon
Also a plate of delicious tender grilled asparagus juicy piquillo peppers
And to make our taste buds scream with joy we treated them to salmon gravlax with mango
Thinly sliced smoked salmon complimented by thin slices of sweet mango and capers
Black paella with squid ink, even though quite good was least impressive
The seafood was a little overcooked, paella was slightly salty and rice was a little too sticky
Tucked away and discreet,1492 remains untouched by glitz and glamour, loud music and fashion shows
Great place to hang out and have a chat with friends, while eating gorgeous moisty seafood paella, or enjoy the spectacular gambas a la plancha
good music and the best garden in town
I LOVE the wine in their glasses (old fashion way
common sense, different things
I am not afraid of trying new things, actually old things
) not the usual wine glasses, after all you just want to drink!!!
you will see what I am talking about
Its a little piece of Spain in the Lower East Side with servers that bring you back to Catalunia, Sevilla or other Spanish speaking country
you can practice your spanish with them and they are helpful and happy to teach you
and dont forget to try the dates, are also amazing
If you want authentic tapas, this is the place to be
My friend's husband is Spanish and recommended this place to me - can't wait to go back
Make sure to try the croquettes!
I should have known to leave the minute they served our sangria in cups
The sangria was good, but com'on
it has to be served in a wine glass
The food was just average nothing to write home about or recommend to anyone and it was small portions
With the average tapas at $8-$10 it's just not good value
The service is shoddy (sp?), the waitress dropped dirty silverware on my friends lap and didnt apologize they never brought our coffees
This is all a shame because the ambience there is awesome and the back patio looked like a very nice setting as well
I wish I could recommend this place because it has the makings of a good restaurant, yet they come up short on value, service just average food
best tapas restaurant in the city
Very friendly staff! They said they will be opening the garden in the back for the summer - I can't wait!
These were the best tapas and sangria I've had since living in Spain
Truly authentic
The chef is from Spain, so you can't go wrong
The fried calamari is a must!
I had not been to this place in quite a while
It was just as I had remembered

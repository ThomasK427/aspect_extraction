This place is a bit pricey (to pay for the changing installations on the high walls, and perhaps to maintain the famous bathrooms (well worth a look, a stare, a blink of shock, etc)
At night, reserve or come early - it's hard to get through the happy hour hoarde
State law is apparently helpless against the smokers in this dining room
This is a place everyone should check out
Aside from the bathroom the rest of the bar is nice too
The Tartini tastes like cough medicine FYI
Key lime pie was delicious
This place is definitley not for teens
My friends and I just wanted to go there to have dinner, and it was tiny
This is def
not a place for dinner
I was there with my friends few weeks ago and the bouncer asked us for an ID
We are all well over 21
Unfortunately, one of us didn't bring his ID card
Meanwhile these two young people came and they just went right in and the bouncer didn't even care to check their ID
How can you not check their ID but ask us to show the ID? I totally don't understand why and I can only think of it as discrimination
Yeah~ their bathroom is cool but it's not worthwhile to go there at all
I was there few times before when they didn't check the ID card
The service was poor anyway and food?
not so good
If you were to check the ID card, you should check everybody's except for the seniors
This place is wack
The service during lunch is very slow
The sandwiches and fries are nothing to sneeze at, but they're not spectacular either
I've been here 3 times and twice they've screwed up my order
But the ambience is very Soho and the bathrooms are a great novelty
Other than that this place is a bit lame
And the menu seems to be somewhat pricey for just upscale diner food!
I always trek to Bar 89 and get one of their huge sandwiches that comes with fries
Unlike steak frites, these are criss cut and they don't get burnt
They're perfectly salted and taste great with they yummy sandwiches they accompany
It's the perfect fix for a salt craving
I actually think this is a pretty cool place, even if it is way past its time
Yes, the bathrooms are cool
The food is OK and the space is open and fun
But one thing that has really turned me off from this place is the fact that i ordered a Saphire gimlet (or 2) and when the bill came my friends drinks were $9 (top shelf) and my drinks were $16 each
I know NY is expensive and I'm used to spending $12/ drink, but that's at a place where i expect it
I wouldn't even have minded if they had at least told me first
Also, it takes forever to get a drink upstairs
I hope this place doesn't turn into Lemon Bar
I've always liked this restaurant because of its atmosphere
You should go just to experience the bathrooms! The service is a bit slow and unattentive, that's my only complaint!
Good 'Strong' drinks, decent price food, good ambience
Great for after work drinks and dinner
Not smoky or loud like other bars
It was the standard, nice, minimally decorated type of bar with expensive drinks
Don't get the mojito, it was too sweet there, they add ginger ale to it
The mule comes in a great copper mug
The best thing about this place was the ventilation
Many people were smoking, but you can't tell at all
This is a great place for non-smokers who hate to sit in a smelly smoke filled bar
I stepped into Bar 89 around late afternoon on a summer day
I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and expected to be turned away, but I wasnt
Of course I was driven here to see the famous bathrooms, but I ended up sticking around for a few drinks
The dcor is minimalist and modern, almost verging on antiseptic, but it has a good overall feel
I was pleased by their selection of liquors, especially whiskey
Its worth a visit
I've never sat at a table here, but the couple of times I've dined with a friend sitting at the bar have been great
The waitstaff (bartenders included) are knowlegable and friendly, and the food is top notch
The wine list is a little pricey, but otherwise the experience is a good value
8 mile creek is one of a handful of restaurants that we come back to over and over again! Never disappointed by the staff or the food, this place is so great we have had 2 birthday parties there and whenever we have friends from out of town, we bring them to 8 mile creek
It is casual in ambience only -- the service and quality of the food is fantastic
And then, as it warms up outside, no one has a better backyard for bbq
And then there's Coopers
YUM!!!
Highlights of our awful experience:  - When we arrived we were greeted by a rude guy dude at the door
- There was not enough room for our entire party of twelve so we helped the waiter move our mile long, heavy, wooden table
- They sat us OUTSIDE in 45 degree weather
There were two heat lamps that did very little to heat the patio and one died halfway through our meal
we were shivering
One of the waiters brought us jackets from his apartment nearby for all of us to wrap up in
- After arriving at 10:30 we did not receive our food until midnight
- The waiter was working about five other tables and had very little time for us
- When it was all said and done, our check of $750 was comped only $38 for our troubles
I will NEVER go back to this restaurant
I walked into the place, befuddled and wilted by the heat
I asked the bartender to give me something fizzy and cold
I got a glass of sparkling shiraz
Perfect choice! I had a birthday party here and the waiters were very attentive and fun
Highly recommend it!
I've eaten here about 10 times and every time it gets better and better
This past visit was for my friends birthday
she loved it! The sweet potato fries are amazing and the rack of lamb is perfect
Thanks 8MC for making my friends birthday a special treat
My first visit to Eight Mile Creek was Valentine's Day
It will not be my last
The atmosphere is romantic and cozy, the service friendly and attentive- without being overbearing, my boyfriend adorable, and the food is beyond compare
I have found nothing else like it in the city
The authentic food is nicely prepared and beautiful served - just enough as to not be over filling
Valentine's Day included a satisfying 5 course meal with champagne, rose petals and chocolates on the house
I have nothing negative to say
Eight Mile is truly what Australia is all about
Charming with a bit of Ruggedness, Exciting yet Relaxing, Friendly, not to mention mouthwatering food
The staff is truly delightful
I can't think of a better way than to spend an afternoon or evening hanging out with Australians
In the past week I've been to this place three times and everytime I go I meet someone new
I went down a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and we ordered the crawfish appetizer and burger (with the lot) and it was incredibly tasty and delicious
I highly recommend anyone who is looking for something different in the city to check out this place
you won't regret it
It's places like these in the heart of New York that make all the difference!

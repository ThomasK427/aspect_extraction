Chin Chan vegetables include savory caramelized onions, sweet-and-supple red peppers and musky grilled eggplant
Carnivores can indulge in Korean-style short ribs, beef tataki or pork loin
Also tempting are tempura eel, seasoned baby octopus and Malpeque oysters
Had a great time here last night after the Yanks game
The food was great, the beer was cold, and the service was prompt
As always, Forbidden City doesn't dissapoint
Looking for a good date place or spot to have weekend fun
I went here twice in one week and had a blast on both occassions
My girl and I heard from a friend about forbidden city
This almost hidden spot has asian fusion food and my girl loved the cocktails
the dumpling sampler, black cod, and salt and pepper squid were amazing
The employees were friendly and fun
They recommended we come on the weekend to see their nightlife
Second visit, they had a Dj and the place was packed
Great music, great food, great cocktails, and great service
This place is a must for a date!!!! Night life????? I going again friday!
went there on both friday and saturday nights this past weekend
the dj was playing great music the whole night and the crowd was really into it
good looking girls and lively staff
my date and i had the dumpling tasting which was of chinatown authenticity
try the green tea and lychee martinis when you're there
The service was unbelievably slow and inattentive despite the fact that we were two of only four people in the entire place; the waitress spent most of the time talking on her cell phone
The dumplings were absolutely awful- in particular, the beef shumai tasted like something was really wrong with it and the soy sauce tasted like it had originally gone bad in the time of Thomas Jefferson
They also had the nerve to charge 28 dollars for a bottle of revolting wine with a screw top
A SCREW TOP
When I go to a restaurant I do not expect to get a bottle of wine with a srew top, sorry, and especially not for 28 bucks when I could get that crappy stuff in the store for about three
They might as well pull out the ol' box o' wine
Lastly, the floor is made of creaky hardwood floorboards that were really loud and distracting whenever people walked around on them
It was so bad that I truly considered not tipping
This is the first review I have ever written and I felt compelled to do so by this terrible experience
Save yourself from a night where you look at your bill and cannot believe you are about to drop so much cash on such awful food
I love this place-- it's a great bar-- fun, accomodating, and open till 4am!! Not too upscale, but nice enough that it isn't grungy
and very fun!
the minute you step into this place, you know you've been wisked away to the far east
From the traditional samurai garb on display to the authentic untainted cuisine, this place is one of my favorite true new yorker spots
What I mean is the the crowed is always so mixed and eclectic, i've seen celebrities, pro skaters, wall st
execs, service industry people, and even some models
Not only is the scenery asthetically pleasing but the food is uncompromised even at 3am!
My only complaint is that when it gets busy it take a little longer for the food to come out, but that is easily remedied by my fav the sake martini
This place is truly one of the last true spots that has its own unique flavor that people obviously love to taste
I used to live in the LES a few years back and I remember when this place first opened
A friend had a birthday party there last weekend and it is STILL one of the top hot spots of this neighborhood
Where do I start? Food, incredible
I STRONGLY recommend to try something other than typical menu items and go for the short ribs over rice, black cod, sea bass, or duck (there are two dishes that are great)
And of course the salt pepper squid which is on par if not better than even Chinatown's jewel restaurants
The drinks are amazing, the lychee martini, green tea, and mango are awesome
They have an extensive sake menu as well and if you ask they will even let you taste it! The service is impeccable
Friendly, fast, courteous and detail oriented
I love the diverse crowd
I have been to tons of places in the city and there has never been a place like this
The food is orgasmic, the drinks are some of the best in the city, and the staff is some of the coolest people
Everyone that I have ever brought there falls in love after a few minutes in the place from the ambiance to the food this place is definatly my reccomendation
I came here last week and the service, food, music, ambiance, owners, everything, was exceptional
Forbidden City has a great selection of sake's but don't forget to also try the lychee martini -- mmmm, made to perfection! the place is good for a late night snack and with the bar being 'U' shaped, it's perfect to be checking out the good looking crowd and waitstaff, including the kind and cute owners
forget the lame cover-charging lounges, i would definately come back here again!
Went there on a Saturday night and got seated at the bar, right before the mad rush of barhoppers came in
The food came out late, but we didn't notice since my date and I were enjoying our Sake and martinis (hint: try the Lychee Martini and the Last Emperor)
Before we got our entrees, we asked the waitstaff if we could get seated in the dining area, since the prospects of having dinner with a bunch of people doing shots behind you isn't very pleasant
We were seated promptly and when our entrees came out, Paul, the owner, apologized for the delay in our food coming out and took it off our bill
Now that is exceptional courtesy especially since neither me or my date complained about it
Every person we interacted with there was extremely nice
oh yeah, and the food was awesome too
I've become a fixture at this place b/c the owners and staff are so friendly and always having a good time
The vibe is like a house party, everyone is having fun and new faces are always welcome
The food is amazing
Where else can you find a pan-asian cuisine with uncompromised flavor and quality late at night
The staff are good looking, so is the mixed crowd
People start filling in around 11pm, so find a seat or you'll be standing for the night
The owners are gracious hosts, they know everyone who comes in the door, and if not they make it a point to get to know their clientelle
Plenty of eye candy
Lookin for a party like vibe, but dont want a $20 cover? forbidden is perfect, no cover, excellent food, good looking crowd, friendly owners, great music, and one my favorite places in the city
I have been going to FC for a while now and the place is just amazing! From the owners, to the bar and wait staff to the guy who cleans the dishes, everyone there is really cool and friendly
The food is very tasty and a perfect compliment to the excellent cocktails that are unique to Forbidden City
If you're not into those, they also have a full bar of regular liquors and some fantastic beers
I don't know what the 'nightmare' thread is talking about but I had my party of 35 ppl and had the best time ever
Music was great and so was the mixed crowd
The servers were very accomadating and informative
They also sent us a couple round of shots and the owner came out to personally wish me a happy birthday
I definitely recommend this place for parties
It's a pretty nice and cozy place to chill with friends
Hip-hop and RB music in the background
It can be loud sometimes
It's somewhat of an asian hang out place though
The Lychee Martini was yum-yum good, and the bartender was sooo nice and sweet
The waitresses were also very prompt in taking our order
We had scallops and squid appetizer
The serving were small, but tasty
Worth going
I have been going there for a few years now
The management has changed but the Bartenders and Food is still tops
I meet there with friends everytime i go to the city and drinks like the Rising Sun and Green Tea Martini are always a winner
Carefull drinking the Makers Mark - harsh:) Give a kiss to Johnny for me if he's working
i have SO much fun at this place everytime i go with friends! the waitstaff and bartenders are knowledgeable AND SUPER CUTE --- especially rich :)  the kitchen is open late, the food is amazing, they have a DJ or band playing almost every night
the place is perfect for birthday parties
I'm in love with this place
I go once or twice a month and have brought many different friends
All were impressed
The food is all good
I've tried almost the whole menu
Nothing disappointed

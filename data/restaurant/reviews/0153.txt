The service was terrible, our waitress rarely made an appearance, and never checked on us
Outrageously overpriced
I could have stayed home and had a better steak and a bottle of wine for 1/10 the cost
A shameful experience, and I sense that most who have rated it so highly know nothing of steak, good food, or fine dining
The food was mediocre and far too overpriced
The waitress came by once to take our order, but we had to get her attention the rest of the time
We were not promptly seated, despite having made reservations
It was loud and overcrowded
I would have liked to order the lobster, but it was $130, for the SMALLEST portion they had
The wine list was marked up 400% over retail prices
Overall, it was an unpleasant experience, and I certainly wouldn't go back there again, let alone take anyone else there
We went here for my friend's 20 year work anniversary
What a great surprise!! The staff were very friendly, the place was very crowded, yet we had excellent service during the whole meal
The fried oysters were fabulous and they make the the best crab cake I have ever had
This is the perfect place to come with a group from work, people from out of town, or just to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere
I will definitely be going again
It was great to go somewhere that was not disappointing
Food, Decor were good (not sure why anyone would consider this excellent), decent wine selection too
however- I personally refuse to make any effort to dine at any restaurant that cannot stick (within reason) to the reservation book
I understand that thursday nights are busy, but please, please, please
do not take the reservation at 8pm to begin with, if in reality the management knows that it will be impossible to seat at that time
Actual seating time
9:15
I prefer an honest we are fully booked then be forced to wait in a truly overcrowded bar for our table
And I was not blown away by the food
If you're looking for a great steak in a lively setting, this restaurant should definitely be on your list -- particularly mid-week
It's perfect for corporate dining, but romantic? Definitely not
Service is rather quick and the bar gets pretty loud
It's not ideal for a special occassion unless you're of the eat, drink, and be merry mindset
You have to sit back and take what comes, because if you're picky and are apt to complain, you're likely to find something wrong
Just have fun
Really, I can't get over how crowded this restaurant is -- even in the summer! Surely they're doing something right
Del Frisco's steaks are absolutely superb
They are impossibly tender and flavorful, and the oysters were also very delicious
The wine list is also very good
This is an ideal place for business
I've personally closed many deals here and I've frequently ran into many of my business associates here
Ladies if you're looking for a room with a view, this place is for you
The men outnumber women 10 to 1
The prix fixe menu is the best in the city
A 8 oz filet, with salad, size and any dessert for $35, but hurry, its only offered until 5:30 and after 9
Where do I begin? The steak was so tender you could cut it with a fork
We had the best seat in the house on the second floor looking right at Avenue of The Americas
The waitstaff was courteous and knew the menu extensively
When the food came out, we were bum-rushed by 4 waiters and waitresses and the food was cooked perfectly to order
When we were done, same deal, we were again bum-rushed and the table was cleared in the blink of an eye
The restaraunt interior was designed magnificiently with a great view of the Avenue
And to finish it off, we all got mailed cards handwritten out by our waiter and waitress
We shall return!!!
I have been to Del Frisco's soooo many times and everytime has been excellent
The service, environment, and the STEAK is always up to part
I love it and will continue to go to enjoy a great meal!
Ate there last night with my wife and her mother and grandmother
Ordered the 12oz filet, which was superb
My mother-in-law's prime rib was also delicious
However, my wife unfortunately is a vegetarian, and there was NOTHING on the menu for her
THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:  1
Bar area is a major after-work hangout for the trendy business types, and is EXTREMELY busy and loud
2
All of the food is SMOTHERED with butter and pepper
3
PEANUT ALERT! For those allergic to peanuts (like me), keep in mind that the fried foods are cooked in peanut oil
4
The waitstaff is extremely attentive
My grandmother-in-law had a problem with her meal, and the manager AND chef came over and offered to replace it and/or take it off the check
In short, don't expect the best experience ever from a steakhouse, but DO expect a great steak and exceptional service
What a disappointment after reading all those great reviews
Way overpriced, too loud, and not what I would call a very good meal
It took my body two weeks to fully process the sodium and butter used for flavor out of my system
And the lemoncake was straight out of a diner's rotating refrigerated glass case
If you want a topnotch NYC meal, look elsewhere
This is what I would expect from a chain restaurant
I've been to most of the big steakhouses in city and this is by far my favorite
It may have a long wait on Friday and Saturday, but that wait is well worth it (it also helps that they provide comfortable chairs to sit in)
Once you get seated, the service is excellent and is only matched by the wonderful food and heaping portions
It was truly a great experience and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great steak
Is the food and attentive service at Del Frisco's enough to make me want to make myself a regular? Absolutely
Are the good looks and knowledge of our server, Brenda, an added bonus? Definitely
I went to Del Frisco's on Sunday and had, quite possibly, one of the best meals ever in New York City, and I've eaten at a ton of restaurants
I ordered the prix fix which was enough food to last the Olsen Twins combined six months (read: Mary-Kate would skip the dessert)
Everything was tasty - the salad, the steak, the potatoes, the heaping portion of lemon cake
I would reccommend this place to everyone: great food, attentive service and an attractive waitstaff - a combination that is rare in NYC
all the waiters are so damn attentive
if you are left alone at your table they have fluffer walking around making small talk w/the patrons untill your party has arrived
Great wine selection
Recommend sitting either by the windows or on the second floor by the edge to get the view
I have been eating at Del Frisco's for many years
I lived in Dallas where the original resturant is and can say this location is just as great
The best steak in New York
They melt in your mouth
The crab cakes are to die for and the drinks are just as good
The sevice and quality of the food is always excellent
I have never felt rushed
The tables are not on top of one another
It is so wonderful
Can't beat Del's in any city that they servce
Food is always wonderful, service is always Great
If If you were ever to have any problem what so ever, they will make it good without hesitation
In New York we love the table that is refered to as The Point
If you are ever in Dallas store besure to ask for or say hello to Bush

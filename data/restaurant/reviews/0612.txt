They serve real Italian food
The pizza is thin and with the proper amount of toppings
They offer a wide selection of entrees and pizzas
The decor is really nice
The prices are extremely reasonable given the quality of food and the type of restaurant
The wait is often long but it's worth it
We are from Italy and it's one of our favorite places in the city
We deliberately reserved two tables of 6 people each for a corporate event to retain our ability to order from the regular menu
Despite having 2 free tables in close proximity, the unapologetic manager refused to keep our parties next to each other because of the potential to cause disruptions
Our only alternative was to sit together and order from a fixed group menu @ $40/person
At an avg of $9 per item on the menu, this was a steep charge for a narrow menu
Had we known, we wouldn't have reserved the two tables and would have gone elsewhere
The food was good, but be forewarned about the service
We felt scammed and did not expect such behavior from a quality Mario Batali restaurant
Extremely overrated
For a much better pizza/win experience try Gonzo
Had dinner with here a group of people and had a great time
The wine is terrific and I really enjoyed my pizza
The best part of the meal was the gelato, of course
Try the olive oil and the goat's milk! Will definitely be coming here again and again!
We went last Saturday for lunch and had a wonderful experience
The food was delicious, the wine list is extensive and reasonable, and the gelato was the best that I've had in the city
Our server was very knowledgable and attentive, and made sure that we had a great time
My family and I had a great time at this restaurant
The food is very interesting, very hip, just what you expect from a great chef - even though the menu and ambiance are very relaxed
The wine list was outstanding and the service was acceptable
This is exactly what you look for in a big city
trendy, interesting, and fun
Our compliments!
Otto has been my savior any night of the week! Wether i'm dining alone at the bar, meeting friends, or eating with my parents
The menu is fantastik, and always a delight
The staff is enthusiastic and smart
Bartenders always remember me and are quick to say hello, and make great suggestions
The only downside is the occasional chick complaining that they don't have drinks like sex on the beach I have to hold myself back when I hear that, and try not to say, uh yah, you wanted BBQ's down the block
I give Otto an A+++LOVE IT! I think I could be happy forever if my freezer was filled with pumpkin gelato!
We have been to Otto several times over the last year or two because it can't be beat for the food and value
We have never had a problem with waiting for a table (we usually eat between 5:30 and 8pm) and the food is great especially considering the very resonable prices
The desserts have gotten better since the place opened and I'm happy that they now have some great pasta dishes on the menu (less than $10!)
I highly recommend this place for casual dining, reasonable bills and great food
I've been to Otto at least 8 times in the last year and have always had excellent food and service, even when it was insanely crowded
The best time was on Sunday afternoon, when it wasn't packed, and service was more leisurely
The food is always fresh and interesting, and you can try a lot of small dishes without spending a fortune or getting too full
The kitchen isn't afraid of smelly cheese, salt or animal fat, so if you don't like strong flavors this isn't your place
But I love it and I wish there were more restaurants in NYC where you could eat intelligent, affordable food like Otto's, along with a killer wine list
What is with the service in NYC lately? We had a business lunch at Otto recently
There were only 2 tables in the back room so you would think you might see your waiter
No way
We ordered our drinks and food from the waiter never to see him again
Our food was never cleared, we sat there for no fewer than 30 minutes with dirty plates waiting to go
When the busser finally cleared them, we waited another 20 minutes for the waiter to bring our check
He literally walked by us a bunch of times never looking over
Get over yourself
The food was ok, portions small but that is ok because at least you weren't overly full
We should have gotten the pizza, it was the only item no one complained about
Pasta was ragu like
I travel from Northern New Jersey to get my Otto fix
Dennis the head bar manager knows us by name and Mark and Allen always make sure everything is perfect
Healthy wine pours in miniature carafes always make me happy when i can order my favorite Nebbiolo by the glass
Their selection of cheese and meats are the best antipasti-opt for the wine pairing
We always recommend otto to our friends and they all go back
I'm dazed and confused, I sat next to a group of whankers from mtv, highlighting how great it is to rip off the young people and get rich, and then the food I had ordered was so gross, I just couldn't finish it
I had to lie to the bartender that I was full
Even they knew it looked hideous
I thought I was going fishing for sardines in this small portion appetizer which had stale croutons anyhow, calamari appetizer looked like slimy worms, disgusting and the onion salad was filled with onions
Really, I just couldn't stomach it anymore
Had an awful experience at Ottos, for three appetizers, two glasses of chilled white wine, my bill came to $60
Though Otto is mostly gone to the bridge and tunnel crowd these days, that doesn't mean one can't enjoy it, especially since you get top-notch food and service for prices far, far below, say, the Time Warner Center
Be sure to try the cheese plates, served with excellent condiments, and don't even consider skipping desert
Great place for big groups - or even a date
The food is good - but contrary to typical Italian, they don't load up your plate - portions are small, but it allows for you to get a wide range of items
Great scene, and you have to love the Italian-style train terminal sign that flashes names of Italian soccer teams to let you know how long you have to wait for your table - in the meantime you can hang out in the spacious bar area
I have been there 5 or so times and have yet to have a bad experience, except when we played credit card roulette!
Friends brought me here on a Sat
night and our group of 5 was seated immediately
Great wine list, grouped by region of Italy which was fun
Delicious, not-too-funky cheeses (very little mold)and condiments
Good selection of vegetarian antipasti
Pizzas were simple but delicious, however many of them had neither sauce nor cheese so beware! Service was attentive and friendly
A great place to go with a group and *DO NOT* forget the antipasti
getting seated is a hell of an ordeal at dinner
being stuck at the bar while waiting is just as irritating- skip drinks since they're slow to return change and it only keep the hostess waiting impatiently
otto's inspired by an italian train station, which is why bread/breadsticks are served wrapped in paper/prepackaged
a cute idea in theory but an unappetizing way to start off
that said, the pizzas are great
but god help you if the person at the next table orders the quattro-formaggi (do i smell a dead body? oh, that's just the taleggio
) other food is served in too-small portions, but at least it leaves room for dessert
the olive oil gelato is worth all of the hype
this is the one place i refuse to skip dessert
your best bet is to go for a nice lunch so you can linger and receive attentive service
Food was average at best, however, service was even worse
After spending about 2 hours in the restaurant our waiter decided to call it a night without even asking if we wanted dessert
Hey, I'm a size zero - I could use some dessert!
i dislike my otto experience more as the hours move on
A wannabe chic, trendy place, the menu itself screamed pretentiousness
The unfriendly, self-important service is probably mandated by management since staff took on the personality of the entire establishment
When one of our party brazenly asked to substitue a flavor of gelato for one of the desserts on the menu, the waiter snobbishly told us that, Mario and the chef don't like to do that
As if everyone knew who Mario was
This of course, after the waiter told us dessert was pre-made
the food is neither tasty nor reasonably priced ($137 for four with one glass of wine total?)
Going here is equal to a trendy, velvet rope club where you pay $20 to enter, only to pay another $9 for a drink with no liquor in it

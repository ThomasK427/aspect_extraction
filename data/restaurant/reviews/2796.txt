Not special, but consistent and solid for many years
which, in itself, can be pretty special
I'd feel sad to see that place go
The food is definitely quite good
The ambiance is clean and unpretentious: there are plenty of art works portraying Argentine cowboys (gaucho means cowboy)
The service is good: the waiters are friendly and the meat, especially the bife de chorizo and the entrana, are delicious and tender
I've been here many times and it was worth it always
I've been to this restaurant a few times with my mother who has started to take an interest in a healthier lifestyle
I've always enjoyed the food
For breakfast there are a wide variety of whole grain pancakes; pumpkin is my favorite, blueberry second! For lunch and dinner there are lots of choice of tofu and tempeh dishes as well as eggplant parmigiana, etc
The house salad is delicious
The atmosphere is calm and soothing and the restaurant is located on a hidden away street in a residential are
Nice
A group of 6 of us always go to Quantum on a friday night for a good time
We never have a problem getting a table never get rushed out after our meal
I am not a vegetarian am not a fan of healthy tofu type food so dreaded going here my first time
Now I love it ! It's very cheap, food is great you can bring your own bottle of wine (saves sooo much money) The waiters will uncork it bring you glasses too ! Most of the items on the menu are under $10 dollars
The only con is the waitstaff isn't the most attentive I've had to ask them to clear the plates off the table
I am not a vegetarian, but my bf insisted that we go try it
We ordered some food, and it was all that delish
I was not impressed with the food, and left hungry
I'm not a vegetarian I was very pleased with the meal
I had a corn chowder non-dairy, crispy seitan parmigiana no sugar, dairy apple pie, it were very good
The food was very good and the service was excellent
The price was also very reasonable
After finishing your meal, you can drop by their natural food market next door for organic all natural grocery
the food here is terrible
not enuff flavor, too many veggies not enuff meat, chicken, seafood
Im asian living in fresh meadows and i would not recommend this so-called chinese food to anyone
I highly recommend the other chinese take out on 69th ave
definately on my top five list of best Chinese food in and around NYC
I live near this place so I usually get food from here delivered
Delivery as almost always speedy and ALWAYS accurate
Prices are, like, 20-50 cents more than similar items at nearby places but the quality of Jade Fountain's food is head and shoulders above anything nearby
As a place to eat at it's ok considering that most of their business it delivery or take out
Don't expect to be pampered
The food is the main attraction
i highly recommend jade only because its the best chinese takeout in queens
as for the reviewers who complain about the service, what service do you expect from a takeout????
Jade Fountain is the best chinese place in Queens
The food is great for takeout
Only one complaint
the service sucks
The Brocolli in Garlic Sauce is a must
I have been eating at Jade Fountain for many years now and the food is always of exceptional quality and is consistently delicious
For a take out restaurant, the food is as good as any upscale restaurants in Manhattan!
Their food is amazing
Their pizza is to die for
Although their spaghetti could use a little more working on and their prices are a little high it's well worth it
I grew up in the neighborhood and came here almost everyday for lunch while attending PS 26
A fresh slice from the oven cannot be beat
When I'm away from home I miss this pizza more than anything
The guys behind the counter are great people - and they're ITALIAN!!!
Everyone thinks that their hometown pizzeria is the best
But only people from Fresh Meadows are right
FMP is the way pizza should be
I've been here a few times, and it's definitely one of my favorite places to eat
Their hot and sour soup and duck dishes are excellent!! I don't have any complaints about service, and the parking is great
Unknowingly, I did go to karaoke night once, and I absolutely disliked the dinner experience
It was so loud that I couldn't hear myself talk, and my friends and I had to almost scream to talk to each other
Make sure not to go to the karaoke night, unless it's something you want to do
my waiter was corteous helpful and not pushy but always available when i needed
he anticipated our needs
we requested extra juice on or ginger lobster and he brought a steaming bowl of it
A family favorite for 3 generations
Always great food and service
If karoke isn't your thing, request the right dinning room on Wed or Fri evening
Went years ago to karoake night
Hostess/owner or general manager was so rude I almost didn't go in
She screamed at us $10 per person - okay!!! 5 or 6 times as though we were retards
I was very embarrassed
Then the waiter was rushing us through all our mediocre food - hovering and taking our plates while we were still holding a fork
A friend recently asked about their karoake so I made a call for her to find out they still had it on Fridays
I swear I got the same rude woman on the phone - she screams Yes it's $15 per person plus taxtip - minimum, so 2 of you $30 plus tax and gratuity!! She's just too abrasive for me, or maybe she's hard of hearing
Well, karaoke or not, I won't be back to King Yum
Some things never change
Without a doubt, the BEST Cantonese Restaurant (with some terrific Szechuan dishes as well
) I have tried since LUM'S closed in Flushing many years ago
If you love Hot n' Sour Soup, THIS IS THE PLACE
Jimmy Eng is the last of a Great Breed of restaurataurs
However, I can do without the Karaoke nights!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The food here is really good, whether a traditional Chinese scallion pancake, Chinese mixed seafood with garlic sauce or Japanese shrimp tempura maki and eel
This is definitely place is definitely worth coming to
Enjoy!
I was greatly disapointed by everything about Slyfox Inn
The fried calamari was filled with battered and had no taste, the crab cakes had no crab meat and filled with flour
The french onion soup was watered down and tasted worse then canned soup
I ordered the steak medium rare and they cooked it medium well, when I asked if I can get a replacement, they told me they had no more steak and that this was their version of medium rare
I had a few bites of the prime rib and it was not good
The only thing that was good was their side salad
The ribs were great, cobb salad was huge and had so many pieces of (real) bacon but was rather salty
Unfortunately, the crabcakes tasted like fried batter and the Oreo cheesecake was too rich to swallow
Our booth style seats would've been more romantic if our waitress, though nice, was less intrusive, and the loud music from its bar didn't filter thru so much
But the bar was also the best thing about this place: It had a dance floor and great DJ
Prime rib is delicious and the price is a steal at $20
95
The carrot cake is the best I have ever tasted
A very good meal at the right price
This restaurant provided me with one of the foremost dining experiences I have had to date
The food was delicious, and the menu provided ample choices which suited all of the eaters in our party from the most daring to the most conservative

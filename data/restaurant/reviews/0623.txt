I need to get in this place more often
My boyfriend had been dragging his feet to take me out here and I'm so glad he came through for our 2 year anniversary
The place was so fun and romantic
Points for my man and points to the staff
I've waited tables for years and know how it can be on a friday night in New York
Staff was friendly and quick
It felt good to be taken care of
The food was delish
I'm coming back with my girls!
My friends had been raving about the breakfast/brunch at this rising staple restaurant on the Upper West Side
The expectations all came to fruition on my first visit
The dining room was lively and full
Our wait wasn't too bad; the bloodymarys making it all the more bearable
Although very busy, our waiter had our entire meal under control
I never felt forgotten
The breakfast fare is some of the best I've had this side of Central Park
Eat Sardines, Pistou,Merguez sausage,Cod, Short ribs,Bouliabase, more Bouliabase and clever Cheese
Easy and attentive wait staff
Helpful wine
This is well worth returning to for repeated and new pleasures
It is unfortunate that such a great place is taking that slow slide into the Manhattan abiss
I have eaten here on a regular bases starting when it opened
It seemed to me to be ironing out it's problems and then became a fairly good restaurant, however now it seems to neglected or past it's prime and sliding into mediocrity
I hope it can make the turn around again
My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to celebrate our 6 month anniversary and friends recommended Nice Matin
What a great place!We shared a bunch of delicious appetizers (all reasonably priced- the eggplant was my favorite) and then She had the steak and the best fries ever; I had the cod- amazingly good
We shared a lavender creme brulee- heavenly! There was a crowd but the service was smooth and attentive
We've not going to wait 6 months for our next visit
Had a great little dinner with a group of out of towners last night
Took the advice of a friend to go here and will recommend it myself
The lobster gnocchi is out of this world
Good cocktail list as well
Last night some friends and I were looking for a place with good food and a fun feel
One of the group suggested Nice Matin
What a great find ! My overall favorite was the pumpkin ravioli
The onion soup was the proverbial meal in a bowl- delicious and filling
The wine was reasonably priced and the selection was wide
There was an electricity in the air- the crowd was typical upper West Side -smart, eclectic, and savvy
This restaurant knows its client base and serves it well
I'd recommend reservations since this is a very popular spot
Nice Matin is a wonderful addition to the upper west side
The decor alone is worth the visit! I was greeted with a smile upon arrival and the positivity of the staff continued throughout my meal
The food is moderately priced and wonderful; in presentation as well as quality
The staff is extremely knowledgable of the extensive wine list and menu
I had a fabulous time at Nice Matin and intend on becoming a regular!
Can't get past the attitude of the servers and cold food
This was my first time and my last time eating here
To many great restaurant in Manhattan that cost a lot less with halve the pomp and surcomstance
Fabulous food
Try the cod
It's all delicious
Service is above average
Can be hard to get into be cause you always have a great meal
One of my favorite Upper West Side spots
Anyone who loves food would be crazy not to dine at Nice Matin
Before Nice Matin opened, the upper west side was void of refined restaurants
I eat here on a regular basis and always find a smile at the front door, great service and food that is sure to please
There's nothing more warming than the pistou soup on a cold autumn day
Just in from a Columbus Day out on the city and had a marvelous dinner at Nice Matin on the UWS
There is something about a fine bottle of wine and good old fashioned dining that is part of the New York Autumn experience
This place is on the money and I recommend it even to those downtown
The steak frites is worth travelling for!
Ok, so Amsterdam Ave
is not along the Cote, but it is a great place to have a Sunday Brunch
There's a classy joint with the namesake of Nice's Daily there that really transported me over the Atlantic
New York is full of theme restaurants and this is not one of them
It takes authentic to be authentic and the chef and company here have created something special
I want to come back for dinner and see if it lives up to the other positive posts on this site
If so, I sure hope this one sticks around the neighborhood
We return again and again to Nice Matin

the food is SO GOOD! Flavor and quality never disappoint
Even we're with a crowd, there is something delicious for everyone - vegetarians, seafood lovers, or hearty meat eaters! Wine list and cocktails are imaginative and chosen with care
Our last trip was a Saturday 2pm - one of us wanted the GREAT burger, the other, in a brunch mood, had the outrageous salmon benedict
Washed down with blood orange juice bellini
great
Nightly specials are wonderful - I encourage you to partake! A really happy environment - and a smart and friendly staff
Once we were there and it started raining, with many diners seated outdoors - the transition accomplished by the staff was miraculous - people were re-seated indoors within minutes - not a hint of chaos! Check out the menu if you want to be enticed!
I love eating out in Manhattan
I stumbled into this restaurant by chance and liked the look
After being sat promptly I wait for every thing else
The time between aptz and entree was way to long
I think this place with a little focus and dedication could be worth while but is definetly not there yet
I went to Nice Matin with mixed expectations due to the reviews here, but we had a lovely dining experience
Despite our waiter being new, he got everything right and our food was delivered in a timely manner
The bitter greens salad was large enough to be an entree and my salmon was delicious
My dining companion works in the restaurant industry and enjoyed her time as well
We had a 9pm Sat
night reservation, but showed up a little after 8pm to see if we could be seated early
They accommodated us right away without any wait
ok amsterdam avenue
but you'll totally get the feel of a french bistro the moment you walk in and are greeted
This place has a great vibe, the guy at the handles it with ease, panache sarcasm and all in a charming way
the service is really wonderful too
you must ask for Keir as your server
the special shrimp app was to die for and the lamb ravioli kills pair it all with a good btl of vino, finish it of with a trife and your hooked
I usually stay downtown, but was visiting a friend on the Upper West Side
She took me to Nice Matin, and we a great experience from start to finish
We didn't have a reservation and after waiting a while decided just to eat at the bar
But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise, thanks to two talented and charming bartenders, both named Alex, for their delicious cocktails and food/wine recommendations

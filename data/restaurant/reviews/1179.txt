) so we had no trouble being seated right away and we received our food promptly, so I didn't experience some of the issues other people complained about
I found the service to be friendly and attentive
The one disappointment was some of the food
The kobe beef burger, snapper tacos, and lobster roll were all very good
However, I found the french onion dumplings to be overcooked and really not that tasty
The sea bass satays were also a disappointment--for 16 bucks the bass seemed of low quality, you only got three small bits, and the sauce was mediocre
The drinks, though good, were also over-priced for the quality
Anyway, I'd go back, but keep in mind that the food doesn't live up to the hype and prices
I have heard of many great things of Stanton Social - so my friends I decided to go
we were waiting for one person the Host told us we weren't able to sit til the final person got there
Mind you, the place was EMPTY (this was about 6p)! instead of being seated, we had to sit at the bar (upstairs)
If the restaurant was busy, I could totally understand, but the fact that it wasn't left a bad taste in my mouth
I was pretty interested in trying out their kobe beef burgers
it was good, but it wasn't all that nor was the price for it
Do not get me wrong, this place is nice, the food was fine - just not worth it for me to go again, yet the desserts were GREAT - but that's about it
this place is nothing but a hype
I had a great food experience
Fun, different and really good
But the music was so loud i couldn't hear a thing
The food is meant to be shared but you have to share in silence because it's impossible to have a conversation
We asked 3 times if it was possible to lower the music all 3 times we were ignored
Don't seat in the mezanine i guess
the speaker are right there
This is a really trendy place with an exceptionally ecclectic menu for all palates
We came here on a Sunday night for a late night meal around 12am and were seated promptly (we had reservations)
Our waitress was so ridiculously nice and courteous
She made several suggestions and even steered us away from a few items
They were, sadly, out of the beef carpacchio but everything else was great
We had about 7 or 8 small tapas plates and then two kobe mini-burgers with fries
The drinks were also quite good
I got the classic mint julep and it couldn't have been better
Everything was delicious and well priced
Our bill came to just over $130 after tip which was fine considering the amount of food we got
I was on a first date
Of course we were late and our reservation got lost
Because we were just two, we were given a table in the lounge in just 15 minutes--but it was tiny--i didn't think it woud work at all
I gave my waitress, Mae, alot of attitude (i was a jerk), but she was great
Mae assured us that she would work with the space and that we would have a blast
She recommended our cocktails and essentially chose our whole meal
everything was delicous and on top of it all she was hilarious
Between her service and the great dj, my date was salvaged
The only con to the night was that the bartenders were so slow
we would order drinks and wait forever to get them--luckily for us, the waitress helped us pick a great bottle of wine and that problem was solved
the dessert was worth every penny
I shared that with one other person
I loved the fish tacos and the tuna
of the plates I shared only 1 was not fabulous
we had a great time
It might be crowded and annoying, but If you have a reservation, get there early and go upstairs to the bar
have the drink special I had was a 'blood orange margarita' for $7, a bargin for the Stanton
Sure the place is allways packed but it's only because the food is awesome
You have to get to know the menu to know your favorites (snapper tacos) It' a great way to try something different with your friends the more people you go with the more dishes you get to try
dessert is to die for (donuts!)
we had reservations for a friday night at stanton social
the decor is nice, but the tables are VERY small and it's very crowded inside
you can't get up from your table without bumping the people next to you
it's small plates style, so we ordered a bunch of dishes
the kobe beef sliders were completely mediocre- you couldn't taste the quality of the meat, it was like getting white castle! we had a seafood dish as well, which was just average
the wine we had with our meal was good, but the waiter was extremely slow to refill our water and wine, and we had to call over different waiters nearly every time we needed something because our original waitress was nowhere to be found
that said, the ambience was nice, if a little noisy
A few friends and I had a reservation for an after-work dinner at 6 pm on a Wednesday
As we were running a few minutes behind, we called on the way over to assure them we'd only be a few minutes late
A very important hostess informed us that they could only hold the table for 15 minutes, and after that we'd have to see what we could negotiate
We got there at 10 after 6 and there were TWO parties seated in the whole place
Give us a break
We were seated, and the food was above average
Walking in the look of the place was great, then the greeting
talk about rude hostesses! We were there with a group of 10 people and sat upstairs
Trish, our waitress was really great - the food was mediocre
I don't see what all the fuss is about
There are many more 'trendy' places to go where the food fits the billing
I don't think I would go there again unless someone else made the reservation and HAD to go
We decided to check this place out for brunch since we live right around the corner
Service, food, and ambience were all fantastic
We especially loved the cinnamon poundcake and the Huevos Rancheros
Can't wait to try it for dinner!
decor - good
food - great little things with super taste
service - ok
I went here with my boyfriend and his sister in law and we had such an amazing time!!! We started with drinks upstairs and then went downstairs for dinner
We had such an awesome waitress and the food was great to share
I would come back with girlfriends, my parents, couples, or just my b-friend again! It's cool trendy it's NY!
Much talk about Stanton Social and recently went for a friend's birthday
We were a rather large group and essentially had the 2nd floor all to ourselves (1st floor - dining area, 2nd floor - more of a half floor - extra dining seats), 3rd floor - bar area)
The decor is industrial and simple
The waitstaff was good and the food was great - yummy
Since we were a large group, we tried essentially 60% of the menu - since it is tapas oriented
The kobe burgers are fabulous as is the paella cakes, tuna tartare, duck empanadas, red snapper tacos and the ceviche was GREAT
The only thing that was disappointing was the french onion soup dumplings - blah
The price was reasonable and we had a great time
This is a place to please everyone
Because of the sharing concept behind the restaurant, you don't end up with one mediocre entree
The waiters are great at helping you to determine how much to order
I always feel like I ate enough, but there's never leftover food on the table
Most dishes are delicious (esp
french onion soup dumplings, kobe beef sliders, lamb shank soft tacos)
I have eaten there several times with many different groups of people and it is always a success
They also serve a nice brunch on the weekends
The decor is gorgeous!
I just had my birthday dinner for 14 people at Stanton Social

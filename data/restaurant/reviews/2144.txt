I almost always choose to eat family style and don't forget a pitcher - or two of the excellent margaritas! Main suggestions: the chicken parador is excellent (order early, can take awhile) - also suggested, the shrimp quesadilla, lava cake, and the jalapenos filled with peanut butter may sound odd, but I prefer this over the cheese ones now
I lived across the street from this restaurant for years before finally going in one evening for one of the best meals ever in New York City
Not only is the food excellent, but the presentation and service is excellent, and Alex is one of the most amiable and funny Maitre Ds in the City
If you love margaritas that aren't too sweet or taste like they've been made with petrol, this is the place
It's not trendy or hip, and that's fine with me
Guaranteed to please is you want, great food, great atmosphere and service without attitude!!
i've been eating at el parador for almost 10 years and have yet to be disappointed
the food (from the pork chop to the chips and salsa), service, and the margaritas are all tops
while this stretch of 34th street might be a little bare, this restaurant is worth the trip
Nice out-of-the way joint
Solid cocktails, food and service
Nice nieghborhood feel
Very pleasant maitre 'de
The grilled double-cut pork chops, excellant
Reccomended for margaritas in a glass, reserved atmosphere to talk
This is Mexican without the frat house
I've eaten here several times and always been happy
The Prix Fixe around $25 is a terrific bargain, and I've had good salmon and pasta dishes
Sat for several hours with 2 friends from work the other night without anyone trying to move us along
A good choice for French bistro food in Manhattan
we stumbled on to the restaurant on a rainy evening, and had an OK dinner
We had the Pre-fix dinner- onion soup, I had the salmon, she had the hnager steak and we both had the pear tart
The soup was Ok, the crounton awas too salty and buttered and the cheese was a bit too much, the slamon was decent, but the pureed carrots and potatoes were not very good
The tart was too sweet and caramelized
Dine if you must, but there are better options
My wife and I recently had dinner at Le Cafe Creme Madison
Our favorite food is French food
The food at Le Cafe is the best I have had in a number of years
Le Cafe is now at the top of our list as one of our favorites and we now place that at the top of our list when in Manhattan
The service leaves something to be desired but it is well worth it for the delightful dining experience and great food
My regards to the chef at Le Creme and keep up the great work
I had dinner here last night with some friends to celebrate the Holiday season
The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is very friendly
It seems as though all of the staff works the whole restaurant, as we received service from several different people
The food was delicious and the prix fix is a great deal (only $20
95 for 3 courses)
Because we all ordered different things, I was able to sample the grilled salmon, hanger steak, crab cake, seafood ravioli, and the duck pate
It was all delicious! The only weakness I would say the restaurant has is that it needs to expand its wine list as it was rather limited
I would be sure to make a reservation though, because it was packed on a Wednesday night
This is NOT french food: the pate appetizers tasted like spam, the steaks were overly salty, the pasta was overcooked, the creme brule had a synthetic orange sauce added to it (like those orange vitamin pills you took as a kid!)
Oh, and the service was hurried
Don't go
I know I'll never return
Domenico's is a consistently good restaurant that my firm uses frequently because of its great food and private rooms
The waiters are very friendly and have been there forever! Another bonus for my firm is that the restaurant provides audio/visual equipment which makes it very easy to plan meetings
When my wife comes in from the burbs she always wants to eat at Domenico's because of their unsual and spectacular pastas
The last time she had home made Pappardelle with Duck Ragu', and the time before my favorite, Lamb Lasagne
They were both awesome
I always have the fish special and it is always great
In five years of working in this neighborhood I never been disappointed at this restaurant
It does get a little loud if you end up next to a party so call up in advance and ask what's going on that night!
I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! The food was fresh and the pastas were excellent
My office had a large dinner party and everything went smoothly
Highly recommend!
Maybe I was sitting next to you beacuse I was flabbergasted I spent $125 on such a AVERAGE italian meal
In seriousness, I could have made some dishes better myself
Poor service, depressing atmosphere and for that kind of money Im sorry there are way too many better Italian restaurants in NYC
Do not go here again
I wont
Wait staff was inattentive and spread thin (two for the whole restaurant) even though it was only about half full
The menu was way overpriced and the quality of food is just average
Each plate was $38
00 and we didn't order drinks
The price wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the poor service, average food, and uninspired menu selections (choice of tiramisu and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert?!)
The waiter took forever to take our order
We weren't asked once if we were enjoying our meal or if we needed anything
I dont know if they had a bad night, but most of the staff looked like they would rather be elsewhere
We will not return or recommend Domenicos to anyone we know
There is a long list of better, more reliable, more reasonably priced Italian restaurants throughout the city
In one word, depressing
I chose to have a surprise dinner soiree for a friend
After learning about DOmenico's through City Search, I called for more info
The staff members were extremely helpful
They assisted in coordinating a truly memorable event
All 16 of my guests raved about the food
They baked a cake for the party which was absolutely delicious! Thank you so much Mary and Jack (the owner), I thoroughly enjoyed working with you! The only complaint I heard later was that one of the waiter's accidentally hit one of my guests in the head while passing food
I had no such problem!
Well Domenico is just that, not bad
I don't know why there are so many 10's (I'm kind of suspecting that they are written by the staff)
The place has good food; very fresh and big portions, but unless you are into retro decor, this place is a bit too old-school (Domenico's seems like the perfect dinner location for Godfather part IV)
The waiters are charming, as long as you don't go too late, and the place is very comfy
Like a previous entry, Domenico is quite the old slipper
The prices are kind of steep for non-five-star restaurant, but the portions and quality of the food makes up for it
Don't expect a posh crowd, but do expect a hearty meal
I've been to many restaurants that have great good, atmosphere service
Domenico's has all three with an extra bonus
a waiter named Livio
Even though it was our first time to the restaurant and we did not have a reservation (the place was packed) he moved tables around and created a table for us that wasn't there when we came in
We felt so special, like one of the family
I could tell by the way our fellow diners spoke to him that we weren't the only special customers
What a find!!
Domenicos is a charming, old fashioned restaurant that seems like it might have been here for 100 years
As my friend put it, eating as Domenicos is like putting on your favorite pair of old slippers! It is a seductively comfortable environment to experience fine classic Italian dishes
I had a small order of fusilli with radicchio sausage to start and my friend had the mixed mushroom pan roast
Both were superb! Domenicos veal saltimbocca is a very refined version of my favorite Italian classic
Suprisingly, the most outstanding dish was not a classic at all: the fish special of seared yellowfin tuna with soy ginger sauce on a bed of lentil salad
Unexpected in a place like this but truly an inspired dish! The waiters were friendly, and very professional
Prices are not cheap, but quite reasonable for the quality of food and service
We recently dined at Domenico for a friend's birthday dinner
We chose Domenico based on the 3 raving reviews this restaurant had

Don't pass up the gnocchi with pheasant ragu or the pappardelle with the duck ragu, both dishes are on par with some of the best pasta dishes at the top Italian restaurants in the city
The carpaccio's are great as well
And if you're a tiramisu fan, it's a can't miss
Eaten here 2x the past month
The food is OUTSTANDING
The duck Ragu over Papperdal and the braised beef over Penne are unbelievable
Both dishes were plentiful and rich in flavor
I would compare the Duck Ragu to the same dish they USED to serve at Union Square Cafe 3 years ago
The veal cigars over asperagus was Ok (i'm not a veal person)
The lamb shishkabob was good, and the Filet mignon was perfect (served with rosemary)  APPS: The Polpetine was VERY flavorful and I recommend it
The beef carpaccio was some of the best I've eaten - tender and very flavorful
Atmosphere: Italian country house setting - very relaxing, some tables are oversized which is a rarity for NYC rests
Staff: Very friendly,accommodating,and entertaining
- Angelo (host?) presented my table with complimentary Tiramesu on my second visit (he remembered me)
First off, teach the servers how to open a bottle of wine
They are frightened of demonstrating any kind of skill in front of a table
Seriously, a good waiter can open a bottle away from a table and keep confidence, however, this place is basically, rustic italian, which means, thank god americans think being italian accounts for something so basic mistakes can be overlooked as idiosyncrasies of an 'exotic' cultures
Good intentions, Great gnocci, however, tomatoes, potatoes, and basil do not encapsulate the italian culinaray experience
Save that for NJ housewives
My girlfriend spotted this lively and bustling eatery on one of her neighborhood strolls
When we got there it definitely lived up to her description: high energy with a great ambaince
After a delicious 3-course meal my only complaint was the poor time management of the operation: an inept hostess that had neither the ability to provide accurate wait time estimates OR to politely shuffle out those tables that lingered incessently; an over-worked waitor that had a difficult time juggling all his tables with balance and ease; and the kitchen/runners that rushed out our appetizers and then took a half hour to produce a slice of tiramisu
While the busboys were by far the most punctual, the culinary expierence overshadowed all of the negative aspects when looking back at the entire experience
Great food, great wine, great price, great service
The restaurant makes you feel like you're not in NYC
Will return to this one for sure
Went with a few friends for brunch, the food atmosphere were terrific
The back garden area is wonderful
Will definitely return!
Get the stuffed calamari if it's available - incredible
The food is light and delicious; it's more of an olive oil than a heavy sauce restaurant
Great atmosphere, very affordable - 35 for 2 if you stay away from wine
Waiter was a little grumpy, but probably bc we stayed away from the wine!
It was such a fantastic dining experience, that I returned again the same week
The food is wonderful, artfully done and simply delicious
It's a fantastic interior and excellent vibe - wooden tables, exposed brick, and an outdoor area in the back is an amazing paradise for dining al fresco
Even the waiters and bartenders are having fun
Save room for deserts - they're to die for
Boldo Vino is one of the best additions to come to the east village in years
The food is amazing, as if your Italian grandmother was in the kitchen slaving for days
The tastes and aromas whisk you back to the Tuscan country side and the staff is charming and personable
The wine selection is fantastic and the decor is perfectly rustic
If you don't try the Gnudi you're insane! To top it off the prices are more than reasonable! Hands down the best Italian food and experience in the city
We were alerted to this place by a waiter (I think he owns it) whilst dining at Max
Having waited a while, seems word is out: it was the only place with more than ten occupants on a lonely Tuesday evening in the East Village
The place is very aesthetically pleasing, with solid wood bar and a welcoming vibe
The waitress let us taste three wines before deciding (we were only ordering glasses) and then we chose to eat at the bar (same menu) since it was so comfortable
The calamari was out of this world (it's sauteed instead of deep-fried), and we also shared the layered celeriac dish, which was awesome: fresh and tasty
It is higher-end than Max, coming in just above $25 for one course and two glasses of wine, but it's one of the few places where it's worth paying that bit more
Highly recommended
If its good enough for Meryl Streep, its goodenough for me! My black ravioli was superb and my glass of white Colosi I had with it then 2 tables down I saw Ms
Streep eating with somebody
That was the topper! When the food is good and the waiters and bartenders are nice and you see someone so famous right near you it lets you know where you're eating is someplace special
Cool spot
the food was pretty unusual for italian: sardines with pinenuts, but delicious
Modern but warm decor and equally good looking staff - the real Italian kind, black wavy hair, green eyes, blue eyes
Service was fair - could have been more attentive, but they were pretty crowded with people waiting, so that could be it
At least they were friendly, busy but with a smile and they didn't rush us from our table (I hate that!)
My friend and I shared a pasta that was melt in your mouth fresh and I had a special fish
Overall I'd say everything was tasty and creative
Not cheap, but less than I'd pay in Manhattan
Good looking crowd too
A keeper
Could be a really nice restaurant if they sent the staff to charm school
Why be in business with the public if you don't like people? As a former waitress, I go out of my way to be polite to staff and never ask for special requests
I was treated like a criminal for not having a reservation, was told to sit in the bar, even though the dining room was empty, and then told maybe they could seat me in the dining room - to which I replied that my party had to make a train, and therefore would not be lingering
I thought that would be helpful information, but seemed to infuriate the manager? owner? jerk in charge? so we sat in the bar
Ate our food quickly - though freshly prepared, it was entirely uninspired - and left
The dining room was still empty
Thanks for nothing
My friend and I went since Scopella was highly recommended by her friends
Scopella was great
I had the mushroom ravioli
fabulous
Our host
an ubberly cute, salt and pepper hair, aqua-eyed Italian named Fabrizzio (I apologize it that is misspelled)
met us at the door upon arrival and walked us out at the end of the night
Fab knew exactly what we wanted before we even asked
He recommended the dark chocalate moouse for dessert--it was great--and brought the perfect nightcap at the end of the meal
Will be back, often
Sunday May 29 - I was in Fort Greene for Dance Africa festival and i went to Scopello for a drink, attracted by the crowd that loocked like a group of friends, at the and of my first drink i was already part of it, with everybody talking with me like i was a regular
I also order a delicius tuna carpaccio
I only went for a drink but had such a good time, i ended up staying 4 hours!
Waiting for the day that the Downtown BK/Fort Greene dining scene is as good as Smith Street's, I was hopeful upon walking into the welcoming, colorful dining room but I wondered why there were only 3 tables seated in the entire restaurant
By the end of dinner, I realized why
The food was very good for Brooklyn but by the end of a 3 course dinner, my boyfriend and I were both sort of hungry
We would have liked to share a third entree, but then dinner would have been much too expensive, and probably better spent on a cab ride to a better restaurant
Note to the management - reduce your prices by 25%-30% and you can probably expect the place to fill up nightly
I had the best caipirinha outside of Brazil at Scopello, :-)))  thanks to Marcia, the Brazilian-Italian bartender i like this place:  good food lots of fish, and great drinks
The decor is beautifull
love it !!!
My best friend and I lived in southern italy for 18 months and loved everything about it - the landscape, its warm, funny people, and incredibly delicious food
So when she started raving about this Italian place, Scopello, that had just opened up in her neighborhood, I knew I had to go
Scopello lives up to the hype
Gorgeous decor! The food was amazing, with all the distinct flavors, and spice combinations of the south
The service was careful and the owner is friendly and so funny
We had a great time
I've been several times since and often recommend it to friends
My friends and i had diner at scopello, after the theater
We wanted to try this new joint in Fort Greene that everybody is talking about

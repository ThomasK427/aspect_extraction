Nice decor, abmiance and excellent service!
This restaurant is certainly one of the best I have been to
Everything we ordered - from appetizers to desert - deserved a 10+
Although it was a bit pricey, it was well worth it
I enjoyed my meal overall at Marseille
It was a dark, relaxing environment to dine in
The duck was delicious, and I especially enjoyed the desserts we ordered for the table: The special of the night, a pear with chocolate soup, and the chocolate steam cake
Went for pre-theater on a Saturday night, everything was delicious, haricot vert salad, duck, chicken with couscous, short ribs and veal cheeks
Only thing we didn't like was the steamed chocolate cake with mint ice creama group of the 4 of us did not want to finish this dessert! The place was a bit noisy, but sitting on the edge of the restaurant helped, and although the portions were small, w/ an appetizer it was the perfect amount of food
I'd go back, and my out of town guests were definitely impressed
Service was a bit spotty, but we got out the door with plenty of time before the show
It reminded me of a restaurant in Marseille or even Paris
The wait staff was knowledgable in wine, and the level of service is compatible to French
It's very romantic with redish dim lights all over the restaurant
Superb
This is the word to qualify my experience at Marseille
The service, the food and the wine made our experience memorable
I had the tasting menu with wine paring and honnestly I could have compare it to any of the top nyc restaurants that I have eaten at
The bread and olive butter alone is worth a trip to Marseille
We found Maraseille on Citysearch as they were picked for the bes french restaurant
The food was surperb, it was in near Broadway and the waitor eas attentive and funny
We had three bottles of wine, all new for us and delicious, thanks for a fun night!
I go to Marseille as often as I can for brunch, and it's never let me down
The Croque Madame is the best I've ever had
The French Toast is so moist it doesn't need to be drowned in syrup like at other places
The most essential brunch item, coffee, is fantastic
And my sister raved so much about the pancakes to the rest of my family, that they all ask for them when they visit the city
Marseille delivers inventive food and excellent service so I'm surprised that some other reviewers have had such unfavorable experiences
I've been there twice and on both occasions had stellar service
The first time I called to make reservations, the host chatted me up about what show I was coming to see, and when I called to reserve a second time, he remarked that they'd look forward to seeing me again
While I know they do this with computers, it made me feel welcome nevertheless, and when I arrived that evening, they greeted me with welcome back and used my name
For some people this might be overkill, but I appreciated it
My waiter - on both occasions - was very accomodating, and suggested just the right wine to complement my meal
As for the food, the chef does brilliant things with Mediterranian ingreidients - The meze plates are particularly scrumptious
Overstaffing is hardly ever a problem anywhere, and maybe here it's just the staff's deployment, rather than numbers
Came by apres-theater for a late supper and enjoyed a tasty and varied (if a trifle salty) bouillabaisse and a glass of wine
Food was quite good, but the service was a trifle peculiar and disorganized
Everyone was attentive, but nobody seemed aware that the other waitstaff also regarded our table as their duty, too -- hence, we'd be asked for orders several times, or, after we'd been told that the lobster salad was unavailable, we'd be asked if we hadn't gotten it yet by a waitress clearly prepared to go and scold the staffers who'd been remiss on our behalf
Pleasant, all in all, but not entirely organized
I had lunch there and had an unusual sandwich of veal cheeks with gruyere cheese and horseradish
Yum
And the chickpea fries are both unusual and delicious
The Scene Reflections from the subterranean moat shimmer on the brick walls of the dining room at this hyper-designed downtown destination
One lower-level room is surrounded by water, while the other is a cavernous sky-lit chamber with brightly painted walls
Up on street level is the dim, often crowded bar area where you can enjoy tapas and a casual drink without committing to a meal downstairs
The Food Suba serves as a New York ambassador of the exciting contemporary cuisine of Spain, which combines bold flavors in an artful way
A meal might start with the pure flavor of grilled sardines, or an exquisite tart of tomatoes, olives and mild goat cheese
Proceed to succulent cannelloni filled with zucchini, mushrooms and cheese, or a thick chipotle-marinated tuna steak on a squash tortilla
There's also saffron-roasted duck with pineapple and a fruity monkfish seviche that couldn't be better
After reading the reviews here and noticing that you can have a good or bad experience, I decided to take my girlfriend here to try it out
We went 8pm on a Sat night and sat downstairs in the Grotto
It was a nice setting for the first 20 minutes until it started to fill up, at which point the noise was unbearable for such a small space
We ordered appetizers off the menu, and they were average to say the least
My sashimi was just ok with very little flavor from the sauces they supposedly put on them and the napolean had something that stuck out in the flavor, not in a good way
On to the entrees
I had the special lobster, which to call a lobster was stretching it
At $40 and maybe 1
1 lbs, it was hardly that
It was bland as well and certainly left me hungry after finishing it
The only good part of the dish was the paella latka as I liked to call it
My girlfriend had the paella on the high recommendation of the waiter, and this too was a disappointment
I forgot to mention that all of our food was rushed out to us in a fashion never before seen by me in NYC
Apps were out in about 5 mins and entrees 10 mins after the apps were done
We certainly felt very rushed and our Sat
night dinner ended after only 1 hour and 15 mins
The plus side were the drinks, we had the blackberry red sangria which we both enjoyed
All in all I would not recommend this restaurant as it is very overpriced for the quality of food and the ambiance, while interesting, is extremely noisy (we had to literally yell to hear each other) which makes you bored of it very quickly
There are a lot of restaurants that are just as interesting with much better food than this
Was there on a Tuesday night and had a great experience
Staff was knowledgeable, fun and very nice
Space is amazing, truly unique
Food was better than expected given some of the postings below
Great dessert with fried dough and molten chocolate
Must try
Highly recommend for a date or dinner with friends
Yes, the place is really cool to look at, but the food
unauthentic and sloppy
and the service
horrible
The people who work here seem truly miserable
I just don't get a good vibe at all
The cocktails were good though! I'd recommend going for drinks, but that's about it
Was a little worried about this place as it seemed hit or miss from other reviews, but love Spanish/Latin food and had to try while in NYC
Had reservations and was seated when we arrived
We were seated in the back room (the one without the moat), but I feel like this was almost better
As the 'moat room' is a little cramped and the back offered a more secluded/romantic area
Good Mojitos and Sangria, great food
Shrimp Ceviche app
was fantastic, and the saffron ice cream for dessert was divine
The only bad part of the night was the service, and this wasn't horrible just not up to par with the rest of the restaurant
I've been to Suba twice, once for drinks and recently for dinner
It was a great place to have a drinks type of party and we greatly enjoyed the interior
I naturally expected dinner to be just as good, unfortunately seating is as everyone has said very cramped
If you dont mind eating with the table up against your rib cage you will be ok
Food also was minimally Spanish or tapas like
And the waitstaff has very little knowledge of the food, they served me the wrong dish and no one could identify what it was that they gave me, someone said pork chop, someone said lamb, and then they insisted it should be fine since it was the same price
Too bad, its nicely designed
The food was fantastic
The atmosphere was beautiful
I held a party for 10 there and had a great time and the service was just flawless

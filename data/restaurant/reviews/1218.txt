try the black pepper tuna tataki or the soft shelled crab appetizer
you won't be disappointed
I have tried all of the sushi restaurants in Williamsburg (including the many pan-asian restaraunts that serve raw fish) and Samurai is the only legitimate sushi resaurant in the neighborhood
The freshness of the fish will match any Manhattan esteblishement short of the very finest five-stars, and the preparation and presentation are top-notch
Specials are garunteed palate pleasers, and the roll selection is creative and well priced
They also have some good sakes to sip with your sushi, and some great desserts for afterwards
My personal favorites are the a-la carte sushi and sashimi choices (when available the uni, live scallop, ama ebi and other more exotic specials are outstanding), but my girlfriend prefers the rolls, especially those of the spicy-crunchy variety
Williamsburg has a lot of choices for exotic cuisine, but when it comes to quality sushi Samurai is the only choice
I love their sushi- so fresh
The rolls are very creative
The sushi chef is great, his suggestions are never a disappointment!
THIS RESTAURANT IS AMAZING
THE FRESHEST SUSHI IN TOWN
THEY HAVE WEEKLY SPECIAL, THEY'RE ALL AMAZING
I LOVE THIS PLACE, NOT GOING ANYWHERE ELSE FOR SUSHI
i cant believe how great the sushi is
the freshest sushi i never had and the best sushi chef i never met
he is so creative, the presentation so nice, he would make whatever i asked for
the staffs were so friendly with smiles
everything is so excellent
The Scene The aroma of hearty home cooking fills the small, subterranean space lined with plaid wallpaper
Relaxed neighborhooders treat the spot like a second home, calling the staff by name and lingering despite the smallish bar and hurried courses
The Food Don't expect many surprises; comfort and familiarity are the specialties on the all-American menu
There are a few creative touches, however, like tiny pasta tubes lending texture to sesame-tinged tuna tartare, or lobster chunks enriching the macaroni and cheese
Reliable burgers hit the spot, and even light eaters will be well served by a lemony sole with two little scoops of mashed potatoes
Desserts like chocolate pudding or a brownie covered in caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream are made daily
i'm not from new york but i've been here twice and will definitely make an attempt to go back
terrific food, friendly service and staff, and i love the patio in the back
if i lived in new york, i'd get monkey bread every week
highly recommended!
Jonez should be added to Citysearch's list of best bloodies in NYC
Each one is handmade from real, fresh ingredients and spiced to perfection
Definitely try the Bloody Bull a shot of beef bullion added to a classic Bloody Mary
This place was recommended by my good friends that frequent this place
and now I can see why
Its a place that you discover by walking by, or you're privvy to word of mouth
Anyway, food was excellent - I had a great fish taco to start followed by a filet mignon , baked asparagus accompanied by a blackberry desire
the staff are very friendly and made us feel very welcome
I'll be back and I'll be sure to tell my other friends about this place
I'm sure you'll do the same
I went last Friday night with a friend and had the BEST time
The lobster macaroni and cheese and is off the CHARTS!  The staff is wonderful
If you don't have a good time at this place, then something is wrong with you
If you don't live in the neighborhood or frequent the bookstore across the street, you would have a hard time spotting Jonez
This neighborhood hideaway is perfect for a drink or coffee jonez before or after a booksigning
It is also a great place for a marriage proposal - the staff will certainly cooperate with any plans you make to suprise someone!! The owner is expecting his first baby, but the atmosphere is very Greenwich Village and comfortable for all
Must have the brownie sundae - I think it is on the South Beach diet - and a Plaid drink is a great new invention on the bar menu
I've eaten here 4 times now
The place is great
They use great quality meats for everything
The burgers are great, the steaks are great and deserts are amazing
Anyone that thinks this place has any issues is probably a little too fussy
The staff is friendly and the owners are very friendly
Now that I think of it, I'm going there tonight
The service is anything but homey and welcoming
the waitstaff was rude and inattentive
the menu is the perfect mix of comfort food and delicious lighter choices
great ambience
i loved it!!
Discovered Jones by accident last week walking by looking for someplace for brunch
What a find! I read the other brunch review and couldn't disagree more
We did a wait maybe 10 minutes for a table but that's not such a big deal -- more likely a testament to the food, service and atmosphere
Given that it was Mother's Day and we had no reservation either that's not so bad
The service was very friendly and prompt
We ordered a couple of bloody marys -- likely the best I've had in NYC! The food was excellent as well
Try the Waffles Foster and the French Toast with strawberries
And the Monkey Bread is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I'm sorry the other person who posted had a bad experience because I'll recommend Jones to anyone looking for an excellent brunch in the West Village!
Don't know who wrote the other reviews, but Jones was fantastic
Great cozy little place, tons of character
Good service and the food was simply fantastic and more than reasonably prices
If you want a place to go where the food is great and they will end up knowing your name and treating you like family, Jones is it!
What a charming place! Finally a West Village restaurant that is charming, romantic, with great staff
I felt I was visiting friends
The owners are ever present and actually remembered my name
That feels pretty good in Manhattan
Furthermore, the food is fantastic
I've been there a number of times and it has been consistently great!!! The tuna tartare was spectacular, The steak AWESOME and I must say I'm still thinking about that warm chocolate brownie with caramel sauce
By the way, there is an adorable back garden that they open when weather permits
I'm looking forward to spending many summer evenings there
Check it out!
Where else can you get a luscious, tender steak at a great price? I'll tell you where, Jones on Greenwich Ave
Whilst eating my succulent steak with a side of chop salad (topped off with one of their amazing chocolate brownies), i was surrounded by stylish, yet comfortable decor with a lively group of diners
The ambience of the restaurant was high and the service was impeccable
With friendly waiters, great service, and great food at a reasonable price
Jones is the place to be for a great meal
I couldn't of asked for better, me and 3 other friends checked out this place after it was recommended by a work colleague
The brunch was fabulous! We all enjoyed the food, staff and mood/vide of the place
I highly recommend
Great place for a date also, I'll be back with my girlfriend
Thanks, keep it up!
After reading TONY's review for new brunch spots I was very excited to try Jones
They sat 6 of us at two small tables shoved together in the front room (it would have been nice had I known there was a great patio in the back)
I had to wait 10 minutes to get water and actually had to go to the hostess stand to grab menus for friends that showed up a few minutes after me
Our waiter ignored us, and even refused to bring out monkey bread mentioning they were out and baking more
A minute later the same waiter brought the non-existant bread to another table
When our (cold) meals arrived (after 30 minutes) I had to request an additional plate 4 times
It was the worst service I had experienced in a long time
What a find
we found ourselves viewing the menu to a little ella fitzgerald playing in the background
When we decided on steaks, mac and cheese and homemade potato chips, we could have never wished for better fare

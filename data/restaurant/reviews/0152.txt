Staff is highly professional
Only drawbacks are the price, and the fact it is always unreal crowded
The crowds, however, are simply a sign of how good the food is
I really cannot say enough about the food
Try any steak on the menu
Sides of mushrooms and mashed potato should not be missed
I recommend finishing any meal with a chocholate dessert and a glass of Ice Wine!
our group of eight came here on wednesday for dinner
the place was very loud, and the first floor bar sort of overflows into the dining area
i think that the second floor is better if you prefer a quieter environment for dinner
our waitress brought us loaves of warm soft bread that we tore apart with our hands
we all ordered steaks most of us got the ribeye, cooked medium rare
when we got our steaks, there was a collective sigh of appreciation as we all took our first bites
their steaks are well-seasoned, verging on salty
i believe that they might be cooked in butter (because it tasted like it) though i cant be sure
regardless, the ribeye was perfectly marbled and came framed by a nice layer of fat
i also had half of the strip steak - it was less tender and a little more dry, but it was also slightly more flavourful
i couldnt decide which was better
for sides, we opted to split 2 orders of mac n cheese (a daily special that they have everyday), spinach, sauted mushrooms, and potatoes au gratin
the mac n cheese was very good baked, so it came with a nice crispy cheese crust
the other sides were nothing to write home about, though there were no complaints either
most of the table was too stuffed for dessert, but a few of my friends decided to get the flourless chocolate cake a la mode while my bf i split the six-layer lemon cake (supposedly a special)
our lemon cake looked pretty lacklustre when it came cold unadorned, but it tasted really good
it was enveloped in a smooth layer of sugary icing, and there were alternating layers of spongy airy lemony cake and lemon filling
the bill came to roughly $65pp, including desserts (but no alcohol), which is about normal for good steakhouses in new york
ive been to mortons, peter lugers, sparks, smith wollensky, uncle jacks, palm, but i think that del friscos steak tops them all
I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation
Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems
The service was excellent and the food was delicious
Bring your appetites
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy
Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's! Try the cheesecake!
The waitress explained the specials and even gave us the prices
My friend orders the Ribeye
On the menu, it is listed at about $31
The waitress than says, 'Do you want it 'on the bone' or 'off the bone'? It is really much 'tastier' on the bone
We went with her suggestion
I was somewhat upset/shocked when the bill came
The Ribeye on the bone was $54
95, almost 50%
It was embarrassing, especially since it was my friend's birthday
I did not want to question the bill in front of him
I did feel scammed and ripped off which totally effected an otherwise pleasant dining experience
I really hate feeling this way,unaware that we had ordered a SIGNIFICANTLY MORE expensive meal without being told
I wanted others to be aware to avoid this happening to them
Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse
We did have to wait at the bar for approx
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy
The point is, the steak was phenominal, the cocktails and sides perfect and the price
much less than what we expected to pay
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks
Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts
I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner
The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat)
The sides were ok and incredibly salty
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out
The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect
However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill
Finally! Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic? Still, this place actually manages to outdo Sparks and SW etc
on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you won't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers
how good this place is
Anyone who wrote a bad review is lying or is used to eating food prepared by a personal chef
The steak was fantastic; the creamed spinach, crabcakes and macaroni and cheese are phenomenal
The restaurant itself is beautiful and unless you are a stuck up type, the noise levels are not at all so bad that you can't still have conversation and enjoy the person you are with
The service is also a plus
Excellent restaurant
The only problem at all comes with the price, although when you eat at good restaurants in NYC, expect to pay way too much
Enjoy
I had a reservation for lunch yesterday at 1:00 and we were seated immediately
Our drink orders were immediately taken and the overall service was excellent
The steaks were cooked perfectly, the vegetables were delicious, and everything was served hot
I've noticed that a lot of the bad reviews focus on how incredibly overpriced Del Frisco's is
My 12 oz
Filet Mignon was $35
95 and a glass of wine was $9
95
I have absolutely no idea where these people are eating in Manhattan where they think that this is atrociously expensive
From the remarks of some these reviewers, you would have thought that the steaks were $100
00
Do youself a favor and ignore all of the bad reviews
This place is great!
I love Del Frisco's and their fabulous crab cakes
The martinis are huge, the steaks are perfect, and I have yet to find a better wine list in New York
This isn't exactly the place to have a quiet, romantic evening, but if you want a quintessential NYC experience complete with great service and a killer view, go to Del Frisco's
I went to Del Frisco at 5PM withour a reservation
The maitre'd said sit at the bar and we'll get you seated as soon as we can
Waited an hour and asked again, host said we'll get you seated soon
Waited another half hour and asked again, host says don't know when we could sit you, it's very crowded tonight
My fiends and I spent $200 at the bar and no seat
I have no problem of waiting for a table when a restaurant has good food but to be lead on that I would be seated soon and then told there's no estimate of time to be seated, that's ridiculous
I've been to other steakhouses and I never received a seating problem without a reservation
If they were busy, they would tell you the wait is 2 hours and you can make the decision to stay or go
This is not the best steak house in New York, it's not even close
The steak was overwhelmed with butter, I could hardly taste the meat

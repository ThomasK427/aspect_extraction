AND ALL AT A SUPER AFFORDABLE PRICE
2 THUMBS UP SAZERAC HOUSE!
Best hamburger in creation
Great crowd
Real friendly place and great location
I moved to south Florida about 3 years ago, and the one thing I can honestly say is that I miss Sazerac House most of all
The food is wonderful, and a tremendous value
Barry, Deidre and Crew also work very hard to make you feel at home
Everytime I think of the many many many wonderful meals I had there, my heart fills with warmth and my stomach fills with hunger !! Stop by and tell Barry, Deidre, Phillip and Brian I said hello
The Sazerac House is the quintessential Old New York restaurant
The decor is dripping with charm
The service is casual and friendly without leaving you wanting
The menu is diverse, and the food is great
The winelist is small, but interesting and extremely affordable
we went there Sat nite with a large group, they were soooo nice and accomodating! the food was great too, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, wonderful comfort food! we called in advance and had a pre fixed menu, and were treated extra special! i highly recommend the Sazerac house!
I've been going to the Saz for years
It is a very good neighboorhood restaurant
Unfortunately, the more they get to know you, the less respect you get
I remarked to the owner about the size of a serving, one that I order day in and day out, and he got quite abusive
Absolutely no respect for a regular and quite generous customer
He reminds me of the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld
Not only is the food generally sublime, the lunch specials make it all oh-so-affordable
Even the most mundane dishes are prepared with care and ingenuity, including the imaginative quesadillas and piquant fish and chips
The Scene The literary-minded tourists and the local lushes who haunt this joint on weekends know that Dylan Thomas may have been Welsh but it was the scotch that killed him
At the site of his debauched death, various portraits of the poet hang on the dark-paneled walls while indifferent regulars focus on the task at hand: The White Horse has stayed in operation since 1880 by serving its customers one drink at a time
The Food In a health-conscious century, it's as likely to be the pub grub as it is the booze that does you in
Nonetheless, White Horse's full-flavored burgers, delectable grilled chicken sandwich and slab-cut fries are worthy of poetic excesses--and perhaps even early death
The appetizer classics, leaning heavily on the common denominator of "fried," range from excellent (amply stuffed potato skins and sharp jalapeno poppers) to uninspired (lukewarm buffalo wings)
Not much decor at this old-time drinking establishment
There's a nice outside seating area, a small bar area with 2 tv's and an internet jukebox and 2 small separate rooms for dining inside
The food menu is somewhat limited, but inexpensive
Beers are reasonably priced, $4
50 for a bottle of Coors Light
Only cash is accepted
The bar area can get crowded very quick since it's not a large room
Not a bad place
A year or so ago I was here and I do have to say the service was pretty rude and not very service oriented
I happend to unexpectedly be there on a Monday during the day and I had the best experience
The bartender was really nice and the waitress was the best I have seen there
She also took her time to talk to us and made sure we were happy
The food has always been good and it still is
They have added a few new sandwiches to the menu as well
I had the roast beef and it was awesome
I will definately be there on a Monday very soon
We came here after work and were not just told, but obnoxiously yelled at by the staff that we couldn't be in the back room unless we were sitting, yet there were no more chairs
The main room was too cramped to fit anymore people anyway
The people that were sitting were forced to order their drinks at the table instead of at the bar
That's how we do it in NYC, one employee rudely told my friend who is from NY
This wouldn't bother me as much if it were a posh hot spot, but this is a crappy, cramped, nothing special pub with RUDE employees
I honestly would rather go to a whole in the wall in the middle of no where than ever come here again!
whhhhhy must the staff always be so rude?!? the beer selection is good, the food cheap and decent, the outside seating great, and yet the staff acts aggressive before you even step foot inside
i dont get it
It's truly amazing that so many people come to this place and act like they've never been out before
As a longtime neighborhood resident I can say I love this Place and its staff
If you carry yourself in a responsible manner (no howling, sidewalk drinking or trying to discreetly sneak a cigarette at the outside tables) there shouldn't be a problem with the doorman
Informing you of the rules is not rude
I personally don't like drunken loud people standing over me in the dining room
There is nothing better than sitting at the White Horse bar on a weekend afternoon and letting the world come to you
Here are the locals and here too are tour groups who are coming to take a piece of New York home with them
A great juke box, a fine selection of beers and some nice conversation make for a great time
Service with an attitude
Management without any consideration for the paying customer
The waitress tells me 'You'd better have cash becasue we don't take credit cards'
The bar is silent unless you put $ in the jukebox (as I did)
When I couldn't hear any of my selections in the dining room, the manager told me that the broken speakers in were 'not his fault'
Finally, the manager had the audacity to lock the doors, presumably to prevent us from skipping out on the bill, while one of our friends went to an ATM to get cash
They got the cash that night, but I will NEVER return
Skip the White Horse Tavern
There are a bevy of better places right nearby!
I am not exaggerating when I say this is TRULY the WORST experience I have ever had with restaurant service
After ordering a couple beers from the pleasant bartender, my date and I took a seat at one of MANY vacant tables next to the bar (The bar stools were full)
An waitress snottily informed us that the tables were only for those ordering food
Her animosity was undeterred by the many empty tables (not to mention the fact that we had just paid $20 for beer)
I asked her where exactly she'd like me to go? Thats your problem, not mine
When we didn't immediately jump to her orders, she had the malice to send the bouncer over to harass us! Absolutely disgusting! Unless you enjoy paying for harassment, GO ANYWHERE BUT THE WHITE HORSE TAVERN
While the food, the beer, and the overall feeling of the place is great, the owner needs to do some serious training with his staff
I like to go to a pub to relax, not to be told where to stand, or to get a dirty look when I ask for ketchup
The food and beer make up for it, but it would be nice if the staff weren't such buzz kills!
while not a juicy as the corner bistro a couple blocks north, the white horse burger is still top notch, and there usually isn't the wait
it seems cleaner and the staff is nicer, too
On a night when you'd rather leave the Prada at home, jeans and t-shirts fit right in to this rambling wooden bar
You will seldom set down an empty beer before another pint is layed beside it, and the dark corners in the back are perfect nooks for card playing and
other distractions
The jukebox is also one of the best in town (I've played many) and the burgers n' such are no frills but prompt
and soooo good
Great place for burgers and beer
Perfect after work hangout
Happy hour is only $2 for pints, so bring your thirst and a wad of cash
It's the worthy it!
White Horse Burgers are great and with the addition of a beer outside, it makes for a great afternoon
I love this place during football season
2 TVs at the bar and a decent selection of beers
Great place to dine alone
I suggest a burger or chicken cutlet sandwich (both are among the best in NYC) with a White Horse Ale at the bar watching the tube
Outside is great but it gets real crowded real early
avoid Friday nights if you aren't amused by Frat boys
Not your fancy bar/club but it does the trick if you are looking for a neighborhood bar
Good selection of beers, reasonable priced liquor and the service is decent
Bartenders are good and get to you pretty quick but the waitresses are hit and miss
Some days you get good service and other days you don't

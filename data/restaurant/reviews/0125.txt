I took my bf to this restaurant for his birthday dinner because I heard good reviews in Zagat, City Search and Epinions
To our dissapointment, the menu is very difficult to understand and the selection is not that great
The food tasted bland and too pricey consedering it did not come with any side dishes
I tried the smoked baccala and tortufo as suggested in the reviews I read
It tasted ok, but not out of this world
All in all, it's not worth it
I will definately not go there again
Since we ware seded at the front room next to the bar, i felt that for a couple to hold a conversation it was to noisy
I would come back and request a back room table rather then dine at the front
The prosciuto crudo is just like in italy
It's my favorite Italian second to Il Mulino, it's different though
I would recommend this place to everybody, new yorkers especially, cause if you live in NYC and don't know this place, there's something wrong with you! And tourists: Go, it's a true NYC experience, even though you feel like you're in Italy
Just thinking about it makes me hungry
I've been to this restaurant twice to be sure I wasn't there on an off night the first time
Both times the food I had was overspiced with one flavor that dominated
Both times the service was extremely amateurish
This place came highly recommended and was extremely disappointing
Atmosphere and impeccable service at this place; i was so excited b/c i had heard this was the premiere authentic roman osteria in new york
but while the food was great, it wasn't truly 'authentic roman'-- even though they use italian for the menu (kudos), the penne arrabiatta was far from authentic, and the pricey appetizers were not worth it
we tried 3 different desserts and loved them all (tartufo, grapefruit sorbet, panna cotta), but overall it was a better-than-mediocre and pretty pleasant experience
Who says serving slices of salumi on an itty bitty plate sans garnish counts for an appetizer? Don't even bother with the salted cod -- a soggy mess
The veal zuppeta was wayyy too salty (and I LOVE salt)
Have tasted better marinated pork shank down in Chinatown
Highlight: The gnocchi pasta was very good as all the pastas seem outstanding
But to be such a highly revered Zagat top 50 restaurant -- come on guys -- you can't serve junk that questions your culinary integrity
Overrated
If u must go, sit at the back of the restaurant where it's much nicer
Excellent fresh food
Excellent service
One of the most pleasurable dining experiences I've had
The food at Lupa is very good and is true to its Italian heritage, however, after waiting for hours on end your mind could be playing tricks on you
Go for lunch when it's not so crowded
I enjoyed everything about the restaurant
The food was excellent and the ambience was very pleasant
I would go back
Ate at Lupa Saturday
As usual pastas shined as did the striped bass special
Lamb chops and polpette however were oversalted (lamb especially) to the point of inedible
We let our waitress know this and she came back from the kitchen saying that the chef seasons the meat aggresively and if we don't like it, we should specify little or no salt when we place the order
Now, how one is supposed to know that he/she is about to get slammed with all this salt, I don't know
Maybe she meant in the future (provided we still want to dine there after this)
Moral of the story, if you order meat at Lupa always ask for little or no salt or you'll be sorry
Food couldnt be better, service and staff superb, ambience just terrific, and wine list right on target with the rich and flavorful foods
See Dana the bartender to recommend her fav wines and sit back and enjoy each fantastic bite! A must in NYC-great location, excellent food and if you have ever actually eaten in Italy-this place hits the spot! Antonio keep up the good work! Gracia Lupa! We will see ya soon! Ciao!!!
I recently took someone to Lupa for the first time
We were seated immediately and the service was great
Our food was wonderful
Everything is priced so well and that you can taste at least 2 appetizers and 2 main courses
The homemade tartufo is a winner
The wine list is full of reasonable good selections
Definitely recommend it
This was hands down the best dinner I've had in my life
The food was unmatched, the wine was excellent, and the undoubtable New York atmosphere gave this mid-westerner the real New York feel!
What a great dining experience
The food was outstanding, and very well priced for the quality and portion size
Service was excellent
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
I have been to Lupa twice, and each time I was a fantastic experience
The look and feel of the restaurant makes you feel like you are in Italy, the wait staff is friendly and helpful, the wine list is extensive and great for people who want to try something new! The food is delicious, and the apps are great for sharing
I have reccomended it to many friends and highly reccomend it for a first or second date!
The food here is fantastic! You can't beat it
The surroundings, the food, and the great staff make this place superb
I can't wait to dine here again
Tasty is all I can say!
LUPA restaurant is New Youk City has in my opinion the best chef around
His way of keeping food preparation simple, fast but elegant works just right for me
I highly recommend this fine entertaining establishment for anyone especially those they enjoy authentic regional italian dining
I've been to the restaurant twice
Each time I sat at the bar
The waiter/waitress in both occasions were very knowledgeable helpful
I particularly liked the grilled whole bass, it was delicious
The butterfly pork was tasty and had depth but not greasy
Selection of wine was also extensive
The only complaint I have is that Lupa doesn't have prix-fixe
I wouldn't recommend this joint to anyone so I can keep the gem all to myself
Last night was our first time at Lupa, and it was great
The service was helpful and unobtrusive, the wine list was good, and the food was really good
It's always really busy, so make a reservation
Some folks don't get this modest outpost of the Batali/Bastianich empire
First off, you have to buy into the fact that it's a New York spin on the neighborhood-oriented Roman Osteria
Next, you can best enjoy the menu when you share lots of stuff family style with a bunch of people (two couples minimum)
Lastly, ignore dinner and show up for lunch promptly at noon
Take a table in the bar area and be prepared for a satisfying and inexpensive meal
Order two antipasti (affetati piccolo and frutti di mare piccolo), two primi (bucatini all' Amatriciana plus ricotta gnocchi with fennel sausage ragu) and two secondi (saltimbocca and the plate of the day)
Your bill will be $82 plus tax/tip
Not bad
The cured meat plate is delicious if you like that sort of thing, which I do
Ate here twice - once at a table and once at the tiny bar facing the kitchen
Both meals were very good
The service was friendly and very competent - the waiter recommended a fantastic inexpensive wine
If you sit at the bar you'll get a good look at the charming chef and the hardworking playfulness of the kitchen staff
The ambience is warm East Village hipness
This place sucks
Seriously
We ordered 2 vegetables, one second, and a cheap bottle of wine, (really dinner for one, drinks for 2) at a cost of $91
Now, the price is not what makes this place suck, but it competes with the food for leaving a bad taste in your mouth
All analogies aside, Lupa is salt heavy to the point of turning out inedible food
The food, sans salt, would still not warrant a visit
The fact that anyone would ever eat here twice speaks to the curious popularity of everything lame in this world
Worst meal in NYC

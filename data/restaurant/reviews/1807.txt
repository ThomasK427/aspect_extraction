When I came back with my posse, the wait staff gets upset that we order too much and need another table
But hey, good eats like this needs to go overboard at times!
I heard it was quick but the service had no time to talk
They would quicly answer questions and move on and impatiently ask for your order
The food came fast
If you love noodles, this is the place
The soup was loaded with big, homemade noodles, the entries were huge and fresh and flavorful
Took home plently for another meal
Reasonably priced
Not a cozy atmosphere and definitly felt rushed but the food was worth the comprimise
I've been going to Sammy's for years, since i was in high school, while going to SVA and every time i go back to the city
I once rode a train for 3 hours one way to go to dinner at Sammy's, walk thorugh MOMA and get right back on the train
I was doing field research at Lakehurst Navy Base in NJ, we got rained out one day and i HAD to have thier cold sesame noodles and BBQ duck
The food here is simply great
One of the best Chinese joints in the city but relatively inexpensive
Service is pretty quick and attentive as well
Can accomodate lone diners and big groups as well!
I'm very picky about my Chinese food especially since I'm Chinese and my mom is a great cook, but this is one place I often go to for their Beef Stew Noodles
I've taken my dad there before and he always asks me if we can go there again when he visits me just for the beef noodles
Big bowl of stewed beef with just a bit of the tendon to keep it good and juicy
Other stuff there is pretty good too including chicken with eggplant
Decent value for decent chinese food for the area - obviously you can get cheaper down in chinatown
some of these reviews truly surprise me
you can get better, cheaper and more authentic chinese food a short ride away in chinatown
this place has nothing on any number of noodle shops down there
i went here twice - the first time because nothing else was open and this place looked good
all of us were disappointed
the second time, i must have forgotten how mediocre the food was
what a mistake
the roast pork was on par with the worst of the take-out places in suburban new jersey, and the broth had no flavor and on top of that the dumplings tasted like the frozen ones in the supermarket
but then i should have paid more attention to the fact that no chinese people were actually eating in this place when i walked in
do yourself a favor and go to chinatown for some real chinese food
The no frills decor is actually an asset at this amazingly tasty restaurant, because it keeps all of the trendy posers away
Every dish here is excellent, cheap, and gigantic
Highly recommend any dish with the words pork, bun, noodle, or dumpling any where near the title
The fried rice with chinese sausage is another stand out
This is also a fabulous place to seat 15 people on the drop of a hat
Service is functional -- they keep the water glasses full
Hands down thee best in cheap eats
Don't expect to ask for a course break, they seat you, you order, the food comes flying out, you eat
once finished the check comes with fortune cookies
BOOM, you're out in a half hour
Anything on the menu I'd recommend and a couple could eat for around $20
you should share and entree the portions are tremendous
The roast pork bun at 1
95 is almost a meal in itself
Fresh baked dough filled with gobs of sweet roast pork
awesome
Noodle soups at $5
95/6
95 are enough to eat for a meal and then take home for leftovers
Delivery within the area shows up within 10-20 minutes
If you're into roast meats you have to try this place
Especially the roast pork which is incredibly sweet and tasty
Same for the ribs
Not a place to take a first date ;)
Seems like the food gets to your table right after you order it! Big plates of steaming hot, good quality Chinese everytime
Food isn't that spicy but the prices are cheap and the restaurant is bustling and fun
A terrific authentic Italian restaurant with scrumptious homemade bread and pastas and more
We were a large group and all ordered different things and everyone was extremely pleased
don't hesitate to go!
I had my bday party dinner here last wknd with 13 friends and was very impressed with the overall experience
The space is small but gives you a nice, warm vibe
The staff is friendly and they did a nice job ensuring that all 13 orders came out at the same time! The food was excellent and the bread was too
I would highly recommend this place to anyone
I've been here many times, and the food is consistently delicious, especially the veal with artichokes
Not to mention the service is top notch, your glass is never empty for more than a second
I think it's pretty much a family run business because I've seen the same 5 people working there for several years
They take pride in their service
As for the atmosphere, I agree with other reviewers, it can be good for either a romantic date or a night out with friends
Try it, you won't be disappointed
We were basically ignored
They had yummy bread we had to ask 3x for more
We had to ask 3x for water
We had to ask 3x for anything we needed
And the waiter barely understood basic English
The food was good, not overwhelmingly great
We think an investor in or owner of the restaurant must have been sitting behind us in the restaurant with his date because the couple behind us were doted on, while my party of 4 was treated like dirt
Bad vibe all together
Wouldn't go back
When my fiancee and I look for a place in the city, Chelsea Ristorante is always on our list
The atmosphere is great, service is second to none, and the food is spectacular
I would recommend Chelsea Ristorante to anyone
The wine list isn't really special (and is overpriced) but you can find a few wines that are pretty good value
There are a lot of different pasta dishes to choose from, but nothing oustanding
The desserts on the other hand are first-rate, and the tiramisu is delicious
It's a good neighborhood restaurant
I live in the neighborhood and go to Chelsea Ristorante at least once a week
The food is consistently good and with super large portions
I would recommend it to anyone
My boyfriend and I loved this place
Romantic atmosphere, great food, attentive wait staff, and they finished off the evening with a complimentary plate of shortbread cookies and fresh strawberries
Also, if you like the flavor of smoked salmon, the Tagliolini Nero is a great pasta dish
I visited the Chelsea Ristorante for the first time the other night
The food was delicious and the service was excellent
The ambience, though romantic, was overpowered by several people in the bar area and a birthday party celebration that made the dining area feel crowded
I did appreciate the decorative, low-lit style the restaurant displayed
I will return to try another entree since the food was absolutely delicious
But next time I will make sure it isn't as crowded in the bar area
This restaurant is wonderful

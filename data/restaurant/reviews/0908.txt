I colored my placemat, ate a good meal and enjoyed the atmosphere!
Avoid at all costs any of the tofu items on the menu
The tofu reuben is a white pile of mush
If you're vegetarian, stick with the grilled cheese and french fries
Can't go wrong there! One day when it was really crowded someone working there was handing out PBR's in a can to those waiting for a table
And for pete's sake, leave the strollers at home! It's too small for strollers!
Schnack is the best hot dog place I've ever been to
The food is great (try their special Schnackie sauce) and they actually come up with some new twists on the old hot dog concept
The atmosphere is like in a nice old-fashioned diner and they actually have a real record player including great old records
All in all, a very comfortable, homey place
Plus, they serve coke in glass bottles!
Went to eat there last night and was very pleased
This is a bare bones hotdog and beer joint but the food is high quality, the prices cheap, and the service was great
I work in restaurants and can be picky but i was very happy with everything
A great addition to the neighborhood
I ate here based on advice of friends from Japan and I agree with them, this is the best Japanese Sushi Restaurant in New York City
Sushi Chef Mr
Hideo Kuribara has won the top sushi award in New York City and Washington, D
C
for the past several years
The sushi is gourmet and even has items I have seen no where else
Most of the super fresh fish is flown in from Japan
The food just melts in your mouth
Nothing in NYC even comes close
It is enjoyable sitting at the sushi bar having omikase or the tasting menu
The prices are a true bargain if you consider that the quality is the best in all of New York City
The atmosphere is quiet, relaxing and understated
The service is super polite and accommodating
This sushi restaurant is the real thing and would rank excellently even in Japan
It was my birthday and I had made a reservation for my party of 10 a month prior to the dinner
From the moment we arrived, it was a horrible experience
They were short on menus so we had to wait 15 minutes to see it! Then, we didn't get our appetizers for almost an hour! Then, we didn't get dinner until almost 2 HOURS later! This ruined my entire birthday night that was planned
Our reservations were for 8pm, and we didn't leave the restaurant until 11:15pm- which forced us to cancel our 10pm dessert reservation at another place
The food was h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e, and I actually had to send my dinner back because it tasted so bad
Not to mention, it was all overpriced! To top it all off, they added a 20% gratuity to our bill, which was NOT deserved! The manager came out and gave us a round of drinks on the house since we had to wait so long, but none of us were impressed with the gesture
bottom line, stay far away from this nightmare of a restaurant!
What better way to end Memorial Day weekend but with a memorable Italian meal at this fine and exquisite restaurant in the heart of Little Italy downtown Manhattan
I was there with my 14 year old son and we had a most enjoyable dinner
The Osso Bucco melted in my mouth reminding me of my grandmother's cooking and the risotto was even better
Wowwwwwwwww
That's all I can say but can't wait till my next visit there
A must experience for anyone who apreciates wholesome and great Italian food
ps: The portions were incredible as well
The location seems to draw a number of out-of-towners who are looking for a change from the typical red sauce experience in Little Italy
The food is not too bad (although this was the first time I've encountered deep-fried Veal Saltimbocca!) but the wine prices are OUTRAGEOUS!! Mark-ups of 500% are not hard to find
Service grinds to a halt once they get busy and the kitchen can be overwhelmed
When the bill finally arrived, I noticed a 20% service charge was added -- even though we were a party of just 2
Perhaps visitors from Europe are used to seeing service charges and pay the full amount without question
We didn't
The waiter acted like the charge was done by the computer and he couldn't quite explain it
Well, when I told him there's no way we're paying it, the service charge disappeared! Stay away from this place
I have been here multiple times for various occasions and I have to say it is consistantly good
I have come with friends and they are hooked afterwards
The food is great, the waiters are always friendly, and I have never felt rushed
I recently dined at a very nice outdoor table at Park East Grill
The planters and beauiful floating candles on each outfoor table were the perfect touch
The strawberry mojito was one of best and most creative cocktails I ever had
The Chickpea pancakes appetizer was delicous and had one of the nicest plate presentations I have EVER seen
My 22oz rib steak was cooked to a perfect Medium Rare (as i had requested) and the meat was so juicy and tender
My Fondue dessert was delicous and the perfect end to a great meal
I highly recommend !!
I had the best steak of my life at the Park East Grill
It was the 14oz fillet, and it was so lean, juicy, and flavorful
I inquired as to how it was so delicus and was told that all the meat used is prime grade meat and is aged as well
The desserts were amazing as well
I ended up here at a dinner party for a friends birthday and was shocked that i had never heard of it
The atmoshphere was great and the food was even better
The menu offered such a great mix of dishes that i had trouble choosing, but I was VERY happy with the duck breast I had for my entree', and i also ate some of my friend's veal chop (amazing)
To top it off, the good looking staff offers great service
I will be back soon !!
I recently visted Park East Grill and was most impressed
They told me they only opened a couple of weeks ago and i was shocked
The service was excellent and the decor was absolutely stunning, it looked like something you'd find down in SoHo
I had the Park East Fillet wich was incredibly succulent and oozing with flavour
I honestly think it was the best meat i've ever had! For dessert i had the the mouth watering pear, almond and fig struddle which was accompanied with vanilla bean ice cream and a a brown sugar brandy sauce
The taste was to die for!   Overal i had a truly scruptous meal and have definate plans to return to Park East grill in the very near future
A dinning must!!
It's such a shame when you find a neighborhood restaurant that serves decent food but the staff and service is so utterly disappointing and neglectful that you never want to go back
If you live in the area, my recommendation would be to order from home so you don't have to interact with the vacant staff
But it should not be
The news is out that this restaurant is everything a neighborhood could want
In the 2 1/2 years that they are open, every meal that I have ever had was just perfect
Whether it was a simple family style dinner to an elaborate gourmet meal, the food was perfect
I have been there through many changes of menu style, room arrangements, staff changes, but the one thing that has always held true, was the quality of the food, the caring and very accommodating staff
The owner and proprietor is on premises, warmly greeting and always concerned about our dining experience
This restaurant is striving for excellence and they achieve it everytime
We live in the neighborhood and frequent Palmira's
In the dozen plus times I've been, I have no complaints
The food, the service, the ambiance is consistantly great! I do have to say in terms of dining as a large group, every time we go it is simply as a couple, not with lots of people, although I am ready to host a little something there
I've been to Palmira's many times, and have always found the food to be consistently fresh, very creative, beautifully presented and delicious -- and moderately priced
The owners are very accomodating and ready to please
They will even prepare dishes which are requested but not on the menu! It's also a really great place for a party
All in all, it is a great addition to the Brooklyn restaurant scene, and one which definitely should be tried
I've brought many people there, and we've all enjoyed it
Palmira's recently changed the menu and it's a major improvement
The prices are more reasonable and the choices expanded
My wife love's the Veal Marsala and their meat sauce
I'm a huge fan of the Penne Bambina
The salads, bread, and draft beer are always fresh
I'm surprised that this place hasn't taken off

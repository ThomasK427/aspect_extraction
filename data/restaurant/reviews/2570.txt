It was New Years Eve and the place WAS NOT packed at all, so she doesn't even have that excuse
It took forever for her to take drink orders, get menus, and the arrival of the food took almost a year
I spoke to her at the bar during dinner (cig break) and she was really sweet
But this is not the career for her
We found Film Center Cafe on Citysearch after looking for a restaurant in the neighborhood, it's such a col place with great food and nice people
We'll definately make it one of our new places to go
It seems like a hit or miss place worth trying different items to know what is fantastic and what to definitely avoid
The wraps here are simple but SO delicious, the fries are addictive and potentially wonderful as long as you don't have the food delivered (when finally delivered (after 45min
, the fries were horrible, hard - you could break a tooth) Also, the guacamole is fantastic but the chips taste like they were a week old
Such potential
In person is the way to go with this restaurant and worth the return for the good items!
Decent food at very cheap prices! Our waitress was on the ball and patient
Good plae to meet up with a friend
I recommend the Salmon Wrap
and for saturday and sunday brunch? all-you-can-drink champagne/mimosa for a mere $9
95
food included!
This restaurant offers good quality food at a very reasonable price
The salads, appitizers lunch menu are particularly good
Many performing artists congregate here for drinks a rest stop after the day's auditions, rehearsals long hours on the set!
The first feeling I got walking in here was that it was desperate to be a hipster hangout
But when there's not a lot of people here, the decor makes is look closer to a Planet Hollywood than a hangout
The bartenders are more adept than the kitchen staff--the menu has too many cuisines on it and the results aren't pretty
Plus, there are either too many TVs in here or not enough (they're distracting but not eye candy), but the clumsy design makes it hard to tell
My husband and I went to Meson Sevilla on a Saturday night after 8pm
No problem getting seated and the service was prompt and attentive
We had 3 tapas dishes--Chorizo in red wine, langostinos and empanadas
All were fantastic! With 2 glasses of wine and flan for desert, the bill was just over $50
00
You can spend more than that on a few drinks elsewhere
A great value and very convenient location
I have made Meson Sevilla a regular spot on my dining list in New York
From their friendly knowledgeable staff to the, terrific pre-theatre specials, this is a great destination for those looking for a special night out, or just some great eats
They have a seperate downstairs area that is perfect for groups with a pretty good group menu to boot
Some of my friends perfer to order several tapas and share, while i like the pre-fixe dinners
Either way a great value, and a paella second to none in Manhattan
I have a Spaniard background and live in NYC and I have to say that that restaurant on 46th between 8th and 9th Ave
has the most authentic tapas menu I've ever seen in USA
Traditional but at the same time exotic and excellently set up, that restaurant makes you feel you are enjoying not only the great Spaniard food, but also the beautiful envairoment of Spain
This restaurant row Spanish spot has everything one might expect on the menu
An extensive tapas list, sangria, paella, the works
They even have an Italian menu which, being of Italian heritage, I avoided
The hostess was extremely pleasant, grabbing us from our stroll to find a place for dinner insisting we come in
The staff were nice and the service fast enough to keep me from getting antsy
However, the food was just okay
The garlic shrimp was served still sizzling, they should have let it sit and cool off before serving
Bland and not garlicy enough for my taste but the shrimps were plump
The paella was not very flavorful and the rice seemed undercooked
Do not go with a large group, the seating was a bit cramped
Luckily, it was lite on the wallet and the kind staff made up for the food's short comings
Try it
The food was revolting
The octopus was slimy, not firm
Everything was in sauces that covered up any flavors in the food
The shrimp were dry, mealy, and flavorless
And the waitstaff were inelegant
I actually went here because of the reviews here, so I thought I owed it the site to write in
Major disappointment in many ways
Keep looking
When we arrived at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday, the place was lively (maybe even a little noisy), but by 8:00 we nearly had the restaurant to ourselves
We asked the waiter which tapas were the spiciest and he replied that they could make any of them spicy
They did - - 2 of us shared the chorizo in red wine and marinated pork cubes (both wonderful) as well as the grilled calamari and a tri-color salad
If I were to go there again, I would only order 2 dishes at a time as they all tasted best when hot and fresh
The bread was dissapointing, but there was lots of it and there was also a reasonable Rioja wine by the glass
From the host, to the waiter, to the bus boy, every staff person was delightful
The food was amazing and plenty
I ordered the Shrimp Plancha and they were one of the tastiest meals I have ever had, and I eat out a lot
Desserts were extraordinary especially the Flan and Tartufo, the portions were so big my friend and I shared
You definitely get your money's worth
For $22 per person I got Bruschetta and unlimited bread before my meal, followed by an appetizer, entree, dessert and coffee or tea
If you want to have an incredible meal and a great experience go to Meson Sevilla, you will not be disappointed
try their sangria and a good mix of spanish and italian cuisine, nice place
Meson Sevilla is the best restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of dining in
They welcomed me and my boyfriend with the attention every couple would love to get from a restaurant
It was lively, yet intimate at the same time
We were even seranaded by one of the help; his beautiful voice made this anniversary dinner memorable
Plus, the food was outrageous! Try their sangrias! I hope everyone else enjoys their experience there as much as I did
The host outside drew us in, and we loved the immense menu of both Spanish and Italian cuisine
Prix fixe great deal
Two women leaving gave us their mostly full pitcher of sangria, friendly crowd of both guest and staff
Reliable Restaurant Row choice
I was at Meson Sevilla restaurant with a group of friends and we all thought it was a great restaurant
The staff is verry good ,the food was excelent,the price was good and the owners are verry warm and polite
I frequent in the restaurant row, but this restaurant shines due to the added cuisine option (Spanish as well as Italian) and friendly service for the neighborhood
This block is filled with prix-fixe places
I recommend Meson Sevilla, since the food is good and it has more leg room than a few other neighboring restaurants
Great food, decor is new and fresh,parking across the street,service was great and polite
Meson Sevilla has been taken over by new owners who know what they are doing the place has a fresh look and the food is 100x better than the past owners,great restaurant,looking foward to dine at Sevilla soon
My entire family went to dinner there after a matinee
We were a large group and were sat immediately
The Food was great: a bunch of appetizers and nine dinners, and not one complaint
The wine selection was huge and had a number of reasonably priced bottles
The service was good, the waiter was attentive without being overbearing
However, our dinner was early and by the time we left the place was very crowded (they didn't rush us at all!!), so if you are going with a big group I wouldn't recommend peak hours since it's small
Overall it was a great experience, good enough in fact that we are planning to go back the next time we get together for a show and dinner!
I've been going to Cara Mia since they first opened and I never get tired of it
I've referred local friends, friends visiting from out-of-town and strangers (I'm a tour guide)to it and they've never been disappointed
The specials are fabulous! The wine selection is great! The waitstaff are attentive, but not intrusive and responsive to my bread addiction
I took my nephew there for his birthday when he was about 8 and my sister told me he later referred to the dessert as Mom, it was so good, I'd cut off my arm for a piece of that cake
It is the absolute best deal for wonderful Italian food without going broke

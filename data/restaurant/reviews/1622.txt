Good staff
Superficial and noisy place
I went to Indochine with family and friends, and had a wonderful time
Beforehand I checked out the other reviews and did not find any of the cons to be the case during my visit
The waitstaff was more than competent and friendly to boot
I liked the decor, and thought the palm fronds were fun and inviting
It wasn't stuffy at all, and the food tasted delicious
A+ for presentation
I would definitely recommend it - especially for that price!
The staff here is wonderful, really nice, don't know what the other reviews were talking about
The food was great, was sitting next to a huge designer
what more can i say
I have heard that young models work at that place as waitresses
It seems to be true
They are young and skinny, basically Kate Moss looking
Food was good, but I think that there are better places to dine in NY
Indochine was o-kay
The hostess was very rude from the beginning after she realized that she had taken the wrong time for my reservation
The service was unfriendly and we were pressured to leave at a certain time
The food was fine but since the service was terrible, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone
I wouldn't go back there myself
fresh, delicious, unusual food in an elegant atmosphere
Oh and the coffee and desserts are wonderful!! Really really nice, would definitely go again
We were seated relatively promptly and enjoyed the food, drinks, and atmosphere, but before we had even finished eating, staff were coming to the table, trying to clear our plates and asking us if we would leave within 30 minutes
We had only been at the restaurant for 1 hour
Our plates were taken before we finished eating and our waitress sent the hostess to tell us we had to leave to make room for the next table and that we had to pay before we left
This was extremely unprofessional and highly insulting
To insinuate patrons would leave without paying before the check was even delivered was extremely rude
This is a great restaurant wasted by rude, unprofessional staff
If we ever eat there again we will make areservations based upon the stipulation that we will not be rushed out and insulted just because they overbooked the restaurant
Granted, it's not in the broadway theatre district but it is opposite the Public Theatre! Indochine is a very convenient, very chic, very good pre-theatre place
The service was pleasant, the ambience comfortable and the food very good!! Spring rolls were extremely tasty and the duck and the spicy chicken breast were outstanding!!
Food was bland - eg
a pho soup that honestly was tasteless
The place is also deafeningly noisy, so much so that it was hard to hold a conversation
However, the service was great - responsive, friendly, quick
Our server spilled a drink on the table cloth and it was cleaned up in an instant, no mess, free drinks to compensate, and left us impressed at how seamlessly this was fixed
Food is overpriced for the quality you get
If they could fix that, it would be good
Having chosen to take some distinguished guests to dinner at Indochine came as a result of so many positive reviews
Our reservation was for 9, didn't get seated until 9:20 with no acknowledgment by the staff of the delay
Once at the table our waitress managed on two occasions to take 15 minutes bringing drinks to our table, our plates sat uncleared on the table for just as long
Fortunately for Indochine, the food is excellent and the ambience energetic and beautiful
Get rid of the models and do yourself well by employing 'real' waitstaff
Oh, and skip the mojito you'll find much better elsewhere
I was not expecting this place to be much to be honest
I was wrong
Great cocktails and very good food
Not a huge fan of the palm leaves painted on the wall, but overall nice decor
VERY pleasant hostess and wait staff
I was there for a birthday party and it was a great time
Not painfully expensive either
The Cottage Chinese Retaurant is on its way to becoming a neighborhood institution
It's been in the Gramercy area for over ten years
Moderate prices, good food, comfortable seating, nice atmosphere
Only a lack of the nth degree of refinement keeps it from a higher rating
Poor The Szechuan Dumplings were like overcooked pasta mush! The Diced Chicken with Peanuts was all peanuts and about 4small I mean tiny pieces of chicken
The only thing good was the flavor
When commenting to the staff I was told That's the way the Dish is cooked ( I think there should be at least 50% of Chicken in a Chicken dish when it comes with peanuts) Would not recommend
Recently, I dined with my 18mo
niece early in the evening and was appauled by the service
Not only was the wait staff annoyed by her presence but before we were served one of the waiters wrestled a spoon from the child and snatched up all of our dishes! The child was not behaving in any way atypical of her age and certainly was not throwing anything
The waiter refused to stop at our table during the meal and the check was delivered before we had finished
I commented that the service was less than satisfactory and the waiter replied M'am, it is no wonder that a child as awful as this belongs to a person like you
!! Not only was I completely shocked but the other patrons in our vicinity commented on how offended they were
I told management that I was disappointed and would never return
This restaurant is a great place for a quick bite before a show down in the village
It is extremely inexpensive, and the food is great
I have not seen better service in a long time going out into the city
In Short A cheery blue-and-yellow exterior beckons passersby into this fun and funky bistro named for the emblem of Thailand
The spacious dining room's leopard prints, gold walls and disco balls attract a trendy East Village crowd
The menu showcases Thai-French favorites: fresh chopped hai (white fish) and salmon with Chinese black olives and basil oil; mussels in coconut-lemon grass broth; and garlicky octopus sauteed with ground pork, broccoli rabe and lime juice
Cinnamon-roasted chicken and Thai-spiced frites are signatures
OK french attitude is ok when the food is good
But when the food is not all that good you walk out feeling, ok these people are rude and i have to make a pit stop at duane reade for pepto to find some way to prevent hurling this stuff out
We were meeting some friends(a group of 5) when my wife and me got there earlier
We were asked to be seated at the very tiny 8 seater bar till the entire party arrived while the restaurant only had 2 tables occupied
Being in the restaurant business myself I understood the reasoning for it (Tao does it too)
However we had a third friend arrive with no place to sit
Asked if we could get a table now, the server seemed totally not interested in seating us and had to check with the owner/manager (who I gather now must be a control freak)
Anyway we get a table and order some appetizers from one of the waitresses who was pleasently nice
However when the party was complete we had the other waitress come over who said that we had to order all the food at once and couldnt order just appetizers
As bizzare as it may seem to most of us who go out very often to eat, this is the first time I heard something like this
Anyway the company was good so I figured we make the most of it
The shrimp dumplings were awesome, crab cakes terrible, tom yum soup good
Our main course arrives and I was suprised to see the beef salad very dry and cold
Although it was a salad it was supposed to be grilled
Oh not to forget, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria $26 or $28 it was these horrifying when she came over with a small mini 16 oz pitcher
Anyway we were rushed towards the end of the meal as they had people waiting and conversation and interaction with the patrons (especially if they were new or unfamiliar to the staff) was at a minimum
We gave a 15% gratuity but believe me I am never going to reccommed this to a good friend
Don't let the impressive cool website mislead you
A message for the chef/owner/ manager: Read all these comments posted here and start working on the weak points, its not too late
I understand you are located in a very casual somewhat bohemian part of town however the attitude is completely 5th ave
Went here with my wife for our 9th anniversary
The waitress didn't seem to know anything about the menu, she forgot our drinks, took away our wine list after I asked to keep it, and then said, I'm sorry, I only slept 3 hours last night
I work at a restaurant in Soho and if I said that to a table I would be fired
The food was good, but it was extremely rushed
The waitress was VERY aware that we were displeased but never sent a manager over to try to calm us down or make things better
She offered my wife a free glass of wine, which was just too little too late
It was really lousy wine too

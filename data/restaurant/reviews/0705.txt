some non-greeks
pleasant
it makes it worth while to travel downtown just for the appetizers
i only ordered appetizers and they were all great
my favorite was between the stuffed calamari and octapus
the service, music people watching were all terrific
definately worth the trip
I am an American living in Athens and travelled to New York especially for the opening of Thalassa
I represent the designer of the restaurant, in Greece, and was floored by the sheer beauty of the decor!!! Well Done Jean Pierre HEIM!!!!   Beautiful is beyond words!!! You really got the ambience of Greece - without it looking like a Greek restaurant! The sailing boat concept is exceptional! Jean Pierre, you have outdone yourself YET again!  The Makri family, who own the restaurant, are a lovely family and are wonderful hosts! Full of Cephalonian hospitality!!! Best of luck to you all!  The chef, Gregory Zapantis, is a star!!! After living in Greece for 17 years, I know what REAL Greek food tastes like - this is really the BEST Greek food I have ever had outside of Greece!   Well done to all involved with making Thalassa a success!
They forgot about us after we checked in and then our dinners were delayed for a long time for no apparent reason
Fortunately, the food was terrific - I would recommend it just for that
Straight from the Greek Gods themselves- absolutely DIVINE! Thalassa, in a class of its own
This place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding
Fine dining at its best, and for the wine lovers: a splendid collection on the lower level is a must see!
Thalassa is highly recommended
Leaves and amazing impression and definitely not what I expected when I heard that you can pick your own fish from the bar
Thalassa is my new favorite greek restaurant in NYC - the calamari stuffed with feta was delicious
the seafood is so fresh and deliciously prepared
the baklava was a little dry, but aside from that, the food was superb
I am definitely going back soon!
Gourmet, Romantic, Friendly dining are the characteristics of this restaurant
The total feeling you get is if you were in Greece
There is an incredible selection of fresh fish
The staff described the fresh fish in detail
The side order of broccoli rabe with the finest feta I ever tasted
I found out that not only is the Chef also an owner but he is also partnered with a family that is in the Greek food business for a very long time
I will definately be a regular there
I had the pleasure of dinning at Thalassa Restaurant last Saturday night and I must say I was amazed
The space is spectacular and reminiscent of the simple splendor that exclusive restaurants in Mykonos can only offer
The place was so romantic and the deep music of Protopsalti, a wonderful Greek singer, echoed through the restaurant
I was actually pretty impressed with the prompt service because it was such a busy night
The fish was grilled to perfection and braised with ladolemono (a lemon and Olive oil mix)
I must say I have been at the mercy of Chef Gregory Zapanti for years
his menu is always mouthwatering and delicious
This is truly a great place
from the decor to the food to the outstanding wine list
I definately recommend it!
ohh and the downstairs was just so beautiful for a private party
There's even a cheese cave! You must check this place out
After eating in Greece over the summer my wife and I could not find a restaurant to satisfy us until we visited Thallasa
I heard a review the other nite on 880 - Bob Lape said very nice things regarding every aspect of this rest
My wife and I went the next nite and it's true - Thalassa is simply the best in Greek - seafood dining
the fresh fish as you walk in are waiting to be selected
The staff even though the majority are not greek where very well trained in this cuisine
the selection of greek wines and cheeses - i have only seen in Greece at a couple of the finest rest
Even the decor building are screanibg Greece I can't wait to take my Greek friends
The most incredible, freshest fish around
As a seafood eater what better place to dine
As soon as I walked in I thought I just arrived in Santorini and greeted by a beautiful women The huge variety of fish displayed is Great- they actually encouraged me to select my own fish-so I did- that was fun
The staff is extremely professional and knowledgeable as expected
The menu was an extensive wide range of unique dishes
Very good looking crowd
As for Ambience, the lighting, curtains, back lit onyx and marble work throughout the entire 2 floors is impeccable
I will definately be returning very soon
Great selection of rare wines
Romanitic tables downstairs
No wonder its named after the Sea
I live in the Tribeca so when Thalsa opened I was eager to give it a try
It did not disappoint
The space itself is gorgeous
Theyve done a great job creating a stylish and spacious environment to enjoy great food
I came with my entire family since my Mother is Greek and we had a marvelous and festive meal
We learned a family that also lives in the neighborhood owns the restaurant and you can tell by all the little details
Thus, the next time my family gets together for a special occasion, its very likely well be tucking in at Thalasa
This weekend I visisted this new greek seafood restaurant and it was great! It has been the best I've had in a long time
all complements to chef Gregory Zapanti
Keep it up! I recommend the stuffed calamari and anthos for appetizers; for the main course, try the lobster yvetsi or the pilafe
This trendy seafood place will definately become a regular spot for me
(It is also a very nice space for private parties!)
The seafood in the restaurant is unbeatable
My background is greek so im very picky with my food and the last best seafood restaurant I dined at was Trata (on 2nd ave
between 70th and 71st), but as good as Trata is no one can match the quality of Thallassa
I give a 10 to the Chef and his crew
Had dinner here on Friday night and was completely amazed
Since I live in the neighborhood, I thought I would try out the restaurant, though did not have high expectations
The menu is mostly seafood, fresh fish - by the pound
I had the Stuffed Grilled Calamari as an appetizer -- EXCELLENT!!! We were too stuffed for dessert, but the waiter came over and said the chef wanted us to try some dessert, so he gave us a small dish to sample - very good
I will definitely be making this a regular in my favorite places to eat out
THALASSA is a new trendy and classy seafood restaurant located in the heart of Tribeca! This new place is amazing starting from the decor, to the food, service, and environment
The decor consists of all white colors with blue spotlights giving it a relaxed look and a feel of the ocean
The fish is very fresh, the service is great, and altogetehr the place is incredibly done!
I was overwhelmed by the fine fare and the attentive service matching the best in the city
located in the heart of Tribecca
Newly opened,
Don't be suprised to see many a celebrity eating there almost every night
I am making bets that will be hearing alot about this restaurant
the new greek restaurant is such a great addition to an already powerful food block in the city
Do somebody leave their boat docked in tribeca
the food, service and decor are great
I am glad there is still a chance to get in certainly a neighborhood secret until now
The Scene Smooth adobe walls, spruce-latticed ceilings and flickering candles help create the stylishly relaxed vibe
Sit by the tall front windows watching West Village strollers, or settle into the warm, spacious back dining room
An informed, unobtrusively friendly staff takes care of newcomers and the slew of Agave addicts alike
The Food The menu offers fresh, intricately flavored twists on Southwestern fare, in generous portions
Standout appetizers include red snapper seviche, lamb and manchego taquitos and perfect guacamole
Cumin croutons, spiced pecans and jicama enhance the hearty salads
Quesadillas and tacos are kicked up a notch with barbecued-duck picadillo or Maine lobster fillings, accented by mango pico or sweet plantains
Well-prepared skirt steak and Angus short ribs with a delicate mole are entree favorites
Save room for Mexican vanilla creme brulee or cider-glazed, pecan-stuffed apples with ice cream--then come back for one of the best brunches in town
Dont usually do the citysearch thing

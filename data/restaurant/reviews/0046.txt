I've never ordered anything else from their menu
there's no need to
It's simply the best meal in NYC
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill
Their food were not impressive, especially their sword fish
It was their special for today, and they sure did suprise me
I felt like I was eating burnt fish, rather than a nice, fine cooked piece of fish
Also, their sake and their sparkle water were way too expensive
Just the drinks together cost over $100
Wouldn't go back ever again
East and pay at your own risk
The food at this place is average with an above average price tag
I felt like I had fallen into a tourist trap
We tried the duck quesadilla (good), a house special maki roll (nothing special), salmon 3 ways (dry+overcooked), and jumbo prawns (super salty)
I never mind paying for a good experience but this did not measure up
Our last experience was so disappointing
Had a terrible time making a reservation and when we arrived they still had the table count wrong, and that was after 5 phone calls! We waited at least 45 minutes to be served our entrees
When we received our bill, we were charged 3 desserts never ordered
It waill probably be the last time we go there
The place is busy but there's no excuse for taking 10 minutes to get our menus after we sat down
We also had to wait another 45 min to get our entree AFTER we finished our appetizers
The most attention we got was when the waiter was waiting to be paid
redeye grill is a fairly large restaurant
it isn't very intimate and the decor is pretty plain
the food was average
filet mignon was ordered medium but was dry and a little over cooked
mashed potatoes with scallions was tasteless
stuffed shrimp sounded delicous; arrived and was disappointed with it's mediocrity
desserts were a bit better, the chocolate mousse was very good
although our waiter mistook the cheesecake with a slightly brulee top as creme brulee
my glass of shiraz had a bit of cork in it
not sure if i would go again, it's got a great location on 56th street perfect for midtown workers
My friends and I truly enjoyed ourselves!! Nice atmosphere and crowd
Dinner was delicious
Perfect filet mignon - cooked just right! Good service
No rush, no attitude
Highly recommed!
We went to the Sunday brunch, and were pleasantly surprised to find a jazz combo there
The restaurant is a little loud, but we were able to converse well enough
The service is excellent -- the staff is attentive and the waitress was well-informed about the menu
My striped bass with grilled vegetables was excellently prepared (but could have been a smidge warmer)
The prices are a little steep, but it's a nice treat once in a while
The open sushi/fish ice display is amazing when you first walk in
The pop rock shrimp appetizer was just a plate of plain old fried shrimp
It was very loud, I felt too crowded, the man chair's next to me made it impossible for the waiters to pass
I also felt our waitress rushed us a little
I enjoyed everything at the redeye except for my entree itself
The apple martinis were large, tastey and strong
The lentil soup was amazing, as was the caesar salad
However, my steak was average at best
I didn't think it was possible to have a dry ribeye steak
My meal here was awesome, the appetizers, the bar finger food, the service, the drinks, the entrees of Smoked fish, Lamb salad, Clay pot salmon, Lobster rolls, and the dining room is spectacular
But the Banana Cream Pie was sensational, luckily my daughters couldn't finish theirs, so I got to have seconds
Thank you Redeye Grill for a great time!
The Red Snapper in Clay Pot is outatanding, as is the Bar
I always try to be there when Les is pouring the drinks
The Jazz is excellent
some of the best local talent in the City
To me this is the place to relax, unwind and enjoy life
The Scene Although the Upper East Side isn't usually known for its bargains, this is one
Neighborhood denizens may think they can keep this excellent and inexpensive eatery to themselves, but the secret is out and it's spreading
The eclectic crowd includes harried mothers too tired to cook for their children, businessmen looking for a quick meal, and older couples eager for a night out, all wanting the same thing: delicious food in a low-key atmosphere
The Food While there are plenty of meat dishes, including the sweet and spicy Curry Ga with humongous slices of chicken mixed with eggplant, onions and coconut milk, and Bo Sate with sauteed beef, pineapple and crushed peanuts, seafood and vegetarian dishes make up most of the menu
The curried okra is crunchy and the vegetarian basket boasts a cornucopia of stir-fried greens served up in an edible pasta basket
Be sure to taste the incredible assortment of vegetable and seafood spring and summer rolls
My Vietnamese friends introduced me to this place and said it was just like mom used to make
For $5 you can get a huge bowl of pho or bun and a pot of tea
It's enough to feed two people
The food is always tasty, filling, plentiful, and cheap! The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain
One of the best bets on the UES
Their take out service is really fast, prices are very reasonable and the food is great
Not to mention that portions are huge
This is not a place for a romantic dinner or to celebrate any sort of special occasion, but a great, reliable option for everyday dining
well i had read the reviews about this restaurant on citysearch, so my husband and I decided to give it a try
my husband and i both had bad past experiences with vietnamese food, so we were definatley hesitant
well to our delight the food was very good
the waiter was helpful in picking out some dishes we might like, the food had a thai edge to it as well, which was refreshing
the quantity of food was a good size with tons of shrimp in our noodle dish
our meal was under 30 bucks
so we definately came out of there feeling like a winner
i recommend this place for sure
the title say it all, your on a budget and want some really descent food thats the place to go, for two: 1 appetizer (share), 2 entrees, there you go total check around $25 and you will have some left over for tomorrow's lunch!
I LOVE Saigon Grill
I've been there at least a dozen times
The pork chops, cubed steak, pho bo and whole fried fish are among my favorites
The ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample
The service is always fast and so is the take out
It's a neighborhood fave so you might find yourself waiting 5-10 minutes for a table but generally no longer
best value for great food in this neighborhood
Delivery is incredibly fast as well
I love this place
The food is always great and the delivery is so fast
No sooner have you put the phone down when you have hot delicious food at your door
Eating in the restaurant is great also
The waitors are always helpful and the wait is never bad if there is one at all
I order from Saigon Grill all the time
The food is great, it get's to my apt very quickly, and is inexpensive
I have eaten there many times, the service is always very fast
I love the shrimp summer role, chicken kabob's, and all the chicken and shrimp dishes
Saigon Grill is great!

Run, do not walk! Make reservations
I came to Union Square Cafe for a co-workers birthday luncheon and was extremely impressed
The high ceilings and table setup add to a very nice ambience
Our food was delicious! Try the calamari! The best part was the service
Our waitress was around just enough
When ordering someone casually said to the birthday girl that she should go ahead and order anything on her special day
The waitress made a mental note about it and brought out a special dessert without being asked
On the house! It was a great added touch
Awesome food and professional service; I have been there several times, but I have never been disappointed
They have a great wine list, and the waiting staff really know their dishes
If you aren't too sure what to order, they are more than ready to give you great recommendations
There is a reason why this place has been #1 or #2 in Zagat's the past few years in popularity
USQ was one of the best dining experiences I have had in NY and I have been to many of the big boys (Le Cirque, River Cafe, Town, etc
) Sure it took me a little while to be seated but the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon before show time
I had an expertly made (if pricey) TT at the bar and waited to be seated
Once seated, the service was excellent and every single item ordered was absolutely incredible
Anyone who reviewed USQ and didn't like the food either doesn't know food or they caught an off day
This place is truly one of NYC's must dine at restaurants
As I entered the restaurant and paused to look at the menu, another patron said don't bother looking, everything is wonderful
It was a joy to be greeted by such friendly, helpful staff, right down to the coat check girl
The waiter was also friendly and helpful with my menu selections
The butternut squash ravioli melted in my mouth
The lamb chops, although thin, were the best I've ever had
The price / value is unbelievable for NYC
I'm a believer!
High prices for poor quality food and extremely poor service-- we were really disappointed, given the reviews
But-- the waiter was a handsome guy, and the dining room is a handsome dining room, so if you care very much about appearances and not at all about what you're eating, this is the place for you
If you care even a little bit about the food, your money could be better spent almost anywhere
This place is ok, but for the price the cuisine is somewhat boring
I doubt that this is the place for a hamburger or tuna sandwich, although expensive versions of these are on the lunch menu
My seafood was a bit too salty and the desserts were decent, like the warm banana tart, but nothing to rave about
The wine list is good
Not the greatest restaurant in town, but certainly in the top percentile
Staff are lovely if a bit green and or jaded (no middle ground that I've seen)
Food is always consistent, comfort oriented and the wine list is superb
Crowd can be a bit of a pain (a lot of self importance in the air)
I prefer to sit at the bar as I don't have to listen to loud, boring conversations from the next table who always seem to be friends of the owner
Def a place I return to from time to time, but not as often as I could
Though pricey, you can't beat the Union Square Cafe for a classy lunch
Try the tuna burger - it's incredible
definatley one of my favorite restuarants in the city
the decor is quite simple, but you never feel stuffy or uneasy
the food is excellent and well prepared and everything on the menu was great
i dont know what the prior review meant when he/she said that the desserts werent that good, because the dish with carmelized bananas as well as the warm chocolate cake were to die for
maybe you do have a very simple palate? but blue water grill is absolutley no comparison b/c i've eaten there as well and the food was just mediocre at best
Went there for lunch
Outstanding! (and a somewhat cheaper option than dinner)
Food was excellent
Good size portions
Good wine list
Service was impeccable
Very nice ambiance
Not stuffy, and not too loud
Brought the kids and the waitstaff treated them like regular customers (though a few patrons gave some disapproving glances)
My visit to Union Square Cafe could be termed a very well-executed dining experience
Although the cuisine was not exceptionally imaginative or innovative, everything was very thoughtfully prepared and there it was clear that there was great attention to detail
The waitstaff was attentive and helpful in making some tough decisions with a menu loaded with appetizing selections
While the appetizers were somewhat run of the mill, many of the entrees were excellent
In particular, the lamb chops and the steak for 2 special were very moist and tasty
The desserts were perhaps the most creative aspect of the meal
The mint-chocolate icebox cake was terrific, as was a chocolate tart
All in all, USC was a great experience and I will definitely go back
We saw on televsion that there is a note from the chef if you get leftovers
we ate there hoping to get a note with our leftovers only to find out there was none
The food was very expensive and tasted so so
For such a famous place they had very few choices on the menu
The menu only pleases a fancy palate but not for the average person
Desserts were too exotic and for chocolate lovers like ourselves there was nothing on the menu to satisfy
We headed next door to Blue Water Grill for dessert and ended up having dessert in the cocktail area
The waitress was extremely nice and stayed with us to chat
The dessert was good and we will go back again to try dinner also
Will not go back to Union Square
I recently went to Union Square Cafe for the first time and I loved it
I liked the atmosphere and the friendly service
I also liked the food
I had an amazing salad with dijon dressing and my boyfriend had the most amazing pasta with a black truffle butter sauce
It was so amazing, he ordered another
I had a wonderful smoked steak with great mashed potatoes and for dessert I had the lemon ice box cake which was amazing!! Our waiter was the best and he brought us another dessert on the house
I think this place is much better than Gramercy Tavern and I will definitely be going back!
Our dinner was one of the best dining experiences we have had in NYC
Wonderful service, knowledgeable advice about the menu and wine list, and the food was great! Definitely more American than French, the hearty lamb and rabbit dishes were perfect for a cold winter evening
Union Square Cafe has a great atmosphere and the food's presentation was magnificent
The service was prompt and friendly
You must try the Steamed Chocolate Cake for dessert
It melts in your mouth and you will beg for more
I almost ordered another one
Every now and then someone on CitySearch writes a scathing review of USC
I can't help but wonder if they ate at the same restaurant I have
I've eaten at Union Square numerous times and can say without reservation that it is one of my absolute favorites
I have never experienced anything but wonderful food and excellent service
In fact, I find the wait staff to be some of the most down-to-earth and well-trained people in the business
For upscale comfort food, this place still has a warm ambiance and nice staff
However, food and service have gotten a bit sloppy
We waited 20+ minutes for our 9pm Friday reservations
In the meantime, the bartender made us marvelous, perfectly-mixed drinks
While the oysters were beautiful, the risotto was a bit on the bland side
Unfortunately, the duck special was too tough despite being still rare and bloody/pink
They also brought us the wrong dessert (I was deathly allergic to the nuts in the one they brought), but they were kind enough not to charge us for it -- since it almost killed me
The staff is still very nice, but certainly not as attentive to detail as they have been in the past
Most disappointing was that the food didn't live up to its usual high standards -- but it was still, admittedly, good-tasting despite its shortcomings

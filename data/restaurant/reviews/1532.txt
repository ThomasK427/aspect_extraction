Definately not healthy
it really just tastes like food that was prepared in some factory and shipped to them to be sold after heating
better off going to mcdonalds = cheaper and better food
This place is a rip off! In the morning a bagel with cream cheese is less than two dollars
At lunchtime I bought a bagel with cream cheese, 2 slices of cheese and a slice of tomato, how much? $6
50
The service sucks! dont waste your time and money, theres plenty around
The service here was excellent
Although the food isn't all that special (good burger, good steak, good chicken pot pie, but the fries and rings are food-service standard issue), Sally's has a great, welcoming vibe, and our waitress was on top of everything and really made us feel at home
This is a great pub for a few after work beers and a burger
There's nothing execptional about the place, but everything you want and expect from a standard pub is there
Beer selection is a bit slim, but seats are plentiful and there are several sports monitors placed about the bar
The place is clean and friendly
It also sports a fairly traditonal Irish/American feel
Not made for bringing in your best date perhaps, but a nice spot for beer with the boys
Friendly bartenders, NFL satellite and good burgers
What more could you ask for?
Mustang Sally's is ok
Nothing to write home about
I have been a few times for convenience
Service was curt, the burgers were ok and filling but not one of the best
Each time I have had there soup it was lacking something (taste wise) Over all its average place, nothing special
Sally's is by far one of my favorite places that I eat/drink each time I visit NYC - every few months that is
Food is delicious and the people are friendly
Fantastic place
Been there over 5 times and I must say each experience was absolutely phenomenol
The service is great for what its worth
They really spoil you and the waitresses are very helpful with menu selection
The trick is to smile and be nice to them, and they will welcome you with a warm heart
Order Bibimbop (platter or dry) for vegetarians!
If you can make it to Dae Dong for lunch during a weekday, it'll be well worth it
The lunch specials offer a variety of lunch boxes that are like Japanese style Bento boxes, except with Korean food
They have Bulgogi, Galbi, salmon and several other dishes on their lunchbox menu
The lunch specials include a side of jabchae, a california roll, a couple of dumplings, sometimes a free beverage, and shikhae (a sweet rice drink) for dessert
It's well worth it
The food outside of the lunch specials is also excellent
Unlike some other Korean restaurants, Dae Dong always has great banchan (sidedishes) and has a wide variety of Korean main dishes to choose from
You are also seated in booths, so you have a certain amount of privacy
I think this is the best Korean restaurant on 32nd
It is just one of the Korean restuarants on 32nd, nothing so special, except for their portions
I think they give you so much cuz the food isn't so tasty
It is a good bargain when you pay average $10 food and get so many dishes of ban chan
I would recommend it to friends if they ask, but I have other recommendations for Korean food that are 10 times better
This restaurant was an incredible value for lunch! It is expensive for dinner, but that is your decision to make
I work nearby and walked right in
The food was fresh superb, the service was non-stop and friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean and pleasing
I paid $12 including tax tip for a beef entree with salad, noodles, rice, a fried dumpling, many free appetizers and a glass of ice water
Like many Koreans abroad, I can't seem to find in NY the replacement for those cheap, tasteful dishes that are available everywhere in Seoul
Often, the Korean food here will taste good, but just an infinitesimal bit different
But Gammiok's gom tang is the real thing - it tastes genuine and it's very good
Gam Mee Ok is famous even in Korea
It is hands-down, the best sul-lung tang in the city
A perfect dish for a cold day or a late night, complemented by the best daikon kimchee
It is a perfect meal, all around
We went here solely on the Citysearch recommends and it turned out to be a great call
Wait staff was very attentive
The waiter steered me towards the Bi Bim Bop because he thought I might not like the Korean Kielbasa, then he showed me how to mix and eat it correctly
Kim Chi was great
Ox-Tail soup too
Potato pancakes delicious
Wife loved her seafood (Bay top shell?) salad
All portions were very big
Best of all - the price was delightful
Next time I'll be more brave and try other dishes
As a Korean, this place is one of a few places I go out for Korean food, especially with when friends and family are visiting from out of town
They even told me this place is one of the attractions Korean tourist go to when they are in NYC
Kim chi, by far other than my monther's, is the best of USA, which is the only side dish you get from here, unlike from other Korean restuarants
They don't full around here with quantities, but concentrate on quantity
Their specialty is Sul Lung tang, but try Soon dae, which is korean sausage
It's always crowded there, but especially during dinner hours, 6 pm - 10 pm, and after club hours, 12 - 5 am
Expect to wait at least 20 min
Gam Mee Ok is a great 24hr place to go after you've been clubbing and need to wind down with some food
Definitely Order their specialty sulong-tang (ox-tail soup; you add your own salt and scallions)
Their kimchi is one of the best I've tasted
The bean-dae-duk (Korean pancake made up of ground beans) is also very tasty
And the great thing is that the food is pretty cheap
There's no real side dishes but it's definitely worth a try!
Very good
A little glitch in the service (the forgot our soup) but otherwise nice
Outstanding value - especially for NYC
5 of us ate for just over $100, including beers
I love korean food and this is the place to go
The bi-bim-bop and the soo-lang-tang are just fabulous and they make the best pajun (pancakes) in all of Koreatown
The menu is limited but whatever they have, they do them well
The decor is original with carved-wood tables in the front and back
They even have the low tables in the back of the restaurant
i can't remember if this place gives free side dishes, it probably does, but what i remember is the amazing kimchi
they bring it out in a little pot and cut it up with scissors right in front of you
delish
the oxtail soup is their speciality, and is good for a hangover
other food is pretty good
good value
be warned, if you come with a korean person and you yourself are not korean, don't expect the staff to acknowledge you
I've repeatedly gone here for my friends who want to meet and eat in Midtown
Korean Town on 32nd is the best for cheap and satisfying meals
This place is small as lines are long by 7:30 PM
If you are scared of Kim Chee (fermented cabbage in spicy brine), give theirs a chance
It's not that nose burning spicy
Order three of the platter dishes on the menu and the scallion pan cakes should be enough
The waitstaff is more than willing to educate you with what sauce goes with what

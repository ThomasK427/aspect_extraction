It's great for a quiet good inexpensive meal
Definitely a must!
With its initmate setting and modern decor, Spice is the perfect place to go for good conversation and a little ambiance, not mention great Thai food at an incredibly reasonable price
In fact, if you don't mind smelling like a bit of curry and peanut oil afterwards, Spice is an ideal place for a casual date
Try Spice for lunch
They offer great specials for not a lot of money
Two appetizers and two main courses cost me around $15
00 my last visit
With its flavorful dishes and laid-back atmosphere, Spice is hot and cool!
The food for takout was horrible
It was bland and and cold
I can't say much for the restaurant in terms of service and decor, but If the food isn't good, it really doesnt matter
definately not recommending
Although it is not the BEST Thai food - it is very cheap and filling and also good for take out
When I was sick with a bad cold I ordered the Chicken Coconut Soup and they delivered it in a jiffy
Lunch specials are from 5- 8 dolloars - almost unheard of on the posh Upper East Side
Great food and very reasonable priced
The service could have been better, but we weren't in a hurry
There were several very large parties, so this may have contributed to the not so attentive staff
Food was yummy - lots of veggie selections
Will be back soon
I go to Spice on University Place all the time and also like the Spice on 2nd Ave
The food is good and the service is pleasant
Try the daily specials for something new or go for the classic pad thai
The food is excellent and very very reasonable for Thai food prices, excellent take-out option
All their dishes and appetizers are good, some dishes can get realy spicey though! If you manage to make it in to eat, the place is small but very funky!
I frequently order from and eat at spice because it is underpriced, reliable thai food
I love their red shrimp curry, summer rolls, exotic salad and pad thai
Everyone I bring to Spice loves it and can't get over the prices
It is a great for a midweek dinner out or for home delivery, not so much for a special night out
I live less than 2 blocks aways and I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and both times were fine- good food for the price and decent service
THEN, I ordered in and my opinion of this restaurant went way down! I ordered my dinner at 7:40 (they told me it would take 30 minutes) and by 8:45, it still hadn't turned up
When I called, they said that the food was already taken and they didn't know where the delivery man was
When he finally showed up at 9:05, I asked him what happened and he said I was busy
Not only was the food late, but it was cold
This is unacceptable!!! Do not order in from this place!
Has been there for years
You get a good meal of whatever you choose and you will not leave hungry
The wait staff is friendly and willing to serve special requests
The Beach Cafe has been in our neighborhood for almost forty years
It's always been great, and is getting better as time goes on
Ive been going to the Beach for years, recently I took my kids after NYC show
The service and food as usual was wonderful
Staff was courteous and helpful
I highly reccommend this fine dining establishment to anyone who wants quality for their dollar!
The Beach Cafe, which has been there for decades, is a very pleasant neighborhood restaurant/bar with a cozy friendly feel
The food is usually good and reasonably priced
The restaurant is quite popular and the tables are often full
In today's world of chic high priced Manhattan restaurants, it nice to find a low-key fun place to dine like this
I went to the Beach Cafe for the first time ever last night, and I can't believe what I have been missing
The food is delicious and unpretentious, which is very refreshing
The menu is full of old favorites, such as chicken Marsala (delicious) and meatloaf with peas, mashed potatoes, and gravy
The selection is superb, and they are quite generous with the portions
The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is attractive and mellow, and the service is very polished
Highly recommended to anyone looking for a delicious meal that is more like home cooking than something gimicky and overpriced

Food is mediocre for a $$$$ restaurant
Hardly creative, old style french, botox crowd
Great wine list
Excellent service
NO BAR
huge negative
From Houston, Texas--get to NYC about every other year--and this is one of our FAVORITE NYC places! Just as in Houston--very often the FOUR STAR places can be/are FLOPS! I am always curious as to who does these reviews?? We Dine around a lot, and have travelled a lot of the world, so even tho we are TEXANS--arent total hicks
Folks--this is a VERY GOOD--maybe great restaurant! It is 'off the tourist track--and maybe doesnt PAY FOR EXPOSURE?? An 80 year old cynic
Entrance side of the restaurant has no heating, and customers get seated in the cold while staff is seated in the back near heating
Afternoon menu is limited to few items, most of them only remotely french inspired
Overall, may be a nice place for evenings but in winter, to avoid unless you like to freeze yourself
I used to be a big fan of La Goulue for years until I got tired of being imposed on what to eat, when to eat and what the minimum is to spend
The service there is good but pretentious and that where they are missing the points
My girlfriends and I were visiting New York this past weekend and were hoping to find a fun place for Sunday brunch that serves good French food and is a great place to do some people watching
With La Goulue we found it all!! Fantastic French food, a very good pre-fixed brunch menu and Georgio Armani and Ivana Trump at the next table (Georgio and Ivana were not eating together, they were at two separate tables)
Everything from muffins and breads in a bread basket to coffee was absolutely deliscious
My tuna tartar was the best I ever had
It's a bit expensive but well worth it
One complain we felt rushed by our waiter
The place was crowded but there is no excuse to ask us to leave the table before we even finished our coffee!
This is a lovely little French bistro on Madison Avenue
Each time I have dined, be it for a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner, the food and service have been exceptional
Yes the tables are close in proximity, but that is typical for cozy New York eateries
Another pro is that in the summer you can sit and watch the world go by at an outdoor table
It does not get any better
It felt as though we were dining in a traditional cafe in the heart of Paris but for the same money you can find better French food in New York
The service was pleasant and the frites were above average
This restaurant is for UES locals and Madison Avenue shoppers
It is not a destination type restaurant
I believe this place does business becuase people living close by find it to be a convenient choice
it is certainly not a destination restaurant
For a weeknight steak with wine, it is not a bad choice but only if you can afford it
Not a weekend night place, not happening, not hip but definitely very Upper East Sidey with ladies of leisure and men who provide that leisure:-)
Thank you, La Goulue, for you warm hospitality on a horrible afternoon in april
We were cold and wet, and just needed a drink to warm us
The Maitre' d was sympathetic to our predicament and gave us a table for drinks - during brunch hours
We look forward to returning for dinner, after such hospitality was extended to us

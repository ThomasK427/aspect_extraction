I had to order take out because their place gets busy often
Overall a pleasant experience to enjoy over and over
You won't be disappointed
No other Thai restaurant on 9th can do it quite like Q2
It's new and I just go for the Chef Specials
My boyfriend had the Salmon Teriyaki and I had the Calamari Salad
and we took our friends out the week after
You really can't go wrong when you get free glasses of Merlot
Definitely will order take out for lunch
Recently this place renovated and it looks great compared to some of the other mom pop places in Hells Kitchen
I typically go for lunch because the service is fast and the price is right
Not too cramped so eating there is enjoyable
My best bud and I have no shame
We just moved into a nice condo on 10th Ave, and have been grabbing three or four dinners from Aura every week for the past month
The food's that good
I get the beef salad and a side of jasmine rice 'cause the sirloin is, hands down, the best I've had
When I'm in the mood for sauteed noodles, I order the pad see ew chicken
All the flavors are just right
My tastebuds agree
Awesome service
My girlfriends and I visit Aura every Thursday night after happy hour
We take the 1/9 from Columbia and walk a coupla blocks down from 34th
We don't really go there to take in the atmosphere since it fits a limited number of people
Just go there for the food! My fave dishes are the Panang Curry with brown rice and Pad Cashew
If you ask for extra spicy, they'll give it to you the right way
(I'm 1/4 Thai and that's the way my mom makes it
) I can't ask for a better, more authentic place
When you're thousands of miles away from home, it's nice to have a place that offers gourmet meals at decent prices
And for dessert, mango with sweet sticky rice, please
I ordered from Aura about three times this week and my co-workers laugh at me for being so consistent and boring
I can't help it
The food is to die for!!! (especially the chicken noodle soup)
Oh, I can never have enough of their desserts
I don't know about other people's experiences, but when I went there after watching some soccer with friends today, we left the Aura full and satisfied
I mean, it's not the fanciest place on the block so my expectations were minimal
Everything was great
The girls there were sweet to us and accommodated our party of six -- even when the place was full
I ordered the Massamun shrimp
I never had it with avocados before
The curry was so rich and tasty
We got a little tipsy off of their wine selection and a couple rounds of Singha
We all walked out with menus and business cards
Def will go back with my in-laws to try their famous duck dishes
The food at this restaurant is excellent however the service leaves much to be desired
I frequent this restaurant at minumum 2x and at maximun 4x's a week
Unfortunately today I experienced the worst level of service I ever have in my life at any restaurant
The waitress at the bar was very nasty to me because she mistakenly took an order for thai ice tea from me when I asked for thai lemonade in a to-go cup
She tried to argue with me and insisted that I in fact ordered two beverages at the same time
I decided to let it go but when my bill came the ice tea was still on it
She snatched the bill out of my hand and corrected it
When I gave her my payment I explained to her that her attitude was uncalled for and not appreciated
She simply waved her hand and walked away from me in the middle of me talking
I asked to speak with the manager but I was informed that there was no manager on site
This disrespectfuly service has caused me to decide that I cannot go back there
My family goes there for dinner 'cause the restaurant isn't too spacious
I think their service has improved tremendously over the past few months, but you have to be patient
Try their Thai iced tea (not too sweet but just perfect), Duck Salad and Pad Thai
(I know they're boring choices, but Aura's got the basics to a T
FAVE dining spot on the weekends!!!
I walked by Aura last week, read some raving reviews posted on their storefront and decided to try some of their specialties
A bit skeptical of food critics but in absolute agreement
The duck roll, duck noodle broth and mango salad get me so excited
They've got me hooked, and now, the waitresses know me by name
Lunchtime seems to be really hectic so I stop by to grab some take out before heading home
I found this place purely by accident
Dining options aroundMSG/Penn station arent the greatest, but Aura is a cute place with really good food
I usually dont venture over to 9th but glad I did
Well My husband and I had no idea where to go for dinner this past Saturday Night, we wanted to go someplace different
yet still good and reasonable
we searched on citysearch and found the Black Pearl
I was more than happy with our choice
The service was excellent, the place was busy, yet the hostess and owner came by to make sure we were OK and asked if we needed anything
You gotta try the MANGO-TINI's they are soooo yummy! Garnished with a fresh piece of juicy mango too! For an appetizer we had crabcakes which were delicious as well
And for our entrees, I had the lobster ravioli which were hear shaped
and in a lobster bisque light creame sauce! scruptious! (they also add a couple of pieces of shrimp on top also!) my husband got a Frutta De Mare which was half a lobster, mussles, clams and shrimps over a ton of linguine in a fra diavalo sauce
it was a HUGE portion!! and the best thing it was under 30
00!!!! he eats like a pig and he couldnt even finish it there was sooo much pasta and fresh shellfish!  we also had dessert, a dish with 3 diff sorbets and fresh berries!  Def
cant wait to go back to the black pearl
its in brooklyn, yet I felt like i was in NYC, cool and funky
yet different without being over the top or trying to hard
Def a great romantic spot
yet its also a fun place for a group of friends
Ohh i cant wait to go back with my girlfriends
:)
Wow is all I can say! The food is amazing, the drinks are amazing, and the service is great! I definitely recommend the black pearl salad, the salad with goat cheese and pinenuts, the filet mignon, but no matter what you get everything is delicious and the portions are enough to satisfy any appetite and take the rest home! The restaurant is gorgeous! THe restaurant also has a room that you can have small parties in! Make a reservation or just stop in for drinks, you won't be disappointed, I wasn't!
This is a tough one
A friend and I went there on a non-busy week night
We waited 15 minutes before the waitor acknowledged us
We ordered a $36 bottle of wine and we both ordered $20 entrees
The waitor came to our table once to bring us the bottle after we ordered and we didn't see him again until the bill came! he never refilled our glasses, brought us bread or even brought us our entrees
We had to ask the busboy if bread came with our meal, which it did and we received after waiting about 30 minutes
The food took forever, but was absolutely delicious
I am hoping the stale service was a one shot deal because it was deplorable for what we paid for dinner!
Found this place on citysearch and the reviews paid off
Went there for Sunday brunch today and was pleasantly surprised
Now to be honest I chose it based on the unlimited Bloody Mary, Mimosa factor but the food itself as well as decor were excellent
They started us off with a small basket of mini muffins that were very tasty
For our meal we both chose the eggs benedict (per the waiters suggestion) the hollandaise sauce was tasty and what I appreciated is they didn't smother everything in the sauce, but were very quick to offer an extra side to my friend who likes more sauce then I do
Most surprising there were actually three servings on the plate not the standard two
Even the pineapple side served with it had a pleasant flavor

The wait was long
Very long
But I had heard so much about this place that I couldn't pass it up
After being seated by a very kind, but quite stressed, young lady, we took in the room and menu
Beautiful room
Our waiter was superb
He suggested a unique and wonderful wine I had never heard of called a Rotgipfler(he wrote it down for me)
We were so happy with the wine, that we let him pick our meal
Squash Soup and Avocado/Crab Salad to start
Lamb Loin and Wiener Schnitzel second
And two cakes to die for
Best coffee I've ever had
I plan on comming back often
I just hope the line is shorter and my waited is there
Maybe it was the weather that day, but something about my whole experience chilled me to the bone
I remeber the desserts there being better than Vienna itself, but I didn't remember the service being an abomination
With a sea of tables to chose from, we were seated at an open table next to the booths
Alas! Within moments a booth opened up and we requested to move to it (no silverware or water at this point)
We asked the waiter and we were informed that the second [his word] you sit down you may not move again
The manager was requested, of course
This is not a dancehall the manager informed us three times
Dancehall? (It's not 1952 either and this is one slow dancehall
) They made no exceptions to the rule and we made no exceptions but to leave to the click of his heels toward the kitchen
Don't make the mistake of dropping in on the weekend during lunch hour
the 40 minute wait was more than an hour and by the time we thought of giving up, we had already invested too much time waiting
price you pay for visiting a museum cafe on the weekend (they handout complimentary brochures to pass the time !) The food is German/Austrian/Eastern Europeon
you know meat/potatoes/soup/salad or in this case sausages which were good, the egg salad sandwich was interesting
but skip the main course
the desserts are exquisite
Must try the peach cheesecake
(light, fluffy, and nothing like the cream cheese variety you get everywhere else) the chocolate hazelnut cake was heavenly
the coffee was very good too
a little pricey for a cafe, I loved the ambience and the waitstaff is very helpful ( and opinionated!) if you can't make up your mind
I go here often when I'm up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, since it's just a few blocks away
The food is quite good, the location is great, and the place has a nice atmosphere and feel to it
Service is friendly also, but beware of one thing
While the desserts are very good, they can run out of a certain dessert at times
This happened to me, and while it's easy enough to pick some other tasty dessert on the menu, it is something to keep in mind
One of my favorite places for brunch on the Upper East Side, Cafe Sabarsky has delectable Austrian treats in a beautiful atmosphere
You'll think you've been transported into a chic coffeeshop in Vienna, with the elegant decor and polished service
Don't miss the streudel and the tasty sandwiches, or the coffee treats
Great location across from Central Park and also conveniently on the ground floor of the terrific Neue Galerie
The best Chai I have ever tasted - and that's warm OR iced
Luscious deserts, friendly staff and gorgeous, inviting turquoise walls
Candles everywhere, charming decor and gelato in the spring
I love sitting along the bench against the wall among the millions of multi-colored pillows, reading a book, although seating is very limited, so if you see a spot, grab it, quick!
I loved lunch here so much that I decided to have my graduation party here in May
The restaurant's bar and dining area has been recently renovated and the modren decor is lovely
The crabcakes are a must and the Fra diavolo is excellent
It is truly a gem in an area filled with pizza joints and fast food places!
This is a great spot for a quick lunch
They have wonderful salads, sandwiches and soups
I particularly like the salmon salad with the carrot-ginger dressing
And, they deliver!
The Scene With sage-colored booths, rearrangeable formica tables set with paper napkins and funky fish dioramas on white-washed walls, Dish feels far removed from the Lower East Side's busy bodegas and shabby-chic boites
The big, brightly lit space could be a college-town diner: Young, haphazard service, upbeat pop music and a casual crowd follows suit
The Food The kitchen puts a fresh spin on "meat and two veg
" Pick one of six "big dishes," such as spicy meatloaf with sweet-sour onions or succulent lamb shank, then add two heaping sides from a long, innovative list including zesty horseradish beets, corn pudding and remarkably good peanut-sauced sweet potatoes
But pair wisely: Limp-skinned smoked chicken needs more boost than iceberg wedges topped with blue cheese and bacon, and three-cheese macaroni buries overbreaded catfish
Flavors are integrated better in "small dishes" and sandwiches: Creamy codfish puree with caper biscotti and toasted roast beef with arugula are favorites
As a Floridian who travels to NY often for business, I can say that this is one of the best comfort food type restaurants recommended to me by my many New York friends
If I lived in the neighborhood I'd eat at Dish every day
Great service, even better food and the crowd is fun, good looking and obviously know a great restaurant when they eat at one
Very nice space, the staff was very friendly
Most everything we had was delightful - my favorite being the lamb sausage app
Our Dish experience was okay
The muffins, maccheese fish was great - but there were other menu items (sides) that were really bland - I was surprised
Their p/butter torte-type of cake was delicious
I'd like to try their brunch - the menu looks good
I'd try it again, but I'd not order the same things exactly
Deserves a 2nd chance
7/20/03 - the 2nd chance is Brunch
Must go! It is absolutely fabulous - much better than my dinner experience!!
We've been to Dish 2 times now for Brunch and had a great meal both times
Went to dish the other night and loved it! There were 12 of us and we ate drank so much for practically nothing
The food was cooked to perfection (even my $17
50 steak)
The wine was well priced
The sangria delicious
And the service was perfect
We loved it and will go back again and again
The cheese muffins served before the meal and the butter cookies given to us after dinner, were the highlight of our dining experience
The menu is very creative but the food doesn't deliver
Overall, the food was lacking in flavor
Well, looks like they fixed the cold/bland food problem! Went there on a monday night and everything we ordered tasted great and was the right temp! We ordered 5 different sides, 2 small dishes, 1 big dish and a bottle of decently priced wine and got out of there for $80 total! Service was great, food was great, but the ambiance could use some work
Would probably go again and would definitely recommend it to friends
Boring, neutral food, uninspired atmosphere (very bright, even on a Friday night, very cafeteria-like, not a whole lotta people even in there)
The food was completely un-noteworthy
I don't even have anything else to say about it except don't waste your time
ate here twice since it opened - bad service, cold tasteless food the first time
a couple dishes had promise so we tried again - second time food and service were WORSE and they had RAISED the prices (after only a couple weeks since they opened) - what a joke! but the bigger joke is that they have cooking classes upstairs! I hope people who think about taking those classes read these reviews first
I chose Dish for my birthday celebration b/c it looked really cute and mellow
Although the waitstaff were nice- the food was cold, the orders got mixed up, and my friend ordered the roasted chicken which was served to him raw twice
The third time they served him the same piece of chicken- at least they didn't charge him for it
I thought I couldn't go wrong with the mashed potatoes, but even they tasted strange and were served cold
My friends that ordered sandwiches were relatively pleased, but in all, Dish needs to get some new chefs
I'll probably wait a few months to try it again, if it's still around
I was looking forward to trying this new restaurant, but overall it was very disappointing
It was supposed to be a good value place, 1 entree and 2 sides for $14
50 (I think it was $12 when it first opened?)

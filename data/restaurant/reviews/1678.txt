Will be back again soon
We went to the Battery Gardens during the Downtown for Dinner-week and that was pretty good
But we saw the normal menu which in our opinion is way too expensive for what the restaurant is
The athmosphere lets people think this would be a very luxury restaurant but then they have Beatles-music running or 80ies music which just doesn't fit
Also we had our food for a while when they were bringing the wine
And the portions were more than organized on the plates
we could count the spinach leaves
I lunch at Gerardi's frequently and look forward to returning each time
Good Italian dishes, very good fish, and delicious salads
The menu is ample, the portions are hearty, the prices fair, and the service is good
Wine by the glass is a bit expensive, so watch what you order
The burgers, sandwiches, and platters at Kelly's are above average compared to the other Irish Pubs in the neighborhood
Friendly waitresses, and relatively fast service
Nothing gourmet here, but you'll get a decent meal at a fair price
Zigolini's is a self-serve cafe which serves very tasty, good quality sandwiches, pastas, and salads
Though the quarters are tight, you can usually get a table
The portions are ample
Prices are a bit high, but typical for the neighborhood
Lunch and soda runs $7 to $10
A decent spot for a quick lunch
What a great find!! Lunch buffet is only $7
95
You can also order a la carte, but I get the all you can eat buffet every time
Good food, friendly service
Great, fast lunch spot if you work downtown
I've been going about once a week for the past 6 months and have never had a bad experience
While this isn't a Nobu the food's a great value for the price
Sumptuous cooked dishes and fresh sushi
I would recommend for a meeting or lunch with friends
The sushi here is terrific
I have been going for over 5 years and it's always fresh, service is friendly
One of my favorites!
The Scene This Financial District establishment is a place where business can be done over a thick cut of steak
Crisp white tablecloths drape the seating areas and chandeliers dangle from decorated ceilings in the formal dining room
A full-service bar is attached to the dining room where patrons can order from the restaurant menu or a scaled-down bar menu
Trained waitstaff offer impeccable service
The Food The menu offers classic steakhouse fare and all-American treats
Oyster Rockefeller arrive with warm melted cheese and clams casino are accented with bacon
The Delmonico's salad is a delightful mix of greens, beets, marinated artichokes and peppers and mozzarella tossed with a light balsamic vinaigrette
Tender filet mignon arrives in bearnaise; shrimp scampi simmers in a light buttery, lemon broth
A piece of New York cheesecake makes for an ideal finish
its the oldest eatery in the apple
And its still one of the best business lunch spots out there
The meat is well served and rather delicious
The decor takes you back to another time
But prepare to spend because the guy at the table next to you just might be Hank Greenberg
We just moved to the financial district and thought it would be worth trying the famous Delmonico's for the first time
unfortunately it was not worth it
The ambience was all wrong, the bar opened into the main dining room causing the noise to flow into the room
The lighting was wrong creating an almost cafeteria feel
Although the wine was very good; it was quite over priced
The wait staff was on point; but the heart was not there; they seemed almost mechanical
For the food; we got the oysters as an appetizer; although they were tasty they were very small
The steak was the worst part though; the filet's were large but the meet was tough
Overall it was an establishment that went ary
It was not worth the price
Basically, they treated us funny b/c we were ordering from the restaurant week
The food was good, but the portions were really small
Service was ok--but I asked for a specific wine
the waiter said he didn't know
He asked someone I think, but still came back with a lame-I don't know answer
I wish I had ordered the filet from the regular menu
I went to Delmonico's for the first time last night, and it truly lived up to its reputation
We were a party of four, and all ordered from the prix fixed menu available for Restaurant Week
The service was fantastic - attentive, prompt, and polite
We were there for almost three hours, and never felt rushed, even at the peak of dinnertime
The decor was bright and elegant, while also exhibiting a historical ambiance
The food was extremely flavorful, especially the hash browns, with more than sufficient portions
The best was their recommended wine - a smooth, sweet, and flavorul Cabernet for only $30/bottle! This restaurant is a NYC institution, and I would gladly go back any time!
Me and a friend just visited Delmonico's and it was wonderful
The service was unbeatable
The staff was of the best I've seen! I would recommend this place to anyone that loves steak and wants the best
Avoid Delmonico's during Restaurant Week
Not only are you charged $35 for a sub par meal, but the portions were minuscule
The steak was the thinnest cut I've ever seen, the potato and spinach portions were the size of a quarter and and the chocolate cake for dessert was served to me frozen
If I had known all of this, I would have ordered from the real menu
The entertaining Sligo duo at Delmonico's bar, challenges Sammy and Diane's
Great service, great wit, great smile, and a staple part of a NYC/American milestone establishment
See for yourself
!!

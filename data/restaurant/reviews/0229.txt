We dined at Nino's on a snowy evening in December
The food and service were superb and the dining experience was completely wonderful
We had very good risotto with seafood and a veal special with prosciutto and broccoli rabe
The salad with beet and goat cheese was great
Very good and reasonably priced wine list and great tartuffo for dessert
We can't wait to dine there again
Our hotel concierge suggested this place so on a whim we tried it out and were pleasantly surprised
We were seated promptly without reservations on a Tues nite
The menu offers both a la carte and prix fixe for 3 course dinner (at $30 you can't beat it but it is limited in selection)
Wine list is reasonably priced and favors Italians but limited in variety
We opted for the a la carte specials that nite which were excellent
I'm not normally a red meat eater but I was inspired by the beef carpaccio special appetizer and was not disappointed
Great ambiance for business and/or intimate gathering
I travel alot on business and this was, by far, one of the best meals I've had in this city in a while without having to reserve far in advance for a table
It's definitely on my top 20
Thanks!
I would have rated the food and given this restaurant an overall rating of 10, if I had tried more dishes
But as it was I only had the filet mignon and it was perfect
I've eaten a lot of filet of beef in some of the beefiest and finest restaurants in the City and other than my home cooked filet, this was in a class all it's own
The decor is elegant but understated and the service is just as perfect as the beef
Originally from Miami
went to NY city on 2/14/03
Excellent food and service
very small and romantic
The ambience is beautiful
Food price was reasonable for meals
I would definitely go back next time I'm in the city
This is the place for Italian on the Upper East side
Portions are generous enough for you to share with your friends or take home
Could be romantic or a great place to gather with friends
I love their bread and the fact that the bottled water is free, flat or sparkling
Unfortunately, their soda is always flat
I always leave their very full, but be prepared to be thirsty later on; food can be salty
I went there with a large party for my brother's graduation from college and we had a great time! No complaints from anyone in my family, which was miraculous
they are usually very fussy
The food was tasty and the prices were good (almost everyone stuck to single portions)
The service was very good as well
I have been there twice already! Both times I have really enjoyed the food! They give a great amount, enough for lunch tomorrow
I went with a large party, the service was prompt and gracious
They even offered an after dinner drink, on the house! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks for a recommendation
I intend on returning there to celebrate my birthday! It is that good!
Me and my parents have tried this place 3 times in the last 6 months
If wasn't for the good food, we would not have returned
Can't find less service on the UES
Waiters much more interested on what's on TV then on our needs as custumers
We will be back, because the food is really good and the prices are right, but if you don't want to have to wait FOR THE NEXT COMERCIAL BREAK TO GET SERVICE, TRY SOMEPLACE ELSE!!
I have been twice in this restaurant with my wife and friends,the atmosphere is not bad even the service is mediocre,to be an italian restaurant I notice that the staff were almost Albanians as for the food I expected more for what you pay,the food is not big deal the main course portion are quite small and too simple,I know they have another place downton I will give a try to that one to see the difference
I went with a group of people to celebrate a birthday for one of us and it was a holiday evening so they had a special menu
When the reservation was made we told them we didn't want the special menu since we were doing a birthday, not the holiday and they said fine
When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted
excuse me but isn't that his job??? The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else
The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly
I went with a group of 6
We ordered a salad, appetizer, and three entrees
I was full, but not stuffed by the large, but manageable portions
The food was good, but not spectacular
It's a decent value for the price
The Scene Mi's eclectic setting has as much individuality as its menu
The slender interior is decorated in sunny tones, with pink-putty walls and green glass-topped tables--a female mannequin in an elaborate red kimono sits in a museum-like display case in back
Servers are diligent and friendly
The Food Though a gleaming sushi bar occupies the center of the room, don't be fooled--Mi's real fireworks are found on the Pan-Asian a la carte menu
The kitchen scores some of its biggest hits by pitting sweetness against spice--watermelon sorbet sends a cooling wave through a jalapeno-fired hamachi ceviche, while pickled lotus root chills the burn of the red pepper jus served with a perfectly steamed Chilean sea bass
A passion fruit souffl with coconut sorbet is well worth the 20-minute wait
this restaurant displays its uniqueness through its twist on japanese cuisine
the food is delicious and highly recommended
The service is a little somber, but the food is fantastic
There is a reason this place is always full with a big crowd waiting
Get there early on weekend evenings or you might have a long wait
Specializes in South Indian
Good food and a great value at lunch (try the $7
95 specials)
Service was prompt and my meal was superb
Although Dosai (an Indian crepe) is the restaurant's specialty, other items on the menu were also quite tasty (although the Indian Donut was colder than I expected)
Those of you who are carnivores may not care for it though
Nevertheless, Pongal is ideal for vegetarians and those of you looking for something different
I like Indian food, but I do get bored with the same meals served at every restaurant
What a pleasure this place is
No kitchy decor - just cool, sleek, and exotic
Service was fine
The food is definitely Indian, but focusing on South Indian, which you don't see as much
I was reluctant to visit a vegetarian place, but I was marvelously pleased with this place
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it
I started going to dosa hut more after that
If i go to pongal now its because i have a client to take for lunch/dinner as the place has a better decor
I ordered my dish which said onions and peppers in it
It said NOTHING about green chillis
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up
I was highly disappointed by their service and food
They argued with me saying that i should have known that peppers mean green chillies
I said I thought it was green peppers how was I supposed to know it was going to have chillies in it
One of the few restaurants in NYC to focus on South Indian cuisine
The food here is very good, even if the ambience leaves something to be desired
Make sure to try the dosa, which is excellent
But be warned: the portions are enormous
We'd spent months researching possibilities for our kids' rehearsal dinner party--when we met Sam Martinez, the very affable and most professional owner of Rialto, our search was over
The ambience, casual with an edge, set the tone for our party--a chance for friends and families to meet, mix and, mingle and, most of all to enjoy themselves
Everyone raved about everything! Sam and his excellent staff did whatever it took to make this event a smashing success--he told us not to worry about anything, just to show up and enjoy! He was so right--we enjoyed every minute and, most importantly, so did our kids and our guests
We had our rehearsal dinner here and everything was wonderful
The food is good, there was something for everyone, and it is an incredible value

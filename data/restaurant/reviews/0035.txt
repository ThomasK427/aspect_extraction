Gee thanks! All of us left that night feeling disappointed and angry
The nachos were good, the food was so-so
The bathrooms were disgusting and small
The entertainment was mostly for kids, and the service was slow
I wouldn't go back again
Go if you have kids (not too young) -- they'll like it
The restuarants ambience was great
The waitstaff and entertainers did an excellent job
We had a really great time eating and looking around
We will definately visit again
This place was fantastic
There were plenty of young kids having a blast here, and plenty of older kids as well
The characters were very entertaining, and while the prices are a little steep, it is well worth the cost
It's a bit theme-park-y, but I thoroughly enjoyed this place
It helps that I'm a fan of the source material --old black and white movie serials, pulps about adventurers and their clubs, etc
The food was decent, as I recall, but not super-memorable
The place could get a bit loud, but I loved every bit of the atmosphere

When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza! Their Margarita is best I've had since I've returned from Naples! The tomatoes, the crust, the mozzarella--everything is perfect! Brava La Pizza Fresca!
I came here with a friend and we both had really delicious pastas
mine was pesto linguini with shrimp and hers linguini with a pomodoro sauce and lobster
both were really great, but came out a little warm (not hot)
However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT
Still, nice service and the desserts were great
Lovely tiramisu and a DELICIOUS molten chocolate cake that was incredibly rich and wonderful
Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor
I've eaten here many times and find myself continuing to come back
Maybe because if you want to eat authentic Neapolitan pizza, this is the only place you can go in NYC
The thickness of the pizza, the amount of cheese, olive oil they put on, etceverything is balanced
Also, the ingredients they use for their menu are of very good quality
And who else has this great wine list to go with pizza? They do their best to make you comfortable while you are there since their staff hasn't changed in years
And don't forget Tiramisu for dessert
It is a killer!!!
I have eaten at La Pizza Fresca serveral times and have never been disppointed
I've arranged a group dinner, the party of 12, we had such a great time and were treated very well
the service was really great
We tried several different kinds of wine (their wine list is amazing) our wine knowledgeable waiter poured wine equally (12 people!!) and very professtionally
and he changed and set our wine glasses for each wine very promptly and attentively, always checked if we need something and we are having a good time, very courteous!! and made us feel so at home and relaxing
Actually I added tips our waiters next day
i just wanted to show our appreciation
My friends fell in love with their authentic Neapolitan Pizza
no wonder
oh don't forget to order their tiramisu
I'm big fan of it!
Thank you, La Pizza Fresca again we had such a lovely time and great service and fabulous food
great wine list (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine
After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES! (food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine
We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us
This was on a Tuesday night
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together
i know we're talking about italian here
but such remark depicts the worldly somelier/owner/janitor of LPF, who is a true gourmand savvy not only in wine but in the basics of good eat
LPF's simply delicious and fantasically authentic neopolitan style pizza is excellente
my usual 1st course that can easily turn into the 2nd and 3rd
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu
I've grown up on Italian foods and wines and this place is the best
The pasta dishes are as close to what my Italian mother cooks and the pizza, for those of you who enjoy Neapolitan pizza, is very good
Don't be fooled by big name Italian restaurants in the area, often they try too hard and stray from the culinary tradition
By keeping everything simple and making sure all the ingredients are fresh (and, in most cases, imported directly from Italy), they remain much truer to the food I've had while in Italy
The cooks and chef are all Italian
If I have any complaints they are aimed only at the meat dishes, they are good but just not nearly as impressive as the rest of the menu
Also, have dessert
I had a party of 9 reservation and was very disappointed at the service
The atmosphere was nice but we were completely ignored
There was a different of 8 at a table across from us who recieved the waiters utmost attention
From pouring thier wine for the guests to promptly taking thier orders
I don't know what the issue was but it annoyed my guests as well
The pizza was not as good as I had expected
Now, I'm aware it's not easy to please a large party but if we weren't even given the opportunity
Never agian
This place really was not that special
Went there with my bf and another couple on a Friday night
When we arrived, it was still fairly empty, but by the time it neared 8:00pm, the restaurant was packed with ppl waiting at the bar for a table
The pizza portion is really good; the pizza was very tasty, not your typical crunchy thin crust pizza
But as other reviewers had stated, the crust is chewier with a slight hint of charred dough on the bottom
I had the quattro stagioni but I think I will try the margherita next time
For those who crave pasta try the tagliatelle with sausage in a black truffle cream sauce
So goood!!   Overall very pleasant evening! Waiters were nice (not overly friendly as the place was quite busy) but always made it around to our table to refill our wine and water glasses
Would definitely recommend and return!
The food is excellent
Great service, servers are all very friendly
Extensive wine list, good selections too
Wide variety of pastas
Didn't get tired of the pasta, like I usually do halfway through a pasta dish
You'll be pleased if you want authentic Italian food
The pizzas are a MUST TRY, hence the name
I've had the tuna steak also, and it was made just perfect
And for dessert, go for the sorbets, absolutely outstanding
Cozy and romantic- perfect for a date
An A+ for this rare find
With a chef from Liguria, Italy, authentic Neapolitan brick oven pizza and one of the most impressive Italian wine lists I've ever seen, this was the real deal! Our dinner of Pesto Lasagna and a classic pizza Margherita with a great bottle of Chianti was simple and delicious
The home-made tiramisu was a great way to finish an already excellent meal
Thanks La Pizza Fresca!
For those of you who have been to Naples and who appreciate true Neapolitan pizza--you'll be pleasantly surprised by La Pizza Fresca
Its margherita is clearly the best in New York

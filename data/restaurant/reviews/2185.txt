Fish is fresh and the rolls were quite good
Ambience is far better than your typical sushi place
Its a bit on the expensive side
If anyone knows ANYTHING about the Japanese culture,then they would agree with me when I say this place is a REAL TRADITIONAL JAPANESE RESTARAUNT
The sushi they serve here is the EXACTLTY the same as eating out in Japan
They specialize in torro(who knew there were so many varieties of this fish)and I would also suggest their negimaki
They also have private zashiki rooms(with tatami floors,japanese flower arrangements,etc)and the waitresses all wear kimonos
Not like Nobu,where they sell only by name,not quality
If you are looking for sushi the way most Japanese prefer sushi then this is the place for you
Good quality fish
Good selection
Quiet and clutter free
But if you prefer non-authentic Americanized tasting sushi, then you'd prefer a place like Haru
I went to Sushiden on a Friday night around 8:00, the place was pretty empty, we had reservations, but we didnt need them
Ordering was a bit disappointing, they have a large selection of different fish, but it seemed like everyone I tried to order they were out of
How can a sushi bar not have surf clam and scallop, but have three types of Torro? And then at 9:30/9:45 our waitress came by telling us that is was last call, that they were closing down the sushi bar at 10:00 and if we wanted anything else we would have to order it now
I dont live in NYC but I cant remember ever going to a restaurant that closed around 10:00
With so many sushi restaurants in NYC, I dont foresee myself going back there all too soon
The quality of the fish was pretty good, but not the freshest we have ever had
The portions of the sushi/sashimi packages were very small yet overpriced
We have had fresher fish and more generous portions at better prices at Haru
Also extremely slow service
We were not surprised to notice that half of the restaurant was empty on a Friday Night
One of the best Sushi you will find in NYC
Excellent service, newly renovated and convenient from my office in Midtown Manhattan
Private tatami rooms upstairs is great when you have a guest!
Better than Nobu and frequented primarily by Japanese expats
Our Lobster sashimi was served live
So 'freshness'
well, enough said
Though expensive, the fare is absolutely worth it
My score of nine for the ambiance is second only to the chic atmosphere of Bond Street which, thanks to the celebrity stampede of late, is now nothing more than a nostalgic memory
The food was excellent and the service was great! I had a wonderful experience overall!
Food was decent
We were the first ones in at 5PM
Hostess lead us to our table all the way at the end (makes no difference as the place isn't so big) Did not have any chicken items, that was strange, so I tried the simmering pork
Taste good, although I doubt it's healthy with its healthy portion of lard
The men's set wasn't appealing and the ladies set was good, but restricted to ladies
Had the assorted katsu
nothing special
Food was prepared quick
Service was so-so
Great place for katsu (fried porkchop)
Decent portions
menu with all the sets can be confusing can be misleading, but still makes a good quick dinner place
All they need is a better waitstaff and this place will be great!
I was disappointed at the snow crab cream croquette and the 10pcs of kushiage was the worst and felt disgusting
Others were not good enough as well
I am not going to be the place again
I've been Japan several times
Porkchop over rice is the same as those I had in Japan
Reasonable price
Liked the fast service, we got the men's set and the ladies' set
highlights were the pork simmered in sauce appetizer, cream croquette, and agedashi tofu
the pinnacotta and pumpkin (flan) pie were good also
I went there for lunch a couple of times but whenever I went there (even though we pinpointed our order on menu), waitress messed up our order and they never said sorry
And even before we got our food, manager gave us check
Also we're the first table was taken, but we got the food last! Food is soso
katsu and curry seem their speciality but very greasy
And everything smells fishy
I don't want to go there anymore
Never!
this place is amazing - esp
if you are a fan of tonkatsu! You will experience quite an authentic tonkatsu experience from amazing shredded cabbage w/ dressing, fresh delicious sesame dipping sauce and the best tonkatsu! go now!!
Tenderloin katsu with curry is always satisfying
Makes for a pricy lunch though at $10
Large Japanese clientele speaks for itself
Great Service and generous portions makes this a great Italian place for lunch and dinner
Try the 4 cheese ravioli- but beware it also has blue cheese- try the spinach ravioli and the seafood anti-pasti
We went with a group of 7 and everybody liked the food
The rest was OK
The bread was not spectacular, and we were too stuffed for dessert- but it did look good
The interior was nice but did not leave an impression
i liked how the waitresses wear kimonos
food and its presentation was unique
baby bee appetizer and gingko nuts were wonderful, and roasted edamame very good
the ramen was good
I wouldn't come here for sushi or sashimi 'cos they're so expensive
I ordered the Sashimi Lunch Box ($15) once
the portion was so small (9 tiny pieces), it didn't fill me up at all (yes, I even finished the entire bowl of rice that came with my order)
But I saw most people around me ordered noodles or some sort
so I guess those would be a much better deal (average $12)
In case you're wondering, the decor is standard Japanese (all wood)
What the Japanese are lining up for, esp on fridays is not on the menu
It's pork ramen
It amazing and that's what the fuss is about
Of course the sushi is very fresh as well
lunch at this place is delicious and pretty cheap
I love their eel specialty and yummy lunch boxes
Lunch is much more affordable at this place than dinner
Friday Soba noodles are worth the trip for a great lunch (under $15)
Careful
I found this place by walking by and seeing a line of japanese people waiting outside in a line at 12:30 for the forementioned noodles
It can get crowded then
For four $ signs I expected high quality, creative, tasty food
Lunch was rather bland, soup of the day was oversalted, salad had canned roasted peppers and overly oily eggplant (in fact, everything we ordered had too much oil)
Salmon was ok, however, sides were very simple and looked microwaved
Portions were huge and the food was just ok - definitely overrated w its 9 rating
You can get much better food at the same price at other restaurants
Wandered it because it started raining and we were hungry, turned out to be fantastic food and tiarimisu! I can eat pasta anywhere but this was really good, and the decor was fun and cozy and we didn't feel underdressed in jeans and sweatshirts

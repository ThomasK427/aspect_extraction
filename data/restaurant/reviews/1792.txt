I've had a lot better at cheaper prices
Upon leaving the restaurant, the host had the nerve to follow us outside the restaurant and accuse us of lying, saying that we had called to cancel the reservation when we hadn't
Very disgusted with the host's behavior, he should be fired
He's bald and has big fish eyes, in case anyone is curious what he looks like
Don't bother going there, do yourself a favor
batali is definitely a creative and an amazing Iron Chef
The black spaghetti, the lamb tongue, and the lamb chops are must tries!!!!! I will definitely go back for another round of amazing food
Excellent service and friendly staffs by the way
I'm not sure why the maitre d' had such an attitude, especially since we were kept waiting for an hour past our reservation time
The dishes on the menu sounded amazing, but the food itself was unbelievably salty
They also cleared our table before we got our second dish, and we had to remind the waiter of it
I think Batali's other restaurant Lupa is much, much better
Went for 1st anniversary w/girlfriend, couldn't have been better
Service was the best I've ever experienced, and the food was outstanding! Lamb's tongue vinaigrette and beef cheek ravioli were two of the most flavorful dishes I've ever eaten, and, for that type of food, the prices could be a lot worse
She had the mint love letters, which were also great
We were seated promptly, never rushed, and our waiter answered every question we had before we even asked them
Overall, the best dining experience I've had
Set aside some time for this venture (or adventure) because we waited an hour for our table even with reservations (!) but ultimately were thrilled
Fantastic food, complex and rich
I think I shall never forget the fois grois ravioli with balsamic sauce
Had dinner there last night and was very disappointed
We chose the regular tasting menu with the wine pairing option
After the first and second courses and their accompanying wines were served, our waiter disappeared
We didn't see him the rest of the night, the other courses come out sporadically, and no one ever asked if we wanted more wine (which we did) or refilled our water -- even after we flagged down another waiter, nothing happened
We eat out all the time at upscale NY restaurants and this was the worst service we've experienced in years
To top it off the food was very mediocre, with the exception of the famed beef cheek ravioli which we had substituted for one of the courses
Maybe it was just an off night, but I doubt we will return
Want to go to a place and have a we prepared Italian cuisine? This is one of the places you could try
I was so stuffed by dessert time, I had no room, but I made room anyway
I recommend it for that outting where you want to make a friend or family feel warm and to share some good stories
This place is warm enough and the food is good enough
930 reservations, 30min wait, treated with Bellinis to compensate
We craved a Brunello, so sommelier recommended a lovely $75 bottle
Smooth, lacking in personality but, overall, quite a nice wine which I could drink bottle after bottle of
Octopus appetizer was lovely, cooked perfectly, interesting citrus flavors to enhance charcoal flavors
Beef Cheek Ravioli was SUPERB! Flavorful filling, slivers of black truffles -- perfect balance of flavor, texture luxury
I'd order this every time! Sweetbreads were done well
Lamb Loin, off tasting menu, was HUGE dissappointment -- 2 oz of seared, bland meat on a boring eggplant puree
It was a tasting portion at entree price ($29!!)
We saw other entrees going by our table and they were 5x the size! Service was EXCELLENT
Had we been served an entree-sized entree, it would have been a perfect evening
I'll be back just for the pastas, avoiding all other courses
Was recommended their classic tasting meny with wines
First out a cured salmon wich was quite poor and not italian at all
Then onto two fantastic pasta dishes (world class) especially the Papardelle
After that two mainstream main coarses good but not spectacular and hardly any italian about them
They then finished off our table with 4 !! different desserts
2 fantastic ones and 2 below average
All in all a night with mixed impressions
Service just perfect as were the wine choices
But som of the dishes on the menu were just not up to the stantard
Should have been more italian and really dont do justice to their brilliant chefs
A tip just go a la carte
overly casual service and painfully average food, despite the creativity of the menu
definitely a tourist trap filled with people enamored more with the fact that they are ACTUALLY at Mario's rather than seriously considering the banality of the food and service
Don't waste your time or money
I was hesitant to go because of the negative reviews
My friend and I decided to sample the Traditional Tasting Menu with the wine pairing
Folks
you cannot miss on this! The 7 courses were the most sumptious Ive had in ages
Being a native NYer and having grown up with food as a focal point in my life, this is a grastonomic adventure you simply must experience!  Dissmiss the negative reviews, ignore the obnoxious people from LA at the next table celebrating their anniversary and turn your phones off
get out and enjoy this masterpiece
THANK YOU MARIO
this is truely one of NYs finest!
This is what a dining experience should be
The food was extraordinary, the ambience warm and relaxed, and the service terrific
The pasta tasting menu served up the most delicate, sumptuous array of pastas (and the accompanying wines complimented them perfectly)
Finally, after many disappointing and costly dining experiences at other restaurants (i
e
Cipriani) here is gourmet Italian that is worth the price
Great food, a wine list from heaven, great staff, and a warm atmosphere make a Babbo an inviting and refreshing place
Pricey, but worth the extra
once you get in, you are all set
However, getting a reservation to this place is very difficulrt if you are not famous or a friend of the owners
It is very frustrating!!! But the food is fabulous and the waiters are quite lovely
It's just getting a reservation that turns me off! you call and call and call and then
you find out that you can only get in at 5:30 PM on the day you want
Sigh
Babbo is as good as it gets in New York dining
The food is absolutely sublime
Plenty of choices on the menu, ranging from simple pasta dishes like Papardelle with Bolognese sauce, to more complex plates like Ravioli with beef cheek and grilled quail
The service is equally wonderful
The wait staff is always prompt and attentive, and everyone there is highly knowledgeable of the food
The sommelier is superb: extremely knowledgeable and in no way pushy about trying to get you to order expensive wines
The only negative is the fact that there is loud, 80's rock music playing fairly loudly
In a restaurant of this caliber, there really should be no music
Overall, Babbo is easily the best Italian restaurant in the city and quite possibly the best overall restaurant as well
I went to celebrate my 40th birthday at Babbo this past weekend
Let me firstly if you want the same old tired red sauce Italian, then you will be surely disappointed
You will be better served at Carmine's in Times Square
Our waiter Adam was excellent
Not only was he professional and considerate without being stuffy, but he had a wealth of information and everything that he recommended was plainly devine
It was his suggestion that we take only a half portion of the fabulous Goose Liver Ravioli because it may be too rich since we were having meaty entries
Again, Adam was right on the money
With it's many innovating and delicious dishes and a staff that is truly professional, knowlegable and yet friendly, Babbo is truly a dining experience that lives up to the hype
As habitues of New Yorks finest restaurants, do we not tire, alas, of the once-exciting: the now endless stiff-parade of New-American, creatively vaguely Asian-influenced French-based, Nouvelle-cuisine plated dusted mains, the deadly clich of the molten chocolate souffle cake
To disenchanted fellow foodies, I say: reawaken your faith! Babbo restores the surprise and excitement so often dearly missing elsewhere today
Chef Batali delivers on his celebrity
Menu is filled with unfamiliar dishes, many sublime: satisfying, clearly-flavored, intelligently-conceived and nearly flawlessly-executed dishes, some (Tortellini in Brodo) rising to the level of epiphany: to be long-remembered
In all, one of the best tastings in years

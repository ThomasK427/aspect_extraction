Will definitely go back
I went to Sushi Samba on Park and was very happy with the food and service
The space is small and reservations are definitly needed
We found ourselves very cramped and could not get into or out of our seats with out bumping into uor neighbors and sucking our bellies in
I think the place is definitly worth while if you like places that are in the scene and trendy, but if you just want quality sushi many other places might come to mind
Overall I recommend this place for couples and those looking to go out to a nice club afterwards
I had been wanting to check out this restaurant ever since it opened
When I finally did, I was quite disappointed
I've been to many sushi places and although their menu was very creative and the ideas were all about thinking 'outside the box', the food itself was nothing special
Some of what I ordered was hard to eat, as things were piled one on top of the other
The service was too fast- the second we finished one course, they shoved the next one in front of us, as if to get us out the door
I enjoyed the atmosphere, but that's not enough reason for this place to be so successful
The food and cocktails at SushiSamba were very good; however the seating is so tight and uncomfortable and the service so rushed that I will probably never go back
I use to go to Sushi Samba on Park ave S
almost every month
I havent been there in almost a year since I moved
I went back about a week ago and was terribly disappointed
They stuck in about 5 more tables into the restaurant, the only way for my date to get up was for the busboys to pull out the table, everyone around us was saying the same thing ( why are the tables so packed in, this is ridiculous)
The food was no better then average, and the waitress rushed us through our meal in less then an hour ( drinks, appetizer, entree, desert)
I have never had such an unpleasant experience at what WAS one of my favorite restaurants
I would rather go to Asia De Cuba or Tao, they are much nicer, costs the same and it blows Sushi Samba away in every respect
I had reservation at 7p for 6 ppl
1 of my friends was late for 10 mins, the host wasnt allowed us to get the table until the whole party was there
It's the stupidest thing to have 5 of us waiting at the tiny bar with people pushing around while our table was empty and ready!   Not recommended for group with more than 4 people
6 of us got jammed into a 4-person table!   However, food is great, but order was missing the bill didnt come out right
I had my coat a shopping bag checked, but the girl only gave me back the coat
The staffs are very unprofessional rude
I do expect more from a 9
1-rated restaurant
They really need to streamline their management and customer services!
The restaurant tried to be trendy
The serivce is bad
Everyone there has an attitude
The food is not great
They put too much sauce, which covers the freshness of the fish
Totally overated! We made a reservation for 6
We had 5 people arrived, they still didn't want to give us the table even though the table was empty there
They put us in a 4 people table
Paying for that price, I could have gone a lot of better places
I definitely wouldn't go there again!
bad service, not great food, terrible atmosphere, tables on top of each other, rude hostesses
need I say more? Why bother? this place is such a disappointment!
The Park Ave Sushi Samba is such a cool restaurant
It's always packed
And the food is ALWAYS good
The TUNA PIZZA SPECIAL with jalapeo sauce is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I can't get enough of it
I love this place
I've been here a few times and definitely enjoy this location better than the village location
First off, this place has an amzing drink list
Their mojitos are perfect and their apple martinis are the best I've had
The yellowtail cerviche is unbelievable and every roll I've ever had here is exceptionally good
I will definitely keep coming back!
beware of BT! the sushi is so-so, the 70s orange-themed atmosphere is 2000ish, and there is no reason for the staff's attitude
maybe impressive for out-of-towners, but locals should go elsewhere
My wife and I go to the 7th Ave
restaurant quite often
We start with the Caipirinha's because it takes a while to get seated, but after one or two of these great drinks with the great latin music playing we don't mind the wait for a table
It's also fun to sit at the sushi bar
We usually go for the Brazilian food
Try the Moqueca Mista and the Snapper
We haven't been to the Park Avenue restaurant but we did go to the Miami Beach location on Lincoln Avenue and it was pretty darn good also
I was at Sushi Samba Chicago and had to see if NYC SUSHI SAMBA lived up to its younger sister
It did! The sushi was great and the drinks were strong and tropical
You must catch the vibe and enjoy
I recommend it!!!!!
Good food, but small portions and it's by no means cheap
I just got back from a great meal at sushi samba
The service was great, even though it was really crowded but thats a good thing, i had the special mango martini, and the special banana dessert, everything was delicious, would definately go back
We spent over $400 on saki, sashimi and not much else
While the sashimi was above average, it certainly did not justify the price
Will have to reserve judgement until another visit
japanese and brazilian!? who's the genius who came up with this? Our waitress was so pretty and sweet, I wanted to be her
I had the chilean seabass
SOO GOOD
and the mango drinks were great, the calamari just rightly spiced, everything was great! It started getting packed right after we got there so go early
DON'T GET PARK CONFUSED WITH 7!!!! I thought I'd try 7 because it was much closer and would be the same as Park
but NOOOOO 7 was such a DISAPPOINTMENT
the chef there cooks totally differently and the dishes are SO BAD
Sushi Samba is small but cute and trendy
The food and drinks are incredibly unique and tasty
Everything is so good that you cant help but find yourself going overboard
Although it is a tad pricey, it is well worth it!
Great mojitos, nice and strong
Impressed with the fusion of latin and japanese cusine
Stick with the sushi and creative ceviches
The cooked entrees were okay, but not memorable- the sea bass was decent but too pricey for the small portion
Fun atmosphere with great latin music in the background
For a more traditional experience, go to Yama or Mizu, both around the corner
Very fun place
Good food that is fun and interesting to eat- its like every dish is a brand new toy to play with
Also a lot of beautiful people, so good eye candy too
Last night I went here with 2 girl friends - this particular sushi samba is alot smaller than the other one
We had a wonderful time! The food was excellent and very reasonably priced
The drinks were creative and although expensive - they were delicious and strong - ha ha we may have had one too many! The restaurant had a fun buzz that made you feel like part of the scene
The bartender was fun and knew his drinks and our waiter was perfect
The only thing that was a little annoying was that the hostess didnt want to let us finish our first drinks at the bar and kept rushing us to sit down
One particular thing on the menu stood out and that was the 'el toro' it was sooo good and that was where I really saw brazilian meet japanese - dont pass it up!
This restaurant is for kids
It thinks that its menu is serious, yet again, its more CONFUSION than japanese and brazilian fusion
this seems to be a trend for the past few years

They have ,like a ten foot projection tv at the bar
what a way to watch a game while drinking swankaritas,,,the bartender was lots of fun
and although she was a a giant fan and we were watching the jets,,
it was still fun
i had a Swanky buritto
and it was really good and boy was it huge,
its like swanky had an inside tip on a famine
lol
I'm looking forward to going back again and trying to covert that bartender
to a jets fan
As a tour operator for groups from Europe, I am looking for a good Mexican restaurant - but this is not it
The decor is a tacky stereotype, the food is mediocre (neither authentic nor imaginative)
The service was unforgiveable
The waitress didn't seem to know what to do when we asked her to take our order
It was a slow night and we still waited for 20 minutes
The music was loud rock which they would not turn down
There was a game on TV which they forced us to view
Additional drinks/dessert was never offered and we never saw the waitress again
A different waiter brought us the check
I wouldn't set foot in Senior Swanky's if it was the last restaurant in New York City!
Ihave been going to Senor swanky's for ovweer 10 years
and although i loved the dive bar on 74th st
this transfomation is unbelievable
this plcae is beautifull its clean its sexy sultry and amazing the priave lounge in the back is amazing
the oiudoor cafe is huge and the veiws are fun and entertaining
the food was grerat
order the Steak Fajitas
and the mango swankaritas are great on a hot summer day
im glad they moved up in status and just up the block
now i love to bring my dates in there
the place is real nice
my mom would even like it and she is one tough cookie
lol
plus i was there on a thursday night and they have live music
with no cover bonus
yeah!!!!!!
Since moving uptown from their former dive at 74th Street, Senor Swanky's has undergone an unfortunate transformation
What was my favorite Mexican restaurant has, in their effort to become respectable, lost all of its former charm and appeal
Cleaning up one's act doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice service and food quality! In order to mesh with their very atteractive new location, the menu, while the same, has undergone an upsetting change to the mainstream
Their Jalapeno Bombs are now about as exciting as a grocery store frozen product
Their formerly great Mexican Burrito, while still listed identically on the menu, has become insipid
In addition guys, please hire some waitstaff who know both English and your menu
A recent trip has shattered all my pleasant past experiences
If your new image is what you planned to achieve, change your name so you won't dissapoint your former patrons!
We celebrated my cousin's 24th birthday at this cozy little restaurant last night and everyone enjoyed the meal -- from appetizers (recommend the spicy lemon shrimp) to the last bite of our guinness dark chocolate cake!  This is my second time there, and it was just as enjoyable as the first
I had the crumb steak with stuffed procuitto and fontina, excellent
my cousin had the wild stripe bass in banana leaf, EXCELLENT! everything on the menu sounded different and exciting, not your everyday type of dishes
the wine selection was limited but the sauvignon was nice
the carafe of sangria was very fruity but not too sweet, highly recommended
the only drawback is the temperature
it is always a bit on the warm side in there
but with fall/winter approaching it shouldnt be an issue
In an area that is becoming more hi strung by the week, it is totally great to have a place where tasty and unpretentious food can be found
With zero-attitude service, relaxed decor, and friendly attitude, this sliver of a restaurant is find by anyone's measure
Time will tell if it becomes a local fave
I was seated in the picnic table in the back
quieter, but no less attended than the front/bar area
The staff was knowledgable about the affordable wine list and my waitress described the daily specials in a way that had me drooling
I had a special, which believe was sopresata, covered with cheese,red onions and spices all fried in a tiny hotpan
delish
My dorade plate was very well prepared, but I'm a carb-freak and found myself drooling at my dining mates' lasagna-based dish, and the risotto variants
I'll definitely be returning
Not only is the decor inviting and the staff knowledgeable of the menu/nice to look at, but the food holds up to the staff's boasting description and the laid back atmosphere
It seem purely Brazilian at first--with a shrine to Pele--but this is Brazilian outside of the box, with its Indian and Italian influence: creative curry dishes, bolognese, wild bass with bananas, tasty appetizers (fresh crab, baked provoleta in an iron skillet, and a bruschetta that's overflowing with heirloom tomatoes), not to mention a drink menu that successfully pulls off sakerinhas, quenching sparkling peach mojitos, assorted beer options, and a fantastic selection of wines (tempranillo and verdejo by the glass, along with other less complex options)
This place is definitely going to give Cafe Havana a run for their money
Ever feel hungry after a long night out on the town? Dopey Benny's is your quick fix on the LES
They offer various beef, chicken sandwiches on 4 rolls and excellent cheese fries
Best of all, they're open late
It'll beat that greasespoon diner open late any day
My boyfriend Alex I went there after seeing Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith to try their Grand Opening Special, which includes 3 mini cheesesteaks, flavoured fries and a drink, all for only $8
Now thats a fantastic value in NYC! They have variations on the common traditional cheesesteak so I tried them with chicken, 1 Mexican style (with salsa and guac) and 2 Korean style (ginger, garlic sesame)
Their sour cream onion fries are wonderful it comes with free chipotle mayo
YUM! It's next to The White Rabbit, which is one of the best laid back lounges in Downtown Manhattan
Met friends on a weekday for dinner and everyone agreed that the management has nailed good ambiance and presentation of dishes
Everything that was placed in front of us was plated creatively and looked amazing
Taste wise, we agreed the cuisine was average
Three of us had three different fish dishes
all were decent, but each a little on the sweet side even though I specified spicy
The other of the group had vegetarian green curry (which was presented in a whole young coconut!) that was average
Price wise, no dish was over $20 (most were $19)
With one drink each, apps, entrees, and three desserts (nothing great) the bill came to $200 for four
All in all, a nice place to try out but not a staple to continue returning to
Prem On is a favorite Thai spot of mine
While not as cheap as other Thai joints in the neighborhood, you will definetely spend on average $20-$25 for a great Thai meal if you choose to go other than noodles
Just recently, brought a bunch of friends there and everyone raved above their entrees
From the soft shell crab and my favorite, pad thai with scallop, everyone was very pleased with presentation, taste, and portion size
If you want to go out for a nicer than average Thai meal, I would recommend Prem On!
Above avergae Thai for New York which is notoriously deficient in this cuisine
All the dishes we had were well-exectued if not particularly unique or memorable
Service was amateruish but not so painfully slwo as described--likely because we went on a Sunday
Be careful if it's a cold or windy night--when they throw the back doors open it creates a wind tunnel through the space
Tom Yum Gang was served so hot it was boiling and the mortar it came in couldhave easily burned one if touched
Fried sea bass was excellent
Niceties like using yellow and orange peppers in dishes rather than just red and/or green were notable
While the food is good, the service is terrible
We sat down and ordered by 8, the food came at 10PM!! My bf and I were STARVING!! The waitress's excuse: the kitchen is busy
How busy and unorganized can it really be!? Was there only like 'one' person in the kitchen or something? I doubt it
Other tables around us were complaining as well
It was my first time trying Thai food here in NYC
I was recommended by a friend to try Prem-on

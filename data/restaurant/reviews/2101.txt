The food is typical bar food
Not bad but don't expect anything from a 5 star menu
Never go with more than 4 people to sit outside! the seats just aren't flexible
The staff turns angry if you ask about adding a chair or even standing next to the table
Maybe it had more charm back in the day, but the only reason I can come up with for why Dylan Thomas chose to drink himself into oblivion at this place is that he was too drunk to drag himself someplace better
The beer is fine, but the food is mediocre, and you may well have time to drink yourself to death before you get a table on a summer night
Dylan Thomas drank himself to death here and it's not hard to see why
With its picnic benches and gloomy interior, the White Horse begs for the visual enhancement provided by a good stiff drink
Maybe if the Welsh poet had sobered up, he would have paid more attention to the delicious burgers and jalapeno poppers, not just the endless pints of beer--served by an efficient crew
In his wake, the back room has been spruced up somewhat by various portraits of the man who gave us Under Milk Wood, Adventures in the Skin Trade and A Child's Christmas in Wales
Aspiring poets would do well to avoid the weekend crowds
Friday and Saturday nights, no one wants to hear your slurred free verse
White Horse is far and awy the best option in the neighborhood for a quick brew an dburger--far better than the overhyped, overcrowded Corner Bistro
Cheap suds and good grub -- and yeah, there's that Dylan Thomas cachet for those who need a literary justification for satisfying their baser appetites
In Short Before the Meatpacking District was uber-cool, this retro diner was a destination for its better-than-it-needs-to-be food and its laid-back but hip scene
The menu includes steak frites, onion soup and black sausage, killer salads and more traditional coffee-shop favorites
Breakfast is served anytime, the prix-fixe brunch is a good bargain and includes a bloody mary or mimosa, and the coffee is strong
This restaurant provided perhaps the worst service I have ever received
By this I mean that the guy selling hotdogs outside of Grand Central has given me better service
The waitress was no where to be found at all throughout the course of the meal, did not refill a single drink nor did she bother to inquire about my satisfaction with the food or even bring the check at the conclusion of the meal
The remaining staff were MIA as well throughout the hour and a half spent at Florent
To top off the terrible service which was not much worse than the food itself, the waitress added an 18% gratuity to the bill which I refused to pay
At this the host was infuriated as well as the remaining staff
I cannot understand how it is that this place stays in business at all
This place belongs at the bottom of the list for places to eat in the Meatpacking
The interior of this place looks like an abandoned diner that was not remodeled when it converted to French fare
Lighting is fluorescent and not amenable to a romantic dinner
Tables are so crowded together that people have to stand up to let passers by get to get to the bathroom
My goat cheese salad looked like a disaster and it was only slightly better than it looked
Our waiter, while nice, was MIA most of the time
Will not be back
Over rated, with horrible service
The host was nice, and friendly
Our waiter started off great, and after taking our order, we never saw him again
He was too busy hanging out at the bar trying to pick up on a customer and made his rounds giving kisses to the rest of the crowd
Our bus boy cleared our table, and offered us desert and did more than our waiter did
We literally had to hunt our waiter down just to get our bill
We again waited five more minutes while he said his goodbyes
The food was average and not worthy of the hype the other reviews suggest
Save your time, and money, and go some where else!   However, if you enjoy sitting long periods between courses, and have patience, this might be the place for you!
I had my birthday party here years ago and recently found that it's still funky, fun with fabulous food and a great crowd
They also throw a great Bastille Day party! It is amazing how long Florent has survived
but it's good to know that it has and has survived intact! One of the best 'late night-light food' places in the club zone
This is one of those only in NYC type places
Where else can you get authentic and excellently prepared French bistro food along side standard American diner fare? The dark lighting and electronica soundtrack add the chic vibe to the dining experience at Florent
But dining at Florent should not be reserved for hunger pains at 3am only
This is top notch food worthy of a visit at any time of the day
The daily price fixe options are an excellent bargain
Portions are large and prices reasonable which makes Florent such an excellent value choice
Forget the velvet ropes and door people with attitude
Go to Florent! This diner (I use this term strictly for the decor) is full of happy, interesting people from the staff to the patrons
It's more like a party than a dinner
The veggie burger is the best in the city and their fries are to die for
Thank God the Meat Packing District still has this original landmark!
Florent has the best mussels in town, you can order the usual Moules Frites in a white wine garlic sauce or the mussels with a daily special sauce
L'onion soupe is amazing and the cheese is awesome!!! The frites are super tasty
Always crowded, I strongly recommend you to make reservations
The ambience is loud, with tight tables, and a diner feel to it
Great place to hang out at all hours
I love this place!
Maybe it's because I actually went to Florent for dinner, before I was completley wasted - but I was completley unsatisfied with my meal
The restaurant is unbearably crowded and they seat everyone so close together it's almost impossible to get up when you want to leave / go to the bathroom, whatever
Although the frites are excellent, I wouldn't reccommend the chicken
I had the chicken stuffed with wild mushrooms, spinach and cheese and it was dry, bland and tasteless
The mashed potatos tasted like instant whipped potatoes
The only good part of the meal was the green beans, which were incredibly fresh and buttery
The service, however, was excellent
This is probably one of the best french bistros in the city
The onion soup is very tasty and the mussels are a steal for only $12
The waiters were very friendly and the ambience was very lively
I'd definetly recommend this place to all french lovers that are looking for a simple place to dine and enjoy good food
What a treat! I went to Florent for the first time last night and it was absolutely delicous! From the french fries to the grill chicken sandwich, oh and the mussels were suberb
The place was packed but we only had to wait for 5 minutes for a table
Florent is an institution - it should be a landmark for all New Yorkers who long for the old New York (60s, 70s) - - - it was cool before the Meatpacking district became trendy
Great place to relax and dine with a group of friends, by yourself or with your partner
Very special place
after closing out the clubs on a Saturday night, at 5am this place is JUMPING
full of people having anything from burgers to escargot
order quick because the food can take a while, but it is oh so satisfying when it comes
This is a great place to grab a bite, in the wee hours of a NYC night
There is an ever-present but not overly intrusive disco beat/music in the background and the crowd tends to fill, past 11pm on
The food is only ok - it's a French menu, American diner quality
But the warm mussels soaking in garlic broth (or whatever the special broth of the night happens to be), is simply wonderful
best eaten at 1am, when you're tired but not quite ready to retire
:)
I absolutley LOVE florent
The mean I always get is the mussels,(cheap and enough for 2-4 people!), the bean and sausage soup, and you must dip your bread in it, unbelievable, the hanger steak with fries or mashed potatoes with the port wine and mustard sauce on the side
The mustard sauce makes the whole meal for me! My best friend loves the coffee, I don't drink coffee but he raves about it
Check it out you won't reget it!
great burgers and crab cake sandwiches, and open 24 hrs on the weekends! it can take a while to get your food, (or even to order) but with the eye-candy all around, the time passes quickly
Florent has a nice menu, with some good choices
Service is efficient and friendly
Prices are reasonable
It will be crowded at peak times, like most places that are worth the trip
the best diner in the city! (or at least most unique
) wheras most diners have a decidedly greek tone, this place is FRENCH
good things: burgers, crab cake sandwiches, eggs benedict, fries
escargot could use a bit more garlic (i think i will ask next time i order them
) late night crowd is wonderful eye-candy, but the place started closing at 2am the last couple of years, except for fri + saturday--when they still seem to stay open all night
service is notoroiuosly slow

Loved every minute of it! Ordered the Omakase menu, each course was an amazing journey through Morimoto's talents! The service was impeccable! The staff was extremely friendly and kind! The decor is extremely unique and very visually appealing
Its own style
I loved every minute of my experience at Morimoto and would reccomend it to anyone!
I went to Morimoto and found the place beautiful and the service very customer oriented
But for me it's all about the food
Sat at the sushi bar and ordered the omakase
You don't have to be at the omakase bar to have this chef tasting menu
9 wonderful courses - 3 prepared by Chef Morimoto himself
My favorite? A soup with both fresh monkfish and monkfish liver pate - it was superb
I loved it
I went to the opening and loved Morimoto
The space is beautiful and airy
The service was attentive, the sushi was fresh
But I only had raw bar/sushi
I returned a few days ago curious to see why all my friends were complaining
The cooked food was simply horrible
The rock shrimp was dripping with grease
The calamari salad was bland
The blackened cod was chewy and soaked in too much sauce
The sushi was still good - but not great
We didn't finish any of the cooked entrees
When the waitress asked what we thought, we were honest and told her it was disappointing
She just shrugged; clearly it wasn't the first time she'd heard this comment
For these prices, Morimoto should be great all around
The space may be gorgeous but sadly, the restaurant doesn't live up to its expectations
Did the $120 omakase
Very fresh sushi / oyster, but there isn't a signature dish that I am impress with
I was quite disappointed actually, there is no wow factor in any of the dishes
Sushi is good, but I had something better, cheaper at Sushi Gari or even Poke
The egg custard is special, but Donguri did it better
Sake list is just OK, a lot of Morimoto brand, which nobody knows what they're
Bar downstairs had sketchy service
Decor is very 80s, fake concrete look, plasticky
Why all the buzz
Tao / EN spaces are more impressive
And that seems to be the theme the whole nite
Just think the restaurant hurts itself with all the hype
In this town, you just can't survive with just the fluff and no stuff
Try it once, and it's enough
If you like sushi or not, don't miss this newcomer
I've been in 2x, once for food and once just for drinks
I'm a regular at the Philly location so I am a bit of a morimoto 'groupie'
NYC's food is different but refreshingly so
You can't get sushi any better than here and the food from the kitchen is great
Don't miss the 'White Lily' possibly one of the best cocktails I have ever had!
Having already frequented Morimoto's EXCELLENT Philly restaurant my girlfriend and I were hoping for the same salubrious fair surrounded by similarly plush interior design only to find that Morimoto's New York establishment was way overrated
With diners attempting to be the in-crowd, the food was mildly mediocre, and the price was exhorbitant
There is also definitely some biased service when you're not related to someone who works there or you're not a close friend of Morimoto's
I won't be going there again
I was really excited to eat at the famed iron chef's new place, especially hearing such high praise about the establishment in philly
Walking in, I wasn't taken back at all by the space or the decor
The design was on point but the materials they used were lacking
The center piece is a wall of water bottles
The seats in the lounge are foam from a McDonald's playground
The rest of it is probably from IKEA
Maybe this is temporary? The fish itself was inconsistent and several items from the menu were MIA
Although the menu offers many things that sound spectacular, the wow factor failed when the food arrived
The price was reasonable but questionable as to being worth it
If Morimoto is to last it needs to step up its game
Besides meeting Morimoto, this is truly an Iron Chef experience
The 9 course tasting menu was a perfect balance of taste and art
The service was excellent and the quality of food was top notch
If you are a true fan of food this is the place to go
With the food, the specialty drinks and the occasional celeb at the next table, you will leave very satisfied!
We were so excited to try this place only to be disappointed by small portions and crazy expensive prices
The waiters did not know what they were serving us half the time
We did the recommended tasting menu
It ended up costing $250 a head (including 3 drinks)
The dessert was tasteless and unimpressive
I was expecting a wow factor and it just wasn't there
As a big Iron Chef fan, I definitely had to try Morimoto! We had the morimoto omakase (9 course tasting menu)
It was delicious! I'm not big on eating raw food but after eating at Nobu and surviving, I thought why not
It was great
Everything was really fresh and the flavors were stunning
Each dish was beautifully arranged
During our meal, we got a chance to meet Morimoto himself and he later sent over a complimentary sashimi pizza! Since the restaurant is new, the wait staff seemed a little unsure of themselves and the dishes they were serving but they were very attentive to all our needs
Also, make sure to check out the bathroom and the lounge downstairs!
Cool to see Morimoto being hands on and not just one of those celebrity chefs
The service was mediocre at best
After Mr
Starr's interview in the paper a few weeks ago, I expected above average service
The place looks good, but having been to a few of Mr
Starr's restaurants in Philadelphia, I'm not surprised by the decor
However, I felt similar after my experiences in Philadelphia, Mr
Starr seems to put form before function and the service was rather uninformed and cold (although attractive)
I will probably try Morimoto later in the year, after the dust settles
but there is much dust
I hear a Buddakan is next, if you've ever been to the one in Philadelphia you will agree with me that the service is too pretentious and I will not be giving that one a try
Mr
Starr has done good things, however this needs some work
I was very dissapointed last night when I ate at Morimoto's in NY
I've been to the one in Philly and it totally knocked my socks off it was so good
My date and I had the omakase and also ordered the tempura, king crab legs, and ramen off the menu
First of all the first two dishes in the omakase tasted like it was prepared earlier in the day and was just waiting to be served
The raw dishes didn't taste fresh
The king crab legs tasted like the crab legs they serve at the buffets! Our wagyu beef and cod fish were chewy
The ramen noodles had a layer of oil floating on top
I was amazed that the tempura was hot
All the flavors were not balanced
And to end the night they served us a chocolate cheesecake that tasted like a betty crocker brownie!

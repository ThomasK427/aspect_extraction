The food was great
I absolutely hate communal seating and closely spaced tables and this place had both, but the atmosphere and the food were such that I was able to get beyond the grumpy mood that put me in to have a really good experience
I would even go back and sit among a crowd of strangers
I had the leg of lamb sandwich (cold) and my wife had the merguez sandwich (warm)
They were both excellent
The pitas are oven baked fresh
Absolutely delicious!
well priced but so mediocre- and smelly-too smoky in there
I've been there twice, and it was great both times
Cheap hummus, bread, pizza-type things, all absolutely delicious
the food was wonderful, the hummus, soo creamy
I was there on a Tuesday night, not crowded at all, and we were not rushed to finish
the waiter was friendly and very helpful making suggestions for a group of three to share
I will be dining there again! the place is small, and they only take cash, so I recommend smaller groups of people
Don't ever let this great place lose it's West Village charm
Amazing food, great little locale
Yummy!
Great quality middle eastern food regardless of the absurdly low prices
I come here all the time and EVERYTHING on the menu is excellent
Personal favorites: spinach cheese pie, hummus, babaganoush (true smoked eggplant), spinach chickpea salad, Moustache pitza
Beward of crazy long waits and crowds during the busy hours
Get there before or after
Every single person I have taken there since I have found this cute place, liked it! Food, atmosphere, price and location are worth waiting outside in the cold to be seated
I simply love it
This place is simply marvelous - the Pitzas (pun intended) are scrumptious - green pitza and chicken pitzas are two of my personal favorites
the salads are also quite tasty indeed - the lentil bulgar salad with fried onions absolutely top notch
the atmosphere is pleasant enough - the waitstaff can vary as far as friendliness is concerned but Terek is a real doll
The food's great -- the salad, particularly, is very refreshing in the summer
But yes, there's almost bound to be a wait -- if you want to eat, chances are 200 other people in the immediate vicinity do, too
Your best bet is to go early, before you're starved and just enjoy the hanging-around time -- because you're not going to speed the process up by stressing
The Scene Intimate, candlelit Tartine serves creative French bistro fare in an unpretentious, if inexplicably lighthouse-themed, environment
Couples bearing fine wine and microbrewed beer in brown paper bags brave snow, sleet and sweltering heat to line up in front of this diminutive B

West Village gem, especially for brunch
The Food The hearty French menu is executed with smart, flavorful touches
French onion soup, for example, arrives cooked in a flaky potpie crust, while grilled herb-encrusted salmon comes with a garnish of capers, scallions, chopped tomatoes and grapefruit wedges
The brunch menu is particularly strong; the enormous apple pancakes are a favorite
For dessert, try the rich, deliciously sweet tarte Tatin, served with homemade ice cream
I've been to Tartine a few times for brunch, and my last visit will be my last visit ever
The potatoes had been sitting out for probably a few hours, and were rock hard, covered in cold oil
I've eaten unidentified meat at roadside stalls in China, so I can't really describe myself as an overly demanding critic
The waiter was rude and disinterested, and all the patrons at the table next to us had to get up and shuffle out the door (literally), in order for there to be room for us to move out of our seats
Did I mention the food was terrible? That should theoretically be the selling point
And at 13
95, not even remotely a brunch deal
Please don't patronize this lazy establishment
When they say NYC restaurants are small, they weren't kidding with Tartine
You are sure to bump into someone's table when getting to your seat
Because of the size, there is sure to be a wait list when dining here
Unfortunately, they don't use wait lists, possibly because the staff size is limited
So, you are courteously directed to wait outside
There is an immediate sense of uncertainty b/c there are no lines nor organization
The Apple Pancakes are great and definitely are worth the selection
The reason to go is simple, value-priced good eats with great desserts where you can bring your own great wines with no corkage fees
Tiny and gets packed, so go early or wait
What kind of restaurant owner makes their curstomers wait outside in a line unless they really think very little of you
? With so many better restaurants in the area, this place is not worth the wait, the bad service, cramped tables, mediocre food, and the cash only policy
Don't bother with the pork, it's over cooked, dry, and tasteless
I've been to Tartine twice now
So by no means am I a regular
But there are two simple things about this place
The food is GREAT and the service is STRAIGHT FORWARD
I was rather impressed with the wait staff
They handle the space well and work with what they have
I'm guessing the people talking about not liking pretentious spots are the most pretentious people around
If you've paid, then you decide to wait out a storm, so you choose to order a coffee, you've got a problem
How about the people out waiting for a table
Hop in a cab and open the table on this jem
The only negative thing about this place is its size - it's small
Outside of that, the service is good and the food even better
Ideal place for dinner for two
This place is exasperating
There is a total disconnect between the rather good food at a reasonable price and the absolutely mindnumbing surlyness of the waitstaff
Rarely ever do you get a hello, or a thank you, and God forbid should they smile, and this is from someone who has been coming here for years
These folks need a wakeup call
Came by and my meal seemed inordinately delayed
I inquired if there was perhaps a problem and was told you can be patient or leave
WHAT!!
These folks are nuts
A simple inquiry met by such a harrangue
Sorry folks, but what you've read by others as far as the totally rude waitstaff, is in my opinion totally justified
It may not look like much from the outside but what Tartine lacks in space they make up for in food
In the winter it's cute and cozy and in the summer it's a great place to sit outside and have a bottle of wine but note it's BYOB
The sauteed chicken is my favorite but make sure to save room for dessert
The little tarts are delicious
Dinner last night was hangar steak in green pepper sauce and fries
I had no idea hangar steak could be tough but there's a first time for everything
However the french fries were fresh and perfectly done
Warning, this place is tiny with ambiance that reminded me of a diner
The real draw is the BYO policy
I have gone to tartine about a dozen times since moving to the area 6 months ago, and every experience has been great
The BYOB policy is fantastic, and the food is consistently good
The service may seem a bit laid back, but they get everything right and remember where you are in line waiting to get seated
Definitely a very special place with friends or a date
The lighthouse theme and small quarters are part of the ambiance and experience
Check it out despite the wait
Bottom Line: For Brunch, Tartine serves the best Eggs Benedict in NYC
At dinner time, they serve an herbed goat cheese salad (appetizer) which is also the best in NYC

the original candle cafe on 3rd is great too, just more casual
This is absolutely the best place to take your non-vegetarian friends who squirm at the idea of a meal without meat
The Seitan Piccata in particular, is better than veal
The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and always make excellent recommendations
Run, don't walk
This place is great from the delicious food to the friendly staff
(Especially Brian the waiter, request his section
) Candle 79 is definitely on my list of favorites!
This place is delightful! The service was fantastic, there were so many specials to choose from, and it was a very nice atmosphere
The food was great
the only thing we weren't thrilled with was the live dessert, but that's just because we like the real thing
We're only in town for 10 days, but we'll make sure to go back again before we leave
First time there - had an excellent experience
The food was amazing all around
Excellent wine
Service got off to a somewhat rocky start but it all turned out great - food cooked perfectly, no issues whatsoever
Valet parking is great too
I think the decor is just ok for a steak house of that quality, so that'd be my only small comment
I totally disagree with Raechka
I did not think that the meat was as tender as a piece of shoe
I was really impressed with the service of the staff and the freshness of everything on the menu
I have to say that their Crab cakes were amazing and the filet mignon was above average
After reading the wonderful reviews on the site about Austin's, my cousin and I took our moms there for Mother'sDay
We ordered 2tomato onion salads
The salad plate had on it 4thickly sliced tomatoes-in between lay a thickly sliced onion-not a salad, but cut tomatoes and cut onions, they were good though
When our steaks arrived, my cousin tried hers said it tastes like shoe, she couldn't eat it
My steak was okay, I soaked it in steak sauce ate it
My mom and aunt ate theirs just because they didn't want to throw away a 30 dollar steak
The bill for 4 steaks (no sides), 2 sodas and 2 salads came to $200
I have no idea who wrote these glorious reviews for this place, but we were extremely disappointed
I don't mind paying for good food, but this was disgusting a rip off
After an amazing dinner at Austins steakhouse I felt compelled to write this review and share my wonderful experience
Upon arrival the first thing I noticed was the incredible ambiance the space
Austins has managed to maintain a steakhouse feel while conveying softer bistro undertones
We started with the Austins chopped salad, which was both beautiful and delicious, and the fried calamari which was everthing it should have been (fresh, crisp and delicious)
Our steaks were thick, juicy and cooked to perfection, and Cosmo, Austins knowledgeable proprietor was able to make a fabulous wine suggestion
We had a fabulous meal which we wrapped up at the bar sipping Austins signature red apple martini (delish!) and enjoying the live music which I am told plays every Saturday night
I am a huge fan of this resturant on every level and would encourage any and all to experience it for themsalves!
Austin's atmosphere, staff and food are to die for, delicious! Beyond the steak and creamed spinich, they have a fantastic burger
You must dine at Austin's
I recently went for a dinner with ten family members, and I cannot begin to say how much we all enjoyed our experience at Austin's
We were seated promptly by the very accomodating staff
The appetizers and cocktails were all amazing
The steak was something different then anything I had tasted before, and the side dishes (creamed spinach, mac and cheese) were out of this world
After stuffing our faces on appetizers and the main course, I didn't have room for dessert
that is until I saw the dessert menu!!! I highly recommend Austin's Steakhouse for anybody looking to go out and have the best steak in Brooklyn!
Had our babies first bday party here for about 20 people
While the service was great setting up before hand, I didn't feel they when out of the way the day of the dinner
We arrived about 4:30ish (as recommended by management), the table in the center of room was fine for 12 people, the others sat in the overhang
Very hot in that area in the summer time
Before hand, the staff said that the sides were enough for 2 people
Everyone in the party didn't agree
They could have been bigger
Main meal was nice and everyone seemed to enjoy them
Staff would not change a meal to accomadidate food allegeries
I would go back for a nice dinner with my husband, but not with a bigger group
Felt very rushed as the dinner crowd was coming in
My boyfriend and I go to Austin's now on a regular basis ever since we stumbled upon it a year ago
The steaks are perfection, as are the sides! (They have outstanding creamed spinach)
The shrimp app is yummy and to top it off I have NEVER tasted a steak sauce like theirs! This place is highly recommended!!!
ONCE AGAIN AUSTIN'S IS THE REAL DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO STEAK WILL PUT IT UP AGAINST PETER LUGER'S ANY DAY OF THE WEEK, THE SERVICE WAS IMPECCABLE, HATS GO OFF TO THE CHEF STAFF MAKE YOU FEEL RIGHT AT HOME
The sat our party of four immediately even without a reservation
The steaks were delivered at perfect temperature
Wait staff was very attentive
I highly recommend this restaurant
This is a fabulous restaurant
The food was superior
They were not trying to copy any other steak house in NY
Their creamed spinach, mac and cheese and of course their steak was absolutely wonderful
What impressed me most (besides the food) was the service
They were there for our every need
We were a party of eight and we wanted for nothing
Don't be discouraged by the price
It is worth every penny
Go there for a romantic dinner for two or a family gathering
And there is even live music
Thank you for a memorable dinner

THIS STEAKHOUSE IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE BAR IS AS FANTASTIC AS THE FOOD
GREAT TIME- GREAT FOOD- GREAT SERVICE
I WILL BE THERE ONCE A WEEK
The menu was small but what there was left nothing to be desired
My meal was so incredible with a goat cheese and mango salad and pasta
I highly reccomend it
The doubles are very good
The chicken roti and veggie roti are good
The pepper is bottled, it was just hot
Roti skins are nice
In Short Opened by Duke and UNC alumni, this barbecue joint and sports bar gives nostalgic college grads a little Southern comfort, especially on game days
Diners seeking ribs, sliced-beef sandwiches, and popcorn shrimp sit at red-and-white-checked tables in the small front area, while drinkers congregate further back amid university paraphernalia and 17 TVs
Loud rock and country make conversation a challenge, but guests stuffing themselves with brisket, burgers, fried pickles and baked beans hardly seem concerned
If you need a place to go with a group go to Brother Jimmy's
We had a party of 22 people and the service and drink specias ie fish bowl and trash can were fantastic
As BBQ competitors in the NYS BBQ Championship, I can attest to the fact that Bro Jimmys; has great BBQ! Ribs, Brisket and appetizers are FANTASTIC! Run dont walk
We live right around the corner and either go in or order out at least once a week
Always a fun time with cheap drinks, good food and good music
For all the southerners
they have southern appreciation night with 25% food on Wednesdays! This Sunday even Ashley Olsen and some of her friends were there

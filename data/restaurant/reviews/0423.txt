Go directly to the seafood palace
Do not pass go, do no collect $200
The seafood palace dish rocks! Start at the top with lobster and work your way down through the many levels of clams, mussels, shrimp and even good ol' cajun crawfish (but without the ton of spice)
Decent sushi as well and a beautiful setting
Just don't during prime Times Square dining hours or your mileage on sevice will probably vary
OK
after much pleading, I joined some friends @ blue fin
I was not too excited about the overly expensive menu (even for nyc these prices are a bit high) we were only there for a little meal before the theatre so, I ordered an 11 dollar salad (easily the least expensive thing on the menu)
Well, the waiter told me that the salad is Really small, would you like me to double that? I thought, why not
well the salad came and it was even more tiny than expected even though it was a double
when the bill came he charged me 22 bucks for a couple blades of grass and 8 tiny burnt shrimp
He also forgot to bring my wine scoffed when I asked him for it 30 min into the meal
never again
Not only was the restaurant touristy but it was the worst piece of salmon I have ever eaten
Tiny, dry and took over 45 minutes to be brought to me after the appetizer was taken away, the salmon was utterly inedipble
The server didn't care and didn't offer a replacement of another dish
All 5 of the other ppl at my table agreed that this was one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time
Honestly, the worst dining experience I have had in NYC and I have lived here 31 yrs
Had Dinner on a Friday at 9pm, was a big let down
Service was horrific, food plates were never cleared until we pleaded to remove them, waited way too long for desert
Was a 3 hour dinning experience from hell
as nevr experienced in NY
I am disabled and was uncomfortable sitting so close to the traffic flow, fearing people would trip over my crutches
(it happens)
We asked to be moved and were accommodated without missing a beat
That certainly speaks well for a well organized dining establishment
Food ,service,quality and quantity were far beyond our expectations
Job well done!!!!
the blue fin is absolutely wonderful
we took the whole family before going to the theatre
The food was wonderful, service was excellent
it was child friendly and the atmosphere is elegant
I would go again and again
great addition to the restaurant scene
Truly disappointing
Went to dinner for a law firm recruiting event, and the service was abysmal
Half of our table got served appetizers, only to have them snatched away because they were meant for another table
I asked for an extra knife (they took my first away) and waited for 10 minutes while my food got cold
The halibut was flavorless, to boot
It's too bad, because this looked like a promising alternative to all the theater district schlocky eateries
We went out for a friends birthday for a party of 7
We were seated in the upstairs dining room which was simple
The food was nothing special and the price tag was hefty
The best part of the place is the W hotel bar upstairs
We did receive friendly service from the wait and bar staff
If you willing to splurge it is worth checking out
I made a reservation 3 days in advance only to wait for 1 hour and 45 minutes for a noisy table
The hosts (two with headphones that sucked out their brains) kept saying we'll seat you in a minute
They must've been imported, because I don't know what New York minute they meant
The food was mediocre at best
My Chilean Bass was served room temperature and and the sauce was drippy and bland
The sushi was mushy
All in all, you'd be better off at Olive Garden
Waitstaff was adequate, but all else cancelled them out
Great Place, Great food and Great Drinks
Fun place to hang out and people watch
Go for the four level raw castle
The raw seafood is piercingly fresh and the sauces are nice as well
The sushi is also quite tasty and fresh  I ordered the paprika coated tuna entree which was less good: while the tuna tasted fine, the paprika overwhelmed it
To sum up: cool looking place, very fresh fish, but they don't cook the fish so well
Fresh sushi, great drinks, creative menu all add up to a very hip meal, smack in the middle of Times Square! The Raw platters are overwhelming! Make sure you check out the even cooler upstairs bar
even the bathrooms are a sight, too!
I never write reviews--but this place was so bad I felt compelled
The food was tasteless and overpriced
I can't remember the last time service was this bad
It was actually downright offensive
After ordering a good amount of sushi the waiter asked me if that was all I wanted
He seemed hell bent on geting me and the others I was with to spend over $35 on food alone
After our tasteless, unimaginative dinner, we asked explicitly for the check
The waiter brought us the desert menu, and when we refused asked if we were really sure we didn't want anything
He also brought us cards to get our information
We declined to leave our info and he said well, how do you ever expect to get reservations here
Somehow I don't think I will mind
Was there for dinner last night, and the food was great
Service was a hair slow, but it was packed, and we weren't in a rush
Great atmosphere, and perfect for people watching
Overall, we were seated on time (happy about about that) and our service was great
WE were also really happy about our appetizers
however, could have done without the main meals
Both of us thought the portions were small, and the food was just not very tasty
for the money it should have been better
I ate at BlueFin during restaurant week
The service was amazing, but the sea bass was baically tasteless
The chocolate mousse was good
Pretty bar and good for people watching
While this place is beautifully designed and decorated, the food and service could use some help
It is a great place for groups because the place is huge
Don't try the lobster
True, the bread is strangely too salty
But the food I tried (scallops entree, crabmeat california roll, various sashimi, a salad with shrimps, etc) was all creative and well appointed
Good wine list with some nice NZ Sauvignon Blancs and some good Gewurtztraminers for reasonable prices
Dessert was phenomenal
The best part, though, is the ambience: set in the chic W hotel, there's a beautiful flow to the whole space, with a Calder-like mobile and floortoceiling windows facing Times Square
Sip a martini and feel like one of the beautiful people before dinner
Not overly pricey for the location and the coolness factor
Go
It will impress your friends, especially those from out of town
The Scene When those cheese-and-wine cravings kick in, this pretty Provencal boite is just the answer
Hipsters with a Gallic bent while away the hours in a bright, itsy-bitsy dining room and sprawling garden, chatting around tables of wooden wine crates, and sampling Sancerre, Muscadet and Chinon from small carafes
Service is casual and clubby

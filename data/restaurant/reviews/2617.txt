They have an impressive wine list
Definately worth a try
I've been taking clients to dine here over the years and they never dissapoint
The food has been consistently great
The service is been terrific
It's a pleasure to dine here
Their pizza and pastas are the greatest
We had a post show dinner on a Friday night and was fairly empty when we showed up but was busy within the half an hour
A great location right in the Theatre District
The appetizers were really good and the main course was just good
Not sure how often they offer a theatre discount, but the night we went we received 10% off our meal with our ticket
Both my husband and I love food
We feel very passionately about different cusines, especially Italian
We spend a lot of time in Italy, because my husbands job
We love New York, because it has the best food from all over the world, all right here
This is our favorite Italian restaruant in New York
The pizza like that you can only find in Italy
We love it
Try the Dopo Teatro pizza with prociutto with a hint of trufle oil
Really amazing
We had a great dinner here
It was a group of 10
The service was amazing
Everyone was so happy with their selections
I had tuna tartar - really good - for appetizer and open duck ravioli, as an entree
Some of my friends had the veal, pizza and pasta all terrific
Everything was really great
We were all very impressed with how organized and amazing everything was
We are planning another dinner already
Highly recommended
My girlfriends and I went out on the town
We heard about this place from other friends and decided to try it
Boy, were they right
We had a wonderful time
The food was amazing
The best pizza I've ever had
My friend's steak was great; everyone was happy with their meal
We shared some appetizers, also great
Our waiter, Ludow, was great
He made our night
His wine recommendation was equisite and made everything that much better
If you go, try to be in Ludow's section, the best table in the house
Well we will definately be back and take our hubbies along this time
Highly recommended
My mom took me here for the first time for a pre-theater dinner
We had a great time
This is my mom's favorite place, so I didn't think I was going to like it, but I was wrong
The restaurant is beatiful
The high ceilings and the elegant decor create a wonderful ambience
The food is really what you come here for, amazing pizza
I brought my Italian husband here last night and he loved the pizza too
He said that's what pizza is like in Rome
He barely ever gives reviews like that, so check it out
I love this restaurant
I highly recommend it for dates and romantic dinners
My girlfriend loves the food and the interior design
We both work in the area, so it's convienient
They have a romantic garden downstrais
The veal is great, the steak is awesome
Fish, pasta and pizzas are great, so your date has a nice choice
The wine list has an impressive variety; the martinis are great too
I highy recommend it
i normally avoid times square like the bird flu
but i was going to a show and read great reviews of dopo, so why not
we ordered a glass of wine
waiter asked us if it was legal
being ID'd? ok
but we didnt know what he was talking about
the wine came ikea-like wine glasses
we ordered pizza as an appetizer (buffalo mozz, prosciutto, and arugula)
the waiter said that it was the best pizza on the menu
the cheese was so runny that the crust was soggy and it had wayyy too much garlic
the waiter asked us if he was supposed to throw the leftovers to the dogs? we also ordered the mahimahi and duck
the duck had little meat although the few bites i got were tasty
my girlfriends mahimahi was bland
check please
thanks to avenue q and ben and jerry's for redeeming our night
My boyfriend took me to the beautiful restaurant last week and I fell in love with it
The food is truely amazing
The atmosphere is romantic and grandious
The mood is just happy and up-lifting
Service was excellent
The waiter was very nice and helpful
He suggested a great bottle of wine for us, beautifully served with a decanter
I was very impressed, it just added to the romantic evening
We had a quiet, romantic dinner I had an delicious duck with roasted fennel
It was quite different and phenomenal in taste
My boyfriend opted for a rib-eye steak, which he was very satisfied with
We are going to be back for sure
Bravo
This is one of my true favorites in the theater district
I'm somewhat of a theater buff, so I'm pre-theater dining all the time
The restaruant is a beatiful space
The decor is exquisite
I love the dinning room with the high ceillings and the pictures of Italian cinema on the walls
The service is always friendly and prompt
They understand the pre-theater crowd
The service is fast and yet not pushy
The managers are always very friendly
Now, the really important thing is the food - magnificent

This was great
We were in the corner and it is a very clean bar
I would sit and eat at the bar again if there was a wait
The title says it all
The food is great, so great I keep comming back
Despite the fact that a waiter spilled oil on my friends suede shoes the service is consistently bad
The music is too loud as well, the decore is depressing
But, the food and price are worth it
One of the few good places to get a pie in NYC
This place does it right
Occasionally overcrowded with neo-LES types you can put up with it for the excellent pie
i'm italian and i had a great pizza in lil frankie, whoever thinks this pizza is bad means they do not know what good authentic italian pizza is!
try the focaccine with prosciutto and robiola
this will wake you up!
Although on the phone they take reservations for groups over 6, they squeezed my group of 7 at a table for 4 told us that we had to be out in an hour because they needed the table for another group
The bruschetta was toast with a tomato cut in half and placed on parmesan shavings
Best of all the waiter actually picked up a piece of pizza with his hands and moved it to another pie when clearing one of the pans away half way through the meal
Absolutely the worst service I've had in New York
I have nothing but great things to say about Lil' Frankies
Everytime I bring people here, everyone raves about it
Not only are the pizza delicious and quintessentially Italian (with thin crusts and fresh ingredients), but the ambiance is warm and friendly and busy and fun, and the dessert with Nutella is AMAZING! the waitstaff is sweet and never rushes you, and you really feel like you're in Italy
even the baby on the menu is adorable! i guarantee you'll love the place
here's to lil' frankies! (clink)
This place makes pizza just like they do in Italy
As an Italian, recently transplanted here in the Big Apple, I have found it difficult to find good, authentic pizza - perhaps not as good as they make it in Napoli but the crust is good and the toppings are, thus far, authentic
My wife asked the pizzaiolo to make a special pizza with tomato sauce, no mozzarella, fresh arugola and parmesan shavings and it was fantastic
Lil Frankies ROCKS
Excellent brick oven pizzas and good prices
The Thursday lasagna special is about the best and tastiest lasagna I've had in New York
having spent the last 3 months living in Firenze (Florence!), I was shocked by Frankie's wonderful pizzas and friendly staff
I was truly transported to my favorite Santa Croce restaurant, Baldovino! The front of the eatery features a homey feel with a takeout counter, great for families and a casual night
Meanwhile, the narrow back room is dimmly lit, with hanging plants overhead and a wall-covering wine rack
Lil' Frankie's is a delightful suprise offering all the comforts of a neighborhood eatery with a romantic, more sophisticated dining area as well
Super fresh, thin crust pizza, authentic cafe, and classic contorni! Mangia!
A friend suggested the place and he was dead on; the ceviche (seafood stew) was incredible-- and I usually don't like soups/stews
It's a small restaurant but the decor is great, makes for an intimate setting
The food is priced reasonably, it's the drinks that can be expensive but they are great, especiallly the margaritas! Great great great food, topped off with friendly service
Great Mexican Food that is reasonable and well prepared
Their Margaritas are top notch and I love the shrimp tacos
Portal is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood
First off, it's not expensive
Secondly, the food is quality
Most folks like the Fish Tacos, Shrimp Tacos, Enchiladas and the chips and Pico de Gallo
I personally recommend the Chicken Chilaquilles
Dining in is a very mellow and relaxing experience, which I always enjoy
The Sangria and Margaritas are excellent
Finally, the staff is very friendly and helpful
Buen Provecho!
It's authentic
Excellent Margaritas
Very Cool
Makes you feel like you're in Mexico
Service was good
Very cozy restaurant
The food was very good and authentic, especially considering the price
The waitstaff was very courteous and answered all questions
Specials were very interesting and different than the usual Mexican dinner entrees
The drinks are a bit overpriced, though - they cost more than some dishes!
Until recently, I was a big fan
Last visit, ignored by our waiter, we finally got beers and ordered food
As we waited (needing beer) table after table was served
After an hour, we flagged down our waiter
He said (with attitude) carnitas take a long time
then he split
I think it's more likely that he screwed up our order
Taking another chance, we ordered delivery one night at 8pm
8:45 we called and were told it was on the way
9pm he should be there
9
30 he's on the way
9
45, frustrated and hungry, we went to Mexican Radio
We came home to a message left by el portal at 10PM!!! TWO HOURS AFTER WE ORDERED!!!   It would be easier, FASTER, and less stressful to go to the store, buy ingredients and cook for myself
My guacamole is better anyway
The only way we found this place was b/c the outside was painted yellow
Nice little place in the basement drawing a hip village crowd
With the few tables expect a wait, even on a Tuesday nite at 10pm
Service was ok, took a while to order even drinks
But you definantly get a bang for the buck
I love this restaurant because the food is flavorful and flavorful Mexican is one of the few things that New York lacks in appropriate abundance
Portal is cheap, the food is amazing and the people who work there know about the food they serve and can make solid recommendations
The restaurant is best on a Monday night when its empty, but you gotta be pushy to get in the door on Friday night
Very cozy atmosphere
Good food for a reasonable price
Worth visiting if you can ignore owner's lack of social skill and the waitresses' absentmindedness
I have to say the food is sooo good here! The place is cozy and friendly, It's almost like being in a secret private party in Mexico
You have to try their specials which I bet you can't find anywhere else cause they are family recipies
I went for lunch and I got to meet The chef, Mrs
Gloria while she was prepairing the Chiles Rellenos, and while I was there I even made some new friends cause it seems like some customers from other states like Texas ot California consider the place there home away from home
Good eats, good prices, but owner man needs to get himself to a hospitality course quick!
In Short Austrian and German art may lure the masses to the Neue Galerie, but this authentic Viennese cafe gives visitors a reason to linger
European tourists and cultured Upper East Siders line up for a marble-topped table in the elegant, wood-paneled room serving Kurt Gutenbrunner's Viennese specialties, from chestnut soup to sausage to spaetzle
The real attraction, however, are the coffees, piled high with schlag (whipped cream), and the eye-catching sweets like dark chocolate cake with apricot preserves
We went to Cafe Sabarsky last Sunday
We got there at 1130am, and were seated immediately
Service was good, unintrusive, and we never got the feeling that they were rushing us, even though there was a line of like 35 people waiting to be seated
The coffee is great by any standard, but at $5 a cup it can get pricey
The savory food is ok, but the desserts are to die for
We shared a chocolate, pistachio and apricot cake that was simply amazing!
I went to Cafe Sabarsky this past weekend

I would definitely give it a try if you like going out for a good pasta or any other authentic italian cusine
Lovely staff, always on top of the customers
One of the best italian restaurant in NYC
I went there for the first time last night, i was very impressed, the service was excellent, cannot fault it
The food was the best i have tasted for a long time
It was a trully italian cusine
Congratulations to the owner and staff, i will certainly return and highly recommend it to my friends and as I live in the area shall look forward to coming back on a regular basis
I hate to add this review because I don't want everyone to find out about this amazing gem in the middle of Midtown
The food is outstanding, the service attentive and very friendly, and the atmosphere is romantic
The food is incredibly fresh has wonderful flavors
Try the salad in a parmesan basket--very unique and tasty
I would definitely go back over and over
Our favorite place in NYC!!!!
Superb food in a small and very romantic setting; quite a pleasant surprise
The service is attentive and personal without being intrusive - had a wonderful meal and a wonderful time
haven eaten at every restaurant in the city known as 'the best' to all that take me to them, i decided to try a place that i walk past every day
i have eaten here once a week since
the more people i have brought here, the more that i find eating here over and over again
great service, great people, excellent food, very comfortable
if it isnt on the menu, ask, and you will probably get what you want
great place!
A definite find to anyone who knows about this Manhattan secret
I bring my friends there and they're like How did you ever find out about this place
MMM Ever go to one of those restaurants where the food is great until 15 minutes after you've left the restaurant? Not this place
You feel so completely satisfied that you're tastebuds are begging until the next time you can go back
Not too expensive and certainly accessible to all areas
Two thumbs up!
this is really good
i can't believe it how great and fresh the food is
tuna carpaccio was outstanding, and than the stake tagliata con funghi, remind me of florentine food
try it also because is really inexpansive
I have to say this was the BEST Italian meal I've ever had- I am not exaggerating
The service was friendly and efficient, the atmosphere was intimate, elegant, yet comfortable
A versatile place- I could imagine a romantic dinner for two here or a solo lunch with a good book
The bread and dipping oil with roasted vegetables was a delicious start, and more unique than a simple oil
The salad was fresh and crisp, the calamari was tender and juicy with an extraordinary sauce, and the espresso was excellent
Now- the pasta- OUTSTANDING
I had the Spinach Gnocchi- it was amazing, with wonderful sauce laced with mozzerella chunks
I highly recommend this place!!!
Other New York restaurants could learn about service by coming here
Personal but inobtrusive service, willing to accommodate specific wishes about food preparation or sides
Been 3 times and it's always impressed me
Great Italian country food, colorful, tasty, well prepared
Comfortable, easy-to-access atmosphere that isnt stuffy but yet is very stylish
Love this place
In Short This ambitious Indian "brasserie" in midtown is handsomely decorated, with bay windows, framed fabric art and an outdoor deck
The kitchen offers an interesting variety of dishes from all over India, with notes on the menu as to their origin
Careful preparation using olive oil and fresh ingredients has garnered Bay Leaf acclaim for dishes like green chili chicken with fresh curry leaves, tandoori chicken salad and Hyderabadi stuffed baby eggplant
With all the hype in citysearch and good ratings, i went to this restaurant last Saturday
Actually the decor was good but except that everything was pathetic
I ordered assorted appetizer, but it didn't show up after 20 minutes so i checked with my waiter who was sticking by the computer all the time and showing his back toward us
he told it was gonna come in 5 minutes
Then he went to kitchen frowning and came with our appetizer right away, which was cold and stale
For our entree we had ordered fenugreek chicken and a vegetable dish
Our chicken wasn't cooked well and vegetable had some awful smell
We had to ask for water couple of times since the chicken was too spicy for my wife
Again we had to see our waiter's back all the time when we were eating
I had to pour wine all the time
Our waiter didn't even bothered to ask for dessert
I will never go back to this restaurant never ever and leave those unattaintive waiters unbothered
I was very disappointed considering I had been looking forward to trying Indian food for quite some time
My only prior exposure was a kosher Indian place near my parents
which seems like a paradox to begin with
So I go with an open mind
We ordered mulligatawny soup (bland bland bland), my boyfriend severely doctored it up with whatever it was they put down to go with the pita bread
We ordered a vegetarian dish, which was actually pretty good - the only saving grace
We order a fish dish, which claimed to be a filet; however it tasted like something right out of the Hudson somebody went and paid some guy for fishing on the pier
the service was terrible, the wait staff was laughing as they served our food which was extremely rude and something you just don't do
My boyfriend complained afterwards to management, and the only thing they did was send us some free rice pudding (which I don't even like)
They didn't take anything off the bill, and didn't really seem to find our outrage worth their time
I will not be going back, no repeat offender here
I suggest a boycott
Don't know what the problem was with the other poster
I was just there with my family and we had a ball
Great host
Made tea for us special upon request
The nan is sold by the order, maybe that was the issue
I have been to places where the nan keeps coming
I love this place and am taking out of town friends there tomorrow
Bay leaf was the perfect spot for a late fall supper!! A friend put me on to Bay Leaf and my husband, I and a few friends really had a very enjoyable time
We sat back by their tandoor - cute, open clay ovens behind a huge glass front - and it was such a treat to watch them prepare some of their juicy meat dishes and fluffy naans
I also found that the staff was very helpful and friendly in guiding us, as we are still new to Indian food
Their lamb dishes were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spices
I particularly liked this almond and saffron lamb dish we had
Overall, Bay Leaf is a must for those wanting to get a great taste for Indian cuisine!! 2 thumbs up !!!
This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend of mine
I went there expecting good food and good service
The food was decent
The service, however, sucked!!! The staff caters to non-Indian patrons only
If you are Indian, be prepared to wait longer than the non-Indian patrons for your drinks and your meal
I have experienced this on more than one occasion
If you're going for just the food, it's a decent place
If you're going for the experience, I wouldn't recommend it
Best upscale Indian fare I have ever had AND the food preparations are not greasy! Even though it is centrally located in Midtown, I still find that most people find out about this place via word of mouth! And wow is this place a find! I especially enjoy sitting outside as of late, as they also have a very cute, enclosed sidewalk caf! Experiencing such refined culinary fare while sitting outside and people watching proves to be a great time
Especially, with some of their ice cold Indian beers (for my boyfriend) or a martini (me)! Kudos to Bay Leaf!
All the food are delicious
We had several birthdays there and was able to sample a vareity of dishes all which was wonderful
Also had a lovely strawberry serbert shaped in a rose
A bit pricy but so worth it
i cannot say enough good things about bay leaf - and will continue to recommend friends and coworkers there

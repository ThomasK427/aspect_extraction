My wife shared 1 order of the langoustine pasta and 1 order of the grilled langoustines with the other young lady dining with us
Both versions of the langoustines were disappointing
The grilled ones in particular were overcooked, extremely dry, and utterly flavorless
To top it off, the next morning both my wife and I felt unwell, the type of unwell that one generally does not expect to have after eating at a restaurant of Thalassa's caliber
I hope that this meal is not indicative of the majority of experiences at Thalassa
Instead of sharing a wonderful Thalassa experience with family, friends, and co-workers, I only have this torrid tale
My friend and I came here last Thursday night
The space is gorgeous, especially the bar
The service was excellent: attentive, but not overbearing waiter
The food was very good
It is pricey though, so be prepared to spend that paycheck
I cannot say enough good things about Thalassa
Went on a Saturday night with a party of 7
Thalassa is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to downtown
The decor is modern with high, high ceilings and a pre-war architectural feel to the space
The entrace bar is beautifully done in stark white with blue contrast lighting behind the bar
To the left of the bar is the main dining space done in dark wood with white curtains and white furniture
Downstairs is another dining area which is quieter and cozier
The whole space has an Ian Schrager hotel feel to it: Beautiful, artistic, simple and elegant
The food is good although expensive and the service is excellent
A great place to expense
Also a perfect date spot if you are looking to really impress a girl but, reaching for your wallet might hurt
Had a few friends for dinner at Thalassa recently and we were all so delighted, that we were raving about the place the whole ride home
The restaurant was beautiful and the waiter was pleasantly accomodating
The appetizers were really tasty and the fish wonderfully fresh
They even have their own olive oil-which I naturally took home
I love anything Greek, and Thalassa brought back the memories of sitting bayside at a tavern in Greece sipping ouzo and enjoying freshly caught fish
I'll drink to that!
I wanted to impress a hot date and had heard rave reviews about this restaurant
I now know why! I consider myself to be a real foodie and had just had a great experience at Craft the week before so my expecatations were high
The entire experience was amazing
The decor is sexy and cool without being trendy
The scallop appetizer was, in my opinion 1 of the top 5 things I have eaten EVER!!! I am STILL talking about it
My main was the halibut which was cooked perfectly
The 1 downside was the apathetic service
While the waiter was extremely nice and accommodating, we sat for 10 minutes with closed menus and it was difficult to grab his attention
Although it could have been that he stayed away because I was very into my date
No matter - I will DEFINITELY be back!!!
I purposely created an account to leave a fantastic review about this restaurant! I told them it was an anniversary when i made the reservation and from the start of the evening, everyone was congratulating us
The service was impeccable and unmatched from anywhere else
It was very refreshing to have polite, courteous and attentive service, especially in NYC
The portions were perfect (almost too much) and although neither my boyfriend nor myself are not fish-connoisseurs and perhaps did not appreciate the 'freshness of the fish', the overall experience (the decor is beautiful!) was exactly what i was looking for for our anniversary
PLUS, they sent over a complimentary dessert (candle and all!) and wished us both a happy anniversary
and indeed it was!
I found this restaurant here on citysearch because of the high number of good reviews and when the night was over, I knew i had to write a review for them too
The service and decor was amazing
we never had to wait more than a minute for the waiter
and most importantly he recommended the Panpano, which is a fish that wasn't on the menu
it turned out to be the BEST fish i've had in NYC
make sure u try it!!!
Thalassa took me by surprise when i walked in last weekend wth a party of fifteen
The extravagant architecture and atmosphere was breathtaking
The greek wines were taste to perfection, continuing with appetizers, main course, and dessert
The fish fresh as you can find than anywhere else in NyC; everything was cooked to perection
Executive Chef Gregory Zapantis makes this cuisine work along with his staff, service was great, very knowledgeable of greek cuisine
The martinis are a must try, various selections for satisfying tastes of all customers
I highly recommend Thalassa Restaurant for a night out, dinner, or even a formal event; There are three levels to choose from to compliment the occassion, the wine cellar, the main dining area, finally the loft perfect for a private party in any sense
We were amazed with everything this restaurant had to offer us and will be returning very soon!
This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous
The food is excellent and the service is impeccable
But beware! The price of my cocktail was exhorbitant
$17
50 for a Stoli gimlet is a bit much
I took my date down to Thalassa for Valentine's Day
The decor was picture perfect, the Valentine's menu very ecclectic and very tasty, and the Peter Michael Les Pavots wine--just phenomenal
It was definately a very unique place, we had a wonderful time
I took some friends down to thalassa Thrs
night to cheer up a friend
We boldly went to introduce ourselves to the Chef
I secretly asked him if it was possible to surprise my friend with special dish
He gracefully obliged
She was so thrilled (so was I), Chef Zapantis surprised her with Sea Bass wrapped in kataifi that was so delicious, that we ordered another order so that the rest of us could share
It was sooo good
Needless to say, the only thing that was blue when we left the restaurant, was the blue light behind the bar :) *ps
love the mango martinis
Had a few friends visiting from San Diego and a friend recommended Thalassa for Seafood
WHile the seafood by the pound was the freshest I've had in a while, I was pleasantly surprized at the other entrees available on the menu-- Delightfully presented! We all walked away happy and well fed! Best recommendation I've had in a while
Had a fish called Lethrini - grilled, few appet octopus so tender, red mullets pan seared - after we ordered an amuse of baby soft shell crab from the chef, nice touch , strong kistler selection, yogurt from greece, beautiful looking crowd, staff pleasant not too friendly but great servers, alot of details
I dined at Thalassa with a group of friends having never dined there before and I was very happy with my choice
The restaurant itself is beautiful, from the bar/lounge area to the dining room, to the private room downstairs to even the bathrooms
The food was phenomenal
Must try the grape leaves and stuffed calamari and in general, the seafood dishes
My lamb was a bit on the well done side but was still tasty
Prices are reasonable for Manhattan and expert bartenders pour fine spirits
The mango mojito (I know mojitos aren't Greek) was incredible
The only negative thing I have to say is the maitre'd seemed a little tightly wound
He wasn't the friendliest guy I have ever met but he runs a mighty fine restaurant
Thalassa is DEFINITLY one place you will ENJOY your dining experience and come back craving for MORE!! Every bite is mouth watering, every moment catered to perfection
A must see, and be seen place!
I hosted my graduation party in their wine room the other night
and I am still in awe--days later
I am so happy with my choice to celebrate at Thalassa--the food was amazing, the service excellent, the wine perfect, and the ambiance just beautiful! Great friends coupled with exquisite surroundings made for a truly memorable night! The wine room is an excellent choice for a private celebration!!!
The food, the service, the wine! Everything was simply amazing
Romantic setting, beautiful decor, delicious food, lovely service
Price is a bit steep but definitely worth every cent! Highly recommend
Had about 50 guests for my birthday party in there new space loft had only hor derves and open bar - very private space great service foods
cant wait to go back for dinner
all my guests loved it
started with stuffed calamari scallops
highly recommend the tomatoe salad (best feta) main course Lethrini so unique, finished with molten chocolate cake

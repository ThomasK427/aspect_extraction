Everyone was so nice
A++ to your establishment
There aren't many places in the city I would wait until after midnight inorder to get a seating for dinner- this is one of them- great scene, great food, great music and when the patio opens up again in the warmer weather it is even better
try the tapas style dishes and sample a little bit of everything
We loved it all all thought the pork cubes were a little dry
Don't miss the Spanish tortilla or the coconut shrimp with mango chutney! The dirty clothes was also fantastic and more than enough to share!
What an excellent experience
I organized my friend's birthday party and what could have been a disaster turned out a great NYC night
I was planning on a small dinner party of 6 and after up-ing the list three times, we had a reservation at 10PM for a dozen people
14 showed !!! The hostesses were excellent
they were gracious and no attitude
We were seated promptly
The mojitos rock, fried ship was excellent, the yuca and croquetas are Miami quality or better, the grilled calamari is a must
Our server was nice, cute, and very attentive
The table next to us bought the birthday boy shots and live music played all night
We drank and ate
we were 14 people each drinking mojitos $10, (mind you not everyone ate) we ordered 18 appetizers, and the bill with tip included was under $400
Cheap !!! I love this place
We were told we'd have a 20-30 minute wait
After waiting 30 minutes, we complained
After an hour and 10 minutes, we were really upset and hungry
The hostesses were totally rude and seemed put off by our requests to be seated
After and hour and a half, we walked out and were not ever called by the hostess staff, despite the fact they had my cell number the entire time
Unacceptable
We will NOT go back!
The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is lively
They have great music and the live band is awesome
The only down side is I didn't love the food
I found the food a bit bland and much rather go to Victor's Cafe for a cuban dinner
This is a cool place to hang out at the bar and drink the night away
This is a pretty cool place to take the lady if you want to eat some good food
The person that took care of my table made sure that we were taken care of
The place is pricey so save your pennies, it will cost you
Son Cubano is fantastic
From the second I walked in I was excited to be there
The music is great and the ambiance is perfect
We enjoyed a great batch of sangria and the cocunut shrimp was out of this world
Our dinner was tastey, creative and well-worth every penney
I hightly recommend Son Cubano
Definitely a great place to impress out-of-town guests
If you haven't been, you gotta go
The food was great, the service was awesome and the ambience was perfect
I went on a Saturday night and had a blast
Lots of fun and great Sangria! You'll definitely see me there again!
The reason you go to Son Cubano, is to get giddy over mojitos, shout over the cuban music and enjoy the amazing decor
Yes, it's crowded yes, it's noisy: that's part of the fun
The waiters are attentive, even though the food does take forever to come out - but who cares? You're shakin' to rythm and sippin' sangria
Our group of 5 ordered a bunch of appetizers and they were all delicious - same with desserts
If you want to have a FUN dinner with a group of friends, this is the place to go
We ordered several appetizers, none of which were good
The black bean puree and the yucca frita were bland, the fish croquettes were too salty, the chicken something was SO dry and the pork dish had one bitesize piece of pork in it
Our cocktails were ok but at ridiculous dance club prices
I LOVE Cuban food and was so disappointed
I was looking forward to finding Manhattan Cuban but I guess I will continue to go to La Isla in Hoboken if I want spectacular Cuban food
I've been here twice
Went last week with my cuban parents and we all had a blast! The musicians are really cuban
The interior amusingly authentic
Mojitos are good, but little overpriced at $10, while the sangria hits the spot
Appetizers provide a great mix of traditional and modern flavors! My old school favorite here is the masitas de cerdo (great w/ black beans rice)
The noveau pick goes to the boniato w/ ropa vieja inside - genius, a must try!! Finally, a cuban place that's innovative, yet true to the cuisine - stylish, authentic, and affordable: Chvere!
Friday night without a reservation, I had to wait an hour and a half for a table for 3
Well worth the wait, bartenders were competent and fast
Being a Mojito fan, I was surprised to find that their $10 mojitios were made with rail rum, for that price they should at least give you Bacardi
We ordered WAY TOO much food
We ordered 2 apps and I was full by the time my entree arrived
Had the Lechon Asado ($15) which was out of this world
Total bill including tip was $100 and we were plenty liquored up and so stuffed I skipped breakfast and lunch today
:) See you there next Friday! (P
S
When the music is too loud, you are too old!)
A group of 10 of us went recently and had a really great time
We ordered lots of (actually too much) tapas and a few main courses to split among us all
With the sangria flowing, cocktails, beers and more food than we could eat, we had a very reasonably-priced evening ($50 each) for such a cool atmosphere, great jazz and latin music, and such delicious food--especially the grilled octopus! The red snapper was only so-so, but the steak and the paella were great
I agree with other reviewers that it is far, far too loud near the band
request a table as far away as possible, preferrably outside if it is a nice night
don't worry, you will still hear the music! the service is a bit inept, but the food is good, the room is nice looking, the prices are reasonable, and it is very convieniently located to go out afterwards
(It is right next to Lotus and across the street from Filter 14
) there is a large table near the front that looks like it would be good for a big group
Because the service is excellent and attentive, the food is beyond delicious, the drinks are very well prepared, and it's a lively, exciting atmosphere
The music contributes to the overall feel of the place, which means that it's loud and fun
Hispanic culture thrives on this type of environment, and the restaurant caters to those seeking something a little more than your average dining experience
As long as that's what you're looking for, Son Cubano delivers
If you seek quieter pleasures, look elsewhere
Our party of 3 could hear each other just fine, perhaps because we weren't trying to whisper sweet nothings, just have some fun
Bring earplugs, learn sign language or take lots of aspirin with your mojito
You'll have a headache by the end of the night from the pointlessly loud environment
It can't be a good thing to be yelling at your date to get the salt from one end of the table to the other
While the food's not bad, the service is indifferent and the space is hostile
It's cool to go to places to be see and be seen, but usually you want to be heard as well


Don't be fooled by the menu
Only the salads are vegetarian, and even there you should double-check with the kitchen
The waiter came back after I had finished my appetizer to correct himself and let me know that it wasn't vegetarian (chicken stock) after all
The menu seems to have some selections, but nothing panned out
Beyond this the kitchen wasn't even gracious about leaving the meat off other items
Quite a scene
Perhaps going on Valentine's Day isn't typical--or maybe it is! The place was packed, loud, and hopping
Loved: The live Cuban band, large menu of innovative and classic Cuban food, yes, the Mojitos are good--in small glasses, $10 a pop, but pack a nice kick
The Sangria was also nice, but the apples tasted funky

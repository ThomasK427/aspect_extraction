Nice place to go with a few friends or significant other; order a bottle of wine and some apps and take it easy
Once Im done with my shopping this weekend, I'll defitnely be in
Great food, good price, beautiful restaurant
Spicy Sour Chilean Sea Bass Soup, Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Vietnamese Boneless Duck were excellent
Didn't even notice it was there and I walked right by it so many times
Decided to stop in for drinks after work and stayed to have dinner with friends
Food was great
It was a little quiet at first but soon as it started getting later in the evening - the place was pretty happening
Overall - Had a great time
an all time favorite of mine
great ambience and atmosphere
the food is great and always lots of fun
try the oysters and duck
My fiance threw a surprise party for me at Apple
We celebrated with 50 closest friends and family members
Apple did an amazing job for us
Our guests raved about the food and the service
The service was impeccable! The manager of the restaurant and his waitstaff took care of every single details to ensure that we have an enjoyable night
Thank you Apple for making the best night of my life so memorable!
very nice and sleek looking
Beautiful private room and gorgeous lounge
Took friends visiting from out of town to brunch here
The service was awful
It was impossible to get refills on coffee or water, and the waitstaff basically ignored us because there was one other, larger party there
We ended up being an hour late to a baseball game because it was so impossible to get any attention!
I love the music they play there
the Friday DJ is more of an underground overall DJ speacializing in underground and oldschool hiphop
I wish he'd play more RB, but hey
The Sat
Dj is more of a show-y type, really good too
is delicious
great place for after work drinks
lacks ambience for any other time
After having eaten practically everything on the menu I can honestly affirm this is by far the finest restaurant in all of New York City
It is the finest by the old standards: phenomenal food, kind and attentive staff
My husband and I have been eating there for almost three years
Impart because of the atmosphere, food, price and staff, we have called their kitchen home for not only ourselves but to our family and friends
The menu has delighted all of us, as it is different, healthy, and offers a range of delightful dishes for those wanting to feast on meat or game as well as those favoring sushi or quinoa
Sundays brunch spread is absolutely delicious, offering wheat free pancakes topped with fresh fruit
If you are not hungry for a meal, try their apple or lychee martini in the lounge
I promise you will not be disappointed
Great papaya salad
Great, decently priced specialty martinis
Great music
Go there for some drinks in their supercomfy couches with lots of friends or for dinner, with small or large groups
Great place
Not overly expensive
We heard great things about this place
probably went there with very high expectations
We were treated to some undercooked apple pancakes
all food served cold
shiverschills
it still gives us the creeps
Very lousy service
had to sit and wave at the waiters to get their attention
We just hope it was a VERY BAD DAY for the restaurant and they are usually better
But you can't drag us into this place ever again
Apple Bombar rules
Its got big comfortable black leather couches and a staff that is friendly and courteous
Its a great place to pre-drink, or end the night
There is no dancing, or anything like that but its a great place to kick back and hang out with friends
We had a friends B-day here and they were great
The service was excellent and very friendly
We originally planned the b-day at another place but it was packed so we decided to go to Apple Bar
they were able to seat 20 of us easily
They have great hip hop music
I went here a few times later and still the same great service and appetizers
It's kinda hard to get seating at the couches and at the bar, but the backroom always has plenty of seating
This place is one of my favorites!
Everything~ EVERYTHING on their menu is delicious!! The service is pretty fast
It's a really pretty place too
I had my boyfriend's birthday dinner there, and everyone loved it
I took my friends there this past weekend and they loved it too! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves flavorful and quality foods for a good price
I found this place here on Citysearch along with a few others as possible places to go on my birthday with friends
What a great choice! The food was excellent and the menu was varied
I was there with two girlfriends-- one a vegetarian, the other a dancer-- everyone got something they loved
The Apple Martinis are marvelous
The Ginger Ice Cream is incredible
But the slow-cooked, almost fat-free Duck was to die for
I went back the next week with a date and had it again
Definitely a new favorite for me
The Scene It may take you a couple of tries to find Yama, a Gramercy sushi restaurant located in the basement of a house that Washington Irving lived in
During dinnertime, however, the gang of people waiting for one of the closely packed tables should tip you off to the location
The Food Tasty appetizers like crackling fried soft-shell crabs with a sweet ponzu sauce, wasabi-flavored steamed pork dumplings, and Japanese eggplant with miso paste make a good segue into fresh-tasting sushi entrees like the sushi deluxe, which represents one of the better values anywhere
Yama's portions tend toward the gargantuan--the massive wooden boats and platters of sushi that serve groups seem sized to feed twice as many people as they claim to satisfy
I was impressed with the size of the sushi rolls and even sashimi
very big
Yama is by far the most consistent place for good quality sushi in NYC! Although the price (average $5-7 each piece) is more on the high side, their Special Rolls ($7
50 for hand roll or cut up) is a great way to get full (and won't empty your wallet)
Lastly, this place is always pack! But, you can avoid long waits (30+ minutes) by showing up either slightly before 7pm or 9pm
If you like large pieces of sushi, this is the place to go
Get there early or plan to wait a long time
Decor wise Yama is your typical local Japanese restaurant with light, wooded trimming and a clean, simplistic interior
What really sets it apart is its sushi
Not only is the sushi fresh and good, it is served in large portions and decently priced
Everything I had from the sashimi to my dragon roll surprised me both in taste and portion size
This is a great place to go with friends who really love sushi
The only con? It is ALWAYS packed at any respectable dining hour so apparently the secret is out
I would recommend making reservations but even then you may be waiting 10-15 mins to actually get seated
In the end, I think it's worth it

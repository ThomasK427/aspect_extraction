Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble

The Space The bright and spacious John's Times Square bares little resemblance to its legendary Greenwich Village forebear
There's a sweeping staircase to the second floor tables, with a giant mural depicting the cityscape across the wall
Happily, the acclaimed brick-oven pizza hasn't changed
The Pizza A tomato and cheese pie--alas, slices aren't available--will run you $12
50, and each topping will add another buck to your tab, but it's more than worth it
Fresh garlic, sausage and pepperoni are all wonderful toppings, but don't pile too many on: This is New York-style pizza we're talking about, not Chicago, and it has the thin, charred crust that's a Gotham trademark
Amazing pizza, but they have even better house salads
The key to the salad is the dressing which I'm positive they could sell in stores and make a fortune, its that good
Be sure to dip your crust in the leftover dressing
The reviews about the service are TRUE
I go to this place probably once a week (bad service doesn't stop me)
Most of the servers are washed-up wanna be actors that work for a 2nd source of income and feel their real job is on Broadway
The key to good service is not to act like a tourist, if they think you are a lowly out of towner it takes a toll on your service (which should take a toll on their tip)
Overall, the food is excellent and is worth the wait
I just don't understand the BAD reviews that so many have voiced on this place
I've eaten at this restaurant 3 times in two years (most recently 6/24/06)
The food is wonderful
The ambiance is fantastic, and the service is average to good
I highly recomend the tomato/cheese pizza, then add spinach and fresh garlic
It is truly a party for foodies!  When in NYC
John's is a safe pick for taste and value
i always come here after watching movies at times sq, because its open late, that area in general is a rip-off, and the pizza is great
you first choose a base pizza ive only tried the regular margherita (tomato sauce mozzarella) and the bruschetta (fresh tomatos and mozzarella)
the bases are about $14 for a medium $16 for a large
toppings are approximately $2
25 each
the pizzas are made to order in huge brick ovens and you can see the guys flipping and topping the pizzas with amazing speed at either side of the restaurant
the pizzas are thin crust, crispy, and not super greasy since they arent extremely heavy on the cheese
the space itself is huge, split story, with very high ceilings
my friend said that the inside reminds [him] of a church
its my favourite place in the area
The service was one of the WORST I've ever seen
The food was average at best
The pizza is much better at the parlors in the Village
The chicken parm tasted like cardboard, the re-heated frozen kind
The building itself is nice, with a huge main rooom
Did I mention the awful service? Everyone - the hosts, waiters, etc were unattentive and indifferent to the customers
fine for a reasonably priced group dinner, but the service is horrible and the food is mediocre
i had some family visiting from out of town and, after the treatment we received, was embarased to have suggested the place
Was told this was the best pizza in NY
With high expectations, my family and I arrived and were told by hostess that wait was 30-40 minutes
More than 70 minutes later we were finally seated, but noted that a number of other parties checked in and were seated before we were (and we didn't have a big party -- just three people)
Both the appetizer (garlic bread) and pizza were actually *below* average
Huge disappointment, and really (really) not worth the wait
Aside from the not-helpful hostess, service was actually pretty good
Wish the food would have been worthy of the hype
The pizza was like frozen pizza
NO LIE
The fresh cheese was nowhere to be found and the sauce tasted like something out of a jar and the olives were the regular canned olives like you get at dominoes
I asked the waiter if the business changed hands recently or if they changed the recipe but he said it was the same as its always been
The table accross from us looked like the people who were sitting there got there food and walked out after one bite
Who could blame them
We used to hold this place in the same regard as grimaldis in brooklyn or Angelos up on 57th street but no more! AVOID AVOID AVOID!
This was always on my 'to visit' list when I was a NYC tourist- any trip to NY had to involve one meal at John's Pizzeria
Now that I am a NYC resident, this is on the list of places that I take visiting friends to eat at, usually before seeing Bway shows
Highly recommend!!
I work in midtown and when my family comes to town I bring them to John's pizza
Normally the service is good but the last time I went there everyone from the hostess to the Manager were incredibly rude
We had 2 small children with us and with the restaurant half empty they still made us wait over 45 minutes for a table
I will never go back
Extremely unaccomadating and truly the worst service I have ever received in a New York Restaurant
The food is average and definitely not worth the attitude
The crust was doughy(undercooked), the sauce indifferent, and the cheese rather generic tasting
This was not even up to the standard of an average New York pizza, let alone one of the best
I have been to Johns several times
The key is to beat the rush
If you get there about 5PM or so, you will have no problems being seated and getting decent service, even with a large group (I have been with groups of up to 14 people)
The marinara brick oven pizza is the best we've had
It has chunks of garlic and the perfect thin crust
Just that with no extra toppings and a Caesar salad make a very reasonable and delicious light dinner
It is kid friendly too and they will even find a place for your stroller
I was a bit dissapointed after reading all the reviews of this place
I guess my expecatations were too high because the pizza just tasted like every other pizza around the neighborhood
I ordered a small (14) sausage and mushroom pizza for $17
The crust is nice and thin, but again, nothing you can't get at any other pizza place in the neighborhood
The pizza isn't bad, but just not worth the price when you can just go around the block
Being from out of town, we were recommended by the concierge at our hotel to eat here
We were promplty sat at a table for 5
Our waiter looked at us 3 times but never greeted our table for over 5 minutes
We had to ask another waiter to get him
Once he came over he only asked what we wanted to drink and took our order
4 of the 5 orders came out correct
He never said one word to us the whole time we were there
After done eating it took him another 10 minutes to clear our table and drop the check

The belly dancer was amazing, makinge everyone get out of their seats to dance with her
The huge disappointment was the service
The waitress took forever to take my order and the other waitresses and hostesses had major attitude as if this was some exclusive spot
There were so many guys waiting in the line outside that the hostess was only letting them in if they had at least two girls with them! Definitely recommended for the single ladies, otherwise this meat market had a little too much meat
Once you have gotten in and a table, no small feat, I feel you will love Le Souk
I have had the Lamb Bedouin twice, simply amazing
The atmosphere is fantastic, only place I have EVER seen a male belly dancer, and the music is great
Make a reservation and bring people from out of town
If you are celebrating a birthday, anniversary, or just some special occasion for a person WHOM YOU HATE, I recommend going to Le Souk
The restaurant managers cannot even extend the service of making a reservation without informing when your party will have to leave the table
In our case, our party of eight was allowed to occupy space in the souk from 8 pm to 10:30 pm on a Saturday night
Dont worry, you will have no trouble finishing the meal in the time allotted
For one, at Le Souk meze means miserable in terms of portion size
Looking at the plate, one would think that hummus and dips are priced like caviar, so stingy are the servings
Everyone in our party opted for the $32 price fix course, whose only benefit is humoring the restaurant owners as they review the weekend takings
The quote you receive on the phone is not the 'Actual Price' nor 'what they meant'
The waitresses have attitudes, don't expect too much from them
The seating for dinner is uncomfortable, too close to the bar which gets really crowded since it is so small
The food is ok, but the price is ridiculous! Not worth it
The Bellydancer was a plus and the decor was very intimate
I love coming to this restaurant
Although the food is so-so, the ambiance is incredible! One thing though, their servers need an attitude check
There was this girl who was so rude to us, she totally ruined out night and was unapologetic about it when we confronted her
I would recommend doing drinks and not dining in
The first time I went to Le Souk was six months ago for a birthday party
Since then I have been going there every single week
The food is really good but the ambiance and the music are amazing! I take all my friends ther and they love it
we have almost all of our birthaya at Le Souk
It's a great place for big groups, so much fun! I strongly reccomend reservations since it gets really packed, especially on weekends
Face it, if you are not good looking or you don't know somebody, get out of line and walk off to another bar
Le Souk isn't for everyone
Who wants to be in a place that lets everyone in? Le Souk is great every night of the week; a true NYC hidden hangout
Sun/Mon are the best nights to go
amazing crowd
Take a pocket translator, not too many people you'll meet will speak English
I don't recommend this place for people who want an average evening amongst an average crowd
Waitstaff is preoccupied dancing on the bar and googling at beautiful people, but who can blame them
Management is what it is--foreign
Seperate rooms allow for different genres of music
Several nights of the week they feature a talented bongo player who commands the dance floor over the sound of the dj
Coatcheck is slow, but what can you expect
We visited Le Souk in March of 2005
I can't comment on the food because we just went for the drinks
The whole place is just really neat and the music was really good
Even though the bottle service is expensive it was worth it to get a good table so that we could look down at the crowded dance floor
If you want a fun night out, this is a place to try
This place was recommended by couple of friends , i never believed what i heard till i checked it myself
its fun , food is great , music is off the hook
go there
Le Souk has an awesome vibe from the moment you walk in
Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, great music, great dancing, great eye-candy and much much more
Try the flavored tobacco in the hooka pipes,Romantic sexy all the way! Amazing lamb ! GO AND CHECK IT OUT! I, I always recommend this place to friends from out of town, they always thank me after they've gone
It's a great place to go w/ a large group of tight-knit friends, you'll have a blast, keep the drinks comin' all night! Just as good of a night, if not better if your going with your honey
Lighting is low, vibe is sexy, the food is even sexy! Great impression for a first date! You can spring for it men!
The food was absolutely amazing, as was the staff
The entire experience was exceptional; from the dinner to the desert, the dancing, the atmosphere, etc
Definetly a place I will make a ritual whenever I am out
Well done!!
i went there on a weekday and place was way overpriced expensive drinks and lousy food
music was ok i wouldnt go back
After my experience at Le Souk last night, I think it should be renamed Le Suck
The service was horrendous
We had a reservation and when we arrived at the restaurant there were 7 tables free
Nonetheless we were seated right next to the door on a night that was way below freezing
We asked to be moved, but the hostess just walked off in a huff
The food wasn't so hot either
$32 for a measly appetizer and grilled vegetable plate
When the manager came to our table at the end of the meal and asked how our experience was, I complained to him about the cold
He didn't acknowledge my complaint
This place was way too expensive for Ave B
For 6 people, our bill came out to $330
This restaurant should really be located on Ave F because that is the rating I would give it
Expect one thing when you go to Le Souk for dinner: the worst service in town and below average food
That is too bad because the decor is quite nice
The waitress was beyond rude to our party
After tiping her 10% (which was already too much considering the poor service), she chased us down the street to ask for more!
I went to Le Souk for xmas dinner w/my family and friends, 9 total
When we got there, our waitress was extremely rude and demanded that we order from the pre-fixe menu and wouldn't show us the regular menu
When we ordered 5 pre-fixe meals (because some of were sharing), she became even more rude and we had to call the manager
After arguing some, we had to settle for his offer of ordering at least 6 pre-fixe meals
That really ruined my enthusiasm for this place including the food, which was average
The bellydancer, who they had said would be around from 9-11pm, didn't show up until 11pm right when we were leaving
This place sucks for big froups and dining
The one good thing was the music and the dancing in the bar area, but I don't think I'll be going back there
after seeing Rachel Rey of the food network do a review, I decided to venture out on a friday night
Reservations are recommended so you don't get placed by the door
Apps/meal was good
If you order fish, remember to ask them to take the head and tail off
the chocolate desserts are good, but the baclava was sub-par
I'd stick to the apps/meal and enjoy the opium den
The belly dancy comes out for two dances every hour or so, so make sure you are seated before the show (call ahead to confirm dancing times)
make sure you have the address, since there is no sign outside
hostess was beyond rude
i had made a reservation a month before and reconfirmed on TWO occasions
as soon as i arrived she indicated that there was a problem with the number of people on list -- you would think that someone would have called me before the day of event
she was not accomodating at all and had even suggested that i call ALL my guests and ask them to come at a certain hour because we're picky with whom we let in on saturday nights
i was more than patient with her and was later told that a lot of my guests were turned away at door because restaurant didn't know of party
don't bother speaking to manager/bouncer
they just rolled their eyes at me and walked away when i tried to explain situation
Don't be fooled by the ambiance at Le Souk

The drinks were great but I had never a $36 round for 2 drinks before!!!! After being seated, we were sat at a wobbly table which was eventually fixed after a few tries
The food was delicious but the portions were tiny given the prices
Luckily I had a few pieces of bread to fill me up
If you want to go to a sharp looking restaurant and have good food and you don't have to worry about $, then Town is a good choice
If you are like most people and want to feel like you got your money worth, then there are many better choices
If you appreciate delicious food served by a too-cool-for-school wait staff lacking social graces, Towns the place for you! Six of us went today for a late lunch for restaurant week, and upon leaving the restaurant, unanimously agreed that we were disappointed with our experience due to the sub-par service
We loved the food served during all three courses; the striped bass, duck a l'orange, lobster bisque and chocolate cake were sensational
We did NOT appreciate the 30-plus minute lull between courses, being seated under the stairs (where dirt from people's shoes above could fall on our heads), or that our bill came with dessert and coffee in an obvious attempt to rush us out
A staffer also told us to find our own coats in the coat closet
If restaurant week bothers the Townies so much they forget their manners, I have two words of unsympathetic advice: dont participate
I went with four people, we all ordered different things and shared
There wasn't one bad piece of food on the table
I'm glad I wasn't paying because the bill came to $400
Went to this restaurant last night and when my party arrived our table was not ready
When we were finally seated we proceeded to order a bottle of wine and appetizers as well as entrees
The waitstaff was not particularly nice
We received our appetizers and upon completing them WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED for our entrees
After asking the waitress and wine steward where it was we decided to leave
it should not take almost 30 minutes to get food at a restaurant that charges almost $70 a person for a prix fixe menu
I would not recommend this restaurant
In celebration of my birthday, my fiancee and I went to Town in every sense of the phrase
A refreshing, albeit pricey, cocktail kicked the evening off nicely and the subsequent meal excelled in every way
A sublime appetizer of escargot risotto reduced my fellow diner to a state of bliss that few molluscs are generally capable of, in so doing setting a standard of excellence that the entrees would find almost impossible to match, though they came extremely close
This is not a cheap dining experience, but in terms of quality deserves to be the talk of the Town
The space exudes a warm glow, thanks to the faux blonde wood backlighting along the back wall, which compliments the space wonderfully
The space manages to be initimate and slightly cavernous at once
The service provided was exceptional, with our wonderful server returning to explain the dishes
The food was sublime
Awesome reversal of textures play on the tongue
The roasted tuna had a meaty texture, while the medium rare lamb textured more like tuna
As mentioned, save room for the petit fours
They're as awesome as the rest of the meal
I've been to Town many times, and the food is always good
The service has been mediocre at best and the last time I was there it was horrible
We had reservations for 3 and were on time
They made us wait for our table for an hour, after saying it was getting set up like 5 times
Sat us at a table for 6 where we were so far from each other we couldn't hear, and proceeded to be very rude
I go to a lot of nice restaurants and I have never been treated as badly as that evening
I will not be going back
I can't understand how a place, where service is key to making people happy and getting repeat customers, would allow its customers to be treated that way
I was at Town last night
This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The service was flawless
The food was SO good
I don't know how you could ever go wrong here
Granted the prices are a bit high but you definitely get your money's worth in terms of quality
Would definitely go back!
Seated right away
Service was a 10
Excellent wine list
Portions a bit small but the food was very rich and I felt satisfied at the end of the meal
Definitly don't miss out on the desserts
All in all, an excellent experience!
I had a great experience at Town the other night
The drinks were AMAZING and the service was extremely friendly
Although I did not go down to the restaurant area, I was in the back lounge, my friends and I had a great time and the food was not only hot, it was incredible
Its definitely worth the effort to go and check it out for yourself
If the food is out of your price range then at least go for happy hour for a drink - although the drinks cost a bit more then the average happy hour bar after you receive one you would agree that it is worth it
Town is so amazing! Such fantastic food in a glamourous and elegant setting
The sommelier was excellent -- we told him our favorite Chardonnay (which wasn't on the wine list) and he suggested one that was very similar to it and equally delicious
I started with the garlic risotto with escargot and black truffles -- it was so creamy and flavorful
For my entree, I got the rib eye and short rib -- cooked to perfection, so tender! Even the sides of potato puree and spinach were excellent
My boyfriend's halibut was slightly undercooked, so he sent it back -- the result was not only a fresh piece of perfectly cooked fish, but also a complimentary spread of FOUR desserts! I was in heaven! Only con was the cost -- our dinner for two was $400!
I do not understand all these positive reviewes
perhaps I just went on a bad night but it ws horrible
Took 70 minutes to get our food
The Salmon was cold and uncooked, we had to send it back
We ordered vanilla yogurt for dessert which was sour
Stay away unless you don't mind getting ripped off
You may think I exaggerated the above, but I didn't
Just a terrible experience
The best of the best , i love it
beautyfull people, beautyfull color, the coktails, the food,the music
It is juste an experience you have to try once in your life
Went to Town for a romantic evening, the food was trully incredible, had a taste of one of the signature cocktail Town cosmo and the service outstanding
We simply loved it and will definitely go back there for a Sunday Brunch
If you're looking for a place to see and be seen, go to Town
If you're looking for a beautiful restaurant, go to Town
If you're looking for a great meal, skip it! The food was not awful, but when you are paying $100 a person (without wine), you expect greatness
Everything we were served was lukewarm at best
The lobster bisque was watery, the risotto undercooked and salty
The duck entree was fine, but portions were ridiculously small (half a duck breast???)
The only redeeming thing was the cheese sampler for dessert, although it would have been nice to be able to make my own cheese choices
I was thoroughly underwhelmed
Beautiful rooms filled with beautiful people, but expensive for what it is ($68 prix fixe), limited menu, tiny portions, reeeeeeeally slow service, undercooked potatoes with the cod, less than fascinating desserts
Despite having reservations, we waited for 45 minutes
We were sent to an elobarately designed bar for drinks
It was as if this is all thought out beforehand so we'll spent money at the bar
After all the waiting, we lost interest in the food which was mediocre
We were also puzzled by having tables in the middle of the stairway and underneath it
good thing we didn't get stuck in them
Chef Zakarian will wow you with every dish on the menu in this romantic Town
I recommend the Risotto of Escargots for the first course
The waitstaff is very attentive, the restaurant is beautiful and quite romantic
The bill can get quite high if you add a few drinks to your pre fixe 3 course meal but the food is delicious
Arrive early and have a drink in the lounge that overlooks the dining room
The apple martini is very good and although $14, they give you the shaker which pours 2 full glasses
The bathrooms are worth a peak as well!
Town is great
Very inviting
Food is great

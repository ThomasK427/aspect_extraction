The Food  The over-the-top dcor's certainly the reason to visit La Caverna, as the food is rather ordinary
An unsurprising selection of Italian staples is given standard treatment
Appetizers are the safest bet, including a bountiful calamari plate or the appropriately earthy mushroom polenta
Entrees, however, can be oversalted, especially the otherwise decent lobster ravioli
The homemade desserts, such as a light-as-air tiramisu, fare much better
Then this is the place for you! The cave atmosphere is cool, made it very cozy, our waitress was prompt and quite nice, for late night cocktails it'll work
However, DO NOT eat here
I haven't had fake mashed potatoes since I was a kid in camp, my chicken dish was OK, not amazing
I actually ended up getting sick afterwards, so eat at your own risk
it's basically a bar/lounge that serves food, not a restaurant
La Caverna should go into the Bar/Clubs section too
Always has good music after 11:30/midnight- hip-hop, reggae, etc
Average prices ($8 for mixed drink), bartenders are tricky
Watch out for the dark-haired girl who makes you show ID for water! The long-haired guy is nice, though, as is the bathroom bouncer, Manny
Sometimes he'll dance with you while you wait
Lots of tables and chairs to put your jackets, so no real need for the coat check
The tables are free, so you don't have to get a bottle that costs $250 that other lounges require - ridiculous! I've been here on a few Fridays and Saturdays a couple times this year already, and it's always cool
Parking can be tricky (watch for parking reg's that prohibit parking at meters from midnite to 3 AM)
I had dinner at La Caverna with a group of friends recently
It was the worst dining experience of my life
The waitress was totally inept - when we asked to order wine and for a round of waters (since we were sitting for 30 minutes without getting any), she snapped one thing at a time! We tried two different wines, they were both bad
We waited over an hour for our food, which tasted worse than your average school cafeteria fare
Out waitress never came back to our table after taking our food orders
The DJ played terrible cheesey techno at an unbearable volume
We could barely hear each other talk
Then of course the after-dinner drinks crowd swarmed in and started hovering over our table while we tried to choke down the rest of our dinner
Do NOT eat here!
This was the worst dinner I have ever had in New York
First, the bartender had to come back four times to ask us to repeat our five drinks -- she wasn't sure how to make a gin martini
We sat, waited a half hour for bread and water, another half hour for appetizers, and at least ONE HOUR more for dinner
The food was about as good as cafeteria food, but not as warm -- from the instant mashed potatoes and frozen breaded chicken to the tasteless pasta
We waited another hour to see the waitress again to get the check
The music was bad bad techno, and the famed space was a conglomeration of Starbuck's furniture, lame pseudo-Goth curtains, stalagtites, and tables that looked like they came from a low-end catering service
I came with guests from out of town, and it was an almost comically bad experience
I have been here three times already
I love the ambiance, it makes you feel as if you are in an actual cave
The food is good, not excellent, they should work on the menu and have more choices
Overall, it's a place to experience and have a nice romantic date
It's very cozy and relaxing
Should go on a weekday to avoid crowds
I have no idea who these people are who like the ambiance of this place
it's totally cheesy! Think Disneyland ride
Maybe good for a laugh, but please have some class and don't bring a date!
Went for a friends party
way to crowded
They over book the place for 4 parties
Made everyone wait in a line
was no list
Very disorganized, the bouncers didn't care, rude
I dont see anything special about this place
Once down stairs, you could hardly make it to the bar
Not a place to throw a party
Not worth it
HORRIBLE!
I ordered carpaccio with parmesan cheese
What I got looked more like a chef salad from a bad greek diner--and it wasn't carpaccio, it was roast beef
I had a steak that was tough and overcooked
My friend had pasta
Both were so salty that my mouth was literally in pain from eating it
I had read one of the other reviews that mentioned the excessive salt but never dreampt it would be to that extent
The place was empty, and the decor is not cool--it looks like a cheesy ride at EPCOT
Stay away, trust me
I had a birthday party at La Caverna and was immediately struck by the strange bathroom-y smell in the cave
It could have been just that day but the food was extremely average
I don't think I even finished my bland penne vodka
The service was good although extremely slow
All in all there are much better restaurants in NYC to go to
However, the space was pretty big so I could see why people would choose this place to have large parties
This place was one big yawn
La Caverna was a great time for me and the party I was with
We were seated immediately in a section with couches a table and a hookah
The place was not overcrowded to the point where you couldn't move, but had enough people to keep the place lively and jumping
The service was quick, food decent
Great DJ on the Thursday i went
Overall a very fun experience, something unlike your ordinary New York bar
i came here for a birthday party
a huge one at that and it was a lot of fun
but then again, that could have had a lot to do w/ my friends rather than the space itself
but it was good times, good music, great lighting and quick service despite the crowd
worth trying once for sure
The creator of this rest/lounge had a very interesting concept for the space; the location lends itself well for the idea
So sorry,however, to see execution of the design fell short of cavernous ambition
Must note: ceiling was marvolous feat, everything under it, however, lacks luster
Tables, settings, and layout look like an afterthought
The waterfall, by the way, is nothing more than a leaky faucet
Unfortunately, the drinks and food were also nothing to write home about
Maybe, if venture here again on a very crowded night, it would be distracting enough not to notice the short-comings
Escape the city and go to the Cave If you want to be a CAVE MAN go to La Caverna it's FUN FUN FUN!
La Caverna was an amazing place to spend Valentine's Day
Outside the rain sent couples scurrying under umbrellas, as we dashed into an elaborately decorated entrance stairwell
Once downstairs, friendly and helpful hostesses took our coats and umbrellas
It was like stepping into a cave! Inside as we waited momentarily for our table, the bartender made light conversation as he made our drinks
Our tiny table was in the back behind dark drapes, and near a waterwall fountain
The table was a little wobbly, and our waitress tried to fix it but we didn't mind
It was very cozy
The food was delicious and well prepared
The bread and water was constantly being refilled
We can't wait to go back for the bar scene on a weekend night to check out the big, leather chairs and hookahs at every corner
La caverna is a fabulous place for parties, I had birthday party there and everything was so nice, it went well, the owner gave us everything he promised
The atmoshpere was very cozey, the drinks were good, and the prices are very reasonable

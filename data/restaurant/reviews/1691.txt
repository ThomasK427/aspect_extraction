The food is always great and the kitchen, with a big roaring oven fire going in plain view of the customers, is a groovy touch
Try the Turkish beer and the chicken pitza
it's out of this world
I think the garden decor should be updated to look as arty as the inside, but other than that it's a great place to bring friends or a date
Cozy little restaurant with delicious food - love the steaming pita right out of the oven, and the ouzo, which you can't always find at middle eastern joints
Surprisingly reasonable prices too, for NYC
If your searching for a new hole-in-the-wall place to eat, this is it!  This is a fabulous inexpensive restaurant with superb food
It is small but cozy with the kitchen in almost full view
Almost like a pizza parlor, oh wait it is sort of
They serve Mediterranean style pitzas with an assortment of toppings with many vegetarian and vegan dishes
The hummus is excellent as well as all of their fresh pitas and breads
For two, I recommend getting only one pitza and two appetizers; it should be enough for a man and woman
If not full, you can get the rice pudding for dessert, which is excellent also
Great place
Romantic, inexpensive and scaled down
Many European customers
Though the decor isn't much, the food is great for the price
Everything we had was delicious
As a middle easterner, i am always looking for cute places with great hummus, this one is definatley on the list!
Lamb merguez sandwich can not be beat, and the falafel is great, too
Nothing is too heavy here, though it'll fill you right up
Great backyard patio is one of the most peaceful spots in the neighborhood
It's a little pricier than the average falafel place, but worth it
great fries and sandwiches, they deliver if your in the east village
Creative mayo dips too!
This place is truly a jewel in EV
Its tiny store front is a tip of iceberg, the garden in the backyard is HUGE
It is excellent for Summer and Autumn night sitting out, great for groups or good friends gathering
The food is truly tasty for the very reasonable price
This is not one of those chi chi, highly decorated I-talian restaurants in the city, however, the food is certainly on top notch
If you want some home made Italian pasta and other dishes, definitely check it out
Went because of friends recommendation - went BACK because it was such great food
The outside garden is fantastic for brunch
though they could use better lighting at night
still -- all in all one of my favorite italian places in the village
everything is fresh and home cooked
Steaks for $16 -- how crazy is that?! lol Highly recommend -- great date place
whenever friends come into town, this is one of the places that I take them to eat, the garden is always full of light banter and laughter and the owner takes care that the sauces and quality of food is high in quality
The portions are generous and the waitstaff is attentive and pleasant
Best of all, when you leave your wallet is happy that you chose this restaurant
I have lived in the area for 30 years and this is one of the best
Across the street, Venieros is pleasant for coffee and Italian pastry, if there is any room left
Brunetta's is a real rarity in NYC,a restaurant that gives you great, fresh, inventive food at prices that are bargains, even for the East Village
Pasta's, stock for sauces and desserts (please,leave room, if only to share) are made in house
When the weather gets warmer you can have all of the above and a lovely outside garden too! One of my absolute favorites
I've been a customer of Brunetta's for 7 years and a happy one
I've lived in the E
V
for 12 years and have seen so many places come and go
Brunettas is a staple because of it's honesty, integrity and simplicity
It's the type of place real East Villagers go to for real comfort and value
This is the best food and the most charming setting in the East Village
The outdoor garden is so relaxing, and in combination with the terrific food, its my favorite place in the City
Starting out with hot, homeade frocotia most entrees are followed by a fresh salad with a unique dressing
All entrees are fresh and delicious
My favorite is the salmon, accompanied by fresh vegtables, cooked to order
I eat here at least 3 times per week
Orologio is a great little restaurant
The food is absolutely outstanding and the service is really good
The restaurant is cute and great for a date, not great for large parties as its a small restaurant
All of the pastas we tried were delicous and the antipasta appetizer was very good
Yep, a lot of clocks (many beautiful antique ones), but no need to watch the time
The food is consistently delicious and fresh, this coming from an Italian born and raised in the tradition of putting only the best on the table
Brunch at $7 is a steal (try the french toast made with Italian panettone)
The sevice is remarkable and the owner (also owner of Cafe Pick Me Up on East 9th) is often there to oversee things
Judging from the other reviews, the quality in this restaurant has not changed a bit in a long time
I think consistency is the best attribute a food business can have
One last note to comment on the nice selection of wines, the home made tiramisu and the relaxing atmosphere
Good music
Restrooms always clean, but could be prettier
we go here so much that the waitstaff practically knows our order before we make it
always the same dishes: gnocci, lasagna, and the chicken/artichoke pasta
we just have to say which we want
the staff is so friendly, on-top of things at all times, amazing hot food, romantic
the only issue is that the tables are a bit wobbly and should be replaced
otherwise, it's the best place in the east village for amazing food
Orologio is definately a restaurant worth checking out
Whether for a romantic dinner or simply a relaxing drink, the service and food are both first rate
It also doesnt' hurt that the prices are bohemian, in other words really inexpensive
I discovered Orologio restaurant 3 years ago, when I moved to the East Village
Since then, I have become a regular
The food is simply delicious
Besides the seasonal menu, the chef always prepares daily specials, and sometimes if you have a particular request, he will satisfy your cravings with a custom-made dish
This makes me feel right at home (sorry Mom)
I like the fact that Orologio is for everyone, in that, I see people of all ages, backgrounds, and nationalities, as the menu fits a large spectrum of budgets and tastes
I have met the executive chef (Made in Italy), who combines true Italian cuisine with some local elements (like brunch)
During the summertime, people in our neighborhood stop by the kitchen (which faces the sidewalk), to see what is cooking, or simply to say hello
I personally recommend the homemade pastas, panini, chocolate fondue, and the brunch
The service here is very accomodating, attentive, and quick
We consistently had new bread on our table before we even realized we were almost done with our basket
The food isn't the best Italian I've had, but far from the worst
The variety of the menu was quite good
I'd definitely recommend this place
The waitstaff went out of their way to create a space for us to sit
The eggplant parmasean was AWESOME (I don't even like eggplant) but my main course was just ok (shrimp with pasta)
The service was a little slow
I would go back
I can't imagine eating pasta or risotto in other place than the Orologio
Maybe lots of the so called Italian restaurants have similar menues, but for sure they don't have the same quality
You have to try it to know what I am talking about

Great food and service
Everyone here extremely helpfull and friendly
Their coupons are exceptional
it started out as a 'pizza place' many years ago, but as most of the good ones do it grew into a good italian restaurant! the food is very good and the specials change often to keep ya thinking
the service is good and the menu is just what you'd expect with the specials even better
check it out but i cant narrow down what to order cause Ive always had v good food from pastas to fish!
I have been going to Rosa's since was 3yrs old
After 28 yrs
and moving out of the area, I still go all the way back to Maspeth and get my craving for their sicilian pizza fulfilled! Every friend, boyfriend and visiting relatives have been turned onto Rosa's
My father's first request when he comes here is to go to Rosa's! I have brought their pizza on my flights to Florida because my sister who has moved can't live w/o it! They have been in Queens for about 28yrs and they have a huge following-ask any cop,cab driver or anyone who drives all around the city which pizzeria they love-they always say Rosa's on 69th st!
This pizzeria is one of the best kept secrets Queens
I have been going there since I was in my moms belly
This is a family run business, all of their locations has a brother (there are 9 of them) and It is the best Pizzeria, they make their own sauce (Mother's secret recepie), their own dough, and about 20 varieties of pizza
Wether you want a Regular Slice, their DELICIOUS marinara sicilian, or one of their specialty pizzas like Chicken Parm, Ravioli, or Taco pizza once you eat a Rosas Pizza you will never go anywhere else
They are also expanding; they have 2 locations in Midtown (not the one in Penn Station) serveral in Queens and Long Island
My favorite is the 69th Street Location (the Flag Ship
) Stop by any one of these great pizzerias and Eat the best Pizza in NYC
the sicilian has been great since i was in grammar school 30 yrs ago, and the 'regular' comes in all the popular styles and is just as good
I bought a cake for $150
The owner of the bakery went on the website while I was ordering to make sure he knew what cake I wanted
When I got the cake it wasn't what I ordered
I called the bakery and asked how much the cake I received cost,they told me $90
00-$120
00
I emailed the bakery and told them my situation,the owner(which at first didn't say he was the owner)told me that he had to see the receipt and told me to call back
When I called back he lied, he said he took the order and the reciept said nothing about the cake that I wanted
He did nothing to make the situation right
He did everything to indicate that he didn't care,his money was made
I had intentions on using them again if everything turned out ok,too bad they haven't realized that if you keep your customers happy they will return
Clueless
Fantatic food, resonable prices, wonderful service
The menu is vast, combo plates are a great deal
Portions are sizeable
You can't make a bad choice
Everything is tasty
Family owned been around a long time
Restaurant is very clean
In all a great choice for eat in or take out
Li Wan is definitely the best Chinese place in the area! You can dine-in, take-out or even ask for delivery
There's a reason why Li Wan is still a local favorite for over 20 years
Also, if you always get the same thing, don't be afraid to try new things on the menu
Pretty much everthing I've tried is very tasty
and as for the prices, very reasonable
Li Wan's is not your average Take-Out chinese restaurant
I have been eating at this family owned chinese restaurant for about 4 years now, and it is definitely the best in the neighborhood
Li Wan's offers a spacious dine-in area but also delivers very promptly
The menu offers the standard and not so standard Chinese cuisine at an unbeatable price
Great food Great service Worth a trip to this hidden treasure!!!
Salvatore's is a quaint little italian restaurant hidden away on a quiet street in Middle Village
Basically a home has been converted into a restaurant
This home though has great italian cooking
Although the dining area is a bit small you'll feel at home as the owner is very friendly and talkative
I grew up on this pizza, been going there since the late 60s when they opened
I have never been disappointed with any food I have had there
The sauce has just the right amount of spice, the cheese is always flowing and gooey
The crust is always crispy
All around the best pizza in town
I've been to pizza restaurants in nearly every state in the union
I've been to pizza places all over Italy, and speaking as an Italian, Carlo's is hands down the greatest pizza on Earth
If you want cheap, low quality, massive amounts of horrible pizza to feed a bunch of ungreatful 10 year olds, look elsewhere
Carlo's pizza is fresh, tasty, and is made in the finest tradition of New York pizza, just like my  father made in his old pizza parlor when he first came to America
Carlos Pizza is the best in NY
I live in Fishkill now and whenever I am in Middle Village, my husband and kids always want to go to Carlos for Pizza
Delicioso!!
the place is small but everything else is 'big' in terms of quality variety and smiles of the wait service
the entrees on the chalk board strut but even the 'basics' on the menu are done just right! expect to wait a little cause no one wants it to end
ps - he's opening a new location about 2 blocks towards metro ave so maybe they'll be more tables and more happy eaters! also i forgot to mention the music - dean martin, jerry vale
The people at the bar actually spoke Italian
The food was excellent, better than Carmine's - could hold its own against any Italian restaurant in Manhattan
Having gone to Zum's for over twenty years, it amazes me that the food and service continue to shine
From what started as a ninnocent date there, they have lured me to continue my visits to the point of bringing groups of twenty plus
I have never once been diappointed with anything
(other than the fact that you can only get the spaeztle on tuesdays,lol)
I've been coming here for over 4 years and leave full and happy every time! Amazing waitresses, amazing food and amazing beer! The food may seem overpriced but it's worth the money
Their home fries are to DIE for! If it's your birthday, they come with a cake and a candle and sing Happy Birthday to you
Spent quite a few evenings enjoying the best of German cuisine, chased down by endless steams of beer
The food is sublime - from simple brauts to more exotic hunter's stew
Delicious! The desserts are also great
Don't forget to get some iced cold schnapps! Goes down easy packs a wallop
Comments about the ski lodge are right on target
It's from another country, and even another era
The waitress couldn't do enough for us
She was quite Germanic, however
Some of her recommendations were no nonsense
What she said, goes!
As one other reviewer said, ski lodge in Germany
This place is great
Food is good, not overcooked
Don't forget to ask for the 1 liter beers too
Zum Stammtisch rules
That's all I have to say
It is the greatest restaurant in Queens and all of NYC for that matter
It's a bit far away for those fancy Manhattan people to find and thank god for it! Awesome ambience: you feel like you're in a ski lodge in Germany, excellent food: I can never grow tired of the viener schnitezel, and of course the beer
I've been at least 10 times already
Zum Stammtisch owns my soul
Forget the airfare
Skip the hotel reservations
Zum serves some of the best German food anywhere, perhaps even in Germany
This is as authentic a German eatery as you will find in NY

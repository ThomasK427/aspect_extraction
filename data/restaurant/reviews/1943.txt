Will definitely not go back again
My wife and I visited L'Ecole two years ago since we live in the neighborhood, are both foodies and wanted to support a local culinary school
We were horrified by the poor service we received from the host to the server
We recently had friends in town who insisted on going
Not only was the inside of the restaurant renovated, more importantly we couldn't have been more impressed with the service that was provided from the minute we walked in the door
The Restaurant Manager, Scott guided us through our menu and wine pairings and we were extremely pleased with each thoughtful choice
Our server, Matt was warm and inviting while extremely professional
To cap off our last evening there the manager made us reservations for Lupa the next night after we told him we were dying to get in there for dinner! What an experience!
The most outstanding aspect of our meal was the incredible, attentive service from our totally friendly and very knowledgeable waiter
His mastery of the wine list was pretty astounding considering he is probably not a day over 21
When I ordered my pork loin, he explained the preparation to make sure I would be satisfied
Our appetizers were also excellentl; the foie gras pate was a standout and opened my appetite rather than filling me up prematurely
We were so pleasanly surprised that I guess we made delightful dinner guests, since the maitre'd treated us to post-dinner dessert wine
Tip: the rack of lamb is outstanding and goes perfectly with their excellent Cabernet
Make sure to leave room for dessert, as Jacques Torres's imprint is everywhere
Best part? The price
Our delicious four course meal, with dessert, multiple glasses of fantastic wine and after dinner coffee, was under $90
Everything was very good
The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgable
The food was the perfect amount and very good
The ONLY negative thing I could possible say, was that my lamb was slightly dry, but still tastey
Overall I would definately recommend this place, it is an incredible deal
Meals can vary from acceptable to very original but Flavour is the leitmotiv
Great deserts
Great wines
Professional staff
- food : great (the best I ate in NY) - service : it's ok  - price: it worth it !!! it's very cheap for a 5 courses menu this quality ! - the menu changes everyday, with 3 choices for each course
There's no a la carte menu
So choose your reservation the day when the menu is convenient for you ! there's a website
- I heard that sometimes the food and the service isn't great : it depends which students are on duty !!! But I never had a bad experience here
- it's always full then sometimes you have to wait a little bit
I was surprised by the southwest influence in my meal since I assumed everything would be traditional French food
It was a great meal
Excellent, friendly service, delicious food and an overall unbelievably rare value! Run!
Great French food thats reasonably priced and served in a low-key setting
Its not a huge space, but its quite and perfect for catching up with friends
Surprised by the negative reviews since we had a great dinner
Food was good and very reasonable
Its a quiet place thats great for lingering over dinner with friends
Good French food hard to believe its prepared by students
Also glad to see there are places in NYC where you can get a good meal at an affordable price
The restaurant looks good but the food and the service there isn't all that good
I don't think it was worth it for the money i paid to be treated like that when i just wanted a min more to decide what to get
Lousy waitress gave me a attitude and it made my whole evening go down the drain
The food isn't all that great and i dunno y zagat gave it such a great review
I wouldn't recommend u go there because they don't treat every customer there right
I think they look at ur color rather then ur wallet
I too was very disappointed in L'Ecole since Zagat gave it a good rating
The service was just terrible
The host waitresses had a strange unfriendly attitude - even the bartender
I just couldn't believe it
The food was not good at all
It's not worth spending money here
But it's a quiet place to chat
L'Ecole is the best restaurant, value or otherwise
the food is fun and delicious and I love this place! Everyone should try it at least once
the food was so-so, we expected it to be better because zagat gave a pretty high ranking on food quality
the service was terrible, we didn't even greeted when we came in
the waiters were awkward and clumsy
they didn't even bother to refill our glass of water
there are other better french restaurants in the city
Jaya is one of my favourite restaurants in chinatown
food is just superb! the serving is pretty big and price is just so inexpensive
i do agree with the comment about their waitstaff, they tend to make you feel like you have to rush through your meal
i guess it's because there are a lot of people waiting to be seated
must try though!
I was walking around Chinatown when I noticed this spot, tucked away on the sidestreet of Baxter
People say the ambience isn't too great, but I think it's quite nice compared to most Chinatown restaurants
It has sort of an islandy feel, with bamboo chairs, wide open spaces and a large tropical fish tank
My only complaint would be the service
My waitress rushed me to order, never asked me how my meal was or if I needed a napkin
The water was warm, which didn't go well with my spicy dish
The food is absolutely fantastic and cheap! I got an entire dinner for $7, and had more than plenty of leftovers
It took entirely too long to get the check and they don't accept credit cards on bills less than $10
It's definitely worth sacrificing great service for a great meal at even greater prices
Wonderful Malaysian food!  They have a huge varity of dishes - great value for the amount of food you get and the quality!  Love this place
Whenever I visit New York, I will make it a point to stop by Jaya
However, we are very disappointed that the food quality has dropped
The char kway teow is dry and the noodle used was not the soft chinese type
The pophia was the worst
The filling tasted stale
Seafood chow fun (our special order) was very starchy
You can imagine our disappointment especially having driven all the way from Philly
In any case, to give them credit on others, their mee goreng is pretty good
If spicy food agrees with your stomach, dig into some of the popular dishes such as Homemade Roti Canai (crispy Indian pancake that comes with a thick curry sauce), Malaysian Lemon Grass Satay (BBQ chicken or beef skewers with peanut sauce), Curry Seafood Noodle Soup (be prepared to ask for water refills), and Beef Rendang over rice
Try the Steamed Carp Chew Chow Style, Crabs With Spicy Sauce, finger-licking Butter Shrimp, Grilled Stingray Fish in Banana Leaf, and Cashew Chicken in Taro Cake
Youll be glad you came with a big party, otherwise youll be stuffed to the hilt!
This was our first stop in a search for Malaysian food on a recent trip to NYC
My wife is Malay and this is the only restaurant that we went back to
roti Chanai is great, except the Roti bread reminded me more of a crepe than Malaysian Roti
We tried as many of the dishes as we could, the Beef Rendang is nice and tasty but needed more coconut milk
The place reminded me of some of the places in Kuala Lumpur, pots and pans stacked to the ceiling
Of all the Malaysian REstaurants in NYC this one does the best job of being authentic
Also try their many tropical drinks, I loved the watermelon and my wife had to have what the Malays call ABC
Malaysian cuisine is not for the spice-oh-phobic but some dishes had enough kick and bite to make it passable for delicate tasters
I always bring dates and friends to this off Canal Street eatery for the reasonably priced fare
Get the Tom Yum Soup, Hinanese Chicken, Beef Rendang ang the noodle dishes
Make sure you order the ABC dessert (no letters in it but just delightful shaved ice with tidbits of sweet jellies) and the Malaysian Coffee (their version of Thai Tea with cream) to ensure your tastebuds won't burn afterwards
The cliche'd ambiance and scary restroom is a small price to pay for great eats in Chinatown
The food here is soooo good

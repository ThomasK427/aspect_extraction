it's bangin and it melts in your mouth
This is what original good food is all about!!
seems many restaurants old new are putting more $ into looks than into genuine good ole chinese cooking (old ones with facelifts, new ones opening fancier interiors)
rather pay for a good ho-down chinese than for the decor dishes
so wo hop is one of the few remaining that hangs on to the past
tho we all have to expect prices to be higher than before
downstairs you can't be antsy about cleanliness or expect courteous svc
upstairs is more comfortable ordering is quick (they do want turnover)
food is still good after all these years
try their famous roasted 'squab' (no they don't use nyc pigeons!)
SUM IT: You can try the other expensive fancier places, but if you miss this you won't be missed as this place has it's own following
Price, taste, variety - like to eat chinese then you must go
OUTSTANDING FOOD AND VERY REASONABLE PRICES
GREAT SOUPS AND CANTONESE DISHES
BEST WONTON SOUP IN TOWN
EXCELLENT NOODLE AND RICE DISHES
ATMOSHPHERE AND AMBIANCE LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED
NOT ON VALENTINES DAY OR A BIRTHDAY, BUT EVERY OTHER DAY OF THE YEAR IS FINE
Wo where is the Hop this place was like a meat market
Your rushed through your whole meal I don't even remember if I swallowed
What you need to do is Hop across the street to Hop Lee's if you want good eat
Although this place has been around forever, the food is predictable and boring
There are so many other wonderful Chinese restaurants in New York
I actually crave it when I am out of town! This is the place to eat --the won ton soup is out of this world
Sometimes there is a wait, but it is always worth it
The service is wonderful and always comes with compliments (the call me the next miss america!) If you're ever in the city, make sure you stop in
This is without a doubt the BEST Chinese food for the money
The food is very affordable and the service is quick
Expect to wait on the weekends out in the street (or on the stairs)
As long as you are not spooked by cramped seating areas you'll love this place
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Wo Hop serves up some of the tastiest Chinese food around
The restaurant has two parts: upstairs is a typical Chinatown restaurant, while downstairs is a cafeteria style: Fun, noisy and cramped
The portions are genorous and the prices low (and T-Shirts are only $5)! You have heard about it on TV, now experience it in person (NY police shows reference it all the time)
Don't be fooled by the fact that you have to go downstairs into a basement to eat
Don't be fooled by the cramped conditions
Don't be fooled by the hurried, impatient waiters
This is the only place in Chinatown to eat
The other places may have more space, better lighting, and nicer staff, but Wo Hop's has the best food
And if incredible food at cut rate prices is what you want, get in line and enjoy the best Chinatown has to offer
its the best alll around goood what do u think maybe
This place is one of those looks can be deceiving places
I love the food and is totally worth the effort to get there
Excellent food
Fantastic prices
Service comes above and beyond the call of duty
Love the pictures, they really add a great atmosphere
There is no better chinese dining in New York
Oh man what could I say about Wo Hop, I've been going there since I was a young lad
I wanted my Bar Mitzvah there but the Rabbi wouldn't pray over the Pork Lo Mein
I wanted to have my wedding there but, 150 year old granny couldn't make it down the stairs
What could I say the food is great, even though the sign in the Mens Room says Employee's Must Wash @$$
One thing is for sure when you Down at Wo's you won't come back up, and your wallet won't lose any weight either
oh and by the way, cash only, the downside, no frequent flyer points earned by eating at Wo's
I love this place
The waiterd are a little stuffy but they always take time for my 5 yo son and talk to him
The food is prepared as specially ordered
I have many times at Wo Hop since 1961
I have seen the place go from no english menus through 3 redecorations
Some of the wait staff were teenagers like myself when I first started eating there while in high school
Now they are elders like me
Best won ton soup in the world! I have travelled extensively and can make this statement truthfully
Better won ton than China towns in SanFancisco or L
A

Enjoy! Great ribs and chow fun too
one of the better chinese in the city
If you are into ambiance go across the street and pay twice as much
House special Lo Mein is a favorite
the food was great and plentiful
i enjoyed the ambienece or lack thereof as well!
Love Wo Hop! Downstairs is the place to be
Where else can you order your takeout and be served a Tsing Tao beer on the house while you wait? And if you go in the wee hours, you can watch everyone making dumplings from scratch! GREAT FUN!
Wo! was it cheap
Dinner for 8 of us was around $95 dollars and we ordered 7 appetizers, soup and 5 entrees including one lobster dish
Sesame noodles were very good and different, not the thick peanuty sauce I am used to
The dumplings and ribs were devoured and the string beans in garlic sauce were fresh and spicy
Not a lot of choices for vegetarians but what I ate was yummy
I would also say that this isnt the best place to go with more than 4 people and certainly not if you are looking for any ambiance
My family has enjoyed eating at Wo Hop for over 20 years
This is not haute cuisine, but the food is tasty and cheap
Chinese Soul Food
Nothing has changed there for as long as I can remember (e
g
- menu, prices, decor, waitstaff
)
It's just a fun place for cheap, no frills eating
Wo Hops (Make sure you go to the one in the basement, not the one upstairs
Theres a huge difference) is one of the best noodle places in the city and offers some great NYC Chinatown Chinese food
This is not tradional chinese fare
Trust me, after annual trips to Hong Kong, there is a huge difference in taste between legit chinese food and the stuff we eat here
Wo Hops is packed every hour of the day
Usual clientelle are cops, EMT's, city workers, regulars, and kids looking for late night eats after a night of partying
That said, sit down, ask for the chop sticks, and order some Chow Fun and enjoy
Its not a pretty place, but is consistently on everyone top 10 list for a reason; the food
after reading great reviews for wo hop, i decided to give it a try
but when you enter this dingy hole-in-the wall, you will not find a trace of chopsticks on the tables, nor a chinese character on the menu
the closest thing they've got to that are the souvenir t-shirts on sale by the register
sorry guys, but every single person you will find in this resteraunt besides the staff is anything but asian
not so reassuring
the food is greasy and mediocre

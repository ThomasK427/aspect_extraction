The pleasant staff is well-informed, though usually swamped; Moby himself frequently stops by to spread the love
The Food Though primarily a teahouse--more than 93 hot teas are served, plus iced blends, tea-and-fruit purees and coolers--Teany also offers a fresh, inventive vegetarian and vegan menu in generous portions
Most items put a delicious twist on the traditional: The Welsh rarebit uses beer and mustard instead of Worcestershire sauce; one sandwich boasts mock ham and cheese; and the Middle Eastern sampler features smooth white-bean hummus and quinoa tabbouleh
Varied muffins, cakes and pies are so tasty, you'll never guess which ones are vegan
This place is very small, but lucky for us, there were few tables with patrons on this Saturday afternoon
I think that's why we were so disappointed when we ordered one type of scone and received the type we didn't order! Well, rather than make a fuss, we just ate the ones we were given (lemon poppyseed)
They were very good, however, so I can't really complain about it
The service was otherwise decent
The tea selection is very good - this is a cute, modern tearoom indeed
I have to say, the best part about Teany was seeing Moby
Okay, got that out of my system
Teany is a great little shop with a wide selection of quality teas
Whether your fancy be green tea to coconut flavored tea, Teany is the place to be
Great for people watching, resting your feet and grabbing a bite to eat
I can't decide between sitting outdoors or indoors
Outdoors offers the great opportunity to people-watch while indoors you get to groove to Moby's electic mix of cafe-appropriate music
An excellent, polite waitstaff transforms the tiny space from something potentially chaotic into something pleasant
Definately worth a try
Special teas to sip and scrumptious vegan goodies, salads and sandwiches to enjoy while sitting in a (covered) warm, outdoor cafe - what could be better on a sunny, cold afternoon on the lower east side! Plus, I could buy all of my holiday gifts at teany :)
Great teas, great food, great people scene
Service is excellent, not over-priced
This is a wonderful place for true tea lovers
It is not a good place for large groups but great when taking a break with one or two friends
Their food is also very delicious to go with tea
They also have nice decoration and overall a relaxing place to be
I had afternoon tea with a friend of mine a few months ago at Teany
Another friend of mine had given me the thumbs up concerning the place, so I decided it would be a nice place to catch up with an old friend, and I was really impressed
I'm not a vegetarian, but I thought the menu had a nice variety of veggie choices that anyone, including me, could enjoy
My friend and I ordered the afternoon tea, and the sandwiches were amazing, and the scones are some of the best I've ever had (I used to live in Scotland, so I've eaten a lot of scones while having tea)
The petit fours were a bit deranged looking, but they tasted great
their presentation just needed a little work
I highly suggest coming down to the LES to check this place out
It's definitely worth the commute
Yes portions are small but the food is fresh and delicious
The prices are reasonable
We went on a saturday and expect to wait a little for a table
Sitting outside is defintely an option
I will be back
This place is awesome
you must get the tea for one or tea for two, if you have a friend with you
You get 2 sandwiches each (out of a choice of like 5) cut into little triangles, crust cut off, a scone each with butter and jam, and petit-fours (minature desserts) all served on a three tiered tray
You also get your choice of 4 teas
one pot per person! Tea for two is only $28! And it is a generous portion of food
You leave there full but not stuffed
It is amazing!!!!!!!!! Even my boyfriend liked it!
We try to get here every few weeks for the delicious teas, scones and finger sandwiches
I'm far from vegan, but I still love the food here
Whenever I feel like I need a break from meat, I think of Teany first
The Earl Grey Creme tea rocks and after downing a pot each of it, we purchase a tin to take home
perhaps I stumbled upon the wrong and counterfeit Teany while looking for the real one because value is not accurate here
I had vegan chicken salad that wasn't bad, but I could have made it at home, and eaten a lot more, and not paid $9 for it
They do have a lot of tea
and the vegan cheesecake was excellent
In NYC, where dinner typicly follows sticker-shock, Teany is a great place for a good, unique meal that leaves you feeling satisfied and your wallet feeling full
Try the tea service (just $14 includes a pot of tea, tea sandwiches, warm scone, dessert, and other goodies), and come by yourself or with a friend
Teany isn't good for big groups
teany is just that: teeny; however, teany is a really cute place to go on a date
i went there with a guy that i was dating, and he absolutely loved it! it's even great for individuals like myself who are making a transition from being a carnivore to becoming a vegetarian/vegan
the service is kinda slow, but this could be seen as a plus, if you're the type to linger over a meal and good conversation
I just recently visited Teany for the third time, and I have to say its quickly turning into my favorite vegan spot in the city
The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, the soups are tasty but by far the best thing about Teany has to be the highly addictive vegan turkey club sandwhich
My goal is to try all 96 teas they serve there, so I guess I'll have to visit another 93 times!
This is a great place for a nice relaxing and light lunch (go during the weekday)
Amazing vegan/vegetarian soups, sandwiches and desserts
Simple food without being bland
The tea selections are a bit overwhelming
you usually wind up ordering your food first before you decide on a tea
Refreshing summer teas, cozy spot
Great lunchtime afternoon tea spot with a friend, can order a combo of various finger sandwiches
Clean spare spot, service does tend towards the slow side
Caught a glimpse of Moby
Can be very crowded on the weekends, hard to find a seat then
Good place for afternoon weekday tea
This place is adorable and the food is good enough to satisfy even meateaters
The fake turkey club is really good and the crostini spreads are original and delicious
There are so many tasty tea drinks that it's hard to choose
Also, the service is fine, outdoor seating is a plus, and it's inexpensive
I'll definitely go back for more
I went here with my boyfriend (a meat eater) and he REALLY likes to have his meat, so he didn't enjoy as much as I did
But I had the Turkey Club sandwich and IT WAS SO GOOD
The bacon and turkey tasted like real turkey
the bread was perfect
Another time I had the goat cheese sandwich but it was too tiny
hardly enough filling and mostly bread taste
eh
I did try their Chocolate Peanut Butter Bomb though
I CANNOT believe that dessert is Vegan
it's so PLEASURABLE
I even ordered one to go home with!! I'm going back there tomorrow just for the dessert and turkey club
Ever since my first trip to england, I have lamented America's lack of appreciation for tea
The first time I went to Teany changed my opinion forever
Teany proves that there are a growing number of New Yorkers at least who understand the pleasure of sitting for hours over a drink that seems so simple, yet can be so incredibly satisfying when done right
Teany is the absolute best tea house I've been to in the country, and it vies with the best in GB as well
Oh, and the food and wait staff are absolutely fabulous as well!
This is my favorite veggie place in the city
The teas are great, but the real lure for me is the food
Afternoon tea special with finger sandwiches is outstanding
The scones are sweet and the ham and cheese sandwich is rich and filling
The best dessert is the peanut butter bomb with smooth whipped peanut butter over a rich chocolate cake
Yum! It's a small place, and it can get crowded, but the cuteness makes up for that

This is exactly what the message left on the receipt stated! The restuarant was not busy, yet took 10 minutes for our server to arrive and take drink orders
Half way through the meal my husband had to go to the bar to order his own beer, since the server never came back
Food was OK- but not outstanding
This is the worst dining experience the city has to offer
My wife is a big fan of Mesa Grill - brunch and dinner - so we decided to check them out for brunch
Mind you, I've had dinner here before (w/o her) and I thought it was pretty good
Brunch was excellent - but maybe it's because I'm a s*cker for breakfast food
First off, if you are going to do the seafood sampler, go for the tasting trio
The crab, shrimp and lobster is very fresh and the condiments that are each paired with are perfectly suited for each
The trio portions are large and you can't beat the $19 price - I thought it was a great value
I had a very nice American Onion Soup - sweet Vidalias, cheddar and a nice crouton
For main entrees, she had a grilled pizza with garlic and big pieces of bacon - I thought it was good, she said it was great
I had one of my all-time favorite dishes - Biscuit with Sausage and Gravy
Whenever I travel for business down south, I always get this at the $7 buffett breakfasts
At BA it was just as good - large, bacon soaked biscuits, nice sausage and thick, creamy gravy
Great dish! Overall, we now have another spot to go for a wonderful Sunday brunch
My wife and I went on a whim back in November 2005 and loved every minute of it! Chef Flay was in the kitchen this night and his wife was dining with friends at one of the larger tables near the kitchen
We were seated after a 15 minute wait at the bar
Salads were great and the entrees were wonderful
Wife had a chicken special and I had the pork chop
Then, we had dinner again on July 1, 2006
Did not disappoint
The wait staff was better the second time around and our water glasses were always full
The waitress recommended a fabulous bottle of wine and again, the wife had a BBQ chicken dish and I had the pork
Both were wonderful
It was very relaxing and enjoyable the second time around
My Husband and I went to Bar Amercain last night and I can honestly say nothing about the place made me want to go back
The service was probably the best part of the meal other than that everything was pretty so-so
I had the pizza appetizer, it was awful, I make a better bobboli, way way too much oil, the raw bar sampler was the other app
we order - it was good
My dinner a rack of pork, no rack it really was chop and was tough, my husband had the lamb - good but nothing stellar
In the end I didn't want to even try for a dessert but my hubby made me
We had the Carmel bourbon clairs they were quite tasty, but not good enough for a 2nd trip
Definitely can say expected a better meal than what was served
It's a great space; very attractive
The service was stellar
Our 10 year old daughter ordered steak without the spice rub; it came with it though
We sent it back, but I tasted it first and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had
The spinach side also arrived quite cold, and it was pretty tasteless
But everything else was very good
They sent over a dessert assortment on the house to make up for the steak mistake, and it was great
I'd sum it up as very good food with the kind of service that makes you want to come back because you know they care and they'll make sure you have a good experience
The food is great - a unique twist on American food
The decor is really cool - nice mood lighting in here
Bobby Flay, for all of his TV fame lately was actually there, and working - not just waltzing around the dining room
Sommelier was awesome - I asked for a good bottle of wine to go with my meal that wasnt expensive and he stayed right in my price target - and his pick was delicious
Waitress was good - only annoying thing she did was whenever I had a question about a dish she liked to tell me what Bobby does with the filet or What Bobby likes to do with the lobster is
it sounded so cheesy - like she was trying hard to suck me into some Food Network fantasy or something
The place was bustling at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night- we arrived earlier than our reservation and got situated at the bar
THe bartendars were right on top of getting us our wine and setting up free blue cheese dip and chips for us
Had pleasant conversation and a little extra wine for our wait for the table at no extra charge
Now there's customer service!! Food was not as good as i expected but it was tasty
The desserts were amazing! Service was excellent
The place was loud but not so loud you couldn't have a conversation
A very energetic place, lots of people working to please you
After my food disaster at celeb Mario Batali's restaurant Babo, I was weary about eating a Bobby Flay's new spot
It seems that so many food celebrities are all show and the food suffers
But Bobby Flay really steps up at Bar Americain--his passion and heart shine through the food
My friend and I decided to go for Brunch
I ordered eggs layered between blue corn chips, with black beans and a perfectly ripe avocado salsa
drizzled with two types of chile sauces
It was nothing short of delicious
The service was excellent
I spotted a hair in my dish and they immediately replaced it and comped me
The bread basket is exquisite--so comforting and unusual featuring a very special corn/jalapeno/cheese butter! I highly recommend this place
No pretenion, just excellent food
Sorry, if you gave this place a bad review then you should stick to fast food places
A truly great dining experience
From entering the door to leaving everything was perfect
Classic food with truly top notch professional service in a striking decor
Great from appetizer to dessert including a wonderfully created vegetarian plate that is not on the menu
A must go for anyone that loves to eat and enjoy the whole dining experience
Typical Flay with stellar service in a brilliant room
My pal popped for a weekday outing and we got the crazy idea of ordering the unbelievable double-decker shellfish platter
The restaurant's patrons stopped and looked when it was brought to our table
Totally worth the sixty or so bucks
Only problem was that there was so much eating from the platter that I ran out of room for an entree
Open kitchen and cool bar
Kind of a weird neighborhood with Times Square so close, but this place is excellent
Visiting on Christmas Eve for lunch, upon entering we were impressed with the decor and seated immediately
We enjoyed the drinks (try the BT!) and the great breads
The 3 Taste seafood sampler (shrimp, crab lobster) was excellent and a good value
The smoked chicked pot pie was delicious, as was the perfectly seasoned and prepared burger, and frites fans will not be disappointed
The service was very helpful, and we were never rushed
We wish we'd had room for dessert! We'll definitely be back!
For years, Midtown has been a bit of a desert when it comes to great restaurants that aren't $500 a person
That has changed! I have dined at Bar Americain numerous times now, and each time has been lovely and flawless
Big bold food, happy professional and knowledgable staff, and gorgeous decor
Not to mention I can promise you this is the only celeb chef restaurant where you will actually see the chef much of time time! This is a real New York fine dining experience for those who seek such things
It is, though, a serious restuarant for serious diners
I have seen people around me get surprisingly upset to find out that they can't rewrite the menu or other such nonsense
But for those of us who go out to have professionals create a beautiful experience for us
than Bar Americain is the place for you!
I have dined here before and the experience was FLAWLESS! It was the complete opposite experience this time
Terrible service mediocre food
It took 15 minutes before the waiter even took our drink orders
Once he finally took our dinner order, he was never to been seen again until I had to grab his attention to order another cocktail half way through dinner
Never checked back to see if the appetizers were satisfactory or even our entrees
Not even when we placed additional drink orders did he inquire about the meal
It took about 20 minutes before anyone cleared our dishes once we were done

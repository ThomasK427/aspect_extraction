It is just a great place to chill
morning
noon and night
And the coffee and food is delicious
I use frequent a few places around the city and no other place compares with 71 Irvin
After only attending this place a few times over a couple of weeks, the morning staff (Mario, Meg, and the two cute boys Rony and Tobias) addresses me by name and have my coffee ready to go by the time I#146;ve walked to the register
It is the only place I know that has dependable service with character
It is also a great place to people watch
They have a lot of beautiful clientele, gay and straight, plus you#146;ll spot random famous actors on occasion
71 Irving Place (formerly 52 Irving Place) has fantastic baked goods, exceptional coffee, and friendly staff
The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy, and there is always a gathering of neighborhood dogs outside
I walk six blocks every Saturday and Sunday for my favorite '71' cup of Joe now, but I'd twenty-six if I had to
Cozy, intimate atmosphere
Excellent coffee, tea, and food
Immaculate, hip cafe with charming staff
This is THE place to be for coffee and tea
71 Irving is the most consistent and pleasant coffee/snack shoppe around
They have the best cup of java in the city
hands down! Thank you for giving this neighborhood what every well deserving new yorker needs
a real cuppa java
71 Irving's coffee is not only delicious but also consistently delicious
That means each and every time, it does not disappoint
And that goes for decaf, too -- not an easy feat!
Awesome cafe, delightful ambiance, best-cup- of-coffee, wonderful selections and choices!!, always busy but still excellent customer service--helpful,courteous and friendly
A neat contribution to the neighborhood with a pleasant community atmosphere
I am always anxious to return for the next cup!!!!!
My hectic days cannot begin until I decend down into my favorite brownstown cafe at 71 Irving Place
many of my neighbors and friends share the same view
Great decor with even better pastries and coffees
I stick with their many blends and have never tasted any better than this
and I've been in the coffee trade for over fifty years!!! 71 is that special place where you feel like sharing with everyone
Since moving to the city 3 years ago, this has been my constant source of caffeine in the morning
They were great when they were 52 and they're even better now
crowded but fun
good people watching
great coffee and bagels
a little attitude, but that's New York
Makes all pale in comparison
Coffee, treats, and the best of eerything
I recently read that this place had the best coffee in the city, so I decided to try it
It really was delicious, strong but not bitter and it really wakes you up
Not only is it the nicest atmosphere with an antique bar and allabaster globes sconces, marble fireplace
and the famous stairs to nowhere from the Seven Year Itch! 71 Irving rules the cafe world
They even have their own Victorian farm in Upstate New York, where they roast the best coffee one could find
From every coffee region they roast the most well known blends and varietals in NY
Stop here and look no further as THIS PLACE IS IT!
great food, great place
My friends and I had a really good time I would recommend it to all my friends
If you work anywhere in the general vicinity of Irving Place, you should make this part of your daily stop to or from work
Great atomsphere
Friendly people
And most importantly, great coffee
I love going to bars, but sometimes I just crave a night out with the girls gossiping over an awesome cup of coffee - 71 Irving Place is where I go, no questions asked
The dessert menu will satisfy anyone's after-dinner sweet tooth, too! I especially like how 71 Irving is tucked away from the noise of Union Square - very relaxing ambience and friendly baristas too
I recommend going to 71 Irving after dinner instead of out to a bar!
Daytimes are good, but it's much too crowded at times
At night there is a quiet, cozy ambiance perfect for relaxing, reading, and generally getting work done
The candles add just the right touch
The night staff is usually curteous, friendly and good humored
I'm not sure who the waitress mentioned below was or what the reviewer meant by wad, but I have never encountered any attitude from the staff
Perfect setting for getting away from the noise for a while
Being Greek, through the years I have pretty much checked out most of the Greek food spots through out NY, Brooklyn and Queens
I can honestly say that no one can make a gyro like this place does
I don't know how they season the meat, but it is by far the tastiest you will ever eat
My dad took me to Plaka back in the 80's and I am still going back
My husband and friends love the food as well
I would bet anyone to find a tastier gyro!!!
I've been going to this place since '84 or '85
They have by far the best gyro platter in the city--just make sure to go there when it's not busy so that the gyro is nice and crispy
Get it served with rice and vegetables (yummy), some house red wine, nice big plate of tzatziki, saganaki and you'll be in heaven
Place looks like a small hole in a wall, but is cozy and friendly
The waitresses are very pleasant and accomodating
When they play greek music and a couple of old greek guys sit by the door sipping their wine and eating olives you'll know why I've been going there religiously for years
In Short Upstairs in the esteemed Brooklyn Academy of Music's headquarters is a fancy eatery where enormous windows and vaulted ceilings maintain the institution's high art standards
Yet a mixture of laidback lounge furniture and more conventional dining tables softens any inherent formality, as do weekend performances by up-and-coming performers from a variety of disciplines
The menu, which changes seasonally, shows both regional and international influences
Went to see a movie at BAM and stayed for the dinner special ($21 prix fixe, $18 w/ student ID for glass of wine, soup or salad, choice of three entrees, and a big slice of Junior's Cheesecake)
it's an interesting space, and the food was solid -- better than the reviews here suggested, especially for the value
I'll be back
We visited once on Valentine's day and once at the end of April
First time, they were overwhelmed, the service was dreadful and the hot food was actually cold
We sent it back for a micro-waving! A tough night for any restaurant
In April, the service was fair but again, the food was at best only warm
The chicken appetizer was over-salty while the angel-hair seafood entree was a bland and uninteresting mistake
On both occasions the atmosphere was cozy and sophisticated and would be hard to better
The live music was well chosen and a sensible accompaniment to what had all the makings of a wonderful night out
This place is so very nearly achieving, but in the mean time, my advice - eat early elsewhere, then take your seat, order a bottle of wine and enjoy the performance and the ambience
A great venue with disappointing food
This place is still in search of an identity
Restaurant? Bar? Performance space? It's trying to be all three but it hasn't succeeded in any
yet
Currently, the look is impressive with its glittering arches and multi-story windows; the floor is roomy without feeling cavernous (and features a little gift shop tucked to the side); the programming is eclectic with acts sometimes relating to the stage productions and movies produced elsewhere at BAM
But for some reason, this space has never taken off
The service is too slow, the prices too high, the food so-so
At popular events there's no comfortable space to stand yet I've never seen people turned away
Usually, they don't need to do so
The Scene This downtown outpost of the Little Pie Company is where most of the company's goods are actually baked, so patrons have a good shot at getting hot-from-the-oven, old-fashioned baked goodies
The business is mostly takeout, but there's a small seating area
The Food Pies come in three sizes, from a petite five inches (perfect for the solo diner) up to 10
The staff will even wrap them with red ribbon upon request, for perfect little impromptu presents

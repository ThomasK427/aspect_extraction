The pizzas are remarkable, with thin, flavorful crusts--one topped with sharp broccoli rabe and sweet sausage is superb, though any choice works well
Pastas, like the toothsome homemade pappardelle with mushrooms, and the linguine smothered in calamari, mussels, shrimp, and more, are top-notch too, and served in grandly unfinishable portions
Desserts et alia are marvelous as well
Went to dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed and hot
We were seated at a table right outside the mens room and when asked for a quieter table


we were told to go to the library if we wanted something quiet
All the time there were other tables available in the other room! We asked again and were finally moved to the other room where it was much quieter
I ordered pasta in a pomodoro sauce and it tasted like it came out of a can


took one taste and I was done
They took it off of the bill so that was a good thing
My boyfriend has been there before and has had good meals

so we recommend that you go on an off night and don't order the red sauce! I have no desire to go back there when there are so many other great places on the island to eat!
If my grandmother cooked this well, I would wouldn't have such a fear of the kitchen
But Tuesday night's cooking demonstrations is begining to change that
I shared this event with my daughter-in-law, had great fun in this friendly atmosphere and on many levels it strengthens a most important allience
This would be a great take out restaurant, outstanding food - horrible service
Waiter had problems with English language and order was messed up
I'd stay away next time
If you want REAL italian food on Staten Island, this is the place
Everything is prepared how it is supposed to be, not the usual 'fake italian' cuisine that you usually get on Staten Island
The only thing that could be inproved here are the desserts
Never had a bad meal there
One of my favorite places on the island!
Whenever I am in the mood for good Italian food, I head to Trattoria for my favorite dish, veal saltimbocca a'la romana
Definitely go for some old fashioned Italian food served by SI's friendliest
Be sure to say hello to the owner who always comes around to check how everyone is doing
The food is delicious and served in good sized portions for decent money
Trattoria Romana is my and my boyfriend's favorite Italian restaurant on the island
Even when we eat in the city, we always seem to compare it to Trattoria, which is tops! The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious
The chef is very friendly and is always making sure that his customers are happy
The atmosphere is laid-back and the room you first walk into is cozy while the room to the left can get loud with lots of chatter
At any rate, we always find it romantic and extremely enjoyable!
Went there with my boyfriend for his BD one night during the week
We were the only other table in the place so the waiters were pretty much all over us


Very helpful with the wine selection and the WINE GLASSES


they are buckets, not glasses! The food was a bit pricey, but then again ordered the special appetizer and entrees of the day
Everything was very good
Heard the boca salad is to die for, but did not try it out
Would definitely recommend and will go back!
I have gone to Bocca ever since it opened
I enjoyed sharing a bottle of wine and picking at their Bocca Salad and Fried Calamari outside in the summer, too bad it is gone, but the new construction is great too
Not only is the service and food magnificant, but it is about time S
I
has real italian food
There hosts and hostesses are great too
I think their Bocca Salad is great, but does not do justice for sharing the same name! The prices are well worth it
You spend more traveling to NYC for similar cuisine
The food here is excellent! They have the largest wine cellars on Staten Island! Just a tad overpriced for Staten Island
The food is delicious and the service is great
The prices are very reasonable
My daughter loves this pizza she is constantly ordering from them
This place hasn't been voted the country's best pizza for nothing! Their Pizza alla Vodka is the BEST!
In Short Kid-friendly eat-in restaurants and small takeout shops alike sport interiors done in the signature red and white with a touch of yellow
Orders are placed at the counter--whether customers choose to stay or go--and pies are baked per request
Pizzas-- the hand-tossed to the twisted crust--dominate the menu, but the restaurant also offers chicken wings, salads and cinnamon bread sticks
Best pizza on Hylan Boulevard the pizza crust is easy to digest and very tasty
In Short With friendly servers and goofy gimmicks, Chevys is a big draw for families and groups looking for a fun, affordable night out
A full bar and a dozen different margaritas attract a happy hour crowd, and a tortilla machine is often surrounded by children watching the dough-to-tortilla transformation
Fajitas, a house specialty, are available with nearly a dozen different fillings, from mesquite-grilled chicken to portobello mushrooms and asparagus
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas
I entered this place with a gift certificate and after being seated, the manager told us that the gift certificate cannot be redeemed because of their stone aged technology
They didn't even have a card swiper to check a money amount on a gift certificate
Instead of accomodating us anyway and coming to an agreement, they simply refused to accept a valid gift certificate! Goes to show the way this place does its business! Their location at Times Square isn't much better
They finally honored my certificate there, however it took them 30 minutes to figure out how to swipe the gift card! I will never eat here again and recommend others stay clear of this, over-priced Mexican food place too
There are plenty of smaller, mom and pop Mexican places to eat in NYC that are much cheaper and more accomodating! Avoid at all costs!!!
In Short Hungry customers order at the counter of this comfort-food staple, grabbing their food to go or digging in at padded booths in the dining room, which is painted in warm shades of yellow, green and blue
Best known for its signature sweet garlic rotisserie chicken, the restaurant also whips up rotisserie turkey and Angus meat loaf, plus chicken potpie, Asian or Southwest grilled chicken salads, and sides of mac and cheese, creamed spinach, sweet corn and more
Place is good for people who want a fast, hearty meal
Small Manhattan restaurant ambiance, with a touch of Old Brooklyn flavor (Italian that is)! All rolled into one ultra molto bene Staten Island Italian staple
There are not many good restaurants in Staten Island, but this establishment is a Rare Find! The food is fantastic, and the service is quick and prompt
Out of all the restaurants in Staten Island La Strada is my favorite
Both the food and service are consistant
Amazing food! Amazingly decorated! Nice and quiet
i'd recommend it
It is definitely expensive
However, we made a surprise party here for my dad's 60th bday and everything was top notch
Food was excellent, the cake was great, their back room was perfect for what we needed
We had no complaints about anything they did for us
My family has been enjoying Nunzio's Pizza for over 40 years
It is fantastic!
Back then, Staten Island didn't have many pizza places; now there are many, many new-comers
But, none can match Nunzio's taste
From a young age, I always looked froward to the basil leaf placed in the center of the pie
Perfect
Seating is limited, so you will probably want to order take-out, but a better take-out pizza you will not find!
I was a 26 year Staten Island resident, and the one thing I loved was Nunzio's pizza
I lived on the other side of the island near many other pizzerias, but the one I loved the most was Nunzio's
Great thin crispy crust, with a great olive oil flavor
I think they are one of only a few which drizzles oil on the dough before adding the tomatoes
If you are looking to get back to what real pizza is; thin and crispy, then get take the drive and experience a nirvana

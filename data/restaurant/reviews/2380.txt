The fried flounder is light and crispy and goes really well with the sticky rice! There is a great lounge upstairs to start or end the night
or both!
The food and ambiance of this restaurant are great
It is rather formal, and the food is classic vietnamese
If you're in the mood for a drink, check out the upstairs bar and lounge area
However, beware of the French man upstairs
Ask him for a table, and you are sure to get a load of attitude
Great place
could do without him
I went to there with my husband
Generally, the food was fine, but the table is too small to eat comfortably
I was seated promptly, but it was too crowded there
The Scene It's Valentine's Day every day at this glorious homage to classic French cuisine
The airy and glittering dining room makes everyone feel like a prosperous boulevardier, with its deep red banquettes, gold-leaf sconces and the most lavish flower arrangements this side of the Rose Bowl
The Food Like many old-line French restaurants, La Grenouille has loosened its tie a little and added a number of lighter, less-elaborate dishes to the menu, like a lovely grilled squab salad faintly aromatic of marjoram
That's all well and good, but the main reason to dine is for the timeless classics: foie gras with sweet-sharp fig vinegar, quenelles Lyonnaise (pillowy mousses of fresh pike) with an unrepentant wine-cream sauce and the renowned sauteed frog's legs
A chalky souffle aside, desserts are traditional and satisfying
Not what it used to be
Definitely no longer worth those prices
Room is still great looking
Service could not be snootier
Starting from the entrance to the exit
The manager (owner?) is the worst offender
Too many other choices in NY
This is definitely a special occasion spot, unless you don't mind a hefty bill, but rest assured that either way, it's well worth it
The great reviews certainly are there for a reason (and rightfully so)
The dining room is always packed with fresh flowers; the smell is wonderful
The staff is very attentive and welcoming, and the waiters dance around you like their lives depend on it
As for the food, I suggest being brave and trying something you wouldn't normally eat
Sure, their steak is delicious, but when people around you order the oxtail, kidneys, or calf's liver, you'll be sorry you weren't more experimental (I made this mistake)
Even though I was VERY happy with my steak, after trying the different dishes from others at my table, I wish I had opted for something more unique
This was truly an awesome dining experience
this is my favorite restaurant in new york!!!!!!! the place is so elegent and beautiful
i love the flowers they have there
the food is prepared so nicely! every single dish is magnificent
the staff is great
i love all of them, they are soo nice and personable
you must go!!!!!!!!
While the romantic attraction is as strong as ever, the presentaion of food is heading in the direction of a a neigbhorhood diner
For me the appeal of French food is that is is as pretty to look at as is it delicious to eat
Not the case any longer
The presentation is ordinary, and grossly lacking in creativity
All in all though, the experience is still a special one
I've been going to this restaurant for years and it never fails to amaze me
The food is always excellent, the souffle perfectly done!  I would recommend this place for couples because it is very romantic with the fresh flowers and beautiful colors in interior
The only improvement advise I might have for this place is that please get some internal wiring for the pretty lamps placed on each table
The wires hanging from the lamps and running down to the floor might cause a hazard for customers who are not careful
Aside from that, the restaurant provides well-trained, unobtrusive service
Tasteful and classy
No French attitude
The staff is friendly
Go to this restaurant with your loved one
La Grenouille is an elegant dining experience for French cuisine in Manhattan
Food is delicate and very tasty
Prix fix menu offers traditional French delicacies and innovative combinations
One of the best qualities of this restaurant is it's amazing flower arrangements with a fresh and seasonal look
I noticed that the tables are too close to each other for a quiet and romantic evening
You can't help but the hear the conversations from neighboring tables and if you need to get up from your banquet seat, which is nice to be seated next to your partner, you would require the assistance of a server to pull the table
The other issue is quiet an obvious one which the cost of the meal
I guess being in Manhattan and dining in a French Landmark you would need to get a small loan from your credit card company which is justified
This is break bank expensive but the memory will last a life time
The service is outstanding, not stuffy or snooty
We were greated and were led to one of the best areas of the restaurant
Celebrating a mile stone, this place was perfect
The food is good, I had a steak and while it was good, it wasn't exceptional but it came prepared to my specifications
The dessert is fabulous
We were very welcomed here and would go back again
I was engaged here- it is a perfect place for that
The most romantic place and excellent food
Very pricey though, but worth it for a special occasion
ON A RECENT REVISIT OVER THANKSGIVING 04', WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE BEAUTIFUL FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS MISSING
HOWEVER, WE WERE PLEASED THAT WE STILL FOUND WHAT IS SIMPLY THE BEST FRENCH FOOD ON THE PLANET, IN A JEWELBOX OF A LOCATION, INCREDIBLE AMBIANCE, EXTRAORDINARY WINE, WITH WARM AND IMPECCABLE SERVICE
PRICEY, BUT WELL WORTH THE INDULGENCE
THIS IS OUR FAVORITE, IT IS STILL NYC's FINEST RESTAURANT
PERIOD
GIVE IT A 9
9!!!
My husband and I went to La Grenouille to celebrate our wedding anniversary
The evening that we spent there was unforgettably delicious :-) The service and atmosphere were great
I would highly recommend this place just be aware of prices
I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant with a non-romantic friend
The Ambiance is lovely, despite not having a reservation we were lucky enough to be seated right away
The menu was pale of veg
entrees so our lovely French waiter had the kitchen prepare a special entree
One of the best meals I've had in New York next to Nobu
Our meal with entrees, salad and a glass of wine each was $80
w/out tip not bad given the quality
we recently celebrated my wife's birthday here
we have been to various fancy restaurants in new york city and definitely this is one of the best restaurants we've been
to start of, the entire staff from the maitre d'hotel, captains and waiters were all warmly accommodating
the fresh flowers all over the place gives a noticeable and romantic ambiance
the food is very tasty
it was such a memorable experience and although it was a furious weather because of the blizzard nevertheless, its worth our travel
the place smells incredible, flowers everywhere
the lighting is golden
this is an expensive french restaurant, don't go there if you care about the prices
the food is off the charts, the staff is friendly, just talk to them
La Genouille was fantastic, from start to finish
It is a great place to have a special occassion, or merely, a romantic evening
The management were aware of my plans and were extremely attentive all evening long, especially our waiter, who opened our bottle of champagne moments after I proposed

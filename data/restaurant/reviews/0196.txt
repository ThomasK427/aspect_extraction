my fish was completely and utterly tasteless and my friends beef was disgusting (the meat itself was hidden in this soupy heavy smelly blue cheese and super sweet balsamic like liquid
ick
)
and then the dessert- cheese cake tasted like cardboard and their chocolate cake was like cardboard covered in cardboard
as for the ambiance, its a cafeteria and noone is payed much attention to
i got my glass of wine while i was mid- way thru my entree
the whole experience was lame
We dined last night, a party of seven, sharing the fondue (that's a given), enjoying the perfect cheese puffs served in the cone of wax paper, french fry style
I had the French Onion soup, a much heartier version than I have become acustomed, and excellent
The butternut squash soup also was very good, as well
Others dined on oysters and a sampling of cheese
I had the saddle of rabblt, lightly sauteed, wrapped in thinly sliced ham and a center of stuffing, complimented with a thick noodle served in a spinach cream sauce
Desserts were very good, as well, though nothing too out of the ordinary
We drank an Australian shiraz, that seemed to become more flavorful with all the cheeses
With seven people and two bottles of wine, the bill came to about $82 a person, reasonable for this fare
My bf took me here for our anniversary since I love anything w/cheese
I was surely happy
We had some fondue after our appetizers
That was really good, though mild
I would like to try some of the other blends they have
Our main entree of hanger steak was really good and prepaired well
I wasn't impressed by dessert - I ordered truffles w/bisquits
The bisquits were more like little Entemann's muffins
But overall I liked the layout and would love to go back to try their flights of wine cheese
Had the worst dining experience of my life at this place last weekend
The service was surly, the food inedible and the noise level unbearable
Would never return even if the meal was free
This was the first time my wife and I tried this restaurant, we went with my brother and his wife
We had so much fun
Antonio, the waiter, made the experience so enjoyable
He help us with recommendations on what and how much to have
We started off with a sampling of cheeses with fruit and meats
Then for the main course we had the fondue for four
We had a sampling of breads, apples, beef, and kielbasa (wish it was grilled or smoked) to dip
Our choice was the Artisanal blend, it was very nice, but I think next time we will go with a stronger cheese blend
We also had the mac and cheese, it was nice, but not my favorite
Overall a great place
And if you love the cheese that you have, you can get some to take home at their shop
I've been here many times and have never been disappointed
I love the fondue, especially with the beef tips, pass on the kielbasa and fingerling potatoes
The beef tips are done medium and go great with the cheese
I've never had problems with service or had to wait long for my table or for my food
Be prepared for the potent cheese smell when you walk in and the loudness when they are packed
The tables are also pretty close together so it's not good for a romantic, quiet meal
I have to say all the complaints about this place don't make any sense to me
Now admittedly I went at lunch, when presumably the kitchen and waitstaff are less taxed than at dinner, but everything was fine
The service was perfectly friendly, the food came very promptly, the room temperature was perfectly comfortable, and the food was good
In particular the mac and cheese was outstanding, and the gougeres (sp?) were really great
Definitely get those at the start of the meal
Beyond those, the rest of the meal was good, though not outstanding and not worthy of the lofty prices
(FWIW, that's how I felt about my dinner at Picholine as well)
If you love cheese it's probably worth it, if not, unless cost is no issue at all, I think you could spend your money better elsewhere
They must have read the Citysearch critiques about rude hosts and ruder waiters because the service and attention were marked by friendly smiles from the staff (4) at the desk and a really helpful, patient, attitude-free waiter
We did the summer pris-fixe menu: The cheeses were good, unusual (we bought one to take home); the salmon excellent; the steak frites only adequate; the vichysoise (sp?) smooth rich; and the mango sherbet desert scrumptious and fun
Not noisy at 6pm sitting
While visiting my mother in NY last fall we had brunch at Artisanal
It was wonderful, we enjoyed the ambience, the servers and of course the food
I retured in January and was again most impressed with the service and food, though disappointed that the brunch menu was not offered that day
However, what I did order was excellent
Having read the reviews on this site, I must admit that I was quite nervous for my trip to Artisanal, especially because my family and I were ordering the restaurant week menu
Such anxiety proved to be unjustifiable however
Although their gougeres did not meet expectations, overall, the meal, and particularly the restaurant week menu, were quite well done
Both my salad and steak were delicious, and the cheese sampler for dessert highlighted their speciality well
Additionally, the large amount of wines available by the glass was a nice change of pace, allowing one to pair a different wine with each course
I must admit that, as far as restaurant week goes, Artisanal did quite a good job
P
S
Our service throughout the night was very good and we did not experience any attitude on the part of the staff
great wine, cheese and food
and my waitress was AMAZING
They are lucky they have good food, because the host/hostesses down to the telephone reservationists have major attitudes
maybe they get away with that because someone got them that lazy ass job where they absolutely do nothing but stand there and take up space
while the real waiters do all the work!!
I had brunch at Artisinal Feb
2005
I have never seen such a RUDE maitre de'
I was with a woman friend from NYC
When he began to seat us at a table behind a barrier, she asked if we could sit by a window He said Why? She said so my friend can look out the window
He rudely responded WHY? So she can see the STREET? What's to see? She said, Please just put us at the window
She would like to watch the city's activity
He snottily said It's stupid, but here
, tossed menus down and stormed away
To be treated as if they were doing us a favor to even allow us in was unnacceptable
I come to NYC every year and have had fabulous service, friendly assistance, and great food
I won't go back to Artisinal
There are far better restaurants with much friendlier staff
This place is not worth the great cheese if patrons are treated like garbage
The staff are stereotypes for snotty NYC restuarant employees
The pay must be lousy to be allowed to treat paying customers the way they do
Any question was met with smirks, sighs and snottiness
I like to start with cheese and they acted like I made this horrible faux pas
Never again!
I was excited to check out this restaurant because cheese is one of the things that makes life worth living
I was disappointed though
The cheese was dull, but acceptable
The accompanying food, however, was awful
The salad was dripping with bacon grease with a pool of grease on the plate
What a horrifying thing to do to lettuce! I might give this place another try, but I won't get my hopes up
Maybe I'll just stick to the cheese plate next time
This is my idea of heaven

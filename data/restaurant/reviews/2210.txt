IF YOU LOVE MEAT (FROM STEAK TO CHICKEN AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN), THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU
BRING, YOUR APPETITE AND ELASTIC PANTS
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE KILLER SALAD BAR, WHICH IS A MEAL IN ITSELF
AND THOSE DESSERTS!!! YOU WILL BE PAMPERED AND WAITED ON AS YOU DESERVE TO BE
Wonderful classy upsacle restaurant
I have been there numerous times to satisfy my carniverous appetite
The people are courteous and nice
The bar is beautiful
Classicly Manhattan!!
Excellent meal
Top quality meats
But we were starving by time we were seated! Arriving at 7:45 for 8 P
M
'credit card insured' reservation and not being seated till 8:45 is unacceptable
especially considering they made little appology for the delay
just kept telling us any minute!
Even manager made no sincere appology, instead blaming other customers for taking too long to eat! He did buy first round of drinks
but missed the point that they had managed the reservations so poorly
Loud is an understatement at this massive meat palace
The food is okay, the salad bar immense, but it is a fun place to feed once a year with friends or family
Visit this place everytime we come to NYC
and we never get tired of it!!
I went to this restaurant with my department and found everything to be charming and exquisite
The idea of flipping a coaster of some sort when you were ready to chow down was cute
The waiters and servers were at your reach and the food was delicious
I would recommend making reservations and prepare to be stuffed
I don't know about those who said this place is expensive
Think about how much GOOD food you get for $40!!!! It doesn't look like that anyone leaves this restaurant hungry
The meat cuts were great and I liked how they carve up the pieces for you based on how your rare or well you want the meat
The lamb was very well-seasoned
I know the salad bar is very tempting, but if you're a meat-lover like me, save your appetite for the succulent meats
The steak at La Plataforma is excellent
especially the picanha
The salad bar and meat served by gauchos is truly Brazilian, but the authenticity stops there
There was a loud jazz band playing the night we were there! Forget about nice South American music
Also, the waitstaff was trying to push off a trendy drink that they said was the national drink of Brazil
The times I have been to Brazil, I have not even heard of it
Finally, the restaurant is incredbily packed, even by NYC standards
This is the only place in NYC whose cuts match what you'd find in Brazil in taste, variety, and quality
(Ive visited Brazil)
I recommend you fast all day, have a few bits of hearts of palm and eat meat till you drop
THe live music is a plus and so are the desserts, many typically from Brazil (milk pudding, coconut pudding, mango pudding)
Try caipirinha and guarana, too! ONly drawback: a bit expensive
The food is great - particularly the meat
But the salad bar was ridiculously crowded and disorganized
Worst, however, is the rushed atmosphere
It's almost as if the waiters are incentivized to push you on to the next course
Within milliseconds of clearing our meat plates, the desert lady was at our table
Twice an unfinished drink was whisked away in a haste to clear things off
And that's why I wouldn't recommend this place
This is a meat-lovers Must! This place is great however you walk out feeling like you should be on a skewer if you fill up on the salad bar and keep the coin they give you on green! The salad bar is really good, so thats the problem too
The meats the waiters serve are tasty and fresh
There is a great variety of meats too! We were too full for desserts
The bar is fun with great live music on the weekends
Plan a long nights stay here for dinner
$50 all you can eat!
What a great experience
The beef and pork were the best I ever tasted,and an excellent food value
The staff was courteous and very helpful
Diners of all ages will enjoy it here
And if that's not enough, they have both a hot and cold salad bar that truly has to be seen to be believed
Don't miss this!!
This place is fantastic
PERFECT for pre-theatre, or fun for any occassion, because they can accomodate ANY group size
You start with a salad bar of assorted Brazilian dishes, which are quite tasty
But when you get back to your seat, the real fun begins
The waiters bring skewers of about a dozen different kinds of grilled, marinated meats (chicken, beef, sausage, ham, lamb, etc
), and don't stop offering until you give them the red light
Everything tastes great, and they have a wonderful wine list to accompany the meal
ENJOY!
This brazilian barbeque place is a GREAT place to have fun in a dinking experience, however be prepared to eat, eat eat a lot of meat
Not being a big meat eater, I still love that place
It is a great ambiance and a good place for parties, big groups, espcially loud rowdy kinds! The food is excellent, the salad and sea food bar incredible and the sangria and desserts almost a must! It is a real experience in itself with no menus and for once, let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!
I love this place
If you love to dine on charred animal flesh this is the place to be
There are approximately fifiteen kinds of meat and if you are smart don't fill up on the sides that come first
Wait until the hangar steak, swine and sirloin comes out
I had the waiters bring back so much meat that that asked me if I wanted Flank steak for dessert
I said no
Just bring me the Hanger Steak
There's the large (in size and variety) buffet and the waiters who come around with the racks of meat
Hint: Save yourself for the meat
It better then the buffet
The food was amazing, the salad bar was huge and the service was outstanding
Overall it was a great experience
This is primitive human food served with panache
An almost bacchanalian experience
Everything was Fantastic
From the service to the food, the entire experience was excellent
The food was sensational, as were the waiters
I would Highly reccomend this restaurant to evryone I speak to
Great atmosphere
The meats are cooked to perfection! With this style of eating, it is a lot of fun with a group of meat-lover friends!
Had my birthady party recently there and had a great time
There was sooo much food
It was pretty crowded and make reservations but was fun
I brought a party of 17 people to this wonderful establishment
Besides waiting half an hour for tables to be set, the food was wonderful and very filling
It's every carnivores dream
The food was not only plentiful but of top quality

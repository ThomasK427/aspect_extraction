Decor was cool and the bar kept as after dinner for a few cocktails
LA loved it
We needed this
Great for business and great with friends
Been twice
Once for client dinner and once with 3 friends
Bar was a fun spot to hang out before and after dinner
Neat TV screens
Dinner was teriffic
Tuna cheeks, venison and the halibut all outstanding
BEST priced wine list on the upper east
Only the bread service was a disappointment
Service was good and friendly
I'm going back for a Monday night football game and having dinner at the bar
I enjoyed a marvelous evening out last night at Jovia
The bar offers street level action and the dining rooms upstairs were sophisticated and comfortable
Jovia has the right combination of elegance and energy
I ordered the lobster, the waiter said it was prepared with very little butter, it was delicious and I enjoyed the chocolate dessert guilt free! The Italian/American wine list was well priced and well thought out
After dinner we watched the White Sox win, we walked home happily knowing this place is in the neighborhood
Ate here last week with a group of 4 and we had a great time
The food was great
i had the sea bass which was really good, perfectly cooked with a mango bbq-like sauce
My girlfriends shrimp was a little overcooked but still delish
Get the pom margi
its worth the 10 bucks
We sat in the back room which wasnt as nice as the main room with the cool blue water wall
if i had to choose to go to rosa or dos caminos (very similar menus) i would choose dos caminos
dos caminos food was better, we all agreed on that
Rosa Mexicano is a gorgeous, sprawling place to dine
The blue waterfall is gorgeous
Excellent mexican food paired with fantastic ambience make this a great choice
The guacamole is very good however, ask for it to be made spicy as even the medium was pretty mild
The chilean sea bass was a standout entree
Warm chocolate cake was good but have had better
Our waiter Roy was outstanding
The hostesses should enroll in some etiquette classes
Overall, an excellent place to dine
Third time at the Union Square location and I can definitively say that something is very wrong here
I'm a huge fan of the east and west side locations, they are either intimate or fun, but this place doesn't manage to do anything
It's too loud for a date (yet perfect for a group)
But something about it just screams 'WE HAVE BECOME A HUGE CHAIN RESTAURANT'! Still, Rosa Mexicano makes the best mexican food in town, without any question
I will always suggest going to the east side and enjoying a nice dinner, but this new applebees-style restaurant (i fear what is happening in DC and Atlanta) may fill the stomache, but does nothing for the mind
Went in during restaurant week for what we thought would be a fast lunch, but it took 90 minutes
Food was certainly worth waiting for, but it was loud and I couldn't hear my friends
I was here for restaurant week and got a great 3-course meal for $35
I don't know if I would normally go if the menu was not priced this way
I think I'd save this place for a special occassion because the drinks alone are 10 bucks a pop!  Great atmosphere though and very good service
A friend and I recently went to Rosa for brunch on a Saturday and had a blast
Walked right in and only had to wait about 10 minutes
Ambiance is excellent, very colorful and spacious
Started with the pomegranite margaritas and spicy guac (excellent) and then moved on to the chicken quesadillas
Good brunch menu - it was hard to make a decision between the breakfast tacos, huevos rancheros, and salads on the menu although our waiter was happy to rank menu items upon our request
Finished off with a couple of mexican coffees and the towering Tres Marias dessert
At this point things were a blur, however I know we thoroughly enjoyed our food, drinks, and the service
Would go back in a heartbeat
Last minute on a saturday night a group of 7 of my friends and I decided to check out Rosa Mexicano in Union Square
We called to get reservations and were told that they were booked, but that 40% of the restaurant was reserved for walk ins and were more than welcome to come
When we arrived at the restaurant we were told that the wait for a party of 7 would be 1 to 1
5 hours
Turned out we only had to wait 45 minutes
The food was excellent, the waiter and the rest of the staff were very attentive, and the ambiance was also enjoyable
Great place for a date or for a group
A really good spot to get together with some friends for good food, drink, and conversation
First time to Rosa Mexicana's and despite the cheesy decor, I enjoyed the guacamole chips
plus their martini's
I was with a party of seven and they made us wait until the dinner rush was almost entirely over to accommodate us, making a ton of excuses
For a Tuesday night they should have their act together but didn't
Food was so-so
Our server recommended two double guacomoles and it was almost $60
A little ridiculous for guac
Drinks were just ok, and service was clumsy and unattentive
I don't think any of us are going back
Def
not worth the money
What a great experience!!! We were a group of 8 New Yorkers
We did have to wait a few minutes beyond our reservation but it was well worth it
We all had a fantastic time and an amazing meal!!! The ambience was fun, the service was wonderful and the food was great
We had a number of very picky eaters and there was definitely something for everyone
We are going back again next week and would highly reccommend Rosa Mexicano for groups of friends!!
I love Rosa Mexicana!
it is my fav Mexican restaurant in NYC
So I promptly made a reservation @ the new 18th venue
We were a party of 2 plus we invited along an old friend
1st off the drink orders were wrong
no big deal
then again
A $12 tumbler marguerita was more ice than beverage
2 sips it was gone
Then the food came
The tortilla soup was super salty
I ordered lump crab meat for my entree
it sounded simple delicious but again super salty bland
Just sauce, tortillas the meat
(all the same color) not even a garnish
Soooo disappointing
then to add insult to injury it worked out $80 person (x3) for a casual getogether! I was embarressed as I highly recommended the restaurant the friend
What's going on RM you will not survive w/ those kind of prices poor food service
Made reservations 5 days in advance for a family party of 8 on a Tuesday at 6pm
They called 10 minutes later asking to move the res to 9pm (should have heeded the warning)--they insisted we be out in 2
5 hours

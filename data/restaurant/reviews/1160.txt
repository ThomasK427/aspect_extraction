Who could have ever imagined a braised goat open faced mousaka, a perfectly grilled Branzino with Avgolemono foam and palate teasing Meze of Hellenic sashimi would ever be found on the pages of a Greek menu? My dreams have been realized
I can proudly say that the food of my homeland can now rightfully takes its place in the world of Haute cuisine
My fiance and I, both Greek professionals, were very excited to try the diverse Greek food at Onera, which in Greek translates to dreams
Sadly, we were disappointed for several reasons
First, the food, with the exception of the dried fruit salad, was bland and tasteless
Second, the menu, while diverse did not include a selection of variations on Greek cuisine
Third, when we spoke with the maitre'd about our experience, he responded, Well, we are not a Fish Tavern from Greece
We are trying to bring modern Greece here, what they serve in Athens now
My fiance and I were just in Athens, and we don't recall modern Greece serving the selection at Onera
While we came to Onera with dreams of Greek food, we left with a nightmare
I had seen Lady M featured on a Food Network show and had been looking forward to tasting their famous Millecrepes cake
I was not disappointed
the cake was heavenly and I was quickly served
Although, I took my slice to go, the eating area was not overly busy, though it may be different on other days and times
A definite treat !
Once you eat here, you won't want to tell your friends b/c you'll want to keep the desserts ALL TO YOURSELF! I almost don't want to write about how amazing the desserts are because I would rather have more for myself
Definitely get a slice of the Lady M Mille Crepe cake
Beautiful
The most perfectly elegant desserts in the city - and inventively delicious
Most exquisite pastry assortments displayed on a stunning white marble case
The signature cake, Lady M Mille Crepes is absolutely wonderful
In Short The restaurant seats just 40 diners, with only room for six at the sushi bar
The menu offers sushi and sashimi platters as well as several Japanese hot dishes, including soba soup with duck, miso-marinated black cod, beef tataki with ponzu sauce and green apple, and black edamame
Also on offer is kushiage, or Japanese skewers, which are made of assorted meats and vegetables, coated with panko and lightly fried
This is the most authentic but also creative Japanese restaurant in the city
The atmosphere is down to earth but classy
It's intimate, fun, friendly and sophisticated
The food is excellent, and it's the right price for the quality you get
It's not expensive compared to all the hyped up places that don't even serve good food
It's also not like any of the cheesy japanese/chinese/asian joints around the corner -- it's genuine Japanese cuisine
The sakes are wonderful as well and our waiter was really nice
I had such a great time with friends
Really one of the best dining experiences I've had in the city
Recommended for everyone who really enjoys a good dinner out
I've been to Sushi places all over the world
This ranks in the top few I've been to
I don't know what the other guy is talking about when he says the Sushi chef and owner ignored him, but I'm guessing it was more his attitude than anything
Every time I've gone in there I have been treated like WONDERFULLY
The chef has explained everything I'm eating when it isn't busy
Easily one of the best in the city
Went here with my friends for a birthday celebration
Nice recommendations made by an attentive waiter
The owner even stopped by to make sure everything was fine
Great sushi and a great selection of sake
Excellent experience
A bit difficult to find, but well worth it
The food was excellent [I recommend the subtle sesame tofu] and served promptly
Our adorable waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, though he seemed rather young
Sachiko recommended an exceptional sake
The only real con is the pricing, which is worth it in the end for the overall experience
A particularly good spot for a date
So $ may be a little steep, but nothing more than you would pay for for the same quality food in midtown
The sake selection is amazing
Friendly wait staff and owner give the place a downtown feel
Good first date spot
Finally--A sushi restaurant that serves traditional sushi and doesn't conform to the knee jerk tendency toward Japanese fusion
The waiters were friendly and attentive, as was Sachiko, the owner
Tanaka, the sushi chef at the sushi bar, formerly of MASA, showed me the utmost hospitality and prepared each sushi to perfection
This sushi restaurant rivals any of Tokyo's best
Went to Sachiko's On Clinton with a party of 4
The service was attentive, food delicious and great mood in the back room
Maybe a bit too romatic for the group of girlfriends i went with
it's not so often that you would find a real decent restaurant among the dizzying numbers of newly opened dining places in the LES
The food was authentic and the sushi was excellent! The crowd was interesting mix of LES hipsters and middle age japanese business ppl
i went because there was alot of write up and i was totally unimpressed
it's over priced, atmosphere was too serious, not suitable for the l
e
s
crowd
my date and i left hungry and broke
I expected: small, welcoming, low-key, neighborhood place to for sushi and kushiage
I got: Japanese restaurant where the sushi chefs not only don't welcome you with a traditional irrashaimase!, but where they barely pay attention to you throughout the meal! Sat at the sushi bar received perfunctory service at best
Two Japanese parties, however, were practically waited on hand foot by owner Sachiko, who said exactly seven words to us the entire visit: Would you like to order more sake? Food: fair to middling, not worth any hype
Funniest part: trying to pass off a hanbaga (Japanese hamburger) as Japanese-style beef tartare on a kaiseki sampler! Sorry - you can get a typical hamburger with gravy at any Tokyo corner joint
Keep pulling the wool over the eyes of the bridge tunnel crowd, Sachiko - this o-kyaku will take his business elsewhere
I had a wonderful time with my friends here
THe owners were wonderful and the Sushi excellent
If you are looking for a nice time with out the hype and snobbery this is the place to go
The Scene Airy, clean, sophisticated and perfectly lit, the AvroKo-designed space is clever, but not overly showy
Note the few peek-through windows to the kitchen, soft leather banquettes, the "roll bar" glowing from within
A mix of fashionable expense accounters, young cocktailers and the occasional foodie make up the crowd
Service ranges widely, from overeager to absent
The Food The paired-down menu shows off Chef Patricia Yeo's flare with Asian-New American fusion
Her cocoa- and peanut-glazed spareribs are outstandingly tender, rescued from being too rich by a carrot-orange sauce
The roll bar turns out a decent salmon-cucumber roll; the beef with watercress and hoisin is a better choice
But Yeo's range is best expressed in her entrees, especially the roast cod, paired with a porcini-sherry sauce that's expertly reined-in so as not to overpower the fish
Pistachio creme brulee with orange ice cream hits the dessert spot head-on
we just love everything about this place
the drinks are always great as is the service as is the food
Never a problem or complaint
we live in the neighbourhood and it is our favorite place
Just such an inviting place!!
The shrimp and crab ravioli was delicious
the service was awesome and my cod was a perfect entree
I was too full for dessert, but this is one of the best dinners I have ever had
I had a quick time frame to eat lunch and I work around the corner from SAPA so i decided to try it out
I have been to their happy hours and I was waiting for the day they re-opened for lunch, that was this week
I arrived to be greated and seated outside
I had to wait for my work partner for 10 minutes but while I waited I checked out their new lunch menu, I was suprised to see the variety I could recieve
I ordered an iced teas that has free refills, which I always appreciate

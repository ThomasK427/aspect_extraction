We suggest steering clear of the desert, it wasn't worth the money (go to Big Nicks accross the street for that)
I suggest giving the place a shot
Share portions as you can always order more and the food arrives quickly
This place is just alright
Some of the staff was a bit rude and pushy
It was a quiet Monday night and not very busy and I did not see what was the rush
Some of the dishies were okay
Decor was average
Try it once
This restaurant is dark and candlelit during dinnertime -- a great date place
There is a small, intimate, but chill bar/lounge down in the basement -- again a great place for pre-dinner drinks if you're on a date
The food is of a high quality and the menu is varied -- all around solid Malaysian fare
Lots of spicy dishes
The price isn't too bad -- especially for New York and compared to restaurants in the area
This place has good food--full of spices and quality ingredients
Greasy at times, but overall the food was very yummy
However, it is certianly not worth the price it charges
Penang is a chain, it should not be charging so much for your run of the mill Malay dishes
It's good a good atmosphere, a tad on the darker side, but good for dates
Why would anyone ever go here when the same food (and menu) is double the price of Baba and Jaya in Chinatown
If you're looking for good Malaysian good
Baba and Jaya are definitely the way to go
This place has solid food and a unique, if a bit tacky, setting
I came here on a date, and it was bustling yet we felt we had our own space
The food was great and different from anything else
The food at Penang is always so full of flavor
Their daily specials are always a surefire hit
If you're looking for a good NY value and great tasting food then head over to Penang
My fiance and I have been making the rounds of all the Columbus Avenue eateries since moving to the neighborhood from the downtown hinterlands recently
We were thrilled to see a Malaysian restaurant, but somewhat puzzled by the arrival of my entree, which was a decent cut of beef slathered in what tasted literally identical to A-1 sauce
I would not recommend Penang simply for this reason
What could they be thinking??
Why anyone would want to go to a noisy, overcrowded, expensive place that doesn't serve very good food is beyond me
I was with a group of 15 people that had a reservation and it still took an hour to seat us, even though the entire party was there
Then to top it all off, their idea of group dining was to put three small round tables pushed up against each other
It wouldn't be so bad if the food was good
But unfortunately, that wasn't the case
Just because you add mango or coconut to a dish doesn't make it any more exotic or taste better
My family and I decided to try Il Duomo after seeing a show at Lincoln Center
The food was excellent, the service was wonderful and the prices were very fair
The fried callamari was absolutely delicious and the eggplant parmesian was one of the best dishes I have ever had
I hightly recommend this resturant if you are in the area or not
Its small and charming but you're not smacking elbows with the table next to you
The portions are much heartier than the price suggests
They also have a great selection of house and table wines
I intend on being a regular
I have been to Sambuca 4 times in the past few weeks
I go with my family, I also like to sneak over with a friend, enjoy dinner a bottle of wine
I had a great holiday party in their private room
I was able to set up the menu in advance, the arranging was easy, and everyone was very professional organized
My whole gang loved it, and theyr'e a tough crowd!  The atmosphere is comfortable, not noisy
The service is special, I feel like they truly care, and that is rare in NYC
Everyone is friendly and knowledgable
My friend goes all the time because of their Gluten Free Special Menu
He says it is the best Gluten Free
I am happy to take the time to write about Sambuca, because I am in business, and I can truly appreciate the great job they do
Definetly check it out
We went here with a promotional gift certificate which the owner didn't allow
The waitress was very helpful in our decision making
Everything came out just the way we wanted it
They were able to give us four courses, delivered at the correct time, and always delicious
My favorites were the eggplant rollitini appetizer and the chicken parmigiana
For dessert we had delicious coffee with tiramasu, hot apple crumb cake with four kinds of wonderful gelato
I personally cannot wait to go back for more eggplant but the most fun was round tables
We were a crowd of old friends and the round table allowed us all to hear each other and to comment on each one's life
It was a wonderful night
I would give this restaurant 5* for food, friendly atmosphere and a very filling experience
When we left none of us wanted to waddle down to our cars
I was a patron for fifteen years and finally decided that there are far better places on the Upper West Side
While the food is good, the service has become atrocious
And the management behaves as though it does not care about an unhappy patron
If you want to be ignored and if you want to struggle to get the attention of the busboy (because the waiter or waitress is nowhere to be found) then patronize Sambuca
If you expect reasonable service and a minimal level of attention, then avoid Sambuca
Perhaps there has been a management change or just a diminishing level of interest in the place
It's horrible now
Food, service, atmosphere and friends what more can I ask for? Sambuca provided a fabulous evening for me my friends!! A must for friends getting togethere for a wonderful evening
This used to be a place we enjoyed for years
We have decided that we will no longer be a customer of theirs
The food has really gone down and is not consistent
The worst thing is with the decline of food quality the service also took a huge dive
Waiters clearly do not want to be there which rubs off on to the customer
Why spend money here when you are not made to feel welcome??
My family and I had dinner at Sambuca, and the food was absolutely FANTASTIC! This is coming from a very hard to please group, who dines out often around the city
Aside from the great food, the prices were unbelievably low, the atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff was very down to earth and inviting
And we had the most wonderful table in the window looking out onto W
72 and Central Park West
Will definitely come again and again and again
Great place for a party
I went with a group of 10
It was great food, service and price
Salads are great
Eggplant parm is excellent
I just had a friend's 30th b-day at Sambuca - they made it so easy
Making the reservation was so easy - they faxed me a form and the menu was easy to pick and all set
I have never planned anything easier
The night of the party i gave them decorations and all was perfectly set up
GREAT party planning staff
The was also great and for a good price - and now we also have leftovers for a week (so much food!)
Food and service is excellent! I highly recommend for a group of 2 or more! Don't order too much though - 1 dinner will serve 2 easily
We were a group of 4 on a saturday evening

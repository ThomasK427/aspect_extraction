Do not listen to any negative reviews
I admit the decor may need a little update
but the food and value more than make up for it
There were foour of us for dinner, 2 had the delicious and very flavorful seafood paella, I had the 1 1/4 pound lobster, the last person had vegetarian paella and we shared a pitcher of sangria and one appetizer and the bill with tip came to $100
AND we all loved our food
Can't beat that in NYC!
Nick's City Kitchen is the best kept secret in NYC
Ask Tito, or Lena, or Adolfo, and they will show you just why Latin American hospitality is still number one
I had a excellent experience in intermezzo, the lighting, the energie it's just wonderfull!!! Im going there 3 times a week, and i have been take care of all the time,cute staff and funny, they always make me laugh!! The loud music and dj it's very good idea for this neghborhood,im highly recommended for all the chelsea boys:) The sunday brunch the best, unlimited champagne,mimosa just make my sunday very happy
I liked the atmosphere of the reastaurant: smart lighting and only a few of the tables were too close together
I Started with the perre salad and I wanted to lick the plate
It was delicious! I almost wanted to order another and skip out on the salamon
Fish was ok
nothing amazing
I should have gotten the mahi mahi
The food did not come out on time or together and the waiter never came to explain why
Thats fine
It does happen
The worst is the waitstaff was very loud and horsing around while we eating
They were cracking jokes laughing so loud
It was disturbing and noticeable in such a small restaurant
When I am paying $120 dollars, I would like to have a nice meal
I never saw a manager
I went here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend, his brother and girlfriend
I was hesitant about the choice because I had never tried the food and everyone was from out of town
However, once the appetizers arrived, my fears melted away in my mouth
From the salads to the pastas to the veal, everything was tasty and appropriately seasoned
Everyone left satisfied and couldn't find room for dessert
The music was a bit on the cheesy side
I will definitely return
This is a great spot to hit up before a night of drinks, dancing, or exploring the city
Food quality is average at this restaurant
Fortunately, price is reasonable
Ambience is quite attractive for lounge hangout
The restaurant was so appealing from the street, with it's soft reddish lighting, and the menu looked reasonable, so we tried it and were happy we did
The food was delicious, and the portions very generous
Service was professional and friendly
The antipasto is gigantic - definitely enough for 2
Swear by it
Food won't make you forget mom's but the value and the quality combo makes it a great, quick, meal
Wine is affordable, fried calamari is one of the best and all pasta dishes are above average
Highly recommended!!!
Intermezzo has to be one of the worst Italian meals I have had in a long time
The pastas were seriously underwhelming and I feel I got no value for the money I spent
Both myself and my dinner date left feeling happy that at least we would never have to be subjected to such an experience again
Had a great dinner! A prix-fix 9
95 between 4-6 has to be one of the last great bargains
The food was delicious, the service was wonderful
What a great place near the Joyce and the Atlantic theater, too Would go back often
I stopped in for Sunday Brunch
Nice place, fast service
The waiters were attentive
The food was great
There was a problem with my check--they over billed me--it was corrected quickly and with apologies
I'll be back
This is a great NYC find
We found this place while staying at the Chelsea Savoy Hotel
from the outside it doesn't look like much, but when we sat down we were treated with excellent and attentive service
The wine list is very reasonably priced with an excellent variety of Italian wines
The food is made from scratch, very flavorful, but simple
The ambiance is quiet, but tipical of an Italian restaurant
I have been there 3 times in the past year
The Scene It feels like a stage set for a dramatic brasserie scene; vintage French advertising posters, ochre walls, hand-painted signs and sniffy waitstaff all contribute to the illusion
During warmer months, outdoor tables teem with local color, especially at brunch
The Food The brasserie-style menu excels in solidly built French fare--raw bar, steak frites, onion soup and so forth
Starters, by and large, fare well--the gravlax is mellow and succulent, and mussels marinieres are quite tasty
Entrees, including boeuf bourguignon, steak au poivre and porcini ravioli, arrive heavy on the sauce, and the kitchen is liberal with its sprinklings of salt
I had dinner at La Belle Vie last nite
The food was so good and the service was very professional
I had the roast duck with fruit sauce,my freind had the grilled lamb chops with goat cheese and rosemary sauce
To finish the nite we ordered the grand marnier souffle
I wish there was a Belle Vie in my neighborhood
The food was not good
crabcake was much too salty
the steak au poivre was not appetizing to say the least
even the dessert was bland
the coffee was served cold
much better places to check out
One of the best restaurants in New York City? Dissapointed to say the least, first, the loud and pushy host showed us to a tiny table in the back with cold air bursting out every 10 minutes, (it was in the 30's outside and we were looking forward to warming up, apparently they were having an ac malfunction)
Then we found out they were out of oysters, while their menu boasted a fresh raw bar
The rolls were as hard as rocks, my steak came back tough and included gristle
We sampled a couple of the desserts, they were decent but didn't make up for the medicore menu items and bad service
Again, I found this place through CitySearch and wasn't dissapointed
Me and the wife arrived early enough so that we got seated right away but if you're there past 5:30 you're probably going to have to wait
As for the food? Incredible
She had the crab cakes and I have the escargots
Then she had the porcini raviolis and I had the lamb chop special
Wow, just wow
And desert? You must have the chocolate soufle
Don't even question it
When they ask if you want it at the start of the meal, order it
At one point the wife took my fork and wouldn't let me have anymore
So I highly recommend this resturant
Oh, and I have any complaint it would be that every other table got bread but mine
However, I dealt with it
After searching forever i chose this restaurant to take my boyfriend for his birthday
When we arrived I was instantly amazed by the beauty of the restaurant
It was pretty quiet since we arrived around 5, so we were seated instantly
It was easy to talk because the music was light and not too much
My boyfriend loved how the restaurant was decorated

Luca's is by far one of my favorite restaurants
Every time I go, it's like coming home to friends and family
The staff is amazing and great to know, the food is by far the best I've tasted with everything made fresh
Definitely recommend the lamb ragu
I live in the neighborhood, and have for nine years
We've needed a place like Luca that is inexpensive enough for a weekday meal, but warm, friendly with amazing food
The gnocchi is fantastic, and we've taken friends there who have returned again
It's always packed and the service is friendly and nice
I highly recommend!
Everything you could want in a restaurant
Great food, good service, beautiful surroundings, reasonable prices and a great host
Lots of menu and specials items to choose from so there is something for every taste
Absolutely some of the best Northern Italian food in town
Highly recommend
Great Food, Staff and Atmosphere
I have eaten at Island many times now
I recommend for any meal
This is a very good neighborhood restaurant
The crowd is a mix- young people, families and older people
This place is very expensive, so I thought it would be like Bistro du Nord and Pascalou--expensive but mediocre food
Surprisingly, although we've only eaten brunch here, the food is pretty good
It's very expensive, though, and the portions are kind of small
The service is acceptable, and the ambience is cheerful
My brother and I have come here for years
Whenever my parents come to town, we have Sunday Brunch here
The service is impeccable, Erik the bartender is the BEST bartender in town, and the ambiance is like a little Hamptons getaway
And the Food is so Fabulous
very yummy and I think its actually healthy, but who cares! I recommend the CHOP COBB SALAD
Great Deserts
Also, its reasonably priced
This place is a great nieghborhood joint
It can be crowded, but thats because its popular
I recommend going here to brunch if the overflow from Sarabeths (next door) is overwhelming
besides
pssst
the FOOD/service/attitude IS BETTER!!!   I think this place is one of the BEST kept secrets in NYC
Maybe not after this Review
=) Make a Rez today
There is no better place to get Italian take-out in this neighborhood
The pastas are fresh and hearty, the pizza is scrumptious, and the salads are fresh
Order one of the pasta specials--you won't be disappointed!!!
If you love crispy, thin crust pizza, you have to try theirs
The best I've ever had, especially their eggplant pizza
Simply unbelievable
We rarely have anything but pizza but it is better than all as far as traditional pizza is concerned
Hot with outrageous crispy crust
Everyone behind the counter is unfriendly at best and sometimes rude
In the evening half the tables are set with tablecloths with table service, but I've never tried that
But for a cafeteria style slice - look no further
what a place!!!! The food is awesome!! I loved it and the service is so friendly
great place for a quick bite!!!
Great Pizza, friendly people! I have to admit, the best pizza I have had since they made it like they used to on the boardwalk!
Amazing cheese slice
Great regular food too
The staff is awesome - super friendly and accomodating
Reasonable prices, good servie
In Short Ciao Bella produces tons of Italian gelato every week in its Soho factory, and this small caf offers only a small slice of the vast Ciao Bella empire: about 20 flavors of gelato, sorbet, and yogurt, with seating at a few small tables and booths
Ciao Bella makes more than 100 flavors, and sells to restaurants across the country
A number of New York eateries order custom flavors made especially for them
Normally I'm not a fan of sorbet
Conventional products usually taste like flavored ice
But Ciao Bella
few words can describe the creamy velvety goodness of their sorbet
Not only was their mango sorbet the best tasting sorbet I've ever had, it was also the best tasting mango flavored dessert I've ever had! I highly recommend this place for an after dinner treat!
I love the gelato and my kids love the flavors
Service is friendly and the place is spotless
no wonder Ciao Bella won the 2004 Time Out award for best ice cream
They have really great creative flavors
Last time i had Sticky Bun gelato and Cherry Sake Sorbetti
I pick up thier packed pints in Whole Foods every time i go grocery shopping
mmm
AND Ciao Bella was started in Little Italy
Yay NYC pride!
This place is less than ok
The gelato was barely edible, the service was rude, and the place is shabby with ripped seats
Save your money; Haagen Daz store-bought gelato is much, much better
It may not look like much, but this little cafe sure can conjure up some mean Egg Salad
Probably the tastiest I've ever sampled
I truly savored every bite
Please take it upon yourself to give it a go
I would only reccommend this place if you work near grand central
I left my times square area to dine here during restaurant week, and it was not worth it
Thought the hostess was very friendly, my waiter was pretty bland, didn't speak to me at all except for to ask our order
The food was average, though my appetizer was more enjoyable than my wild striped bass
The creme brulee was average as well
I also went during summer restaurant week and had a totally different experience
My friends and I, a party of 4, had a 6:30 reservation
We were seated proptly, but with only the a la carte menu
When I asked the hostess about the restaurant week menu it was brought to us immediately
The only difference between the on line menu and the one presented to us was one item
We all found something to order on the menu
The service was friendly and not too rushed or too slow
We all devoured our food, and licked the plates with our remaining bread
It was delicious and more than enough food to fill our bellies
Thank you, thank you, thank you
I would recommend this restaurant and visit there again
We went to this restaurant misguided by its very sleek website
First, the pictures on the website -colorful and lively tropical - do not correspond at all with the atmosphere of the place, which is a large unremarkable and empty (on Friday night) pretentious salon without character
Except for the locals familiar with the area, the place is hard to find, because the streets in the area break or are blocked because of Grand Central/Hyatt complex
We went for their NYC Summer week dinner menu, as listed on the site

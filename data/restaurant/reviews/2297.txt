Before I went to Daniel, I had my reservations
But it's all true, from the food to the service, perfect
Daniel himself came over and made a special 5 course dinner for me and my girlfriend
If you are looking for a perfect evening for that special occasion
This is THE PLACE
Marcus, the man in charge
There is a reason why he is highly regarded in this industry
Marcus and his staff, very professional and warm
They serve you together as a team
I have been to many resturants paying thousands of dollars and by far this is the cream of the crop
We're lucky enough to have our wedding anniversary in October, so this year we had the chance to partake of fresh shaved white truffles in abundance at Daniel
The incomparable aroma and luscious flavor made the additional supplement only a fleeting pang in the wallet
My husband and I visit Daniel as often as possible--as often as the budget allows, that is!  Superb dining, awe-inspiring wine list (in bound volumes!), Daniel himself is charming, and service is always at your fingertips
While it is admittedly very expensive, I simply cannot fathom these bitter reviews I'm seeing
Please don't pay any mind to the advice of foodies who can't spell foie gras
Did the tasting menu with wine pairings
From the stone cold butter to the soggy amuses to the miniscule servings, Daniel was truely disappointing
Tastings were so small and parsimonious I was unable to get a repeat of the flavors when they all came together
There were a couple revelatory moments but for the money I paid it should have been an evening of revelations - it wasn't
Service while professional was dogmatic
There are better, more satisfying, high caliber NYC restaurants
This was one of the finest restaurant experiences I have ever had
Service beyond imagination, in elegant, beautifully thought-out surroundings, as well as ethereal food
We had a four-course meal that included a celery root salad with apple gelee and a paper-thin slice of Granny Smith apple
Magnificent
a Duo of Beef in red wine which I found dee-lish but salty
The Roasted Black Bass w/ basil-tomato compote fennel and orange glaze was the highlight for me
Simply awesome
Save up and go for a special occasion, or invent one
You'll never have a more heavenly evening
While the food is certainly not as interesting as Jean Georges, the service will blow you away
The food is still excellent, just not on the same level as Jean Georges and others
You will feel like royalty - the service is simply on another level
We've eaten at some of the best restaurants and found Daniel to be our favorite! I can't believe there are any negative reviews! Food was out of this world; yes it is expensive but worth every penny! service was wonderful, not warm and fuzzy but attentive
great ambiance
can't wait to return!!!
Don't even consider Daniel for a private dinner
I tried to organize my 40th birthday party and was willing to spend $200 per person
The banqueting manager took 10 days to reply to my inquiry and then totally missed informed me
When I finally got a hold of the General Manager (not his voice mail box), his excuse was we are busy
Not worth the money or the hassle
Many better places in New York to get superb food and GREAT ELEGANT SERVICE
Everything you come to expect from fine dining was there: the decor, service, and food
five stars and then some
I went with a group of 4 people who arrived at different times so some us go to know the complimentary Relais and Chateaux brochures casually placed on tables throughout the restaurant (I still use the book today to plan trips, one of which was a trip to France)
We spotted a well known celebrity who went to the kitchen to thank the chef
The waiting room, the dining area, the food, the whole experience could best be described as opulent
Excellent food
Excellent Service
Very expensive but worth every penny
Can't wait to return
Everything about this restaurant is perfect to the smallest details
Staff is extremely knowledgable with elegant manner, something that is often lacking in the city's best restaurants
I consider our waiter connoisseur more than anything
It's definitely an old-fashioned restaurant
It is for people who like and appreciate a perfect, classic dining experience
As a visiting foodie, I poured over all my resources to select an ultimate NYC dining experience
While the room is stunning, the food at Daniel was extremely mediocre
Would not make the top 15 in San Fran
The price for the quality was horific
For a place with a fabled wine list, the wine pairings featured Daniel labeled wines from various vitners
Black Angus was substituted for Kobe, yet a $15 surcharge was still applied
If you're a foodie, STAY AWAY! This place is living on reputation
If you're a New Yorker and know good food, don't try Daniel
For one of the most expensive restaurants in NY, the food was very bland and not enjoyable
Whatever you do, don't order the duck - terrible
Go to Le Caravelle or Cafe des Artistes for a much better meal at a lower price
My girlfriend and I had been waiting for some time to come to New York and dine at Daniel
I had high expectations of this restaurant because of the many superlatives contained in various reviews
I, like many other travelers, pick destinations with the dining as a priority
Let me tell you this, I couldn't have been happier with this meal
From begining to end the staf was very attentive and informative
The only negative I have to ad is that the tables are too close together
Having said that, you will still be so caught up in the culinary delights that you should hardly notice
This was fantastic
Service, food, and opulence like I have never experienced before
Service was amazing
Food even better
Met Daniel himself, and he was extremely gracious
Most expensive dinner I have ever had
Worth it - every penny!!!
My husband and I went here for valentines day 2003
We loved the service and the food was excellent
We each had 2 drinks at the bar, a bottle of wine, the tasting menu and coffee with dessert and spent about $350
We thought the entire experience was wonderful and we will be there again this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had a marvelous time
Took a date there and despite the $370 tab for 2 drinks, dinner, tip, two half bottles of wine, and evian, I thought it was a great value
Best service I've ever experienced in a restaurant
Great somalier
Great waiter who brought out a special birthday desert for my date after asking if it was a special occasion
The food was the best part
this and Bouley are now tied as my favorite all time meals
Try the Duo of Beef!
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
I have had the honor of eating at some of the best restaurants around the world and this is by far the most overrated restaurant I have ever encountered
I had to ask for a wine list
During dinner with empty glasses, we eventually had to get up and pour our own wine
When we did this we were scolded, but no apology was extended
We were seated 30 minutes past our reservation time
They were rude

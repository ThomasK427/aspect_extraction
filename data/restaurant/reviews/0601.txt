Skimpy-sized enchiladas that, frankly, I thought may have as well come from some fast-food Mexican joint
Below average dishes overall with high price tags
With such quality this place belongs in some blue-collar Queens area where the rent is cheaper
For someone who cares more for atmosphere and drinks, it could be a nice after-work hangout like many of the other Park Ave
venues there
And, yes, the guacamole was about the only thing that got my approval
Wouldn't go back here for a meal, maybe drinks though!
Went on a recent Saturday evening
decided to meet a half hour before our reservations to have a drink at the bar
However,the bar was very crowded and a bit loud, although the bartender and drinks were great!!! We were allowed to sit down a bit earlier than our reservation time
Restaraunt was very pretty and had great ambiance
Service was very good as was the food
We tried many different items and they were all good
We were not rushed either which happens a lot on Saturday evenings in busy places
Overall, very very good for a trendy restaraunt
The guacamole was my favorite part the food was okay and I probably would have enjoyed it more if I had not have went the afternoon after I got trashed
I went on a Sunday afternoon and the live Latin Jazz was nice but the same thing
It didnt really help my hang over but there was a very attentive and friendly staff and I will definitely experience it again under different circunstances!
I have been here a few times and each experience has been great! Fast service and great margaritas, try the passion fruit margarita if you like sour drinks it's great
The only unfortunate thing is the bra area is very small and there is no lounge to sit in
My friends and I went there for drinks and wanted to get some gaucamole but couldn't because you had to be eating a meal in order to sit down
I do not recomend as a place to hang out only to eat! The food is very good too
Great guacamole! They make it fresh at your table
I went there with a girlfriend, and we had a great time
The margaritas were excellent
Our food was excellent and the waitress was great
Great for groups of for a date
If you don't have reservations be prepared to wait (1 hour or more)
I've been reading reviews all my life but never felt compelled to write one
After returning home from having dinner at Dos Caminos I felt that I just had to say something; avoid this place like the plague
Me and my date ordered a total of five dishes, and each won was worse than the previous
Simply the worst meal I have eaten since I can remember (I dine out 5 nights per week)
It was a horrible experience
On my way out I saw my waitress outside smoking a cigarette
(I wish I knew where to find her DURING my meal) A fitting end to a very bad dinner
WOW! The food at this place is orgasmic, and its not all drenched in cheese like other places
It was really fun, lots of attractive attractive people (even our server!) And the margaritas, mmm
Im starting to see a trend here with these citysearch review
several of my fav restaurants get such unbelievably mixed reviews
these are places i frequent often and i think something is clear
the people who happen to get not what they expected from their solitary trip to a new resto that isnt on any cheap eats lists get so ornery about their dashed hopes that they run to their computers to rant
Dos Caminos is on its way to becoming a mainstay!!! Ive been three times and the food was always very tasty, clean, 'upscaled' mexican and the drinks are inventive and tasty
Its very good and its very popular too!!! Do any of you really believe that they would be opening a new one in SoHo next month if the one on Park Ave was anywhere near what some of these disgruntled twit say it is?! Try it
The best guacamole! And they make it at your table
If you have no reservation, plan on waiting for the walk-in tables, but the bar is a great area to meet interesting people
I used to visit the same place for happy hours
It was my first visit after the change was made - what a difference! The artistic lighting, seating, and food - all are improved!
If you hate the annoying crowds, have a late sunday brunch
The brunch comes with a complimentary drink and live jazz
Make sure to try the table side guacamole with the warm fresh tortilla chips
Flavorful carnitas tacos
I have to say, I was really looking forward to some great Mexican and a cool ambiance on a Wednes
night, but unfortunately, DC was VERY disappointing in both respects
The bar area is a strip of bar near the front door and very boring - crowd is pretty cheesy, post-college
And the restaurant itself is huge although the tables are packed together and the hosts keep people waiting b/c they have no idea how to tell which tables are open
Aesthetic was very dull too - a few strangely placed mirrors and orange-y lighting and that's it
And besides the good guac and chips, the menu is un-inventive and pretty bland
Our waitress was nice but didn't impress us and was MIA most of the time
I've heard Noche is much better in all categories
I don't think I'll be returning to DC
Food was fresh, not unpleasantly seasoned, but nothing special either
Certainly didn't warrant the price tag, that's for sure
Very cool decor, although on more than one occasion other diners' buttocks were in our faces as they tried to get in and out from behind their tables
It's a huge place, so pull out a few tables and give folks a LITTLE privacy and room
Service was friendly, but not terribly attentive, took 30 minutes after dinner to clear our plates, and another 20 to get our check
Seems as though DC is content to rest on it's reputation as a scene than on anything else
Went there once for drinks and once for dinner
The bar area is really small, so I would not plan on meeting alot of friends there
For dinner, it is good
We were not rushed at all
The guacamole is good, but they don't give you enough of it
The Mexican Bloody Mary stinks! The food was OK, Sea bass was very good, but the Tuna (cooked black and blue) was VERY dry, and had too much sesoning on it, and I LIKE seasoning
I went to Dos Caminos for dinner with a friend on Thursday night
This place is the old Chinoserie renamed under new ownership
The bar was very busy and to my surprise the food wasn't bad
The decor is very interesting and the restaurant is L shaped
The tableside guacamole is good but can't hold a candle to Mexicano Rosa's on 60th and First
Overall a fun place to hang on Park Ave
I would go again in the Spring
by: Aprilann
same thing happened to me (see other post about table resv)
we had reservations and they told us it would be an hour
Then another person in our party told the staff we didnt have reservations and they seated us 5 minutes later! This place is way too crowded and way too expensive
Food was so, so
Not worth the money
NYC will never get Mexican right
The Park Ave crowd is definetly representing!
We tried to get reservations and they told us we were booked
But we walked in anyway and we were seated in 5 mins
The food was great--mini tacos are inventive and tasty
Tableside guacamole also good
And despite the fact that it was crowded, we had to ask for the check--no pressure at all from waitstaff
Will definitely go again
Great for groups
Guacamole is terrific here, they make it right in front of you
The entrees are huge and the desserts are even better
Nicely prepared
Had a great lunch with co-workers there
Highly recommended
The food is very spicy

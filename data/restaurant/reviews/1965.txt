The dessert was very good : chocolate cake with ice cream, and a fruit granite with
GOLD LEAF
It has no taste in your mouth but it makes the meal very decadent ! And as my boyfriend said : the meal is not as expensive as gold, it is gold !  The service was nice and quick (plates were even taken away much too fast)
The waiter explained all the ingredients
I definitely recommand that restaurant, but not for a romantic dinner as you can hear everything the other guests talk about
Next Door Nobu is a sure bet for any late night or if you can't get a reservation at regular Nobu
The food is just as good, and the atmosphere is even more chic if you ask me
I always spot the neighborhood celebs here who prefer to avoid the scene at Nobu and just settle down for the amazing seafood
Plus the raw bar platters are super fresh and delicious - you can't get those at Nobu because Shin, the talented sushi chef, works only at Next Door
I walked into a Japanese Restaurant expecting the best service and food
Unfortunately Nobu next door was overated
The restaurant was too crowded, the waiter didn't seem to have the patience to listen to what we were ordering
food was not authetic and expensive for the portion
I did not enjoy my dinning experience at Nobu next door and for sure I would never want to check out the real NOBU
The two times I've been the food has not impressed me
For being Nobu without the glam, it was just ugh
The food wasn't anything to write home about
I have to go to the real Nobu to know the true greatness of this restarurant
I hope it doesn't fail like Nobu Next Door did
Whenever I'm craving top quality sushi, a fun scene, and friendly service I head to Nobu Next Door
The no reservation policay makes it easy and no matter how long the wait is, it's worth it! The rockshrimp tempura and black cod are must-trys
The sushi is all perfection
the toro is heavenly
Service is always warm and friendly and the vibe inside is great
Any lover of great Japanese food must go at least once!
I had dinner at Nobu Next Door with my boyfriend for his birthday and had a wonderful time
We have been to Nobu many times but wanted to go to Next Door to try the exclusive raw bar there
The raw plate we had included live octopus, shrimp, sashimi, ceviche, and some of the freshest oysters and clams I've had in the city
It really exceeded our expectations
We had several of the retaurant's signature dishes after that, along with a delicious bottle of riesling
Everything was top shelf and full of flavor
The server was knowledgable and really helped to guide us throughout the meal
It's easy to see why the restaurant is so popular and every bit as good as regular Nobu
In fact, I'll go to Next Door next time so I can have some more of those oysters
I went to this place recently with several friends
We tried a number of their dishes family style
The place was packed and the food was delicious
The atmosphere was lively, and the service was excellent
I would highly recommend the place and the food really wasn't that expensive
it's the drinks that run up the tab
Bad service
The first come first serve policy is BS
My boyfriend and I waited over an hour and half and watched parties who came after us get seated first
Their excuse---the tables that were available were for 2 or more people
But there were numerous '2 or more' table around
Come on NOBU
that's not hospitable! NOBU SUCKS! BTW, the food is overrated
There are a million other sushi spots in NY Miami that serve you up friendly smiles, great food and even celeb sightings
NOBU is pure hype
What is the big deal about this overpriced, extremely loud, too tightly spaced tables, bad service and average sushi joint? Okay, so you want to see celebrities, go but you will get jealous over how well they serve them versus the average joe
Get over it NY!
The editorial says it all for their signature dishes-all the nouveau japanese and fushion dishes were fabulous flavor/texture combinations
For the sushi however, head to Tomoe instead
This is as fancy as it gets for those who couldn't get into Nobu, and have to settle for Next Door Nobu
But if this is suppose to be cheaper than Nobu, can you imagine the price for the real thing?? However, the food is still extemely delicious
It's a Neo-Nippon flavor
tinkered with until it's appropriate for the American tongue, however, still novel enough to excite the extreme Japanese food lovers
some of the best fish in the city
i prefer the traditional sushi to their new-style stuff
atmosphere is nice, informal, much more relaxed than nobu
there is often a wait to get in, but they manage this efficiently
i reside in california, and enjoy indulging in east-coast-only sushi - atlantic salmon, special mackerels among them
this was the best! they are open until midnight, so it's the perfect stop after landing and checking into your hotel
the chefs rotate from nobu, so the quality is said to be identical -- just casual and no res needed
my chef had been a sushi chef in la, so he understood :)
With all the hype about this place my boyfriend brought me here for dinner last night
For me it was my first time there and I didnt know what to expect
The wait was an hour but we were both very willing to wait
We ordered the black cod fish, raw oysters, monk fish liver pate and more but these are the few dishes that stand out in my mind
Each of these dishes are very small but very tasty! The big plus to my experiance here was that I was seated next to FRED DURST and CARSON DALY came over to say hi to him! anyhow my experiance was a great one
I would definatly go back here again!
I've lived in Japan for 7 years and love good sushi on both sides of the pacific
What they served at NDN was cold and lumpy and had bad netta (balance between rice and fish)
jean georges new chinese-french fusion restaurant 66 leonard is just around the corner and it's even better than nobu - never thought i would say that about another restaurant, but it's true
and to think both of these world-beaters are in tribeca
My fiance and I came here for my birthday and ordered the omakase (chef's tasting menu)
I like surprises so I wondered what I'd be getting for the $120 order (about 7 [small] portions of food with dessert)
We requested kobe beef and got it
Very good
It was a nice change from all the seafood we had since the beginning of the meal
Service was good, but even better at Nobu
It is too pricey to eat here on a regular basis, but definitely demonstrated good variations on the food from our omakase
If the price paid here is the same as Nobu, I'd rather make a reservation with them
haven't tried the original nobu, but i heard they're basically the same
the food isn't bad at all
a little pricey, but hey, this is tribeca
love the menu; quite eclectic
haven't seen bobby d
yet
After rustling up a party of 6 to comply with the irritating reservation requirement, we were seated right away on a Sat
night
Service was great and very friendly, black cod in miso and sashimi were excellent - truly mouth watering, and the presentation was amazing
But all agreed that the sushi was VERY disappointing
Definately not great
I'd stick with Bond St
or Blue Ribbon for great sushi
Overall experience was a good one, but definately bring a fat wallet if you go
Only disappointment to NDN when compared with Nobu is that the decor is not nearly as appealing - and for the $$ you pay, I expect to be wowed
The first time I ate here was sometime last spring at around 6 PM
I got a seat at the sushi bar right away, as I was the only person sitting there

loved the crispy rice among other dishes
totally recommend!
This place is pretty uppity
No problem
The food overall was very good
I had the Dorado fish but it wasn't the filet
I had to pull back the bone and stuff myself
For those that eat Dorado, you'll know the bones it in are very small so I spent half my time making sure I didn't swallow any which took away from the tasteyness of it
Make sure you make reservations and DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get anything the waiters recommend
All of their recommendations are the most expesive items on the menu
i
e
2 pieces of sushi for 55 bucks
They also add the tips to the bills
but yet expect a ton more
This place is a great first date joint for all you high maintanence girls that still believe Carrie and Miranda are the typical NYer

my wife i were first introduced to Koi in LA by good friends of ours where the 4 of us had a fantastic time eating great food, drinking tasty wine and being merry
upon returning to newyork the 2 of us decided to visit NY's Koi to see if the food was on par to its big brother on the westcoast
well we were NOT disappointed! -- the creamy rock shrimp tempura was brilliant, the roasted duck was absolutely amazing (i don't normally eat duck, but this is sooooo good!), the sushi/sashimi was so fresh, and the service was perfect -- friendly, not on our backs every 2 seconds but prompt enuf for us not to have to track them down
get over there
its a fun time w/ good food
I came to Koi unsure of what to expect, given the drastically different reviews I had seen on this site, and was blown away
The food was amazing, and while some portions may have been small, the quality was there
If you want bang for your buck hit McDonalds
if you want quality sushi go to Koi
There was a large party seated near me, and I kept seeing more and more food go out to them, which my date and I were drooling over
Can't wait to go back with a big group and try out more of the menu!
The place is really nice
the food is great
Portions are on the small side for the price though, but overall the food is excellent
They played great music too
The special drinks were amazing; i tried the raspberry mojito and loved it! Overall it was a good time
We made reservations for Val's day a month in advance
The place is beautiful, but it was filled with mid-class people who couldn't afford to be there
We were seated right away and out coats were taken by the hostess who dissapeared with the ticket
After sending 3 people in her search, the ticket was finally recovered
Then another pleasant surprise - the menu said we had to share the entree for each couple
Originally the menu that was e-mailed to me said that we share dessert and one of the apps
We decided to share order of filet mignon for the table because there was just not enough food
The portions were tiny, the service was bad and the wait for the dishes was too long
Overall, it was a very dissapointing experience considering the bill came to be more than $750, althou pre-set menu was $85 per person
I was looking forward to eating at Koi all week
My friends and I (total of Four) each ordered a different appetizer, and entree and all were terrible
The apps were boring or overly salted, the tuna tartar was the most bland I have ever had
The entrees were so salty (specifically the salmon and seabass) that we each took a bite and left the rest
THe room was beautiful, as were the people
But the music was soo loud that the waiter couldn't understand my friend's request for a switch in her entree and ended up with two dishes (trust me, neither were good)
I feel badly writing a poor review, but I expected more
My boyfriend and I went to dinner here on a Friday night and we had an awesom time
The whole ambience was great; the music, lighting, interior decorating, of course the food was great
I highly recommend the salmon sushi and the brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert
Afterwards we went to the Cellar Bar - great music - very Armani
A very romantic night
The Staff here Frightening! The food sickening
Horrible experience, wish I HADN'T WASTED $350
Food was really good
Highly recommend going
5 of us went on 11/19 all girls had a good time
Passion Fruit Martini incredible!!! I would recommend having a cocktail after dinner at the Cellar Bar downstairs from Koi
Read comments on Cellar Bar, the bouncer is trip!!!
I went to Koi for the first time in L
A
and the food was excellent and I got to do some star scoping, but the whole place was a bit much
there was a bouncer checking for reservations at a gate out front for heaven's sake!! I thought it was a bit too showy and over the top
The NYC location however elimitated that over the top pretentiousness and the food is just as good
I would definitely say I prefer the Bryant Park Hotel Koi, hands down!!
Our group of 6 went expecting the excellentce at Koi in LA but were severely disappointed with the 1
5 hour wait to be seated, rude and disrespectful staff, somber and depressing setting, mediocre food and exorbitant price
The manager even forced us to pay the 18% gratuity
Given the many excellent restaurants in Manhattan, I would not risk ruining an evening with Koi
My Boyfriend and I went to Koi for our anniversary
I made a reservation 3 weeks in an advance and the only time i could get was for 7 pm- We arrived and were seated right away not in the main dining area but in alittle area right in the front-very boring
The service was attentive even though the waiter seemed a bit stuffy and not very welcoming
I was expecting much more for the price- we could have eaten at any asian/sushi restaurant in the city- overall its not worth it
I would not go back
After hearing how great the Koi in LA was were dissapointed
This Koi is 'okay' it's definitely in a wrong location
The restaruant is too big
that the place always looks empty
If you are a big fan of Koi in LA like I am, DO NOT expect for the food to taste the same in this NY chain
it's definitely off in many of the ingredients, that all you can really do is pout
Also, the waitresses are extremely unprofessional
I think they hire temps
4 girls out for fun--great decor, delicious food raving about the rock shrimp
hard to work a buzz with the server taking so long between every round, but worth trying the signature african rum cocktail and happily surprised they had our favorite white - sancerre by the glass at this japanese restaurant
loud but energetic vibe
no fashion disasters in this place
loved heading to the downstairs bar afterwards
Two colleagues and I went to Koi on a Thursday night and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table
There were a lot of scensters who couldnt afford dinner hanging in the waiting area so we got bumped around a lot
Once seated our waiter (Adam) was very kind and we had him order us a bunch of items upon his recomendation
As each item came out, it tasted like the one we had just finished
What was that weird mushy pink gooey ground up sushi stuff they seemed to pile on everything?  One thing that really annoyed me was that they only had Low Sodium soy sauce on the table which to me tastes like brown dishwater with some salt in it
I asked for the regular kind and they said they don't even have it in the restaurant
HUH?
My husband and I celebrated my birthday at Koi and it was an enjoyable experience
The waiter was helpful, the sushi average, but the entres were mouthwatering
Aside from the laughably small portion, the tuna tar tar was superb; frest, and bursting with flavor
Trendy atmosphere adds appeal

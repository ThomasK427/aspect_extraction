Spicy, but not to offensive degree, I heard about this place from some friends who live nearby
No reservations for small numbers, so we waited outside as the bar was full
Some of the food descriptions (e
g
Godzilla) might be cryptic, but the staff's more than happy to describe the dishes
in mouth watering detail
Well balanced ratio of seafood to meats, from non spicy to blackened, makes it easy to find something for everyone
Ambiance is very homey, slightly loud, but familiar
which perfectly matches the comfort-cajun meal
Thoroughly enjoyable food
even after a 20-25 min wait
Arrived just before 10 p
m
on a Sunday night my first time - and rather than encountering surly servers eager to go home, we were welcomed and treated with great care
Shrimp alligator cheesecake and shrimp etouffee were both delicious (I disagree with the Citysearch reviewer's negative take on the shrimp etouffee - I found it addictive)
Returned to take a friend out for a birthday meal
service was again excellent, owner came by to greet all guests
very friendly, relaxed vibe
Don't be a wuss and get the fried chicken salad - it's not a salad, ladies, it's a vessel for blue cheese and buttermilk, though delicious! Smothered chicken was delish
Wonderful place, fantastic addition to the west side, can't wait to go back
Great New Upper West Side Restaurant
Since I've eaten in the New Orleans original, I had to check out it's Northern duplicate
The corn muffins are excellent, Jiffy I think?, and the fish from the gulf withstand the trip and are served up in New Orleans style
Very noisy, but so is New Orleans!
I know the place has just opened, but tweaks are definately in order
Service, menu, food descriptions and drinks, just to name a few
I may or may not go back
However, apps and deserts are off to a good start!
AWESOME, RIDICULOUS - just a few words used by myself and friends while tasting the food
A great place - doesn't quite have the same feel as the original in New Orleans, but it's well on its way
The tastes are like nothing else you've ever tasted in NY -- and the scene is great for groups or on a date
Great atmosphere and great food! There was a little bit of a wait because they do not take reservation for parties under six, but the wait was WELL worth it
Even though the restaurant had just opened a few days earlier, the food and service was fantastic
From the start, the fresh, hot corn-bread was delicious
The blackend tuna w/ brie/champagine sauce was outstanding and will keep me coming back for more
The Scene It's owned by long-time Peter Luger head waiter Wolfgang Zwiener and it shows, in everything but the elaborate Guastavino-tiled ceilings and white linens
There's a profusion of jeans and shirtsleeves, and an unmistakeable and enticing aroma of charred beef
Service is experienced but often rushed
The Food The prime steaks, which are dry aged in the basement for 28 days, are the overwhelming draw
The restaurant serves sliced porterhouse for two, three or four on sizzling platters a la Luger, but it's the filet mignon that's the best bet, since the steak arrives whole on a warm--not hot--plate and therefore doesn't overcook at the table
Don't miss a platter of cottage fries--thick, large and warm freshly fried potato slices--and be sure to order the creamed spinach as a side, but skip the generic, bland Caesar salad
Desserts, such as cheesecake and Key lime pie, are standard
Service is definately rushed
Reservations are always a must and expect to wait because the place is always packed!
70% meat 30% fat
By far this place is no comparision to some of NYC high end steak places
We had reservation at 7pm and were seated at 7:20pm
Very Crowded and tight tables around you
Waiters are super efficient and super RUSH for you to finish your meal so they can seat others
Great seafood appertizers and typical supermarket style dessert
Pay a bit more and stick with the original go to SPARKS! OR you can save $$ and go to Outback on the Eastside for better values
WATCH YOUR WALLETS and YOUR BELONGINGS
When I go to a highly recommended, over-priced steakhouse I expect a steak that is so tender you could cut it with a dull butter knife
For that reason, I was surprised when going to Wolfgangs over the weekend to find that the steak actual required a lot of cutting and chewing action to get through
The service was excellent, however
The side dishes were also pricey but delicious
I wouldn't go back there again
After waiting almost an hour for a table (with resies) our waiter told us that they don't have a sommelier because no steakhouse has a sommelier (patently false), and finished with the notion that he had absolutely no idea about any of the wines on the list
The night went on from there with amazingly rude and crass service from start to finish
you would think that the head waiter from Peter Luger's might know something about service
apparently not
don't waste your time or money on this place
the food was okay
steaks were pretty good but both of our steaks were overcooked by one full grade
You can definitely do better elsewhere
Also, I think about 75% of the tables had them sing Happy Birthday to them
some obviously in jest
I thought I was at Chuck E
Cheese
My boyfriend and I took a family member here for his birthday dinner last Sunday and had a phenomenal food experience! We got the steak for three and were more than stuffed
The quality of beef was amazing and it just melted in your mouth
We had creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for our sides and they were also excellent
Just be sure your wallet is prepared for the punch
For three people the bill was over $300 (we ordered a couple bottles of their lower priced wines too)
I wouldn't say the service was worth the price, but for New York City the service was not bad at all
Three couples went here for dinner on a Saturday night
The food was very good
BUT, the second the check was signed, the host approached the table and asked for the table back! We had just spent $200 per couple and were pushed out of our table after one hour and fifteen minutes
If you choose to go here, don't expect to linger one second once your dinner is over
We called on a Wed for a Sat night reservation for two and only 5pm was available -- not desirable but fine on short notice
Turned out to be perfect since it was the first seating and there was no wait (which I expected after reading other postings)
Porterhouse for two was melt-in-your-mouth amazing
Sides are steakhouse classics - mashed potatoes were creamy and asparagus was tender but not mushy
I'm not a steak fanatic but I can't wait to go back
Comparisons to Luger's are inevitable, given Wolfgang's background, but this place stands on its own
Service was terrific - despite restaurant filling up quickly, we were not rushed at all
Waiter was attentive and responsive
Expensive, yes, but worth it
Despite the small size of the dining room, this place dishes out huge steaks that are consistently the best I've had since Lugers
Yes, you may have to wait at a lively bar where there are always plenty of characters - but the wait has never been more than 15 minutes for me and it is always worth it
The staff have always been top notch, despite the frenzy in the dining room
The Ribeye is good, but the porterhouse is the best bet - and take the bones home to knaw on over the weekend
Had a reservation for two at 5:30, was greeted graciously and seated immediately
The ribeyes we had were cooked to perfection, and unbelievably delicious
The German potatoes had perfectly caramelized onion pieces and were the best I've had
The creamed spinach was wonderful
The service was impeccable as well
Definitely going back
I made a reservation several days ago for an 8pm seating
My party of four arrived on time

There were tons of people having dinner, a birthday party at the private bar, and large groups sitting at over-sized booths
The bar is perfect for having a bite to eat, people watch or view the games
You will not be disappointed in any way at Uptown, they have all the bases covered!
I recently saw The Uptown on Fox's Good Day NY television show
Uptown was said to be best date spot, amazing food, great presentation, cheap eats
I must saw, I have to agree
I usually don't judge a place by reviews, however this place is great
The atmosphere only complements the amazing menu
Plenty of cool martinis to choose from and a great wine list by the glass (I think they have 30 wines from all regions)
Service was key: friendly and helpful, no attitude
I would say, upscale, but not stuffy and very reasonable on prices
Great open space with a fun alive vibe
The only negative, I wish they would open one up closer to where I live
How about a Soho version?
Went there with some of buddies to watch football this weekend and it was great
Not as packed with the young punks as some of the other places in the neighborhood and the food was awesome
Great place to go if you want to go watch a game in a little more of an upscale scene (with a lot more room) w/o breaking the bank
It got good at night too
a lot of cute chicks rolled in
so we hung for a while!
This place has it all
After years of living on the UES, with limited choices, my friends and I finally found an oasis
Uptown Restaurant Lounge truly has it all
The menu, wine selection, martini choices, and the overall vibe of this place is beyond words
Cool atmosphere, very friendly staff and a great looking crowd
Outside seating, full dining room, huge bar area and great music make this the UES best kept secert
However, the place is packed, so I guess the secert is out
Don't change a thing!!! TK
I just wanted to let as many people know how great this new place is
My 2 sisters and I threw our husbands a joint surprise party at Uptown this past Saturday night
We had 200 guests attend
I could not believe how well we were treated
The staff and management went out of their way
The food, music, ambience, and drinks were AMAZING
We had our party at Uptown's Skylight Bar
I must say
Hands Down, a great event
We will be back and appreciate making this party so impressive to all our guests
Great job!  Sincerely- Caitlin, Riley Molly
We had a girl's nite out and it was great
I am definately going back
The menu was amazing
There was something for everyone, the prices were reasonable and the food was delicious
The atmosphere was perfect for any age group
The decor is warm and inviting and the music was hoppin'
So girls' when is the next Girl's Nite Out?
Great spot
Sexy looking, Great food, good music, and a phenomenal wine list
Good looking staff and plenty of room to move around in
Skylights were a big surprise
Had my doubts as it is still the UES - but Uptown Lounge is what the neighborhood desperately needed: A downtown lounge with an uptown address!  ThirstyTraveler '04
It's about time the Upper East Side has a place you can stay at all night
not just a stop before or after you go downtown
I thought the ambience and music were great and the place even has good, reasonably priced food - we've been twice - once for just appetizers and the other for a sit down dinner
All in all I highly recommended this place
Great atmosphere, food was wonderful
The decor really makes the place
Perfect for just going for drinks with friends or having dinner
Love the plasma tv's and DJ is great
The service staff were very attentive
I will definitely be going back
My friends and I have been searching for a hip bar uptown with the feel of a dowtown bar--finally we found it! Uptown Lounge is the perfect place to go for people in their 20's, 30's and 40's who live or work on the upper east side
This is a place that you can go to if you want to relax with old friends or if you want to meet new ones
I can't wait to go back in the summer and have a drink outside
A restaurant with fabulous food, brings downtown ambience to the Upper East Side
The front bar scene is jumping for the single guys and dolls looking to get there groove on
The back lounge is perfectly situated under two clear glass skylights
it is the perfect decor for first dates or romantic dinners
The amber glow of the chandeliers and wall sconces sets the mood for a laidback and chill evening or getting groovy to DJ's tunes
In Short With gleaming copper countertops and a lounge area in back, Chickpea stands out from the St
Marks milieu
The small spot offers falafel and shawarma, as well as the hybrid "shawafel," but also features fresh-baked pita bread, compose-your-own salads drawn from an array of ingredients, a soup of the day, house-made baklava and other desserts
Growing up on falafels and middle eastern food, this place is great for people who have no clue how this food is to taste or are just really drunk
For the rest of us knowledgeable people, save your money and buy yourself a plane ticket to the Middle East or Montreal where you can get the real stuff! Service is really bad-they could use some help in management
hmmm
job anyone?
I love Chickpea! As a self-described falafel connoisseur, I have to say I think Chickpea is by far the best falafel in the city
Great food, cozy little Moroccan-style nook in the back
I am totally hooked
Definitely try the shawafel-a very tasty combination of falafel and shwarma
All these negative reviews are completely insane
This is the best falafel you will find outside of Israel, and definitely the best in New York
They also make their own tahini and saurkraut, both of which are amazing
If you don't like this place, you clearly have no idea what falafel should taste like and should probably stick to fat-filled, sugar-laden fast-food
But this is just one reviewer's opinion
Utterly forgettable - they could give this crap away for free and I wouldnt wish it upon the homeless
All I wanted was some good falafel
Instead, I got outrageously bad service and inedible food
After waiting for ten minutes totally forgivable in and of itself the staff first skipped me over, then accused me of cutting the line, interrogated other people as to my whereabouts over the past half hour, attempted to redefine what line means, and finally argued about giving me my food *after* I had paid for it
The upshot? The food turned out to be worth neither the money nor the argument it was total garbage and had to be disposed of immediately
i really looked fwd to having a decent falafel
but i was very disappointed
it was like tasteless mush
nothing would have helped
not even hot sauce
and the staff was not the most helpful
i dont recommend
unless you like tasteless mush
Having eaten at the local falafel place hundreds of times, I looked forward to sampling this one
Although the ordering process was not intuitive and the staff was less than helpful in explaining it, I spotted the cool lounge in the back and made a beeline for it

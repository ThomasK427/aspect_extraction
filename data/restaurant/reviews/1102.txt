when i asked him a question about the cuts of beef, he told me to read the menu
and we started the dining experience by introducing ourselves to him
don't bother going, it was terrible all around
a wonderful dining experience
beautiful restaurant, very good food and attentive service
now to the view, SPECTACULAR
highly recommended for everyone
be sure to take a stroll on the broadwalk after dinner and oh yeah, bring the camera
jay
the view is spetacular and the service excellent
however their menu needs to be a bit more eclectic, the food was just too too average for their prices
on the down side the loud wedding singer has got to go, if they want to attract more and more customers
I took my visiting parents here for the skyline view, only to have the worst restaurant experience I have EVER had
The restaurant had a mediocre jazz band outside playing so loudly that, sitting inside, I could not hear the person next to me
Our reservation was at 7:45, and the food did not arrive until 9:45
We got our bread basket at 9:30
What's worse, the manager's reply to my questioning on these matters was an indignant, It's live music, what do you expect? and the cook's wife was in an accident with a mean glare
I was very sorry to hear about the accident, but shouldn't he have at least expressed his appologies for our wait? Furthermore, when I go to a restaurant, I generally expect to hear the person next to me, not a painful musical performance
The view is stunning, but not worth the hastle
the view is the signature of this lovely resturant
the decor is just out of tis world
i discoverd this palce by chance while i was driving from work i stop to see a friend of mine in long island city,she invited me to riverview ,i was stuned that there is well dressd up resturant in this up coming neigbrehood, the food is modern italian cuisine,very tasty and big portion,i had to take some home,the waiter was very knowlgebale about wine,we had a botle of frensh red wine ,its was a good choice
Lovely dcor and view but horribly slow services, which there was no excuse for since the restaurant was, empty (our group of 14 and about 6 other patrons)
Yet, it still took over an hour for us to get our food, which was alright; my nephew said his tortellini tasted like Costco, they even forgot to bring my beverage
The waiter was rude acted like we were bothering him
I would identify him but he never bothered to introduce himself, which was reflected in his tip, thank god gratuity was not included
The entire experience lasted over 3 hrs
If you want to enjoy the view go the park across the street
Yes, the view and decor are gorgeous but, We were a group of 14 on a Saturday, there were approximately 8 other people in the restaurant, we entered at 12:30 and took an hour + to get our food, was alright
We were a 1/2hr late and was told the chef just arrived therefore, no soup
The rude waiter never nformed us his name he appeared like we were bothering him
We brought a cake for a birthday celebration it took another 1/2 hour for them to bring the cut cake out and we had to request the check and still it took another 15 min
I can only imagine what the place is like if there were more people in there
Overall, not worth it, you are better off admiring the view from the park across the street
We finally got out of the place around 3:30
I took a girl who is really important to me on a date here about two weeks ago
We had a wonderful night the food was excellent, the view was great and the bathrooms were really cool
However my only complaint and the only thing that is holding me back from going back was the service
It may not seem like much but we needed our waiter for several things and it just took way to long
the service was very slow and his knowledge of the menu wasnt that good
Other than night if you need a place with a great view, ultra modern this is the spot!
My boyfriend and I decided to go to Riverview on Valentine's Day 2006, not such a good idea
People were leaving because they had been waiting for hours, however we decided to stay and have a complimentary drink at the bar which was absoloutely beautiful along with the view, the only plus
We were seated after about only 20 minutes however it was already 10pm
The menus took about 15 minutes to come, the menu were already set up for Valentines day the salad was good my dinner was a soup of about 2 or three shrimps, THAT'S IT! Dessert tasted as if it had been sitting there for hours
The bill was $85 a plate, not even worth have of that
If you're looking for a nice view and nice decor this is the place, do not go on a holiday, there was one waitress for the whole restaurant
My husband and I went there for Valentine's Day last night
In short, it was one of the most horrible dining experiences I have ever had!!!! We waited for over 1 hr and 15 min for our entree to arrive after the appetizer (which came cold and undercooked)
The couple next to us just walked out of the restaurant, they were so disgusted with the service and atention
The Manager did not do much to make things better
At $85 per person, this was a complete rip-off and I will NEVER go there again
but that's about it
Food is average, nothing to rave about
Service was pretty good
The view however is spectacular, and the live music is also a nice touch
Decor is very trendy, but aside from those things, food is waaaaaaaaaaaaay expensive considering it's just OK
Went here for a 1 yr anniv
The service was excellent, very humble folks, was welcomed twice before we were even seated
Food was decent, nothing to get excited over, for the cost
Wasnt bad though either, the service made up for that, the view of manhattan was nice, booked on opentable
com and reqested a window seat which we got
not very busy for a friday night, music was good
over all, you should go
seemed like they were trying to make it a point of good service
I went there on Wednesday with a girl I met who lives in LIC
I live in Manhattan and never venture into Queens
She suggested we go to Riverview so I agreed- even though it was against my better judgement but I'm glad I went! It's a really cool lounge
The only thing I'll do differently next time is go with my friends because my eyes were fixed on the gorgeous women that were there and I think my date picked up on that! The view of Manhattan is SWEET!
I went there with my husband for my birthday
Location is really nice - reminds me kind of Battery Park City
The food was just mediocre at best
My husbands potatoes were way too salty and just unbearable to eat
My fish was soaked in butter
We order a battle of wine and after maybe 20 minutes AFTER the food arrived and we complained twice we got it  Location is great I wanted to have my anniversary dinner there with our family (they have a nice party room) but I dont think I can eat their food again
And they have to improve on their service! Also, the restaurant was empty on Saturday night (it was sunny then but rained right when we were about to leave)
Unless you have food allergies, I highly recommend ordering the tasting menu
We decided to go with 7 courses but I think 5 would have been more than enough
Everything was absolutely delicious
The wine list was a bit pricey though and location was very hard to find
The decor was very nice but the very open space results in great acoustics
Great when the band is playing, not so great when there's a large party at the bar
It was the perfect night, I mean truly fabulous
I really needed a night away from all the chaos, a night with just my boyfriend away from everything
He took me to RiIVERVIEW, five minutes outside the city, but close enough to dine looking over the most romantic view of the city skyline
The food just kept coming, it was so incredibly delicious that both me and my boyfriend were considering ordering a third entree just to share!! The ambience, the food, the desert, the view
TRUST ME THIS IS AN EVENING AWAY FROM THE CHAOS, A DELICIOUS, PERFECT, ROMANTIC, DIFFERENT KIND OF DINING THAT IS TRULY AN EXPERIENCE
A VERY SPECIAL ONE
!!!
For those of you afraid to leave Manhattan, Riverview is seriously about 5 minutes through the tunnel and every bit worth the trip
The food is better than most found in manhattan and the view blows it away! Desserts fabu as well!!
Daniel, Jean Georges, Ducasse, if one day you decide to move out of manhattan, ask these guys
From the welcome to the out of this world food, from the service to the crazy desserts it was all perfect
Why don't we have such a place in manhattan
At these prices it's a bargain
I'll be your PR forever
I went to riverview with my wife, and I have to say that's the most romantic place I've ever been to
The view of Manhattan is incredible, but more than that, the experience was one of my best restaurant experience
First the staff is very professional, and the food is just phenomenal
Especially the scallops and the lobster

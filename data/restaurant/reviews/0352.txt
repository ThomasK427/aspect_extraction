The wine list was extensive and even had a little chart to help you choose which wine you might possibly be interested in
waiters provide friendly service at an unrushed pace
the manager came over and offered our table free dessert wine after i took his recommendation
i saw several managers stop by every table and greet everyone
the food was flavorful and a bit overpriced, but if you cant afford it, you shouldnt be considering a high scale restaurant
Wonderful meal, start to finish with extremely attentive service
Was seated immediately for our reservation and meal proceede fairly smoothly
Only delay was in receivng cocktails and the bar was not that busy
The house specialy pasta with the prosciutto and truffle butter is superb
Pricey for pasta though
Very fresh pasta as good as any I have had in Italy
Veal chop is too small
the menu is a little heavy on beans which is not great if you do not like beans
Also enjoyed the sorbet sampler
A beautiful, sleek, contemporary space with a sophisticated air
Tuna carpaccio was among the best I've had, pasta dishes were tasty and not as expensive as I had expected
Service was professional and attentive
Not too noisy, which makes Fiamma a great spot for a romantic dinner or for a business meeting, too
Attentive service, tasty food made for a wonderful night out
Food was delish with a nice selection mainly focused on seafood
Desserts were creative (not to mention yummy)
Wine selection was decent, both Italian and American
Staff were helpful and friendly
Would definitely recommend to family and friends
The service was just as good before they knew I was a friend of someone who worked there
The servers are friendly and informative and take care of your needs and the managers are attentive and make sure your dining experience is the best it could be
I hightly recommend Fiamma
One of new york's best in just about every category
i loved the food, the service was impeccable and the decor to die for!!!! an absolute treat!!!
What a pleasure! I just got off the phone with the most intelligent woman to take my reservation! I only hope to meet the lovely Suzanne in person someday and thank her for helping us get into the restaurant at the last minute! The personal attention we recieved from these good people will insure we will be coming back time and time again! To Dina, Danielle, Sam, Tyrone, Brad and Suzanne - all my thanks!
Though it had a rough start with service, after several visits, it became apparent that they have worked out the kinks
The food is of high quality and and imaginative Italian flair
My most recent visit was thoroughly enjoyable
Try the specialty drinks as well!
The service was terrible
They were not gracious at the door
The hostess seemed confused
The bartender non-attentive
food wasn't anything special
Better than i even expected! The service was perfect
The appetizers were great and the food ad drinks were even better
Ambient is very nice and romantic, and tasteful
They got huge wine selection
I have been there three times, and the food is good and consistent compare to other place in SOHO, and can be better
Mostly people are not really there for the food
Service is very friendly, but a bit slow (3 hrs dinner) for faster pace New Yorker
Youre expected to pay more, and its worth the money for those formal dates, or just show off your out of town friends
Easily the crown jewel in Steve Hanson's empire, Fiamma manages to be sleek and homey at the same time--in looks and food
The dining areas are handsome, not hyper-designed, but it still radiates youthful energy, not old-world stuffiness
The food is refined yet earthy; the flavors are simple, pure and thankfully free of any nouveau pretense
Beyond the excellent food (the touted garganelli with prosciutto, peas and truffle butter really IS amazing), Fiamma's most striking--and pleasing--feature is the quality of service
From the reservations desk to the hostess to the headwaiter to the sommelier to the table waiter, everyone made the customer feel like a true VIP
And THAT is what often separates a good restaurant from a great one
Fiamma has all the right ingredients for many years of deserved success
This place deserves all the hype
From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the entrance is very nice
There is 2 floors and the elevator that takes u to the 2nd floor is really chic
All the courses we had (3) were amazing
The service was also was above what we expected and the price was reasonable considering the service, quality of food and ambience
The waiters were always on their toes, very nice and helpful
This is a unique place in NYC!
High-class service without the high-class attitude
Everyone from the Hostess to the Bartender to the Waiter to the Manager was so kind and pleseant
The food was excellent
We had the Grilled Octopus appetizer which was great! The special of the day was so tender
Steak Fillet with Fois Gras
unreal
We also had the Lobster with Pasta
great! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for tasty food and great service
Had read a couple reviews and decided to stop in for lunch
Started off with the tuna carpaccio - very smooth and silky, wished the olives had been a bit more salty for more contrast
Entree was the pasta with pancetta, peas and truffled butter - very good
Dessert - rhubarb compote, strawberry sorbet and vanilla frozen yogurt
Finished with a cafe correcto - espresso with a shot of grappa
It was a very relaxing lunch - enjoyable and best of all, not a scene
My family took me for my birthday
Fiamma was wonderful
Their signature drink-aFiamma- was terriffic
My son and I both enjoyed two of these raspberry treats
My main course, a dourade, was one of the best we ever had
Not anywhere near how New York Magazine described it
I wonder what they're ax to grind was?

Melon is a dusty old neighborhood tavern with green-and-white checkerboard tablecloths, old men who drink beer in the middle of the day and Irish waitresses who address regulars by nicknames like "The Commander
" The highlight of the pub-food menu is the burger--juicy, loosely packed and served on a small bun
The menu offers other standards as well: a turkey club sandwich, chicken salad, roast Cornish hen
Bartenders pour Coors Lite and Budweiser
JG Melon has some of the best burgers in the city
Skip Rare and all of the hype and go to JG Melons for really good fries and burgers
Not sure why people keep coming here
Burgers are okay, but not worth the price
We didn't encounter any rude wait staff, but the host was rude to other customers
If you want a good burger, go somewhere else
Best Burgers in NYC
Service is great, although you may wait a while for a table
Try sneaking a seat at the bar to eat faster
Fries, chili, beer
Everything is fantastic
Great for a casual date

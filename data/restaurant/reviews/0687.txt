Fast, correct and attentive
We were not rushed to leave
Overall, pleasant experience and I would go back
(There's no sign out front - look for the leafy tall tree planters in front
)
Some the rudest and tackiest service I've ever encountered


was literally told by the host, you can see we're not hurting for business
as for the food, the portions were on the small side and a few of the dishes we could not even eat they were so bad and some were just awful
and we had a reservation for six but were seated at a table for four, so we were cramped, too
overall


the worst dining experience i've had since i can remember
The food here is so bad
It hade the same menu as its sister sister restaurant, Cyclo, Anh and Nam
I won't come back again
I've passed O Mai hundreds of times but never knew what it was - it took a New York magazine review (best under $25) to get me in the door - and I'm glad I went
It had the same exact menu as its sister restaurant, Nam, which is another goodie, yet this one was less cell-phoney but just as delicious
Prices were right and the service was decent
The food is okay and the waiter service is quite bad - rushes us to finish our meal all the time
But the decoration of the restaurant is cute
Bad in every way you measure a restaurant: Service was poor (rude), ambiance was crowded and noisy, food was poor
Can get the exact same fare at your local Chinese take-out place and would probably be treated nicer
It's good to eat here for an early dinner before the evening rush
We got seated without reservations
Service staff was accommodating and the food was delicious
Try the beef with string beans and the tamarind margarita
I think that this resturant has done a fantastic job improving the service
The food is excellent, fresh, and very high quality for the price
I have been there a few times and have found that it is fun when with a few people or by yourself
I even sat at the bar for dinner once and chatted with the lovely bartender
Also, the angry, rude hostess is no longer working at the resturant
The atmosphere has vastly improved since then!
One of our most appalling dinners ever--the hostess is SOOO nasty! Wouldn't seat anyone (at all those empty tables) until we all arrived
there's no place to sit wait inside! She really went out of her way to be mean
The poor waiter seemed to have a lot of experience trying to apologize for the hostess
It's a pity because the food is rather good--innovative take on Vietnamese--and not too expensive, considering
We'll n-e-v-e-r go back
Food was excellent
Everything else disappointing
Perhaps they should focus on takeout
some of the food we tried there was a little strange--the dumplings are particularly strange: flat, one dimensional, not what you would expect a dumpling to be
the cocktails are interesting
the tuna roll appetizer is also really good and so is the warm bannana cake dessert
but be aware!--some of the food is a bit bizarre
The hostess and our waiter had real attitude
Although the food was fresh, it wasn't worth the obnoxious behavior
Don't waste your time
My friend and I popped into O'Mai on a Wednesday night at about 9pm
It was crowded, not packed; but the staff seemed overwhelmed and a little surly anyway
We got a table after a while, even though it seemed like tables were available pretty much from the point we walked in
The food was pretty good, but really nothing special
The staff was not very attentive or welcoming
The tables were packed together
The prices were ok, especially since the portions were actually pretty large
Overall, it wasn't a bad experience really, but it was mediocre at best
I don't see any reason to head back to O'Mai any time soon
We've been to O Mai twice now, and the food is awesome
Flavors are focused on, food is delicate, nothing is overdone, even the decor and wait staff are understated, cool, and very welcoming
The owner/manager (whomever she is) is another story altogether
Both times we've been, she's been trite, curt, and generally bitchy
Not sure what her problem is
I've worked in restaurants for years, and I'm pretty certain that being an all around jerk with a serious chip on your shoulder is not the best way to keep customers coming back
The food and our server(s) were very very excellent, prices were very good, but she's just left a horrible taste in our mouth both times
Try to go when she's not working
O Mai is wonderful
A hidden surprise
We've been there about five times already and it's really, really wonderful
The atmosphere is pretty and intimate (although small and somewhat tight)
Food is delicious
Try the many different appetizers
Make sure you share
try as many dishes as possible because most of them are all good
Wait staff and service is good
Hostess/Manager can be somewhat rude at times, but she is usually very pleasant
Make sure to make reservations because this place is getting great word of mouth!
The Scene At this sleek spot on a relatively sparse stretch of Spring Street, regulars belly up to a small bar and greet owner Giorgio DeLuca, of Dean and DeLuca fame, with warm hugs
The narrow space has a raw, sexy vibe, attracting a mix of moneyed Tribecans and city-savvy Soho shoppers who keep the wine flowing and the wood-burning ovens churning
The Food The owner has got an "in" with some of the city's best food purveyors, so the produce and seafood are as fresh as can be and the simplest dishes shine most
Ten varieties of oysters glisten on the raw bar
A shot of lemon juice and a little garlic is all the grilled octopus needs to become a star starter; likewise the addictive deep-fried artichokes
The coal oven pizzas should not be missed, nor should the odd but oustanding berry-mushroom risotto, which arrives perfectly toothsome
Desserts are rustic and delightful
I've dined here for lunch with clients numerous times, and it has never disappointed
While I'm not partial to precious-sized pizzas, theirs make a perfect appetizer for a small group
Very tasty
It's the risotto that keeps me coming back, although my friends tell me other dishes are very good, as well
Desserts? Divine
And with a very good cup of coffee, you'll trip out of there feeling like something special
Had a surprised birthday dinner here for a friend and it was great from the get go
Great wine list and the seafood platter was superb
The thin crust pizzas were also fantastic
Definately everyone had a good time and will be a return customer!
One of the best meals ever
The restaurant is cool but has the warm feel of a neighborhood restuarant
The waitstaff could not have been more friendly
Listen to their reccomendations! The food is TO DIE FOR! The raw bar selection combination was great! Nice presenttation of raw oysters,clams,and crab
Beautiful and delicious

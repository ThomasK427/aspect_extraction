Owners seem to be really great - -fantastic on the wines and awfully friendly overall
I love the stuffed calamari thing and will definitely be headed back!
I went with my friends one time to this little place that i really didnt expect much from it
But surprise I was very impress with the atmosphere and how friendly people are
The food its delicious and the desserts are out of this world and the wine menus its very good
I didnt know anything about wines but I got to try different wines from different places it was very cool! The hostess its just a dear and the server are so helpful when I didnt know something
Thank you Julie for the good time
My friend Peter took me to this lovely small winebar, he wanted to talk to me about his recent trip in Bhutan, he wanted to accompany his wonderful stories with a remarkable wine list and a tangibly tasty food
The conversation flew over couple of bottles of Aglianico, i found myself incapable of words in front of stuffed calamari and lamb three ways, meanwhile Pete was devouring his duck salad and his spaghetti aglio ed olio
The evening was a true libation, between the Buddist stories , the pannacotta, the sorbet and the bracchetto, which the funny looking manager kept on pouring at the end of the evening
Truly remarkable place, looking forward to do it again
everyone needs a place to unwind after a long day
a place where there's great wine, great food, and owners that feel like old friends, and a place that's equally fun to go alone as it is to bring friends
aroma is that place, your home away from home where the lovely couple vito and alexandra are always happy to see you
a wine-expert friend had brought us here when they first opened, and i have been back at least once a week since
treat yourself to the duck salad and the lamb three-way and congratulate yourself for making such a smart move
bring your first date here and get points for your subtle, yet enticing first move
bring old friends and expand the circle
just be sure to sit at the beautiful bar and leave your upturned noses in the upper east side (see previous two reviews)
Although brand brand new (i went before it had been open 2 weeks), Aroma is single handedly the best italian dining and wining experience I've had in downtown manhattan in a long time
The freshness of every ingredient of every dish combined with the chef's clearly skilled hand results in superb and original appetizers, entrees and desserts
The wine list has clearly been hand selected by an expert as well
And not to go unmentioned is the decor and ambience
the attention to detail has turned this tiny space into an amazing place to dine, or just have a drink
overall italian perfection
I stumbled on this place by accident one day and it has been my best find in NY to date
I am addicted to 2 Rivers
Everyday I go there for lunch and have such a difficult time deciding on what I want to eat because ALLLLLLL of the food is scrumptious
I have been there for dinner and the food is even more spectacular
It's worth making the trip to dine there
No regrets and the staff are super friendly
This place is tucked away on Murray Street
My girlfriends and I stopped in last night for drinks
Great find! We were seated promptyl, the service was great, and the staff was friendly
The ambience was very nice
It is decorated nicely and comfortable
I would definitely recommend this place for drinks after work
I found this place when I was shopping down town at Century 21
Not only was the staff friendly, but the food was phenominal
I had a great appetizer with a hearty entree that has made me a regular to this establishment
Three blocks north of Tribeca and i would have paid twice the price
Cheers!
This wonderful little restaurant tucked away downtown on Murray Street is a must if you're in the area
I have been here multiple times (for lunch and dinner) and each time I am more than pleased with the delicious variety of food, charming waitstaff and cozy ambiance
The chicken parm sandwich and pasta due fiumi are my favorites ~ don't miss out!
I have been to 2 Rivers a few times and am always happy with my meal
There is not too many good places to eat downtown so I couldn't have been happier when I stumbled upon it
I recommend the burger to everyone I work with, in my opinion, it is one of the better burgers I have ever had
The quesadillas are very good as well
I have been in for lunch and dinner and it is always a little more quiet at night although the food is still great
Nice place for drinks and dinner after work
The service is great and personable and the food surprsingly good for a neighborhood place
Try anything Mexican you can't go wrong
We came here for dinner in a party of four
The restaurant refused to take a reservation and we felt they were a bit rude on the phone
Upon arrival, we were seated within a few minutes
The restaurant is BYOB
The service is not exceptional but effective
The restaurant is very small (seats fewer than 20), clean, and conducive to a friendly conversation
It would also likely be good for a low key romantic evening
The food is above average
The steak and mussels were quite good
The fish, however, was not especially impressive
Overall, I would recommend this place if bringing your own wine is important to you
Best Burger Ever! The company is as good as the food!
This tiny restaurant in Ft
Greene is one of the hidden culinary gems of NY
I've been to Abistro a few times, and the food is simply delicious - a rare mix of West African French food
As a bonus, my boyfriend who is vegetarian had the choice of all the menu items as you can substitute any meat/seafood for tofu
It's also BYOB, which I think is a plus since you can bring what you like to drink for a lot less $$$
There are few tables, and each time I've gone, it was packed, so make sure to call ahead
You MUST try this place -- even though it may be a long haul to get there
The food is delicious -- a tasty combination of African, European and American flavors, with unusual ingredients (sorrell, palm sauce, maffa) and also favorites (fried chicken, salmon, bread pudding)
The dishes are plated beautifully, the service is friendly, the value is unbeatable, and the vibe is unique
Great for groups or dates
Loved everything about this place
The vibe was wonderful
Friendly, attentive service
But in the end, it's the food that gets you
I actually had a dream about the spiced fries
Plus you can get smaller portions, which gives you the option of trying more than one dish
It was BYOB which kept the check small, but that nonwithstanding, the prices were amazing
If this restaurant were in a fancier neighborhood, the prices would have been twice as much
But, the fact is, it's a family owned place, with great food, great people, and great prices
Go immediately
Went to Barna last night with a group of friends for a birthday
We went to the bar downstairs, although I understand there's a rooftop bar as well
The music is loud, very loud, but they play great music
People dressed in everything from sneakers and tshirts to suits and elegant summer dresses
There are hipsters talking to models talking to out-of-towners, which makes for a great experience overall, as everyone is approachable and having a good time
Drinks are a little pricey ($15 for a glass of wine!), but the beer is relative to Manhattan prices ($6 Heineken)
It was crowded, but not packed, which was even better
Not a pretentious hotel bar like some others I've been to (Whiskey Blue and the rooftop bar at the Gansevoort stand out)
I recommend it
A friend and i went to the roof on a Thursday night
The red wine sangria is bitter (first truly bad sangria I've had in NY) while the strawberry margarita is tequila with strawberry syrup
Drinks run $10-$14 and they are bad! Dishes are pretty good - albondigas, crab stuffed peppers, shrimp
If you're just going for drinks and tapas, expect to pay $50 per person
Overall, it's not worth the value
This place is very nice

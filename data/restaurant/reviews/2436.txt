We all very much enjoyed our meal, the service was excellent
Portions were more than enough for 4
Top it off with the Apple Crumble Dessert with icecream for a great finish
The only problem was that we were seated not too far from the bar and a customer was smoking
we could smell it from our table for a short period of time
no smoking should be allowed in the restaurant
I really like this restaurant
It's not too loud or too quiet
Great for groups; large portions, affordable
I thought the pasta w/eggplant was too oily, but chicken was great! The service was excellent! Have a great time!
I went with a friend from out the town - the best thing on the menu was the Veal
Everything else was mediocre
Not worth the dough!!
I went there with my fiancee's classmates
It's a family style restaurant
Portion is good and food and service are nice
Very nice atmosphere to eat and chat with friends and family
There are some dishes slightly on the salty side, but most are good
This place was a lot of fun
My wife and I went there with another couple and had a great time
Go with lots of people, the food is served family style and the portions are huge
One order will feed two with no problem and probably 3
So go with a group and sample sample sample
The atmosphere here is nice and the help quite pleasant
I would go somewhere else for dessert though
Enjoy
Two of us had dinner (yes 2) and it was delightful
WE did take home 3 extra meals with us but it was worth it
The special salad was so good - grilled veggies, shrimp, pricey but good
Couple of bottles of red wine - great
The eggplant parmagiana is highly recommended
Not so excited about the pasta with sausage - the pieces of sausage were too big hadn't taken up any of the taste of the tomato gravy which was what I imagined
No room for dessert this time - maybe next time
I'll definitely be back
The half size peking duck at this restaurant will amply feed two people, and it is one of the best that I've tasted to date! I order delivery from this place at least once a month
In Short Gray's Papaya might as well just call itself Gray's Papaya King
They both serve the same dogs, the same drinks (papaya, nonalcoholic pina colada), the've got similar seating plans (stand), the same intoxicating aroma wafts out of open doors, and the same signs boasting, "Our hot dogs are tastier than filet mignon
" The bottom line is that Gray's Papaya grills a quality dog, served on a toasted bun with good, spicy mustard
Can't beat Gray's Papaya for an excellent meal under $3
Two dogs and a juice for $2
75
Fun NYC experience
After having a quarter pound kosher hot dog for 92 cents on canal street and bowery, cant seem to appreciate grays price
The hotdogs are good but I don't really care too much for hotdogs
But if u ever run low on cash its the best way to fill ur tummy without paying over 5 dollars
And since it's so cheap, don't expect a clean place to sit down
It's basically a bigger version of a hot dog stand
Great if ur on the run and don't have time to wait around for food
And even better that there is no need to tip!
Grays Papaya is amazing anytime, but especially after a night of beer, friends fun
Definately can recommend
well,it's the best
i was in the queue and just a second i ordered and its already in my hand
i like the pineapple and fresh orange juice
regards to edmond,flor,alvin,paolo,rico and all the staff of gray'ppy,espclly to mariola
and by the way the music is good
How i wish to be there again
CARE FOR A DRINK
This is da place
Be careful if you are wearing a nice shirt
If you are a tourist, get a polite new yorker weenie button for only a buck
I love it
2 hot dogs and a weird-flavored drink (orange, grape, coconut champagne, banana daquiri, papaya) will put you $2
45 in the hole
I remember when it was $1
95! Anyway, I always get two specials and swallow them whole! Always get the special, as hot dogs by themselves are $0
75
The only problem I have are the vagrants that hang out there
They have the balls to ask for change
Just say no, and be on your merry way
I mean, this is a regular hotdog place
The weiners are too skinny and the only toppings they have are mustard, ketchup and that saurkruat stuff
What's so spectacular about that? I mean they could at least have chili and cheese
Sonic's hotdog's are waaay better but you won't pay 75 cents
Gray's Papaya's recession deal is the best
where else can you get the best hot dogs you've ever tasted and a drink for 5 bucks
Gray's is a great place late at night when everything else is closed
It feels like New York City
The price is right, the drinks are right and the dog is even right
This great if you need a quick and cheap lunch
However, don't look for your soda here
its all juice
The dogs are pretty good too
Though it looks shady from the outside, it has the best dogs in the city for a lot less!
great tube steak! the drinks are super and the help is very nice
Gray's Papaya is the definitive cheap eats NOT Papaya King at 86th St--Papaya King owner Gus Poulos has revealed his greedy side as there are at least 2-3 price increases a year on his food and foamy drinks--a tiny 8oz drink 1/3 foam is a buck--and the ''special'' 2 dogs and a med drink is slowly creeping torward $5--Gray's Papaya!! the real deal!!!!
I love gray's papaya there is no hot dog like it
The toppings are the best as well
I can't get enough of those dogs
Gray's Papaya is the best cheap dog place in town
Many a day after classes at NYU have I looked into my wallet and realized that I didn't have enough for a regular street vendor hot dog
All I had to do was walk down the street and enjoy the best and cheapest hot dogs in town
I'm really glad that this place made number one on this list
It would have been a travesty if it hadn't
While Gray's Papaya is a decent meal for a cheap price, it does not hold a candle to the real Papaya on 86th street and Third Ave
The hot dogs at Grey's are not the same and the drinks are imitations
Crunchy hot doga and pulpy orange juice
My sister used to take me here when i was a kid and she had to practically force it down my throat
sucks for vegetarians doesn't it? Gray's is the best stuff on earth and it's dirt cheap, and in NYC! what else can you ask for? crispy-skinned hotdog lovers come near and come far for these lovely treats! the staff ain't rude either :)
solid hot dogs and drink at a great price

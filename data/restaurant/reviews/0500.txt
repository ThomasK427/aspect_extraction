Wasn't so great this time, but Shania was starting soon and they were swamped
Don't bother telling how you want your meat prepared, it will come out however they get it to you
We'll go again as tired of Mustang's and the pubs around the Garden, but I just keep ordering different stuff hoping to find the sweet spot
when to sevens on friday after the knicks game
loved the decor and the chandlers, got seated right away by the friendly hostess and had a great time
the food is unbelieveable I had the skate the chef`s signature dish and my friends had the lobster risotto and the mother rib eye steak what a meal
They make great apple martinis and if you have room for desserts try the coffee doughnuts
A great place to go before or after a game kitchen open until 12
00pm  TWO THUMBS UP GREAT STAFF GREAT FOOD
Don't know if the bar is really that bad, BUT the food would more than compensate! Their grilled scallops, shrimp and pasta were delish!!! Even Arthur won't argue with that
If youre looking for a great restaurant in this neighborhoodyouve just found it
My husband and I ate dinner at SEVEN in a cozy booth before a show at Madison Square Garden
We both have a discerning palate and we were both very pleased
The show was at 8:00 and our reservations at 6:00
This gave us plenty of time to relax, share a nice bottle of wine, have appetizers and fresh oysters, plus a delectable fish dinner and luscious deserts
We even had time for coffee and a digestif! The food was delicious
The staff was friendly, and unpretentious
We even went back for a drink at the bar after the show
well be back
I came to this place because I wanted to see somthing new and a friend told me about this place
I came twice both times I recieved lousy service from the bartender the food is not that bad
They need better bar service
i came after work the first time
Then I came during a weekday I was off and was nearby so I thought I should give it another try but after the bartender was rude I just gave up on this place
Other than that it has the possibility of being better if the staff was better as well
If you want to go stay away from the bar
All I have to say is this restaurant is SO wonderful! The waiters, chef, bar tender, FOOD is out of this world
It's a half a block from Penn Station, which makes it easy to get to after their extradordinary wine list! Try their duck
I crave it everyday now
The atmosphere is wonderful, the people are attentive, and the food is simply GREAT!! They have the most beautiful chandeliers from Ireland, their bar is a 2-story mahogany
Very, very nice
Try the food and try the wine! I promise it won't dissapoint you! I try and go there every two weeks now and I live in Jersey
Perfect for pre-MSG (Madison Square Garden) affairs
If you're tired of going to the local Irish Pub (there are at least 3 in a 2 block radius) try Seven for a pleasant change
Excellant service from start to finish, decent food, nice atmosphere
I had the sauteed Salmon with zucchini in a lemon sauce
A little TOO lemony for my taste but the Salmon was cooked nice and medium
very moist
Foodwise I've definitely tasted better, however for pre-garden eats, this is the best in the area
The staff is well aware of the fact you are pretty pressed for time so they're VERY on top of things
not at all to the point of being annoying
VERY attentive and offer a nice experience all around
If you just want cocktails, there is a nice sized bar area as well as seating out front
Give it a shot
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
I love shrimp, but after eating shrimp from here I may never eat it again
Service was so slow, and when we finally got our food it was disgusting
There was no elbow room and the lighting was pretty bad
The only two good things about that night was that they gave my son a free balloon and when we finaly left
In other words TGI OVER
Resist the urge to go into this chain restaurant - walk around a little more and you will find something better! TGIFridays is fine in suburban America, but this Times Square location is not only grossly overpriced, but the service is slow (they seemed badly understaffed the night I was there) and the inside of the restaurant looked like no one had cleaned or decorated it since 1989
Food was overpriced and mediocre
Service was bad
The whole TGIF experience was crap
New York is a city of fabulous restaurants with great food drinks, ambiance and staff
TGIF was the only bad meal experience we had!
I have fallen in love! I am from CA where good mexican food restaurants are a dime a dozen
I have been disapointed with NY mexican food selection( Tex-mex eww)  This palce is quaky but fun
The food is AWESOME
sometimes I find myself going 2x a week
If you get a burrito get it wet! you will not regret it!!!!!
I used to go there every week for lunch when I was studying at the CUNY grad center, and after I introduced my girlfriend to it, we've been going there once a week whenever we're in the city
The food is very filling, rare for a place with such affordable prices
I personally love all the different kinds of salsa, and make it a point to use all of them every time I'm there
The service is usually prompt
My only complaint is that it gets cold there in the winter
This is a fantastic place for lunch
The service is quick
The food is absoutely delicious from salads to sandwiches to pizza and pasta
It is in expensive
I wish I had a Luciano's in my neck of the woods
On top of the fact that it never closes, the food is great and reasonably priced! Try the Brown Betty, the cognac pumpkin cheesecake, the chai latte, or the fresh lemonade
I've been there many times with friends and they've all loved it and we've never had poor service
It's such a laid back little spot!!
I'm a NYer where I learned coffee house in the village in the 60's
I've been out of NY 35 years and I still have the NY attitude
There ain't no problem with the helpd attitude, ya gotta a problem don't go there
I like this place a lot
Sure, the waitstaff isn't the most friendly or attentive, but it's a great place to go and get lost in conversation or a book
The panini sandwiches are some of the best I've had (particularly the salami pesto), the salad's always been fresh, the price isn't bad, and I like the decor(the computer phonebooth is a nice touch)
I've been there twice and both times, the service has been surly and unpleasant; also, the coffee is overpriced
I can't really think of any good reason to go here, given that there are about a million better places to get coffee in the Village
Amazingly this cafe has no use for return customers
I found this out the hard way
Just like the guy below, I visited frequently just after moving into the area
First they kept asking for tips - and then when I put tips into the jar at the register, they informed me tips in the jar go to the barista and I had to tip the waitress as well
Finally, one night I asked for my check - the waitress, who had served me many times before, wrote on my check in my face: Tips not included
If this is the type of abuse you are looking for, please go warm their seats
Others be warned
Highly recomended
:)  I recomend the coconut coffeee
yummy  the desserts are good too
People here spend hours working on their laptops and doing their reading
I spent hours there reading and my waitress didn't have a problem with it
The desserts there are quite good, too
The only thing is the seats aren't very comfortable
It doesn't seem to bother all the readers there however
The appeal of an always open cafe near my new apartment has brought me to the Esperanto Cafe three times in the past month

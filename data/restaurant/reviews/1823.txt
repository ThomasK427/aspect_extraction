for those who love pizza and appreciate a mouthful of delish!
Lombardi's pizza lived up to the hype
It was a day spent shopping and sweating all over Chinatown, Soho and Little Italy
Our pizza was wonderful, and so was the salad
It was unbelievably inexpensive to boot
I will definitely be going back to Lombardi's!
I never thought I'd say this, but this is really better than John's
I like it better than Grimaldi's, too, but that's really just bias
Is this the best pizza in New York? I don't know, but it's close enough for me
Pizza is outragous, and there calzones are to die for
They are so huge
I'm a little hesitant to give Lombardi's such a good rating because I may never find a table
The place is great
The food is some of the best in the city
If you're visiting and want the New York experience without spending to much
Lombardi's will exceed your expectations
Let me just get my only complaint about Lombardi's out of the way
The restaurant is very small and cramped and would not be appropriate for a large group of people
Their pizza is the best I've ever had, not just in NYC, and I've eaten a lot of pizza in my time
The sauce is zesty and a little sweet, and the crust is just slightly charred (not burnt, just a little black in spots, with a little crunch to it)
Honestly, I don't even think toppings are necessary because the crust, sauce and cheese are so good
But to each his own, right? This place is as close to perfect as a pizzeria can get
I might be a bit biased, living just around the corner, but this is pizza as you've never had it before
The fact that it's just about the only thing on the menu should tip you off - they aren't kidding
Every ingredient is as fresh as it gets, it's priced right, and I've never seen anyone finish the entire thing
It's a tiny place, but there isn't a wait - you go there to eat the best without any other distraction
the best pizza in new york (which some might argue means it's the best pizza anywhere)
absolutely the best pie in town
you got to try the peppers
Better than mom's, and mom is from Naples
Have it as simple as possible
Lombardis is by far the best pizza place in the city! I should know, as sampling various pizza joints is perhaps my most notable hobby! The wait, usually over an hour, is well worth it
Lombardis provides fresh coal-oven pizza with a variety of toppings to choose from
I opt for the cheese, as fresh cuts of mozzarella drizzle the top of a thin crust lathered in a zesty tomato sauce
delicious pizza, true gem (be sure to get some beer at Nolita's with a 50% off coupon while waiting to be seated)
Lombardi's pizza is amazing
I have been to about half of the other places nominated for best pizza in the city - everywhere from Manhattan to DUMBO to Coney Island
I have never been as impressed as I am every time I visit Lombardi's
The place is tiny, but well worth the elbow-bumping
Lombardi's is by far the best pizza I have ever tasted
Perfect crust, perfect toppings, perfect sauce
Unfortunately, I do not live in NYC, but I make it a point to eat at Lombardi's every time I'm in town
Any New Yorker that knows pizza knows that the best pizza in NYC is at Lombardis!
I love Lombardi's
The has a not-too hard thin-crust, and is made with incredibly fresh ingredients
If you like lots of tomato sauce, go for the extra sauce option
The white pizza is very good, too
especially if you like garlic
Thin Crust, coal oven, fresh mozzarella, basil, great sauce
Close to perfect
the pizza is excellent- for some reason i think it tastes better when they deliver it- probably because it doesn't come with their horrible waiters
probably not worth the wait on the weekend when pomodoro is a block away but worth getting for delivery if you are in the area or for dinner during the week
It is simply the best
No better Pizza in New York!
Hands down, one of the best hand tossed pizza's you'll ever eat
Service was ok, but the food and decktop dining was fabulous
A nice breeze, a good wine, and outstanding coal fired pizza
Whatta place!
If you can't get to Gimaldi's, Lombardi's is the next best thing
The pepperoni pie is top notch, but the sausage pie is not as good as Grimaldi's
The best in the city without compasison
One can taste it in the crust, sause and cheese
Always is the same everytime
I love it!
then head over to Di Fara's in Brooklyn! Unless you're a yuppie or a wanna-be New Yorker who thinks Lombardi's or John's has the best pizza
Order a square in Di Fara and believe it!
I had long awaited going back to Lombardis when I visited NYC last weekend
When we got there, our waiter was the least friendly person we had come in contact with our whole time there
He only uttered 3 words to us the whole time we were sitting there
what you want? The pizza is incredable, however if you want refills or at least someone that can speak
I would not suggest dining here unless you get a different server
In Short Hidden away behind this chic trattoria sits one of Soho's largest and leafiest outdoor patios
The neighborhood's style mavens flock to it, day or night, for simply prepared Northern Italian fare and a thriving post-work scene
Start with a selection of antipasti from the counter, or order off the lenthy menu, which includes everything from grilled calamari, arugula-Parmigiano salads, multiple homemade pastas, and whole sea bass baked in salt
I had a very unsatisfactory dinner here last week
I expected something fantastic, given the excellent location and usually discerning Euro-clientele
The food was sub par
In particular, the Halibut special was dry, banal and totally overpriced
To make matters worse, the service was indifferent and the atmosphere strangely muted
There are lots of great restaurants in this area
Avoid Barolo, which appears to trade purely on its location
I ate at Barolo this saturday and I must say it was a fantastic experience!! The place was packed, but we were seated very quickly and the service was superb! I ordered the apple ravioli which were very different and very yummy and my husband got the 'orecchia d'elefante', (translates: elephant ear!) a HUGE breaded veal chop right on the bone, served with avocado puree- a nice touch
I was surprised to see so many bad reveiews here on citysearch because I completey disagree with all of them
The staff was very attentive, the food was great and the wine list was impressive! Their beautiful garden is opening next week and I will definitely be back- can't wait!!!
My friends and I are always looking for a classy restaurant in the Soho area, and we found Barolo and we fell in love
The food is absoloutely the best thing ever
The service and whole decor is impecible and flawless
I cant rave about it more
If you want good service and a classy meal definatly go to Barolo
Don't forget about their fine wine assortment!
I've been to a lot of restaurants in NYC and this is one of the finest! Anything on the menu will make your heart leap with joy! The atmosphere is so elegant which is only further complimented by the courteous and knowledgeable waitstaff
I've also had some private parties there with family - excellent wine food and service
I had not eaten in Barolo in about 10 years and decided to try it on June 25, 2005 with 10 friends
The food is OVERPRICED and has NO FLAVOR at all
I had a pan seared fish for $29
00, it was tasteless, not even salt and pepper, the side was a small salad
I left hungry and poor
My other 9 friends were equally disappointed
They also charged us $9
00/bottle for bottled water, is Barolo's San Pelligrino better than the rest of NYC?! We spent $75

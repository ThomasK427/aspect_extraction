Waited on promptly and the staff are always very friendly
My husband and I happened upon this place really accidentally and couldn't believe what a gem we had discovered- in Woodside, no less!! The Service was outstanding, the food was everything we had hoped for and more! We told our friends about it after our experience and they are in love with the place- they have been there 3 times in the past month! Without hesitation the 4 of us agree that it has to be in the top 3 restaurants in the entire city in any category
As far as price goes I am never bitter to pay extra for quality food and service, it is when I go to over hyped Manhattan restaurants where the service is passable, the food is average and the prices are not in line with the quality of my experience that I feel ripped off
I live in wooodside and my friend told me about this place
It is in the middle of an industrial area but when you walk in the door you are transported to Italy
I was met at the door by who i think was the owner
He met my girlfriend and me witha huge smile and seated us
We sat down and was waited on by Dan I recieved the best service i have ever had (NO JOKE) He help us with menu choices wine selection made us feel tight at home
The food was perfect
I had the quail, the frisse and beet salad and the rabbit
Every bite was better than the last
Please check this place out it is a true hidden gem
I've been to this restaurant about a dozen times this year - with a date, with a group of friends
Food and Service has been outstanding each time with only one miscommunication on one order that was handled promptly and graciously
Great wine list, great advice if you're interestedin trying a new wine
the only downside is the volume of the entertainment that makes it impossible to have a conversation, but not too loud to be uncomfortable
I don't want to recommend this to others only because I don't want to have to wait for reservations!
Group of us ate there last week and it was packed
We did have reservations but unfortunatley the only thing that was lacking was a hostess to acknowedge us
We were quickly given comped glasses of wine until our table was ready
The food was done superbly
Highly recommend the Fettucine prepared table side within a hallowed out parm'g wheel
The wait staff was wonderful especially Danny
They ran low on a dessert wine we ordered and he was gracious enough to substitute with an equally good type and comped us on that as well
We are going back next week for their special Truffle dinner sampling
I'm sure it will be a most memorable night
For those who wrote it can be pricey, find a quality rest in NYC that isn't
Remember appetizers, entrees, desserts and liquor add up anywhere you eat! Enjoy the live music and eat well
I was extremely disappointed with the food
The portions were tiny and lacked flavor
I wouldn't recommend eating here
Although, I have to say that the staff and decor were the highlights of my night
I have been to Sapori D'Ischia quite a few times and always had a wonderful time
I don't understand the other reviews on here that bashed the restaurant
My wife and I went last night as they were offering a 6 course tasting menu for the first time
While it was a little pricey, the food was exceptional and the wines selected were wonderful as well
They will now be offering the tasting menu every day along with their regular menu
As always the service was incredibly friendly and prompt
If you do not choose to have the tasting menu, be sure to try the fettucine which is prepared tableside in a giant wheel of cheese and drizzled with truffle oil
Again, I don't understand the earlier complaints
The menu is generally limited, but evrything I have ever eaten has been excellent
And the service has always been superb
This place is just awesome
I don't know where to start-the food is outstanding, the service is perfectly nice, specially the owners son is doing an 100% professional job, the whole concept (trips to Ischia, truffle days, opera nights, etc
) is outstanding- I have been to many places of all different cuisines in the world-Sapori d'Ischia is a wonderful restaurant and the food is out of this world
No wonder that the Zagat highly recomments it-I will always go to this restaurant-while I am in NYC-as often as I am in the mood for perfect italian food or just in the mood for a magnificant night
This restaurant was horrible a small warehouse turned into italian restaurant in woodside that had no hostess at the front door,limited food choices and horrible service
I would not recomend this restaurant to anyone the price was too high and waiters that are very rude
I've never had this experience in the 20yrs of dining out this is the first and the last time i will eat there again!!
This resturant totally ruined our family dinner for Mother's Day
Totally ruined our Mother's Day
We made reservations for 10 people for 5pm and when our party arrived, we WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED AT ALL
No staff member acknowledged us when we entered the resturant, they were actually VERY rude! They were not attentive to our needs the entire time we were there
I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTURANT AND WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN
A grop of five of us went into orange valve
And the main lady that was in charge this have us dirty looks right as we came in
The whole time we were there she treated us very rudely
She came over to us and treated us very badly
Whenever we aked her for something or a question she was very rude and even began to argue with us
The customer service was terrible
My friends and I have vowed never to go back and neither should you if you dont like terrible service
Orange valve is a nice little bar in the Bowery
It has a nice atmosphere (orange!) but the drinks are not cheap, and not that nice
The service is good, because there is usually not too many people there
The seating is also therefore ample
My main complaints is that they take 10% when you starting playing Texas Hold'em and they let too many youngsters drink
I need a more refined atmosphere, but I suppose it is ok for the college crowd in the area
I spend pretty much everyday at OV, drinks are awesome, the bartenders are hott, what more could I ask for?
It is simply great! I went there with three friends today for Happy Hours and end up staying for dinner
The drinks were so good
I love their Lychee Martini
Many, many bar snacks can be ordered at 25 cents per piece! The owner and bartender was a sweet lady
We were having a good time and later on moved ourself to the table for dinner
The food were great and honest
The service was friendly and best of all, the price was unbelievably inexpensive
It's a MUST
Check it out
Orange Valve is probably the best bar that I've been to in a while
The bartender and owner treat you like family and that's just icing on the cake
The drinks are cheap and the food is even cheaper
$20 for happy hour will easily have you drunk by the time it's over
If you're in the singing mood they also have karaoke which also doubles as a party floor
Check it out!
Had my birthday party there Friday night, and although it was unusually packed that night which deteriorated service
everyone said they liked the place and how did I ever find it! They are very generous with their drinks, and it is NON-pretentious which is wonderful!! Highly recommended!!
great service w/ a smile
tasty appetizers
cozy atmosphere
definitely a place to just have fun and bring your friends!!
I have checked it out once and i keep going back
The food is great, the drinks are great
drinks are not watered down like other bars and the price is great
all in all its all great
Friendly staff and a fun place to hang out at
Cheap drinks with a smile
Bring your friends and expect to have a great time! I'll definatly be checkin this place out again soon!
Went there on a Thursday night w/ friends


and it was very impressive

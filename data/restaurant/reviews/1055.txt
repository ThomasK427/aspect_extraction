The bourbon burger is fantastic (and satiates even my boyfriend's big appetite!), the salads are hearty and delicious, the nachos are HUGE, and even brunch is good
Back in May I hosted a dinner party at Uptown for my roommate's birthday and we were extremely well-accomodated
We were given a quiet corner, our waiter was polite and attentive, and I felt as if we were treated like a priority in the restaurant
I hadn't realized until reading the reviews that Uptown was such a nightspot as well
I am definitely interested in seeing the other side of this restaurant!
My friends and I went to the Uptown Lounge based on their Zagats and Time Out NY reviews
When we first arrived we asked to have dinner at the bar/window area
The hostess informed us that it is louder at the bar area and more intimate (quieter) at the dining room and skylight bar
However, it was al little to loud for dinner conversation
We asked to change tables and were quickly accommodate by a very gracious manager
We had dinner for 6 at a large circular booth in the dining room
Everything was perfect
Our meals and apps were delicious
The entrees we had were better then more highly rated places (plus they are all under $20)
The service was spectacular
Uptown has a great appeal for both an upbeat bar scene, group dining, and a quieter lounge scene at the back bar
Great night out !
I have been removed from the singles scene for sometime, but from the looks of it Uptown can cater to your needs
Couples should not be discouraged as you too can have an intimate evening
Uptown has seating that can accommodate large groupsthe staff are very friendly
There is plenty to choose from the menu and the signature martinis pack a punch
The sangria was watery, missing key sweetness other elements
I would try it again for the 6 bucks
The BBQ skewers are a must
The Striped Bass was a tad fishy, but was remedied by the drizzled orange sauce
The mashed were ok as were the side of spinach
Hubbies filet mignon was tasty string beans crunchy
Dessert was definitely welcomed, with Apple Crisp (needed to be more warm) and chocolate cake
For under $100 a Friday evening well spent
Would definitely try the $45 special next time
I wrote a review about my last 2 experiences at Uptown (brunch Jazz Night), I am not sure what happened to the reviews , but both were very positive experiences
My boyfriend and I took our friends out for their engagement dinner
One word to describe our night: PERFECT
This place is underrated
It is packed all the time, but I do not think people realize the quality and orginality of the entrees
Prices are reasonable, drinks and music are great and service was actually with a smile
Manamgement knows what they are doing but try this: offer only entrees for 1 week at a lower price, once people try the plum duck, veggie wrapped cod, or pinot filet mignon : You will have dinner reservations until 2007
Great job and a great additiona to the area
I live in the neighborhood and frequently patronage the Uptown Lounge for early dinner and brunch with my girlfriends
The food is always great, but one thing separates Uptown from other places
The staff, owners, managers, and even the busboy go out of their way to help you
They truly go out of their way to make sure you are 100% satisfied
I recommended Uptown to my co-worker for her boyfriends surprise 30th
As an attendee of the party, I must tell you it was perfect
I usually do not go to Uptown late (have to be at work at 5 am), but the place was packed
Meg's party was a hit; everyone enjoyed the appetizers, drinks, and the atmosphere
As a classy gesture, the manager gave the birthday boy a $50 gift certificate to Uptown
You guys do it right!
I am a physician at Mt
Sinai hospital, just four blocks north of The Uptown Lounge
My colleagues and I had limited choices available to us for social gatherings and dinners
I stumbled upon Uptown via the Best of Citysearch results
We decided to have our monthly dinner at Uptown
I would rate this venue a perfect 10
The food, drinks, and ambience of this place is great
IMO the grilled shrimp and duck breast are delicious! The most important factor to me was the attitude of the servers, manger and bartenders
Believe it or not, everyone was polite, friendly and very attentive
Put all of these attributes together and you have the recipe for a great night out! I guess that is why this place is doing so well
One tip, if you have large groups, ask to sit in the skylight room, very impressive
I planned my friend's birthday dinner there because I saw the rating of 9
9 on Citysearch and figured that was a good sign
We ordered appetizers of coconut jumbo shrimp and spinach and artichoke dip, both of which were excellent
3 of the people ordered the Chicken Francaise and said it was wonderful
The turkey wrap was very fresh and delicious
The portions were large, and I ended up taking most of it home
Walking past the bar area, it's not the greatest scene for singles to meet other singles, because there were mainly couples, but in the restaurant area, there were all sorts of groups
The service was extremely friendly and attentive, and everybody at the table agreed that we would love to go back
After hearing great things from reviews, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday
The two of us ussually share our food, but we found ourselves reluctant to share because our food/drinks were so good
Definately try the duck and the uptown apple
Price were reasonable for the quality and quantity
Also, Katie the waitress, one of the friendliest waitresses thats ever waited on me
After eating, we took our time ordering additional drinks, and they just kept getting better
I'll definately be comming back
Recently I went to the UES for a dinner party with some friends
I had not heard of this place before and was slightly hestitant
When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised and realized why my friends had choosen this spot
Uptown has it all, food, ambiance, friendly staff, drinks and fun music
Uptown offers a lot of choices for all tastes and the apps are great! After our meal we went to the bar and closed the place down
And I highly recommend having a speciality martini and we are definitely are going back soon!!!
This is the only consistent place for good food and wine on the UES
If you need a break from all the Italian joints that populate the neighborhood this is it
Food, service, and prices are all above bar and my girlfriends tell me that the place is very sexy
That is good too I guess
Anyway, this place is worth a visit
-Alex
I must say that I was at first uncomfortable going to the UES for my girlfriend's birthday dinner party
Upon first entering Uptown, we were greeted warmly by both the hostess manager
The place was packed and we had an 8:00 reservation
My initial thoughts were we would wait at least an hour
To my surprise, our table was ready waiting, just as promised
Within minutes we had our drinks
The appetizers were excellent
Our table consisted of 4 couples and not one person found even a minor flaw
We tried each other entrees: I highly recommend the duck breast, tuna, gulf shrimp
Following delicious desserts after dinner drinks, we moved to the back bar (laid back less crowded then main bar) and stayed until 3 am
This place truly is a classy gem
Thanks again for a wonderful evening Josh Becca
Finally a great place to go (not only on the Upper East Side, but pretty much the east side of NYC)
The other reviewers are right: great/upscale food, fun atmosphere, great music, and the atmosphere is just cool

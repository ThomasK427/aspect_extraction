It's a tad overpriced, but pleasant enough that I'd go back at least once
I loved it
The is a great selection for vegetarians and it is inexpensive
All the food was great
I can't wait to go back
Don't listen to the bad reviews
The bistro is a great place
Their burger is out of this world
The best thing about them is that they are one of the most friendly, down to earth places left in New York
they always make you feel at home
Additionally, they have a great happy hour from 4-7 which includes premium drafts!!
As much as I enjoy taking the time to have a relaxing Sunday brunch, this was ridiculous
I'm still not sure who our waitstaff was, and am not sure he or she knew either
It's a shame because the food is very good
I feel sorry for the chef for creating a lovely meal, and then having it ruined by the staff when it leaves the kitchen
Please, PLEASE, hire new waistaff
Wandered in here after a show
It's a cute little place, outdoor seating, typical, if pleasantly underpopulated inside
But I was amazed to find that the Said plate, Mediterranean appetizers, was really tremendous -- some of the best felafel I've ever had and a very tasty tabouleh, as well
The pinot grigiot (by the glass, yet!) was also quite good
All in all, an unexpected pleasure
The Scene This small, plain-looking place offers a nice entry into the sweet, spicy and sour flavors at the heart of Southeast Asian cuisine
Though decor seems like an afterthought--a neglected karaoke machine hunches in a corner, a poster advertising Thai beer hangs from a wall--fresh-cut flowers set on the tables reveal an air of earnestness
The Food Both the uninitiated and the expert will find much to like in Pam Real Thai's well-organized menu, which offers nice descriptions of each dish
Start with hae kern, a deep-fried, bean curd-wrapped shrimp paste spring roll served with a sharp plum sauce
Large course highlights include the yums, or salads
The crispy duck yum, for example, makes for a finger-licking melange of pineapple, duck, red onion, scallions and cilantro
A pleasant burn remains long after the last bite
The food is good but the decor needs to be improved
Good Thai food
The menu contains the variety of Thai dishes

We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods
Why? They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money
please don't fool us
I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the cuisine
The Thai food is good
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time
The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces
A defitely must visit
Went there for an office lunch
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
Try green curry with vegetables
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied
The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for
Simple hole in the wall but decent food for the price! Nice service-can be a long wait when busy and take out takes a while some nights!
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
It was wonderful
the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing
too large for just two people but nothing was left
Unbelievable
Stared with chive dumplings fried, which were not really crispy and bland: one of the three was still cold inside
I had the cashew beef, which was very good: it was not overwhelmed with nuts and also had carrots, lemongrass, pineapple, and baby corn
My guest had the chicken with chili paste and green beens
Unlike my dish, his was very dry and spicy--the menu does not specify the spice level and the service does not ask your preference
Service was mediocre, as they forgot my Thai tea and only one seemed to speak english
I think this place is hit or miss, but be sure to ask if you don't like spicy
First of all, I would like to say that I am from Bangkok, Thailand
Born and raised there for 19 years before moving here
I went to eat with my friend
We are really disappointed with the food
we ordered Crispy Duck Salad, Fish with Garlic Sauce, Steamed Mussels, and Crispy pork with chinese broccoli
Everything tasted too strong
We asked them to tone down the taste a little bit after first bite of duck salad
They replied, this is how we cook the food here
The portion of the food is too big
If you are going to order fish - make sure you have about 5 people to eat it
Just order 1 dish each
Appetizer size is the size of a main dish
Size of a main dish is actually for 2-3 people
Definitely NOT recommended!!!!
I've only eaten here once, but the experience was pretty bad
Let me just tell you: DO NOT GET THE VEGITARIAN DUCK! It's vile and not edible at all! I tried to return it (after barely managing to eat two bites) but they wouldn't let me
I ended up having to pay for the nasty stuff! I realize that this place has a huge menu and, therefore, will have some not-so-good things, but it's the rudeness of the service that gets to me
I will never EVER eat here again
On my second trip to pam's, and after a visit by some friends, on my recommendation, it became apparant that this restaurant needs to hire some decent help
They act as if they are doing you a favor, and with such small tables, they should keep the tables clear of unneeded glasses and plates, which they repeatedly did not do
Also, forget the whole fish (too dry) and the BBQ appetizer (portion was way too small)
For those of us who do not want to spend too much in any of the touristy restaurants around the theater district before a show
this place is PERFECT
The food is just above average for Thai food, the service is great and the location is key
It is BYOB - which we didn't know until we arrived but you can walk in with your own six pack of Bud and enjoy a beer with dinner
The food is ab it oily but all Thai food is oily
The appetizer we got was just ok, my boyfriend wasn't a big fan of his duck but my Pad Sweet Sour Chicken was extremely yummy! The place isn't much to look at but it is a great find
I love this place
Great food, Great price
Most of the menu seemed in the 7-8 dollar range
Which is impressive, because it is so good
However, It is a really basic, dingy atmosphere, far from romantic
The food was pretty salty, seemed like a lot soy sauce (You could probably fix that, by asking for them to cut back the sodium when you order)
I like the sodium, but some might not
Besides that, I couldn't believe how good it was for the price
Like a lot of places on 9th avenue, the food is good and the price is right

Maybe I just caught them on a bad day or something, but I;m definately never going to that place again
Its hard to find an authentic Indian restaurant with perfect chinese blend
but I cant have enough of this place
I love the chilli paneer and chilli chicken
the could work on the wine list though
also could use a new refrig for the beers to keep colder
??
Place is small, everyone is quite close to each other but the food is good! They don't take call ahead names nor do they make reservations
I am not South Asian but I have friends who are
One turned me on to Chinese Mirch and it is some of the best food that I've ever had, particularly the vegetarian dishes
I've brought other South Asian friends there and they all love it and say that its authentic
Its not for people who can't handle HOT food and it gets really crowded and can be rushed, but its awesome
They are adding a second floor so maybe service and ambience will improve
They also deliver
It's OK at best
I had Indianized Chinese for the first time while on business in India
Mirch doesn't compare to that experience
It's also very small, cramped and loud
And the only one I've found
For years, I've been saying the best Chinese food I've had was in India--Chinese Mirch does an excellent job bringing Indo-Chinese (Chindian) fusion cuisine to the states and New York
As the name suggests, the food is spicy, yet not overwhelming and each dish has it's own unique taste
The service has been better in the past and the waiters can be a little pushy, but all in all, this restaurant is kick ass and there's a reason why I go there a least once a week
If you haven't been there: go now and you'll know what I mean
I have recently come from visiting India and still have the taste of Golden Dragon's (five star hotel restaurant) crispy fried vegetables on my tongue; let me tell you, Chinese Mirch is really comparable
I felt like I was back in India again
I was vegetarian when I visited Chinese Mirch, and they did not disappoint me with their menu
Three of us ordered two entrees, two appetizers, three drinks, and two desserts
We spent about $20 each and it was worth every penny! Try it!
I have been to Chinese Mirch several times and have enjoyed every experience
The food is great and perfectly suited to the Indian palate
Of course, if you like Indian chinese, this place is a must
However, if you have never tried Indian chinese, but like Indian and Chinese foods, you shoudl definitely give it a try
The service is kinda slow, so do not expect to be out of these in a hurry
However, the food is definitely worth the wait
And I suggest making reservations, esp on weekends
There's Chinatown chinese, the real deal, and then there's Indian chinese - infused with the spicy, tangy taste of Indian cooking
Among all the places nearby that offer this cuisine, I was really impressed with the quality that Chinese Mirch offers
From sushi plates and a nice decor to the faithfully reproduced flavors of Chilli Chicken and American Chopsuey, this place is well worth the money
Highly recommended: Chilli Chicken, Singapore Rice Noodles, Garlic Prawn
Don't recommend: Drums of Heaven Chicken
Suggested order: 3 entrees for 4 people is perfect
Average cost: about $15 per head for dinner, w/o drinks
This is one of the first Indian Chinese restaurants that I have found in Manhattan that truly matches the exact taste of this unique cuisine from India
The fried chilli prawns and chicken drumsticks as an appetizer or entree are fire hot, so request the chef to cut down on the spice if you are not used ot it
Indian chinese is known for it's spicy ecclectic twist of Chinese made with Indian spices, so it tends to be spicier than Indian or Chinese food
The restaurant it kind of cramped so make a reservation, however it's a cuisine worth trying especially if youa re a fan of Indian and Chinese food
In Short With a decor of dark wood, leather upholstery and soft lighting, this clubby steakhouse has a warm, upscale feel
The menu's focus is prime beef (aged up to four weeks), from bone-in rib eye and filet mignon to New York strip drizzled with bearnaise sauce
Classic seafood offerings include lobster tails, steamed crab legs and wild Alaskan salmon; sides, served a la carte, include baked potato and chipotle mac and cheese
TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT! A beautiful day with the family was totally spoiled
In short, total lack of professionalism and respect for individuality
It was made clear that these magnificiant surroundings? were too expensive for family occasions
To add insult to injury the food was less than the corner deli's staples and ultimately the shrimp cocktail was literally dumped on our backs
The response from management, Here is my card for your dry cleaning bill
Needless to say, You can't judge a book by its' cover A fine appearance does not equate with complete excelence and in fact may be hiding total mediocrity
First time there, on July 24th, we were seated right away
The decor is nice and the view was beautiful
The food was excellent, and the wine was delicious
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE A STEAK LOVER
do not waste your money or time, service was slow, food was average the wine choices were OK
Been here two times and have to say this place is awesome!!! The service is pretty good
the manager remembered us from our first visit, and the servers are very efficient
Great wine list, although a little pricey
The steak --- well, this place made me a regular at steak houses! I recommend the prime ribeye, crab cakes, and the onion rings
Also, don't forget the chocolate covered mints on your way out!
We celebrated a birthday here and the experience was wonderful
The service were exceptional and the food though a little pricey was incredible from the appetizers and salads to the desserts
The steaks were seasoned to perfection and were so tender you almost didn't need a knife
I would highly recommend this restaurant
A lovely addition to lower Tribeca, Ceci-Cela serves top-notch pastries, baked goods, sandwiches and gelato
The yellow walls and small tables of this patisserie are very inviting, and service is nice and casual
This is a great place to stop by for a delicious treat or to catch up with a friend over a coffee and a sublime chocolate almond croissant
Lovely pastries
scrumptious chocolate eclairs and napoleons
Not too sweet
just right
I am surprised that I'm the first one to review this place! I'm a true pastry lover
and Ceci-Cela's pastries are simply divine! Actually I buy so many pastries and cakes from that place I have to make an excuse to do so
For my dad's bday I got him a chocolate espresso cake and we abs loved it
Not too sweet, but sweet enough
I also heard rave reviews about their strawberry shortcake
Their cakes range from 20 to 30
def worth a try
Having first stumbled drunk upon this place one night, and loving it then, I have since returned in less alterered times to confirm a FANTASTIC crispy thin-crust pizza from this small basically take-out shop with a few little tables
An absolutely perfect slice on the go
This is a best kept secret wine bar/cafe
The ambience is great, and feels French
The lights are bit too dim at night and there's only one bartender but it's an intimiate place for a date or with a small group of friends
You can have a cup of coffee (large portion) daytime and read a book there, or play Squabble with friends
Nighttime you can share some baquette with olives and white wine with a date
I enjoy my time there every time I go
Best bets are the pulled pork and the beef ribs
Ask them to go easy on their tangy bbq sauce, which can overwhelm
Also, the platter size portions are huge
The seating area is TINY, dark, and spartan, best for a group of 4 people max
Be advised: Not only is it slow-cooked food, it takes a while for the order to be prepared so plan to chill out here
A big plus: The people in the shop are genuine and enthusiatic about their food
This is one of those places that everyone thinks THEY discovered, but soon realize it's no secret
This place has GREAT BBQ!!! I went on a recommendation from a friend and as soon as I got there
WOW!!! the smell of their BBQ sauce hooked me immediately

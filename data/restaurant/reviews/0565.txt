I like the service and the food presentation
Each entre came with a side of rice and bread (most places you have order the bread separately), dal (lentils) and fresh vegetable
I like the non-traditional dcor and atmosphere
Cute date place and good to meet a group
It is pricey
The veggies dishes start at $17
00!!
I had a terrific dining experience at Amma
The service was excellent--waiters were courteous, prompt and helpful
The owner of the restaurant talked with customers and was very helpful
The decor was great--warm colors, nice lighting
And more importantly, the food was delicious--I had an incredible chicken dish with onion kulcha
Prices were pretty good considering the location and the amount of food given is huge! Try the kulfi for dessert-you won't be disappointed
Very nice place to take your date to
Perfectly seasoned spices complement the very sexy decor of this newcomer
This by far was my favorite Indian Restaurant I have EVER been to
Each dish was excellent! We had their specialty drinks as well which was great! To top it all off the ambiance was romantic
I would reccomend trying this place soon
because soon you won't be able to get in
This was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had
The food was delicate and delicious
The service was amazing
Ambiance was lovely
The manager offered for me to come in the next day and try a special dish for FREE
Attended a Party there yesterday and found the place to be gem
In my books it is a three star rating
The food was extremely good, the service was excellent with a smile and Ah the music went with the great ambiance
I had the Bhel Puri, and the Lamb Shank curry
The lamb had the right spices and the meat cooked just the wat it should be
I recommend this place over any other Indian pricy place
It was a bit pricy but worth every penny
we went there on my huscand's b-day and they made the evening more than special! the food, decor, music, service, everything was superb! had a great time!
Pretty good food, pretty good decor, polite and quick service, but I don't see how the previous reviewer only spent $28 for dinner for 2
Average entree on the menu was about $20, appetizers are around $8 which is comparable to other resturants in the neighborhood
You get plenty of food for the price though
Went for lunch
Decor + ambiance was cool, food was great
Oh, and only spent $28 (incl tip) for app's and entrees for 2 people
Wow
This stylish East Midtown restaurant delivers the best and most reasonable vegetarian lunchboxes
The service is excellent
Great music, too
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited
A must for all the Dosa lovers
In Short This 220-seater is known as much for its colorful cocktails as its contemporary French-Mediterranean menu by chef Cedric Tovar
While the downstairs bar attracts a younger, hipper crowd, the upstairs dining mezzanine draws serious business types
A gypsy-inspired decor gets its cues from thousands of strands of glass beads hanging throughout the window-lined space
Appetizers include foie gras, squid and quail; bouillabaisse, lamb and lobster are among the choices for dinner
Some folks may consider this upscale, trendy midtown located restaurant to be amongst the get what you pay for type, but I can assure you its much less than what you should get
The portions were small (even smaller during Restaurant Week), service was rushed, and the prices don't justify the kind of bland taste and limited menu options
This restaurant aside from its beautiful decor, was strictly average at best
The bread that food servers bring out during the course of the meal are fantastic (raisin bread yum!) as are their exquisite desserts
One shouldn't have to fork out so much and get so little in return
Truly a major disappointment
My boyfriend and I went last weekend
There was live music at the bar, which made our wait for a table wonderful (we didn't have reservations)
The duck was unbelievablly mouthwatering
First of all, the place is absolutely gorgeous! The staff and waiter are very polite and friendly
And the food was great! Also very romantic
I'm always one to accentuate the positive, but after taking my wife to Django for her birthday dinner, I had nothing to say but my apologies
The decor was aged, the food was very average, and the wines that accompanied the 5-course tasting menu were mostly awful
The service attempted to be accomodating, but was clearly amateur
Even the bartender made my Manhattan with Scotch instead of Rye or Bourbon
When I drop $250 on dinner for two, I expect MUCH better
Next time I'll stick with the tried-and-true
The restaurant is absolutely beautiful
I went for lunch and the food was surprisingly good
The duck was juicy and the salads were perfectly dressed
But it was the dessert that blew me away
The mixed fruit sorbets were amazing as was the carrot cake with cranberry sauce
I would definitely go back just for the desserts!
Being a Brooklyn girl, the midtown address didn't appeal at first, but I got over it when I heard about the incredible food and downtownish decor
Entry into Django is like entering an exotic dream world
A beautiful staff greets and guide upstairs into the dining room filled with ecclectic mixes of color, texture and elevation
The food follows the same format
Foie Gras with tart dried apples, poached lobster tail atop homemade parpadelle pasta with a hint of refreshing mint and tuna tartar so fresh it pops in your mouth
The deserts were not to be missed, the wine list outstanding
Overall, a great dining and visual experience
I always look for a place where i am comfotable with my parents, celebrating a friend's birthday or simply having a romatic dinner for two
Django is my go-to midtown spot for all of those occasions
D-lish!
The restaurant menu was great
Avoid the fish because it was nothing spectacular but I had a lamb dish that was to die for
The appetizers and the dessert were DELICIOUS
I would recommend this place for a special night out
A bit too pricey for a regular meal but worth the trouble for a special occasion
The waitress was a bit slow but it was a Monday night so I assume they aren't staffing their best
But the hostess was extremely hospitable
there was always someone there to wait on you
whether or not your waitress disappeared
When items on the menu average over $30, you expect a level of service that is attentive and food that is special
I ordered a steak with a glass of merlot
The steak was a stew, overcooked and burnt, and since the wine took so long to be served, I canceled it
The bar downstairs was beautiful, as was the dining space
But the food and the service was subpar
They need help
Having been to many top NYC restaurants, I was surprised that I had never heard of Django before but I am glad I went to try it out
Sharp looking bistro with outstanding food and a very helpful sommelier

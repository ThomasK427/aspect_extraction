I don't want to dis the place but they do not deserve to be so highly praised all the time
I am convinced it has something to do with the fact that people must get liquored up while they are there and the chef could fry some cat food and people would eat it up and applaud
All bar food tastes good after you have been drinking
Stop the insanity!
this is not your place
This may seem obvious, but for anyone likely to be dragged here by others, let me give you fair warning
Though I am told by many the burgers are good, there are no other charms to be found here
The non-burger menu items--grilled cheese, grilled chicken--are disappointing
And it's dark, dirty and frequented by cockroaches
Corner Bistro has the BEST burgers in the city
that's it, end of conversation
I always eat at the bar: a burger, fries and a pint of McSorley's
Always satisfying too
I've seen cockroaches crawling the walls here more than once
I'm not complaining
I like the simplicity of the Corner Bistro
The menu is pretty much hamburgers
Cheese? Your choice yes or no but it's cheddar
That's it
French fries are strictly on the side
Corner Bistro does one thing and they do it right
The joint's reputation for a great burger is well-earned
This place is a must the next day after a big night out
Yeah, it's on a corner, but it's not your typical bistro--which is both its charm and its downfall
It's a fantastic little dive for a brew and a cheap burger, but NYC's best burger -- let alone the country's -- it is not
I've been to Louis' Lunch, I know
In Short In the summer, hordes of after-work drinkers pack the patio of this Tex-Mex restaurant, which is housed on the second floor of an office building
In winter, tables are crammed into the two dining rooms, dubbed Texas and Mexico
Ceilings are high, and the floor is carpeted
The menu, aside from few surprises like swordfish, offers the usual taco, burrito and enchilada fare
A truly grande margarita selection includes offbeat flavors like wilderberry and pomegranate
The Mexican food here is good although I have had better
Food comes in huge portions so men, you will not be left hungry
Prices are decent
The high ceilings make for a nice dining space
The part that was most enjoyable? The warm tortilla chips, guacamole and spicy salsa you get at the beginning of the meal in place of bread
I've heard a lot of good things about the happy hour and Margaritas here but, have never actually had
During the summer it looks like a great area to have drinks outdoors
Not only do they have a real dead buffalo hanging from the ceiling (what more could you really want after that?) but they have a slew of different margarita flavors and 2 sizes for the lethal drinks, which is great for the tequila-shy
If you go for drinks with work buddies, definitely DEFINITELY order a couple of steak nachos
The meat is tender, juicy and charbroiled
You won't regret it!
Appallingly bad service and food; they substituted romaine lettuce for spinach on the mushroom/spinach quesidilla; when brought to thr manager's attenetion - he said we do that - half and half - you bit into the wrong half
One of my most favorite places in the city
Always a good time from dinner with the folks to a start of a big night out
Margaritas are cheap and strong so the perfect place to begin the night and keep your expenses low
Not the greatest for date or nice atmophere
its the prefect place to go with a few friends or family and eat cheap great mexican food where you can relax and just have a good time
Happy Hour is great as well when its nice out because there is a big open area outside
This has become, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city
Starting with the free chips and medley of salsas and guacamole, the rest of the menu is strictly great mexican
As I continue my quest for the perfect mole sauce, El Rio comes in at the top of my list with the perfect sweetness and spice
The margaritas are a reason to come in itself
Order them frozen or on rocks, they know how to make a good one
Reasonably priced and a great atmosphere for a good time or a small party
The Margaritas at El Rio Grande can easily put you on the floor, but in a good way
The space lends itself to having a good time, which is unavoidable after the first drink
No kidding, one margarita is enough to make you tipsy, two puts you well on your way and three may bring out some sort of good time personality in yourself that you didnt even know existed! Either way, it is a fun experience
I have never consistently seen so many of my friends have such a great time on such a regular basis
This is a place that I recommend to anyone
Just make sure that you dont have anything important to do the following day
What do the bartenders put in those things, anyway????
My friends and I have been coming here for years
The reason: GREAT MARGARITAS AND GREAT FOOD
You will not find better or stronger frozen margs than here
The food is amazing and has a health-ish kick to mexican
You can finf broccoli and zuchini in your burrito that add this refreshing zing to it
Reccomended to share the burrito because it is HUGE! Even after sahring you are over-stuffed
I do admit it gets extremely crowded but that's a good thing
Means the food drinks service and ambiance are great or else we wouldn't keep coming back
The staff is extremely attentive and friendly
Definitely a place to start off the night
went here for just drinks after work midweek and sat outside
place was packed
drinks were really weak and everything comes in plastic solo cups - even wine and martinis - for some reason its just not the same
i actually had to send back a mixed drink because it was all mix and no alcohol - i never ever do that
staff was rude and slow
waiter would bring out your beer in the bottle but then the bouncer would yell at you for having a bottle outside
very cheesy crowd - everyone looks very BT
one stall in the only girls bathroom - just imagine the line
I've been going to the Mexican side of Rio Grande for almost six years
I've never been disappointed with the food, the drinks, or the service
When I first moved out to NYC from LA, I was desperate for a Tex-Mex type place and Rio Grand really fit the bill
They have fantastic nachos, good chips and salsa, and wonderful entrees
I always get the sopapillas for dessert
The place, (especially the Texas side), gets really crowded on Thurday nights and weekends
You will probably need a reservation during those times, but if you are dropping in in the early evening, or some afternoon, the place is nearly deserted and has an almost Zen-like ambiance
They have a pretty good brunch at well
This is a good place for small groups 6-8 people
Larger than that and you are really cramped and it is difficult to hear each other talk
These people crammed tables in here and it's so tight you can barely move around from table to table
I was knockin arms left and right with the people eating at our table
Waiters bumping me in the back walking by
Take out some tables
Food was bland with no spice, but the margaritas are good and strong
Never one to turn down a challenge when it comes to beverage consumption, I met up with friends at The Big River and promptly learned the margarita hype was on the level -- they'll floor you and they're great! The food is good, but nothing tremendous, although it's tough to resist the terrific free chips and salsa
But whatever, that's not why you go to El Rio
At the new location (on 52nd + 8th or thereabouts), they played host to a bumpin' birthday bash for a friend, and were open to any suggestions to spice up the night
The margaritas were just as tasty, but not quite as strong
I advise you visit the original location on 38th, but either spot is a can't-miss type of place

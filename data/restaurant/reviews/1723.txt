i'd go back
though i think the food at mesa grill is a bit more compelling
Same as Mesa Grill, good food but terrible hostess
At Mesa Grill, the person who answers the phone always asks you to hold on line
At Bolo, you wait for your table even your friends have arrived
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE HOSTESS THAT YOU WANT TO BE SITTED!!! How ridiculous! My friends and I were standing at the bar for 15 minutes when the restaurant was almost empty
We stood and stood until the bartender told me that I have to tell the hostess that I want to sit down!!??
I'm sorry to say that the experience left very much to be desired
The food was average and the service was mediocre
Maybe I was just expecting too much
While I love Bobby Flay, Bolo left much to be desired
The tapas were not as good as they could've been and the paella was not the experience it should've been
Even the dessert tasted like a cake you would buy in a grocery store
The service was good though
Terrible service, rude hosts, tacky decor, mediocre food - that pretty much says it all about Bolo
We had a wonderful experience at Bolo last night
I do not recommend the tapas due to the size of the portions but putting that aside, everyone had really good meals, the service was good and we weren't rushed out of the restaurant
Our party of 8 was at the restaurant for 2 1/2 hours
I had the lamb shank which was one of the best I've ever had
The restaurant is small and it was a little cramped at our table but it really didn't matter
I went with a friend during NYC Restaurant week and we both wanted to check out what Bobby Flay had to offer
We sat down at 6:15 for dinner, and we were paying the bill at 7:15! Everything was soooo rushed that three courses seemed like one assimilated course
I didn't even have time to finish my single cocktail and the waiter didn't even ask if we wanted coffee but instead, gave us our check without us even requesting it
As for the food, it was definitely ecclectic and unique (fried squid stuffed pepper with tuna), but the anchovies with orange I could have done without
I don't know if they were rushing because of the week, but we definitely didn't feel a relaxed dining atmosphere
The food was outstanding, perfect in every sense
The Spanish wines offered were of the best quality
Bobby Flay is one of the best chefs in America, he is also a very kind and friendly host
His employees must imitate him more
Since my last review, I have returned to Bolo twice - once for lunch and once for dinner on a Saturday evening
On both occasions the food was fabulous and creatively presented
Service at lunch was attentive and pleasant
On Saturday evening we were seated immediately upon arriving, the staff was a bit harried as every table was taken, over all a do-again experience
It has been several years since I have been to Bolo and I am happy to say that it is still as great as I remembered
Bobby Flay still continues to create some of the most innovative food in NYC
The entire staff was very accomodating and the Apple Flan is one of the best desserts I have had in a long time
Just last week I went to the Mesa Grill with a friend for dinner
The food was excellent there
I thought I would give Bolo a chance as well
Sure enough the food was just as good
I would recommend the restaurant based on the food
However, the wait for the food was horrific
We had sat down at our table at around 9:30pm
The appetizers came at a timely fashion
Unfortunately, we didn't get our main entree until just before 11:00pm
It was ridiculous
Even some of the staff that was working that night was served their dinner before my table got our dinner entrees
A near failure on Flay's part
When a chef gets too big for his britches this is what happens
Poor food quality, inconsistent food temperature with each course (cold ingredients in a piping hot paella shows me 1-all ingredients aren't cooked together as they should be in paella 2-no executive oversight as to what the sous chefs are up to), tacky decor, and lackluster service
Save your money and head elsewhere
After enjoying many meals at Mesa Grill, I was expecting a similar experience here
Major letdown-the menu was unexciting and the food was bland
While the atmosphere and decor was pleasant, our server was unattentive and downright rude when asked questions about the menu
B ottom line- Bolo is majorly overrated and overpriced
Looks can kill, but this little Irish Pub is not only a bang for the buck, but the crowd is ok, and the waitstaff are super friendly! Great lowkey place to invite a lot of friends for a birthday!
The Scene A small unassuming facade hides the seafood treasures inside
Nautically themed decor of replica boats and maritime paintings line the walls, creating a true Cape Cod feel
A free-standing fireplace warms the back room and lighted candles are places on white tablecloths
Servers are knowledgeable and extremely helpful
The Food The menu embraces a subtle Asian theme throughout
Oyster choices consist of selected Atlantic and Pacific varieties, including the Long Island-raised Shaffer Cove oyster unique to the restaurant
Shrimp dumplings with a curried Thai sauce provide an interesting mix of sweet and salty
The pan-seared scallops over asparagus mushroom ragout are divinely enhanced with truffle cream
Seared tuna and wasabi mashed potatoes drizzled with orange coriander reduction are also flavorful
End the meal with the tangy lemon tart
As I waited at the bar for my date to arrive the bartender served me promptly and also knew the other customers at the bar
She made sure everyone was happy and taken care of
When my date arrived we were seated immediately
The service was excellent
I've been to many places in Manhattan where the service could care less
The service here was excellent
Friendly and accomodating
When the food arrived everything was excellent
I suggest the Pan seared shrimp with pea risotto for small dishes
So excellent words can not describe well, maybe mmmmm
Being from New England, I'm very picky about seafood
I must say- this is the first place in Manhattan that has impressed me
We had a few East Coast varieties of oysters, which were prepared wonderfully with a few different sauces on the side
Also had the clam chowder- although it's different, (thinner, has carrot) it's great
The salmon was perfect
The mashed potatoes were so good- they had shrimp, lobster and corn in them
I found the owner quite entertaining- he seated us, and came out to see how everything was a few times
We sat at the bar on an early Friday evening and got two dozen oysters
My pal went West Coast, and I stuck to the East
The shucker worked right in front of us and the oysters were great
So was the sharp and thin New England clam chowder
Ok, cool
But the proprietor loudly lashed out at his waitstaff twice during our meal and made an unsolicited and ridiculous comment about international affairs
He came off as an unprofessional blowhard for a joint of this stature
The fish tank centered at the bar doesn't work, especially when the shucker takes a scoop of fish food during his shift and dirties up the tank
We came here for our anniversary dinner and everything was perfect
We were seated in the back dining room where the waitress greeted us with 2 glasses of champagne on the house
Excellent oyster selection and our waitress was very knowledgeable in all the types of oysters
The scallops dish is absolutely divine and so is the chocolate molten cake! The owner, Jay, personally came around to each table and greeted everyone
This place is very cozy and has a very friendly vibe
It's our new favorite restaurant!!
the most amazing and fresh selection of oysters! the steak was only so-so (medium rare is cooked more medium), the fries addictive, and the oysters tasty
I ordered 14 different types of oysters, and there was about 20 more types that I didn't have the opportunity to taste
i'm definitely going back for more

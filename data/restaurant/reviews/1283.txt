And oh oh oh
I almost forgot !!! Their Key Lime pie is a gift from the gods
Ok so this place is owner operated and it shows
Care is put into every detail
Bar BQ is a must for any BBQ fan
The brisket is outstanding and the pulled pork is biblically good
Plus they have a over 30 types of whiskey and hot sauces to choose from
I very quickly became a fan after the great service and outstanding food
Try them out
I've been a fan of Bar BQ since the days its owner was selling sandwiches at street fairs and I followed him to his restaurant
The pulled pork sandwich is the best ever
so tender, so rich, so moist
and the sauce! My favorite is the NC style vinegar based sauce, but they're all good
And the brisket is great too, but my heart follows the oink
The place couldn't be friendlier and its where I take all my out-of-town Southern friends when they want a taste of home
They've never been disappointed
Highly recommended for the BBQ expert and novice alike
Good eats, friendly service, family friendly and great for a group, too
My son and I are new to this neighborhood and are so happy to have found BAR BQ! It's a great combo of family restaurant and bar
I had some drinks and a great pulled pork sandwich with incredible sauces and my son had chicken and chocolate cake
Prices are fair and the staff was friendly
With the understanding that excellent BBQ is difficult to find in Manhattan let alone Bklyn so I didnt go in with very high expectations
I got the combo platter which who's price would have been ok, had the food qulaity been better
For my 24$ i got a generous portion of some grey mushy brisket, a couple of dry ribs, and a hotlink so bad I cant describe it
Ambiance wasnt great but its bbq, its supposed to be about the food not stuff on the wall
service was ok, but im sure they dont get much return business due to food quality  paper plates and plastic utensils
the only way i can justify this is if its a) cheap b) a picnic or c) delicious
unfortunately it was d) none of the above  In all fairness they make a pretty good cole slaw, but hell so can I
I had the opportunity to sample the best pulled pork BBQ ever
Great smoked flavor, tender, and seasoned just right
The home made BBQ sauce is to die for
Keep up the great work, Frank!!!!!
This cute little neighborhood joint has a great bar with a ton of bourbons and surprisingly good barbeque
I like the pulled pork sandwich, chicken wings, and ribs
Their cole slaw is my all time favorite
The bartenders are all fun and I always have a great time
Disappointed is the understatement of the year considering the reviews
In prep for a SuperBowl party I did a taste test 7 meat sampler and was stunned by how little taste there was
This was WAY off the mark in terms of BBQ
The sausage might as well of been Jimmy Dean or from a Hot Dog stand, the Brisket was on the dry side, the Pulled Pork was decent at best, and the Ribs were a giant boiled chunk of fat
Both BBQ sauces were on the bland side and if the best thing in this sampler was the MacNCheese or White Bread
that's a problem
Needless to say this will not served at my Superbowl party
Its a shame b/c the staff was friendly and the place was very clean, I just cannot endorse its food with a good conscience to BBQ lovers
Taste at your own risk
if you like meat like i like meat
piles of perfectly smoked animal with a slice of classic white bread to sop up the goodness
this place is heaven! and if you love bourbon and baked beans and cheap beer and homemade coleslaw and tangy barbecue sauce and ribs and key lime pie
it's in our neighborhood and it's neither stuffy nor dirty, not uptight, too expensive or lazy in it's preparation of amazing barbecue
highly recommended!!!!! orgasmic pulled pork! seriously
wear comfortable pants
I was very surprised, pleasantly I should add, by the food at Bar BQ
I had the pulled pork sandwich and the bbq beans and both were very good
The pork had just the right amount of smoke with little fat
The sauce was the epitome of BBQ - sweet and a little hot
I will definitely go back
I have to agree with supergirltrish about the cornbread; I would have liked some
Sure, the place looks like a dive outside, and is just a simple bar on the inside, but who cares about ambiance with food this good? If you want to relax in a never crowded bar, drink excellent beer (super-clean taps! and ice cold), and eat the most tender ribs in your life, then this place is for you! The ribs are delicious; they didn't even need the homemade sauce that sits on the tables (it's great too, a little sweet, a little tangy)
Don't the people who complained about the paper plastic realize the kitchen is the size of a closet?! They probably can't fit a dishwasher in there
BBQ isn't supposed to be fancy! It is supposed to be like a picnic
If you want linens and china, go to afternoon tea at the Plaza Hotel
If you want good, down home food, give BarBQ a try
We're always looking for allergy friendly restaurants where we can take our highly food-allergic daughter - Bar BQ is a find!  Not only can my husband and I get great food, but the staff is lovely, caring and attentive to our daughter's dietary needs
The chicken is treated with a rub and then smoked, no butter, oil, or anything else touches it
This is a place for foodies who are purists
We've been 5 times and love the sides, the pulled pork and chicken
the new smoked veggies are killer, especially the cauliflower and corn
The bourbon list is probably unmatched in park slope, hell, maybe all of nyc for that matter - at least 25 are available and priced fairly, and the giant glasses of carlsberg lager are also incredible
it's simply a great place and probably the best food south of 14th street anywhere in park slope!
This cute neighborhood bar has amazing food! Friendly, homey ambiance coupled with perfect smoked meats and a simple complement of sides makes this place a real winner
Every item on the menu tasted like it had been lovingly perfected- from the pulled pork sandwich on white roll to the smokey baked beans, buttery mac-n-cheese, and slightly spicey coleslaw
And for about 10 bucks a person you can afford to pig out
A good place to take a date if you want to see them lick their fingers
Found out about this place in citysearch and the reviews seemed very positive
It felt and smelt right for a BBQ place and the variety of burbons was quite welcome
The food itself was a crediable try for a new place (it opened in March 2005)
The ribs tasted like they were boiled rather than smoked and did not have that dry patina that smoking would provide
The pulled pork was good as well as the side dishes
The brisket was dry and needed more smoke flavor
I did not see any smoke ring on the ribs or brisket
We have tried Blue Smoke in Manhattan and their ribs were definitely smoky
Still, we will try this place again since it is close by
I grew up in the south, so my BBQ standards are high but this place has some of the better NYC BBQ
The pulled pork had the right amount of smokiness worked well with any kind of sauce
Ribs were great
The white bread is truly southern tasted great with the BBQ
They have some of the only sweet tea you'll find in NYC (but it's lemon flavored)
Side dishes were a bit pitiful
The mac 'n cheese was OK, but the potato salad was like nothing I ever saw in the south
Meat portions are huge
Desserts are actually homemade
The chocolate cake was a tad dry but the key lime pie was delicious
The restaurant itself is very basic minimal on decor
Desolate neighborhood, but great jukebox and very friendly waiter/bartender
Even the cook came out and asked us about our food
I will return
The first thing we remarked on when we walked in was the row of bourbons at the bar
very impressive! The pulled pork and the sides
outstanding
There are only 4 sides so if you go with a friend you don't miss any

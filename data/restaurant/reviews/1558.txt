love black hound cookies but the service really puts you in a mood - a bad one!
After walking past this bakery and salivating every time i finally stopped in
The free samples were wonderful and choosing from the beautiful mini cakes was quite a task
The mini cakes r easily shared for a delicious and inexpensive dessert
I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive
I completely disagree with the previous post
this place is amazing
The staff is always very friendly( I don't work there) and their Busy Bee cake is to DIE FOR! - a chocolate/marzipan cake-soooo good
Their chocolates are great too
-r
I work in the neighborhood and eat there practically everyday
The food is great, but it's simply over priced
A little pre-made wrap is 8 bucks! AND I have to go back to work and eat it at my desk because there's usually no place to sit in the restaurant
Which, however may be a good thing because stepping in there for 5 minutes will have you smelling like the place for hours!
A great place to stop for a bite on the go or to sit on your own without feeling awkward
With some bar style seats in the window and a few benchs, this is a great place to grab a healthy bite
Everything at the counter is made there and the selection is great
They have everything from fruit to baked goods to smoothies and coffees to salmon and chicken
Yummy
The atmosphere is a bit crazed, as most poeple stop there on their way to someone else, but for the conveniece, the food is great
With a zillion competitors in the city, there is no reason to go to this store
The staff was not just rude on my visit, but equipped with customer service skills that were, frankly, bizarre
I was polite, quick to answer and ready with my money
In return, I got nasty service from three very uncouth girls working the counter
Strange stuff
All I wanted was some coffee
Serious! Never going back
The staff is too cool for school
They are inattentive, unhelpful, rude and smug
When you need help their having conversations amongst themselves
They did not acknowledge my existence and were condecending when I asked questions about the coffee and the grind types
No really a good way to run a business
This is an interesting place
With lot's of tasty organic treats, they also carry more traditional fare
Large variety of delicious and different coffees, definetely try the pumpkin spice
it's great
I plan to return and try out more of the interesting foods this place has to offer
Great for a late-night snack after a night of bar-hopping around EV
Better than the other pizza places a few blocks away, not too greasy
Hands down the best slice in New York
Whether you get the meat lovers or the plain or the chicken and tomato--doesn't really matter--it's always absolutely perfect
Been a favorite for the last 5 years
This is without question the best pizza in NYC
Make sure you go to the real Stromboli's on the corner of 8th street and 1st avenue
As was said before, Stromboli's is the perfect place to end your night
They're open well past 4am on the weekends and by that time the staff usually whip up a couple specialty pies to test out on the passing-through drunks
Hands down the best pizza in the East Village
The Scene You have an option to buy cigars right at the entrance when you step into this handsome art deco steakhouse
A few feet away, the bar scene is pure Mickey Spillane drama: martini-swilling, cigar-puffing Wall Street suits, buxom blondes, bored-looking Flatiron hipsters and beer-guzzling working stiffs
The Food Recalling an era of calorie-defying decadence--hard liquor, red meat, cigars and mammoth portions--gluttony is the operative word here
The kitchen celebrates abundance with reckless abandon, pampering patrons with 24-ounce charbroiled T-bones, 28-ounce prime ribs and 20-ounce grilled veal chops
Retro appetizers include shrimp cocktail, clams casino and steak tartare
The trip down memory lane concludes with nostalgia-inspired desserts like an Oreo ice cream sandwich, "D Train" egg cream or a hot fudge sundae
Food is average at best, atmosphere and crowd are cheesy, imagine blasting top 40 hits and BT crowd, the service is the worst!!!! the waitstaff was rude and rushed us through all our food, and took away our food despite telling them we weren't done!!! i would not go again, nor recommend it to anyone
Because it's located in a prime location, I have been here a few times
Service was spotty and they never get the steaks right
Portions are huge and prices are high, as found at most steakhouses, making this place just average
A few suggestions: Have your steak blackened; indulge in the warm bread pudding and the white chocolate martini, and regardless of how far you live, walk home!
10:30 seating for a 9:30 reservation! The food was good but nothing spectacular, the service was average at best
This is a restaurant on its way down not up
Always love this place
The filet mignon is wonderful
The service is great, always a fun atmosphere
The only negative is that everything is served a la carte, so it can add up pretty quickly
But all in all it's a delicious meal, worth the price
I LOVE their lobster bisque
I would go back over and over for it
The service on the other hand is lacking
Each time we go we have reservations and it still takes at least 20 minutes to be seated
Service is okay
nothing outstanding
But again GREAT LOBSTER BISQUE
My best friend is a steak fanatic
Every year I take her to this restaurant for her birthday
Each year we go back, it gets worse and worse
This time maybe the last time
The food was ok
My filet mignon which I requested to be medium came charred on the outside and rare on the inside
The sweet potatos were huge but absolutely lacking in flavor
The asparagus was overdone and what happened to the serving size? There were five pieces for the small
I'm sorry but I don' t think I should pay 7 dollars for 5 pieces
To top it all, when I left an 18% gratuity since I wasn't at all impressed, I find that they helped themselves to a 20% gratuity!!! There was nothing on the menu that said you HAVE to leave 20%
I find that just rude and distasteful
Ate here this past Saturday night
The food was ok, but nothing stellar
I had the ribeye, which was decent but I've had much better, even at restaurants that weren't steakhouses
The creamed spinach was good, but the mashed potatoes were too overdone with garlic
It was a very loud atmoshere and seating was cramped
The place was overflowing with the Bridge and Tunnel crowd - kinda felt like I had left New York City when I entered this place
Though not a terrible dining experience by any means, I dont't think I'd go back
You figure reservations would get you a table quicker, well not at this place
it seems like whoever can get a hold of the matr'd or scream the loudest gets the table first, thats if you can find that matr'd
If this restaurant cant accomodate all their guests maybe they should just suggest them to eat elsewhere
I had reservations for 9:30pm and after waiting more that 50 mins and bunch of lies that you're next
I just left
thank god theres plenty of restaurants willing to accommodate then this place
I was looking forward to a good steak after a hard week
What I got was a hard steak with good service
The wait staff were eager to serve the clientel but the steak didn't have the gumption to please a seasoned steak lover
OK if it was from a backyard BBQ, but to offer the steak as a prime cuisine, left a lot to offer

I don't think I've ever had this much fun at a place to eat here in the city
And spent so little money doing so
From the moment I walked in, the feeling was one of good vibes, good beer, and even better food
As an African American, I was very happy to see many young women of color who were pleanast from the moment I encountered them
The staff is very genterfied, which is excalty what a place like that needs to reflext the crowd that eats their
I know Bar B Q, and I know ribbs, and the I must say I was pretty impress
The shrimp were great
But the wings were by far the best wings I have ever had in my life
The fried rice is on the money
The mac n cheese will mealt away all the cares in the world
My boyfriend and I had the wings, shrimps, sweethear deal for two ribs that came with 4 sides, and we had a total of 6 beers to drink
The total of our bill was $75
00 with tip include
Eat up and have fun when you get to this spot
This place is amazing! All it took was 1 bite and I was completly in love with Dinosaur
Any selection from the menu is highly recommended (so amzingly soft; steaming with rich and just right bbq flavor)
If you love beer, there are over 23 selections on tap, bottle and buckets, if not, not to worry there are also mixed cocktails available virgin drinks
If you don't get there before 4pm, reservations are highly recommended! Dress sporty comfortable for the seating area is very woody (some are church pews)
Parking might be a challange
Once parking is found proceed on entering BBQ Heaven; The smell of pure flavor out most welcoming service will walk you to your table to begin your journey of excellent BBQ experience
Happy BBQ to our Mandarin Oriental ITT group outing for Chuan!
I was there with a group of 8 on a very rainy Friday on June 2nd
we started with Blue Moon beer at the bar and was seated prompty at our reservation time of 7:30
We got great service all throughout the night, but I think it was largely due to their less than expected capacity due to the torrential rain that night
Some friends are regulars, and they say that they've had good and not so good service, but they keep coming back! The fried green tomatoes, bbq wings, ribs and roast chicken were amazing!!! I've ahd better brisket
Overall I will be coming back
Me and my friends went here after hearing incredible things and let me tell you, all the reviews were spot on! Food was great, service was incredible and I love the beer selection
Ate first in the dining room then went over to the bar for drinks and made friends with a man and his wife
If at all possible get Julie to help you at the bar, she's awesome
And for the long of god, tip your batender
Probably a good idea to make reservation if you're not already there at 4
Cheers
I am urging everyone to make reservations and to hold your breath
The two times I was there with reservations I waited half an hour to be seated
Another thing is to remember the waiters face in order to track him or her down for anything
Overall, the food is very good I recommend the buffalo wings, mac cheese, syracuse style salt potatoes, churrasco chicken steak and west texas rib eye (I think thats a handful)
The food,service, and prices were great
The best advise I can give you is ,go on a Sunday afternoon,you will be seated right away
Ok, ok I know this isn't exactly soul food, but it's close enough after a long day at work, this was the most PERFECT place to chill out - the food, the beer, the whole experience, WOW
I pigged out on bar-b-que chicken (so tender seasoned just right)
The bucket of beer was an excellent value
Couldn't resist having dessert and was not at all disappointed
I may live in the area, but this place is TOTALLY worth the trip uptown
Do NOT miss it whatever you do
The ambience is chill, our server was friendly and gave good suggestions and the whole meal was less than $60 for ALL that food beer
You simply cannot beat it
I'll be a faithful Dinosaur-junkie forever!   PS Don't forget to bring a sharpie so you can write your own tag on the bathroom walls - seriously, it's a trip!
Portions are small and menu is not inexpensive
On recent meal, pulled pork and beef brisket were rubbery-like supermarket meat
Ribs were good - but not great- and again small portions and rather high prices
I ordered an Old Grand Dad and though I am not 100% sure, I think they substitued cheap booze instead
Service and ambience are good
It is scary parking around there at night
went there on a Sunday with my girlfriend and were seated right away
I got the Tres Hombre which had the pulled prok, ribs and brisket (along with 2 sides) and it was awesome, plus it was only $15
Get the Salt potatoes too
Anyone who says they don't like this barbeque either came on a strangely off night or doesn't know ribs
The atmosphere is great---families from the neighborhood, 30 somethings, bikers and just plain barbeque lovers
The beer list is fantastic and the bartenders make a very mean marguerita
Don't miss the chicken wings or fried green tomatoes
This place is very reasonably priced---just make a reservation or eat in the bar
We'd invited friends to join us for a birthday dinner
A reservation was definitely a good idea
We were seated promptly upon arrival
Our waiter Jeremy was prompt courtesy, answering any questions
There were an extensive numbers of beers on tap, albeit most drank the Root Beer
The food arrived quickly

If youre used to eating a full rack of ribs from the other BBQ restaurants, be careful here, think smaller, you wont be disappointed
Great tasting Brisket Pulled Pork
Portions are a good size
Key Lime Sweet Potato pies for desert with 4 forks were excellent
A new delight for the Northern Manhattan neighborhood :)
I found the Place thanks to knowing where the Cotton Club is
I had a great time
The Food was good, almost great, my brisket was a little dry, but very tender and smoky
The service was fun
We were having a good time with our server, who seemed to have fun with us
She was ontop of everything we needed, and seemed to be having fun in her section with other tables
It was cool to see some live blues that just blended into the background
Sides were good, deviled eggs were great, and the BBQ wings were excellent
Can't wait to go back
Definitely the best barbecue in the city
Great food, reasonably priced, generous portions, fun atmosphere, great beer selection
I'm glad it's so far out of the way or I'd wind up there every night
Being orignally from upstate I was already a fan of the Dinosaur, I thought the NYC location may not be as good
I was wrong
Still excellent food, best in the city
Great prices and a great atmosphere
The best part is the location, while far removed it keeps the pretentious New Yorkers away
god forbid they have to drive to Harlem!
I got the Big House Special, which consisted of 3 ribs (Nice meaty lean - tender too) and 1/2 BBQ chicken
Now, nobody here has talked about the chicken yet
It was the best BBQ chicken I've ever had in a NY BBQ restaurant
The usual danger is the chicken drying out
This didn't happen
It was moist, held the hickory flavor well, and wasn't doused in sauce - it was just right
The steamed greens BBQ beans were very good
I also found the prices to be quite reasonable
Next time I go, I want to try a sandwich platter

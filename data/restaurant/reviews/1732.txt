Unlike much northern Italian food found in New York, this is northern Italian food without the quotation marks
I'll return many more times
The food is excellet
No wonder, in fact the cook comes from the best italian tradition
If you want to try really Italian food, this is the place
The prices are high but warranted
The service is nice and friendly
Try the gnocchi with venison ragout, or if you go in the season, the pasta with white truffle
This is how we eat in Italy when we eat really well
after moving into the gramercy park neighborhood, novita was one of the first nice dinners out i had, and let me tell you it made quite a lasting impression
i keep going back and whenever i have guests in from out of town i take them there too
sure the decor is basic but it's sleek
really the only downside i've found is because of extreme popularity it can be a bit of a squeeze
i really like this restaurant
Not pretentious or stuffy and the service was really good
I had the lobster pasta and it was EXCELLENT
MMMMM Perfectly cooked and seasoned
I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends
True Northern cuisine
i dont often sit down and write down reviews about places where i dine but i had to write something about novita, and i would like to write something fresh as the name of this cozzy, warm, and romantic place means
i joined my friends for dinner and the first impression i got from the poorly decorated place was something i soon forgot
I was very impressed with the knowledge the staff had about the food served and i just loved the long list of specials ( more than 15) giving even the most regurals a wide selection of dishes
the service was excellent and all i have to say is : Novita you really impressed, and u got another regular
We had just about one of the worse experiences in the city at Novita
The food was bland and flavorless
The menu was misleading providing hopes of one thing when something else arrives at your table
The service was non-existant, the manager spent all of his time at the bar
The question is how this restaurant can be rated so high, despite its poor performance?
Friendly staff with attention to detail
A top quality restaurant for frequent travelers to be served a wonderful Italian dinner
This excellent neighborhood standout can be counted on to deliver consistently outstanding Northern Italian
Some of the very best pasta and seadfood in the city
Pro service and a solid well priced all Ital wine list
With all the choices of restaurants in the Union Sq
/Gramercy area, I'd think that this place would try a bit harder, but they don't
The food is not quite right: chunks of Parmegiano are little too thick on top of the carpaccio, the pasta is just a second or two past al dente, the cappucino is bitter
The service is surly, indifferent and cold; they practically throw plates at you and then grab them away just as quickly
The beige decor and the white starched linens remind of a fance nursing home
If these people want to charge the high prices, they should provide much higher quality food and service
Small space but well located on 22 St
, not far off Park Ave
Tidy but unremarkable decoration - very white and plain
Small bar at the entrance and a lower dining area - you get a knee level view of the street outside
Unhelpful staff made the dining experience unpleasant
Most of my party of 4 found their food to be bland
I can hardly recall what I ate - always a bad sign
There are many better choices on the same street
Great food, everything from fresh fish to your typical stand-by italian dishes
I had the best gnocchi of my life at this restaurant
Though pricey, this is the perfect place for a special meal with friends or family
The service was impeccable (though I was there on a rather slow winter sunday evening), and the atmosphere is warm and simple
AND they deliver!!!
If you're craving a good meal, yet do not want to go to a high-maintenance, chi-chi restaurant, Novita is the place to go
The ambience will not impress you, but the food surely will
The Insalata di Calamar and the Swordfish were delicious
However, the lamb left MUCH to be desired-it was rare and had a VERY gamey taste
Skip the lamb and you will be very impressed by Novita
Novita offers quality Italian fare, a pleasant staff and decent surroundings in the Gramercy neighborhood without the hyper-bustle of the Bridge Tunnel traps of Park Ave
South or the pretense of some of the areas high $$ establishments
It is a true neighborhood restaurant where you are recognized and acknowledged by the proprietor and staff after a few visits
There is always pasta with truffles available off menu and a long list of specials
One observation is the chef could make better use of the farmer's market in Union Square, as the salad tomatoes are less than stellar
Otherwise, the food is quite good
Neither the staff nor the food complimented one another
The asparagus salad was on the bland side, the free range chicken was fatty, and the truffle ravioli special was boring
Although the food was fresh, unfortunately so was the staff
this restaurant is a good value, door people have a lot to learn about providing good and on time service, the rest of the staff are great
Wonderful, Italian dining experience,
pleasant professional service, incredible raviolis and pastas served in a warm and elegant atmosphere
Novita, is perfect for the well traveled, food savy, Italofile who's looking for that special somthing that eludes most NYC, Italians
The wait staff and hostess were wonderful, and the simple yet comfortable atmosphere is a plus
However, while the salads were all right, they were prepared in advance
As for the main course: the fish was hit or miss
the chicken was plentiful and somewhat tasty
Always fresh, always delivered quickly, always delicious
Nothing ordered from Frank's has ever disappointed
From steaming hot pizza to generous pasta dishes to delicious salads and wonderful clams
I love this little whole in the wall
I can get a slice for $1
50-$2 or a whole large pie for $8
Can't go wrong
Sauce is amazing
olive oil crushed tomatoes, so light and crispy
Also in the back they have a wonderful italian sit down restuarant
Great food there too
MMM Baked Ravioli!
I've been a regular customer for two years now and I've never been disappointed
I clean my plate everytime I eat at this place
During the 2003 blackout, we were lucky to be able to order a few of the last pies they were serving! Everything is good there: pizza, chicken parm heroes, pasta dishes, chicken dishes, calamari, sangria and even the coffee! My most favorite local italian eatery
I have been there many times and the food is always consistent, over and over again
The service is ok, and even if the place is crampy i like to eat a good italian meal here
It's really worthed the money you spend
It's been a few years snce I order in delivery from Cosmos - I couldn't remember why I stopped so I figured it was time to try again
what a mistake
After waiting over an hour for an order consisting of a sandwich and a potato, they call to say they don't have the potato
I substitute somethng else
Although they are only 3 blocks frm me, its another 35 minutes until my order arrives
They get the sandwich wrong
I calla them up - thety tell me no way they are coming out again with the right sandwich and hang up
I call back and tell them i want my money back - they did not deliver what i ordered - they hang up

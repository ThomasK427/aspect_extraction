Go! you'll see what I mean
This was my first time dining at Fleur de Sel and I wasn't sure what to expect
I heard many good things but I'm always a little hesitant before trying somewhere new
I am so glad my friends recommended this restaurant to me
The food was the best I've tried in a long time and the service was really attentive
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends
One of the most under-rated restaurant in the city
The cuisine and service is to match with any top notch restaurant
We had the tasting menu and wine pairing
Great culinary journey
The Mackeral tartar, scallops with artichoke chips are great flavors
And the Veal
oh my god
Can't wait to have another date there
I don't know what this guy is talking about below me, but the staff are wonderful and courteous
This restaurant will blow you away
10/29/04 - An enjoyable evening in this cozy Grammercy Park eatery
The amble sweetbreads and goat cheese/caviar ravioli appetizers were memorable, but the highlight of our dinner was the scallops in a cream reduction entree - truly heavenly
Good wines under $100 are included in the predominantly French list, but take some ferreting out to find
We enjoyed a particularly tasty 97 Cote d' Beaune
Great spot!
it is the my best meal since the original bouley, well balance and nicely presented
the service was gracious
the room was cozy and my wife and I had a fantastic time
I can only recommend you to go have the tasting menu a bargain in ny
Yes, I did have an amazing lunch experience @ Fleur de Sel
The Tasting menu is a great value (along w/wine pairing) but splurge and enjoy the chef's imagination
Service was attentive but not obtrusive
I had dinner at Fleur de Sel last week with my boyfriend and it was one of the best food experiences I had since I was in France last year, the food was extraordinary, easily compared to any of the top restaurants I've dined before, the seared Foie Gras was delighful, the Scallops were fantastic and if that wasn't enough the 3 course dessert tasting made the whole experience uncomparable
Not only the food was superb but with the help of the sommelier it was paired with incredible wine , and of course the staff was friendly and helpful which made the whole experience worthwhile and worth enjoying more often, we'll be going back soon, thank you!
this has got to be one of my favorite places to eat now
The flavors and the artistic talent of this chef is amazing
I took my wife their for the first time a couple of weeks ago
We were amazed
And their wine list is outstanding
so many choices
We hope everyone gets a chance to go try this place
be ready to eat good food
best dining experience yet in new york
amazing food, wine selection and service
you will not be disappointed!
The only thing more delicious than the incredible goat cheese ravioli pillows and perfectly cooked, sensuously textured scallops served up at Fleur de Sel was the beautiful date I shared them with
And when one is already drunk on romance to begin with, the Monday night wine promotion is a great extra touch
Didn't sample dessert -- but the deli across the street has ample treats that can be picked up for a private sweet finish
I had one of the best dining experienced in New York at Fleur de Sel
what an underated restaurant!!!! Their food is fantastic
The best Foie Gras I've ever had in my life
And the pork chop dish with the sweet potato puree
wow
Seriously folks
please try this place
Just call ahead of time cuz it gets pack
and there were even celebrities there that I will not name
simply Amazing!!
Very classy
This is the fourth time i've been there
And the dishes keeps getting better
I can't say enough about them
They really know what they are doing here
My hats off to the chef and his staff
If their Restaurant Week menu was a hint of what they can do on a regular basis, then I can't wait to go back and have dinner
Service was utterly charming with the attention paid to the smallest detail
Warm slices of bread
Cutletry brought to you
Each dish is perfectly composed to compliment and balance flavors
I plan to be back in a heartbeat
I love to eat fine cuisine
And this is at the top of the pyramid
If people are not noticing, they should be
The chef is a culinary genius
He is the next big thing
Took my girlfriend for her birthday
We both had the tasting menu (4 courses and 2 deserts)
We had the salmon tartare and cavier, which we loved
Next, she had the asparagus soup, which she loved
I had the goatcheese ravioli, which was very good
Next, she had the halibut, and I had the scallop dish
Both were amazing
Finally, she had the veal and I had the venison dish
I preferred her dish, but next time
As for the desert, the bannana mousse was very good, as well as the chocolate desert
Overall, amazing food and service
The total bill with wine came out to about $200, which is cheaper than going to other upscale restaurants with same quality of food
We have been to many good restaurants, and we rank Fleur de sel among the top
A perfect dinner experience
We were seated exactly at our reservation time
Everyone at the table agreed that the food was amazing - from the sourdough bread to the deserts
I had white assparagus soup and the lamb
It was the best meal I have eaten quite a while
Service was exceptional, absolutly nothing overlooked
The chef also accomodated my dates allergies, which ocasionally, is hard to find
It was a little spendy, but you get what yo pay for
With apps, entree coffe and desert, plan on $60 a person
We held a lunch bridal shower for my cousin
We just wanted to thank the restaurant for giving us such a wonderful day, and making the room and giving us such beautiful food and service
Thank you for making my cousin so happy!!
We took my mother to fleur de Sel for Mother's day
Our whole family was there
What a wonderful experience
The warmth that their staff gave my mom was more than I could ask for

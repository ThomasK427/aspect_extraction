They're so high-minded about keeping things authentic that they refuse to accommodate ANYONE who dares challenge their art
The veggie plate and dessert are left off the menu, as if their presence is offensive
The vegan in our group asked if the garnish of goat cheese could be left off the top of her stuffed peppers, and the waiter said, quite rudely, No! It's part of the dish and they won't alter it
This is New York City, and that's unheard-of
(And since when is goat cheese part of authentic Mexican cuisine?)
Other than the guacamole, which is absolutely delicious, and the heavenly frozen margaritas, the food was terrible--tuna enchiladas that tasted like they were made with canned StarKist; overly-fried tacquitos that reminded me of the little snack you get before your mall chinese food; a steak filet that was brutalized with manchego cheese (and cold) and nearly tasteless; and a chewy, fat-infused slab of greying pork chop
This was truly the worst sit-down mexican food I've had in this city
BOO! BOOOOO!!
One of the few GREAT mexican food restaurants in NYC
The fresh guac is to die for - the specials are always delish - and the margaritas are some of the best I've ever had
Never disappoints
From the food to the service (can't forget the Margaritas) Rosa Mexicano is a dream come true
If you're craving Mexican food this is definitely the place to go
The Guacamole is made fresh at your table, it's the best I've tasted, Mmmmm!
I can't eat guacamole anywhere else - the guacamole that Rosa makes tableside is so delicious that everyone else's tastes like a pale comparison
And I love the little corn tortillas to wrap it in - less fattening than chips!  The other food is consistently fabulous, too
I recently had a shrimp special served on rice with wild mushrooms that was outstanding
Went for the $20
02 prix fixe lunch and left stuffed
I was full after the guacamole (made table side)
The seafood stuffed tamale was incredible, and then they brought the dessert, which of course I ate despite full
In Short Benihana started out as a tiny four-table restaurant in New York City's theater district before becoming an international chain
Diners sit around large tables where chefs ostentatiously chop, slice, stir-fry and grill
Entree options are simple--shrimp, chicken, steak and scallops--and preparation is uniform
Every entree comes with a similar stock of sides: green tea, rice, onion soup, shrimp appetizer, iceberg lettuce drizzled with dressing and sauteed vegetables
Do not go in with high expectations
The show consists of smoke coming out of onions to look like a volcano
Most places at least have a flame as well
No knife show, NOT ENTERTAINING
The worst part was the food
The salad and soup were good however, the main course of steak and chicken was of very poor quality
The steak was dry and chewy, and most fast food restaurants have better chicken
Garlic butter is added to the fried rice, which makes it taste horrible
It was quite amusing to watch the Hibachi chef make volcanoes out of onions and toss veggie slices into his hat
That's it
Spicy tuna sushi was very good, but the tempura sushi was rubbery
The server was nice to let 4 people share 2 main dishes
As we were small eaters, the servings were perfect
But the teriyaki chicken and steak were tasteless, and so was the vegetable fried rice
Bring perfume, or else, you'll leave smelling like a hibachi stove
If you're going as a group7 people, be prepared to share the table with strangers
Anticipation was the initial feeling I experienced as I walked into the restaurant
I was excited that my lunch would be cooked and served right before my eyes
The salad and miso soup served at the beginning of the meal was excellent
The actual dish I ordered was quite tasty but nothing out of the ordinary
The service was terrible
What the restaurant needs is to have a waitress that can both speak and understand english thoroughly
She insisted that I ordered dishes I didn't even order
I asked her about several items on the menu simply out of curiosity
She ended up having the chef cook them for me
She assumed that since I pointed at the items as I inquired abou them, I automatically meant that I wanted to order them
She agrivated me and spoiled my lunch
In Short Burnished brass and stained wood complement roughly mortared brick and the occasional plant
Amid ubiquitous earth tones, corporate types and small parties (celebrating or simply living large) occupy deep booths done up in fine upholstery and lit from above by pin spotlights
Burgers, prime rib and steaks are the specialties of the house, but the menu also includes salmon, salads, pork chops and roasted chicken
Steak is my favorite
And this place is my favorite place start from NOW
I have ate steak around New York as Ruth Christ, Pastis, Haru, Outback and any place
But their steak is unbeliavable, is soo tasty
Added with Live Jazz, romantic place, it is supposed to be the best in new york
Great, the waiter have great service
Don't forget, don't leave without try the spinach dip for appetizer
Spinach dip appetizer, and Rib Eye steak
Just it, perfect combination and you will have to pay for around $ 50 / person
Not bad for high class steak house huh ?
This place continues to impress me
I have been dining at Houstons since they opened 8 tears ago
It just keeps getting better
The Thai salad and Crabcakes are to die for
I day dream about the food
Everyone is so nice you almost forget your in New York
I love this place
Ever since '00
My Fiance and I are good restaurants hunters and Houston's remains to be our Number 1
Food is great
(recommend BBQ Rips)
Starting at 8pm they have a great Live Jazz Band
Great service from the staff
Houston's is one of my favorite casual/date restaurant to go to
Especially this one
There's usually a little jazz music on busy nights, which helps set the mood
The food is delicious! The spinach dip is a MUST have! My favorite entree is the Fork and Knife Ribs
Great for a group but they don't take reservations! Just head upstairs to BN while you wait
If they tell you the wait is 40 minutes, they're usually very prompt about it being 40 minutes and not a minute longer
I went to Houston's with a group of friends and had a wonderful time
We were seated promptly in a large, cushy booth, and ordered burgers and salads
I had a bite of my boyfriend's burger, which was juicy and delicious
My seared tuna salad was delectable
My only complaint would be that our server refused to serve our friend who did not have her I
D
on her
Seems a little extreme, but other than that, we had a great first experience! I will definitely be going back
Monday night around 730pm, met with friends in the bar area, service was friendly
Moved to a table after a few drinks, don't know if my friend made reservations or not
Waiter was nice, food was good
I had baked chicken, buddy had ribs, the girls had the chicken salad minced and so did one other guy
guess it was good
Price was reasonable, nice atmosphere, not too fancy, but nice enough for after work or even a date too
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair

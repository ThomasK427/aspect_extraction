I prefer mine on the rocks, no salt
They are in a word SMOOOOOOOOOOOTH!!!!!!!!!
Great food, huge portions and friendly service
Who could ask for anything more?
the fajitas are great, and on mondays you can get them for half price! What a deal! My wife and I always enjoy Cilantro
Staff is always nice
The pork chops and quesadillas are excellent
Margaritas are slightly overrated, so I drink beer
No worries!
I used to live in the 90's and loved the Cilantro on 2nd Ave
Now I live in the 60's and love the Cilantro on 1st Ave
Great chips, great margaritas and great food
started off with the salsa and the fancy chips, and a very flavorful, very strong margarita
they are definitely not overrated, and anybody who enjoys margaritas owes it to themselves to try one here
then my girlfriend and I had the porterhouse steak with bourbon sauce, and lobster mashed potatoes
yes, it was every bit as good as it sounds
for dessert, the large brownie is to die for, and is served with whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate and strawberry sauce
we had the back room to ourselves, as it was late, and it was beautiful
the service was superb as everybody from the owner to the bus boy asked us how it was and wished us a great night as we left
definitely a nust if you are visiting the city
The brunch menu has a good selection, with a nice variety
The food was excellent( especially the habanero wings appetizer) and the ingredients were of exceptional quality
Tex Mex specialists , lovely music, great price, so much fun to see enjoy, specially the hot waiting staff
Aside for the delectable drinks, the tex mex cuisine was quite tasty
Opting for salmon, I enjoyed the southern border flavor and the charming latino waitress who was ever so convivial
The place was alive and fun for a group excursion of imbibing and eating
Not quite what I'd call authentic mexican, but certainly great tex-mex
If you want great mexican food you have to come here
The food is amazing and the portions are huge
It is also a great place for drinks with friends
The margharitas are amazing
I was in the area looking at apartments and decided to get grab a bite to eat
Looked at the menu and saw the prices to be very reasonable for brunch
The steak and eggs were delicious
My girlfriend and I found the service to be very courteous and friendly
Must go and try dinner there one day
I'm glad she convinced me to try this restaraunt!
My roommates and I refer to this place as our dining room
We live one block away and eat here once a week
I have yet to be disappointed
The food is excellent and inexpensive
Waitstaff is very friendly
I highly recommend this place
Well worth it! The staff is great, the atmosphere is great, the food is awesome AND inexpensive, and most of all the margaritta's are off the hook! A place you'll be proud to recommend!
I live one block away from one of the best southwestern joints in the Upper East Side
Service is close to excellent and there is a big dining area to enjoy your meal
My boyfriend and I went here for his 27th birthday
I was looking for a romantic restaurant with great food, and I definitely did find one! We had a reservation and were seated right away
The ambience was romantic with dim lighting
Our waitress was great
very attentive and happy to answer any questions
My boyfriend loves steak and ordered their signature steak (I forget the name of it!)
He said it was the best steak he's ever eaten! I tried it too , and it was fabulous! I ordered a cavatelli dish with a sambuca sauce
very different, but also very good
We are looking forward to taking our couples friends out to York Grill when they come to visit!
Have read reviews over time and finally had an opportunity to visit
Brought a friend from out of town and we were very pleasently surprised
Even though the place was very dark (difficult to read menus!), the decor was lovely and we felt quite comfortable at a table by the front winow
The menu of upscale American fare is somewhat intimidating as there are almost too many choices, but our wonderful waiter Eric came to the rescue suggesting and describing specials as if he had just polished off dinner himself
Request to sit in his section, as he is quite simply one of the most gracious and accomplished waiters you're likely to have
Everything, from the Filet Minion to the Monkfish was sublime
Suggestions for wine were spot on and our evening was quite memorable
Living in the neighbourhood, every time I come here, I come for the marinated skirt steak
It is beyond delicious and could give those major steakhouses a run for their money
I particularly enjoy the sauteed onions with the steak and they are a great complement to the meat, along with the mashed potatoes
This is definitely the place I come to when I desire comfort food
The only issue I might have with it is the lighting, which is a little dim for my tastes
I haven't had brunch here yet so I can't really give it a rating but unfortunately, there wasn't a Not Applicable rating
I just took my husband to the York Grill for his birthday dinner and the food was just fabulous! I had the skirt steak, which was as soft as butter and so flavorful because it had this sweet glaze all over it
My husband had the filet mignon which was sitting on pounds of sauteed spinach
These entrees were extremely hearty and they weren't stingy with the appetizers either
You really get your money's worth at this restaurant
The overall restaurant decor is pleasant and even the hidden location makes going here a treat!
I absolutely love everything about the York Grill
I especially love the delicious, fresh Halibut and other fish dishes and specials - and of course the crab cakes
The owner always makes us feel so special which is one of the reasons we eat York Grill several times a week
Even though we are out of the immediate area, we think it is worth the trip! The staff of York Grill has been so helpful in planning celebrations for us and we are hosting my daughter's birthday party there next month
Excellent food and atmosphere
Nice lounge area
Excellent for Sunday Brunch and dinners!
The York Grill was a discovery my boyfriend and myself made while furniture shopping for our new place
The sales assistant highly recommnended the York Grill for Sunday Brunch
We were delighted to find such a gem and frequent it often
You know an establishment is special when you want to take friends often
I have rarely had such a terrific dining experience
I had a party of seven on a Saturday night and things could not have been nicer
The owner greeted us at the door and turned us over to one of the best waiters in the business
Menu and specials rated really high in our group
Great wines and really good desserts
Our family has eaten at the Grill over many years
Despite the comments , the Grill IS friendly for kids and even grandkids
The management is very helpful and send me an invitation every year on my birthday offering a bottle of champagne
They remember your name and try to accomodate you with the dining times you ask for
What more can you want? Henry Griesman
wonderful food and their bloody mary is the best in the city
After dining at York Grill a few times as well as having enjoyed their outstanding Sunday brunch, we decided everything about the restaurant made it the ideal spot for my mom's birthday brunch
The owners couldn't have been more accomodating -- we had the entire restaurant to ourselves on a Saturday (before it opens to the public for dinner)
The menu, decor, service and naturally the food, were outstanding
We already have reservations to go back for dinner next month
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

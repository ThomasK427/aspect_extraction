Had been here before under previous owner; was underwhelmed
I just went this past weekend, and found the food to be great! Everyone's entree was wonderful, as was the appetizer mix we ordered
The service was timely and courteous (a nice change from some other Bklyn restaurants) and while it wasn't cheap, it certainly was not overpriced
Definitely will be back, and recommend to all to try it out
The decorating is great and the food wasn't bad, but they really need to lose the attitude
Our food took at least an hour and the apps and entrees came at the same time
The staff didn't seem to care about our table, in fact they seemed to relish in our unhappiness
While wining and dining every other table there, we were treated unspeakably rudely
Makes me wonder
I loved the place from the moment I walked in
It wasn't crowded
I was immediately served and the staff was very attentive
My date was also very pleased
The place just has an overall relaxing atmosphere
The food was very good
And after we ate, we went upstairs to the lounge area for drinks and good music
I definitely recommend this place
My-oh-my Fort Greene is getting uppity
Butta Cup is great, if you don't mind the shafting
Neat digs, in the bottom two floors of a brownstone
Nicely appointed, with bars upstairs and downstairs
I ate here once, maybe a year ago, and it seemed like the food was ok
I don't really remember
You can do better in this neighborhood, but it was fine
Now that they've got the porch open, what's to complain about? Plenty: $6 for a Corona? $8 for a glass of wine? Are you kidding me? This is Brooklyn
And not even Park Slope
The Butta Cup seems to change hands every fifteen to twenty minutes
And still they haven't come up with a really good reason for me to wanna hang out here
You wanna dance? Go to Frank's
You wanna score? Try Moe's
On a Saturday night you'll find a line around the block
That's how good the fish is
While your there make sure you get a piece of pie!
Ok, this place has the best southern and caribbean food EVER
Two or three weeks ago, I was written up in the NY Daily News Sunday Section of the top meals under $10
It was ranked number 10
I have to try the first 9 because the food is the excellent
The mac and cheese and yams are as good as anywhere in the south
The curried chicken and jerk chicken is so flavorful, my tongue was wagging when I left
It is a very nice well lit place with a flat screen TV
It has great colors
A must eat place
I have seen plenty of NYs famous in there over the years
Try it!
This is by far some of the best caribbean food you will ever feast on and the family that runs this business is top notch
It is nice to see sisters' doing it for themselves!!!
Nakasaki, well what can I say? I liked it when you leave you are definitely full
The Rice and Peas is served in a bowl I just like it put on my plate
but i really liked it!!
The place is small but cozy and not overcrowded
Service was great
It is as if the people there knew you their whole life
For a miniscule cover and $5 you can enjoy a great performance by great jazz musicians and a glass of wine
And everyone is so friendly
you can see top rate performers in and a comfortably intimate environment for next to nothing! i have not complaints
the sound is great
the service is prompt friendly
you feel like a part of the family
Eat dinner first and go to Sista's Place afterward for great music, drinks, coffee, tea, desserts, etc
Or make this a prelude to a night of dancing
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
Yes I do enjoy a iced cafe mocha every now and then but, alittle toomuch buck in the star
You can'tgo wrong with carmel machiato
Always good for just the blend
a real fix for the coffee craze
A neat place to sit relax and enjoy
We came across this restaurant by accident while at a DUMBO art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh
The service was outstanding
You definitely get the sense that it's family owned and run, but with incredible style
The beautiful stained glass windows, lots of room between table and low lighting make it a great romantic night out
The Scene This elegantly spartan Japanese bistro declares its multifaceted superiority on an amusingly serious placard outside its entrance, and consistently makes good on its promises
Run by a traditional sushi chef and a small, unfailingly polite staff, Gajyumaru is a quiet and cozy place to be--the smaller your party, the better
The Food The straightforward presentation of the omakase (chef's choice) menu is deceptive--each tingling bite reveals fish cuts of superb quality
Creative inspiration is reserved instead for an array of delightful appetizers and entrees, like the palate-cleansing shortneck clam miso soup and the buttery-soft broiled sablefish marinated in sake lees
Consider ordering the appetizer combination order, which includes a variety of dishes to sample
Less adventurous eaters will also leave happy--both noodle dishes (featuring rich broth) and tempura feel light in the belly yet satisfy an appetite of any size
This restaurant has the freshest sushi in town
This restaurant also have the best service ever
This place has consistently good sushi at an affordable price
THe best deal is the sushi for two which considering the solid quality of the sushi is $55
It's more than enough for two people
At any other place, you would have to pay at least $80 for the same quantity and quality
I would whole heartedly recommend this place for the real diehard sushi lover who wants good sushi several times a month but can't afford to pay top dollar every time
Would not recommend for non-sushi lovers since it looks like the neighborhood joint that it is and the cooked foods are just okay
I live in the neighborhood and I visit this restaurant once a week
The sushi is always fresh and full of flavor, buttery and delicious
The appetizers and specials such as homemade tofu, tuna with miso paste, and vinegared crab are wonderful but, honestly, I've never had a dish there I didn't enjoy
The service is very attentive
If you like excellent sushi prepared by a staff who really cares, definitely check it out
Since this place opened, we have been regulars - at least once a week
The chicken nanban is addictive and they really know how to cook udon the right way
Sushi is almost as good as in Tsukiji
I will only eat the chirashi from this place
The freshness of the food was stellar and the service was exceptional
I remember leaving full without going broke and feeling very pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the dining experience
Make reservations - this place fills up every night of the week

Dessert was fair
Other than not being seated promptly, the service was attentive and the atmosphere had a good buzz throughout the night
In all fairness I only went to Mesa Grill once for brunch, so this review might not be representative of what Bobby Flay has to offer
We had a variety of dishes, but they all (including the assortment of breads) had one thing in common--spicy chilies
Now don't get me wrong I love spicy food (to the point my lips burn), but there was no variety, no contrast
The spice was gratuitous
Out of the seven dishes we ordered only two could be called excellent, two very bad, and the rest nothing special
The mixed drinks came in cheap, worn, sratched, water glasses that you normally find at a diner
The service, although polite, not to be found at times
We had to ask for sugar and milk for the coffee, among other things
I went with my family of 4 adults and three children
The childrens ages were 10 yrs, 3
5 years and 2 years
We were seated promptly and offered highchairs for the younger kids
One thing I hate about restaurants is my beverage runnning out
I didn't have to ask for refills (ice tea) they kept and eye on that for me
I recommend Mesa Grill for everyone
Mr Flay knows how to combine heat and flavor like no one else
I first ate at Mesa Grill in fall of 1998 and thought it was pretty good, but now, winter of 2003, nothing has changed much and everything is seeming a bit stale, from the decor, to the chipped plates, to the same 8 or 10 entrees
Don't get me wrong, the food is still good, but it's not exciting and certainly not worth the prices
I can get a much more interesting/exciting/buzz-worthy meal at twenty other restaurants in the city for the same $60/person
And if it is southwestern/latin flavors you're craving, there are more exciting options too: Chicama, Pipa, Boca Chica, Calle Ocho, and Patria all come to mind
Dropped by on a rainy Sunday afternoon for brunch
Promptly seated for our group of ten
Wondeful appetizers
Basket of bread
Then
nothing
No service, water, refills of coffee
just ten of us staring at an empty basket of bread for almost an hour
The waitress was immune to any of our signals for service, or request for an explanation of the delay
When we did hail her down, by practically clotheslining her, she refilled ONE glass of water at the table (for the person who requested it) and sped away too quickly for the oher nine to notice that they were still thirsty
The food was undoubtedly an experience in itself, albeit portions small, but watch out for the remnants of jalapeno peppers in just about everything
Too bad the restaurant experience as a whole was marred by slow and poor service
Too bad they don't just do take-out
THe Mesa Grill will cost you, but its so worth it
The food is GREAT
I've been here a bunch of times and each time I leave satisfied
The portions are pretty small for the money, but this is NY - nobody is giving anything away
Food = Great Service = Not so Great
Drinks = Hungover
Overall, worth it for the food, but go on a quiet night
My favorite restaurant in NYC
Booby Flay gets it right time after time
Although it can be noisy at times and maybe it's become a little pricey, the food is never a dissapointment
The bold favors and textures of his food are truly unique-I've eaten in my share of restaurants, but nothing that even comes close to the taste and flavor combinations he offers
Inside, it's high energy,colorful eclectic decor, and a staff that knows it's product and is eager to help
The goat cheese appetizer is da bomb
the pork entree rocks even more
If you're a new yorker craving for spicy and trendy food, eat here
oh, and the margarita's are super, especially the mesagrill one
I try to eat here as often as i could
the service is pleasant, lots of fun actors
Oh and it ain't cheap, but it's all worth it
The ratings for this restaurant are not even close to representing how good this place really is
Definitely one of the best meals I've had in years
Don't let the comments about a busy atmosphere distract you from trying the great dishes prepared by Bobby Flay
This was the best South-Western style food we have been able to find in NY
My husband grew up in New Mexico and spent a significant amount of time living in Mexico
the food is authentic and creative, the tomale was fantastic --- the best we have been able to get since our latest trip to Acapulco
Bobby Flay is one of my favorite chefs - and his cookbooks are outstanding
Unfortunately, our recent dinner at Mesa Grill was pretty sub-par
The hallmark Sophie's Chopped Salad was limp and unattractively served plain in a bowl
A roasted tomato soup was excellent, and though the roast chicken was good, it had clearly sat under the heater too long which dulled the dish's flavors and lustre
For the price, those simple quality issues are unforgivable
It seemed that a high % of diners were tourists, and that the restaurant has been able to let quality slide - perhaps riding on the chef's fame - yet remain busy
Hopefully they'll get quality back to what the chef's management team should be capable of
I was not disappointed
I was especially impressed with the staff being able to find a party in order to be seated without using loudspeakers or handing out lighted buzzers
The red snapper was heavenly
Despite our reservation and being asked to show up 15 minutes before our reservation time, our party of 4 still had to wait 25 minutes over our reservation time for a table
GOOD THING the food is EXCELLENT! You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu
that part definitely lives up to its reputation
BUT the service wasn't what we expected for such a famous restaurant with a top notch chef
I guess you have to be someone famous too to get the right kind of service
It was good for one try but not worth going back to with so many other great NY restaurants to try
Excellent food on a very exotic menu, great desserts, good wine, nothing about the food was dissapointing except the long wait inspite of having reservations! The bar scene and very popular overcrowded Bobby Flay joint is definitely bopping with wanna be seen crowd, and reservations are highly recommended
The food was very very good and remember to save room for dessert, even if you don't eat for three days after! Definitely a treat!
After all the great things I had heard about Bobby Flay and his cooking style, I was not in the least bit dissapointed
The food was simply delicious and different, very artistic style of cooking and everything on the menu is very tempting, definitely the swordfish with the habanero sauce and the cajun fries! Definitely save room for dessert! The restaurant itself is very crowded, loud and the attitude can be toned a little
The table service was good, however even reservations are not honored in this very hoity fancy place with 4 maitre d's running around trying to accommodate the very popular guests, so be prepared to wait and be seen at this bar scene while they prepare your table, or rather fix the double booking of tables
A friend and I met for brunch and we had one of the best meals ever
The sous chef is extremely creative and innovative!
The food here was incredible
The margaritas were also good, if not a bit strong (but I'd stick to the classic frozen instead of white pear)
The dessert wasn't anything special, and the atmosphere could certainly use some improvement
We sat upstairs, which was nice because it overlooked the whole restaurant and kitchen, but the tables downstairs were clustered and not conducive to a romantic date
The restaurant is carpeted, and complete with a strange decor (enormous, brightly colored pillars and modern art)
It's worth trying for the food, but I wouldn't recommend it for a date
Watch FoodTV and you'll quickly overdose on Bobby Flay
But forget the hype and go for the food
He may be a little hard to take, but he knows how to run a kitchen and put together a creative menu
The brunch, especially, is great and a good value
We visited for a brunch, which allows you to induldge in more than a dinner while noot breaking the bank
The food is an absolute masterpiece, and the service is so good that we thought our table was bugged! A must do
This could be one of the greatest restaurants in the US
The service is by far the best in NYC
The portions are enormous unlike many of the chic restaurants in NYC
Try the tuna tartare - sheer perfection!
Mesa Grill was everything I expected! I had a perfect dining experience

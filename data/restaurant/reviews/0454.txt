The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the food and almost any other topic you might ask them
And, after dinner and dessert-which you should pass on Vera Tong continues to surprise-you are presented with little treats from the pastry kitchen and pecan crusted coffee cakes to take with you
They are great on the walk home, in the cab on the way home, for a midnight snack or for breakfast the next morning
Try eating at the bar when one of the handsome bartenders is on
They will seduce you into a great glass of wine or tantilate you with a homemade cocktail
In a word: GO!!!
The food is excellent and the portions are a decent size
It is rare that I leave these kinds of restaurants full, but Compass does not disappoint
Chef John Fraser, since his arrival in March of 2005, continues to amaze diners who come to Compass
Seasonal changes allow for a variety within the menu of dishes that are staples and pleasing to both the eyes and the tastebuds
The extensive wine list both by the glass and by the bottle is arranged not to be overwhelming
The attentive and knowledgeable staff complete your visit to Compass Restaurant
You will come back again and agian
I cannot disagree more with the previous two reviews
I went to Compass this weekend and I found both the food and the service excellent
I went with a large party and we were immediately greeting by the hostess and seated without delay
Our waiter was friendley and helpful when recomending dishes and wines
My entire party agreed that the restaurant was beautifully decorated also
Some of our favorite appetizers were the Hamachi (soooo fresh), the sea scallops and the crispy skate
In terms of entrees you cant go wrong with the duck and the poached lobster
Just make sure you save room for dessert, they had a pineapple cheesecake that was to die for
I heard they have a great sunday brunch also
thats where i'll be this weekend!
Despite high hopes and a nice facade per my architect companion, dinner was impressively disappointing
Where to begin
Service: poor when present but often absent
We had to ask for the wine list and then waited eons for our server to reappear
Food: The crispy skate so highly touted by the NYTimes reminded me of something I might heat up out of a Ms Pauls box freshly extracted from the freezer
The kitchen seemed to be experimenting with salt using none in dishes where it should have been and an excess in others to the point that they were inedible
Merely adequate desserts were the high point of the meal
Compass fails to impress in every way
6 of my coworkers and myself decided to try this rest out for rest week b/c one had heard such great things about it and I don't know who left the rest of these reviews but it must be investors or ppl that work there b/c this place was without a doubt A WASTE OF MONEY thank god it was rest wk
It took us about 3+hrs to eat b/c the waiter only came by once an hr needless to say the service was horrible and the food was mediocre at best
You would expect a nice place like this not to have mounds of fat on their meat
Their portions are very small and not rich in taste at all
Only thing I have nice to say is the decor is nice and the dessert was ok
For whatever reason, this place is very excellent and never crowded
The large bar/wine bar area is a great place to chill; they have 30 or so wines available by the glass, tapas and dinner menus available, and the prix fixe menu (with or without pairings) is the best deal I've seen in a while
Just don't tell anyone :-), would hate to see it overrun like so many others in this neighborhood
Took my gfriend for her bday last Friday
We were blown away
The prix fixe w/the pairings is one of the best deals in NY
Every dish was executed perfectly: Salmon tartar, duck cavatelli, hake and short ribs
The pairings complimented very well and the pours very generous
I could go on and on
I highly recommend it
The beautifully plated delicious masterpieces prepared by the staff of the chef John Fraser are expertly matched by the sommelier Edward Allen with wines from the Wine Spectators Award of Excellence collection
Ask for a tasting menu and, if you lucky, enjoy a dozen of courses of the innovative delight
Or try these appetizers: Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Black Truffle Risotto, Lobster and Kumamoto Oysters Rockefeller; and the entrees: Free Range Chicken, Braised Sturgeon, Seared Breast of Long Island Duck and Braised Leg in Pastilla
Do not pass on desert!  Sophisticated, contemporary appropriately lighted, airily and cozy interior, welcoming professional staff
Terrific food and service, great value
Enjoy!
I was there late with a group for a birthday get-together
It took forever to get the bartender's attention
That's fine
they only had one for our private room and the main room
I ordered 2 cranberry/club sodas which they said they would put on a tab
About 1/2 hr later, they bring over the bill, not at our request
Okay, I thought maybe the waitress was ending her shift
The total was $8
99
alright, so it was overpriced
I looked closer at the bill and realized they CHARGED GRATUITY ON 2 NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS! Not only was it charged, but it was 20% of the total after tax
After another hour, she comes by to announce last call
I will never go to this restaurant again and plan on telling all my friends how terrible their service is
had dinner at Comapass last night
Heard about the new chef coming from French Laundry and so my expecatations were very high and I was not disappointed
Amazing!!
the service was excellent, and the food was great - highly recommend - new chef is creating excellent dishes - the cod is very good - and so was the lobster!!! - grilled scallops to start was a great choice - I would try the tuna tartar next time!! heard it was also a great dish!
Luckily for me I think my friends and I ended up at the best table! It's the one in the picture with the centerpiece
The food was good and the service was great
I liked the fact that we were able to sit at a round table, which I find few restaurants have
I had a great experience with my party yesterday
The service and the food were exceptional! I would highly recommend it for big parties or a romantic getaway
The staff is very attentive as well as helpful! Thank you Julio for making our night just so much better
Expect us back!
Never did I expect that this would become one of my favorite restaurants!  I was warmly greeted by the restaurant personnel
The service was efficient and courteous from beginning to end
I was much impressed by the quality of the food
I can't say I've had a finer porterhouse and the appetizers were exquisite
The desserts we ordered put a fine finish to the meal
But how we felt walking in the restaurant, how we were treated, and how we felt leaving left us aglow on the way to the opera, and we couldn't have asked nor expected more
I will return many times, I'm sure
I love Compass, and have gone to eat there once a month since it opened
The food is great, I've never been dissappointed, and the desserts are even better
Service is crisp and for the most part timely, and they always make me feel right at home there
As for those people who claim their waiter didn't know anything about wine I have a suggestion: Try asking for the Sommelier! That's what a wine steward is for, and Compass has the best wine man in the city
NO waiter is expected to have tried and memorized the upwards of 500 wines Compass offers!
had dinner with a friend on a friday night
the place was pretty empty and got emptier as the night progressed (ie popularity has diminished greatly)
the decor was nice, but the food was so-so
what did we have? tuna tartar was yummy, steak was decent-good, duck was blah and tough, chocolate souffl and ice creams were tres yummy
similar to the other reviewer's experience, the waiter had no idea about the wines and tried to BS his way through it
we did end up having a $50 bottle of cote du rhone and it was great
bottom line
not a great value for blah entrees
Came here looking for fine food and a good wine list Great NY decor, great feel walking in Wine list was impressive - shame nobody knew the wines Good wines below $100 hard to find Wines by the glass uninspired Food was flat - expensive, and dull Prix Fixe looked good value - went a la carte - clearly a mistake A decent bottle of cote rotie, an overcooked steak, tough duck we left $300 lighter  All in all a dissappointment The night improved - some great jazz at the Zinc Bar If you're into wine and find food - I would suggest Cru
We heard lots of great things about the food at Compass, which was all true! However, I went to dine there last week with my husband; the french server almost spoiled the wonderful compass experience, as he called it with his arrogance
Please, not everyone is there to be impressed by you, so don't try too hard
I'm sure most of the other waiters are ok, we just had a though luck with ours!

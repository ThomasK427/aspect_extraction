If you want a good deal on Polish or Ukranian food, go over to 1st ave to one of the diners between 10th and 14th Street -- Neptune or similar
Lots of good food for a very reasonable price and lovely back yard seating
Leave Veselka for the unsuspecting tourists
They will be duped into eating their lame brunches
Have only been here once
You know those places where you sit down and look at the menu and you can't decide what to order because so many things sound good? This is one of those places
A good mix of tradional diner offerings mixed in with great-sounding Ukrainian options
Opted for the Deluxe Meat Combo Plate - portions weren't huge
but enough to fill me up
Everything was good
I now only feel the need to go back to try all the other things I didn't order the first time
My grandma used to take me here when I was little
she used to tell me that they were the only people in the world that make pierogis like hers
And it's true
Maybe I'm biased, but this is a great dive-y type place to go on the LES with a couple of friends before a big night of drinking
Try the beet salad, yum! The pierogis, of course, the borscht with sour cream, and if you're really daring, give the kasha varnishkes a shot
One bad thing - the Ukrainian beer - tastes like Shlitz
The servers ARE weird, but nice
I freakin' love Veselka
(That means 'rainbow,' by the way
like the pot of gold at the end of it!)
If you're looking for great comfort food in a slightly funky, very busy setting, this is the place to go
This is a solid diner, but a diner nonetheless
Veselka's does offer one of the best cups of coffee in the city (when the brew is fresh)
If you're going for weekend brunch, try the raspberry pancakes
The desserts are also solidly respectable, if you still have room after all those pierogi
It's amazing how many restaurants there are in New York City that rate mediocre at best
Given the number of great establishments you can eat at on every type of budget, mediocrity is not something that should be tolerated in New York
Veselka perhaps slips under the radar because of their eclectic menu -- I can't think of too many places where I can choose between pierogies, chili, mac and cheese, and borscht -- to name a few
But sadly, everything I've tried here is just ok; fine if you're passing by and need a quick bite
But for those people who tolerate the long lines, especially for weekend brunch -- move on
There's plenty of other much better eats in the area
Growing up on homemade Polish food may not sound great to many, but after tasting a few bites of my mothers cooking you would change your mind
I never thought anyone matched her skill in the kitchen, but Veselka does up some of my classic favorites to delight
Try the glumpki (stuffed cabbage) or Peirogies (like ravioli's)
They will not disappoint
having used to work at a bakery where the closing shift ended at 1:30 in the morning, i've grown to appreciate how rare it is to find a really good place to eat that's open any time of day
veselka does breakfast all day and night, and their waffles with raspberry sauce are killer (they make a mean omlette too)
unfortunately my friends and I rarely get the chance to enjoy all their wonderful food
because we've gotten so addicted to their bacon burgers
a good burger with everything is hard to find in this city
at least when you want it under ten dollars
the only one i've had in manhattan to beat veselka's is at the corner bistro, which unfortunately has disappointing fries
veselka does not have this liability
This place was simply excelltent, with great staff, service and value
Highly recommended!
the mashed potatoes are not too good
the egg noodle side dish is even worse
my order of egg noodles seemed either very old, or undercooked
i think it was both
the corner i sat in was infested by fruit flies
the place itself is nice
the service is teeters between mediocre and bad
This restaurant has potential but the food was just OK and the service was bad
I felt uncomfortable in the atmosphere
which makes comfort food not as grand
I used to love going there for their stuffed cabbages
They used to make them perfect
I recently ordered it twice and they seem to go downhill
Why? Twice it came back burnt, the filling was hard and burnt and nothing as delicious it used to be
Overall, i love their food portions
Great home warming meals and quick service
Veselka has good diner food in a comfortable atmosphere
Everyone in your group will be able to find something they like and everyone will leave satified
Veselka is my absolute FAVORITE place to eat late at night- the food is filling, delicious, and fresh
My favorites are the boiled potato perogis, the cheese blintzes, and the coffee
My fiance LOVES the soups, especially the cold borscht (served with great bread)
The service isn't wonderful, but they get the job done, and quickly enough
It actually adds to the authenticity (Czech servers are known to be a bit brusque)
Overall, I highly recommend a trip to Veselka, especially after a late night out
Just so good! Perogies just like my grandfather used to make
My husband and I love the cabbage soup so much, we can't wait for cooler weather to arrive!
Veselka is one of those East Village 24 hour burgs where the food is rich, and the service bites
Go for the Goloush, the Ukranian Meatballs, the potato pancakes, the blintzes, or the burgers, it's all great, and really cheap
You don't have to make fun of fellow New Yorkers, like Eek and his Taliban buddies do, all you have to do is sit back get a great meal, look at the mural, or through the large sidewalk windows and enjoy yourself!
Try the Cheese Blintzes and a Mediteranian Omelette
Be prepared to wait 30mins on Sat/Sun 'morning' (2-4)
Service sucks, but the coffee is good
join the older locals and laugh at the yuppies and hipsters while getting some of the best bargains around
not the 'best' food, but, something for everyone can be found on the menu
sometimes service can be slow - just pretend it's your grandma
I have never had worse service in my life
I gave this place three chances and each time a different waitress was more rude and less intelligent than I could imagine
The food took forever, and not because it was coming out of the kitchen, it just sat on the counter until they decided we should eat
Then after asking for water it was another 10 min
Not to mention they drop the check on the table right after you order your meal, forgetting they have a dessert menu
Lastly, the food was horrible
Veselka is my number-one spot for Cheap Eats
Yes, a combination plate will run you $8
95, and you might be able to find a cheaper entree elsewhere
But a combination plate gives you a salad, soup, unlimited (and excellent) challah bread, four pierogi, and a big stuffed cabbage
The food is incredible, and the other choices are equally large-portioned for the price
You can go a whole day on a Veselka meal, and since they're open 24 hours, I sometimes do
i love the food here
my boyfriend's family is ukranian (his mother is a fantastic cook), and HE loves the food
it's a very good deal
the service is sort of slow, but what do you expect--it's a diner
the cold borsht here is excellent, as well as the many different kinds of pierogis and meatless stuffed cabbage
I have a group of friends that sees a fair amount of theater on the LES, and we always make it a point to trek over to Veselka afterwards
I have two words: raspberry blintzes

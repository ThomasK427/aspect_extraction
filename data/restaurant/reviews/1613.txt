still the best overall dining experience in town
note to non-foodies from points hither: stick to the tavern room, not the back dining room, for quicker, inexpensive, tasty grub
the dining room is for professionals
I couldn't disagree more! Although we aren't from NYC we visit friends two or three times per year and we always try a minimum of four restaurants that we haven't been to
Gramercy was highly recommended from the concierge at the 60 Thompson so we went
The ambiance was outstanding, as was the service
but the food was marginal at best
The seating is cozy to say the least so we were able to overhear other patrons with the same type of comments
small
more artsy than edible
hype
Anyway, you can always count on Aquavit, Gotham, River Cafe, Union Square, Elaine's or Carmine's or Angelo's for Italian
A friend raved about Daniel's too
Went there for my husband's birthday
Made the reservation a month in advance and got an 8:00 PM table for 4
When we got there, our table wasn't quite ready, so we waited
30 minutes past, people who got there after us with the same 8:00 PM reservations got seated before us
Needless to say, I was furious
As it turned out, the maitre'd seated another party of 4 instead of us by mistake when we were standing like 4 feet in front of him
A good restaurant can be ruined by an incompetent staff
I have nothing but praise for this establishment
The food excellent and well prepared
Fresh meats, fish, and vegetables
The drinks were well prepared and the wine list was extensive to say the least
The place also makes for a very romantic setting or comfortable to hang with friends
Finally, The service was impeccable
EXCELLENT!
We have been waiting for months for a 8pm reservation at this very average restaurant
I must say the ambience was fine, bartender was very competent and nice
But food was extremely average
My wife's salad was over salted, my scalops had a very fishy taste, chicken was more than plain, diner style vegetables , monkfish too hard and how about some spices!!! Waitress had no ideas about wines
But the dessert were delicious
Go there to have a dessert at the bar, that's it!!!
After attempting to make reservations at Gramercy Tavern 5 times over the past six months, I asked that they tell me when the next 7pm reservation was available
it was 3 weeks later on a Tuesday
I happily took the reservation
A day before my reservation I received a confirmation call from GT asking that I call back before 12pm the day of to confirm my 6:30 reservation
When I called back to confirm, I was told that 7pm might have been what I asked for but this is what they gave me!
what's the point of making a reservation? The receptionist didn't even try to accomodate the mistake
- Hopefully the meal will be better than the reservation experience!
I've eaten at the best restaurants in NYC, Santa Fe, New Orleans, LA, etc
GT ranks in the top 3
People who complain about the service are used to Dennys' 15 minute meals
People who complain about the food should stay home and open another can of Manwich
In other words, if you don't like GT, you won't like any good restaurant
Stick to pizza and beer
I was lucky enough to celebrate my birthday at Gramercy Tavern - and everything about it was amazing
The service was unbelievable - and the food was unforgettable
They even gave us a coffee cake so that I could be reminded the next morning how great my experience was
Serice was effortless - we were helped by 5 different people, so we didn't have to wait for our server
Orientation was getting us what we wanted quickly
But it didn't feel rushed - everyone was relaxed and friendly
Decor is beautiful
Food - outstanding
Front room is great if you haven't made reservations, it's just as classy
Truly enjoyed ourselves
One of my favorite restaurants in the world
The atmosphere in the front is charming enough, but the dining rooms have the ubiquitious over-designed David Rockwell feel
Overall the place feels corporate and contrived
The appetizers were very good, but the entrees (we tried six) were very average, and at the prices this is a BIG disappointment
Yes, the desserts are all that Claudia Fleming created, fun and tasty
I hated the service--no warmth, again too corporate
My husband and I came here for lunch and waited over an hour for our food
When we finally inquired, they sent the manager over to apologize, as the order had been overlooked
We were promised a gift certificate by mail, which never materialized
The one bowl of soup I had was bland and lukewarm
I would not recommend this establishment
What an amazing experience my party (six) had at Grammercy
With all the restaurants to choose from in NYC this restaurant did not disappoint
Our service was incredible
The menu was diverse and the food was out of this world
We sampled six desserts and each was to die for
My husband and I had dined here 7 years ago and we were delighted we returned
I will definitely go back the next time I am in NYC
I've been in a modest number of fine restaurants, but Gramercy Tavern puts every place else to shame
Service was was friendly and thoroughly accessible, yet completely professional and decorous, and paced perfectly
The vegetable tasting (7 course) menu was a stunning presentation, doubly so as it used no non-vegetable ingredients
The cheese cart just about made me cry for joy
The chocolate tart is a desert to devastate all comers
I don't get the bad reviews
service was the best i'd ever seen - from the hostess to all of the waiters that served us (they even gave us a a couple of deserts to sample on since the chocolate tart was taking longer than expected)
food was really good, esp the deserts
it was expesive though, esp since you have to order either the $68 prix fixe menu or the $95 tasting menu
i want to try the tavern room next time
I finally found the perfect combination of service, ambiance and food
I felt as if everyone on staff was tuned to providing a wonderful dining experience--just for me! The little, free surprise offerings were a delight
It is truly one of the best restaurants in NYC
It may be a bit expensive but they do deliver satisfaction in the end
So I guess once in a while you need to open up the wallet to get a royal treatment
Expect a few minutes wait either at the entrance or the bar to get your table
They are quiet busy almost all the time, it must come with being one of the most popular dining spots in the city
Impressive Wine Selection with some rare wines
A great dish for every taste
Also a great desert menu
If I am not mistaken the owner of this restaurant also owns the 11 Madison Park and Tabla
They are all upscale dining establishments with one thing in their mind; Client Satisfaction
That is my opinion
I was satisfied
I don't care! The food is good, but the prices are ridiculous
Decor is faux tavern, and too claustrophobic

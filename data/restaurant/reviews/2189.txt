I mean so hidden that this place has no outdoor signs
It's actually in a basement level of an office building
So you're probably going ew right about now
Oh, you have no idea what you're missing
One of the few AUTHENTIC Japanese spots in New York City, Sakagura boasts tasty Japanese cuisine with *200+* variations of sake
Damn
Be warned, this is the kind of place you run up a bill and you have NO idea how it happened because you're just having too much fun
GREAT food, GREAT drinks
A very smooth atmosphere and the most unique bathrooms you've EVER seen
Extra props to the hostesses who were extremely kind to our party
A 5 star experience all the way
a treasure-- the cooked food is *really* good but the portions are *really* small (note, however, the sashimi is only mediocre to above average) and the desserts are top notch
i go there mostly for the tasty 200 sakes by the glass!
Defniitely one of the most amazing Japanese restaurants NYC has to offer
The Izakaya style menu is truly amazing and partners wonderfully with the excellent sake selection
The staff there is very friendly and offers great advice on Sake / food paring, should you have any questions
The price is a little high - but well worth it
I've never needed to make reservation when I go, and was always seated within a reasonable amoutn of time
The food and ambiance here are wonderful
The small dishes were beautifully prepared and presented -- especially good were the yuba dumplings and the shrimp balls wrapped in almonds
Our server was really knowledgable about sake, and guided us to two delicious ones
The one problem is that for three hungry people, ordering lots of little dishes soon mounted up to a lot more than we were expecting to spend, so bring lots of cash or your credit card
This place is really hidden
The decor is cozy and comfy
Saki heaven I'd like to call this place, a place where u can enjoy the great selection of saki's and enjoy lil tapa dishes to go with your saki
The food is wonderful, japanese style fried chicken, grilled squid, toro to die for and shrimp rolls are just a few great things here
The only downside was the service was slow and our waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks
Other then that this is a place to visit if you want to have a great time! enjoy!
i live in the area and was totally stoked to discover this place
tucked away in the basement of an office bldg on a street loaded w/ parking garages and car rentals, this is a real find
don't let the stark lobby and shady stairwell discourage you
once you enter you'll find sakagura to be a sanctuary
good food and a wide variety of sake
the sake menu is mostly in japanese, but the friendly unpretentious staff will help out
A friend and I went to Sakagura after a concert, and were blown away by the authentic izakaya atmosphere, tasty food and mind-boggling sake selection
The whole experience -- including the warm, helpful service -- made me feel like I was in Tokyo again
My only regret is that we didn't make reservations -- we waited 10 minutes to be seated, but I've been told the wait is often much longer
It can get pricey, but ordering a bunch of tapas and splitting them up helps reduce the cost a bit
If you want to try Japanese, pleeease!!! do not go to Benihana, do not order Tempra, do not believe Teriyaki is the Japanese food
Go to a place like this and order what Japanese are ordering
Yes, I am Japanese from Japan
Don't know what Izakaya is? Go and see
It works pretty much similar to a Tapas bar
It is best to go with few people and order many appetizer dishes
I love it that this place is located in the basement of non-descriptive office building
Once you passed the harsh fluorescent light in the lobby, and walked downstairs, it's a totally different world
Staff is always courteous and knowledgeable so you don't need to be a sake expert! Food is also EXCELLENT!!! It is best you call ahead and make a reservation
New Yorkers tend to believe all Japanese eat is sushi
Sakagura offers almost no raw fish items, but instead, dishes that Japanese enjoy back home
The enormous selection of sake along with explanation amazed me every time I visit
Words got around - it used to be a hidden treasure of Japanese bar scene
Well, I cannot blame anyone
It is trendy and clean like any Japanese sake bar in Tokyo!
If you want to immerse yourself in sake, this is the place
I love their special tasting nights, which offer the chance to sample excellent, fragrant sakes from dozens of Japanese breweries
Was visting Manhattan, and went to visit the UN
Me and my friends wanted to try out a new place
We came across Sichuan
We looked at the menu, kind of pricey, but we tried it anyways
The food was fantastic
Beyond any of our comprehnsion
If you want good chinese food, this is the place
Also for those who dont know, Sichuan stands for spicy, so many of the dishes are spicy
But, this is first class chinese food, and if you get the chance you shouldnt pass it up
We went there with a large party and the food and service was superb
I'm from Hong Kong and the chinese food here is excellent! There isn't the typically dish-dumping like many other chinese restaurants, all dishes were brought out one by one
If you're looking for cheap eat, there a Wok-n-Roll down the block but for quality chinese food Sichuan Palace gets it right
Dinner with wine ran $40/person
Get the House Spicy Prawns if you check this place out
They're a steal for $20
for $10
95 all you can eat, it's a great deal
the food tastes authentic
you can't go wrong
everything is so flavorful
I just found out Ray manages Oh!Raku, a sister spot to his Raku on 47th st
Angie his mgr took care of my group with free milky sake dessert
the food served on a moving belt was pretty kool for 1st timers, but have to admit a bit pricey
their spicy tuna is a different recipe, not to our liking, better at Raku
liked their lychee martini red bean ice cream the best I have tasted in long time
their cinco de mayo roll is good but not as good as Raku's
otherwise, a nice busy place to go for lunch
Thks Ray/angie for making us feel welcomed
clients liked it (tho we have tasted better sushi elsewhere)
It went to Genki particularly for kaiten sushi (pick your own sushi in various style from the conveyor belt) on a Thursday night, there's nothing on the belt but the same 5 dishes of sushi rotated on it repeatedly
The tiny pieces of sushi looked stale and tasted mushy, the caviar was dyed in horrifying green and red
The menu is pricy (range from $3
5 /2 pc
/dish
A big rip off
Service is dissatisfying
There were 2 people with straight faces (seemingly not waiter waitress)walking in n' out the kitchen giving me and the rest of the few customers a weird look
I heard that the place is ok during lunch but I would definitely NOT recommend it for dinner
In addition, it is NOT the only Kaiten sushi in town, there is always this big 'E---' for authentic Japanese sushi and friendly service that worth your money
I found out this is sister to Raku on 47th/bwy managed by Ray - he changed the name upgraded the menu quality
My poor review of old Genki Sushi no longer applies
This is a great looking spot, place is still busy during lunch can order much off menu w/ expanded choices
Sweet ebi, white tuna, scallops better tuna now available
Also special rolls are added treat but a little pricey for this spot (better at Raku)
Svc much improved w/ all asian staff

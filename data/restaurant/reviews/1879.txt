The service is prompt and the staff genuine and friendly
The food was great as well
I have been to some of the most expensive and trendiest restaurants in the city and few match the service and quality of this little place
The Scene Under a faded awning in the heart of the Village, one of New York's most esteemed Italian restaurants remains as if in a timewarp
It's blindingly dark in the dining room, yet tuxedoed career waiters manage to perform as many tableside theatrics as possible, from whisking Caesar salad dressing from scratch to ceremoniously tearing the foil from a whole bass
It's a loud room, full of portly regulars with loosened ties and pink, wine-drunk cheeks
The Food This is old-school Italian cuisine
Meals begin with assorted antipasti, which are simply brought to the table the instant you sit down
Waiters then recite an impossibly long list of specials; pay attention or you'll miss out on voluptuous porcini mushroom ravioli or hefty lamb chops with rosemary crust
From the canneloni to the veal parmigiana, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better place to indulge in classic Italian food
Although the appetizers supplied by the restaurant were outstanding, generally speaking I was disappointed with the food
The pastas were tasty, but not outstanding
If I am going to pay that much for food, I expect to have my socks knocked off (as I have when dining (everytime) at Nobu
The bartender was excellent
I felt that we were rushed at the table when almost done dining (which I wasn't)
I don't think we'll be back
They kept us waiting for more than an hour WITH a reservation and WITHOUT an apology
Admittedly, they fed us some bread while we waited, but that's not an excuse
I'm a vegetarian, and after specifically asking for a vegetarian entree, they gave me an entree that contained seafood
Again, no apology - one of our several waiters simply blamed the others
When they brought grappa for the table, one waiter even commented sarcastically that he was pretty sure *this* was vegetarian
The food overall ranged from decent to quite tasty, but the service was condescending and indifferent
Also, the tables were stuffed together and the place was cramped
This made the wait especially unpleasant
Avoid Il Mulino
The food was to die for and the service was wonderful
The decor is alright, their food portions is more than enough for two, however this place costs a pretty penny
A dinner for two with a bottle of wine would probably cost you close to $300!
Take it from a regular - It simply is not what it used to be!  In the past it was outrageously expensive but great; a special occasion place to splurge
Now days, it is a dated overpriced shadow of its yonder years
The food is mediocre at best
The pasta is bland and you can get better at your grocery store
Their sauces are dissapointing
The canneloni, once famous, now is simply terrible
Their fish is OK as well as the meat entrees but not at their prices, you leave with the feeling someone just picked your pocket
If you plan on drinking a decent wine think $150 minimum for wines other restaurants sell for less
If you want a good wine, bring a letter of credit
Their decanting is awfull; they simply gush it into a glass pitcher, sediment and all
You will fare better at any Little Italy Restaurant or Mid-Town establishment
As for me and my friends, they lost some very good clients
my bf i came expecting to wait at least an hour (w/reservation), so we were pleasantly surprised to be seated 40 minutes after arrival
once seated, we were served a plethora of antipasti/breads (all tasty, with an especially good spicy crispy zucchini bread)
as appetizers, we ordered the zucchini flowers (rich savory) escargot-topped mushroom caps (mediocre)
we split the porcini ravioli for the 2nd course
it was the best ravioli ever plump, al dente, stuffed with mushrooms and drowned in a truffle cream sauce
for the main course, i ordered the snapper (a huge fish in a tomato-based sauce) and he had the rack of lamb
both were good, though not extraordinary
though stuffed, we shared the mixed berries in zabaione (perfect)
it was an expensive meal ($250, no alcohol), so im not sure that its worth a return trip, but i had an awesome time
IVE BEEN TO THE BEST AND SO CALLED THE BEST EATERIES IN THE CITY BUT THEY ARE SECOND THE NONE AT THIS ONE,I CANT BELIVE THE SERVICE THAT YOU GET HERE AND THE FOOD IS THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN THE CITY,IF YOU THINK IT IS PRICEY LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
I RATHER PAY MORE FOR A GREAT DINNER THEN PAY LESS FOR AN OK DINNER SO SAVE UP AND GO TO IL MULINO YOU WILL ALWAYS GO BACK
This is my favorite restuarant in nyc
The service can be a little chaotic at times, but the experience is unmatched
Go when you have time
Once seated, there is a continuous flow of antipasti, and wine, menus are not even handed to you for 20 minutes, giving plenty of time to sample
We sat for 4 hours
The food is wonderful, and it keeps coming and coming
Portions are huge, you'll need to take home the leftovers
I did this last night, and there were no funny looks or arrogant sneers
In fact, I may have gotten funny looks if I tried to eat my whole meal
Dining at Il Mulino is not just a meal, it is indeed an experience
It's true
you might have made a reservation, but you will end up waiting for about an hour anyway, so hopefully you'll get a seat at the bar and won't have to stand around
I've been here twice and had to wait an hour each time
Still, after all the fuss, the food makes you forget about the wait
The food is incredible here
hands down, the best Italian food in the city
Not to mention, my table was next to John Ridder and Joyce DeWitt's table
always nice to sit next to a star in a small restaurant
Although it says make a reservation and confirm, it's only a mere formality
When you get to the restaurant be prepared to wait
The maitre'd was quite rude and didn't acknowledge our presence
I had a reservation for 8:30 and didn't get seated until 9:30
Once seated the food was excellent - the porcini mushrroms and the lamb were superb
If you plan on going to Il Mulino grab a snack before you go because you will be waiting
At one time this was one of the premier Italian resturants, no more, the food is average, service is horrendous, its crowded, overpriced and it needs to be completely refurbished
This is truly the most overhyped resturant in new york
Although the food was great, it wasn't worth the headache
We waited almost two hours for a table (and we had a reservation), they screwed up our bill twice, and they couldn't have cared less
If you're willing to be treated like crap for the opportunity to hand over a few hundred bucks, more power to you
My advice - find a great neighborhood Italian spot, order twice as much to drink as you would at Il Mulino for half the price, and laugh all the way home at the poor suckers still waiting to be seated
I came there with my boyfriend on Tues and had a great time
The food was the best Italian food I have ever had and it was well worth the price
The staff was great friendly and funny
Make sure that you save space to eat you will want to try everything
I cant wait to go there again
Absolutely fantastic food!!! Nothing to compare it to
and I have eaten at them all
Our group of four dined at Il Mulino and had a wonderful experience
We did not have to wait at all for our table
Service was amazing - all kinds of wonderful (free) food to start
Quite small interior, however, we sat at a table and it felt quite private
Menu is a bit difficult to decipher, but the waiters are extremely helpful and will answer any question
We each had an appetizer, pasta dish, entree and desert as well as a few moderately priced bottles of wine ($50 range) each a recommendation - quite good - I recommend the Fettucini Al Fredo as a pasta dish - melted in my mouth
Dined for about 4 hours - This place is not cheap (around $800 for the four of us including the wine and four courses) so dine on an expense account and an empty stomach!
I used to live in Italy for three years, and i know what is real true Italian food is
I am so glad that i found this place
They have wonderful service, every waiters are very friendly and helpful
The wine lists are great, and the Food is amazing!! The reservation is pretty hard to get, but try to call them around 10am, and you could probably get a reservation within 2-3 weeks
I also visit Il mulino in Las vegas

Especially, when I'm paying high prices to eat at a 4 table hole in the wall
I had dinner with my friend, and regardless of our $100 check, I overheard the waiter say that we had been there too long
We were still eating! They came over 3 times to try to take away our half full plates
Finally when it came time to pay the bill, they asked us to get up from the table because they needed it for customers
Oh, I'm sorry I thought we were customers? If you want to spend money to eat in a hurry while they hover over you, then you will love this place
My suggestion is take the burrito to go
Fantastic food with some delightful creativty
Worth paying the slightly high price (but certainly far less than Radio Mexico who also serve great Mexican food)
The long wait and the cramped quarters might be slightly irritating though
Highly recommend!
I can't say enough great things about the food at this tiny resturant
Though I heard it was good I did not expect to be blown away my meal
I had the enchiada - my dining partner had the burrito
The mole sauce was FANTASTIC - very sweet
The special salsa was like no salsa I've ever had - pureed tomatos and creamy! Expect a wait b/c the place is very small but once inside take a break from that diet for a night and indulge
About 2 yrs after moving from L
A
I was still searching this city for decent Mexican food
Coming across Mexicana Mama made me realize I had no clue about what was decent Mexican food
About the wait - be prepared to - it isn't just anyplace offering top notch cuisine for about $25 all in
Sorry L
A
! you can keep your rice and beans
I've been on the search for good Mission style San Francisco flavors
Mexicana Mama's got it going on
All their dishes are interesting and well prepared
I highly recommend either chickens
Specials are great and the mole sauce is the best I've had in a while
The place is small and it's usually crowded, but it's hard to find great, reasonable Mexiacn in NY
Well worth the tight squeeze, and the service has always been attentive and friendly
Everytime I go here I order something different, and I'm always pleased
The variety of sauces on each plate makes for consistently tasty combinations, and the salsas are dynamite! Go for the specials -- they always deliver
And don't forget about the appetizers
It's better to show up with a date or a couple friends -- no more than 4 total -- as seating is VERY limited
Try the hanger steak and don't forget a margarita or two
I'm hesitant to turn more people on to this place, as it gets crowded enough already, but I feel as if it's my duty
This place offers excellent food from a limited menu
Extremely small, it doesn't have much room to be creative in the kitchen or provide comfortable dine-in seating
The items on the menu are rich, but all start to taste the same, which makes eating there often a bit boring
If you are in the mood for their pork tacos, they do deliver!
The BEST salsa in NYC
Although the tiny space is crowded and hot (you will be dining with strangers) the food is exceptional and a great value
Where else can you get Mexican favorites prepared by a classically trained chef? I rarely go in on the weekends, but I order delivery from here at least once a week
Why are they closed on Mondays?
please, all tourists and people who have no sense of humor
this is a great little place for a great meal
not very strong on amenities, however, i love the idea that you can get a great meal for a reasonable price in one of the nicest neighborhoods in the city
anyone who cannot tolerate waits, small places or good food PLEASE STAY UPTOWN
My girlfriend and I have tried several of the top rated Mexican restaurants in NYC and Mexciana Mama clearly has the best tasting food as well as the most reasonable prices(we have since been to MM dozens of times)
Here's a tip: ALWAYS order the special hot appetizer of the day
It is ALWAYS delicious
The meat specials are consistently juicy and flavorful and the portions are generous across the menu
The chicken mole quesadillas are the best!
The place is cozy/tiny and there is usually a line for dinner unless you get there early or for lunchtime
If you want to spend less $$ for better food, Mexicana Mama is the place!!!!
that the waiting is horrific but the food is great
The guacamole was awesome
Everyone enjoyed everything that they had
Too bad the other people waiting for our tables were standing right over us, staring at us like vultures
But, we had done the same thing to the people before us
But still, I would go back
But maybe for an early meal - like before seven
Great Food
If you're willing to wait through their lies
The waiter told me 20 minutes
After 30 minutes of waiting in the cold, we kept getting the run-around
Finally we were seated after 1 hour
In the cold
An hour of time listenting to the waitress BLATANTLY lie to every incoming party that the wait time is only 20 minutes
The food was great
The lies weren't
Then again, after making everyone wait so long I'm sure a Big Mac would've tasted great
Maybe it's a ploy on their part
the run down decor is very deceiving
i was pleasantly surprised that the food we were delivered was of much higher quality than you get at most other mexican joints
the chicken breast dishes were well prepared, and the rib-eye skewer special was great (after being sent back once for a little more cooking
) staff was pleasant and cute
this place is not good for groups or business dinners, but would be good for a first or second date
although the decor is a bit trashy, the food is top notch
try going at off-peak times to avoid a terrible wait
Although the wait is long and quarters cramped, Mexicana Mama is still worth it! Better yet, if you live in the neighborhood, it's an excellent order in restaurant
The menu is very good, but the best dishes are the specials
Especially the fish special
without a doubt one of the best values for fish in town
The flavors are bold and unique and the fish is always of top quality (very very fresh!)
The food was great, but almost everyone I interacted with at this restaurant was rude
I came with a group of 3 on a Saturday
The host told us the wait would be at least 30 minutes, and when we left and came back (because the place is the size of a shoebox) after 20 minutes, he'd seated the group after us
We had to wait another 30 minutes, and then the three of us were seated at a table for two
Then, after waiting an hour for the table, the manager (I think) tried to rush us out
The food is good, but not good enough to support such rude service
Benny's is great
You can split a burrito and walk out satiated
BUT, Mexican Mama is the classy variety of Mexican food
Their burritos are sliced and arranged on their end so you can see the food inside
Served with a tastey pumpkin-like sauce and a sprig of celantro
Very tastey
THeir margaritas are also excellent
I have only ever had a burrito here because they're so good, I can't go past it
But the other food looks equally as brilliant

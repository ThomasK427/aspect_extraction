Went here with four friends (five total) and the waitress made us sit at a table for 4 ! She said that it was in case they became busy, they needed the space and it wasn't that busy ! I asked her what if we were six then she said that we could have more space, she was rude and very unaccomodating
She persisted in arguing with me about joing another table with ours, so that the fifth person could have some eating space ! After this we never saw this waitress again, she ignored us and every other server didn't even look our way
At the end of this fiasco we waited about 15 minutes for the check
It was an embarassing experience for me in front of my friends that I had invited
The only thing that I could suggest is go alone and sit at the counter
This fast food style restaurant charges 20% service fee for groups of 5 people, which was not stated on the menu
When we asked the waiter about it, he was very rude and told us, dont come here in a group then
They figure they can make up their costs by ripping off customers on service charges
Average sushi with terrible service
I will never eat here again!
This used to be one of my favorite places-- but in light of recent changes, this is on my places to avoid list
Some of their servers are completely rude and their undocumented policy of charging 20%+ (post-tax) on groups is beyond me
Before I was happy enough to give a big tip, but when really turns me off when a budget sushi place like this forces it on you
Their raw fish has become inconsistent in quality as of late too
Three months ago, my rating would have been much more positive
but alas, this business is getting worse and worse
This is actually a korean restaurant with a sushi bar
It is operated by korean
The sushi is not very authentic
The service is the typical asian restaurant service
Every server is your server
No one knows what is going on
It has party room in the rear
The room has a few large tables
Good for group dining
Every sushi ordered here is half price
However you have to exceed $7 per person
I only recommend getting the house special rolls which taste better than your regular rolls
It's a great deal for eating okay quality sushi for such CHEAP price
Two people can come out stuff with less than 17 for a bill
If you're looking for a place that has decent sushi, but won't gouge your pockets
you might enjoy Sushi Park
The low-key atmosphere is nice when you just want to hang out with a couple of friends and catch up
The restaurant can accomodate larger groups in the back
They have a good selection of rolls for those who aren't accustomed to just eating sashimi
The Scorpion Roll was pretty tasty, as was the Manhattan Roll
If you're not looking for a fancy sushi restaurant, but have a craving for sushi, Sushi Park wouldn't be a bad bet
Wonderful dining experience
The staff are so nice and well versed in everything
Quite helpful and not snotty
Great atmoshpere
This place is a great late night nook
I had my best first kiss there
it was very intimate
Great little date spot
Hidden gem
Identity crisis gone right
Ostensibly a Tikki bar/lounge, one is more likely to end up drinking Presidente than Scorpion Bowls
The jukebox doesn't exactly promise a trip to the islands, but the mini dance floor and semi-private alcove in the back beg to be taken advantage of
If it were located anywhere other than the northern end of the last truly seedy strip of bars in Manhattan, it would be overrun with hipsters
As is, enjoy
For a quick lunch the sandwiches, burgers, and salads are fine
For more exensive fare the bisque, seafood and pasta are great
Waterstone Grill is one of the more attractive and comfortable restaurants in the Fin'l District south of Wall St
Whenever I've eaten there, the food has been tremendous and the specials are fantastic
I highly recommend any of the seafood dishes
As an after-work drinks place, the place is really cool with excellent bar food
The wait staff is courteous and efficient and the outdoor cafe out back on Stone St is worth the wait
I take colleagues from work or have friends meet me there whenever I can
There are times when there is a long wait at lunch so be safe and make a reservation
Called in an order for delivery
Waited 45 minutes
Called to confirm
Waited another 20
Called to cancel
No explanation or apology given
The restaurant is less than 2 blocks from the office
Don't order by phone if you want your food and expect it in any timely way
I took some business guests to Waterstone and was embarrased by a very noisy place which served mediocre food
The waitress was nice and tried hard to please
Too bad she didn't cook the meal, as the chef overcooked my chicken to near-rubber consistency
All 5 of us were disappointed
Have gone to Waterstone three times and was never disappointed
I've eaten the mushroom risotto, caesar salad, lobster tart, soup and wraps
All excellent!
My girlfriend and I moved to Staten Island a few months ago and discovered American Grill right around the corner
We've made it a point of going once every few weeks since
The ambience first the name perfectly
Heavy wood tables and chairs are spaciously arranged in a deep wooden room with red curtains
The place is equally comfortable for a sunny family brunch or a romantic, noirish date on a rainy night
The attentive servers  help facilitate either situation  The food is hearty and delicious
Red meat is best represented on the entrees, and my girlfriend has enjoyed the lamp chops and the chicken pot pie, among other dishes
But I'm a vegetarian, and I keep returning despite the fact that none of their entrees meet my dietary requirements
The reason? Rich appetizers (baked fontina, lentil cake, french onion soup) and ample, tasty salads
the food there was fresh
fresh fruit, homemade soups and salads
the people are nice and the service is quick
My fiance and I went saturday nite and had a wonderful time! We went to their location in Manhattan years ago and were very happy to see them reopen
Chef sal is a great person and a wonderful host
We will be back again and again!!!
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it! The waiters were very professional, courteous and attentive
The food presentation and taste was fabulous! If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often
It's perfect for a romantic date or intimate evening with close friends
THIS IS A PLACE YOU MUST VISIT MORE THAN ONCE TO TRY THEIR BILL OF FARE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND I AM PARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT I EAT
I just ate here for the first time tonight with my wife and four-year old son and felt compelled to write this review
Everything we had from the scallop starter to the rare ribeye, right through dessert was impeccible
Service was just as good as the food, and the courses were perfectly timed
Danny, the owner has done his homework
What more could one ask for

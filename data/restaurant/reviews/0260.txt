This was our first time dining there and I cannot say enough about this restaurant
The food is out of this world, and the staff are so so so nice
Absolutly delightful!!
there are very few restaurants in the city that gives you such a great package
We live near by and we bring our friends and family there on a regular basis
The food, service, and ambience are the key factor to a great restaurant
And Fleur de Sel has them all
They have the formula down
Great! Great! Great! This is a restaurant group that will go very far
Thank you for always giving us such great meals
Compared to other restaurants in its class, we were very disappointed: it was very expensive, there was inattentive/not so snappy service (the waiter didn't describe the food, it was are you ready?), the food was tasty yet somewhat bland, the presentation was blah, and the portions left you hungry when you left - You come in hungry, you leave hungry All in all there wasn't much to show for what we had paid
Instead, we'd recommend Eleven Madison Park or La Metairie
wife took me for our anniversary - chef renaud caught wind of this took care of us personally
the appeteasers, entrees desserts were all so tempting we could have ate it all (if not for our budget)
a free glass of wine dessert was a nice touch
the foie gras the lamb/seafood dishes were out of this galaxy! too bad some reviewers could not appreciate this laid back primo spot, but there are enough of us who do!
Incredible dinner
eat here
you will be completely amazed
the food is outstanding
the service is impeccable
Every dish that we had from the tasting menu was better and better
There is no room for mistakes in New York, and this restaurant seems to know what they are doing
A little loud at times
but the mood and ambience is perfect
Crains magazine was right
Unbelievably good food and the service was outstanding
One of the best intimate dining experiences in New York
I have eaten here several times in the past for lunch and have always felt that they have offered an excellent value, for the quality of food and service they provide
This past week I came in on Monday and thoroughly enjoyed their dinner tasting menu for the first time
In addition to the sublime food they served, we enjoyed their choices of wine on their special (1/2 price) menu
I highly recommend anyone to come in and enjoy a special evening with an attentive staff and talented chef!
Do not listen to the reviews on this list except mine
For the same price, better food, larger portions and amazing ambience, go to Bouley in Tribeca
Fleur was loud like a cafeteria, tight and bustly, food portions were ridiculously small (i mean they were like appetizers), the prices were the same if not more $ than a top rated restaurant like Bouley, AND they dont give you a wine list
Each glass of wine was $16
00
After dinner, the bill for 2 came out to 210 tip included
RIDICULOUS
What a treat it is to dine at a restaurant where your service cares
The dishes that comes out, perfection, beautifully crafted, ingeneous
Lillet gravlax!! Wow!! people you need to try this place
Perfect wines pairing by a staff that is well trained
My waiter even told me that Mondays are half off on certain wines! I've lived here too long to have just discovered this place
The food, the service deserves more than what I've seen Zagats has given them
They are top of the line!
we are in love with this nice quaint french eatery
I agree the foie gras ny grown was excellent
selections inventive tasty
desserts are sinful
this is one of the best french spots in nyc
What a treat!! Being a New Yorker for over 25 years, this is truly a rare find
From wonderful service to inventive cuisine, to extensive wines in a cozy setting, what more can you ask for! This has become my weekly experience and each time I'm there it seems that many diners there agree with me
Whether it's a special occasion or a weekly one like mine, they will make it a very memorable experience and well worth it

Order the goat cheese raviolis
This may have been one of the finest dinners we've ever had
My fiance and I had the six course tasting
Wow! the oysters and gelee were amazing
The heirloom and cantaloup salad, so inventive
The goatcheese ravioli, something I've never had before
It was out of this world
Every course was perfect, and the bottle of Chassagne-Montrachet that we had with the courses fit perfectly
Thank you to our waitress for a perfectly run dinner! Thank you!! Thank you!!!
My husband and I came here for a 4-course vegetarian tasting on his birthday
the food was wonderful, as was the wine
the service, however, was incomparable
We were treated to 5 courses instead of 4, plus an extra dessert for the birthday boy
what not to recommend? The chef/owner came out to greet patrons, which I always think is a lovely touch
I highly recommend Fleur de Sel, whether or not you have a special occasion
i'm not a big french food kinda guy but this place is great
clean, comfortable, and cozy this restaurant has delicious food
my date and i got the tasting menu and everything was flavorful and fresh
oysters with mint gelee, fish with peas, tender lamb with vegetables, and of course spectacular desserts
to be honest i didn't notice the fleur de sel, but everything tasted great, i like the way the chef used fresh vegetables to really lighten things up
service was nice without being overbearing
the wine steward was nice he offered a coupon for free caviar and champage for my next visit
We saw a feature on this restaurant on Food Network, so we put it on our list of restaurants to go to in New York
We were greeted by the chef/owner, Cyril Renaud, upon arrival
The ambiance was great
We had a prix fixe dinner for $65 per person (six courses)
We had excellent service from arrival
The halibut was the best
The raspberries with caramel ganache was the best dessert I've ever tasted
Cyril said good-bye to us when we left
Everything was great
My friend and I took our young teenage daughters to New York City for a long awaited trip, and had an experience to remember at Fleur de Sel on a slow Sunday evening
Because our daughters weren't sure what to order, and were a little intimidated at the surroundings (notwithstanding the beautiful simplicity of the decor), they ordered only appetizers while their fathers ordered dinner
Chef-owner Cyril Renaud got curious and came out to take a look
One thing led to another, as we were served four complimentary appetizers and four complimentary desserts--all of which were exquisite
Mr
Renaud visited with us and treated our daughters like queens, as did the wait staff, making our evening at Fleur de Sel a treasured memory
We would go back in a New York minute
Very nice experience
The food was surprisingly Perfect place to take your dream date! Though it is a small place, you can have a private conversation with complete ease
I was there for about three hours, but felt like an hour
I like to dine at different place every time I go out, but if I have to, I would surly not mind eating here again
We had the winter tasting menu on Christmas Eve, and it was one of the most well thought-out, well-executed, memorable meals I've ever had
The setting is informally beautiful and the service was knowledgable, accomodating, and quick

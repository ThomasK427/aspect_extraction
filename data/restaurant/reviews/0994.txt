Stepping into the restaurant is like enter a Japanese temple, with all the flair and energy of a downtown NY hotspot
Delicious drinks, huge sake and wine selection, and the most lovely service in the city
They were out of many menu items
Only the waiter did not bother to tell us until 45 minutes after we had ordered and made substitutions without telling us
Half the items we ordered never arrived
They have a lot of improvement to get everything running smoothly
Don't count on quick, efficient service
Most of the food was pretty tasty, but this is no Nobu
Overall, not worth the money
This is the ultimate in Japanese cuisine! From the decor to the menu it is the most impressive restaurant I have ever had the pleasure to dine in
If you have been to Nobu, Danielle, or the likes
Megu will surely put a smile on your face- as it is in the same category
I wouldn't be surprised if it is rated the best restaurant in NYC for 2004 and beyond
We made reservations for 6 and we specifically said we wanted a quiet table
Yet the maitre d still sat us next to the bar
We asked for a quieter table but he said he couldn't do it even though the restaurant was half empty
The place was very loud
From a recommenation from my local spa, Acqua Santa Spa, I eat at Il Sogno
Bravo to the Owners, Jimmy and Luana
I have travelled extensively within the boarders of Italy an d I must say that this restaurant is just outstanding when it comes to Italian dishes, Molto Buono
I have gone to this place for the last 6-months and the food remains great and the service is also outstanding
Now I wait for spring so I can eat al fresco (outside)
Now owner I just ask Jimmy or his right hand man, AJ for the specials or their suggestions for my dinner
Molto Glazie Il Sogono
When I moved from the Village to midtown and found Acqua Santa Spa, the owner of Acqua Santa Spa highly recommended this true and authentic Italian eatery
The owner and staff are gracious, helpful and make me laugh with their wit and humor
The food is outstanding and the bar and wine list are outstanding
I have reccommended this establishment to my friends
This small tucked away spot is how I like is because as of now you can get tables pretty easy, as soon as everyone hears about this place I will not be able to get a table anymore and my special place for great food and drinks will be just another see and be seen places
This is the perfect spot that is tucked away in midtown, and has a beautiful outdoor patio which can hold up to about 200 people
It's great for parties and special events
The food is exceptional, and the service is remarkable
They have a fanominal wine list
Fancy dining without the pretentiousness of most of the restaurants in midtown
I drove in from Long Island and found parking easily right by the restaurant
The hostess is fabulous and promptly directed me and my family to a table
The waiter I had was extremely attentive
The food was scrumptious and uncomparable
I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and this is the only one that offers an italian-esque ambiance and quality food
I felt like I was in villa roma eating grandma's meal
I have no complaints about the food or service at this charming Italian find in the midst of midtown
We sampled the daily specials including the garlic shrimp appetizer and the bass on a bed of mushrooms
Both great
Service, however, was bizarre
At first we had one waiter, then another appeared after we almost passed out for hunger while holding our menus closed
A third waiter refreshed our drinks
When I ordered my cocktail, I told him 3 times what I wanted and he still came back with the wrong thing
I still have no idea who was really our waiter
At the end of the night we were given free refills of wine, which I thought was a nice gesture
That saved them in my opinion
The food is fresh/excellent, the service friendly/knnowledgable and this rare gem is tucked away in midtown
This quaint neighborhood place is my favorite Italin restaurant in the city and I feel selfish for not sharing it with others sooner
Spring through the Fall, the patio is a wonderful attraction
Add a date or friends and a bottle (or a few bottles with the resonable prices) of wine and you've got a great evening ahead
For those who want glits, this is not restaurant is not for you, but if you want to feel warm and happy give it a try
Il Sogno means The Dream, and this family-owned restaurant really earns its name
Exquisite, authentic Northern Italian food with a light delicate touch; specialties: whole fish baked in sea salt, fileted at table;home-made pastas
Great service and a large outdoor patio make it a terrific summer place
Fantastic wines in all price ranges
Cosy restaurant where you could easily spend the whole afternnon
Delicious food and friendly staff
Grab a sandwich and a good book and settle in
I have been to Wild Ginger many times this year after discovering it when my friend moved to Murray Hill
Everytime I go, the food is delicious, the portions are huge and the people are nice
The best part is, you never have to wait for a table and the bill is very reasonable
The free cucumber appetizer that they give you is really good as well
I have had sushi, noodle dishes, dumplings, chicken stir fry and grilled fish and haven't been disappointed yet!
the food here is just AMAZING
seared tuna around soba noodles
huge portion, great taste and WHAT A VALUE!!! sushi that melts in your mouth, great stir frys and great appetizers
went with a bunch of friends for my bday, and everyone LOVED their food
wine was great (good list and reasonable prices), cocktails were good but STRONG
go there and you'll LOVE it, i guarantee it
This restaurant was relatively new when my company hosted its Christmas party there
The food was outstanding! We had the Vietnamese Salad, an assortment of appetizers, and I had a sesame salmon type entree
The coconut sorbet was delicious
The atmosphere is nice, the service is very good
They have a pretty sushi bar and nice bathrooms, too! I would highly recommend this place
The food was great, the staff was beyond great
It was a bit more expensive than I thought, but still worth a try for anyone that likes asian fusion
My boyfriend and I ventured across the Brooklyn bridge for a weekend getaway from Manhattan
Deterred by the prices at River Cafe and the lines at Grimaldi's, we stumbled upon Balzar
What a find! A great $20 price fixe with lamb to die for, great service and wonderful frozen drinks
Worth a trip over the bridge!
The Scene From the engaging and frank wine service to the homemade truffles that arrive at the end of your meal (personally delivered by the pastry chef, no less), service is strikingly deft for such a casual, comfortable restaurant
The two dining rooms, decorated with wooden tables and chairs and surrounded by exposed brick, are flush with good energy and conversation
The Food Chef Marco Canora's cooking has an unusual clarity and restraint
Raw snapper could easily be overwhelmed by rosemary and lemon; in his hands, the combination is ethereal
Celery leaves would be decorative elsewhere; here, they're used to freshen a dish of red wine-braised octopus
Entrees range from excellent (braised veal with savory roasted sweetbreads) to very good (luscious monkfish osso buco)
The milk chocolate and pecan tarts--both superb--are bested by the peanut brittle and sweet potato ice creams with which they're served
While the decor is fairly simple the wine list and food are spectacular
I didn't understand the previous reviews that complained about food quality or service issues as I have enjoyed two wonderful meals here
Both times knowledgeable servers walked us through an interesting and enjoyable wine list that my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed
The food is absolutely amazing - the gnocchi is the best I have ever had, the duck ravioli is amazing and I loved the lamb cooked three ways
Compared to New York prices, the menu seems reasonably priced (it is not cheap like Fridays, but is reasonable compared to top quality food experiences in this city)
I am now a big fan of this place and will bring many of my business dinners here - I just wish it was located in midtown!
A spontaneous date at Heath afforded a number of suprises with pure and vibrant food combinatons, jewel-like wines and a truly hospitable atmosphere
While this was a rather brief dinner, I can't wait to return as everything was truly right on target
Bravo!

This place was great
The owners and every one there was very accommodating, friendly and attentive
Had a private party that night, so not much selection of food
But will definitely go back and try some of their more authentic Basque cuisine
The food was great, great atmosphere
we stopped in for a little pre-party meal and we loved everything about the place
Cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and tasty dishes
Better yet, it was a smoker-friendly place, which is very difficult to find these days
We were a group of 16 for a surprise party, were seated, and had to wait for the birthday girl
Well, no one gave us a hard time about ordering
In fact, we had to flag the waiter down because we were getting very hungry and wanted to get started
After reading that this was a smoking restaurant, I was a bit worried since I'm not a smoker
I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't even smell any smoke
Overall, the food and service were decent
My husband made friends with the Italian speaking waiter and the guy took good care of us
The portions were pretty small for the price, I thought, and I never got the coffee I ordered
Don't know if we were charged for it
Since the company took priority over the food, I really enjoyed myself
The restaurant itself seemed pleasant and cozy
Excellent service, delicious menu, adorable European crowd, beautiful, eclectic atmosphere
Highly recommend for dinner, but if you are not in the mood to eat, Euzkadi is perfect for an array of aromatic wines and complimenting cheeses
Can dress up or down, does not matter
Euzkadi just wants you to enjoy yourself and your company
This restaurant has a quant feel yet at the same time embodies so much character
With the sincerity of the employees, the superior fare, and the providing of your own pleasant company, Euzkadi is one of the many reasons why I LOVE NY!
The food was amazing
Reminded me of dinners I've had in San Sebastian
The roast hake and seafood stew were wonderful
Staff was friendly
has nothing to do with real basque food,just creative food trying to steal a spanish identity for marketing purposes, go to Sala on bowery is a much better bet
Euzkadi was a plesant surprise
The food overall was quite good
The Calimari appetizer was great and should be converted into an entree
The wine selection was good enough for all palletes and moderately priced
Before going I had read a few reviews that panned the service
Knowing this I treated our waiter with respect and he returned in kind - I've worked in restaurants before and can tell you that a kind greeting can go far
This place is definitely worth a visit
BTW - If smoke bothers you, then make sure you are seated outside
I love Euzkadi
So nice to have some new options other than the usual Italian, French bistro stuff
The duck is one of my favorite dishes, and the appetizers are all good
Friendly staff, great atmosphere
A little pricey, but definitely good for it
The Scene Like its big sister, L'Express, the style is classically Parisian, with antique theater posters, woven cafe chairs and tin ceilings
With snazzy entrances from the street and the Days Inn lobby next door, it attracts tourists and roving New Yorkers alike; both theatergoers and an after-club crowd gravitate to its all-night kitchen
The Food Brasserie favorites are prepared by the book: Onion soup gratinee bubbles with a thick layer of Gruyere cheese, and grilled shell steak is served medium-rare, with a side of crisp shoestring potatoes
More inventive entrees, such as the salmon tournedos rolled with scallion slices, are beautifully assembled, but lack seasoning
For a snack, try the warm goat cheese Provencale served with tomato on a lightly sweetened honey crouton, or go for the molten chocolate cake
When visiting New York, I went to Pigalle and at it wasn't bad, but I have had better
For dinner, I ordered a dish that did not say it had mushrooms in it, but it had mushrooms, which ruined my dinner
Nonetheless, the service was fantastic
My girlfriend loved it and she wanted to go back for breakfast
Their breakfast was quite delicious, but needed some seasoning
In fact, both meals were pretty bland until I used the salt and pepper to enhance the flavor
If it is close by where you stay, it isn't a bad decision, but don't go out of your way
On a trip to NY around new years, stayed at the Days Inn
Decided to try Pigalle and we loved it! Ate there several times during our stay and were never disappointed
The food drinks were great
The service could've been better, but most times it was super crowded
It was definitely a great find
I've been going here for the last year, because i live in the neighborhood
The last few times I've been here, it's been really inconsistent
On my latest trip, I was sitting at the bar and the bartender brought me my burger with Cheddar and not Brie; like i ordered
When I pointed it out, he told me that I said cheddar, (I hate cheddar) then hastily took the burger back without any apologies
When I finally got hte burger back, it was cold
Both bartenders were just flat out rude
I'd say service is real hit or miss
They do have a real good burger though, if the server can get it right
My husband and I have a tradition of eating at the Brasserie Pigalle late on Thanksgiving night after arriving in New York via train
I am a French teacher and have been to France numerous times
This year, I read review after review and almost didn't go to Pigalle
We walked from our hotel on Lexington Ave
and arrived cold and winded
Our waiter appeared IMMEDIATELY and confirmed the fact we ate there every Thanksgiving night
I had the escargots
the bed of spinach is a great touch
My husband had the salade Nicoise and soupe a l'oignon gratinee
All the food was hot, tasty and well worth the year-long wait
I have the feeling I am less discerning than all your other reviewers????? I say go and try this delightful brasserie
it's a little bit of France in New York
I recently moved close to Pigalle, and I figured I'd try it for Sunday brunch
What a disappointment! I ordered a Spanish frittata that was supposed to have chorizo sausage
After eating half of it, there was no sign of chorizo, or any other sausage
I called it to the waiter's attention, and, after offering a side order of sausage (which I declined), he said he'd take it off the check
Of course they didn't take it off the check
When I reminded him, he came back with my manager said he could take 10% off, that's it
I felt like I was wheeling and dealing at an unfriendly car dealer's
They even had the nerve to include a full tip in the check
How incredibly short-sighted of them, as I'm never going back and I could have been a regular, if only because I live so close
I really love this little gem of a restaurant
It isn't super-fancy, but you can get great food in a comfortable French country setting
Great wines, tasty food, fun atmosphere - I have fallen in love with Pigalle
We have never eaten dinner at Pigalli, but have had breakfast and lunch
The salads were like those we were served in Paris, and the Eggs Benedict were out of this world
We will definitely eat there again and have recommended the restaurant to friends
though the outside of the restaurant looks great, the actual food is horrible
we had a big party so we got to try many things on the menu
They ran out of escargot which was disappointing
the pate was dry and tasted as if it was out of a can
the fried calamari was a very small portion

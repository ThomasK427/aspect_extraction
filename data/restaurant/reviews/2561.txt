There are much better places to go all over the city than this tourist trap that has gone downhill over the years! Good if you have alot of people to feed because of big portions but the food has gotten bland, the service rude and just not worth the wait when they are busy! Check on citysearch for much better places!
We dined at Carmines Post-show
We waited 20 mins for a table in the pleasant bar area
Once seated we were greeted by a very rude waiter who threw menus at us and then snatched them away as we were ordering
Food portions are huge fine if everyone wants to eat the same thing - but not much good otherwise or if only 2 of you
All the food arrived luke-warm and tasted bland
We couldn't get out of there fast enough
Can't recommend strongly enough NOT to go there!
There is nothing Italian about the food
Tomato sauce that has barely been cooked and tastes more like ketchup than anything else
Huge portions that would never be found in Italy
Slathered garlic--a profound lack of salt--overcooked pasta
There is nothing of the simplicity or elegance of Italian cooking
This is, at best, very mediocre Italo-American food--not any better than the Olive Garden and more money
For a bad meal, go here
For Italian food, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else
Carmines has good Americanized Italian food (ie, don't go there if you're looking for authentic - go to The Original Vincent's in Little Italy if you want GREAT Italian food!!!) and the portions are large enough to feed a family of four, or a couple with lots left over
The place is always crowded and even at 10:30 you'll have to wait for a table
If you've ever been to Maggianos (another Italian chain) or Bucca di Beppo, Carmine's is very similar in both atmosphere and food
Go once to say you've been there, then head to Little Italy for the real thing
I'm a native new yorker and have gone to many great Italian restaurants throughout the city, but this was NOT one of them! Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait 40 minutes to get seated
Then waited another 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order
After I placed my order, the waiter turned to my boyfriend made a joke about not having pork fried rice
My boyfriend is chinese and it was completely uncalled for! Then while ordering wine, the waiter kept trying to correct my boyfriend's Italian even though he is FLUENT in Italian! It took 45 minutes for them to bring out our food which was bland and barely warm! Plus,t they kept rushing us
Needless to say, I did NOT leave a tip! Not one cent
If you want great service, good food, a friendly environment, and respect--go to Little Italy
Good Value, and quality food
The bread was out of this world
The four pasta entree should not be missed
My wife and I tried to make reservations at 5:30 as we had a 8:00 show to attend just a few doors down at the St
James
We were told that there were no tables available at that time but to come in at 5:45 and they would see what they could do
We showed up at the restaurant and were rudely told that they could not guarantee us a table before 8:00
We left and walked down to Sardi's and had a wonderful experience
Do yourself a favor
Skip Carmine's and go to Sardi's
My one complaint about Carmine's is the host/hostess staff
At times they have been rude, pushy and quite inhospitable! Being polite and treating people with respect is always key in a business and this group needs practice
Once seated, Carmine's is a lot fun
If you have 6 or more people this is the best place in NYC to be
Huge family style portions that aren't large just to compensate for lack of taste! Everything is great
Sunday's special is Four Pastas and worth a trip on it's own
If you have a small party, be careful, you will be eating leftovers for days
Drinks are also huge
Biggest drawback is the HUGE wait times
They'll seat you w/o a rez, but it may take 2 hours on a Fri/Sat
Get a rez and book plenty in advance
We were a party of 3 at Carmine's on a Monday night
The reservationists were nothing but rude
After waiting 30 minutes we were told there were still 8 parties ahead of us
We decided to eat at the bar and when we asked for menus, the bartender told us to look on the walls
While standing to the side reading the menu, the same nasty receptionist told us we couldn't do that
How were we supposed to see the choices? I don't care if the food is great; it certainly couldn't make up for the horrible service!
the portions are huge - for a new yorker its worth every bang for your buck! long wait but well worth it
make reservations! stuffed after our entrees but the cheesecake is to die for!!!
Stopped in a few times always hoping to find out what all the love is about with this place,the place itself is fine,comfortable actually, but the food just isnt good
Everything I have had just tasted like salt-not garlic,not cheese,salt-only thing i can figure is that since they churn it out in such quantity the quality's gotta suffer, wouldnt go back unless dragged or for a drink
Great quality eats here
Portions are enormous so be prepared to share
The bar is top notch as well
Not some fly by night bartender who just stopped working at the local dive
Desserts are delicious
Seating can be real tough
Don't rule out sitting at the bar and eating there
Much quicker
Tourists to NYC for the first time, we were told we had to go to Carmines
The hostesses and waitstaff were very rude and seemed to care less if you were there or not
They didn't bother to tell us the entree's were large enough for 4 people to share, we ended up ordering too much food
We LOVED the food but were aggravated the waitress did not warn us of how much food we had ordered
Priced appropriately for the portions
If we go to NYC again, we will definitely go back!
I have been going to Camine's Midtown for a few years now
I am a native New Yorker and although this place is mobbed with tourists it's charm and fun cannot be denied
If you want the best southern Italian food around this is the place to go
Not only is it the best tasting food but it's very inexpensive compared to any othe restaurant in the city
This place is great for groups since it's family style but my boyfriend go by ourselves all the timeand take the leftovers home
They will not take reservations for two but we've never had to wait more then an hour and in the meantime a few drinks at the bar never hurts!
Carmine's is one of the best restaurants i have ever been to
It is great for families and the portions are huge
It is a great place to go to before a show
The food its good but the amount can be a total turnoff
Also, its incredibly noisy so don't expect and kind of romantic moments
If your a truckdriver you will get your moneys worth
This is an Italian staple in Midtown
The food is good, the portions are absolutely ridiculous and the crowd is pretty varied
There is usually a long line no matter when you go
The menu is pretty basic, nothing too fancy
I would recommend for a pre-theater dinner (most shows are around the corner)
Also, I would suggest going with a big crowd, just because the amount of food you get would be difficultly consumed by a couple
great food,and alot of it
Not a good place for dinner for two
Service was great even at our late hour
i feel that the overall quality of the food outways the cons of the restuarant, although you may have to wait a long time you can walk around the city while you wait
When we arrived at Carmine's at 6:00 pm the host told us that it would be a 2-2 1/2 hour wait for a party of twelve
When we got back to the restaurant around 8:30 pm the host told us that our table would be ready in another 30 minutes
While waiting in the restaurant we were yelled at numerous times to move, pushed, and shoved by the wait staff
They called our table around 9:15 pm and told us that they could only seat ten at a table and they had no idea when the party of two would be seated
The host stated that they do not seat parties larger than ten
The manager rudely informed us that it is just pasta and we should not be upset
This was our experience at Carmine's and we will make sure that other people know that it is just pasta

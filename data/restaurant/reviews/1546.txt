Good desserts too!
It's got seats, food and waiters
The food is okay and the price is reasonable
Nothing really stands out about this place
I would put this on your back up list in case there aren't seats somewhere else
A bit rushed
but overall really good Dim Sum
Subtitles on the carts are a plus
OVerall the wait staff is very friendly and helpful
The Scene Much as its name implies, this quirky Lower East Side eatery evokes a village
The sylvan interior features a wooden hut, fake trees, a canopy of leafy greens, and a large mural of a sun-dappled mountainside
A small juice bar, where employees grind slushy fruit drinks, sits near the entrance
Service is rapid-fire and businesslike
The Food Thick bowls of congee, the rib-sticking rice porridge, are the main attraction
The 27 varieties cover everything from chicken and black mushroom to sliced fish and preserved egg
Cantonese-style casseroles and rice noodle dishes round out the offerings
I went here with a group of 10 on a Friday night
We were able to get a reservation on short notice, and they did seat us pretty quickly
The rest of the dinner was so bad, it turned out to be hilarious
Food was terrible, drinks were terrible, service was terrible
The decor was nasty-- I couldn't look around without loosing my appetite
The seating was completely uncomfortable
There were kids EVERYWHERE, yelling, running around
Just when we didn't think the experience could get any worse, something completely unappetizing would happen
It was so ridiculous, we were almost crying, we were laughing so hard
Thank goodness we only had to pay $20 per person, or we would have rioted
Please, PLEASE trust me: this place is a nightmare
After hearing great things about this place, I planned a dinner here with 8 of my friends on a Saturday night
I made a reservation and didn't have to wait long to be seated
I have to say this was one of the best group dinner experiences I've had in NY
Our waitress didn't speak much english so ordering was a bit confusing, but not impossible and it actually added to the charm
The low prices led to us ordering way too much food which we all enjoyed
The drinks are very cheap which is a nice treat
At the end of the meal you get watermelon - a nice surprise and change from the oranges you usually get at other restaurants
We had a great time, ate until we were stuffed and our total bill came out to $20/person with tip
We'll definitely be going back and trying out one of their karaoke rooms
We went this past Saturday and it was a bad experience
The wait staff was terrible
The mushroom and chicken congee were watered down and tasteless
White rice were very sticky and too moist
We asked the waiter to change the unacceptable ones but he muttered and said that he's going to change them and after he does, don't ask to change it again
We had a flounder fish that was fillet into balls but there were fish bones
Kitchen staff was not careful enough
Walnut shrimp was not worth the money
Few pieces of shrimp, unthoroughly cooked
Clam with black bean sauce was bland
As if they just slap on some soy sauce
Fruit or sweet dessert soup were missing
We did not get either one
But we did get a waitress who stood behind me and looked over my shoulder when I was reviewing the bill
We stumbled upon this place and new CitySearch highly recommended it, plus the wait was 30 mins and the place was packed! DON'T BE FOOLED! There is little to no service, and when you get service they are rude
The food took forever and when I got mine it was cold! Save your time and money, don't go here
For tasty selections, value a fun atmoshphere, one can not go wrong coming here
A little cheaper than in c-town but parking is terrible
Sat in village type room seating 8 of us
The selections quite varied, the beef chow fun, vegetable dishes their jook (congee/porridge) were all very good
My kids picky as they are actually ate a lot behaved also which made dinner more pleasant
Cocktails were ok, not so good with chinese food so hot tea was fine for us
I personally have come back for pick up, saving 50 cents or a dollar is no big deal but when you get tasty food, then saving money is a bonus
Congee village is a great place for some super yummy Chinese food with a large group of friends
everything is served family style
The prices are incredibly cheap
When I went with a group of 6 people we stuffed ourselves and still only ended up paying $15 each
There are alot of different dishes
I recommend the seafood rice dish served in a bamboo bowl and, of course, try any of the congee dishes
they are warm and delicious
The decorations in this restaurant make you feel like you're in a jungle
not spectacular, but a fun, busy place to eat with friends
The only real downside is that we had to wait an hour for our table
It might be better to come alittle earlier than dinner time if you want to get a table quickly
Still, you can get drinks at the bar while you're waiting
Happy eating~!
We often eat in Chinatown and this place has horrible staff
Despite reservations, we ended up waiting for 1hr+
No one came to take our order for another 20 min
We wrote the order down ourselves, using menu numbers
They rejected our written order and forced us to read the order out without the numbers
Then we asked if we could refridgerate my birthday cake
The waitress pointed at a shelf and told us to put it there
My friend said that that was not a fridge
The staffer barked for us to put it there
Whenever we asked for anything (soya), they ignored us
Later, the waitress tore the cake boxes apart (making it impossible to take the leftover cake home)
It was a terrible experience and I will never return to Congee Village
The food was below average
Many many competitors offer a superior product and service
This is a place where you can go and eat
The food was quite excellent, very tasty, and light on the stomach
The service was excellent
The waiting time was excellent
You can't go wrong with this restaurant
The decor of the restaurant makes you feel like you are in China
If you look under the big round tables there is light and in the center of it are rocks and blue and green shiny pebbles or some kind of decor
It is quite elegant
The food is spectacular and cheap, and the atmosphere is wonderfully weird
The service is totally brusque and intrusive, but it doesn't matter at all
This place send me into a hazy dream state of total deliciousness
Get the (cheap as hell) drinks and be prepared for greatness
Best dishes: squid with salt pepper, vegetable congee, chinese salted pancake
My boyfriend and I were new to NewYork and we just came across this restaurant

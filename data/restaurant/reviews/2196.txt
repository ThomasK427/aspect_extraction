The prices are high but worth it
My son and I dined at Keens for the first time on January 31, 2006 and we were quite impressed with the steaks
The atmosphere is definitely Old New York and the clay pipes on the ceiling are amazing
Our double porterhouse was huge and cooked perfectly, with the right amount of marbleing and great beefy flavor
The side of hash browns was good, but small portioned
Excellent salad and cold, briny oysters made for a memorable meal
The bar is great and there are over 200 Single Malt scotches to choose from plus very knowledgable bartenders
The staff is friendly but our waiter was only so-so
All in all, this is one of the finest steakhouses in New York
Took a friend to Keens for his birthday, and have to say that this place is awesome!!! I ordered the Aged Prime New York Sirloin Steak and it was cooked to perfection
The Aged Prime Porterhouse for Two was also delicious
As an appetizer, I definitely recommend the Fresh Oysters on the Half Shell, as long as your not allergic
A little loud during peak hours, but calms down alittle after 9:00
Since I made the reservation at 8:00pm, the noise wasn't that much of an issue
Highly recommended and would definitely return again
I'm not a big fan of steakhouses (mostly because I don't like beef)
But if you are going to be a steakhouse, you should have class, history and offer amazing alternatives to your bovine entrees
Keens deliverd on all counts
they serve everyone warm fresh bread and a platter of crudites and olive platter that is filling and delicious
the filet is always perfect and the service is pretty good on the average
the shrimp cocktail was a bit rubbery the last time i had it but the wine list is always impressive
the lighting is so dim, it can easily be romantic although it seems the place is always filled with mostly businessmen
A great steakhouse - my husband went here last year for his bachelor party dinner and we had a celebratory group dinner here recently
Drinks, service and food are excellent - the filet mignon and sides are melt-in-your mouth delicious
The sole was very tasty but the grilled shrimp could've been better
Overall, outstanding steak in a cool, old New York atmosphere
Portions are generous, so be careful when ordering an appetizer! The mutton is HUGE and the steaks are thick and prepared to perfection! Don't forget to order a baked potato! Lobster and fish is fresh and delicious as well! There is also a fantastic wine list -- it'll take you about 25 minutes to go through that alone
Reservations are a must but midweek you can take your chances
The bar closer to 6th Ave is a bit of old New York and should not be missed -- either before or after dinner
The steak was average
I've had better
I sampled three side dishes
None of them were very good
The service was good
It's a good spot for kids
Overall, I would give the restaurant a C
One of only two restaurants in New York where you can get a prime sirloin steak
Roast beef also recommended
Popular and overcrowded in spite of the high prices
Make a reservation!
This is in my opinion, New York's best steakhouse
Over the past two years, I've tried every steakhouse in the city since it has the best steak, the most beautiful premises and the friendliest service
What more can you ask for if you hunger for a steak?
i chose keen's when we were visiting nyc to meet some friends for dinner and im the only one who didnt have a steak at a steakhouse
the oysters rockefeller were very good
and the ice berg lettuce with their blue cheese dressing was amazing
they even crumble chunks of blue cheese on top
they also have great bar!
The food was pretty typical steakhouse fare
Nothing too out of the ordinary
But, Oh! The scotch
The list was amazing, offering a variety for every taste imaginable
When you go (and you should) take a look at the pipes on the ceiling and on display
All the hype, and little more
Keens didn't live up to the hype I received prior to dining there
The food was average, or a bit higher
It does have an old school charm, and proximity to MSG, but little else
Not on my A list
We have been to Keen's on 3 different occasions while visiting New York and have never been disappointed
Each time it only gets better
The food, ambiance, and service have always been second to none
When we told them it was our anniversary, they went out of their way to make everthing special for us
The steaks are incredible!
Anyone who doesn't like this place is off their rocker! I have been there for family dinners, business dinners, bachelor parties (including my own), and nights out w/ the guys
The argument over the best steakhouses is an arbitrary one, but when you consider Keen's cost compared to
say
The Post House, it can't be beaten
Service is great
ambience is great (although maybe a bit geared to the male)
and anyone who is a fan of single malts will be overjoyed w/ their collection of well over 150 of them
The seafood tower is great for non-meat eaters
Old School
all business
and awesome
I've been here several times now, and have also experienced the other NYC steakhouses, such as Lugers, SW, Sparks, Del Friscos, Angelo Maxies, etc
Keens is the best! Porterhouse is the best! Great old world charm
Friendly service
Nice cozy bar
Make the reservation, you'll enjoy it
I loved it! Old time steakhouse
Great apps
Iceberg with blue cheese to die for,excellent oysters,tomato and onion
All the staples! Main course was great
Porterhouse for two,and my friend had the mutton chop which was out of this world
The service was expeditious,friendly and professional
Retired to the bar to have coffee and dessert and couldn't have been happier! Imagine my surprise when I a scotch lover stumbled on some 200 single malts
Heaven! Go!Go!Go!
Not our cup of tea! Not a pleasant dining experience
Nothing is wrong with older and more established restaraunts, but this does not rate in our book! Don't go - - - food was not very good and the prices were extremely high
The place is cool, has on old school steakhouse feel and a good bar area as well
The ambience is what drives the place
The food is decent, nothing that makes you beg for more though
I had the mutton, which is the place's specialty, and it was definitely not special, but definitely good
My friends steaks got a good response
The creamy spinach was too creamy
The service leaves alot to be desired
Its like our waitress was in a contest to see who could come to the table the least amount of times and get us out the door
The wine list is something that would be expected from a place that specializes in whiskey's and scotches
If my friend already had reservations, I wouldn't say don't go but I wouldn't make a point to recommend it to someone who was looking for a steak dinner either
Keens is only second to Peter Luger's for steak

it was all incredibly delicious!!! (especially the duck)My only complaint was the ridiculous waiter
He was really strange and made everyone uncomfortable whenever he came to the table (which was rarely)
He would just stand there, nodding his head and laughing, as if he was in on some inside joke on us all
He also blew the suprise that I had set up for my sister's bday
Went for an early V-Day dinner, only to be highly disappointed by the service
Our order should've been simple, a 5-course tasting menu
The first 3-courses were great and came out quickly
After that it was all downhill
The staff cleaned off our table presented us with dessert menus, skipping our 4th-course
After 30 minutes of flagging down our waitress figuring out the problem, we were served a 4th course
After that, it took another HOUR to serve dessert
It was comforting yet disturbing that the next table was having a similarly bad experience
After paying for our meal, we left some feedback with the manager (a chap named J
D
), who shared that we were the first to express concern about the service (??)
As good as the food is, it does NOT make up for the terrible level of service we received
We will not be back
Even though you enter the restaurant and immediately are taken aback by the interiors, the food was so bad that neither me nor my friends could eat the food
The management and the chef should really do something about it, otherwise it is tough to see how they can get repeat customers
I was told by a friend that Sapa was a new hot spot, so I decieded to give it a try
Big mistake
We had a reservation, yet we STILL had to wait 45 minutes for our table! Ok, so we got over that, but after we were seated we realized that our waiter had forgotten about us
We sat at our table menu-less, for 15 minutes until we said something
The menu was interesting at best and we were excited to try the Vietnamese rolls that are supposedly a popular choice, but those were little more than bland, fried, spring rolls
For an entree I had fish, which was nothing to write home about, and my boyfriend had the steak
That too was nothing special
My recommendation would be to save your money/time and eat elsewhere
I've only been tempted a handful of times to write a review and I eat out probably 4/7 days every week
We were seated about half an hour late; water came 10 minutes after seating; appetizers order was screwed up leaving us eating one last dish after everything else was served; waiter neglected my order of wine; my side order was also forgotten
In short, I am a terrific fan of cheap and quick and delicious food a la Chinatown, Washington Heights, Curry Row
but the lack of attention here was just so appalling
Also, re the food! Our main dishes arrived lukewarm
They were only subpar at best especially for the prices ($30ish per entree)
Really such a disappointment
Went on a Friday night and I must say, what a let down
First off, the bar was out of Kettle One by 8:30
Ok, no biggie, although not what you normally hear from a bartender in NYC on a Fri
night
The place is beautifully put together, but I must say the service and food lacked big time
The appetizer rolls were pretty good, and so were the french fries, but otherwise, save your money
The $31 Snapper and Prawns in Ginger was bland and way over priced
Tiny menu selection doesnt help either
The waiter was a scatter brain and disappeared the entire evening
All in all a poor dining experience
Too bad, but spend your money elsewhere
Trust me - you can do much better
this place is by far one of the best experiences we have had in a while
the decor is among the best in the city (check out the bathrooms!)
our server was outstanding
he made the experience so much more fun with his random knowledge of beer, food, and wine
the food was creative though we've had better
despite that, try the yellow fin tuna spring roll, it was out of this world
The most amazing experince I have ever had in a NYC restaurant
The food is outstanding, the service wonderful and the decor is to die for
Brilliantly done on all levels
Great secret so far! Food is excellent and the space is both striking and beautiful; very attentive and personlized service
And if the restaurant and bar areas were not attractive enough, check out the bathrooms downstairs
Highly recommend for drinks or dinner
Service was impeccable
Food was delicious and creative
Tuna with oxtail was spectacular
The rolls were fun and different
The space is great- only drawback is the acoustics- have to speak pretty loud
Top-notch service- my water glass was never empty! Owner and managers stopped at every table to ensure satisfaction
Definitely going to go back! p
s
- very cool bathrooms
Sapa is outstanding! Its uncommon and impeccable interior design lends itself to the excellent atmosphere that the attentive and diligent staff creates
The entire experience food, wine, service, aesthetic demonstrate an extreme attention to detail that should make this a nyc staple
I'll definitely be going back soon before I can't get in the door
What a vibe great atmosphere
Amazing can not say enough
From the fantastic food to the attentive service; this place was one of my best NYC dining experiences in months! The Cosmo/Mojito martini was awesome and the drink selection is unique and o'h soooo yummy!  Not once did I need to lift my head up to look for a server yet they knew when to let us relax
My water glass was filled, huge for me
Amazing!
I loved everything about this place, the atmosphere was absolutely amazing, the wait staff was friendly and prompt, the FOOD
WOW
try the oxtail and tomato appetizer, it literally melts in your mouth, for the main course the dry aged rib eye was delictable
The drinks were out of this world
I'm a person that eats out a lot and there are a lot of BAD restaurants in the city, it's refreshing to find something that is priced on par with other restaurants and exceed them in caliber
Definately worth it, go before it's discovered by the masses!
The Scene A glass facade, silver tableware, and blond wood seating lend a modern feel to this streamlined space
Homemade art--magenta canvases with fake flowers neatly pinned on in rows--adds a bit of whimsy to the walls
Servers struggle to explain the menu to those who can't tell an idli from a chapathi, but the mostly Indian clientele is completely at home with the vegetarian South Indian fare
The Food The plantain bajji, fried in lentil batter and served alongside rich sambar and coconut and mint chutneys, is love at first bite
To avoid repeated flavors, skip the potato bonda, round fritters served with the same trio of dips, and get your scoop of spicy mashed potatoes in the rava masala dosa, a crisp, netted crepe made of cream of wheat and rice
The South Indian thali offers rice, bread, and 12 little cups with big tastes, including a kuzhambu (curry), rasam (spicy soup), and pickle
The service ranges from mildly disagreeable to incredibly rude (waiter started yelling at me that I hadn't ordered an item when I asked about it)
And the food was small portions that were served in a tray that was reminiscent of a TV dinner, which would have been fine, but thats what it tasted like as well
Tinny tasting tomato sauce, small greasy parathas and baturas
The decor is quite nice, I'd recommend checking it out as you go to Chennai Gardens (27th and Lex)
The food is delicious, healthy, and very reasonably priced (downright cheap)
But the service is horrendous
The waiters seem distracted, they forget what you order, and they deliver each person's food at different times
The place can get extremely busy, and that only exacerbates the poor service
On the bright side, though, the worse the service, the less you have to tip! And the food is outstanding
While service tends to get a bit sloppy when they're full (eg
at lunch time on weekends), the food is authentic and very good
Try the Rasa-Vada, the rice dishes, the rava dosa - with without the masala, the tea and the madras coffee
All great stuff

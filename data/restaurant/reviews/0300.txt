Inside serves wonderful, fresh, sometimes innovative food
The staff is always so pleasant, and it is a good value
They also have some nice wine selections
If you go during the Garlic Festival, try the roast chicken with 40 cloves of garlic--they make the absolute best
I just wish more people would discover this great neighborhood restaurant
I've been going to Inside since they first opened and have seen the food go through some ups and downs but they seem to be on a roll now
They pared down the menu and the new concentration has resulted in some stunningly good dishes
The menu changes regularly, but if you see the short ribs, braised chicken thighs or Newport steak I'd jump on them
A recent side dish of grits and wild mushrooms was rich and delicious - just the thing for a cold winter night
The portobello mushrooms appetizer is light and refreshing but best split
Service has always been excellent and they have a small well chosen wine list (as well as $15/bottle corkage)
And if you're looking for a place where you can carry on a conversation then go there 6pm during the week when it's almost empty
Even later the noise level is moderate
We arrived at Inside expecting great things
What we found were very few diners, some slightly above average appetizers, and some extremely buttery entrees
I was shocked by the amount of butter used in the pork and lamb dishes -- the smell of butter was literally wafting off the plate! Inside wouldn't be my first choice for an evening out, but if you do go, be sure to try the dates wrapped in bacon -- they were delicious
I thought that the dinner that I had was GREAT!!!! This dinner was during Garlic Festival week
We had, Corn fritters with garlic aioli, savory custard with herbed hazelnuts, and a ribeye steak with garlic butter
I loved ever bite of my dinner
The owner made several visits to my table and was extremly gracious
My server did not miss a beat!
ok food
Reccomend the pomagranitini and pasta dishes, and overall thought the restaurant had a nice atmosphere, if a bit small, but avaoid sitting at tables by the door at all costs unless you want to feel like you are sitting outside in the freezing cold during your entire dinner - Inside packs the tables into their small space
With the vast selection of restaurants in this neighborhood, we saw no reason to return to Inside, where the food wasn't as interesting or well prepared as so many other places are in the West Village
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable
The place has changed hands many times and we preferred an earlier incarnation
Went back to Inside to have my favorite roast chicken with bread salad and we were startled to find Thursday night is Mexican food night
and it was THE BEST Mexican food we have ever had!!! The Tinga Tosatdos, tomales and carne with plantians and rice were wonderful but the pollo mole was AMAZING!!!! Call first to make sure they are having it but DON'T miss it! And $3 for a pork tomale??? Can't beat it
I loved the use of seasonal produce
With a resonably priced menu- no Appitizer over $10, no Entre over $20
Good overall experience except for when the bar bill came
an $11 martini is pure larceny
The Scene Paladar tries to create a south-of-the-border vibe with beautifully presented Pan-Latin cuisine, colorful decor and--somewhat incongruously--loud Middle Eastern music
The Food Things seem to be just as confused behind the kitchen door
Pork tamal is more soggy than moist (you don't want to eat it so much as pick it up and wring it out); salmon, although seared to perfection, is set adrift in a pea-green sea of bland tomatillo sauce; and juicy mahi-mahi is suffocated by a drab caper, olive and tomato sauce that bears an odd resemblance to puttanesca--which may be pushing the fusion envelope too far
Ironically, Paladar means "palate" or "taste" in Spanish
But most likely, it's the eyes, not the tastebuds, that will get the most satisfaction from a meal here
I came here with my family for a fun, spur of the moment meal on a Sunday night - it was busy but quiet so we had the back of the restaurant to ourselves
We ordered appetizers: both salads (the one with walnuts is amazing), mussels - perfectly fresh and spicy - ask for bread for dipping the delicious broth, fried calamari, ribs (fell off the bone, delish!), empanada - a little heavy and fried, and the piece de la resistance: shrimp and scallop ceviche, which was superb
I didn't have drinks, just Pinot Grigio, which was summery, light and delicious with everything
Sometimes casual and laid back is cool, but sometimes it is overdone or just an excuse for run down
The food is fine and not too expensive but their were no surprises or wows here anymore
If I lived really close I would have an occaisional meal but it is not a fun spot anymore
Intrigued by the ambience of the restaurant, some friends and I decided to have dinner at Paladar on Saturday night
The evening was a complete disappointment when our server could not provide us with any information about the wine list, could not tell the difference between pork and a filet, and gave us very poor service even though the restaurant was completely empty
When one of our orders was incorrect, the only compensation we received was a $3 reduction on the final bill that covered the difference in the cost of the entree ordered and the one that was actually brought out
Hey,  I think my description in the title describes best how I feel about this place
I went with my wife yesterday, and was surprised to get seated immediately without a reservation at 8:30 on a Friday
The service was slow, but that was something we wanted anyway, so it was fine with us
We ordered a quesadilla to start, which was really quite average
I got a whole fish special (was ok) and she got stuffed poblanos with beef which was pretty good
The ambience is lively and fun, and there were lots of groups there
Not a bad experience, but the food is average at best
I will not return, unless invited for a birthday party or something
The prices weren't bad though - dinner ended up at $80 with tip and we had a couple drinks as well
Food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable
The empanadas are the best in the city! Great place to start for drinks before heading out in the LES
I wanted to like this place - I got there 20 minutes before my friends, so I had plenty of time to take in the fun music, great decorations behind the bar, and tasty mojitos
but the food didn't live up to my expectations at all
I've had much better enchiladas
The table service was also slow
Upon walking in you we were greeted so friendly and the bartender was so helpful and attentive
We were just walking around the neighborhood and stumbled upon this little friendly and very warm place (both service and temperature wise!) Nice margaritas and nice place to get to know someone
Didn't get to see the entire joint because we were seated in the front bar area, which was great for my friends who were able to smoke
The service was good but they have some issues with their food
Menu was small, food overcooked, some very bland, some way too spicey
Price was right for the portions neighborhood
It had a nice atmosphere
Too bad I don't think it's going to be around long
I will definitely return to this hip spanish spot
The Tuna cerviche was excellent, the soy sauce it was served with had an excellent kick to it
I ordered the seafsoup which was amazing
Mussels clams shrimp in the most delicious rich spicey broth
And the greatest thing was how cheap the bill was
Paladar is a great place! the staff is always friendly and service is fast (I've eaten here over a dozen times over 2 years, including 2 large birthday parties in back garden - so TRUST ME)
The drinks are excellent - love the mojitos and passion fruit margaritas
The food is consistently very good and tasty - all fish dishes are excellent! and the prices are a great
This restaurant also has a wonderful and fun atmosphere - cool music, lighting, people
Just sort of stumbled upon this place while looking for a good brunch spot sunday afternoon
No wait at 2:00 pm, and the decor is funky and pleasant
Well, the scrambled eggs turned out to be great, and the whole meal was such a good value
Each brunch special comes with a complementary coffee and drink (you can choose from either an alcoholic or virgin selection of fruit juices
) My whole meal cost about 8 dollars
You get a good sense of the Spanish flavor as the eggs are complemented nicely not with hash browns and toast, but cooked yucca and a side of chopped tropical fruit
You'll find you won't miss the normal accompaniments at all
Great value, quick service, and a yummy Sunday morning
Great spot for a few appetizers before heading out to the bars in the area
Cheap and tasty food, amazing cocktails, and great atmosphere
A little loud, so don't come here for a first date, but definitely good for seconds
So the food was pretty good, I admit that
But this is NYC, you can get great food on every corner
The service at this place was so bad, it ruined by night
I am a former waiter, so I can more than tolerate poor or slow service
But this was out of control
I could bore you with the details, but just trust me
It was horrid
If this was a very cheap diner or the food was even reasonably priced, I could overlook it
And if I were the type of person to contact a manager, I would have
But I'm not

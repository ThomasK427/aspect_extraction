Needless to say, we did! Even if he hadn't sworn at us, I was already having doubts due to the overcrowding and the disturbing smell of drains that pervaded the restuarant - definately one to miss
This used to be one of my favorite places after a movie at the Landmark Sunshine cinema
Not any more
We ordered a cheese and ham plate at $14 and got x-ray thin slices not weighing more than 2 ounces total
The shrimp and mushrooms were nothing to write home about either
Then, $44 dollars later the waiter tells us that their credit card machine is broken and they take only cash, and didn't post it any place
I offered the guy a flat $40 cash and he took it
At least I got a discount, but I lost a favorite place
You'll never catch me in there again
This place could be something, but they have a very poor manager who does not understand the proper etiquette of serving and dining
Bottom line, the music is great to listen to and the ambiance small yet just right
But they are getting greedy with the customers and lack proper service
It truly is a shame
I am never going back to this place- the service is terrible
We complained to our waitress that the sangria was awful and asked to talk to the owner about it
He never turned up to discuss it but proceeded to glare at us from across the restaurant
We settled our bill and were ready to leave when the waitress came back to question whether our tip was at the lower end of the scale because we didn't like the sangria
We told her that it was and that we would be happy for the owner to comp the sangria and give her the amount we were charged for it ($30!) to her as a tip (which they did not do because the owner had left) Although the music and ambience is great, there are many tapas bars in New York with better service and attitude
went here on a friend's rec because they have white sangria
What a letdown
it had so much orange juice that it tasted more like a screwdriver
What made up for it was the great food
Its hard to find unique vegetarian tapas, but this place had a bunch, including a fantastic artichoke! I would go back, but would stick to plain wine
I love this place! I've went here in a big group and romantic dinner
The food is fabulous, one of the best tapas I've ever had
The music is great, the ambiance is casual, relaxed
I threw my boyfriend's surprise birthday party there and everyone LOVED the place and very impressed with the food
I recommend the mojito for a refreshing cocktail
They also have a live salsa band on Sunday nights
Tapas were great
I had a party of 4, 3 of 4 who had livedin Spain and tasted authentic tapas style dining
The 4 of us were very happy with the whole experience
And a little insight, same ownership next door at Carnaval
a cool cabana type lounge with a couple of floors, dj, great mojitos, etc
Make this a 1-2 punch and you'll be well fed and well drunk
Quick question: doesn't tapas usually come in pairs or more so that one can sample a few dishes at once? Oh yeah, isn't Oliva a tapas restaurant? Well, the manager rudely informed us that this was how the food is supposed to be served (one course every 30 or so minutes) and then claimed that Oliva is NOT a tapas restaurant
No Mr
and Mrs
Customers YOU are wrong!  After all this they also forgot one of the dishes and tried to charge us for it! After bad tapas, terrible service, and unjustified arrogance, all I can say is go elsewhere
Really great tapas, the real taste from Espana; great service too; not too pricey although not as cheap as in genuine bodegas
The only negative really was the chilly temperature: are they saving on the heating or what? How do they expect you grab boquerones with leather gloves?
Cuties abound at this place, both guys and girls
the staff and the crowd
Oh yeah, and the mojitos are pretty good too
i had the best new year at oliva i recoment it to every body if hip mix crow and fun music is great i love it check it out
Perhaps if the owner manager would concentrate more on service then acting as a dj this restaurant would run better
We went on a Saturday night and was told it would be a fifteen minute wait
While waiting we noticed the small cramped restaurant had service issues at every table from missing entrees, incorrect dishes and lack of service
I have no idea if the food was good it was such a mess we left before wasting our money on anything but the Sangria, which was mediocre at best
Oliva is a fairly standard tapas joint with standard tapas prices ($7-$10)
Sangria is pretty good (ask for no or little ice as mine was watery and devoid of flavor consequently), the tapas were unremarkable but the octopus was flavorful and the entrees unbalanced
The roasted chicken was great, but my roasted artichoke was oily, undercooked and seasoned badly
My suggestion save your $80 and put it toward a ticket to Seville
Pretty pricey for comfort food on Houston, but the meal is almost worth it
The trick is to have a snack in the afternoon, then just go and split an appetizer and an entree
The food is so rich and flavorful, you don't want to overdo it anyway
I went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal
It took nearly 2 hours to get in/out due to the service
Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it
Oh right, I should probably say something nice
Ummm
the beer was cold
I was looking forward to Orsay since I first heard about it
My experience was unfortunately the opposite of what I expected
I chose not to order off the restaurant week menu and to indulge in the filet
I ordered the steak medium, and it came to me virtually burned to a crisp
The description of shoe leather would not do my steak justice
To compliment the horrid texture, it was served with a bernaise sauce that tasted like feet
I love French food and have had bernaise sauce with almost every steak, and I can safely say this was the WORST bernaise sauce i have ever tasted
Ever
When I requested the peppercorn sauce instead of the bernaise, my entire steak and plate was taken away, which was unecessary
When it was returned, to my shock and horror, the steak had been cooked even MORE
and the peppercorn sauce was bland and tasteless
The waitress, sensing that I was about to freak out, began giving us free glasses of wine
It was exactly what I needed to forget the memory of this horrific meal
In addition to the food problems, the restaurant was so loud that I had to basically scream for my friend to hear me (who was a foot away)
We were also tightly packed into our seating and it felt more like family style dining than a private dining experience
For $40, they should be able cook a steak properly
Orsay was a severe disappointment all around
If they continue to give customers experiences like mine, I highly doubt they will last another six months
Go on a nice sunny day and ask for outdoor seating
This is a brunch lovers paradise :)
We went here hoping for an excellent Valentine's Day dinner
We were seated promptly, and that is where our dinner went downhill
It took 15 minutes to get a menu, another 20 minutes for a waitress to come and take our order
The food was delivered quickly - acceptable, but nothing to swoon over
Then we waited another 25 minutes (!) for ANYONE to come and take our dessert order (we had previously seen our waitress going outside for a cigarette break and never coming back)
After dessert, we asked the maitre de for our check three times and 10 minutes later we finally received our check
It was sad that the most attentive staff were the busboys
By the end of the night, THEY were the ones taking peoples orders! Next time, we'll definitley go somewhere else!
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's dinner
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'
Food and service was okay
Interior was so so
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris

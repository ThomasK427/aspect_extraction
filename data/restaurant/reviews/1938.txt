If you have time for a long leisure lunch, this is the place to be
Its so hard to find jewels in NYC like Bubbys! Great atmosphere and comfort food
You can actually have a beer and hold a conversation with somebody without having to yell
A breath of fresh air from the normal NYC bling-bling-bars
I've tried this place to feel all that fuss for myself and I was very disappointed, 1st the food came out about an hour later and the waiter didn't even say sorry, 2nd the dessert, I mean this is the 'Pie' famous place and believe me I've tasted so much better pies from other places with less money (even at Boston Market)
And if you don't like the noisy resturant then AVOID this place, you ears won't appreciated
Bubby's is must for everyone visiting Manhattan
The variety and value of the many menu offerings is always amazing
Listen carefully to your server as he or she provides the description of the specials:the creativity is endless and the taste is always wonderful
Bubby's is best at lunch and brunch, and the bright open space provides the perfect ambiance for a relaxing meal! Try to leave room for coffee and dessert, it is well worth it!! Bubby's is a great value!
There are few truly baby/family friendly places in the downtown area, and Bubby's in one of them
Although I am not of the baby toting set, I know this kind of place meets a certain demand
Family fun aside, the brunch can stand on it's own
I love the Swedish pancakes when they show up on the special
The other breakfast staples are done adequately
I prefer the sour cream pancakes to the regular ones served with the Big Breakfast
They seemed to always be out of the chicken apple sausage that has received so many raves
I wouldn't say Bubby's will blow you out of the water, but they provide a solid bunch served with good coffee
Not that you want dessert to wrap up a syrup topped bacon filled start to a day, but the pies and cakes are delish!
I have to admit I was excited to try out this place having never been here before and being that I don't live that far from it
What a disappointment
There were babies everywhere including on the table next to us where a parent decided it was appropriate to change a diaper
The food is way overpriced and those two biscuits they bring out before breakfast were harder than rocks
$14 00 for a frozen waffle with half a banana and a couple of strawberries strewn on top
Run as fast as you can from this place
The service was awful, the food mediocre at best (and that was the food that actually arrived - one entree arrived a good half hour after the others)
And all that after waiting well over an hour for a table
I just don't understand why it is popular
Great food, excellent breakfast and comfort food if you are staying in the tribeca/soho area
Usual wait on weekends is about 45 minutes as its very popular with local twentysomethings, celebrity sightings are common, relaxed atmosphere, child friendly as well
Visited the DUMBO location for brunch
The bad coffee was a harbinger of things to come
My entree was almost unedible, the toast tasted like cardboard the bacon tasted like the toast, only w/a smoky cardboardy-ness to it
The wait staff must think that I enjoy eating w/my hands b/c I had to ask for the utensils twice!
Visited the DUMBO location of Bubby's today, foolishly thinking it might be better than the Tribeca one
WRONG! They bought the same surly staff, it still took way too long for food, drink, ANY SERVICE and the food is still $ 12
95 for 2 eggs, bacon, toast coffee
It took them 15 minutes to bring a slice of pie to go! There are so many other places to go in Brooklyn, don't bother going here
I went to Bubby's hearing nothing but good things but was terribly disappointed
The service was disjointed, the food was sub-par (I agree with previous reviewer's comment on the biscuits), and the prices were ridiculous ($78 for three to eat breakfast!)
Don't go - there are too many other great places out there
Easily the worst breakfast I ever had
The tables outside wobbled, the biscuit (I think thats what it was, either that or left over over-baked pie dough) was inedible
I flipped at the prices so I just ordered eggs and toast
Eggs were over done, toast was cold
It was great, food was excellent, they did the best Bloody Mary I've had in my 17 years of being old enough to order one! And as for the pie, well I don't know if I'll ever taste one as good again
OK, don't expect silver cutlery and a 5 star service, its more of a family run sort of place
Sorry to see all the negative postings
My partner and I went twice while on holiday in New York, both weekdays at lunchtimes in May
Try at it, a great place to crash after 5 hurs of shopping!
Both times I have been to Bubby's for brunch the food was cold, flavorless, and the condiments non-existent
The table was dirty and sticky
Denny's serves a better Grand Slam breakfast--and at a quarter of the price (I paid $21 w/o tip for b-fast--I went back a second time, because the restaurant was highly touted and I thought the first bad experience was a fluke
Boy was I wrong--the second visit was worse than the first!)
In a city with as many wonderful restaurants as New York, it is beyond me why so many people rave about this place
Apparently, it's a place where you can see celebs, but if that's what you want, go to Bungalow 8
I live two blocks away and I see more famous people on the street
At Bubby's, the food is average at best, the menu is very limited and completely unimaginative, and the service is indifferent and slow (even when the place is empty)
You get the point
It's a waste
Expect your 30 minute wait for Sunday Brunch to be more like 45-60 minutes
On top of that, expect to wait another 35 minutes after you've placed your order (with no substitutions or special requests) for your food to arrive
Biscuits are good and flakey, with the delicious strawberry jam on the table, and the food is good, but overpriced
Went for dinner but thought I must have walked in on a kid's birthday party
Definitely not the scene that the editors of this page suggested it is
At 8:30 on a saturday night there were kids everywhere with bubby's baloons - perhaps if you're an 8-year-old this is the place to see and be seen
But I digress
Food was mediocre, bloody mary was below-average, pie was great
From the moment we walked in the door we felt like we were at home
I brought my mom and my girlfriend there and they both agreed the meatloaf and the barbecue were the best they've had
The staff was friendly
Even the bartender
I expected grand things from the way people raved about this place
It didn't happen
The ribs tasted as though it was soaked in vinegar
The fact that I paid for potato chips with blue cheese make who the silly one!-
the food is typical american fare
the desserts are pretty good
the service at the bar is hardly anything to rave about
The service is sub-par, and the food is average
The only thing this place has going for it is the occasional De Niro sighting and the outdoor seating
Walker's Restaurant on the corner of Varick and N
Moore has better food, and never a wait!
Because on Saturday, it's children's day! They can eat for free and there are a lot of families!! Yes, I hit this Saturday and it was so noisy
and quite disappointed by too much grilled meat stuff
My guidebook highly recommended this place, but I feel the quality has been getting down
Bubby's has everything you crave when it starts getting cold out
The service is friendly and the food is real down-home good
Excellent barbecue; better pies than you can get anywhere
Bubby's is known almost as an 'institution' in NYC
I'ved lived in NYC all my life and tried it for the first time last weekend
What a horrible disappointment
The food was bland, the service was terrible
I'm sure it was great 'in the beginning' but like so many NY places, the hype makes these places lazy and stop trying
People with no taste buds or no mind of their own can write a decent review of this place
The only saving grace was the Key Lime pie
worth the wait
go with friends
bloody mary's and house special mimmosas are a great choice
i had the crunchy french toast special and it was awesome

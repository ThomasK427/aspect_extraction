When the other half of my party arrived, the waited helped us with the menu, and i was happy to know you can mix and match items in their lunch box I got the mekong box and i could not believe how great the pork sandwich was, I also enjoyed the asian salad and brownie tremendously
My friend stayed true to the american lunch and ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and she literally didnt shut up about how it was one of the best she had
The service was quick and friendly, and the prices where nice as well, I believe I have found my new luncheon spot
Came in from Texas, gathered group of 6 of locals and visitors, and visited Sapa on Sunday, 7/2/06
Amazing decor, great service, good looking staff, freindly, and overall a great experience
Had the $34 steak which was excellent
Everyone enjoyed the food and wine
Highly reccommended
One note: I'm a young lad (24) so I'm a little cheap
came in because they have $15 specials on Sunday, BUT they were all out of them! Arrrg
So, this was 930pm
get there early if you wanna sample the menu at the lowered rate
Overall, though, loved it and will reccommend it!
I know this place has gotten some negetive comments for the music but as a child/teenager of the 80's I must say it was eclectic and it was a great mix
Beyond all of that though the food was outstanding
I had the Steamed Mussels and Clams and the sauce was to die for
From there I moved on to the Coriander Ahi Tuna and it was served over an Oxtail which sounded odd but the combination was more than perfect
I didnt try the winelist but I did enjoy the Ginger Passion Margarita to start then moved to the Cosmojito needless to say I was really full and drunk
I loved my experience, my waiter, and the atmosphere as well
after hearing my friend rave about this place (giving it all 10s), i took my bf here this wknd
the place was playing obnoxious 80s music, and the bar is oddly close to the dining area, making for a very loud dinner
it would be better to place the bar closer to the front of the restaurant and away from the tables
i was a little disappointed that they no longer offer the prix fixe dinner
we started with the rice paper roll of the day (mahi mahi, $10) and the spareribs ($13)
the ribs were fork-apart tender and juicy but i couldnt taste the cocoa that was supposed to be in them
it also tasted like good chinese food, which i like, but it wasn't what i expected
for our main courses, i had the cod ($30) he had the nori-wrapped salmon ($30)
the cod was delicious flaky and tender, served atop a pile of buttery mashed potatoes with mushrooms
the salmon was also good lightly seared, wrapped in tempura seaweed, atop a pile of nicely sour picked vegetables
after such a strong showing, dessert was a letdown per our waiters recommendation, we ordered the raspberry softie the coconut-stuffed apricots the softie tasted like a mixture between cough syrup a starburst, whereas the apricots were extremely sour
the apricots' saving grace was a small scoop of hazelnut ice cream, unceremoniously dumped on top of the hot fruit at the table
more ice cream would have helped the sourness a little
we were presented with freshly-baked hot chocolate chip cookies (on the baking sheet) along with our check making for a much better dessert #2
including tax tip, the total came to be about $135
service was very good
Pay for what you DON'T get
Despite the great things that are written about SAPA, it is NOT worth the long wait
we called to make a reservation for a friends birthday, The hostess told us we could drink in the lounge while we waited
she neglected to mention the large party in the lounge
the bar was too crowded and the bartenders were scattered and unattentive
the 5 of us ordered a bunch of different entrees
don't bother to go there if you want food
The prices were ridiculous for the amount of food we got
the waiter not nice, the bus boys-TOO attentive, taking our plates before we could eat the little food we got
not only that, they kept making the wrong drinks
service was not that great
not recommended
Had dinner with 3 friends Friday night
The service was solid; they put together a nice oyster platter appetizer that was not on the menu
Wine list is great and main courses also outstanding
It is a little loud and since the layout is very open (decor is lovely) it is nice for a date but not necessarily romantic
Still a good value and a good choice
When I arrived late and noticed my date had yet to arrive I was nervous there would be a problem with seating
The friendly host sat us down 30 minutes after or reservation time which I was greatful
The extra 30 minutes allowed me to sample the happy hour
The Sapa Hemmingway Daquiri was on of the best mixed drinks I have tasted in NYC
When we sat down the service was freindly efficient and helpful with the extensive wine list
We ordered the roll sampler to start which was a great light way to intro our meal
From there we had the grilled swordfish and the grilled rib eye both cooked to perfection
The desertm the peanut tapioca was peculiar and unique but oh so good, the peanut tapioca
As a thank you they served us chocolate chip cookies
I will be returning
Went there on a saturday night
Had fabulous drinks, the R
Cavalli Vodka was delicious, a Ginger margarita was not far from it
Te food was awe-inspiring from the papaya salad to the cod and the tuna steak, Service was okay, nothing special, nothing irritating
The only thing whihc i (and my partner) never heard before was: the waitress mentioned the price of the specials (?)
The music was awful
One would expect Thievery Corp, old Kruder Dorfmeister, Loungy Zero 7 a dreamy electronica mix
with the ambience and food
But we got 80's galore, which was so wrong, there was headbopping DuranDuran, The Cure, Bros (???)
So, 5 points deducted, also for loudness
Get someone w taste on yoru iPOd, then you'll get 10 points form me

Great $5 cocktails $1-$4 bar finger food! Their happy hour is excellent
Staff is extremely friendly attentive
No attitude here! Space is amazing
Decor is tasteful with lots of innovative accents set up
The bathroom set up is beautiful
You must check it out
The restaurant is huge w/ a whole bunch of diff
seating areas
Very interesting
Dinner for the most part was nice a little overpriced and food didn't blow me away
Rice papper rolls were nice
Corriander tuna w/ oxtail combo was weird
Quality of everything was excellent though
I was ready to leave after the 5-dollar Martini (I got what I paid for), but my friend who used to love AZ forced me to eat at the dining room
I'm glad I did
Rice paper rolls were tasty and great to share, and monkfish with lobster salad was delicious

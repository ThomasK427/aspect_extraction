keep up the great work

Wait wasn't too long and food was served very quickly
Loved their pepperoni pizza but meatball pizza was not as good
Thin but slightly chewy crust along with the perfect sauce and real mozzarella cheese made it a one memorable meal
Lombardi's was featured on the food channel 2 years ago as the best pizza in NY - after 2 years I finally got the opportunity to taste it
We took the train to Spring street and walked, walked and walked some more, (wee got of at the wrong station! ) - we made finally made it there
no reservation needed, quick service, cozzy set up and the pizza was the best i've ever had
Well worth the walk, can't wait to go back
the best pizza you will ever have
The crust, the toppings, everything on that pie is awsome!!!!!!
WHAT A THRILL IT WAS FOR MY FAMILY AND I TO EAT AT LOMBARDI'S, THE PIZZA WAS EXCELLENT AND THE CRUST WAS COOKED JUST THE WAY WE LIKE IT
THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND I LOVED THE ATMOSPHERE (I WANTED TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND HELP OUT)! ESPECIALLY ALL THE FAMILY PHOTOS
OUR NAME IS LOMBARDI ALSO AND THE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE WAS UNCANNY! OUR SON LIVES AND WORKS IN MANHATTAN AND THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO DO UPON ARRIVAL WAS TO GO TO LOMBARDI'S! I KNOW I WILL BE BACK AGAIN ON OUR NEXT VISIT AND HOPE TO BRING MORE LOMBARDIS WITH ME! MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I COULDN'T BRING BACK SOME PIZZA FOR OUR PARENTS WHO ARE IN THEIR LATE 80'S
I KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED IT!
As a born and raised New Yorker, Lombardi's coal created pizza is nothing short of AMAZING! Now living in MA (of course still a die hard Yankee's fan!), every trip back to visit Dad includes a Lombardi's trip
I have to go with their basic pizza as my favorite - fresh cheese, a hint of basil, and their sauce must have a secret that cannot be duplicated! A fresh salad completed the meal and of course something off tap
Service is fantastic and the price is more than right
I only wish it wasn't so good that I had left-overs to bring back to MA!!!
This is the place for definitive NY pizza
My first time in the Big Apple and I had heard about Lombardi's in a book called New York for Dummies
The day before I went to Lombardi's, I had a slice at another NY place
It did not compare with Lombardi's
I could have eaten two larges by myself
I spent 3 days in NY and this was the highlight
I will gladly recommend it to anyone that I know of traveling to Ny
It is the crown jewel in Little Italy
By the way, the cappucino was great, also
I live in California but visit Manhattan twice ayear and I'm always looking for good pizza since there is a dearth of it in California
I'm aware of the passionate feelings of New Yorker's for their favorite pizza, but I would like to add my insight as a pizza lover and visitor to Manhattan
John's - overrated but good; Lombardi's - great pizza; Patsys -very good;Totonnos-possibly the best pizza in New York!!
This pizza is so good
And very affordable
Just beware of rude server girls w/attitudes and you'll be fine
I have eaten at Pizza places all across the nation
And not a single one can hold a candle to the flame that Lombardi's has
They have got, not only the best customer service and atmosphere, but the BEST Pizza I have ever eaten in my life
If you want to go somewhere that you will remember for the rest of your life, it's Lombardi's! You won't be disappointed!
Went there last time and pizza was as good as ever!!! Must get the pepperoni and excheese pie
Crust is cooker perfectly
Just suburb!!!
After seeing this on the Travel Channel as having the best pizza in NYC, we definitely wanted to try it
I really liked the decor, the brick walls, the music-It was very inviting
The service wasn't really great
They weren't rude exactly, but didn't act like they really needed to be nice either
We just got a pizza with sauce and cheese
It was very good
Next time, we will get extra cheese though
It wasn't quite cheesy enough
It was $23 for pizza and drink pitcher
Not bad for NYC prices
We will definitely return on our next visit to NYC
I visted nyc the past summer from chicago and loved this place, excellent thin crust pizza (I know it is heretical to say this at home, but I like the thin stuf better) and great pepperoni
Lombardi is a new york instituation, however, it certainly did not serve the best pizza in town, much less in the world, as the menu claimed (For the record, the best pizza I've had so far was in a diner close to the main port in Capri)
The crust was thin, but not baked to a chewy perfection, nor charred to a crusty smokiness
The tomato was forgettable, in fact I suspect it was not house-made
The toppings were scarce and ridiculous - they called a few slivers of brown mushroom wild? Service was mediocre, though I didn't have to wait
To be fair, this would be a local delight if it were in a regular suburb, and decoration is charming
But New York has too many better options
Next time I'm going over to the Midwood place to try
Great location, great ambience, good service, don't miss this NYC experience
Me being a big time pizza fan my whole life and I've had pizza from here to Italy and back
I'd have to say I had high hopes for lombardis coal oven pizza
but when my girlfriend and I went there, the service was horrible and the pizza was mediocre
enough said
don't believe all the hype
I posted a review on 03/28/2003 about how much I liked this place
I went there recently
The restaurant is now bigger, but the pizza is no longer anything special
It had charred edges, but was mushy and floppy
Pepperoni was little wafers instead of big chucks like it used to be
It is sad to see a real NYC gem turn so-so
It resembles more of a tourist trap now
I was waiting more than 40 minutes, because a receptionist skipped my turn and I had to wait other 30 minutes my pizza which is just average one with bad taste chianti wine
Do not cheat about their long history of the restaurant
Dear Mr
Lombardi:  We had the greatest time ever trying to find your pizza shop on the subway and then enjoying a spectacular lunch
My husband said that it was the best pizza he had ever eaten and that it was the highlight of his trip
Thanks for giving us a wonderful memory and a super pizza
You tomatoes in the salad were fresh and a very high quality
Merry Christmas Debbie and Tom Goral from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
My boyfriend wanted to go to this place for awhile
But after we went there, we discovered it was way overhyped
The menu does not have much and what we did have - original pizza with pepperoni and sausage was not so great
This place is just okay
There are a lot of better pizzerias out there
When my mom and me took the bus down to NYC for the day about a week or so ago, we had the pleasure to eat at Lombardi's
We were thinking about somewhere to eat, Tavern on the Green?! No, to expensive
McDonalds?! No, we can eat there at home
Then when we caught a cab, we asked about and good pizza places around, and he told us about Lombardi's and the rest is history! And I GUARENTEE if any of my friends go to NYC I will tell them to stop therem and if I go, then I WILL stop again for a little slice of heaven!  ~Paul
i had their clam pie yesterday and it's out of this world
basically it's a clam pizza stuffed with herbs and cheese
have it with stella beer
it doesn't get any better than this
comfort food and a casual atmosphere
I went there last year after graduation with my mom and brother
We are from Europe and know exactly what kind of pizza we like
Crispy hot crust, from a wood brick oven, a little burnt on the edges, not too much, just to give you that hint of a smoky taste
The toppings were all incredibly fresh and the pizza was huge! All three of us agreed that despite having had plenty of pizza in Italy, that this was one of the best pizza's we've ever had
There is no way that I would go back to NYC without revisiting this restaurant

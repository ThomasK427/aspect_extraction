Hope I get the day right
This has to be one of the biggest rip-offs in the city
Last Evening we had the Friday special Bouillabaisse, which was supposed to have lobster, crab mussels and oysters
When it arrived there were four mussels and only enough soup to cover the bottom of the bowl
(This for $22?!) This said, the bus boys didn't wait for us long enough to try and eat it before they started taking plates away
We also had the charcutrie plate
The hams were insipid and tasted no better than packed supermarket meat and one of the sausages definately looked like Oscar Meyer
The Bourdeau wines are thin and watery yet they still charge $9-$12 a glass for them
I lived around the corner and have watched this place go from the prosaic to mediocrity to outright highway robbery
Stay Away
Their site says A Parisian dining experience with a plush velvet lounge
and I might agree that I had a somewhat Parisian dining experience, but I'd have to disagree on the lounge
I was hoping for something a bit more romantic, but it may just have been the day of the week (Tuesday) or the snowy weather
Either way, our waiter Amal was great but the bus boys were way over-eager to take our meals away from us
My girlfriend and I were having a lengthy casual meal, but had to fend off the bus boys multiple times
As a local of the neighborhood, this restaurant is the new hot spot!!! Come and see for yourself and enjoy a shrimp cocktail and a cosmo after a long hard day of Summer shopping!!!
This place is the new hangout! The neighborhood and outdoor dining makes me feel like dancing


which is located downstairs in the bleu room
The wine list is extensive
I love the fruits de mer, a must for those Summer days
Great service great environment!!!! The raw bar is awesome
The perfect place for parties
Very hot party planner, Darlene
Bring your friends here for Friday night hangin
I love cafe Deville!!!! Very cool and metropolitan but comfortable with a provencale flair
It is great for social gatherings whether business or pleasure
The staff are very accomidating
I recently had a business gathering that Darlene Pergola (cafe deville) made sure that it went perfectly


she is the perfect party planner
Cafe Deville will be one of my regular haunts as its friendly staff makes me feel right at home
The little bleu bar located downstairs is the perfect french little club, with a lounge area and fabu bar
I can't say enough


you must experience this for yourself!!!
I threw a 30th B day party in the downstairs lounge at Cafe Deville and had a blast
The appetizers and cocktails were great, so was the music! Very convenient location and great crowd!
We loved the crabcakes, the french onion soup, the collosal shrimp and super fresh oysters served with a variety of sauces
The drinks were great too
As our economy keeps falling
Cafe Deville keeps rising
Upon my arrival, I was greeted with wonderfull hospitality
The Manager greeted us and escorted us to a table
We started off with drinks: a great selection and fast service
Our appetizers crab cakes and raw bar selections
we all chowed down with out having to worry about calories
Then we ordered 7 entree's between us and passed the plates to create a taster party
I was able to taste everything
Delicious! The steak was lean the fish was fresh the duck was juicy and the chicken was tender
The portion's were large we didn't have room for dessert
I am in the buissiness and if I did not have a great experience you would have heard about it
Considering our economy, its only natural that I let people know what a wonderfull experience we had and if you have an opportunity, eat here!
Friday night, I was looking for an Italian restaurant and stumbled into Cafe Deville thinking it was
Walked in to the dimly lit, nicely decorated restaurant with my boyfriend and was worried that the menu was rather limited
To my surprise, the tomato/mozzerella appetizer was delicious and the string bean and walnut salad was one of the tastiet salads I have ever had
Our entrees were also very delicious
The waiter was very attentive, almost too attentive bordering on stalker-like (maybe in response to all the bad reviews!) Overall, not the best restaurant ever, but a great find where I will definitely retur
Great space, friendly service and excellent bistro food
Go anytime, always room, no wait and a cool place to hang
What a great find
Tasting plate of pate feed two of us
The wine consistently enjoyable
Service always pleasing
The place has a look from the outside that's inviting, suggesting it will deliver terrific French food
We went on a cold night, were among very few eating in what was too cold a room
I had my coat wrapped around me and was shocked that the food wasn't better since it's quite pricey
Given the number of choices - particularly for this sort of food - I'm surprised it's surviving
The food was good, albeit pricey
The main attraction is the brunch jazz band on Sundays - the singer is like a blue-bird/Billie Holiday that will leave you to stop all other activities after every song, and clap to your heart's delight
A great place for hanging out
My friends and I were walking by and there was a group of guys outside eating
They asked us to join them
It looked clean, the guys were cute and who can beat eating outside on 3rd avenue, with prime East village people watching
Im gald we did
The food was excelllent, the service was great and the live DJ spinning awesome tunes made the entire evening a Blast
Not only did I leave full, I got a date! And in NY, we all know thats hard to come by!
I was very excited to try Cafe Deville
Unfortunately, the service there was so poor, it made the entire dinning experience painful
I was so disappointed
I was charged twice as much
The service was terrible
The baked flounder still has so many bones
talk about laziness
Definitely not a pleasant experience
The Scene This four-story restaurant sits snugly in a handsomely restored brownstone on the eponymous Harlem hill
The interior is well lit and finely furnished, and filled with attractive local art
Service is friendly but can be quite amateurish, particularly when confronted with the hordes of European tourists that the weekends' gospel brunches draw in abundance
The Food This is deeply satisfying home-style Southern cooking: never light, yet somehow subtle in flavor and texture
Timeless dishes, like supple, juicy roasted ribs marinated in Tennessee whiskey, heady chicken-and-sausage jambalaya, and rich, almost-black gumbo, succeed dramatically
Alternative fare, such as delicate olive-dressed trout and a hefty, bunless burger, excels as well
At brunch, excellent fried chops and chicken join the hits from the dinner menu; avoid, however, the uninspired, tough pancakes and French toast
A varying selection of desserts, sadly, also mostly miss the mark: An arid red velvet cake is a particular dud
Unless you are a fan of sushi and prefer your seafood raw, STAY AWAY from the LOBSTER! The service leaves a bad taste in your mouth
With gratuity being included with parties of 6 or more there is no need to be efficient
Watch out for the water glasses, unless you prefer the imprint of cheap red lipstick already left behind
my b-friend and I stopped by recently for happy hour drinks; the wait staff was very courteous and attentive

I found Candela while searching the web for restaurants in the city since I am not very familiar with New York
I was very pleased with Candela
It has a great atmoshphere for romance and fun
The food was great, from the seafood to the stuffed pork chop(my boyfriend loved this!), and I cant think of one complaint regarding the service
The prices were great as well, not as expensive as it says
I think the highest priced entree was about 28
00, not bad for a nice dinner considering it is NY!! I know a lot of people that head to the city, and will definitely recommend this restaurant to them!
I was expecting a magical, romantic place and was a bit disappointed
The restaurant doesn't look as great in person as it does in the citysearch photo in my opinion
Food was decent, staff very friendly
I'd go back for drinks
I had my parents Surprise 35th Anniversary party there and was EXTREMELY pleased!! It was absolutely perfect
They were so accomadating and helped take care of the little details
Being that I was throwing it and were actually bringing my parents there I was concerned with the way things would be unitl we got there
The food was amazing, the service was PERFECT and the place looked fantastic
Thank you Candela for making a day my parents will never forget!!!
I have been to Candela a couple of times, and I have been generally satisfied
The ambience IS great, as most have commented, as is the service
In my opinion, their slightly better than average eclectic American offerings CAN compete with more generously rated restaurants offering the same cuisine
Definitely worth a try, especially if they have the risotto with woodear mushrooms and sirloin tips as a special that evening!
Great first date place, with the exception of the EXTREMELY rude waiter
He must have had someplace much more important to be because he treated us like we were wasting his time! The food was very good and the ambiance romantic
Great creme brule to share
The place was filled with couples
Enzo and Gino will tke care of you
The kitchen is immaculate as are the tables, linens, glasses,etc
The food is ecellent and the only thing you smell when you walk in is the great aroma of home-cooked Italian food
This is not the typical American-Italian heavy food that one might be used to - this is te real thing
from the Veal Chop Milanese to the Pasta con Sarde
You will not be disappointed
(Wine is ultra-expensive here) I go here a lot and only take a few close friends with me
Try asking Gino for recommendations
he'll steer your right
I have always gotten excellent service at Bussola!
great gelato
excellent cuisine
this place is for the few lucky enough to know of it
Humble from the outside, but romantic and so delicious inside
I think because it's on a less popular and populated section of 4th Ave, Bussola does not get the kind of attention it deserves
But trust me that it guarantees one of the best Southern Italian meals in all of Manhattan
Be sure to sample the homemade gelato!
went here recently - had the BEST grilled calamari ever, wonderful linguine with clam sauce - and awesome coffee gelato
Staff was eager to please
Will go there whenever in the neighborhood, and encourge others to try
Its a gem!!
The gelato place section of the restaurant is horrible
The service is really atrocious
I did not know that service could be that insulting and rude
It was as if we were in shambles and begging for food
Don't even think about asking a question
My friend asked about a flavor, and the woman behind a counter just stuck out her hand for money
Maybe they should take to order before asking for money? There are better packed gelato elsewhere
I'm very food picky So for me to write a good review for a resturant is rare
LAN is one of the best Japanese Food Places I have ever been
They have a menu that really steps away from the normal when it comes to asian dining
I had a layered flaky fish that I would say had a french flair to it
The only thing was I wish the portion was larger
I will go back for more
Rosa
This was the best service I've ever received in New York City
My boyfriend and I shared the Prime Rib Shabu Shabu for two
The quality of the meat was excellent
The vegetables were fresh
The Peanut Sauce was perfect and the other sauce was great too
For appetizers we started out with the oyster special, why not when it was only $14! We also ordered yellowtail sushi- very good and edamame-can't go wrong
For dessert I had the green tea tiramisu and ice cream- I loved both, my bf who doesn't really like green tea actually really liked the tiramisu
The atmosphere here is relaxing and serene, check out the bathroom- it's beautiful
I highly recommend this restaurant, especially for a date
Went for dinner with 3 friends and had great service, great sushi and did not feel rushed at all
Place is small enough that the noise is not deafening
Could have a pleasant dinner conversation w/o shouting over the crowd
Try the warm sake--delicious!
went with 8 people for dinner on a saturday night
Got there at 9:30
they servced us drinks but we never got the food!!! They kept on giving us drinks, running up a tab, and said that the sushi was backed up
Meanwhile, everyone else in the restaurant was being served but us!! Bottom line is that we ended up walking out at 12:30- 3 HOURS LATER!!! we were the only people left in the restaurant- they were cleaning up as we left
the manager offered us some more free wine- very insulting!! ended up walking out with $40 off of a $300 bill
This place is terrible
The ambience service of Lan is still wonderful, but its food has seen better days
One of the appetizer specials, the Aquatic Trio, featured 3 tiny bowls of unpleasant textures
The Chef's Sashimi for $28 was just decent
In addition, the Green Tea Tiramisu (which used to be heavenly) has become a stack of cream sprinkled with green tea powder
Aye, perhaps it was just a bad night???
I've been eating at Lan twice a month for the past 3 years
The sushi here is amazing
Generous portions and an incredible selection
The steak here is excellent
Make a reservation, especially on the weekends
The bar is quite the hangout too
We ordered a few dishes for our family, only to have them tell us almost an hour after we sit down, that they were out of ingredients for 2 of the plates we ordered
We'd already waited long enough for 2 appetizers and were very agitated
The manager did not do much to apologize, and just said that the waitress will be scolded appropriately
Totally not her fault, poor girl
We got free desserts, but the whole meal just left a bad taste in our mouth
I say they are not very professional or good in the food service industry
They have the best fusion dishes and desserts!! Try their toro nigiri too, it's so yummy
Service is just ok
Very diffcult to get them to come to your table
I think they are understaffed
Despite having an 8 pm reservation on Friday, we were seated 40 minutes later without any apology whatsoever

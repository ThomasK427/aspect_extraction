The best eggplant parm I've ever had
The place has simple italian food that tastes awesome, big portions, and great price
The backroom is great for casual first-dates
I've been here many times and is my favorite italian rest
in manahattan
The upside to John's is that the food is very good
Home cooked italian, individual or family style and the individual orders are enormous!! The downsides are the no credit cards and it is a little snug
Make a reservation before you go
But it's well worth the trip!
I have been going to John's for 13 years and have ALWAYS enjoyed it
Even though I have moved out of the neighborhood, I still go back for the wonderful food, relaxing atmosphere and great service
In fact, it's Valentine's Day and I am looking forward to a romantic, delicious dinner with my man
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather go for a special Valentine's date
Passed this place a few times cause we live nearby
Looked nice
So, we decided to go
1
No place to wait, cramped us in by the bar for a good 20 minutes
Then, we finally sit, look at the menu, which, might I add, is nothing special
Thank God, I notice the little tidbit about this place that NOONE on this site has said
NO CREDIT CARDS! Yeah, so we walked out
I guess this is one of those places that you need to be in the know, and we weren't, so oh well
Loud, packed, nosy, snotty, no credit cards, and we didn't even eat there
Everything we've tried here tastes homemade and simply delicious
If you're looking for great, simple italian food, there's no better place than John's
Even the ambiance is quaint and homey here
The portions are large (truly italian) and service is friendly and casual
You can't be disappointed by the food here
The veal is remarkably tender and flavorful, and they have the portions to match
The decor is old-style late forties, but real
Not like the nouveau-kitsch places that you'll see all over the East Village that try and look this way
One major drawback - The grated parmesan cheese was absolutely horrible
I strongly recommend sampling it before placing it on your food, or it'll ruin your whole dish
I returned it once, thinking it had turned, but the next jar was just as bad
I had to return a side of pasta, but no big deal, it didn't really need the cheese anyway
Cheese notwithstanding
The food and service were too good to give them a bad rating
Highly Recommended
Two Words: Avocado Bruchetta Simply Awesome
Don't expect anything fancy, this place is great eats, with so-so service, it's really good for large groups
Gets noisy, but so what
Pretty cheap for the nice sized servings, go with some friends, and remember my two words
Affordable and delectable
Try the papardelle and the portobello mushrooms
Ive never been disappointed here
The food in this restuarant is only slightly better than the service
The entire staff is just plain rude
The food simply has no flavor
I would not recommend this place
There are plenty of Vietnamese / Chinese cuisine on 3rd Ave, no need to waste money here
I went with a few people from Hong Kong
All of them said that this was terrible Chinese food
I thought it was standard cheap Chinese food, definitely not worth going back to
it must be said!!!! when ordering in chinese food you have to wonder? do i really want chinese tonight? and then tang appears!!! the food totally rocks - as far as chinese can then they customize the food according to your preference
no salt no msg no ____ you get the picture
all in all, when take out comes to mind and dilevery is the only option for the evening
consider tang and a movie - you will not be disappointed
OH i forgot to mention
the delivery is ASAP
I LOVE TANG
The Scene A wood-burning oven puts forth heavenly aromas in the front room, where drop-in diners sip wines by the glass as they wait for a Tavern Room table
There's a pleasant worn-in appeal to the space, and many locals prefer it to the main dining room, where special-occasion diners enjoy a more formal ambience
No matter where you sit, though, service is the same: clever, well-versed and always on top of it
The Food The kitchen's seasonal New American bent makes for earthy, satifsying fare with an undercurrent of elegance
Smoked paprika-rubbed quail atop buttery polenta arrives with a marvelous raisin-mustard sauce; addictive chicken liver pate tops crostini
But it's the hearty meats that earn the Tavern its lofty reputation, including stellar braised lamb and one of the best filet mignons to be found outside of a steak house
The apple tatin is an excellent way to finish
$76 for the 3 course menu
The servings were generous, the selection was really good and the food and atmosphere were fantastic
Very impressed
Everything about this place was great
I loved the fact that they serve top notch food in a comfortable atmosphere
The tasting menu is out of this world and kudos to the waitstaff
I've been to several so-called nice romantic restaurants in NY, but this one was the first ever to either meet or exceed my expectations
I was accidentally late for my reservation, but was seated in a very nice area anyway and the place was busy
The hostess could not have been nicer
I had one primary waiter, Stafford, who was great
He was assisted by another
They were out of the way, but were always there
They didn't hover, but stepped in from nowhere to anticipate every need
The food was great
The ambience was the best
I had been referred to another restaurant (One if by Land


), but this was far beyond that place
The price is not cheap, but you get all and more for your dollar
Truly the best place in NY
Gramercy Tavern is great food for reasonable prices
Other reviewers commented on having chicken, salad and a tart for $76 and being unimpressed
Sure, the house salad is nothing to write home about, but feeling cheated over this is like buying an expensive bottle of wine and wondering why you paid so much
Like any restaurant, Gramercy has less cost-efficient plates
Ordering the smallest prix fixe menu and choosing the most run-of-the-mill items for dinner will, of course, be expensive
At the Tavern, you can have a fantastic cocktail and a delicious appetizer and entree with wine as well as dessert for under $50, anytime between 12pm and 11pm
That's a deal
The staff is wonderfully cordial and attentive, the food is delicious and varied (you can get inventive dishes besides just run-of-the-mill chicken), and the atmosphere is at once homey and spectacular
It's no wonder the restaurant continues to be a mainstay of NYC dining
I had always wanted to try this restaurant, but was very disappointed
The servings were small and the entrees were ordinary
One of us had salad (only lettuce and vinaigrette) and chicken and a small tart for dessert--$76

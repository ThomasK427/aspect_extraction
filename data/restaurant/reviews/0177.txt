And, judging by former reviews, the regular chef must have been somewhere else with his sweetheart because the food was amateurish
way too much oil and salt
if you're into people watching, craft is great -- room was filled with celebs, models and investment bankers
the food, however, is nothing spectacular (desserts are great, though)
The food was spectacular, and the service was great, as always
We loved the braised short ribs, the turnips and sweet potatoes, especially the scallops, which are always a hit --- really anything and everything on the menu is, but order two portions of the Nantucket scallops
We ordered just about one of everything and shared amongst our group
To celebrate the holidays, or for any occasion, this is New York's best and Victor, their hot new GM makes the experience outstanding
Celebrating the holidays with the Craft family just makes this time of year all the more festive
no imagination
Maybe that's the concept
It's fresh food being perfectly cooked but that's all
No imagination
no sauces, broth's, no exciting or unique combinations
Maybe I'm missing the point!?
HAD A PARTY FOR 22 PEOPLE- SPEND MORE THAN 2000 DOLLARS
fOUR PEOPLE SHOWED UP LATE AND WERE TREATED SO RUDELY THAT THEY LEFT WIITHOUT EATING
tHEY DID NOT NOTIFY ME THAT THE FOURSOME PARTY WOULD BE FORFEITED
iMAGINE IF I HAD ONLY SPENT 200 HOW BADLY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED
DO'T GO THERE EVEWN IF YUO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY
I went to Craft yesterday with my boyfriend for our anniversary
We were seating in a table in the front corner, which was perfect if you are looking for a romantic nook
We sampled the oysters, sweetbreads, and octupus terrine for appetizers
All were very fresh, and the sauce for the sweetbreads was rich and delicious
The braised short ribs were phenomenal, soft, flavorful, with small, sweet chunks of carrot
The polenta, swiss chard, and hen of the wood mushrooms were also great, especially the polenta
Peach tart was the best crust I've had in a long time, buttery yet, so light
Fantastic meal, and coming to $220 with a $73 bottle of wine, not outrageous either compared to other NYC places
Outstanding! My fav restaurantin NYC
I truly feel like a queen there and the food is so innovative and fresh
I also thought it was really romantic, worth the two month wait!
High end cusine presented family style, what a fun concept for a New York restaurant
And Craft is able to pull it off with aplomb
More casual atmosphere than I expected, dress was Gattaca black but with more clusters of denimn than I expected
And after many years of dining in New York I think we found a waiter that actually likes being a waiter, how refreshing
Craft was one of the first places to offer food simply and let the quality and flavor speak for itself
And, it is still one of the best
Whether it is a steak or halibut filet, the flavors speak for themselves
Who would have thought that a celery puree could be this good? The room is stunning, but I would have to agree with other reviewers that space is a bit tight
Just celebrated our 15th anniversary at Craft
We were seated at a lovely, intimate table (unusual for this restaurant)
Our server was not only knowledgable about the food and wine, but was extremely intelligent and witty
The food was so amazingly fresh and well-prepared
I haven't a bad word to say
It's amazing
So what if you have to make a few decisions - that's half the fun!
We were greated at the door by an attentive and beautiful young lady with blonde hair blue eyes that made our evening a fabulous dining experience
A magnificent table in a glorious setting along with a wine list second to none
Fabulous entrees as well as deserts to die for
First class right from Hello! We hated to have to leave
Bravo!
After not eating at craft in several months, I recently went for diner with friends on a Saturday night
It was as good, if not better than I had remebered
The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive, offering suggestions only when asked
When our food arrived we were not disappointed with our selections
Simple, yet perfectly delicious! It a pleasure to eat food that is not dredged in sauces and layered with too many flavors
The desserts were equally as impressive
Be sure to save room!
How could anyone call this an LA-esque restuarant, trying to be NY? All things Collichio = NY
The food is first class
The service attentive and thoughtful
And the dining room is one of the most beautiful in the city, notwithstanding the noted bright lights
They were 25 minutes late seating us; first round of drinks were on the house
[Actually, how pleasantly un-NY
] One drawback: the tables are scaled for the space, meaning they were big
I felt far away from my companions
I guess everyone has different tastes
I don't see it
I frequent the best of NY restaurants
This just does not measure up in any way
The food was very dissapointing, especially for the price
This was like an LA restaurant - trying to be NY! The bar was great, however and do recommend drinks and some bar bites there
I must say that being a born and raised true New Yorker, I'm rarely impressed by any restaurant or celeb chef in this town
I've done all of the Jean Georges, Bittalli, I've done Le Bernadine, Daniel, Nobu, Chodorow, you name it
But Craft is by far something else, the decor is hipply stylish, the wine bar is oFF DA HOOK, the staff could be better but they are on point
It doesn't really matter though because the food, let me tell you IMPRESSIVE
I mean i go at least twice a month and while it is expensive, if you're looking to spend some of your hard earned money on one hell of a meal, go for it, you cannot go wrong at Craft
To all of you who wrote a bad review, stay home you obviously have no clue!!
excellent food, great wine selection
i couldn't complain about what we ate and drank there
perfect everything,, except staff's attitude
you will encounter very snobish employees there
i didn't really care cuz i was too busy enjoying the food and wine, but my friends didn't like the employees' attitude and how they treat customers
so if you are a kind of person who gets irritated by being served by snobish restaurant staff, maybe it's not a best place to go
The wrong bottle of wine finally showed up after about 40 minutes
After no service, it went to intrusive service with our appetizers being delivered essentially with our wine
No time to enjoy the wine
Then meal right after the aps
Everything was cold
Not to mention we had to fend off overzealous busboys who kept wanting to take away our unfinished food
Maybe the most over-rated restaurant I have ever wated $$ at
had been wanting to check this place out for some time - didn't dissapoint
Swanky surrounds which fit well with the phenomenal food
The black pork was exceptional as was the hen
Would throughly recomend but don't expect any change out of 100 per person
Worth spoiling yourself though
On my third visit to Craft, I am excited to say they are among the elite in delivering a superior overall experience in taste bud fun
The A la carte experience allows one to Craft their own commitment, from 2 courses to 4, generally
An abridged, but extremely smart wines by the glass menu (in addition to a generous bottle selection) makes pairing simple and on the mark
The casual but sage staff will guide one's way with interest and flexibility

Don't be shy when it comes to the toppings
My choice
rhe horseraddish/mayo combo
If you have never had them, then make it a must do on your list
The are to die for!
I was quite overwhelmed when I first saw the sauce menu (I was always a basic ketchup girl)


start with the standard mayo and branch out as you get more adventurous
I can't even remember if they serve anything else -- a busy hole in the wall sized place and atmosphere
I am addicted to Pommes Frites! They have, by far, the best fries in NYC
So many sauces to choose from! I highly recommend the Roasted Garlic Mayo
i don't even eat fries that often, but i was taken here on the way to eat BRUNCH and these fries were even good first thing in the morning
that has to say something!
I love the fries at Pommes Frites at St
Marks place - people are great and portion is wonderful
I also think all the different sauces are great choices
I would go from New Jersey for some when I get the hankering for some
There's a McDonald's, Burger King, and another burger place across the street from the bus stop
They all sell fries
I'm paying $10 just to get to the city to get these fries and back
i found the best thing in new york in this restuarant!!
If you like fries then you are in heaven here
A huge cone of fries coupled with your choice of sauces that range from the normal ketchup to the exotic Thai Chili War sauce
equals ecstasy
God, how I love Pommes Frites
With a small $3 cone big enough to split with a friend and still barely finish, so many delicious dips you'd have to come back every night for weeks on end to try them all, quick service, and an open-door beer policy, it's one of the best places in the city for a delicious snack (or not-particularly-healthy meal)
The fries are crispy and much tastier than any other fry shop I've found
The seating area is limited to a cramped area with a few hard benches and cone-holding tables in the back, but otherwise, no complaints!
The only bad thing about this place is how hard it is to choose only a few sauces
There is no better place to get deliciously hot and fresh fries than Pommes Frites! They have a plethora of sauces/dips/condiments, and it's so cheap! They offer free water too! It's just great! For about $4 you get this HUGE cone of piping-hot fries with your choice of s/d/c! GO!
Just got back from a euphoric experience at Pommes Frites
The fries were fresh and ever-so-hot, and my tastebuds were quite pleased with the different delightful sauces (a peanutty one, parmesan peppercorn, and good old fashioned ketchup

I never claimed to be classy
) These frites are delicious in every way
I'll be back to try the other delectable sauces
The tables are so utilitarian - holes provided to hold your order or fries - and free H2O is available
(But if it's beer you want, they have that, too
) Merci Dieu pour Pommes Frites!
I often go miles out of my way to the East Village purely to acquire these fries
When the craving hits, nothing else on earth will do
Pick any one of the dipping sauces, it doesn't even matter
These melt in your mouth piping hot beauties are worthy of any topping, even none at all
Pure delicious sin
Granted there is hardly anywhere to sit
Went there a few times so far, and I have to say these fries make McDonalds look like
McDonalds hamburgers
Pommes Frites fries really kick some butt, and I would recommend the Chutney Mayo, the super hot Salsa sauce, and the Roaster Garlic Mayo
Well done!
Love the fries here, especially with horseradish sauce
:) *drool* ;) Must limit self to one visit per month
well, that's my story and I'm sticking with it! :) Perfect meal on the way home from work and too hungry/tired to think about anything else
Just stand there, smell the fries cooking, ask for a soda to go along with it, and walk out munching happily, refreshed, restored, and humming a little tune of deep fried contentment
;)
Simply no better Belgian fries anywhere
Try the curried ketchup sauce
These fries were the best I ever eaten
The sweet mago sauce is to die for
Hard to find, but well worth the trip!
i hunted this place down, and by god, it was worth it
i love fries and this is what heaven is to me
the regular dip was amazing, but the mango chutney, oooooh baby
forget the diet, you'll come back just to try all the dipping sauces
they r number one for a reason after reading the review i decided i had to try out this place and when i did i was very happy AMAZING snack
The fries are perfect - crunch/toasty on the outside, soft inside while not giving off the impressesion that it was soaked in oil
The variety of sauces adds to the excitement of entering this cozy place - every time I go, the wonderful debate starts on which sauce to try out
The place is small, so you have to squeeze your way through, but the that particular ambience what partially attracts people
+ the service is excellend - very courteous people behind the counters
+ great for snacks
As a native New Yorker, it's hard to find a place to go (especially on a Thursday or Friday) to have a quiet drink and catch up with a friend
This is that place-- where the bartenders are friendly, the drinks are cheap, and you can usually get a seat
If only there were more places like it
Small-town friends visiting? Sure, they'll want to be overwhelmed by Times Square and intimidated by chi-chi restaurants--that's part of the deal
But if you want to kick back and catch up, try Shades of Green
Nice bartenders, sports on TV and an unpretentious after-work crowd tends to please out-of-their-element hometown friends and family who've spent the rest of their visit pretending to enjoy your favorite squid-ink pasta and $15 apple martinis
I always go to the downtown location which I love - the tajins are consistently delicious and the Monday evenings with the live music and all-you-can-eat buffet are a real deal at $17
95
I just tried the uptown location on 1st at 75th Street - same great food but the ambience is much more intimate and truly Moroccan
Great to now have a choice
This place had the worst food I've had in a long time
Food was completely bland (it seemed like the chef didn't believe in using salt and pepper)
Not only was it horrible tasting, but everything was extremely overpriced
Save your money, go somewhere else
Good food good environment, just not a happening bar crowd
This place needs to get a little more happening for drinks and it would be awesome
The atmosphere is beautiful-quite romantic
It is a tiny little place and due its size the service is great, the food is abundant, and very tasty
A fine menu of salads and soups that are just right can start you off
Then you can choose from one of their many great dishes whether its fish, pasta, pizza, or anti-pasta dishes
There is a fine wine and beverage list as well
I love this place
I lived in the East Village for 9 years and I got take-out from here at least 2-3 times a week
Where else can you get great, fresh Mexican food for under $10
I wish they'd open a location in Chelsea
Paquito's has something that some similar neighborhood Mexican delivery/takeout places don't: the asada burrito
It is seasoned nicely and it's big enough for 2 meals
I think I like the 1st Ave location better than the 28th St
one
I've scoured the city for good Mexican food for three years and now I can rest my weary head

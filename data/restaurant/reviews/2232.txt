Pretty busy, but a great place for good pizza
My wife and I happened upon this great restaurant on our last trip to New York a couple years ago
Unfortunately, we couldn't remember the name
Upon visiting again we set out on a mission to locate the restaurant and we actually found it
Point is, it made such an impression that we were able to find it in a city of 1000 pizza shops
Food and wait staff were excellent again
I will return everytime I am in the city
The pepperoni pizza, caesar salad, and bread are all delicious @ Angelos!!!! The service was a little slow, but the place was packed, and it looked like our waitress was the only one there? I would definently recommend this to people who enjoy thin crust pizzas!!
If you like thin crust pizza, this is it
Fresh, tasty toppings make this a winner
We recently spent a week in NYC and were so delighted with Angelos that we ate there twice! The brick oven pizza is the best we've ever eaten and the salads are large enough for two (and equally as good)
The service is outstanding!
I agree w/ everything Deannagail says above
You can zip in and out or linger, never a problem getting a table
Just good cheap thai food in an informal atmosphere, great before going to a show at Roseland
Decadant surroundings are unecessary at Little Bangkok
The food is made to order; you pick a base (meat, veggies, etc
), then choose the sauce
Plates arrive hot and fast, with little fanfare and servers so quiet you barely notice their presence
The prices are reasonable (generally under ten dollars), and the restaurant itself is rarely crowded
It's the kind of place where you can sit and linger without the staff giving you that hurry up, we need to go on a cigarette break look
The seafood pad thai is refeshing, laced with the flavors of lime, curry and other spices
My favorite is the basil noodles, a delightful dish that's perfect blend of sweet and spicy herbs, freshly made noodles, and sauteed peppers and onions
If you're looking for an extravagent dining experience, look elsewhere, but if you want good food, plain and simple, Little Bangkok's the place to go
i eat here 4-5x week
their dishes taste great and are really healthy in secret ways
for example, all their soups have the right balance of vegetables and healthy carbs and protein (for example, they use barley, lentils, beans) with lots of fiber
they know which combinations of vegetables taste good cuz they're experts at it (carrots and red onions are a great combination)
their carrot salad is insanely good, without any bad stuff (it's carrots, raisins, walnuts, apples, plus cottage cheese)
their health bread is also really good, it's thick slices of whole wheat
also, their house dressing is the best ever (it's ground up carrot, celery, olive oil, and other secret ingredients
during winter you get a free cup of soup with your salad
the indian waitstaff are gruff until they get to know you
then they're still gruff but in a nice way
Good dairy/vegetarian restaurant
It seems a little overpriced, in light of the portion sizes, even for a kosher place
However, since there's not much else kosher between 42 and 72, I rely on the Health Bar
Several choices appropriate for vegans
I like the grilled veggie pizza
Service very poor, very subjective
Expects high tips
notes down if you don't tip well and orders you not to come again
Visit this restaurant if you want a bad ending to your day
I don't know what FENIXSTAR was ranting about, but I had a wonderful lunch at this delightful Indian restaurant
The lamb curry, chicken curry, and vindaloo were DELICIOUS!! The Vindaloo is spicy so~~ beware~~ The rice was cooked just right~ and with the 50% off deal at lunch you can't go wrong!
Baluchi's does NOT represent Indian food
Korma, in all of it's forms, never EVER features fruit cocktail, yet this restaurant will try to pass it off in your sauce
Your request for white meat chicken will never be honoured nor will your food arrive hot
Even with the 50% off lunch special, it's a waste of money
Do yourself a favor, skip Baluchis and head to one of the kitschy Indians on 6th street
The food for lunch was really delicious, along with 50% off eat in
So you can't go wrong with the menu and the price
Definitely worth more than one visit
I can't wait to go back
I was a little weary of this place for two reasons: its a small chain, and the fact that it was pretty much empty when I went
Despite these two facts I found the food to be very good
The only complaint is the cracker they serve before dinner (sorry can't remember the name, roti maybe?) is a little too peppery
Otherwise the food and service were top notch, and the price is right
no one knows why baluchi is an italian name at an indian restaurant but all that aside, the rice is great here! any asian cuisine dependent on rice better have great rice and baluchi's is generously portioned, fresh-tasting, separated granules and flavourful on it's own
add in a main course which is likely rich and flavourful and you've got yourself a meal
chicken tikka masala is a popular fave-- creamy and not overly spicy-- but, if you want it hot just ask
50% off lunch makes if cheap enough to try once, but you'll get hooked
Incredible! The food was outstanding
You have to like spicy and if you do you will be blown away
The Waiter was so nice taking us thru the dinning experience and the atmosphere was awesome
Try the Barrah Kabab, Saawala, Makhani and the Keema
You will have a new favorite restaurant after eating there
Hidden away on 55th Street, just a few stores west of 5th Ave
, is a small cafe with a giraffe outside
Passersby are sure to think it's a deli, but a decadent meal at a reasonable price awaits inside
Their lobster bisque is perfect on a cold wintry day and the sandwiches are Carnegie in size quality, yet easy on the wallet
Don't leave without asking for catering menu
I've had them cater 5 dinners and each one of them has been better than the last!
The food is very good here for its price
This is one of my favorite places to dine at when I want something that feels like it was home cooked
The interior is small, which makes space limited
I wouldn't recommend this for large group dining, however, it makes for a good date establishment
The staff is extremely friendly although sometimes not attentive
this place should be way more crowded b/c it's very good! tried the place about 3 years ago, and it's continued to delight! food is definitely home cooked and tasty
note: service isn't very attentive (it's family run, i think) but they mean well
I grew up on my mother's fantastic Thai food, and have never found a restaurant that imitates her culinary flair better
Fantastic prices, cozy atmosphere, extensive vegetarian menu, and real homestyle Thai food
Sawadi!
I order takeout from this place alot and the food is good
Key is NEVER to request that anything be spicy - they will dump a big pile of crushed red pepper on it, making it inedible even for my iron stomach
Better to add spice yourself
They used to seal the food poorly so that it spilled on the way here, but they seem to have fixed that
Great food at a terrific price
One of the best values in the city
I would highly recommend this place to any who enjoy delicious Thai food
A nice diner with a verry good service and kitchen
We ever eat there, when we are in New York
Best wishes from Germany!
Upon the insisting of my friend Andrew I ordered and loved the BBQ chicken, Helen had a nice beef dish witu veggies
The servers here are the Chinese version of the famed Soup Nazi
Lines could be long but move quickly and you better know your order when you're about 3rd in line; otherwise, you'll be given a mean stare-down
It's no-nonsense and you have your choice of rice (white or fried) or lo mein as a base and about 20 toppings to choose from
Much better value than the sandwich places
For midtown, you can't beat the prices!
If you are dining in mid-town and have a discerning palate for Chinese food, then you want to avoid this restaurant

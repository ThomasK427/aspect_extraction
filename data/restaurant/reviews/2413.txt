This restaurant is a crowd pleaser
literally! I came here on a Friday night with 17 other people
The staff was extremely patient and accomodating despite the fact that our reservation was originally for 12 and then grew to 20 and then finally reduced to 18
I truly appreciate the waitstaff for their politeness and flexibility
We were seated in the back room which was perfect because we were away from the hustle and bustle of the main room
The food was also wonderful
I had the escargot appetizer and the mussels entree
Both were so delicious! What a chic and classy restaurant!
Since it was my birthday and restaurant week, my friends decided to splurge on me for dinner at Brasserie
Service was very prompt and I had the Vietnamese Kobe Steak Salad, the Hangar Steak with Rissotto, and the indulgent Brasserie Sundae
Everything was presented on white plates very elegantly as places of this calibre should
The only beef I had was the scrunched up seating like you have to be a thin supermodel to park your butt in
We were seated close to the bar also and the litany of F's and S's swear words from the suits brought in the declass factor
Otherwise it was fine with the innovative ambiance, vibe and chic Sex n the City appeal
However, no Supermodels spotted on the night we went
Probably they're at home having a tic-tac
I visited Brasserie with a friend and her mother and the food was delicious
We had steak frites and chocolate cake
They were delicious
The only problem was that our waitress was condescending when advising us on how well done our at meat  should be due to the cut of the meat
But I don't know if this is charcateristic of all of the waiters in the restaurant
Oh, and the decor was very hip
I went with a group of 8 for restaurant week
The food was beautifully presented, but many of the dishes were just mediocre (e
g
rock shrimp, poached salmon)
Their steak dish was fabulous though
The atmosphere and decour somewhat make up for all of that though
This is one of the coolest places to start the night in NYC
Go to the bar and ask for Tim He was one of the best bartenders in town
Ask for one of his recent concoctions
The drink and the food on the bar menu are awesome
We love to split the mussels and fries or the sushi
The bar also has unique entertainment
As you walk in your picture is plastered on one of many digital screens
Loud, fun, great food, great drinks, outstanding bar service
What else can you ask for??? (One Hint: Stay at the bar!)
This place is ideal for someone who likes a crowd because it's quite loud here
Definitely would not come here for a quiet business deal
The food is really good, the service is thorough, but can be a little slow when it gets really busy
I'm a huge fan of fabulous decor and this venue definitely delivers
If you're a fan of interesting bathrooms, check this one out
If you're a fan of homemade ice cream/gelato, definitely check that out too!
the food itself was great although the portions are a bit small (but this is a good thing for us weight watchers!), although being very busy we were attended well, cool decor
Wonderful place! Service is devine, food is exceptional
They were even willing to make an impromtu appetizer on the spot
Will go again!
My husband and I went for restaurant week and had a great time, definitely good value for the price, but I'd be willing to pay more
The food was perfectly done, the presentation was lovely, and the service excellent
I recommend the pan seared red snapper and the salmon tartar, but the whole menu looks great
Anyone would love this place - the menu is so diverse, any type of taste will be satisfied
It is rare to find a place where both the seafood and the meat are as top-notch as this
The service and decor are immaculate
I will attend again and again!
My girlfriends and I came upon this fantastic lunchspot after a day of shopping while on vacation in NY
From the outside entrance, you would never know that such a unique dining room lay inside
From the television screens above the bar that snap a picture of guests as they walk in
to the comfortable Nancy Sinatra white leather chairs , the ambience is futuristic but fun
And the food was dynamite! The french onion soup is to die for and the crab cakes were scrumptious
From the moment we walked in, the staff was completely friendly
Especially our server, a shorter guy with Buddy Holly glasses
His quirkiness and sense of humor added to our whole experience
The only negative is that the room we were sitting in seemed much warmer than the main dining room where we entered
But overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone
Fab restaurant
staff really friendly
food gorgeous and general ambience is really buzzy!
The Plateau de Fruits de Mer is among the best I've had in the U
S
The Steak Frites is excellent, though, for this dish, I don't favor the cut on offer (a strip, I believe)
Fair wine list, fairly-priced, a fine bar
Like so many restaurants, it is far too noisy
In all, if you need a meal in the area, you can't go wrong in choosing Brasserie
As always, I loved it!! Looking for something different, our server recommended a seafood platter (a Plateau I think it was called)
Not only was it gorgeous, but totally fantastic
An assortment of mussels, clams, oysters, shrimp, crabmeat, ceviche, and lobster
WOW is the best way to describe it
We had a delicious bottle of Pinot Gris to accompany this seafood extravaganza
For the main course, I had the salmon and my friend had the filet caf de paris
Both melted in our mouths
And who can forget dessert not me
They are featuring a summer melon medley sooo light and refreshing
You cant go wrong
The Brasserie always has amazing food and friendly service, a difficult combo to find in NYC
Interesting combo of Japanese sushi and French entrees and desserts
No valet parking and the runway entrance was not such a big deal
The place was quite noisy and the tables are small
Perhaps tablecloths and heavy carpeting may provide some noise attenuation
Service was good and the desserts are excellent
Food was fresh the the fake French accent didn't add much
We used the Restaurant Associates $50 birthday gift certificate - and we enjoyed a fabulous meal! The Rib - eye melted in your mouth and the crabcakes were delicious
They make a great Caipirinha too
I will definitely recommend this restaurant, and will be back
We have been to Brasserie a few times, always with a Restaurant Associates coupon for $30-$50 off
With this coupon, it is very well worth it
Food is pretty decent, and ambiance is cool and unique
Definitely recommended

I have been wanting to go to Brasserie since it re-opened but could never find the time (or desire) to get to midtown east

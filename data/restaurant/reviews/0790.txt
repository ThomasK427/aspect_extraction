and I reommend to making resevations if you dont want to miss the show
you will not be disapointed if you have dinner in blue chili
the food is the best
I like pad thai shrimp and shrimp tempura roll ,for dessert just try banana rum
you can enjoy dinner because they don't rush you like some restuarant
and the waitres were friendly
Great little find in the theatre district
service was thorough and nice, and the sushi is beautifully presented and delicious
Hypercolor atmosphere provides a great cool ambience
A great addition to Midtown West, given the lack of decent sushi spots
The decor of Bluechili is cool trendy
The bar countertop make of acrylic panels were back lit with colorful lights changing and creating many different moods
The staff was very friendly and gave us 2 apertizers on the house to welcome us
The food were very flavorful and unique definitely fusion
The grilled chilean sea bass was so moist juicy and the duck tarmarind sauce was crispy spicy
But I would avoid the sirloin steak
To finish it off, we got mini creme brulees on the house again
Will definitely go back next time
Had a great evening at Bluechili
The food was fantastic and it was not too expensive
The wait staff was helpful with suggestions and never rushed us
It's a chic place, so go before the word gets out
I love sushi
I love Bluechili
The food is also great such as grilled chilean sea bass and duck tangarine
this place is art deco - very modern, very professional
other pan asian eateries will now have to compete with this new entry
the food/sushi is well prepared
svc
is very good
try the various rolls
ask for their specials
SUM IT: you should try it a least once
i would recommend over the blue fin or hakata grill
not traditional japanese but still good
judge for yourself though
Our waiter was so friendly and helpful
The sushi rolls and tuna tartare were fabulous, as were the complimentary bread and unique and tasty dips (wish there were more!)
My ice-blue vodka drink was delicious and different
For a new restaurant we were very impressed
Great location for an early, after-work dinner also
The food was superb and the service was even better
The restaurant has a modern look with remarkable tables and bar
you have to check it out for yourself! the food isnt expensive and definately worth every penny
After reading the reviews on this site, I thought twice about bringing my family to this place but was absolutely delighted that I went
Our 11 member group had an excellent meal and our server was very attentive
The restaurant was not full but it had a respectable crowd and the food came quickly, freshly prepared, well-presented and hot
No issues at all with service
The food was excellent as well and everyone -- to a person -- enjoyed their meal
Maison has issues
I had dinner there, quite late - I was one of 4 patrons in the restaurant
That's one waiter for every table, non?  Non
Servers kept flitting about, delivering SLLLLLOOOOOWWWW service
The food is average - my expectations were already low because of the location
The saving grace - I was seated by the door and could turn around to interrupt whatever they were doing to ask for what I needed
My advice - brunch may be OK, and a late, late dinner OK too - but keep your expectations low and don't go for the priciest thing on the menu
Stick to the cheap stuff and you will not feel left out
This is the epitomy of Times Square
FOOD BELOW AVERAGE and HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I like the outdoor space they have, however last time I was there, pasta was really bad, I got my food after my companion was done eating
I had to wait for almost half hour before I got my credit card back
We stopped by because of the patio overlooking time square
What a place to have a drink or two ! The french food was ok we had a steak and ceasar salad
The food needs to be much better because there is better french food around that is for sure
Wonderful spot for salad and a beer

My husband and i recently moved to the city from atlanta GA
We recently ate lunch at maison on 53rd and 7th Ave, and had a wonderful time
Our waiter (a southerner himself) was charming and prompt
The food was well above average
Even the people removing our plates did so in a polite manner
Sit outside and smoke, try the grilled brie
Our waiter was incompetent and spoke very little English; the service was so slow we ended up having to get our order to-go
The couple next to us said that the last time they were there they had to leave without paying the bill because no one would take their check for over an hour (I wondered why they came back
)
Seriously, a half-hour for a single dish when we told them we were in a hurry and the waiter said it would take ten minutes is UNACCEPTABLE
It is also unacceptable to pretend to know what customers are saying when you don't have a clue
When my to-go order was haphazardly presented to me without any of the extra things I would have gotten if I had stayed in (like dressing, for example), it then was turned into my fault and the waiter said 'ask kitchen if no like
It so sad that the service is so horrible
My first experience - a Sunday brunch - was very fantastic
However, as I live around the corner, everytime I've gone back since has been absolutely horrible
The food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at Maison
Such a shame
Come for brunch (especially if you're a smoker - the only restaurant I know of in NYC that still has a smoking section) but don't bring any high expectations and be prepared to wait
I entered this restaurant with little or no expectations, but i was so pleasently surprised
The food was exceptional, I had the Steak Frites, cooked to a perfect medium and the frites were crispy and flavourfull
But what really made the experience was the wonderful staff
Very involved with every aspect of my experience
Even the manager stopped by to offer me a warm smile and to make sure everything was in order
The waitress was so helpfull and really a delight, I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND this establishment to friends and family
Stoped by this place by accident, never really noticed it before, but wow, was I in for a great suprise
I had a steak au poivre with a side of frites of course
A chimay reserve followed by a banana crepe, just awesome
The service was great and friendly
Really a great experience overall
I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year
What a difference, the service was very comforting and the food was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list
I am a beer lover and this list, was well thought covering pretty much everything
Very nice touch that very much fits the place

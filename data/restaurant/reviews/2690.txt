I love this place
YOU SHOULD UPDATE THE REVIEWS, THIS PLACE IS NO LONGER WHAT IT USED TO BE
EXPENSIVE, BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE
YOUR RESTAURANTS REVIEWS ARE OUTDATED
FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE RECENT COMMENTS ON YOUR LISTED RESTAURANTS
I was told about this place in Astoria that serves fresh grilled fish and because i live in Manhattan i had no clue how to get there
I called and from the telephone i could tell how friendly the place would be, they gave me great direction, and i was there in 25 minutes
I was impressed by the size of the order, because for those who eat out in Manhattan, you know what i am talking about
A small salad is a large salad and a large salad is falily size salad
Telly's has the best octopus ever and the fish was so good on the grill
At the end i was expecting my bill and suddenly this plate full with little honeyballs landed on my table
Loukoumades and IT WAS ON THE HOUSE
so overall tellys is the place to go only 20-25 minutes from the city
I went back to telly's because i heard that they changed the Chef and the food was again, after a very very small break, was excellent again
So i went with my friends on a saturday night which is the crash test for Telly's for those who know the place
I enjoyed everything from the huge salad that they offer for 4 persons, but easily 6 can enjoy it, to my grill octopus, the fried calamari, and finally my grilled fish, that wasn't dry at all
Therefore for those that were dissapointed by Telly's for a while suggest that you go back
And of course Nana will be waiting at the door for you
Who makes up tTelly's Taverna clientele? The answer is in the variety of languages floating in the air
Besides Greek and English, the voices talking and laughing in the busy, light filled space are speaking Hebrew, Spanish, Italian
Nana the owner has learned enough Hebrew to discuss her menu in Hebrew with her Israeli clientele
She has traveled to Israel with clients who are also friends, and seen first hand the similarities and differences between the cuisines
After all, fresh fish, vegetables and fruits in season, olive oil, lemon and oregano are ingredients readily available on the Mediterranean
Excellent food superbly prepared is excellent food after all
And besides, Nana is there to greet you!
If you want to have fresh grill fish served just with virgin olive oil and lemon Telly's Taverna is the place for you
My wife and i leave in the city on the upper west side and we enjoy going to Telly's every week
There was a period that things weren't the same but Nana always knows how to fix things especially the food
I must say that the orders are much bigger than they used to be and the prices are the same and in some cases i would say lower than before
We highly reccomend it to everyone and it's just 20 minutes from manhattan and it has 20 times lower prices than manhattan
We chose this place based on the recommendations on this website and on Zagat
We had to try the grilled fish since Zagat raved about it
The experience was disappointing
The fish was bland and dry due to over grilling
The service was unacceptable
We waited almost 2 hours for our food
Our waiter, though he was charming,was too busy to truly take care of us properly and the food was over priced
Although the chicken and octupus were good, Telly's is not a place I would return to or recommend to anyone
I hadnt been to this resteraunt in a couple of years ( since the renovation) because then, seating was limited and the wait was long
This evening was better than a night in Greece!! Telly's food was amazing, The resteraunt is 3 times the size, the outdoor seating was great
The service was very good and all together a great experience! Since Tellys many have tried to compete with thier fish but after tonight it is my opinion that they are still far behind!
We were so satisfied!!!!! The food was very good
The fish case was full of VERY fresh fish, grilled to order
Our waitress was extremely warm and friendly
They recenly expanded their Dining room and the atmosphere was great
I would highly recomend Telly's Taverna
Try the kafterie if you like something a little spicy
They do also have meat dishes that are great
Have fun!
This place was Ok, prices were very reasonable but the food wasn't that good
My wife and I ordered Lamb Chops that were kind of tough and not very tasty
The more you eat here the better it gets
dips, lamd shops, beans, fresh fish
its a marvelous place
the staff is outstanding
the best of all is grilled shrimp and octupus
Enjoy
This restaurant was my first venture into Astoria
I have since been to many other restaurants in Astoria
but Telly's is definitely the best
the garden room in the back is very nice
Food was excellent! Grilled octopus was sublime! The complimentary desssert with the Greek coffee knocked my socks off! I love it here!
I love coming here with a small group b/c the saganaki is best eaten quickly, while still hot
The atmosphere here is totally casual and neighborhoody
Newbies are, however, often disconcerted by the loud trains rumbling by until they, too, get lost in the food
Telly's makes the best grilled octopus in town, although, sadly, the portions seem to be shrinking
However, I'm stuck b/c I can't eat octopus anywhere else in the city now that I've been spoiled by this place's tender and perfectly prepared rendition
On this last visit, our saganaki, octopus and Greek salad were wonderful, as usual
I don't even bother getting fish here anymore (who wants to deal with those bones?) and am content with a dinner of just the grilled tentacles and salad
and maybe saganaki when there are enough people to help eat it
Great for tapas and drinks
It is cheap but the food is fresh and delicious
It's a quiet crowd but if you just want to relax, get a bottle of wine and some great tapas, this is the place
I wouldn't recommend entrees
Too expensive and not as yummy as their tapas!
Friendly staff, excellent food, reasonable prices, how could you not give this place a good review!
My family and I have been dining at this restaurant since they opened here in Astoria
The food and service has always been great
When family comes in from out of state this is where I take them and I have never been disappointed
my friend took me here for my birthday
we started with fried calamari, as an entree, i choose the chicken rice (with spanish sausage)
the quantity was such that i couldnt eat it all and had to doggie bag the rest
my friend had the filet mignon, not quite spanish but it was good
the spanish fried potatoes that came with her entree was really good
we got a small pitcher of sangria, it was totally delicious
my friend said the place gets packed for dinner
however, we went for lunch and were the only ones eating there and yet the service seemed eager for us to be done and to get out
The people who posted the reviews below mine should go eat at Taco Bell or better yet maybe they would better off at one of those taco trucks on Roosevelt Avenue because it sounds like they came to El Olivo with Mexican food in mind- or maybe some cheap seafood
El Olivo is a Spanish restaurant! Spanyards eat tapas, not salsa
Apparently the person who made the Delmonte comment never ate tapas
The seafood is out of this world and priced accordingly
Let me start by saying the two great reviews for this place must be written by the owner and the owner's mom
When I had dinner here Friday night I thought I was in the wrong place
I recently took a trip to Spain and not once was I served Italian bread and a house salad with my meal
The salsa in Keyfood tops the salsa in this place
The main meal, a red snapper, was not bad, but after hoping I would experience a true spanish experience, the remaining dinner lost its appeal
To finish, the cost of the dinner was over-priced
I do not recommend for the true spanish lovers
Let's start with the salsa: It's like warm and spicy Delmonte sauce - almost like ketchup
The sangria: At $23 a pitcher it's no bargin

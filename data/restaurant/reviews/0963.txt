Go check it out!
i was taken there on a date and when i was told we were going to have mexican in new york i was a little worried
however, the food was great
I recommend the chicken dish with green rice, plantain and guacamole
the enchiladas were great and the drinks were refreshing with good quality tequila
don't expect the drinks to be inexpensive but they are worth it and accompany the food well
i would not recommend the dessert for the size and the price
the music selection was a little off, since there is better latin music out there that is from mexico
Cinco de Mayo at Zona Rosa was probably one of the best times I've ever had in any restaurant in NYC period!!! The place was packed when we arrived so understandably we had to wait a bit
Once drinks were in-hand we ordered some amazing guacamole and chips which were heavenly
I ordered a seabass wrapped up in a leaf! Ten kinds of excellent
Yeah, we had to wait for our server to get our orders
Big deal
We were too busy having fun to care! When Mexican food is this good, IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!
I searched this site for the best Mexican restaurants in New York and decided that Zona Rosa had the best authentic Mexican food
I went to dinner there and was very happy to find that the food was delicious (I had the Tilapia Fish) and the service was outstanding
I couldn't have found better service
The atmosphere was relaxed and the wait staff was very attentive and helpful with recommending some items on the menu
Next time I feel like real authentic Mexican Food
Zona Rosa's will be the first place I will go
If you are looking for the best Mexican dinner and a place to impress
I would totally recommend this restaurant
Having eaten here several times I cannot emphasize enough how consistantly creative and delicious the food is
If you are looking for Tex-Mex this is not the right place for you, but if fresh and tantalizing truly Mexican dishes are what you crave, then this is the place! The crusted mahi mahi with lobster and sweet potatoes was delicious
and those guava cookie bars, yum
Everyone is always friendly, thanks, we'll be back
The food was ok, the drinks service were AWFUL!! The margaritas tasted like they came out of a week's old pitcher of margaritas
My friend ordered a mango margarita which was just okay and when she decided to try again she got a completely different drink, yet they kept insisting it was mango
Finally we just sent our drinks back and ordered some safe bottled beers
THE SERVICE- we had a reservation, they took forever to seat us and when they did we didn't see a waiter for about 15 minutes and he acted as if we were at some drive thru, rushing us and then ignoring our table (actually we hardly saw him at all) throughout the night
They gave us desert menus but never came back for a desert order, instead we had to ask for the check and a bus boy retreived it for us
-D
As a mexicana in NY, I personally love this restaurant because authentic Mexican food (ie
tacos) is hard to find, whereas there is an abundance of gourmet mexican restaurants everywhere
This one is by far my favorite
The flavors are true to what Mexican food is, the service is consistently great and the prices are reasonable
I was amused by the reviewer who was disappointed he didn't get bread - this just doesn't happen at a true Mexican restaurant
Instead, he got cucumbers and jicama, an authentic Mexican fruit and appetizer
I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience a true Mexican Gourmet dining experience
All the Mexicans I know have never left disappointed
A friend and I went to Zona Rosa's for dinner and I wasn't very impressed
The guacamole was only slightly above average and the spinach and cheese quesdadillas weren't anything special
The only compliments I can give this restaurant are the excellent service (the staff was very attentive) and the two glasses of Merlot I ordered
Other than that, I doubt I'll be going back
I recently held a corporate event for about 40 people at Zona Rosa
It was a huge success
The food was great, especially the Shrimp skewers
The service was first-rate and the bar tenders were very personable
The music also kept things interesting
It was very reasonably priced for the high-quality of food and drinks
Management at Zona Rosa was very easy to work with in planning this event on very short notice
The extensive tequila selection made the later part of the evening fun and interesting
Zona Rosa is a good change of pace from your typical loungey restaurants
Went to Zona Rosa with a large group (10+) and we were all disappointed
The place is worn down -do not be fooled by website
They had limited beer menu; the drinks were aweful
The food was ok, but the portions were ridiculously small and thus way overpriced
I definitely do not recommend this place for large groups
You will leave ready to eat again
$11 for 2 miniture quesadillas!!! Are you kidding me??? And what ever happened to serving bread before dinner
Instead they serve some weird vegetable and a sliced cucumber
Terrible!!!! If you are looking for authentic mexican cuisine, this is not the place
We had dinner there on Saturday, the place came highly recommended and indeed it was superb
Sometimes you expect Mexican food to be good and simple but here it was great and complex
The black bean soup was dense and you get a tingly heat with each spoonful
The quesadillas are just delicious
Try the Sirloin, it comes with tortilla chips cooked in a green sauce, this was my favorite dish
The salmon with black rice and seafood is very good
Service was very attentive and friendly, quick to respond to our requests
I don't know about the hidden prices mention on one of the reviews, all of the prices are on the menu; according to my guests you get what you pay for, and we feel it was worth more of what we pay for
I loved this restaurant until the bill came
They did everything they could to squeeze more money out of us
Watch what you order and what they offer you
The appertizer platter that the chef makes for big groups is ridiculously expensive
Be careful!
I went with a bunch of friends to celebrate my birthday in this restaurant after reading good reviews on this website
Unfortunately we had a terrible experience
Although the food was reasonable, the service was shocking
The food took a good 45 minutes to appear from the kitchen for a group of seven
When we pointed this out the head waitress ignored us, and on saying that we did not think we should pay the service, she was incredibly rude and offensive
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
I went to zona rosa for a very special dinner with a few friends and wat a surprise
the food was out of this world the red snapper was lite and full of flavour
and the tostados was a dish I will keep going back for
My guest had scallop app
it was lite and refreshing and the pumkinseed crust of the mai mai with lobster I am still thinking about it
any one who is looking for a great meal not to pricey this is the place you should try
Great food, great people, awsome location everone musy go here even if just for drinks and appetizers or drinks and dinner : )
Great mexican food, not too expensive
Very nice atmosphere and it was so romantic
I enjoyed every second
In the last 10 years (since moving from the west coast) I've found the available Mexican food options to be pretty pathetic
Zona Rosa is the first Mexican restaurant I've found out here that meets and exceeds my expectations
Not only is the food fresh and perfectly prepared, but it is creative and masterfully prepared
I'm almost giddy
Many times when someone mentions a tipe of food, we automaticly think of what we already know
Adrian's cooking is a window to the old Mexican food, which is compare with French food, laborious, sophisticated, and passionate
Forget about the chimichangas, burritos and all that cheap food that we Americans are used to eat, level up a bit and experience fine Mexican Dining
And the thrue ritual of Tequila
Small sips of tequila help you appreciate better a drink, rather then shotting them

These bagels are excellent - doughy, and both better and cheaper than HH
The staff at Absolute will always recommend the freshest, just-baked, hot out of the oven bagels or else slip a cool one back in the oven upon request
They have an awesome selection of tofutti cream cheeses, which you can get on the side
Plus, the iced and regular coffee is great
The hours are convenient and the price is right; what more could you want from a bagel shop?!
Good bagels - cheap compared to HH, variety of cream cheeses, mini-muffins, decent NY coffee, rapid service, and sitting room
Family place
Even made a pizza bagel on demand for my 5 year old! Fellow chinese-canadian
For a bagel purist, these bagels might at first sight seem a little on the large side and perhaps pumpernickle raisin and whole wheat sesame are non-traditional
But don't be fooled--these are seriously good chewing bagels
They are also fresh
I am often dumbfounded at on-site bagel bakeries that don't circulate their stock properly
If you go into Absolute in the morning, you are sure to have several hot varieties to choose from and many warm
And, though I take my bagels seriously, both the whole wheat sesame and pumpernickel raising are worthy additions to bageldom
I have eaten here several times now- my friends really like the place, so I've tried different things each time thinking that maybe I've just ordered 'the wrong thing'
After 3 lunchtime visits I have to report that their wraps are soggy; their grilled panini bland; and their salads just ordinary (not to mention the curt person behind the counter who mixed my salad)
Having said all that, I will confess that they make delicious cookies, yummy rice crispy treats and excellent bread
Try it for breakfast or dessert, but eat lunch somewhere else
these bagels are so good
the best i've had anywhere
Everytime Im on the UWS i have to get some Lenny's Bagels
Best bagels i've ever had
So many fillings available
But the best part is the cream cheese, very creamy!
Although it smells like it should be a decent place, don't let your olfactory system fool you! Everything is COVERED in cilantro
Their version of chicken tikka masala tastes nothing like what it should- it's basically chunks of chicken with stewed tomatoes, and of course, half of the dish is cilantro
Even the mango lassies are bad! They taste like diluted yogurt with a hint of mango
Save your money - you're better off microwaving a frozen indian tv dinner
On a side street between Broadway and Amsterdam, this cozy, small restaurant really does it right with its nice range of good quality sushi, noodle soup and tempura
The newer, much more expensive sushi places nearby on Amsterdam don't offer anything better
This place was recommended by a friend and i came, i had a wonderful time
The service was great ,the food was delicious and well presented
Mr Thomas and Ms Maude went out of their way to make my evening enjoyable
Perfect for a quiet night with a friend
I would recommend it to anyone
this was my second visit to hunan park, and the food is always very fresh and tasty
I will remember this place for future reviews!
I've discovered this quaint little restaurant after a stroll from a concert in Central Park
The dishes were amazing, they were better than any I've eaten in Chinatown
The prices were very fair
NO complaints, hands down, the BEST !
HAS THE BEST FOOD, GREAT SERVICE
WILL HAVE YOU LEAVING THE PLACE WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE FOR MANY REASONS
Overall, the food and service is very good
Definately the best Chinese food in the area
The Scene  While the food holds some interesting surprises, Alouette's tidy bi-level setting is typical bistro: wood floors, butter-yellow walls, framed French posters, red velvet drapes, lace curtains and mirrors that add the illusion of more space
Unlike other moderately priced bistros though, the cooking here is truly professional
The Food  The chef's knack for extracting complementary flavors is evidenced in his sauteed shrimp with cannellini beans, a simple effort bursting with garlic and rosemary undertones
Another impressive starter is the warm poached salmon: a thin fillet speckled with olive oil, lemon juice, diced tomatoes and shredded mint
Of the 10 entrees, half are seafood, but the chef is equally comfortable with beef
A lean sirloin steak is superb: tender, expertly grilled to order and softened by a red wine and shallot sauce
Desserts are dainty
food wasn't even good
below average
and the service was even worse
unheard of in NYC
our wine was corked
not only the smell and the color but the obvious moldy defected cork
the typical french owner was unbearably arrogant
insisting that nothing wrong with the wine
She think everybody is stupid enough to drink that corked wine???she should learn that 6% of wine has corkage problem and that is a part of the business
Also if the food is not excetional,they should try to improve their service
Don't go there,there are so many nice restyaurents with good food and service in new yorkcity! very bad experience
I won't go back ever again!
Alouette lost our reservation and called my wife a liar when she insisted we made one
We walked out
The rudest treatment I've ever experienced in NYC
We've eaten there before and it was ok
This is a great place with good food, very reasonable prices, and warm, attentive service
Be sure to try the duck confit salad and the short ribs - and of course the chocolate gateau
I've been to Alouette twice and I had the Prix fixe dinner each time
For about $20, I got an appetizer, main and dessert
Unheard of for French cuisine! The ambience is very romantic and I was not disappointed with the food
I would definitely go back
The service is very good, gracious and just attentive enough
The space is simple, predictable, familiar and very bistro
No pretentions, which is very welcome
The food, however, fails
Alouette churns out some of the warhorses of bistro-fare, and attempts a few side-steps as well, which is admirable, but there is something in the execution and ingredients that makes a grilled steak underwhelming, the gaufrettes bland, the escargots timid and hidden, the duck like the steak, the deserts bland and unispired
Shame, they could easily do better
Prices are very reasonable for an UWS bistro, and the space is ready for some fine cooking, but you can easily find much better fare elsewhere
Bland
That describes the place, and the food
we were seated in the 2nd floor dining room which lacks character and warmth
First floor dining room is not much of a cozy or warm place but definitely better than the 2nd floor area
Service was ok
We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly
The food was the biggest disappointment
The duck and sirloin steak were well, bland
The duck dish was even cold
peolple sitting at the nearby table seemed happy with their food I should add
By the way, at the end of the night we noticed they had forgotten to being us bread etc at the begining
The only good thing we had was a $38 Point noir from central coast
The food was such a disappointment
Very pleasant atmosphere
Impecable service
Very good food
Somewhat pricey, but overall, would recommend
Unpretentious, but classy, environment where food has imaginative preparation and presentation and is of predictable quality
Have never been disappointed

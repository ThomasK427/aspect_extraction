Go to Republic at half the price and be content
If more than one person in your party orders from the Restaurant Week menu, you are expected to share entrees and dessert! For example, for a party of 2, you get two appetizers, one entree, and one dessert
Makes you embarrassed to eat there, because it's obvious to everyone there that you're ordering from the cheap menu
Ridiculous
The flourescent pink lemonade was $4
50, which wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't tasted like concentrated syrup
If a restaurant doesn't wish to provide the same quality of food and service to Restaurant Week patrons as the regular people that go there, they should not participate in the program
I have been to China Grill numerous times and it never fails to please me and my group
The duck salad is amazing, and the Bananas In A Box dessert is unbelieveable (if you like bananas)
The food is consistently good
The food comes out as it's ready, so you can be waiting for a meal for a while and others are already done
Portions are large and can be shared or taken home
Service can be hit or miss but definitely recommend it for large groups - it's noisy but fun
unless you're on an expense account, or like inconsistent expensive food, dont go here
the service is thin, the drinks so-so, and the place is screaming loud
$19
50 for three scallops should never happen
the best thing is the atmosphere, but even that is overshadowed by the lack of taste and originality in the food
a better option is le colonial
This is a nice place with excellent asian-fusion food (combination of japanese thai)
The atmosphere is anti-cozy and cold
The service is very average
We spend the New Year's eve at China Grill in 2003 and paid $400 per couple
The parking is expensive
My parents were in town, and their hotel was near China Grill, so we stopped in for dinner
The prices were outrageous, but we assumed the quality would be commensurate, so we ordered
The food would have been disappointing for half the price- for what we paid it was simply a rip-off
Our server was inattentive and, once she realized my parents were tourists, she was nowhere to be found
She dropped the check when we were half way through dessert, which is just rude
There are so many great restaurants in New York, don't waste your money here
Upon entering, I was impressed by the room while the food on other peoples' tables seemed enticing
Our waiter (the one with the Spanish accent) was a bit pre-occupied with other things- hardly coming around to the table and nowhere to be seen most of the time
Not attentive or thorough at all
he would run away once one person asked for a glass of water and wouldn't bother taking anyone else's order
In between the main course and dessert, it was awhile until he approached us
We had to be the ones to mention ordering dessert! All in all, enjoyed the food- great lamb and beef! The scallop appetizer was amazing
The menu was a bit too pricey considering the bad service
If you want a good overall experience with this type of cuisine- ambiance, service, food- your better off at Asia de Cuba
I've only been to China Grill for the first time today during lunch hour
For a first timer's experience, the food really good and the staff was pretty attentive
(Try the pecking duck salad, which is fit for two -- absolute perfection!) A little on the pricey side, however
Then again, it IS midtown Manhattan
My friend Annie and I last dined at China Grill 3 years ago and dubbed it one of our favorite restaurants in the city
We decided to revisit it, but unfortunately we were quite disappointed with the cuisine
We ordered the lobster pancakes (which had more mushrooms than lobster), crispy calamari salad (we think they forgot to add the dressing as it was quite bitter), Rack of Lamb (they did forget the sauce and came back when they realized it), vegetable fried rice, and the Great Wall for dessert
The dining experience was nothing too spectacular, especially after paying a hefty tab of $150
Next time, we're going to Blue fin, Annie!!!
China Grill has a few good dishes
I am a fan of the seared tuna, and the risotto/veal dish
The crispy spinach side dish is great
The Asian Fruit Tower is one of the BEST DESSERTS I think I have ever eaten
I would recommend going to China Grill just to get one
Good restaurent but I would choose Mr Chows over it
My friend and I were debating
Where to go for restaurant week, and which would fit the following criteria: 1) Somewhere accesible through the OpenTable
com online reservations service, and 2) a restaurant we'd never been to before
Well, since we're avid diners, that narrowed it down to one place: China Grill, that bastion of yuppie-dom
We braced ourselves for the worst, and it seemed to be coming to fruition: loud, obnoxious crowd; deafening rock music; flighty staff; and a 45 minute wait WITH a reservation
But surprise, surprise: after enduring the above, the food was actually very good, and the portions were HUGE--and all for $30
02 per person
Would I go back again? Maybe not when I'd have to spring for $30 an entree at this joint, but for Restaurant Week, it ultimately redeemed itself
Went with 2 friends for lunch during Restaurant Week
Since the prce was fixed at $20
03 I can't comment on if it was expensive, but I will say that if the portions are as big on the regular menu then it is probably worth it
The 2 salads were gigantic and very fresh
They gave 3 of us enough pasta for 5 people and we still had another entree
We took home 5 chinese food cartons filled with leftovers
Not classic chinese but delicious asian fusion
I can't wait to go back and order off the regular menu
Having eaten at China Grill and being treated with exceptional courtesy, friendliness, professionalism, and eating some of the most delicious food ever, we are headed back on the January 11th for more of the same
The overseer of the restaurant is exceptional at his job
It doesn't get much better than China Grill
A bit too price for what you're really getting
Don't let the name fool you, this is not chinese food
Appetizer portions are same size as entree
Dessert was spectacular
Overall, not worth the high price
We ate at China Grill last night for my sister's birthday
Big mistake
We had an 8:30 reservation, they did not seat us until 9:20
They were not even apologetic
Then the waitress did not offer any concession even though we were obviously starving
We tried to get in an appetizer order right away and she informed us that the chef prefers that we order all at once
The food did come out quickly and was good, but not worth the prices or the wait
Then after we had already ordered dessert and were full, they brought out another dessert on the house as an apology for our wait
Gee thanks, after we were full
They should have just taken the appetizers off the bill
Will NOT go back!
This place was fantastic
The food was inventive and the flavors BURST in your mouth
Try the tempura sushi -- out of this world
As was teh marinated soy steak and lobster mashed potatoes
The atmosphere was energetic and sexy
Music was great to groove to
Service was impeccable and attentive
This restaurant knows how to run a business
Expect great service, creative food, sexy ambiance you'll still be unprepared for the best restaurant GM in NYC
She's watching your table, helping the staff candy to your eyes
She made a good night great!
Great experience, splendid athmosphere and food

The food was disappointing though
We all got something different and I can't say that I was very impressed considering the cost
I got the chocolate etc
ribs and they were good, but slightly overcooked
The entree steak was very rough, very dry, and extremely chewy even though I ordered it Medium Rare
I had a good experience, but mostly because of the atmosphere and the private room not because of the food
The coat check was full? The hostess sat us down in a booth
After our waitress brought us menus took our drink orders, a diff hostess came over asked us to give up our table
We told her no
After a discussion in the corner between the 2 hostesses a man, the same hostess came back told us we had to get up and sit in the original assigned table because they had 8 people waiting for this table
She did not care that we couldn't fit at the table or that it was blocking the exit door
She insisted that the computer says it seats 3
We asked the man if he was the manager or owner was told whatever
I went to the Cub Room for the first time with my girlfriends this past week for Restauarant Week
The place was packed when we got there and we did have to wait a bit, but the wait was more than made up for by the excellent bar scene: delicious cocktails (I reccommend the Chinatown!), hot bartenders, and an excellent mix of people mingling and hanging out
Good mix of music as well
When we were seated for dinner, the staff was more than apologetic for the wait and provided excellent service throughout the meal
Very knowledgeable server, great food (quite the opposite from the previous review, the temperature and taste on our dishes were great), and swanky ambience
All in all, a great place to spend a chic soho evening, excellent meal and after-dinner drink scene in one spot!
My boyfriend I went for restaurant week
The hostess instructed to sit at the bar for 10 minutes for a table
After 30 minutes, someone came over, apologized for the wait, and sat us at a beautiful table
We ordered another round of drinks and 20 minutes later were waited on
15 minutes later the appetizers arrived (mine was warm and bland, his was tasty but cold)
We sent the cold food back it came back cold again
Dinner took another 30 minutes- mine was tasty but cold, his was hot and OK
We complained to the servers- they smiled, said they would let the kitchen know, and continually asked if we wanted more drinks
We were still waiting for dessert twenty minutes later
We spent $130 and we were annoyed and tired after the 2 hr ordeal
I went to Soho to do some holiday shopping with a group of friends, we happened to stop by the Cub Room
The food was fantastic
The Service was perfect
Try the Cub Room Steak, its delectable
The ambiance was perfect and the service was unquestionably the best in the city
The Cub Room is truly the essence of fine dining
I have gone to the Cub Room a few times and kept on going since I am always in the area
However, the service I received there the last 2 times have been horrendous
The drinks are either wayyy too strong or they come to the table 20 minutes after you order them (and after pestering the waitress for them) The food is average and you can find better in Soho for better priced, but the ambiance is comfortable and nice
Service is below sub par and snooty
They need to change their attitude towards their patrons!
Celebrated my birthday with a large group and the service, food and atmosphere were outstanding
The seafood is freshm the servers are informative
I would recommend to anyone
For those who prefer land, they have a juicy filet mignon for you - cooked to perfection
Enjoy!
Service was perfect! Dinner was fantastic! The Cub Room exemplifies the true essence of a fine dining experience
We started our evening with an extremely tasty Mystic Salad, and continued with a delectable Rack of Colorado Lamb and completed our night with what we were told was the Cub Room Special Crme Brulee
I have not been to all of the Restaurants in Soho, but I have been to most and The Cub Room is without question the Best Restaurant in Soho
Thank you again for a terrific evening
A group of friends and I dropped in around 10 on a Monday night for a few rounds and some appetizers
However, we had a few little problems with the service
First, there was no host/hostess to sit us (we were in the small dining area near the bar)
We then tried to sit ourselves since there were a few vacant tables
However, a waiter said we can't do that and we have to wait
Well, we waited as we finished our drinks
And another round
Finally, we just sat down on our own
Then we couldn't get menus
Finally, a waiter dropped one menu on the table for six of us
It took him over 20 minutes to come back for our simple appetizer orders
Evidently, our waiter went to the Mediterrean for our humus pita because it took about 25 minutes
NEVER AGAIN!
I was looking for the perfect place to celebrate my wife's 40th Birthday
I went to city search and thought that The Cub Room was the perfect location
To my surprise, it was not only the perfect location, but it was one of the best restaurants in New York
I was given a private room, which accommodated my wife and myself and about 35 guests
I had a three-course menu, which included the most succulent steak I ever had
The service was fantastic
The entire event was a perfect 10
I highly recommend the Cub room for any occasion
My wife is still talking about that night
Thank you again for a great evening
I went to the cub room after looking at this site
I wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday with about 25 of our closest friends and family members
I was given a private room, which I wanted but did expect a restaurant to have
We were told about all of the packages they offered and choose a reasonable package
My wife had the best birthday ever
I just wanted to thank city search and also the Cub room for providing a great service and wonderful ambience
I don't think we could have chosen better
Thank you again
We were escorted to the table only to see fresh flowers on the table and rose petals sprinkled over the seats and tabletop
Our waitress was so wonderful to us
She was attentive and took care of our every need
The chef actually prepared a tasting for us, where we got to sample a generous portion from each item on the beautiful menu that you had made up
My boyfriend was completely surprised and he loved every detail of the restaurant, food and table
It was a night that the two of us will never forget
I have already raved about our night to my family and friends
They are eager to dine at the Cub Room and I am sure that my boyfriend and I will be back soon to experience another terrific night
Thank you so much again for making his night so special!
Unfortunately, what looked like a promising place, turned out to be a bit of a mistake
Food took over an hour despite at least two chasers, we had to track the server down to get extra drinks, the manager seemed to try and deliberately mislead us about the reason behind the delay and in the end the food was poor
We got it for free, but it was a rather disappointing evening
Shame really, it looked like a promising place
The food was great
The Service was great
I was told that they have functions there
The next function that I have I will make sure it's at the Cub Room
I recently had a surprise birthday party
I was so surprised when about 50 (+) of my closest friends and family was waiting form me in the cafe area of the restaurant for drinks and passed hors d'oeuvres and then later dinner
It was my best birthday

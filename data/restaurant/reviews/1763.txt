I've been to Le Singe Vert for brunch, lunch, and dinner many times and have never had a bad meal
The service is wonderful and the food is great -- and not too pricey
I highly recommend checking it out!
Wonderful food at great prices
The staff are great - just like they are in France (for people who have actually been and don't just write reviews like they know)
Definately try this place the only think you might be disappointed by is the proximity of the tables to each other (again very french)
Bon appetite
Came to the restaurant with a group of friends before the show
We were seated at 6:45
The restaurant advertises a prix-fixe menu until 7
After about 20 minutes of futile attempts to get attention of our waiter, he told that it's already 7:05 and refused to give it to us
Then, when we ordered from a regular menu, and told the waiter, that we are in a hurry to make the show, his response was So what do you want me to do ? And I didn't even talk about the food portions, which were definitely French (small)
So all in all, a complete French experience - rude, inattentive waiters, miniscule food portions
I felt like I visited Paris without ever going there
Au Revoir
Starting off a visit to New York with dinner at Le Singe Vert puts the rest of your dinner locales in a tough position
The Escargot and Potato/Blue Cheese Tart were excellent starters
The Fried Skate was superb, and the Hangar Steak was in a wonderful wine and shallot sauce
A shared Strawberry tart was good, though not as good the the rest of the meal
The service was fast and efficient
The ambience was eclectic and charming
Best of all, the price, including some wine by the glass was about $75 for two
You can't beat that in NYC
This restaurant was recommended on CS as romantic
Romantic it was not
the tables were so close together that they had to move the whole table for us to get to our seat
It was soooooooo LOUD in the restaurant that I couldn't hear what my date was saying all night
Although it was a little off Broadway, we decided to give this restaurant a try, and we're definately glad we did! The three course pre-theater dinner ($21
95) was an excellent value and is highly recommended
Try the chicken entree and flan dessert - both outstanding
The restaurant is a Parisien style cafe/restaurant, that attracts a diverse age group and crowd
The space is small, atmosphere is romantic and dark, and perfect if you're eating with a loved one
The food is of course, francais, and if you're into bland tasting, spiceless european food that will fill only a small portion of your hungry stomach, then you'll love it! Otherwise go there intent on ordering two appetizers plus the entree
The food is average, but if you do find yourself here, definitely order the Escargot (snails)
They're scrumptious
The price is affordable (~$25-$30 per person)
The fries were frozen, not fresh
Steak was great
Chicken meal was great
Salad apetizer was boring
Pate app was great
I'm not a fan of french food, and frankly, I hate eggs
However, this place is perfect for brunch
Strong, spicy bloody marys and a tomato and herb ommlette that you'll crave every Sunday afternoon
a great place for romantic dinner, great new wave and the 80's music, excellent food and wine(you can't go wrong here!!!), friendly service
Very charming Chelsea bistro
The waiters speak French, the mood is authentic and the food is not bad at all
Desserts are not their strength however!
The food was excellent and really reasonable, especially if you make it for the pre-theater menu for 19
95
We had the escargots for appetizers and the pan seared skate and steak frites- all excellent
The desserts on the pre-theater menu weren't as impressive, but the appetizer and entree alone was worth it! Only con was that some seating can be really cramped
A little piece of france in Chelsea
Everthing about this small resturant was wonderful
The food, service and ambiance was all very authenticly french
Don't forget your wallet, since they only take cash
I consistently have a great meals here
The staff is funky French, the food is good bistro fare, the prices reasonable and you rarely have to wait long to be seated
I love the escargots and the tuna steak
The atmosphere is charming, the waitstaff is adorable, the prices are reasonable, but honey, if I wanted mussels that tasted like they were prepared in old dishwater, I could have eaten uptown
We were seated promptly, and people there were very friendly
The food, overall, was better than expected ! It's definately worth a visit
And especially if you're a group of girls, you'll be triple-welcomed by the French guy (owner or manager) !!
This unassuming French delight is one of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC! A bunch of us celebrated a friend's birthday here and all 13 of us loved the meal, ambience and service
I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fine dining in an unpretentious setting, good company and excellent service
Be sure to try the rasberry sorbet - it is pure heaven!
The food is absolutely amazing as are the prices! Great lunch deals and the soups are to die for!!! The service is slow and the place is a bit small but it gives you that romantic feeling
I love this place go there often
Great place!
A wonderful local Italian restaurant with some imaginative and well prepared dishes
A broad menu and affordable wine list makes this a great place to take a date or a few friends
The goats cheese salad is superb
Service varies and may be slow
Restivo is a cozy neighborhood restaurant
Veal Piccata is to die for: creamy, tender, and flavorful
Service is pleasant and attentive
My only complaint is that the space is too small and can often feel crammed
This is a great Italian Restaurant
It is very small yet cozy and romantic
The food is excellent and the service is good, sometimes slow, but nothing to truely complain about
I have frequented this restaurant many times and have no complaints
The food is of average price and the drinks are great
They have excellent lunch specials
I highly recommend their lunch specials
You get so much for so little, just don't expect excellent service
Despite that - still a great place to eat
I love this cozy feeling chinese restuarant
People there are very friendly and the food is the best i tasted
I order from them at least once a week
A delicious combo of affordable Vietnamese and Chinese dishes served in the cutest little restaurant
Lunch prices are good and dishes are plentiful
Maybe the best sesame chicken sauce yet
Still confused about the origins of the red meaty pieces in the egg rolls, seemed to resemble to the Tropical fish in the tank by the kitchen
hmmm Everything was enjoyable and affordable
Food quality is always at its best
Prices are moderate
If you are a big eater, you may spend a bit more since the portions are small
Also, its good place to eat alone
Merchants is a welcome place in Chelsea
There's surprisingly little in the area for decent food and good drinks at reasonable prices

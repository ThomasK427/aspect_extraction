I would recommend this restaurant to anyone
Anyone who's West Indian knows this place is the place to go for Guyanese-style Chinese food
Whether it's 2 PM or 1 AM, the food is just as good
Alfie's has the greatest Pizza!!!! I would reccomend it to anyone!
There are several Bamboo Garden restaurants in Queens, but I've dined at the Liberty Ave
and Atlantic Ave
locations only
I've experencied better service at the Liberty Ave
location the cuisine is pretty good, but I prefer the Atlantic Ave
location's decor and its tastier cuisine
Both offer the same menu items, but the Atlantic Ave
location seems to make their dishes more tasty and it also has booths made to look like bamboo huts (very inspiring to a West Indian cuisine lover)
They also do takeout, for those pressed for time
Most of the fried rice dishes are non-spicy, so they have pepper on the side for those who need a kick for their tastebuds
I recommend the chicken fried rice and the pork with Asian vegetables
very delicious! BTW, the prices are very affordable, which make the mediocer service tolerable
This is a superb restaurant if you like big portions of traditional southern Italian food
Garlic is the buzzword here as its infused into everythng you eat
The baked clams are the best I have ever had as were the sausages (they make their own) with onions and peppers
The pasta with white clam sauce is to die for with big burnt morsals of garlic in it as well as minced in the sauce
Pasta marinara is like your mother used to make: perfect pasta with a tasty red sauce
Everything is made to order and is worth the wait
No reservations, credit cards or menus
The only menu is a big sign on the wall
The only wine is the cool house wine that you can chug-a-lug with everything
Other favorites are their various salads and shrimp Luciano
Try the Lobster Naki Style
Its big chunks of lobster in a thick gravy with a hint of ginger served over rice
Try it you will not be disappointed
This is the cheapest 24-7 spot i know of, but it's only useful if you live in or are willing to travel to rosedale queens
The food is good enough, but not mind-blowing
The deserts are horrid, but the drinks are always good
Always
The food was excellent
The service was a bit slow, although I was there at about 1 in the morning
Reasonably priced
As a Filipinophile I always crave for their food
I only wish they have seating inside
I've been eating Gaby's pizza since 1964 or 65
we always disagree to the opening year
Many years ago they were in a long, narrow store next to the fish store, then relocatewd to an abandoned Arthur Treacher's
The neighborhood has seen more changes than a $20 stripper, but Gaby's endures
The sauce still sweetly teasing, the crust a perfect cross between crisp and chewy
These guys know from making a great slice
OK, so it used to be 15cents a slice--$1
10 a pie--but what hasn't changed? Well, you know what hasn't changed? The quality of the pizza! Whenever I can I return for Gaby's amazing pizza
and now my kids have been hooked as well, as, probably, will be their children, too
The best slice in Queens, case closed
If you're a true New York pizza lover, this place will be a disappointment
If you're a tourist who only has Domino's as a local pizza parlor, this place could seem like a slice of heaven
Fortunately, I have had truly standout pizza from places like LB in Brooklyn and Gaby's just pales in comparison
Gaby's is so good you'll eat eat there even if you aren't hungy
This place has the best pizza in NYC
The crust is perfect, the sauce is perfect, and the cheese is perfect
They also have great sausage, meatballs, baked ziti, and a dish of penna alla vodka that can actually make you cry tears of joy
If you are ever in Queens and hungering for a slice you must try Gaby's!!!
Make your next slice A Perfect Slice, try Gaby's and you will be coming back for more
I have been going to Gaby's for over 20 years, there pizza and food is perfect
I've catered from Gabys for home and office parties and my guest and colleagues are always satisfied
My 11-year-old daughter Andrea loves their pizza and bake ziti
All the guys are great, as the saying goes service with a smile they got it
Special thanks to Andre and Steve as they go above and beyond to take care of me
I highly recommend Gaby's to all pizza eaters
You have not eaten pizza until you eat at Gaby's
I have been eating Gaby's pizza as long as I can remember
Being in the military and traveling extensively, Gaby's is the first place I go to when I return to NY
Food so good that I have yet to meet another person from Queens who is not familar with the quality of Gaby's pizza
A must have!!
Whenever I visit New York the first thing I crave is a slice of Gaby's pizza
The ingredients used are of a good quality and the taste is superb
Fresh tasting pizza can be hard to come by but Gaby's delivers the best!
I've been going to Gabys ever since I can remember there's none like it
Not only is their Pizza the best, their Lasagna is to die for
Everything is always fresh fixed to perfection
I live in Atlantam\ right now I'd love to be eating some pizza from Gabys right now :)
I have an 11 yr old son that luvs pizza but when you ask him where he wants pizza from, Gabby's is his 1st choice always and we drive 5 miles for it without blinking an eye
Of note, call in your order as the lines are long but they serve quickly
I totally agree
Growing up in Queens Village, this Pizzeria has grown from a small store front to a somewhat larger establishment
There Pizza is to die for
okay guys, let me just say that this is the greatest pizza, i mean , i don't know where to start
the sauce is like another world and it is always so juicy and the bread is soo good
I love it, i bring my friends all the time, and they have been there these guys, for a s long as i can remember, they love what they do and it shows in their food
If you decide not to go and check it ouit, your missing out HUGE! well, i hope one day you ll enjoy this pizza as much as me
CIAO
hands down this is the best pizza in all of nyc and the dishes are without a doubt the best in nyc
you must try this pizza shop you will not be diappointed with the results
this is without a doubt the best pizza in all of the five boroughs of new york city
you have to make your business to get to this pizzaeria and taste it for yourself, you will not be disappointed
For those of you that thinks only Manhattan has all the good food you are sadly mistaken
Gaby's Pizzeria in Hollis, Queens has some of the best pizza in New York
Take it from a true born and raised New Yorker who has had pizza in all five boroughs
The food at Gaby's is the best, if you want real homemade Italian food,this is the place to go, I love this place my family has been getting Pizza and pasta there since I was a little kid! Gaby's is the best in Queens, no one can touch them
It cozy enough that you can sit and have an intimate dinner or bring the family or just order for take out
this place has the best pizza around
they have like 25 different choices of pizza
i cant believe this place is not more well known to people
go there and order a regular pie to stay and make sure you tell them crispy
you hold that slice by the crust and it just does not sag down
i dont know what they in the dough

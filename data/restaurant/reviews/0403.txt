Wine, didnt arrive till we finished appetizers as food for the main dish took well an hour to take, when I have got up and called the waiter to take them
The main Dish, well our waiter miss calculated the fish size, so I shared one Fish with 3 people
I was embarrassed, upset and no matter that The food was great as I have gone there more then 10 times this year but NO more
Too bad Avra, you suck, you ruined one night for me
Good - food and decor
Bad - Waiters trying to con you by trying to make you buy more food that you can eat, nobody smiles and not are pleasent, pushy, opportunist and pompus
I dined at Avra this New Years Eve and it was one of the most memorable and fantastic meals ever
When we arrived we were seated promptly and graciously
I started with the lobster bisque - amazing, with huge peices of lobster
Next, I had the filet which was seared to perfection and one of the largest filets I have EVER had HUGE
The dessert was chocolate molten cake which was also amazing
The only drawback is that we didn't get champagne until after midnight so we had to toast w our water glasses but even that faux paus was not enough to ruin the evening
Great music, great service, fabulous food
The price was a bit steap but we were there from 9:15 until after 1 am so I think it was worth it
The best New Years ever!
In town on business, when asked to be seated by myself, you could feel the frustration in me taking up a table that would seat two people
Went ahead and ordered meal to go
Told it would be 15 minutes more like 40
Ordered humous and pita bread
Got humus and crusted bread
Chicken was good
Fries were cold
(Fries with chicken???) Had to go back to retrieve my credit card as well
Dont think I will go back unless I bring a friend and dine in
My husband I wanted to try a new seafood place as we were all grilled out
On a whim we ended up at Avra and had a wonderful evening dining with our friends
The service was friendly and present without being intrusive
The fish was wonderful we tried 3 different varieties and we found it to be fresh and tasty
Moderately expensive, but worth it
Excellent Greek food and great atmosphere
One of the only places in NYC where you can hand-select the fish that you want to grill
It was almost as good as Niko's restaurant in Naxos!
(Ate there on Feb 14, 2003)
Finally a reason to dine on the UES
Not only has it become my favorite Greek (above Molyvos, Milos, S'agapo) but it offers great seafood--fresh and varied
For starters, the grilled octapodi and stuffed calamari (with feta, tomatoes and herbs) were outstanding! Entrees of lupe de mare, dover sole (ask for fillet), and chilean sea bass (the BEST) were terrific! Don't forget to have dessert
sticky sweets of baklava, bougatsa and galactabouriko are not to be missed
Hurry, go you will not be disappointed!
outstanding greek cuisine
delicious fish, octupus, loup de mare, and calamari
the standard 4 dip combo was fantastic
great atmosphere, good service a bit pricey but well worth it
would definetely go back
Avra is a great midtown spot for lunch or dinner
The octapodi appetizer is a grilled gourmet sensation, its a must try for anyone who likes the eight legged sea creatures
The menu is a nice combination of greek favorites and fresh seafood, which is reinforced by the 'fish market like' display of whole fish in front of the kitchen
Great place to impressive your date with good food, even better place to impress your client on an expense account
I ate there over the weekend and i loved it
the food is great, the room is nice, and the service was just right
I went there last week with my friends and ordered some fish
First, the table was not set properly, the silverwears were dirty, the waiter barely spoke english-he had a strong accent, the fish plater was OK but the floor smelled like bleach! The manager was trying to be friendly by wearing a fake smile on his face but all he was showing was his real ignorance about restaurant managment
I passed Avra multiple times this summer with good intentions of trying it at some point
had I known that the food would be so delicious, flavorful, creative, and plentiful, this would have made the top of my list much sooner
The fresh fish and sefood dishes we tried were served in massive portions and superbly seasoned and cooked (or uncooked in re: to perfect tuna!)
The staff was attentive and amiable, and our server was very helpful when selecting from the extensive grappa and ouva selections
I rarely find need to travel above USquare for fantastic meals and service, but Avra is defintely something worth venturing uptown for
Had the pleasure of dining at Avra the other night, and as a regular NYC person with normal tastes, the food was exceptional! The octopus appetizer was tender with light flavors, the spanakopita was to die for, the lamb was so tender and flavorful, and the chilean sea bass was simply prepared with spices and tastes one would expect in Greece
The ambiance is extremely comfortable relaxing with polite, efficient service
I love this restaurant
Sit in the front room - it feels like a little bit of the Greek Islands right here in midtown - a nice change of pace from the normal, stuffy restaurants in this general area
Food is excellent - the mussels with ouzo and feta are incredible as is the grilled octopus
I frequently make a meal out of a bunch of appetizers
I been going there for the past year and half and i never had a bad meal
the food is the best greek food i ever had and i have been to many greek restaurants
the place is always very busy so you know they are doing something right, i would send many people to eat the great greek food
My visit to Avra was a great experience
The food, the service and the atmoshphere were all excellent
Finally, a place in NYC I can tell people to go to when they ask me for a good Greek restaurant
I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at Avra to see the outside seating
It was a beautiful evening and a perfect night
We did have to wait for a table being that we did not have a reservation however the waiting area was quite comfortable
When they seated we had a table in their courtyard and I actually felt like I left the city
we had the outside seating but not on the street where you have to listen to the cars
The food was great the service was terrific and the ambiance was outstanding
The Scene With its unadorned white walls and new pine floor, Arezzo is a big, open and loud space that gets louder as the evening progresses
The effervescent servers are as knowledgeable as they are enthusiastic
The Food The menu features straightforward Tuscan fare
Among the most popular dishes are broccoli cavatelli in a gutsy ragu lumpy with sweet sausage, and osso buco with saffron risotto
Focaccina alla robiola e spinaci, a sort of thin pizza pocket filled with piquant robiola cheese, also hits the mark
Black-and-white panna cotta, half-chocolate and half-eggless vanilla custard, is a good bet for dessert
Maybe it was my expectation but for me this restaurant did NOT live up to it's reputation
Upon entering we were greeted by a very friendly host and immediately seated
The wine selection was fantastic with countless wines to choose from, not that we'd know about it because the wine list does not come to your table unless you ask for it
The waiters were very friendly and helpful except they were unavailable for most of the night
A 6:45 pm mid week dinner reservation turned into a 3 hour affair
While we passed the time with no problem it became evident that this establishment focused on bringing the customer in quickly and with great service but once you had ordered it was a completely different story
There was no quick bus boys or even full waitiers to refill the water, pick up finished plates (30 minute wait after we finished until our plates were picked up and our dessert order was taken) or even refill the wine
The simple but romantic setting of Arezzo is negated by the loud customers seated closely together
I would avoid Arezzo if you are trying to have a quiet night as you simply will not be able to speak quietly because to keep up with the atmosphere you will have to talk loud yourself
The meals were prepared with high quality and fresh ingredients but there was really nothing special to make Arezzo really stand out - it was simply average
The only thing that stood out about my dinner was MY choice of wine and the simply amazing tiramisu (maybe I just love chocolate?!?)
Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to make reservations for Arezzo again
It is an average restaurant if you're in the neighborhood looking for a place to eat and simply walk-in
I went here with a co-worker for lunch and was very glad we did
The ambaiance was nice and the service was attentive
I had the chicken with snowpeas and roasted potatoes
My coworker had the Pizza Margherita which willl be what I will try next time
We both left satisfied and ready to face the rest of our work day
Yes, a good choice for lunch
This restaurant is a rare find in NYC

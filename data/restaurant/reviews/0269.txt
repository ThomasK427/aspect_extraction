Metsovo is amazing restaurant
The ambience is magic and the food is excellent
The wine list is extensive but the servers know their stuff
The stuff here make you feel welcome and give your personal attention and they value every new client as he is one of the regulars
My guest and I were there for about 4 hours and did not even realize it
Would definitely recommend
After reading several positive reviews of Metsovo on various websites, I was looking forward to a nice pre-theatre date
The ambiance is lovely - fireplace, candles, romantic
However, the food and service were simply bad
The highlight was the bread basket, with sun-dried tomato focaccia and herbed goat cheese spread
But, specialty saganaki (the one with pear) was so overcooked that it squeaked when we chewed, and drowned in a cloyingly sweet sauce
Lamb yiannina was poorly seasoned and bland, the lamb Epirus Mountain pie was filled with what looked like chopped-up leftovers from someone else's dinner
The cookies served for dessert were dry beyond belief
The service was slow and inattentive - we waited 10 minutes for our bill despite repeated attempts to get our server's attention
Definitely not worth the price tag, even though the prices are moderate-ish for NYC
Spend a little extra and go to Molyvos
The dining room is beautiful and very comfortable with couches on one side of many tables
The service was great
Our waitress was Greek and we spent awhile speaking with her
The hot appeatizer platter was wonderful
Everyone else got chicken or lamb pies and they were happy
I unfortuntely picked the seared tuna loin and it was awful
Not cooked the way I wanted it and it was without any flavor what so ever
That was the only bad part
We even got free dessert wine!
This relaxing warm room could have been great
It's expensive for a casual restaurant with mediocre food
Get a great chef, make it dressier, make the service snappier and you've got a winner
As it is now I would NEVER go back, I'll just go next door to Aegean which shares a kitchen, bathroom, and ownership
Pleasant, warm restaurant serving good Greek food
However, avoid the bar at all costs
Generously spent in resstaurant followed by nightmare after dinner drinks experience in downstairs, want to be cool bar
Thug-like bar staff was aggressive, unaccommodating and rude
Restaurant manager contributed to bad atmosphere
So, good meal gone bad
The Scene Glass tabletops, abundant houseplants and travel-agency-ready shots of the Vietnamese countryside make up the decor at this fast-moving Chinese-Vietnamese hybrid
Lunches are generally a scene of organized chaos, as hosts shepherd in jurors and lawyers on break from the nearby courthouses and bussers and servers sprint from table to table
It's a true churn-and-burn operation, and table-sharing is common
The Food Pho tai represents one of the better price-to-value culinary propositions in the world, and Nha Trang's version is excellent, thick with plenty of rice noodles and strongly aromatic of basil
Crunchy, flavorful spring rolls are another worthy option, as is banh xeo (a crispy yellow rice-flower pancake folded over mushrooms, shrimp and sprouts) and chao tom (barbecued shrimp paste on sugarcane)
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends
The pho is incredible, and I am a particular fan of the summer rolls, water spinach with garlic/hollow vegetables, and squid with chili lemongrass
The wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient
Once you become a regular, you are treated as one
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste
No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food
I went here twice in the last week while on vacation in NewYork and found the Pho to be very good
My son loved it the first time we went but was not to happy with his Pho on the next trip
I would recommend this place because the pho I ordered had such excellent flavor!
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more
Light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners
Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go
The average price for each dish during lunch is between $4
50 and $5! How can you beat that? There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down
The service is descent even when this small place is packed
Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to
the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection
i've noticed megadeth, mr
scruff, st
germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played
Having spent many months seaching for the best pho in the city, Nha Trang Centre is well in the lead
Aromatic broths, perfect noodles, crisp accoutrement, and cheap prices, it is only unfortunate the soup doesn't come in larger bowls
Oh, the rest of the menu seem first rate as well but with soup like that, who cares
I liked the food and the presentation
The waiters were somewhat friendly
Nice drinks
Very nice place to visit for a great price
In Short Though it's more of a takeout and delivery operation than a sit-down restaurant, Risotteria does offer eight small tables for those who want to savor their risotto hot off the stove
Risottos are classified here based on the variety of rice, from the highly-starched arborio to the creamy carnaroli
Slabs of prosciutto, Italian sausage, pork shoulder and other meats, all of which can be added to the rice, wait behind the counter
Panini and salads are also available
Found a listing about this place online and decided to check it out while in NYC for the weekend
I have been GF for a little over a year and have not found a lot of really tasty options - this place is fabulous! I ordered GF pizza GF beer, and shared GF breadsticks GF dessert with my husband - I was STUFFED but it was worth it
It felt so great to eat normal food again
My hubby ordered regular panini and GF beer
He thought the panini was a little tough, but overall very good food
It is a little pricey (but most GF foods are
) and cramped, so it's best to hit it at off-peak times and be prepared to treat yourself
:) They are starting a mailorder/internet service soon, so maybe those of us outside of NYC can special order the GF foods! Yum!!
I went here on a saturday night and it was moderately crowded and i was there for my birthday and i ordered the gruyere and green onion risotto and the olive puree pizza which tasted better than traditional sauce and cheese pizza and then afterwards everyone should take a walk to magnolia's
A cozy small space with friendly waiters
Food is always excellent and inexpensive
Don't stay there too long because people are waiting at the bar
Just enjoy eat and go!
My wife needs a gluten free diet and this is the best GF food she has found
The rest of the family loved the regular pizza and it reminded me of the kind I could only find in Rome
The space is cramped and the prices are rather high, from a New Orleans viewpoint, but we enjoyed the food and found the service to be friendly and helpful
It's also in a great neighborhood which just begs to be strolled through
I was in the restaurant with my GF last Fri

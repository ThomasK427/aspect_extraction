$14 23 layer chocolate cake tasted like it had been cooked in with the steak and had an unwelcoming smokey flavor
go for a drink at the bar but don't bother going any further!
We were promptly seated but hardly welcomed at all
Got seated right next to a HUGE floor standing air con
Whats this Bangladesh or? Asked the maitre for a wine recommendation and straight he went to a 280 USD recommendation
Really sad and unprofessional
Starters were below average especially the asparagus wich were almost still frozen
Onto their famous steaks
Overdone of course (as almost always in NY) with a BLACK and BURNED thick crust on them
I really stated to the waiter the we wanted our steaks rare as they should be if you expect high quality meat but to no avail
All in all we felt sad and extremely dissapointed after spending 600$ in a classic tourist trap!!!!! Two tables next to us also seemed to have different problems both with food and service
Remarkable even when the restaurant was almost empty (no surprise)
What a dissapointment!!!!!
I had heard some pretty negative things about Michael Jordan's (service and over-cooked steak), but I found none to be true on my recent visit
I had 7:00pm reservations, was seated and attended to immediately
As the restaurant became increasingly crowded, the service remained quick and pleasant
I had a tasty Caesar salad for an appetizer and ordered the 10 oz Fillet Mignon medium rare
Having heard that the steakhouse had a tendency to overcook the steaks, I asked the waitress that she ask the chef to prepare it closer to rare than medium
It came out perfectly and was delicious
My dinner guest said his was great as well (the beef tips [medium])
The sides were nothing special (we had the sampler) but good enough
The ambience is spectacular
I would definitely go back!!!
Best steakhouse in NYC and I've been to them all Best food and best location and ambience My friends from London still talk about Michael Jordan's and tell everyone they know about it
November, 2004 - The restaurant is lovely
Our waiter was unprofessional
My bestfriend ordered Peppercorn Buffalo - medium well done
Peppercorn sauce wasnt flavorful
I ordered the strip steak medium - the waiter or the chef reversed our requests
I had my overcooked steak replaced; my friends buffalo cooked longer
The waiter insisted I ordered well done! The waiter suggested an excellent bottle of Bordeaux (almost worth the $65 price)
My friend ordered dessert and was served the wrong dessert; the waiter insisted she was wrong
A couple sitting at the table next to us said they'd heard her order that particular dessert because they wanted the same thing and wanted to see our order! The waiter with lots of attitude changed the order
The fries were good and steak was ok
My girlfriend was disappointed with the Buffalo
I will not return to Michael Jordan's nor recommend it!
My husband and I ate here for a birthday celebration and had the perfect dinner
Our food was delicious - the wait staff was friendly and not pretentious at all and the service was just perfect
It took us about 1:45 from start to finish and was perfect
We had the ceasar salad which was nice and the filet - perfect and the ny strip - perfect
we had the combination side sampler which was delicious
I think it was worth the money spent and is an establishment I will go back to again
I chose to go to MJS over many other best-rated competitors because I have always had a great time there
However, yesterday the experience was terrible
The steaks were both overdone (we ordered medium rare)--there was a crunchy, burnt part on the filet mignon, and the ribeye steak was mostly gristle
I could not even cut it since it was so chewy
Luckily, management agreed with me and removed the price of the ribeye from our bill
The only thing that was decent last night was the gorganzola bread appetizer and the mashed potatoes
The broccoli rabe--blah! I was disappointed since we had gone there for a special occasion
Had that been my first time there, I would definitely never have returned
But I am keeping an open mind since MJS has never disappointed me before, prior to last night
I have NEVER in my life had such horrible service (and I eat out a LOT)
The food was great, although not worth the price
the service was non-existent, the staff was rude, it was a complete disappointment
I dine in the MJS in Connecticut frequently and would highly recommend it, but you could not pay me to eat in the NY restaurant again
I thought it was great
The service was perfect, food was excellent
The steak was the best I ever had
For desert I had the fruit bowl, it was the freshest fruit I had ever eaten
I would recommend Michael Jordans to everyone
The one thing I didn't like about this restaurant was that you eat INSIDE Grand Central Station
The station is beautiful, but I felt out of place eating in it
Also, the steak is decent, but I definitely like Peter Luger's the BEST
It is said that MJ has never set foot in his eponymous restaurant, and now I know why
You can't find a server and when you do, he is more interested in hitting on your date then doing his job
Steaks are average at best, seafood is way below par
Ambiance is great if you get a table overlooking the mezzanine
Beyond that, if you need the be in GCS, stop here for the hot bar action
If you want to have a good steak, go to Lugars
What an awesome place
GREAT FOOD and GREAT Environment
Don't let the Grand Central Terminal scare you as it is quieter than most Manhattan restaurtants
Well priced and balanced wine selection
Service was impeccable! Ask for Sal as your Waiter!!
went there for lunch, hostess asked if we had reservations and we didn't
she then gave us some nasty look and told us to go up the stairs where the restaurant was not even full
after sitting at the table for ten minutes i asked someone for menus
bread came another 10 minutes later
we ordered filets, and ny steaks eventhough our waiter kept pushing up to get the porterhouse
then it took more 40 minutes for our steaks to arrive
i got a ny steak strip
it was good but i wasn't sure how long they dry aged it because it wasn't as flavorful as it should have been
mashed potatoes were ordinary
fries were good hot and crispy
i guess you pay for the location
wouldn't go there again though
If you are a serious steak eater, looking for a serious steak in Midtown, Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is the place for you
The porterhouse for two was probably the best steak I have ever eaten
They preslice it for you, the service was incredible, and the steak fries were great too
It was a little pricey however ($70) and the MJ Steak Sauce isn't as good as ol' reliable A1
You can also reserve MJ's private table with groups of six or more
I would definitely go back
I go there time to time
I kind of know some of those guys that work there
Overall it's fantastik
Food is superb,steaks are great nometer what temp u wont them
service is super friendly and amazingly noledgeble
I LOOOOOVE their wine list
The last time i was there with my friend from Nebraska their wine guy recomended a bottle of heller estate cab sauvig which was more than delicios
What can i say that's my place where everybody knows my name

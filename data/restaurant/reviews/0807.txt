fast, hot food, pretty inexpensive
And they have take out and free delivery
I love this place and I recommend it to everyone that I know
They have THE best spring rolls
They might have large servings, but they are happy to wrap up left overs for you
And if you are more than one person, then it's perfect sharing sizes
This place is amazing and the value is absolutely incredible
If you want very generous potions of fresh food at a fair price this is the place for you!! Vegie dumplings are incredible and they're soups are amazing!!
Numerous times have the people of Lannam gotten my order wrong
I don't why it's so hard to put lettuce in a bowl with their carrot dressing (I hate rice, is a substitute too much to ask for?)
Not only that, the proportions are way too big
There's no reason for a dish prepared for one to be able to feed a family of 6
How American of you Lannam!!!
I have visited the restaurant on three occassions and I have been extremely satisfied on all three visits
They food was excellent as well as the service
I like the fact that I can actually have a relaxing lunch on my lunch hour
I HIGHLY recommend giving the restaurant a try
They first got the order wrong
(I asked for spicy beef and broccoli) Then they tried to pass it off as the right order
Then they said they would correct the order
I was then made to wait 5 minutes and they tried to give me the same order that was sitting there on the counter! When I told them, No, that's the same order they said, Why don't you just add these spice packets to it
I had to speak to the manager to change the order who in turn gave me a very hard time about it
I wrote a letter to the restaurant and never heard back
Please do not support this restaurant for the sake of principle
This had to be the worst experience I ever had at a Thai restaurant
The food was awful! I ordered Pad Thai and they actually had the audacity to give me something that doesnt even remotely look or taste like Thai Food in fact it didnt taste like anything! I had to add innumerable packets of duck sauce just to even begin to resemble real food
Despite these efforts, there was no way to distract me from the play-doh consistency of it all
To all my Thai lovers out there here are a few words of advice
Whenever you venture into a Thai restaurant and ask for Plum Sauce and they act like youre speaking a language that is neither English nor Thai , run as fast as you can because youre in for a big disappointment!
I visit Devon Blakely at location 780 3rd Avenue @ 49th St, NY,NY 10017 everyday for lunch
The cashier's there are extremely rude rash keep laughing looking at me my friends all the time,(god knows what they find so funny) even after i complained to the manager regarding this issue over the phone emailed them
There is still no improvement in customer service and this makes me reconsider my loyalty at this location of theirs
Theis soups salads are good but because of bad service to customers i stopped going there
I my office colleagues thereby decided to write this review about this location as i want to share my experience with others
Cafe Zaiya, hidden amongst the side streets is one of my favorite bakeries/cafes
The pastries are to die for with amazing strawberry shortcake
They offer cakes by the slice or whole and all are heavenly
Zaiya offers up a selection of food as well with hot plates such as the Spicy beef bowl, or chicken carbonara that are delicious
When the kitchen closes, Zaiya also offers it's usualy selection of bread, premade sandwiches (my favorite is the BLT) and pre-cooked mini-meals in bento boxes
Everything is decently priced at about $8 or under, excluding the cakes
A great alternative to fast food when the last thing you want to do is cook and going out to a restaurant feels too exhausting
One of my neighborhood favorites, I keep going back
Great selections of bento boxes; sandwiches; sushi the great stuffed breads
And the discount when it gets close to closing
But by then it's slim pickings
The food was very good
It's fun to walk around and choose from pre-made lunch boxes to baked goods, to sandwiches, to sushi sets
The food is delicious! Once I paid, I went over to tables, these should be cleaned up more often
Still, this cafe is in a prime location and serves as a great place to grab a snack and rest for a spell
I thought they had the best service
ladies behind the counters are always pleasant and friendly
Very good selection of sandwiches, breads, pastries, and of course the bear papa puffs! They have awsome selection of lunch sandwiches and japanese style meals
A must try! and prices are so good! i wish i can live here
The girls behind the counter were very rude
When I presented my valid discount card they rolled their eyes and told me I should've mentioned it before I ordered
Very unpleasant but I must say their baked goods are awesome
Small, but great! My daughter picky eater just LOVEs this place, as do I! Even has vegatarian stuff!
The burritos are great, huge, flavorful
The place is small, tiny, cramped
Look past the interior and there is an absolute delicious assortment of burritos and other mexican fare that will fill you up and satisfy your cravings
A definate winner for inexpensive and quick Mexican food
I have to say this place has awesome burritos they are huge !!! The taste is great
I have to say I love th eburriot so I have not tried much else, but I had a bite of the steak cucmber wrap its soo good, can't figure out what the sauce is but its yummy ! Although its very small so I would only recommend take out or delivery
I used to really love this place
I really did
It's hard to find a good burrito in the city
But lately as the popularity of this place increased, I started to notice the burritos got smaller and smaller
Who are they trying to kid? Who's trying to save money here? Not the customer, that's for sure
then you have to eat here! The burgers sucked! The bun was stale and hard and the burger meat was dry and tasteless
My friend had the pastrami which was ok, but I would rather have it at Katz's Deli anytime
Their salads are excellent! Fresh Delicious
Plus they are open 24 hours a day and deliver
We tried this pub for a late breakfast around 10am
It was busy, the staff were indifferent
Our food was average, we were served dry toast and pancakes without butter
Had to ask for jam and butter
Wait staff never checked back, had to take the check to the bar to pay
Wouldn't go back
The Scene Bright murals, the source of a 1930s controversy, overlook this comfortable, tiered dining room in the Warwick Hotel, redesigned in shades of ivory and red but retaining the eponymous colonial scenes
The hushed atmosphere is broken occasionally by rambunctious hotel guests, but for the most part calm reigns
Service is affable but missteps can mar the experience
The Food The menu's American standards--steaks, salads, raw bar goodies--are punctuated by occasional exotic flourishes, like Thai beef salad and Ecuadorian ceviche
These can be excellent: the Thai salad's strips of steak are gently limey, and the frisee is dressed in a sweet chili sauce
But the classics are the real standouts: Steamed clams are tender, garlicky, and juicy; steak au poivre is perfectly spicy; and mushroom risotto is musky and filled with succulent fungi
A dark, complex lobster bisque also deserves mention
Excellent desserts include an exceptional napoleon with fresh berries and chocolate pastry
Attentive and caring service
Water glass was never empty
(did the busboy attend to only our table?) I have a wheat allergy and the waiter made sure that everything I ordered was wheat free
Pre theater dinner a great value
The restaurant is attractive, quiet and we will certainly be back soon
Convenient to City Center, MTC and Carnegie Hall
i went there on a date and thought it was the perfect choice
the environment was quiet enough that we could hear each other yet there were others around
the paintings were beautiful and gave us somehting to talk about
I had the sea bass and it was GREAT!!! highly reccomend it for occasions where you want an upscale yet casual dining experience while focusing on your company
i went to Murals w/ a colleague of mine, and i picked it due to its ratings on citysearch, and it did not meet expectations
The carpaccio i got was very tasty, and the warm bread was good, but our main course took 25 min to arrive, and the waiter never apologized
My plate was burning, b/c my salmon was waiting under the lamp for a
LONG time

I really love the Pear Cake
It's wonderful but the service is absolutely horrendous
It's like they have an attitude with everone that isn't French
They are pretty snobby, just get something to go
This place is great if you're just picking up an order
Their pastries are fantastic! But the service sucks! The people there are so inattentive and rude that everything good about it is outshined by the bad vibes from the waitresses and manager
I wouldn't know
My friends and I (8) went one weekend afternoon
We had to wait, understandable
We had to ask to find that out
No one told us
We then waited for oh, half an hour or so, with nothing from the staff other than excuse me, as they tried to get by us
Again somewhat understandable as there is not a lot of space
Then inexplicably, the only man there (maybe the manager/owner?) told us rather rudely to move back that we were in the employee only area
We hadn't been told that before
We moved back
He then proceeded to get into an argument with one of our group and threw us out
Yes
That's right
I have no idea why
As far as I know, none of my group had done anything out of line
So, yes, it could be great, but I wouldn't know
In Short Only a block or two over from the noise of West Broadway, this tiny cafe--split into two separate rooms--is a place to relax over morning coffee and a home-baked goodie, like buttermilk-currant scones or the namesake tarts
The lunch offerings (chicken potpie, mixed greens, daily salads or soups) are homemade and inexpensive
I work in Soho, and there are few affordable lunch spots in this neighborhood, so when I came upon Once Upon a Tart, I rejoiced! My roasted turkey sandwich with brie and cranberry on a baguette was delicious, and the pear ginger muffin was quite honestly the best muffin I've ever had
Even better, it was the cheapest sandwich I've found in the neighborhood
The only drawback was that I had to wait at the counter for a bit before anyone came to help me, and then, when she did, she was less than friendly
But, it won't keep me from going back
my favorite coffee shop in SoHo- from ever
keep it up!
This cozy cafe has great food and decent prices - the tarts, soups, salads, and madelines were yummy!!! Staff was helpful and nice - go, you won't be sorry!
if you're not from the nabe, would love one like it in my own
While the cookies disappoint, the salads, scones, macaroons, sandwiches, and (of course) the tarts are fabulous :-)
Been going here since it opened
perfect place for a great lunch or coffee break(can get crowded though)
Now they're serving first rate Chocolate cupcakes that wipe the floor with Magnolia
Once Upon a Tart has wonderful sandwiches, absolutely delicious tarts and mouthwatering desserts
The muffins are the size of a softball and are baked fresh everyday! Once upon a Tart has an excellent catering menu which, although a bit pricey, gives you a lot of choices and varitey, is not skimpy on the portions and is simply YUMMY! Its fun to eat in the store itself, as it is quaint cafe-style joint, but it's often difficult catching a table during lunch hours as the NYU crowd makes this a popular hang-out for coffee and nosh
Fresh baguettes, sliced pate cornichons
And the ubiqutous panini
No seats, just a countertop, but Washington Square Park is 2 blocks away
The Scene The modest-looking bakery is one of New York's great landmarks
With appearances in innumerable films, photographs and paintings during its eight-decade existence, the green, stenciled facade of this Prince Street fixture has come to symbolize an Old World/New York craftsmanship only scarcely evidenced in Soho's current rash of chain store hegemony
The Goods The bakery lovingly churns out the kind of handcrafted, heart-wrought bread that's kept Vesuvio in business since your granddad was a kid
You won't find any fancy multi-grain, nut-studded loaves here-it's all about the classics
The pepper rings, biscuits and crusty Italian loaves here are as good as you're ever going to get, and Vesuvio's old-school ambience and artisanal values are something to be treasured
This place has gone downhill since Tony passed away
It is truly dissappointing
All we have left is our memories!!!
The owners are rude, the service poor and the coffee is crap
Vesuvio bakery is one of the last true places that made soho what is is today
The landmark bakery now serves fantastic paninis, wraps, salads and some of the finest coffee I have ever tasted
I used to go there whenever I was in the city for bread
I now make it a point to either have breakfast of lunch
Everything is truely amazing in this perfectly decorated landmark
It was also called New Yorks most photographed storefront of all time
A perfect 10
The Scene Since its 1997 debut, Keith McNally's Soho bistro has retained its buzz and irresistible allure, and even the most abbreviated survey of the New York restaurant world would be incomplete without a visit
Two-thirds of the appeal is atmospheric, and the look is that of an airy aged brasserie--faded saffron yellow walls, oversized mirrors
The years of cosmopolitans, iced shellfish towers and celebrity-studded brunches have only given a comfortable wear to the red leather banquettes
The Food Classic bistro standards include a house salad with baby greens, fennel, asparagus and haricots verts napped in white-truffle oil; textbook duck confit with wild mushrooms; excellent skate with raisins and capers; and the requisite steak frites, which, despite being oft-overcooked, fly out of the kitchen in droves
Weekend brunches draw an equally bustling scene for savory crepes, puff pastry stuffed with scrambled eggs and doused with hollandaise sauce, and French toast made with homemade brioche
Top to bottom, the best restaurant in the city
The food
The service
The ambience
You can't ask for better
A must- have is the fois gras
Do not leave without tasting that
I went there with my 4 other girl friends 2 weeks ago and we had a great time at Balthazar
The food was beyond delicious! What also impressed me is their excellent service
Great place to dine out!
For the complete NY dining experience, this is it
A georgeous room, great atmosphere, good food, good service and an eclectic mix of people
I go back time and time again, and it rarely disappoints
I've been here twice, and I was thoroughly unimpressed both times
For a French restaurant in New York city that prides itself on its bakery, it was pedestrian at best
The tables were too close together, the food wasn't impressive, and the service was often times completely missing - waiting 45 minutes between ending dinner and being asked about dessert is not what a restaurant of this caliber should be all about
Love this place - - one of my favorites! Definitely worth a visit
This is one of my all-time favorites for Sunday brunch
It's such an institution
Granted, it's loud and sometimes obnoxious and it's such a pain to get seats for, but the the food is great
What I consider Sunday brunch comfort food
The french fries with mayonnaise, scrambled eggs vol au vent with asparagus, burger, steak frites, trout salad, french onion soup, they're all delicious
I'd recommend going for brunch particularly on Sundays because their menu is different on that day - eggs meurette (poached eggs simmered in red wine sauce), very yummy and only available on Sundays
The profiteroles and lemon tart are also very delicious
The chef here means business
The food here is so good it makes you rethink what good food is
Among everything else mentioned below, the Duck Shepard's Pie is one of my favorites
I agree the fish selections are a little out there but everything else is good to go
Wine list is great, waiters know a lot about the wines
Celeb sightings have happened to me more than once here
If you dont have a reservation for dinner (and you're not famous) dont even THINK about trying to get a table here - you will be turned away or offered the opportunity to scrounge for an open table by the bar which is always PACKED
This place is far too busy most of the time
I have walked past as late as three in the afternoon for lunch and people were stacked up four deep at the bar
Breakfast is another story
The food is just as good
You can have a banquette to your self
And pick up a free Times at the door as you walk in the place
Went Monday at 7pm and theywere packed witha 45minute waitinglist tobe seated at a table inthebar - thewait forthe restaurantwas muchlonger

My boyfriend and I love going to Pio's when we want to have a nice dinner in the West Village without the crowds
The waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us, and the food is wonderful, if not stunningly creative
I'm in love with the lobster ravioli! We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the dessert menu
We were a little disappointed at first when Sud, the French restaurant that formerly occupied this spot, disappeared, but we're glad that Pio's has come to stay
It's a high-class, low-pressure place
What a mistake
The physical lure of the restaurant lies in a cookie-cutter combination of dark-orange walls and flickering candles
What a concept in New York! The food was extremely poor
The Bruschetta is sliced bread with a cheap bean salad heaped on top
My $15 chicken dish was a few oddly-shaped nuggets of dry chicken in a luke-warm watery sauce with half-frozen sausages on top and canned mushrooms
One of my friends ordered a Ravioli dish which looked and smelled like Chef Boyardee
We ordered cake which was a store-bought slice with cheap whipped cream framing it
We also had to dodge flames walking through their kitchen to get to the dirty bathroom
The waiter kept on listening to our conversation and was definitely resentful of the whole serving food thing
Just
a bad experience, and ended up costing me over $30 for my meal
The Scene White sails pulled taut overhead, honey-colored wood plank floors, a marble bar--it feels like dining aboard a beautifully restored sailboat
The lighting is flattering, the crowd somewhat serious and service generally attentive and well-meaning
The Food If the decor isn't hint enough, the fresh fish packed in ice just to the left of the bar will erase any uncertainty: Seafood is the house specialty, and it's reliably fresh
Start off with feta-stuffed grilled calamari, tender, subtly sweet veal dolmas or rare scallops wrapped in shredded phyllo dough and served with a tangy caper sauce
If they've got it, order the lethrini, a delicate white fish, simply perfect when grilled and drizzled with lemon and olive oil
The hearty braised lamb shank is irresistible as well
Don't miss almond baklava for dessert
A great experience
Cool decor, great service and delicious food
The seafood is particularly good
The menu is eclectic, not just Greek, so it has something for everybody
My fianc proposed to me during our 2yr anniversary dinner at Thalassa
The maitre'd and our waiters were all so lovely and provided amazing service
We ordered the scallops appetizer and a grilled white fish off the fish-by-the-pound selection
Both were delicious! After the proposal they gave us free champagne and dessert on the house
The champagne was a very good quality and the dessert was also quite good! We could not have had a more magical night if it were not for the staff at Thalassa
Thank you guys! Hope to hold our rehearsal dinner here :)
The restaurant greatest achievement is having collected so many enthusiastic reviews that suspiciously forget to mention how expensive it is
I am one of the original Zagat reviewers, I have eaten in more than 500 restaurants in NYC alone and I have a weak spot for fish
The food is good, at times very good, but to call Thalassa the best fish restaurant in NYC is way overextended
I can think of at least twenty other places that are, in my opinion, much better for fish than Thalassa
And quite a few of them cheaper than Thalassa
68 dollars for a special-of-the-day crab main course and 87 dollars for a fish a la carte are definitely expensive
I guess someone has to pay for the fresh orchids in the restrooms! Incidentally, the sheep butter thaty serve the bread with is very good; and desserts - totally unimpressive - can be skipped entirely
my girlfriend brought me here for my birthday and i was beyond satisfied
the decor was wonderful along with the place not being overcrowded
the waiter was also very helpful and convinced us to try the sweetbread as an appetizer which pleasantly surprised us
for the main course i had probably the largest shrimp i've ever seen grilled up along with the risotto
overall a great experience
Went during restaurant week and had a great meal
Food was very well done we added the meze plate for starter and it was beautifully presented as well as delish! We were both pleased with our entrees and the attentativeness of the waiter was perfect
Not too much and we were never lacking for anything
Planning to revisit very soon
Celebrated my birthday with 2 other couples, What a pleasant, fantastic experience we all had at Thalassa
Even the comments from neighboring tables where just like ours, fantastic, Superb Dishes, Freshest, Unique Fish Staff was very accommodating with everything
My boyfriend selected an amazing Greek Wine, the name was something like Magic, we started with the white then the sommelier moved us into a Red, Rapsani Grand Reserve from Mt Olympus we all felt like we where drinking eating with the Greek GodsGreat place cant wait to go back very soon
I enjoy having drinks with my girlfriends in the beautifully-decorated, relaxing bar/lounge area of this restaurant from time to time
Excellent bartenders and an expansive wine list make for a good mix
One can sit either at either the long, marble bar (frequently decorated with rose petals, a nice touch), or if immediacy of service is not an issue, in the relaxing lounge area by the front window
The only thing preventing Thalassa from becoming my regular hang-out is the proximity of an obsequious and slightly creepy maitre d', but given all the plusses of this place, he's easy enough to ignore
I took my wife here after hearing nice things from co-workers
Since we are both seafood lovers we were hoping for the best
we weren't disappointed
I had a delicious lobster dish and my wife had sole roasted in olive oil
Both were extremely tasty
The wine list was excellent and the service was very attentive
We'd definitely go back again
with 8:30 reservations for my birthday, we were not seated for another hour
our appetizers came out relatively quickly, but it was near impossible to get a hold of a waiter to order and get our drinks
after waiting over an hour for our entrees to arrive, we just gave up and asked for the check
there was no excuse for such extended waits, given that other (LARGER) parties who had arrived after we did, were already done with their meals
not until we asked for our check did the waiter start coming out with entrees
we declined and received NO apology for the poor service
after the horrible experience, the manager didn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge the bad situation
there was NO excuse for our poor treatment
they ruined our nights and left us hungry and searching for food at midnight
ok food, HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MANNERS!
A wonderful evening was spent at Thalassa
An upscale restaurant with spacious well appointed decor, excellent service and eceptionally well prepared food
The wine menu was overpriced--unless you order the moderately priced Greek Wines
Request the Wine Steward to suggest a wine from the wide selection of Greek Wines
We found our Greek wine to be surprisingly good!! This is essentially a fish restaurant --not your typcial Greek food
The fish dishes were outstanding!!!
I went here for my good friend's birthday and had a lovely experience
The drinks were exotic and the food was delicious
Let's not forgot how beautiful the actual restaurant looks on the inside
The only downside is that the restrooms are located in the lower level far far away (think of a maze)
We went during restaurant week and it was a good experience
The deco and ambiance is beautiful and impressive
The food was good but you have to be willing to try different things
Great spot for large groups
The service is excellent
A tad expensive but it comes with the territory! I give 3 stars ***
I went here last week with my sister to try out the restaurant week prix-fixe menu
The $35 dinner was well spent
The food overall is above average but not awesomely great
I had the fish which was abit overcooked and the desert was way too sweet for our taste
However, the lamb my sister had was quite good
Also, they have excellent cocktail menu and we wanted to try all of them! The crazy apple martini was memorable
The waiter was attentive but not overbearing and gave good recommendations on the cocktails
The down-stair private party area seems conducive to a group gathering for special events
The dinner started out just fine
My appetizer consisted of two overcooked shrimp, three very gritty mussels, and a surprisingly ordinary eggplant stuffed ravioli
My wife had Horiatiki, an incredibly uninspired Greek salad with soggy cucumbers slices

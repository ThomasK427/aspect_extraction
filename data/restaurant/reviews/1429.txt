It's a perfect place to start a night out with friends or a date
Just an undiscovered gem all around
I started going to Kion just a few months ago, originally for drinks and later for dinner and now I can say that I am a regular
The atmosphere is unique and the food is excellent (I love the parijuela I am not sure if that is how it is spelled)
I have taken both friends and clients and both groups were impressed with the dcor, the food and the drinks
A few weeks ago I took about 10 Chinese clients who usually tend to be very picky about what they eat (non Chinese food) and they loved it
By the way one of the unique characteristics of the place is that it is a very international crowd and changes dramatically every time I have gone there, but always very sophisticated
I recommend it to all my friends, however it is not the kind of place you take grandma
We had a lovely dinner Monday night! This was my 3rd time dining with friends at Kion and as always we had a great time
Weekdays are less crowded, which I prefer
I recommend the lychee martini and any of the ceviches - definitely the best ceviche I've ever had (try crispy oysters!)
The prices are fair for manhattan and the service is better than most in the east village
went a couple of times, during the week i had no problem
and i would be one to complain if that wasnt the case On the weekend i did wait a bit to be sitted but when a place is happening, thats what you get
i should had made a reservation
love the music layout lights people and yes FOOD
sushi - ceviche great mix try the tuna steak
great autentic peruvian cuisine with a twist delicious!! awsome space bueatiful decor must see !!
at the moment you get in everything changes , spectacular decoration , two ambience in one , two bars one at the first floor and another one a the lower level , i went with seven friends , attention was good we placed our orders and took around 20 minutes , while waiting we had some drinks , pisco sour ,mojito , margaritas
they were great
Food was something out of this world , I tried the tiradito and it was amazing my friends had some tapas , fried succhine , dragon roll, grill salmon
after dinner we went downstairs atmosphere was completely different , nice crowd , we stayed there more time than expected
something else , next time i will go with my girlfriend , they have these candles on the wall at the first floor that gives a section of the restaurant a romantic atmosphere
came here with 10 friends on friday night  everything was perfect
food is heaven  we were greeted by the hostess and sat down immediatly the space was very crowded and and we decided to order drinks promptly food can wait
we thought drinks were great and they kept coming great ambiance and very cool crowd seems like everyone was having one big party service was very good and our waiter was very helpful and charming everyone should give this restaurant a chance you definetly wont regret it
I had a group of 10 people in from out of town
45 minutes to get our first drink
waiter didn't even come over we had to go and ask him
not only could we not hear him from the speaker blarring music into our ears when we asked if he could maybe just turn it down that is not up to you that is up to the manager we ordered about 20 dishes, maybe got 12 of them (almost 2 hours later, had to go to the bar and get drinks)(they didn't even bother to let us know) they just brought us other stuff and said sorry, try this
the table next to us had the same situation
what a waste of a dinner and money
trust me there are soooooo many better places that are worth while and know how to take care of guest
The food was medicore, definately not worth the price, small portions! We waited 2 hrs for our food to come! and the seats were quite uncomfortable! We had 13 people some of us got their food while most didn't
The waiter came over told us that our food didnt come b/c they usually bring out the appetizers first
That's a lie b/c some already ate their steaks, and I didnt even get my appetizer! Then they said the kitchen forgot our orders
We didnt get to leave that place until 3 hrs after, even though they offered us drinks on the house, it does not help that we missed our event that cost us a bundle more
He also offered us free desserts but we didnt want to stick around for another hour for that to come
It was the WORST service I've ever experienced
awsome just awsome!!! food is spectacular
they added some more decor to the space along the bar which called my attention as soon as i walked in
the food is the best in the city
nothing to envy big restaurants such as nobu or sushi samba highly recommend it
sorry the other reviewer had a bad experince
it happens
party of 8 for dinner-birthday celebration, we had reservations for 8:30
we weren't seated until 9:10
We ordered cocktails such as pisco sour, margarita, mojito, martini it took 25 minutes for drinks to come to the table
new bartender our waitress explained
to compensate for the mishap they gave our table champagne with dessert
we had tapas shrimp w/garlic sauce, dragon roll, fried zucchini, blue potatoes w/feta cream and all were good
entrees also
grilled chicken mash chimichurri, grilled salmon, ceviche sampler, skirt steak chimichurri was overdone, we had a great waitress but she seemed to be overwhelmed
afterwards you simply walk downstairs
no cover dance the night away
the atmosphere and design is high tech cool, impressive
the crowd in the club was a bit wierd
the music was really great brazilian groovy but it was a bit of a freak show but entertaining watching lots of gringos try to get their latin groove on
The good - Sushi roll is very fresh, and the ceviche dishes are big
We ordered 4 ceviche dishes 2 rolls for 2 people, and it's one dish too many
Service was attentive, but then there was only 3-4 tables filled on a Sat night
The bad - Drinks are horrible
Saketini is by far the worst I had in town
Expensive dishes for what they are
Entree lists just don't match the cuisine (pork chop in a Japanese fushion place?)
Avacado in almost everything
The decor was just OK, a little chessy
I would come here for drinks next time, and stick to wine / sake instead of cocktail
$120 for 2, and it's just not worth the price, esp in this neighborhood
Went to Kion for Valentines; was very excited to try a new restaurant in the area, only to find that we'd been before when it was Industry! We ordered several of the tapas dishes to share but they all arrived at once though and wouldn't even all fit on the table! I really wish they would have staggered the dishes because by the time we got around to eating the steak it was cold
The rest of the tapas was OK, nothing too special but no complaints
The whole thing was over in 45 minutes until we ordered more cocktails to try to make the experience there longer as the place is quite cool inside
Overall I can't say I would rush back as there are plenty of places like this in NYC for less money
I'm a big fan of lychee martinis and Kion outdid themselves by adding Chambord to the recipe
I went on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't packed at all
The service was great and the food was oustanding
Try the Kion salmon
The best thing of all is the ambience
The set up is great
the lighting works
and the place seems to give off good energy
I didn't know what to expect from a dining lounge, but I was happily surprised
The decor is really well done - stylish, modern, comfortable
The food was really good and didn't break the bank
I was there on Saturday night and they played brazilian music to the wee hours
Will be going back to Kion for sure
We give Kion Dining Lounge low ratings
The food was a low mediocre, not great
The sushi was better than the entrees but definitely not some of the best in town
The service was poor - we ordered a pork tenderloin which came as a pork chop
When we asked the waitress if the wrong dish had been delivered she asked us what's the difference?
We think they put tenderloin on the menu and served chops
The atmosphere is cool (but the tables where you sit on the floor are not very comfortable)
Definitely try other places before this one
I ordered the many bean soup
It tasted good; however, it is not worth $6
95 per bowl
There are plenty of other good soups available in the neighborhood at a fraction of the cost
I work in the neighborhood and have come to rely on soup from the Soup Man on a regular basis
No doubt, the lobster bisque will knock your socks off, but you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't try some of the other options, specifically the sausage gumbo and the veal ghoulash really lit my fire

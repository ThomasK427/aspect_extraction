The atmosphere is great for groups and the 2 -story Buddha, fountain, and very high ceilings add an overall dramatic touch to everything
After all this time Tao is still one of the most lively places to go in NYC
Whether you make a reservation for a table, or eat at the bar upstairs, it is consistantly bustling (even during a snow storm that had most of the city quiet this place was pumping)
Tao epitomizes restaurants which are sought after, have long wait times and you wonder what all the excitement is about
Its definitely not about food
For me, the high ceilings, the Buddha statue and beautiful lighting did it
The setting is elegant- though the Buddha statue looks weary and not serene
I visited with a friend of mine on a Sat night and had a nice time only because I was with a good friend and Tao is beautiful place- and not because of above average food or attentive service
Music was exceptionally loud and I could not tell my friend what sauce should be used with the dumplings
I wouldnt come back but still recommend it to someone who values the wow factor
There is a certain thing about visiting restaurants where you allow food to become secondary and let the ambience take over and fill the void
My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the reasonably priced lunch prix fixe
We both ordered the duck spring rolls which were yummy
The kung pao chicken was awesome and so was dessert
We will definitely come back here for lunch and we'll have to try dinner as well
Table service was average
I must say i have been to many restaurants in manhattan
Tao by far is the best restaurant I have ever been to!! I brought my 72 year old italian father in law whom is very stubborn and closed minded about trying different foods other than italian cuisine and he left this place with a smile from ear to ear!! Not only did we love the food but the ambience is fantastic
when we got to our table we couldn't help but notice the huge statue of buddha
while we were looking around at the wonderful decor Robin Williams walked up to our table and introduced himself to us!!! In all we had a great experience!
Having dined at Tao twice before, we were looking forward to our third visit
The wait (despite reservation) was 35 minutes (in an over-crowded bar) no apologies whatsoever
Seated by a moody hostess and presented a menu that included live food-samples
Everything was rushed to the table (coffee/tea spoons literally thrown to us)
Taste remained unchanged although attention to detail was gone
Filet was returned to the kitchen (full of sinew) again no apology
Attractive decor although the music was far too loud to facilitate normal conversation
The Tao food-factory remained consistent after the evenings lousy start
No apologies for obvious missteps and the filet showed up on the tab anyhow
Over-crowded - table-turnover obviously reigns - and apparent that Tao switched to cashing in on its (ever-continuing-although misplaced) popularity
Plenty of other places in NYC which (still) have the quality and appeal that Tao used to have
What an experience! The food was fantastic and wait staff was impeccable
Downside: I scheduled a corporate dinner in the skybox and I've gotta tell you, I do this for a living and never have I dealt with such snobby unappreciative special events hosts
I was treated as though it was a privelage for ME to have the honor of renting the skybox
Usually, it's the other way around
In addition, the front desk female hosts seem to have taken the same snob class as the special events coordinators as they too stand around in solemn faces and seem annoyed that they have to serve you
We were 10 minutes late they felt the need to remind us we had a 2 hr limit before they needed the table
despite the $1000 check with auto added 20% gratuity! Its no wonder the wait staff seemed to be all male!
so the great tao turns out to be filled w tourists and kiddies! yes pull hard on the heavy outside door and enter a super dimly lit bar area and then cont further inside to see tourists w their fanny packs and kids hanging around
never have i seen sooo many kids come out of a cool trendy restaurant before
overall if u dont mind that, the place isnt too bad
the usual pricey martinis are only ok, the lychee was mad sweet, stick w the tao love potion
the food was not bad, the molten chocolate cake was pretty good but theres a lot of coconut w that cake for some reason, i guess its supposed to remind you that they are asian and fusion and all that
but not a bad place to hang out and throw back a few drks after some shopping on 5th =P
I absolutely loved this place! Every aspect of this restaurant was phenomenal!!!! The hype is well-deserved
You have to go at least once! It's a different experience as a restaurant
Great music, beautiful people, great service
except the part where you don't get seated right away even WITH a reservation
It's worth visiting
I took a client to Tao not expecting to get in but to our delight, we were able to be seated at the bar upstairs witha full menu
I found the food to be delicious and the bartenders/service responsive, which as busy as they were, I was surprised
Overall a good experience for a Tuesday evening
the place was packed
I was a bit surprised the we couldn't get seated at a table for 3 hours and it almost forced me to go to another restaurant
but again, we made it work and enjoyed thre evening there
The host staff was not very accommodating either
Aren;t we all tired of host staff's the are indignant to customers?! What is it with New York restaurants?
Manhattan offers too many resturants that offer better food and better service for the same price
SKIP IT
Don't make the same mistake I did
A business colleague and I thought we would stop in and talk shop over a light meal
They threw us upstairs to a make shift sushi bar in the back corner
This is understandable since we weren't having a big dinner
The waitress couldn't give us any reccomendations and ignored us most of our stay
Food was mediocre at best
I would not reccomend the seaweed salad
The cherry on top was when they had two new girls who had nowhere else to sit but our seats, the hostess had them stand within one foot behind us and wait while we paid
Ambiance is stunning
However, ambiance is probably the only reason why people still visit this restaurant
I was in NYC with a huge group of friends
We made reservations for ten people and were seated quickly
We only had to wait about 20-30 minutes
The food was awesome
Everyone ordered a different plate and we all shared
Everything I tried, I loved!!! The crowds are heavier on Fridays and Saturdays so we went on Sunday night and it was not crowded at all
The services was awesome and the food came out very fast
It's a bit pricey but totally worth it
I also have a lot of other friends that have eaten there and loved it
I loved Tao
I made reservations about 5 or 6 days in advance, and they had our table ready within 15 minutes of arrival
It was the perfect amount of time to enjoy a drink and do a little people watching at the bar
There were only two of us dining, so we shared two appetizers and split an entree
Everything was melt-in-your-mouth delicous
The seabass was the best I've ever tasted and the lobster dumplings were to die for
Our waiter was courteous and attentive, and our bill (including two Tao-tinis) was only $88
I will definitely go back
I'm not one to be into the type of scene perpetuated by the lounge-like atmosphere and young-professionals crowd
However, despite the hype and the throngs of fridays and saturdays, I have been really delighted with the food, service and over all experience of Tao
The chilean bass is something I have come to dream about
The cocktails are also wonderful
And as an overall experience, the noisy, dimly-lit scene is something that, while not a reason for me to go, doesn't stop me from coming repeatedly (especially on a low-key Sunday)
foods not bad but its not great
this place is definitely hyped up and the crowd has become very bridge and tunnel
i still love the buddha and the food comes out SUPER quick
but sometimes it feels a little too much like a factory that churns out food and drinks as opposed to an intimate dining experience
anyway
food is fine
people watching is fabulous!
Just went this past Saturday for a girlfriends birthday!!!!! Everything was great- minus a couple of slick remarks from the waiter!!!!! Overall, Tao is a definite must-try!!!!!!
Tao is a very stylish place, great interior

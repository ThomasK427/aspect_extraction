The ambience is perfect for any occasion - intimate dates, brunch with friends, and even family gatherings
The dessert is fantastic and the two-sauce shrimp alone is worth coming for
Such a gem!
We went on a wed
night, so it was not crowded at all and we got a seat right away
I found the menu to be more asian than french, but that's ok
The staff was friendly, the prices were good and so was the food
The place is pretty cozy so it might not be good for a large group, but the bar was good
The kiwi mojito was great!
We had Mojitos at the bar bf dinner this Saturday and they were wonderful! Busy place, but with a familiar attitude
Very friendly welcome, nice bartender and waitress
Food was delightful, if somewhat strange
In a good way strange! We'll be back as soon as we're in Brooklyn next time!
The food was delicious, and the service courteous and prompt
For the most part, the menu is Chinese ingredients with French preparation, and it works
The appetizer specials when I was there were excellent
The wine list is decent, and the cocktail menu is terrific
ok, so the food is good, but we loved the super friednly, yet not overbearing service! One waitress spoke weird English, but it was cute anyways
The cute bartender served us in the bar and was SO friednly and entertaining
Awesome dim sum, good entees
Nice vibe, we'll be back, !!
Fantastic place!!! Everything from their decor to their excellent food dishes to their service was phenomenal
Eat here for asian with a delightful twist
The atmosphere is romantic and loungy, but you can dress casual to eat here
Try the $17 prix option--it's a fantasic sampleing of their dishes
The atmosphere at Chance is pleasant and the service was excellent
We both had a $17 Prix Fixe which was a real bargain for the quality
Try the fried squid if they have it
Chance is a wonderful place
The drink menu is interesting and creative, filled with items like kiwi mojitos and raspberry L
I
iced teas
The food is always excellent in both preparation and presentation
Their miso and hot and sour soups are both the best Ive had
While Chance is great for multi course meals with drinks and deserts you can also walk out of there full and happy with a $15 check
I went there with a friend, and were the only people in the place, but for some reason the waitress ignored us and we ended up being served half the time by the bartender who was excellent(and cute!) We tried the prix fixe menu, they have 2 choices 1726, both started out great but my ribeye was awful I had to send it back, it was inedible, they were nice about switching it for the shrimp, which was good, desert(souffle) was absolutely amazing! Kiwi Mohitos fantastic too! The dim sum menu has some great stuff , the pot stickers were awesome at $2 for 3 a great deal! The Ocean box dim sum was also really good! If they had better servers the place would be nearly perfect
The prices are very reasonable and the decor is fun
I will definetly go back, but I will sit at the bar!
we could just eat at home some bananas and drink water
we could go to china town and had much better chinese food and pay less $$ or we could go to the next door asian resto, which is much better,and has an atractive menu
we had the seviche
(chinese seviche???)
and foie-gras (same?!?) then we had the shrimps -was very good, and the miso-cod - was o
k the dessert - forget about it
service was less than the service you get at K-mart
drinks where nice and creative !
the chef at chance is very creative in his combination of french and asian food
he is very creative, the foie gras is excellent, black cod and miso, fried oysters amonst other things
they think out of the box
service is sometimes a little slow but the food compensates
have had dinner for 2 there plus a party of 10, so very surprised by the other reviews
ask to speak to the head chef directly, he always welcome feedback
Out of the myriad of restaurant choices on Smith street, I made the mistake of eating lunch at Chance
While the decor is interesting, the service and food are not worth even a single visit
With only 2 tables occupied in the whole place, the waitress spent her time behind the bar and only came to help us when we got up and asked her to
The spring rolls were some of the worst I've ever had, really oily with no flavor, and the dim sum dumplings were not much better
The box lunches have decent portions but lack in flavor
Not a good choice!
When you think of 'Asian Fusion' Restaurants the Name Chance should pop right into your head
If you haven't visited 223 Smith street in the heart of the trendiest growing brooklyn neighborhood then its time to now
While dining there with friends I found the atmosphere inticing and the food equisite
We enjoyed a courtious wait staff with timely service; need I say more
The menu speaks for itself as we enjoyed the 3 course Prix Fix menu with a price that cannot be beaten! The new Dim Sum menu with a Foie Gras Dumpling and a lobster and spinach dumpling beats all I have tried in China Town
Visit Chance for an evening of food, fun and friends!
Chance is a wannabe 80s chic restaurant
The decor is tacky, the waitstaff is overly-solicitous and the food is horrible
The lobster paired with polenta would seemingly be an interesting combination, but they somehow managed to overcook both to the point of being inedible
If you are going to serve small portions, you better have the most exquisite taste combinations that will satisfy the pallet, they don't even come close
Do yourself a favor and dont take a chance
We ate here a month after this place opened,its been awhile
But,i recall the food was excellent and the service was excellent too
The chef came to our table to say hello and wanted to know if we were happy
We sat outside in their patio
This is one of the more expensive places on Smith,but reasonable considering the food and service
The food was inconsistent at best - all the seafood ordered by our large group was probably caught the week before
The lobster may have been caught last year (the highest priced entre and literally the worse lobster i have ever tasted)
Elaborate garnish and pseudo-chic miniature portions did nothing to cover up the mediocre quality (or my appetite)
This restaurant felt like a NYC compromise - people don't move to Brooklyn for a cheaper NY, they move to Brooklyn for a whole other, unique experience
After many years of living in New York and grappling with large crowds, obnoxious service, and mediocre/overpriced food - a bunch of us ventured into one of the other boroughs
(Some of you may know it as Brooklyn)
Chance is a hip, cozy but classy dining experience with top-notch food and a sleek kickin' bar (great kiwi mojito)
The chef even came from the kitchen at the end of the night to meet us! Thanks Chance for restoring my faith in New York City nightlife and dining
WE BOOKED A B-DAY PARTY FOR 10 AND ASK TO CHANGE IT TO 13 THEY SAID YES AND CALLED US BACK A HALF HOUR BEFORE TELLING US THAT THEY CANT ACCOMODATE US!!!!! WE HAD PEOPLE DRIVING FROM LONG ISLAND AND THEY WONT KNOW UNTIL THEY GET HERE THE DINNER IS CANCELED
I GUESS THE JOKE IS ON US
SO THIS IS A B-DAY WE WONT FORGET THANKS CHANCE A GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION FOR 13 PEOPLE AND THIER FRIENDS AND FAMILY
THE JOKE WILL BE ON THEM WHEN WE SPREAD THE WORD
LOL
Great place to take your Valentine - especially since they had a special menu that pulled out all the stops but remained tastefully elegant
The wine pairing with each course was perfect
And the staff are very relaxed in a nice and cute way
This is our first exploration of Smith St
together and it looks like Chance made it to our A-list
Here's hoping they do something special for their one year anniversary in April '05!

We took a chance on Chance and had dinner there a few nights ago, and were really pleased
The atmosphere is serene and pleasant which we prefer to all the other crowded, nosiy places nearby
The French-Chinese fusion food was very tasty and inventive; the wine was good; and Sage the watier was fun and attentive
A very lovely alternative on Smith Street that we were very happy to come upon
We shall be returning
ok, start with the best foie-gras EVER !!! yeah, after tring those best ones at manhattan

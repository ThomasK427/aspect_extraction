The atmosphere is very nice, too
Not too many people and loud at all
The service was great, too
Would definitely go there again and would recommend to all my friends!
WHAT A GREAT PLACE
MY BOYFRIEND AND I SKIPPED THE ENTREES AND JUST ORDERED A BUNCH OF APPETIZERS SO THAT WE COULD SAMPLE THE CUISINE
THE BEEF DUMPLINGS ARE TO DIE FOR AND UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER EATEN
IT'S DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTING BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT THAT IT'S SCARY
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEIR DRINKS ARE REALLY GOOD TOO! ONE OF MY NEW FAVOURITES! A GREAT PLACE TO GO WHEN YOU'RE TIRED OF INDIAN OR JAPANESE IN THE AREA! ONLY DRAWBACK
THE WAITERS ARE A LITTLE COLD
I have found the food at Turkish Kitchen to be very tasty and consistent
The dark red tone of the walls make the ambience kind of depressing
They could have done a better job
Staff is kind and attentive
As of Aug 2002 the restaurant was open only for dinner
Might not be the best pick for families with very young kids
Excellent main course, mediocre deserts and sub-par staff
I hope thist is not the beginning of the end
After all there are a lot more Turkish restaurants in the City now
Complementary champagne and a jazz cello made Sunday brunch all the better
First time here and it was very very good
Service was a bit slow at first but the food certainly made up for it
The lamb shank special was cooked perfectly and the seafood risotto was truly one of a kind
Not to mention the side of polenta which was cooked as it was intended
Best part they dont try to rip you off, great food at a good price
My sister and I had brunch at Pasticcio last weekend
We waited 45 minutes for our meal to arrive, and watched as other tables came in after us, got served, and left
We didn't even receive refills on our coffee! Finally, I asked if there was a problem in the kitchen
The waiter rudely replied that they were very busy
please be patient
Honestly, there were a total of 7 tables in the restaurant, with 3 waiters serving them
THAT'S busy?! When my eggs over easy finally arrived, they were fried and cold
A joke
We won't be returning
This is one of my favorite inexpensive Italian restaurants
I've been going here regularly for almost five years
Almost all of the dishes are quite good--particularly their daily specials
The drinks are stiff and the service is very friendly
They have a nice brunch
The place is small, but it can accommodate large groups--if you make reservations in advance
I've eaten here by myself, and with as many as 15 people and I've never had a problem with the service or the food
This is the type of place, where if you come in regularly, they will recognize you and remember what you like
I often order off the menu and in many ways, this restaurant is like an extension of my kitchen
Let me especially recommend the risotto primavera--it's not on the menu, but as long as the place isn't packed, the chef will make it for you
Food is good, but service is iffy if you don't order a starter and they think you aren't a big spender
Charming little place, very much of a neighborhood spot
Sauce described as spicy was not even remotely so, but still tasty
Tiramisu and cappucino were divine
I went there for New Years Eve and it was one of the best New Years Eve's I've ever had
Warm, family/friend -oriented and fun
The owner and staff were wonderful and the food was excellent
I would absolutely recommend this restaurant/wine bar
Chinese food at a good price
The soups are usually really good (though the chicken is a bit bland), as Noodles are the specialty
Everything else is still quite good
I reccommend the curry if you're not into a soup dish
You're not going to really take it to the top with lunch here, but it's still a great little spot!  Good for just a couple people or lots, you'll still be seated in 5 mins even if you come at the height of lunch
Have fun and watch who they offer chopsticks to first if you come in a mixed race party
I visited the new Noodles on 28th that just opened on 29th street and 3rd avenue (a block up from the one listed)
The restaurant appears clean and the food was fine until my dining partner discovered pieces of chicken about half way through her vegetarian dish
We complained about this and the waiter simply nodded her head and walked away
We asked for the check and noticed that we had been charged for the dish despite the error
I spoke to the manager who said all she could do was make us another serving to go
I'm definitely not going back for this overpriced chinese food
Noodles on 28 supposedly serves the best Chinese outside of Chinatown, but it's one of the worst places EVER
I've attempted to give this place chance after chance to only be consistently disappointed
Though portions are large, the food ranges from mediocre to absolutely poor
Our First encounter we figured it was an off day for the chef and decided to give them another chance
This time, we asked specifically if they knew how to prepare Mapo Tofu, they stated yes, but when the dish arrived, it was just bland tofu, the dish was prepared completely wrong, but since it was edible, we let it slide
The next attempt was with Singapore noodles
I've heard of al-dente noodles, but this was beyond that!! They gave us an enormous order of dry, hard noodles
It was just inedible
Save you money and your stomach and go ANYWHERE else
It's shocking how rude their waitresses are! They sat next to our table while we were dining, sorting some vegetables and talking to each other loudly
They even talked loudly about how some customers tip them more than others, which made us extremely uncomfortable
The food is average, the place is often crowded and noisy, there isn't any separation between the kitchen and dining areas
Staff walk in and out of the kitchen area right in front of your table with dirty water buckets all the time
One of the water glasses on our table looked dirty
I would not recommend this place to anybody
We considered this to have classic good chinese food
The service isn't to nice but they are quick and efficient
The price was very inexpensive
We would recommend this to anyone who would like to enjoy chinese food
Well i come from Los Angeles, and anyone who's been to Alhambra/Monterey Park know that Asian food is the best there
So of course i didn't have high expectations for this place
I was here because i wanted a break from the pizza and hot dogs
The waitress really rec'd the dumpling special which consisted of 10 assortments: mushroom, veggie, pork and dimsum siumai
I tried the wonton soup noodles: bland, but good for those w/ hangovers
I honestly thought they bought the frozen kind and steamed it for us
So if Chinatown is too far and you want to stay under the $10 cap
come here
I order from here atleast 3 times a week
The food is soo good, fresh, and lite
The people are always really nice as well
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, cheap meal
I lived a few blocks from Noodles on 28 for about 3 years and it was by far my favorite local Chinese place and definitely better than Sam's down the block
The Steamed Chicken Dumplings with Sesame Sauce are AMAZING and better than any others I've ever had
Noodles is great
I have been going there consistently for the past few years and they are always attentive, friendly, and have GREAT food
The soup noodles are fantastic as are the dumplings

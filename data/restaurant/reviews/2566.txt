Basically I'm trying to figure out what all the hubbub is that would result in a 9
0 from CitySearch! My experience was a thumbs down
You're better off going to any number French Bistros down in the village or around the city IMO
On top of that it's extremely close seating
The place is tiny
Other people on top of you
The food was not outstanding at all and the service was average
I would never go again
The one plus is Gene Bertoncini's guitar work--if you manage to get a table near him
we came here for brunch on a saturday afternoon
the waitress was very courteous
she gave us an opinion of what she liked at this little french place
i took her advice and i'm glad i did
if you're heading there for brunch, go for the frittata
you'll be glad you did
there is one thing i was disappointed about
the coffee was lukewarm
Booked reservations based on readers' reviews and the food definitely lived up to its reputation
However, the waitress was unbelievably bossy and controlling; I believe she may suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, as it seemed very distressing to her when we did not order our food in just the right way
Extremely odd behavior! Too bad for an otherwise wonderul restaurant!
After making a reservation for three people weeks in advance and confirming it the day before we were met by a rude host who insisted the reservation was for two
After saying, Well, that's gonna be a problem, he did not say a single word to us
Then after a few uncomfortable minutes he showed us to a table
Never saying a word
Did I mention that we arrived at 4:45 p
m
and there was only one occupied table in the place
Our waiter was not what you would call warm
I think he was actually bothered that we were there
The food however was exceptional and the price-fix theater menu was great
Get rid us the snooty, couldn't be bothered help and this place could be a jewel
My favorite salmon in town
but I've recently sampled the steak and duck, fantastic
Try for the garden room if possible, its very cozy
Great ambiance
try to get seated in the garden Food was very good
Service was good
Make a Reservation!!! It gets crowded during dinner/theatre times
I choose this place for my last date based largly on the reviews on this site and I must say it ivd up to it's billing
The food was great (although the arugala in the arugala salad needs to be chopped) the service was not fantastic but pretty good (inubtrusive, great on a date) and the ambience was perfect
Try the salmon - I was a bit concerned about the fennel - but this dish's combination of textures and flavors left me wanting more
I will definetly go back for another visit
Came here for brunch a while ago
I liked the space, though it pushed on the faux French a little too hard
The food was, well, fine, but nothing to write home about
Maybe it's different in the evening, but I'd give this a 7/10 rather than the (approx) 9/10 it gets on average
This wonderful little bistro in the theatre district was recommended by my parents
They weren't wrong
We sat in the charming garden room-- completely full and a bit loud but not overwhelming
Service was excellent
Both of us had the duck, which was delicious, perfectly cooked and accompanied by a wonderful polenta and a sort of sour cabbage
This was an excellent value and a wonderful dinner experience
In fact, we've already made a reservation to go back!
We sat in the garden room
I had a appetizing mixed green salad, chicken w/ great mashed potatoes and a pretty good creme brulee
Waitress was nice but didnt know some specials and was alittle off, think she was new
Overall a plkeasant experience
We had a great time when we took my friend out for lunch for her birthday! We sat in the garden room, which is open year round very nice! The little fountain in the back, and even though it the place was full it wasn't loud or stuffy
The gazpacho was GREAT!! Never been a big fan but would come back again just for that
The food was very good the service was very friendly!!
It was recommended by a friend and boy was she right on! The ambience is sweet, the garden room is beautiful, but you are there for the wonderful food
The Crisp Spicy Duck was sublime, but leave room for dessert
Have the Valhrona Chocolate and Carmel Mousse or the Lemon Custard
They will use up all your points for the week but it is worth it
You can also find a very nice wine for a reasonable price
Go there and tell all your friends!
I was not impressed at all with this restuarant
My rib-eye was way over cooked (burned is more like it)
The service was not to par - had to ask for water refills
Hubby liked his chicken and my son was satisfied with the salmon
The bread was cold and hard
No salad was offered with entree
I would not recommend this place
I couldn't sit in the garden room due to a private party - but I did see empty tables the whole time I was there
I have dined in a fair number of French restaurants in Manhattan, low-end to high-end
The nicest thing about Le Madeleine is its location (Theatre District) and its escape routes, including some very fairly priced prix-fixe dinners
You'll spend about 20 for an entree, 10 for an appetizer, and 10 for the wine
Tax and tip will bring it to 50
The black bean soup was uninspiring, the lamb was obvious but nicely done
I appreciated the amuse-bouche from the maitre-d' even if it tasted like hummus from the store
Service - our waitress was positively frightened that we would return the salmon if cooked medium rare
Even after assuring her we wouldn't, she repeated herself, not once, not twice, but three times
But the wait staff is pretty good for a bistrot
Our water was filled untold times
The restaurant is roomy, clientele older and seemingly in-the-know
Fabulous Food, Wonderful Wine Enticing ambiance
Awesome alliterations right!!! This place was great all around
The only thing that could make it better would be if the hostess wasn't so snooty! Not as bad as Abe Froman, the sausage king snooty, but if she keeps it up she might get there
Otherwise this place is Fantastic
Excellent French bistro--from wines and bread to appetizers and main dishes to desserts
Waiter so nice and helpful; lovely atmosphere
Would definitely go back in the near future
I love this place
everything is great there
the food, drinks, service
one of the best restaurant in Manhattan for sure
And try to go to the garden it's beautiful!!!
If only there was a restaurant this good in New Haven
Been going almost monthly for over a year now, and yet to be disappointed; in fact, always pleased
If you plan far enough in advance the garden room is an added delight

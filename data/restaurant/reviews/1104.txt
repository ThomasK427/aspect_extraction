She sort of hovered until we made up our minds
She was pretty distant and there was no more friendliness toward us for the night
She took our dinner order while on the phone, and at one point stopped listening to continue to chat with her buddy (it was clearly not a work-related call)
We opened all our wine bottles by ourselves, because she was slow to come around
We switched from a red to a white, but she didn't give us more glasses, saying that they were out (but she did grudgingly offer to wash our current wine glasses for us; we declined)
The food was out of this world good
We had the mushroom cigars, which were so good that we actually ate every bit of the crumbs
I also had the tuna tartare, which was amazing
And I don't even like tuna
We ordered the lamb, filet mignon, and steak frites (2 of us got that)
Everything was cooked to order (my medium steak was pink in the center, just the way I like it)
I ended up leaving my sweater there by accident, and called back to see if the waitress could hold it for me until I came back
She said that she couldn't see it, but that she's keep an eye out for it
Yeah, right
The entire restaurant is only 10 feet long
As soon as I walked back in, I saw the sweater, right by where I'd been sitting
Like I said, go there for the food - you will not be let down
As long as you know that you'll have fair to terrible service, you shouldn't be disappointed with your meal!
Great brunch
Good bread
Wonderful coffee
And the food tastes great
Only one waiter, so he is pretty busy
Tiny restaurant that serves delicious food
Friendly staff that makes you feel like you're a regular even if it's your first time there
Great place for a date
Best peanut butter pie in New York!
My husband found this lovely little restaurant in the Zagat guide
It was highly rated, and it lived up to it's rating
We had the mushroom cigars and tuna tartare to start, both fantastic
My husband had the rack of lamb and I had the vegetable pasta, again, both fantastic
Don't forget the peanut butter pie
Everything was perfect, lovely waitress, wonderful food, BYOB
Highly recommended!
I chose Nook because finding places to eat in the theater district is difficult and the Zagat's rating was decent
Our dinner party of four all found the food better than average and of sizeable portions
Unfortunately, the service dictates that I'll never go back
They don't have their liquor license and the waittress told us to stop drinking water because after our first refill she was tired of filling up our glasses
It's a very small, cramped, stuffy venue with maybe 12 tables
We were chided for not deciding what we wanted to eat fast enough and because part of our party was 10 minutes late for our reservation
After we left, the place was practically empty
Reading some of the other posts here, I see I didn't have an isolated incident
Would you put up with the cramped space and rude waitress
Food is good for the price
but they need to send the waitress back to waitress school
Talk about a wonderful find
My girlfriend first found Nook so we went before a show on Broadway and I instantly liked the intimate atmoshpere here
After the delicious and large portion of Filet and the Tuscan chicken, all we could think of was when could we get back here
I now go back on a monthly basis and have recommended it to all my friends that are looking for a place before a show
For an appetizer, get the Mushroom cigars and if that isn't good go for the Tuna Tartare
And finish off the night with a slice of Peanut Butter pie
Oh and its BYOB, so bring your bottle of wine
All told (if you include a $15-20 bottle of wine), you are looking at $85-90 night
Who knew a night on Broadway could be so affordable!
Don't come expecting fancy ambiance or cheery service
Come expecting very good comfort food, well prepared and extremely tasty
The price was right, and the proportions were plentiful
BYOB is a big plus
No revs needed, as there seems to be a pre-theater crowd
Walk in at 6pm or 7:45pm and you should be fine
Comparison: Westville, sans flies, sans hot dogs, sans florescent lights
Been here twice, and both times i wanted it to be great
Unfortunately, it fell flat both times
Place is TINY
thus the name; but that's ok
There are a lot of great tiny places in NY
The service is BAD!! There was one girl working the floor (maybe 6 tables) and she really didn't know anything about the menu
Every question was answered by lemme go check
After a 45 minute wait for the appetizers, I asked the waitress to check on the apps
She replied they're not ready yet
The actual entrees are pretty good, untortunately it takes an hour to get them
If you do decide to come here- don't come hungry, do bring multiple bottles of wine, and be prepared to wait
If you want good cheap eats in Hell's Kitchen, go to Market Cafe on 38th and 9th, or Pigalle on 8th 48th
Very good food in a very casual atmosphere for a very inexpensive price sums up this restaurant
Yes, the service can be a little haphazard due to only one person working the front of the room and maybe two the back, but this is the only way a restaurant this size and price can work and the people who go there usually recognize that fact
All the food on the small menu is very tasty and the desserts are superb
Net-net, I'd definitely go back
Eating dinner at Nook last night was a terrible
experience
Our food took 40 minutes to arrive
We were starving
I thought I would eat my napkin
We devoured our bread basket, which didn't come with enough butter, or bread plates, for that matter
We ate off the table and brushed our crumbs on the floor
We were being ignored and there was next to no one in the place
No one approached our table during the 40 minutes that we waited for our food to arrive
No one acknowledged the fact that the food took 40 minutes to arrive
It was downright offensive
After receiving our food, I wanted some steak sauce, and some salt and pepper for my (very bland) mashed potatoes
But no one ever came back until we were finished
The whole (expensive) meal was flavorless and very disappointing
Everything is always delicious
Definitely try the mushroom cigars for starters but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu
Fries are super tasty
The restaurant is *very* small so call ahead if you're going to be more than a party of two
Service is always friendly
Two starters Crab Cakes and Stuffed Mushrooms
Burger (quite delicious), Salmon, One very good Chocolate mousse
$63
BYOB

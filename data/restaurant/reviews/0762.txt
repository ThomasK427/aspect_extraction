You won't believe your at 2nd Ave
and 96th St!
Sufficed to say that the Upper East Side is not known for it's excellent culinary offerings, but this changes everything
The space is classy, upscale, and contemporary
The service is upbeat and professional; on par with any of the 5-stars here in Manhattan
And, most notably, the food is literally to die for
Traditional Latin/Cuban/Puerto Rican favorites are served alongside new and interesting creations, courtesy of reknowned chef Rene Hernandez (whom I personally thanked after my meal) Both the preparation and presentation are of the highest caliber
Try a traditional latin favorite like Arroz con pollo (yellow rice w/ chicken red bell pepper) but meat lovers should definitely not miss out on the churrasco! The secret needs to get out about this place
Definitely go for the specials
Our appetizer was a roasted pepper stuffed with a rice
Awesome
She had the trout, loved it
I had the pork, beans, rice, jalapeno salad dish, great
Can't find words for how great the dessert was
Only down side was the first glass of wine was smaller than the second
I brought my family to Don Pedros for my mothers birthday and everything was perfect
The service, the food and the atmosphere were all outstanding
The owner went out of his way to accomodate the entire party
we could not have picked a better place
I am going to go back and I would recommend it to anyone
There were no complaints from the members of my party
Everyone liked their food and loved the Baked Alaska
I had the greatest culinary experience here this past weekend
The menu is creative, the food is ALL wonderful (we sampled it all I think) and it's something truly unique
Not to mention the drinks will take you back to spring break in college
You must try a mojita! Tell everyone you know to try this place because it's a real gem
In a few months it will be a well-known name around town
Kudos to the chef and waitstaff!!! Also, you must try the shrimp epinadas!
I will say at the outset that since I am a vegetarian that does not eat fish, this was perhaps not the best choice of restaurants as it has no non-meat or fish entrees
Forgiving that, I found three disappointments: 1) the look of annoyment I got from the waitress when I ordered my salad and a vegetable side dish, 2) the fact that my salad was comprised of no more than three pieces of iceberg lettuce artfully arranged and doused with dressing, 3) the mango sorbet w/passion fruit sauce - some of the best sorbet ever, but the sauce was in a puddle on the plate beneath the decorative dessert glass, with none on the sorbet, and nearly impossible to marry the two- a shame, because both were excellent
My boyfriend, however, ate every last speck of his pefect fillet of sole, hence the high marks for the retaurant
Don Pedro's is a very welcome addition to the Upper East Side
The food presentation is on par with any 5 star restaurant, and it tasts just as amazing as it looks
The atmosphere is relaxing, yet fun, and the owner and staff are extremely welcoming
This is a restaurant destined for greatness!
After living in the East 90's for 2 years, its nice to finally be able to have dining options other than Brother Jimmy's or the Barking Dog
Most restaurants in the area either suck or are too expensive
not only is Don Pedro's food great, but the prices are VERY reasonable and the atmosphere borders on actually being a downtown establishment
This place is a great value, especially if you like chicken or pork
the seafood's a bit more expensive, but still cheaper than the options you get at other restaurants
The verdict: if you like Spanish food in a classy setting at reasonable prices, make the trip--it'll be well worth your time!
At last, a great place for Latin American food on the Upper East Side
We've been here a few times, and it just keeps getting better and better
The food is amazing, and a bargain for the price
My girlfriend especially loved the decor, which she said was classy, yet comfortable
We'll be heading there again
This is a very classy establishment with very good price points
The food is excellent and unlike other establishments they don't jack the prices on you
I can see Don Pedro's being an excellent destination as well as a local favorite
I'm surprised there was nothing like this before in that area
I'm surprised that I haven't seen a place like this before in NYC; really good Latin/Caribbean food in an upscale, posh setting
The food is excellent, and there's great variety in both menu selection and prices
The staff was super-friendly; though with our big crowd there were one or two service issues (which may be due to the fact that they just recently opened
) Overall, though, a great experience - fun people, and great food and drinks; and not too pricey
A welcome and fresh addition to the Upper East side, amazing food, upbeat atmosphere, terrific menu!
I hosted a surprise dinner party at the Sidecar and it was FABULOUS! From the minute we walked in, to the second we walked out, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, comfortable and important
The restaurant atmosphere was ideal (quiet, spacious and comfortable) and the space was great for a large table
They even arranged a special prix-fixe menus specifically for our party
The wine (a glass never emptied) and food was delicious
The hostesses were so inviting and the wait staff was extremely attentive
I am so grateful for having found such a wonderful restaurant to host my event
I give this restaurant my highest recommendations for a group dinner
The Scene Are the gilded "goth gone wild" candelabras, gold frames and marble statues supposed to be tongue-in-cheek? The local professionals, theatergoers and dot-com daters can be seen scanning the curious space trying to figure that out
Service, when not bursting out with arias, is especially attentive and knowledgeable
The Food The kitchen draws diners' attention away from the decor and singing waiters with refined, rustic Italian fare
Exquisite "bocconcini del fornaio" features baked balls of creamy mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto and roasted peppers lightly dusted with bread crumbs and drizzled with arugula pesto
Charred brick-oven pizzas span the sharp (prosciutto, fig jam, Gorgonzola) to the mellow (tomato, mint, roasted garlic, mozzarella, grilled eggplant)
Especially good are pappardelle domenica, thick ribbons of homemade pasta dressed with braised lamb, pork, veal and beef
I just have last night a great Party
Everything was PERFECT
Everyone raved about the food and the service, they didn't want to leave
They make my Party such a pleasurable event
The best time of my life the food absolutly excellent my favor dished is the Boccocini mussels and as a main course the lobster with pasta Filet mignon is was great
The whole staff is was great from the managers to all the served
If you want to impress your date by romantic ambience this is the place for you
just dont eat anything!!! The pasta my date had was tough and inedible and my filet mignon was tender yet tasteless
Service was ok and so was the scenery, but really really bad food
My husband and I went to ReSette while visitng the city withour Daughter on Sept
25th, 2004
it was her first time in the city
she is 5 years old
SHE in fact picked the restaurant! This 5 year old was not only attracted to this restaurant immediately by the beautiful tapestry covered seating in the open to the street restaurant front as much as we were
but was treated (and acted) like a lady
the enitre experience was amazing
this incredible restaurant is perfect for the Romantic dinner and the discerning child's tastes as well
;)
I'm not a fan of theater district dining, but this place is the exception to my rule
Fabulous food, attentive service, cozy atmosphere
I can't wait to go back!
THE BEST Italian food I've had in years! Amazing atmosphere, gorgeous people at the bar and overall an exquisite experience
Great for after work or out for the night and chill music
everything was exquisite, the delicious entrees and dessert, the personable and attentive waitstaff, the pleasant ambiance, I will definitely go back! SIMPLY EXQUISITE
Re Sette is a great midtown find, without all the Theatre district rush
we went here for diner
This is on my top five list for most beautiful restaurants
The food was delicious
We stayed for drinks
The bar was wonderfull
Try the special martinis
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful

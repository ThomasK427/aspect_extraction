We sat in the lovely and romantic garden which I highly recommend
We had the Monday night prix fixe and it was delicious but, we encountered a number of unpleasant things aw well
First of all we ordered a wine from the menu listed as 2000 but the waiter brought the 2001 vintage and tried to pass it off as the 2000
Then one of my companinons told the waiter about an allergy to peas and then was brought a side of them with his meal--which had to prepared again
We found a greasy Hershey wrapper in our water carafe and they charged us for 2 desserts even though we got the price fixe
It could've been a lovely evening but it was ruined by these unpleasent experiences
Excellant food and service, perfect place to start off a romantic evening, especially in their outdoor garden
Great attention to detail across the board
Absolutely one of my favorite places in the neighborhood, as well as NYC overall
A must try, there is no way you'll be dissapointed
French fare at it's best
I went there last night and sat in the beautiful garden outside! The waiters were attentive but not pushy
hard balance to find in the city sometimes
Definitely a must for that romantic date!
Every night at 6 or 7, a gang of entrepreneurs, gym enthusuiasts, NYU Stern business students, and finance professionals collect in the back of Eva's on 8th street (between 5 and 6th Ave
) for a lively dinner conversation
We did it all last summer and we're back at it this year
Conversations revolve around business in general
For example, on Monday, we discussed why it is Business schools offer joint degree programs like the MBA/JD
We figured it was because the programs wanted to exploit the synergies between business and law -- and there are many
In the end, business and law -- and politics -- converge upon one common denominator
Decision making
All are welcome
I really enjoy going to this place
I found it about a month ago and have been going 1-2 times a week
Everything I've tried there has been pretty good
They have great soups, omelettes, falafels, pizza
it's delicious food
There are a lot of healthier options, and choices for vegetarians (and vegans?) and non-vegetarians
Prices are definitely reasonable - and they have great special combos - like $5
25 for a falafel and a drink plus the choice of soup, fries, or rice
Atmosphere is not so great, but that doesn't really bother me
Service is usually good
though sometimes it takes them a while to make the food, and they did mess up my order once
I have been going to Eva's for quite a while now, and I love Evas for food, and various supplements at good price
It's like a cafeteria, and I only have eaten in once or twice
I always take my food out, and my absolute favorite is Champion Plate
Mixed steamed vegetables, brown rice, lemon chicken, and pita
I usually split the plate into half, and add the hot sauce they have
Guilt free pleasure! Grab water from the back(supplement store with great selection, price and knowledgable stuff) and you feel much better after eating their food
Wandering around downtown on a sunny afternoon, I grew hungry, but didn't want something like Starbucks and certainly didn't want anything as unhealthy as pizza
While walking on 8th Street, I found Eva's, and am over the moon now that I had
While dining there, I was already plotting my return for when I can come back there to eat again
This is strictly a lunch cafe with zero ambience, but the prices and healthy cuisine make this just right by all means
I am excited to eat there again soon!
Very friendly and hardworking staff
Fantastic diner fare and a really great value
Could not be better
The Scene This Chelsea refuge welcomes with exposed brick walls, colored paper lanterns, smooth wooden furniture and an indoor fish pond
A long family-style table and inventive high-tea, sake-tasting and lunch box specials make it popular for parties, while the numerous loose teas and related sale items can be beautifully wrapped up for gifts
The Food In addition to dozens of exotic teas and blends (all cleverly described in handmade menus and steeped in the appropriate ceramic or glass pot), Wild Lily cooks up delicious, detail-oriented fare
Some items have an Asian flavor, such as dumplings, black tea egg salad and curries with seasoned rice; others, like butternut squash soup with cinnamon sticks and a lemony mixed green salad with pears and brown-sugared walnuts, are just plain yummy
Not-to-miss homemade desserts include green tea tiramisu, assorted cookies and perfectly textured scones
The ambience is great
The small pond with gold fish makes the place very cute
The tea sandwiches are light
Must try the salad with beets and goat cheese
The balsamic dressing is sweet and also has a blend of sesame flavor
The chicken salad is also good
The green tea pound cake was not as good as Sara Lee's pound cake, so skip it
The white tea was light and its flavor was light and dry to the taste
If you are on the west side visiting the galleries or shopping this is a great stop for a snack or light lunch/dinner
ive been wanting to try this place for a very long time, and my friend was nice enough to take me today
we shared the assorted tea sandwiches ($11
25) the sticky black rice risotto ($15)
i had the pink infusion tea ($6) one of the wild lily tea blends composed of pink flowers and jasmine tea
it was highly aromatic and very comforting
my friend had the yang gwei fei tea ($7) red tea infused with lychee juice
the sandwiches were small but i liked the alternative flavours such as butternut squash, shrimp salad, and satay chicken
the risotto with mushroom sauce was interesting but not great
we ended with a plate of homemade cookies ($6)
i would come again just for the ambience though theres a pond with running water, floating blossoms, and goldfish that makes for a very calming experience
we never felt rushed
been going here for many years and evidently the secret is out cuz it is getting hard to get in these days
GORGEOUS space with tranquil zen ambience (built in fish pond, need i say more?)
food is exceedingly fresh, thoughtfully prepared and tasty, tasty, tasty! they have your standard loose leaf teas but their specialties are what set them apart: fabulous cold tea concoctions in the summer and warm in the winter
(the tea latte is remakable
) the tea party is one of the best in the city (food wise AND value)
they take reservations so avoid the (increasingly long) wait and make them!
I came here both for tea and food
The place is out of the way, but definitely worth the walk
The teas are excellent
I particularly recommend the Morgan blend
For those looking for a cool, refreshing drink, the fruit tea is a wonderful choice
Some of the tea sandwiches were excellent - others just good
The other entrees were very good and well presented
The tea presentation is wonderful
The service could be a bit more coordinated, but it is very effective as is
I highly recommend this place
This is an adorable little tea house
but pretty far out to get to, still worth the trip at least once
Very quaint atmosphere and good tea
The appetizers are pretty good too
I invited 5 friends over to this place because of the reviews
The place is OK looking
After a hour of sitting down, three of us didn't get our cocktails
We had no water or napkins
We had tiny tea sanwiches that were so small and didn't work as appetizers
We also had shumai, tobu, etc which were nothing to rave about
That's when I realized how much we would have to spend to get full and buzzed from their tedious menu

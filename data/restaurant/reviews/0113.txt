g
too much residual oil in the gralic soup)
Like experimental theater, the results are uncertain and its not for everyone
That being said, I would go back
I made the mistake of not taking to heart the previous negative reviews, don't you
Though the room was cozy and the staff nice the place fell short on tasting
The portions are MICROSCOPIC and TOO EXPENSIVE
A warm salad was delivered cold and a mushroom tart was vinegary
There are only 10 wines available by the glass
We had to remind the waiter to pour our wine (white) and then he didn't show us the label
This is not snobby but something you should expect at these prices
I reiterate the staff is nice but this place is for East Village trustafarrians (SP?) and people who don't know any better
Another word for cramped is cozy and that's exactly what the Tasting Room is
Practically the size of a one bedroom NYC apartment, this vinaceously decorated joint has a deceptively large selection of wines that will complement any of the delicious meals served
Try the Pinot Blanco from Oregon (very clean and smooth taste)
The Tasting Room is exactly that: a place to challenge your taste buds and experience new flavors co-mingled with some old staples
If you are looking to stuff your face, McDonald's is conveniently located a few blocks down
Try the Monk fish to share
It's most delectable, but unfortunately, tasting portions are so small, they leave you feeling slighted and insatiable
The Tasting Room also boasts some great desserts to end the evening
I highly recommend experiencing the sweet wine cake w/ olive oil
you will thank me
After several courses and $75 later, I went home and ate a sandwhich (I was still hungry)
Most of the food was unusal and pretty good (not great), but I needed a microscope to see the portions (including the entrees)
I wouldn't go back
The Tasting Room was great
If you don't like experimentation, though, this is not the place for you
The point of dining here is to get several Tasting plates (two of us shared 5 @ $12/each and were quite full), and try as many of the dishes on the menu as possible
The chef makes these up as he goes along, day by day (menu is never the same twice, and very creative), so you never know what you're going to get
There is good and bad to this approach, as some dishes are incredible, while others leave you wondering where was he going with this? (but still good)
Only 25 seats, so you sit elbow to elbow with other diners
Service can't be beat
Chef will help you choose a wine, the servers go out of their way to accommodate your every request and check back on you often
I had the pleasure of dinner at The Tasting Room last night and it was a memorable meal
The intimate setting made conversations easy
The service was excellent with the staff offering wine and dinner suggestions
The portions were slightly small so for someone with a hearty appetite I suggest following their recommendation of two share portions per person
For a special night, I couldn't recommend a better place
The tasting room is a unique and wonderful restaurant
I would recommend only going with two people, though
The menu is always changing and each dish is very unique with things like squab, cornish game hen, and monkfish
The wine list and the service are both great, but be prepared for a very small space
I would also recommend the rice crispy ice cream sandwich for dessert
It was heavenly
The only thing that took me off guard were the prices and I felt it was a little too pricey, but other than that is was a great time
nothing can prepare you for the pampering you'll receive at this petite but eloquent eatery
The waitstaff is more personable and highly trained than any 5 star mid-town restaurant and the host makes you feel like one of their small family sitting down for an evening meal with them
The food is superb and their wine list is second to none in the realm of American wines
The table bread is better than most food I have had recenty in the city
Make the reservation and then take the time to relax and enjoy it, it is well worth the visit
The service was horrible
Called ahead requesting 2 glasses of champagne be given after we sat down for my wife's B-day
They never came
We waited a extremely long time to order
Our microscopic apps were done before we were asked if we'd like wine
Drinks arrived a good 25 minutes before our food arrived (No explaination on the delays)
The food
underseasoned and undercooked
Entree portions were very very small, the ox-tail needed to cook for another hour to be even remotely tender, and my wife's raw-in-the-center lamb dish still had string wrapped around it
We ordered cheese
The cheese plate costs more than the most expensive entree!!!! The only part of the meal that was great were the wines, and this was the only part of the meal the kitchen or the staff couldn't and didn't screw up
Avoid this place if you know anything about good food or service
There's no doubt that the food is expensive, but I thought it was worth every bite
Despite the fact that I forgot to confirm my reservation last Saturday, they kept our table, which was appreciated! My boyfriend and I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good
You won't be stuffed, but you will be satiated
Worth it for a special occasion, or when you have some extra $$$ to toss around!
This is my favorite place
The food and service are always excellent, the wine list is ever changing and interesting
The owners are always there and greet the regulars like family
Don't miss out
This Saturday night was our 3rd visit to the Tasting Room
As were the first 2, this visit was EXCELLENT
There is always something new on the menu, and always delicious
My wife and I tried a tasting portion of a mixed tomato salad and a edamame salad
Then moved on to a taste of blowfish tails
Finally we had a share portion of a Sea Bass, and a share portion of a roasted Rabbit, done perfectly
In other visits we have had the Venison Carpacchio, the Country Squab, and a very tasty salad of mixed young greens
The portions are perfectly sized
The service is excellent, staff is very friendly, and the bill is always very reasonable
We recommend it highly
Although the food is good, broken down for your convienence into the laughable tasting size and the larger but equally undersized sharing portion, make no mistake it's not worth the money
The waitstaff was helpful but watch out, after you pay your hefty bill managment will ask you to leave if they think you've lingered too long
for $240 you should be able to finish your coffee
I attended a private party for 700 at Guastavinos, and the venue couldn't handle it
There were almost no hors d'oeuvres
They ran out of sparkling wine within an hour of the party's start at 9PM
They didn't serve dinner until 10
30 when a few hundred people were making like vultures around the serving stations; it then became a mob scene
The food was boring, ordinary Italian
Dessert wasn't until midnight, and even then the caterers fought people off until someone (nobody knew who) gave an order
They had no cognac or port, and the spirits in the open bar were bottom-shelf
The arrangement of the serving stations was inefficient for replinishing food and silverware
The two-floor set-up is annoying; a pre-function space on the same floor (like at Capitale) is better
There is no covered entrance from the street; plan to get wet if it's raining!
Went to Guastivino's for dinner recently, having heard about it for years
The space is beautiful and romantic, but the food was nothing to write home about - the portions were very small, especially considering the price they charge
My steak was okay, but I've had far better at many other places
Dessert (the three pudding sampler and the tropical fruit foster with tres leches ice cream) was delicious, so I'd recommend it for just dessert or drinks
Don't believe the hype
Went there and was not a good experience

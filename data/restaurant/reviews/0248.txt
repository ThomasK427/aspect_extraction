Try the tuna tartar and the House Chows- good apps and large plates for sharing- order a bunch of things and mix it up
Great cocktail list and really reasonable wine list
Attentive service and our reservation was honored immediately
Great Asian food (even in Chinese Standard), great VAlue (average US$25~40) and excellent dining experience
Try the dumplings if you go
The food is pretty good but not great by any means
The restaurant was OK, not a winner
The decor was cheap looking and the service was so-so
The desserts were not very creative
Totally overrated
Food is good but average
Good place to bring a date - if you don't want to hear what the other person has to say
Way too loud! Trendy decor doesn't make up for the avg food, adequate service and relatively high prices
You can do better
Great great food! Friend and I went a few nights ago and to say the place was packed is an understatement! (Isn't there supposed to be a recession on?!) The poor (ie - extremely slow) service was a pain, but the wait was worth it
The atmosphere was electric however and it's located in a great part of town
Fun, loud, creative food
Great noodle bowls! The atmosphere is nice, a little crowded, and a loud bar
The waits aren't too bad without a reservation
The menu is creative and the food lives up to its promise
Went to chow bar last night for my birthday dinner w/some friends
it was an all around great experience
the staff was friendly and accomodating to our large party, we had some great summer cocktails-white sake sangria and watermelon martinis, definately recommend the calamari salad and tuna tartare as well as the carmelized beef w/shitaki mushrooms and lobster fried rice
Don't forget to order their amazing chocolate fondu!!!! I will definately return to this tasty find in the west village
I recently went on a date where the gentleman and I had nothing in common and decided to go to Chow Bar
I had a great time! My waiter was friendly and informed about the food and everything was very tasty
Even though the date was a bust, I picked up the tab because the food was a pleasant surprise
If I do have one criticism, it would be that the place does seem kinda trendy but don't let a faux-fabulous clientele keep you from trying it out!!!
The Scene This intimate room (only 11 tables) in the renovated Iroquois Hotel is subtly swank: gentle light flatters and soft music swings
Charming and capable young servers don't need to rush because they never have far to go
Quietly, you feel attended to
The Food There are no avant-garde ingredients or novelty combinations on this French-inspired menu; everything is done with grace, balance and care
If it wasn't so refined, you might call it comfort food
Sauces and reductions are a strong point and vegetables taste of the garden
Acorn squash wontons in herb broth, rabbit "coq au vin," and roast lamb with pancetta are all excellent choices
Little touches that appear at first to be decorative frills--from a thatch of spicy sprouts on top of the roast lamb to the dense raspberry puree painted under the tarte Tatin--add strong, clear flavors, perfectly matched to the dishes
Real value here
Several times to this stellar French venue in midtown
Signature dish scallops - silky mushroom deglaze, scallops themselves beautifully textured-pan-seared to crunchy perfection in beautiful contrast to the natural texture and juiciness of the scallop
Very artful
Muscovy duck-super ingredients and purity of flavor here
Attention to detail, integrity of natural flavors, and excellent service are the hallmarks here
Kudos to Zobel and staff! Not to mention the winelist - try a Nicholas Potel 2002 Burgundy for $36
Wow!
After a long day working in the city this out of towner loves to sit at the bar and graze off the Triomphe menu
The little bar bustles with activity as the theatre crowd and hotels guests come and go
Watch the city gear up and let the bartender select the wine and drinks for each course
First class dining in a first class town
An oasis with subdued lighting, accents of colors, and tiered, recessed ceiling are a wonderful backdrop for a sumptuous meal, elegantly and perfectly presented at every turn
The chef and staff are inviting and exemplify star-level service
great place for both locals and visitors
Friendly staff, great food, reasonably priced
very romantic in a contemporary setting
I hosted a group of 11 adults last June
Every aspect of our wining and dining experience was superb
Youthful, exhuberant, friendly, attentive service
Magnificent food
Marvelous wine selection (correctly poured)
Charming ambience
And excellent value, considering the mid-town location
As an aside, I find that reviewers' comments regarding value (too expensive, overpriced and so on) must be taken with a grain of seasalt, since that is so often a subjective appraisal based on one's position on the socio-economic scale (i
e
, annual income)
Rebuttal to previous post: I frequent Triomphe and see waiters fielding ridiculous questions to provide service for guests
Last week, the poor waitress was asked about the reasoning behind the name of a wine bottle, nothing about the wine itself
Rather than shrug off the question, one of self-indulgent nonsense, she called the wine representative for the answer
The guest then chose another wine, butchering the name of the winemaker in the process, causing the waitress to have to ask the guest to point it out
For the previous poster's reference, I know for a fact that the Moulin de Lagnet is the ONLY red Bordeaux by the glass, so she could not have made that mistake you assume she made
More credit should be given to those that provide not only the transportation of your food, as you put it, but a large part of your overall dining experience
What a nice place in the middle of the city
The food, staff, and drinks were all amazing
Very nice, small and intimate place
I will definitely visit here again
LOVED IT
excellent, intimate restaurant where the attentive friendly waitress actually knew what she was talking about
not too sure about it being that french but they are certainly good wat what they do
If you want to have a quite evening without the noisy crowd see this place
I visited this place on Saturday night and it was a wonderful experience
I would recommend this place for either a romantic or business diner
Triomphe is a wonderful place to dine if you're going to the theatre or not
The food is extraordinary, the service is friendly and professional, and the ambience is wonderful
It's a small and intimate place where the wait staff know what is being served
All four of us had different entrees and we were all delighted
The lamb and guinea hen are fantastic choices
We tried Triomphe for dinner before seeing a show
The food wasn't particulary French, but on average was good
Nothing truly memorable about the meal and no standout dishes
The wine list is competent
I tend to be rather picky, as I dine out a lot, and my companion seemed to enjoy her dinner slightly more than me, although she was not wowed
If you want a solid meal before heading down the street to Broadway, Triomphe definitely is one of the many good choices in the neighborhood
Although next time, I will try a different restaurant in the hopes that I will be wowed
all courses were absolutely amazing, service was attentive, unforgettable experience! wholeheartedly recommend!!!
The food is definitely above your average French cuisine in NYC
Balanced with great ambience (not stuffy old-school decor), elegance, and good service, this is one of the best-kept secrets in the city
Best restaurant in the city! Creative menu and outstanding food! Fantastic service! An experience that my husband and I will always remember! Thank you!
The Triomphe Restaurant is my favorite restaurant
When we go into Manhattan, we always eat at the Triomphe
We have tried other retaurants but none come close to dining at the Triomphe
The atmosphere is wonderful, relaxing and comfortable
The service is terrific, very professional, polite, always consistently fast (especially important when you have a theater date) and they always know the menu and the specials

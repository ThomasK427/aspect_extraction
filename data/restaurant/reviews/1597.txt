The menu takes a Belgian turn with mussels served seven different ways--especially fun when matched with a Belgian beer from an impressive list
The extensive wine list is also strong
This place looks really cool, but I was unimpressed by the food
If it wasn't for the setting it would not be a good experience at all
Oysters were funky tasting
Steak tartar and tuna tartar were not good
I had a really nice bottle of cote de rhone though
While I did enjoy the food, I noticed that everyone around me was stipping at their tables
No, the vast wine list had nothing to do with it
Outside, it wasn't hot or cold, but inside the restaurant, it was a good 90 degrees
I hear that during the summer months, it becomes even more unbearable
Therefore, I wouldn't recommend eating here until the management actually spends some money on air conditioning!
With no pretensions of being haute cuisine, the Steak Frites haters doth protest too much, methinks
We were seated immediately by a cheery hostess, and ordered from an affable if soft-spoken waitress
For our wine they tried to give us little water glasses instead of the Bordeaux mammoths clearly displayed at the bar, but didn't grumble when called on it
When the food came, our runner couldn't keep straight who was to get what (also easily remedied)
My lobster tail was un peu stringy but tasted great
On my filet mignon was a thin glaze of BBQ sauce--a little pedestrian for such a posh cut
Mind that if you order beef, they err on the side of high cooking, i

Medium-well means almost no pink
Overall, I liked the place and will come back--provided they stop playing music by The Roots
Mon dieu, get some Edith Piaf!
Some co-workers and I came here for Restaurant Week lunch
Our waiter, while friendly, seemed confused several times, though he did apologize
Each course - appetizer, entree, and dessert - were all mixed up
Appetizer they brought 2 dishes that weren't even on the prix fixe menu, entree they got the number of entrees right, but gave everyone who ordered the steak, the wrong degree cooked (we were able to switch around), and dessert came out as 4 chocolate mousses and 1 creme caramel instead of the other way around
The food itself was good overall, but inconsistent - absolutely delicious warm mushroom vichysoisse! Steaks were good, frites just OK
Creme caramel would have been better if not for a layer of
I don't know the word, but you know how jello sometimes gets that thin layer of
well i know it when i see it!
I had eaten at this restaurant a few times for lunch and it was fine, but we dropped in on a Friday evening in December and had a terrible meal
My boyfriend got the signature dish, steak frites, and at least 50% of the steak was inedible
We pointed this out to the waiter and then to the manager and they offered us a free desert
At that point, we just wanted to get out of the place
Sure, it was crowded and busy, it was a Friday night in Union Square in December - it should be busy!!! - but the service was totally flustered and remiss
I will not go back, there are plenty of other places in the area that are far superior
If steak frites wasn't located near union square nobody would ever go there
The service was the worst i've ever seen
The waiter took forever to bring anything we asked for and many of the patrons got the wrong order
The food was subpar and the place is way overpriced for the dining experience
Upon leaving, even the hostess admitted to us that she was not suprised by our comments and that the place is extremely poorly run
I ate here with a friend for lunch and noticed that the menu at the restaurant was different from the one shown online
I had my heart set on eating a particular dish and had asked the waiter if there was another menu that had it
Before I was done asking he rudely interrupted me by saying No! Then I wanted to ask him for the specials of the day or anything he would recommend but he walked away in a hurry
It wasn't even busy! Also, I found the service to be very slow and getting the check took even longer
I was also very disappointed in the portion of my meal and the price I paid for it (Thursday special)
Overall, I would NOT recommend this place
After reading all negative reviews I was concerned about taking my family and friends here but we decided to try and were glad we did
We went early, about 5:30 prior to going to a show
There where 7 of us, including 3 teenagers
The staff was very friendly, we were steated immediately (there weren't too many people there at this time), our waiter was excellent answering my wife's friends many many questions with patience, the food was very good
I can not account for all the negative experience but we were all very pleased to have gone
When I politely told the waitress that my steak was way overcooked (I ordered medium rare, on the rare side, and it came out with barely a hint of pink), she seemed to take it really personally
When the new steak came back out, it wasn't even worth the wait of having it re-done
I can make better steak at home, and I'm no chef! Not to mention that the bernaise sauce that was supposed to come with it did not
By the time I got that, also with attitude, my not so great steak was cold
I can't say that any part of the meal was impressive from the fries to the vegitable side (mushrooms) to the bernaise
Steak Frites? More like Charred Meat
I read all your (negative) reviews; maybe lunch is a better time to go? We were there at 12:30; reserved seating was immediate, waiters were perfectly polite and attentive
My Moules Frites en Homard was delicious and my co-worker's Steak Sandwich was also good
The salad with pumpkin seeds and mushroom soup with truffle oil were delicious, too
If you're game to try this place again, do at lunchtime because maybe, as per the other reviews, the cooks and staff become cranky and uncooperative by 6:00
My husband and I waited an hour for two omelettes
Our waiter was confused and forgot an additional soda when we asked for it
It was not even busy in the restaurant and it seemed like all the waiters were running around for no reason
We will never again spend $45 on two omelettes and frustration for what was supposed to be a simple brunch
reading the prior reviews and having my own laque luster expieriences before, I entered Steak Frites this weekend a little gun shy
The hostess, a latino girl, still abressive, the A
C
still not working, and our seeting in the sweltering back of the house
Our server assured us that it would be worth it to stay, still a little iffy we did anyway, and I'll be damned if he was'nt right
We asked for his suggestions on specials, wines and desserts,and were absolutly delighted with all, I had a bone in rib-eye with red peppers and corn that was recomended and deliciouse, as well as the appetizer, wine and dessert suggestions
I will definatly return and always ask for Blake
Save your money eat elsewhere
The hostess was rude and convinced us to come at 930 so we would get better service
The room was hot and there seemed to be no air conditioning
When my wife asked about it in a very polite manner the Hostess said, what are you talking about it is here-we have air conditioning
Imagine
We waited 25 minutes to get water and bread delivered to the table
The waiter was singing while taking our order- the food arrived 30 minutes later and the food was good, but the mules Frites were cold, the steak had to be returned twice-the spinach looked like it was grass from Union Square park with hunks of garlic in it-totally Unacceptable
When we asked for the Manager after waiting 15 minutes he never arrived-so we left-I used to go there all the time-the place has fallen apart
Sad
The first time I was there, the food service was great
but last night, just horrible!! Let me point out, the food still good
but the service was very very disappointed
the waiter didn't recommen any special for the night, didn't come back to the table to check if everything is okay, didn't even offer me the dessert menu at the end
On top of all the bad service, it was like a steam room in the resturant, street temp
was cooler than inside the resturant
I'm just waiting for this place to go belly up
To begin, they have one of the rudest hostesses I've ever encountered
I was meeting a friend who lives around the corner and she told me that I couldn't be seated because it's their policy to only seat entire parties in case someone comes in and wants the table you want and your friend never shows up
Seriously, wow
There were, literally, 4 other people in the place, I think we can all find a place to sit
Bread's good, I can make better french onion soup at home and lobster risotto had salmon in it, which my friend is allergic to - all in all, a disaster that I wish had never happened
It not only took us 25 minutes after our reser vation to be seated, but took another 20 minutes to get menus
Our first round of drinks took anouther 20 minutes with 2 out of 4 coming wrong
The waiter was actually quite accomidating helping us substitues some of our courses, but overall the waiters were unnatentive, unhelpfull, and docile
We were made to feel as if we were a burden by asking for additional ammenities such as an extra plate or balsamic vinegar
No wonder it was one of the only restaurants available for last minute reservations during restaurant week
